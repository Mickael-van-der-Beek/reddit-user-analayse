They also like to say that there's no evidence that CO2 is produced by humans on a sufficient scale- one guy told me that the oceans are the main CO2 source (they absorb more CO2 than they release, which is causing acidification, a whole different problem).

I don't want to say it, but these people are just so misinformed. Why? Is it an intentional act? Is it trolling? Is it pure psychological denial?

Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those nuts who says that climate change is going to cause the entire planet to turn to desert or is going to melt all the ice and make earth like _waterworld_. These people are, if anything, just as harmful to serious climate science than denialists.

Is there some kind of siege of the ill-informed? Could it really be a conspiracy or a concerted trolling effort? How do you fight that?

I just recently sent this PM to someone who asked me about the CO2 lag. Hopefully it will provide some useful information for your own anti-ignorance efforts.

I've already spoken with someone with several similar misconceptions. It is true that, in the prehistoric past, when people weren't adding CO2 to the atmosphere, that as the earth's orbital cycles- the Milankovitch cycles- increased the amount of incoming solar energy, this increased temperatures, which caused a feedback effect over the course of centuries where temperatures increased, ice retreated, and more CO2 was released, which itself caused more temperature increases.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas which increases temperatures, and everything from the recent global trends to small-scale experiments backs this up. There's no scientific controversy over this. In fact, you could reproduce the effect with a thermometer in a jar.

Anyway, this would continue until the cycle gave way to cooling feedbacks as the Milankovitch cycles reversed. I've simplified this a lot, here's a more accurate source.

Now, there are several reasons why we know this is no longer the case today:

    The global temperature change is ten times faster than any natural cycle ever seen. At the end of previous glacial cycles, the earth warmed by one degree a millennium; now it has warmed one degree in a century, and seems to be accelerating.

    Modern warming can't be caused by a change in solar output because the current trend in the Milankovitch cycles has been down, albeit slightly. Some people say that high sunspot activity causes more solar output; other people say that low sunspot activity causes more output. Regardless, there's no correlation between sunspot activity and temperatures one way or the other. As that chart shows, however, there is correlation between modern CO2 release and global average temperatures.

    Atmospheric CO2 has substantially exceeded the levels we've seen in the past. Here's one set of data. As you can see, CO2 has been at concentrations of between 250 to 275 for the past 10,000 years. Here's one that compares the current atmosphere to the one we had over the past few glacial periods.

I want you to take a good long look at that last one. Over the past half a million years (anatomically modern man is only 200,000 years old), the highest atmospheric concentrations of CO2 were around 300 ppm. The lowest has been around 200 ppm. Today, as you may have heard, we've passed 400 ppm- in geologic terms, in the blink of an eye. Here's more proof that it's human-caused CO2 emmissions.

Do you mind if I ask, who told you about the supposed ""lag"" in Co2 rise? I've seen it mentioned elsewhere, and I want to know if there's some specific place that is putting out this misinformation. Is there a website?

------------------

TheEmptyMonty
17 minutes ago ( 1:49 PM)

Just some facts:

1) The greenhouse effect was discovered in 1824 by Joseph Fourier, who calculated that the Earth's atmosphere must have a mechanism for retaining heat; otherwise, nighttime temperatures would be far, far colder due to escaping heat.

2) John Tyndall, a British physicist, constructed the first thermopile in the mid-1850s. This instrument allowed him to characterize the infrared properties of a range of atmospheric gases, including carbon dioxide. He confirmed, and quantified, that carbon dioxide absorbs and reemits infrared radiation, retaining heat.

3) Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish scientist, was lecturing as early as 1896 that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions would cause the planet to warm. He made the first estimates of climate sensitivity, the change in global temperatures corresponding to a change in carbon dioxide, and these estimates have been revised ever since.

4) There was never a name change from ""global warming"" to ""climate change."" The first journal article to ever use the term ""global warming"" was titled ""Climate change: Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?"" (Broecker 1975). Both terms are accurate and refer to different phenomena.

5) On the same note, there was never any scientific consensus in the 1970s that we were approaching an ice age. The majority of scientists predicted warming. A minority of scientists looked at the effects of aerosol sulfates--- small particles that mainly come from coal combustion, and reflect incoming solar radiation back into space--- and saw that they had a dimming and cooling effect. This phenomenon is real and does produce such an effect. While this minority of scientists believed those effects would outweigh the warming effects of carbon dioxide, this proved not to be the case, and the majority warming viewpoint held.

6) We are not currently seeing ""natural variation."" Yes, of course the Earth's climate is always in flux; this is well understood by climatologists, and the idea that they're concluding anthropogenic influence because the climate is changing *at all* is a complete fallacy. In fact, it is only by comparing the current, artificial variation to natural processes that climatologists discern an anomaly to begin with.

7) On a similar note, the climate does continually change, but in predictable, cyclical patterns. If you look at the Milankovitch cycles, you can see that glaciations occur with roughly 100,000 year and 400,000 year periodicity. These timeframes coincide with changes to the eccentricity of Earth's orbit, which plays a big role in how much sunlight reaches the Earth.

8) Each ice age is followed by a post-glacial maximum temperature. The most recent one occurred 8,000 years ago. After this point, in each of the previous cycles as well, there is a slow overall decline in temperatures with minor natural variations that proceeds until the
start of the next ice age. Never in the record has there been a case when, thousands of years after that maximum, temperatures rapidly rose to equal or even exceed the post-glacial peak temperature, until now.

9) Furthermore, the current change in temperature does not conform to previous natural variation. The much ballyhooed medieval warming trend showed a rise of 0.5° C over 800 years. The current rise of 0.8° over 130 years is occurring ten times as fast, and current temperatures exceed those of the medieval period. The bulk of the rise has occurred since the 1960s. Oil production data--- a proxy for fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions--- shows an exponential increase over this time period, coinciding with temperature trends.

10) It is not ""the sun."" First of all, variation in solar output does not track with the current temperature increase. Secondly, even if it did track with temperatures, it makes no logical sense to argue that right around the mid-1960s, the effect of solar variation randomly became much, much greater than it had before. Thirdly, a solar influence would cause universal warming across all layers of atmosphere. However,we are seeing a decrease in stratospheric temperatures along with the increase in tropospheric temperatures. This precludes a solar and demands a terrestrial explanation; only a difference in physical effects of the lower atmosphere explains the divergence in temperature trends. The only physical difference in the lower atmosphere before and after the start of the modern warming trend that accounts for warming is an increased concentration of CO2.

11) Researchers are not doing this ""for the money."" I'm a researcher (not climatology) who has worked on grants from the government as well as contract work for ExxonMobil. Who do you imagine pays better? If there were credible evidence against the scientific consensus on global warming, it would be far, far more lucrative than research confirming the consensus.

12) There was no evidence of wrongdoing or falsification of data in the so-called ""Climategate"" fiasco. A couple sentences were taken completely out of context, and construed to mean different things than they actually did. As just one example, the phrase ""hide the decline"" was construed to mean a decline in temperatures. This is not the case. The ""decline"" is the decline in tree-ring growth that makes modern dendrochronological readings inaccurate. The researchers replaced this data set, which they knew to be inaccurate, with the actual temperature readings averaged at thousands of meteorological stations worldwide. They replaced faulty data with the single most accurate and complete data set available. You can look up the other instances where their research was mischaracterized.

13) Deniers who claim there has been no recent warming are cherry-picking data. Many start their trend with the year 1998, which was extremely warm relative to the years around it, and is thus unsuitable as a starting point for a trend line as it is not representative of average temperatures in that timeframe. I urge anyone who's interested to perform another analysis using 5-year temperature averages, and see what results they get. Furthermore, the 2000s were the hottest decade on record, and each of the last 12 years has been one of the hottest 13 on record (1998 being the exception).

14) According to NASA satellite gravimetry data, the rate of melting of the Greenland ice sheet has nearly doubled in the past decade. It is currently losing roughly 200 billion metric tons of ice annually. Sea level rise is indeed accelerating; the average increase for just the 90s and 2000s is twice the average increase from the 1950s through the 2000s.

There is, of course, a great deal more. But I'm tired of typing these things up. The science is settled, the consensus is clear. Do your due diligence, and actually look into the research, rather than accepting the denier fascination with Al Gore as some kind of evidence against 188 years of climate science. The greenhouse effect was discovered 124 years before he was born, and four years before the Democratic Party was *even founded*. The idea that this is something people have recently made up for some kind of conspiracy is simply untrue, and ignorant of the true history of the discipline. Oh, and one more pet peeve.

Last year I discovered the 2007 IPCC report and was deeply horrified at what I saw. Such a tremendous amount of warming in such a profoundly short period of time. Now the World Bank is predicting that we are on the path towards a warming of four degrees by 2100. When when combined with our overpopulation, it seems completely certain that human civilization will collapse, or begin to collapse by 2050. The effects of climate change will obviously be too great a stressor on our the world's social, political, and economic systems.... 

I honestly feel like I am living in the end times of the human species. It's crazy to think that out the fifty centuries of recorded history, these next fifty years will be the last Is there any hope? Perhaps geoengineering?

There was [one post](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/zlrzu/pdf_global_warming_how_to_approach_the_science_dr/) about Lindzen delusions before congress - of course NOT peer-reviewed science and long debunked.

A somehow interesting thread was [this one about comments regarding the death of one of the biggest assholes in the world](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/zvr9d/warmist_skeptical_science_author_john_hartz_on/) - the most interesting thing resulting there was that [""buddy Poptart""](/user/Poptech) is frequently using the identity of some Andrew Khan (among probably many others - I now also suspect that [publius_lxxii](/user/publius_lxxii) is somehow a full-time employee in some climate denial operation).

Other than the visit from Poptart there have been two other trolls re-emerging - [sdevijver](/user/sdevijver) and [Sunsettommy](/user/Sunsettommy) - I suspect that those could be the same moron, since I remember the second tried before to troll us and this time the other account tried in an even more stupid way involving total rejection of any peer-review science :)

There have been other ""fresh"" accounts - [GovernmentGrantMoney](/user/GovernmentGrantMoney) could be the moderator [kokey](/user/kokey) - former [gst](/user/gst) and now slowly abandoning [ManBearPigg](/user/ManBearPigg) after I exposed him.

Almost everything else - like over 20-30 posts - was about the Lewandowsky social study - the funniest part was that one poster tried to start a [somehow related poll](http://www.reddit.com/r/climateskeptics/comments/zu1vx/too_much_fake_debate_on_lewandowsky_lets_settle/) - but of course that all the deniers that invent crap on how it is all a left-wing conspiracy now consider themselves ""center or center-left"" - going as far as to say ""voting 3rd party"" just to cover for their libertard vote - the dishonesty of [Will_Power](/user/Will_Power) is now as legendary as his complete ignorance :)",,False,,t5_2qhx3,False,,,True,t3_zxnz3,http://www.reddit.com/r/climate/comments/zxnz3/catching_up_with_the_local_deniers_stuff_from/,

One in particular. In the early years of AIDS it was becoming increasingly clear that it was being spread via blood (this was before the virus was discovered). Babies were getting ill as were drug users. But there was resistance from the blood bank industry, which attacked the science and epidemiological work  making these connections. That didn't last long because the accelerating rate of infections made it impossible to ignore the problem. 

However, here's another way to look at how the AIDS epidemic unfolded. Imagine that each year of the initial outbreak was actually 10 years. Something akin to dog's life math. And all of a sudden it begins to look like what's going on with climate change. If you use the decade of the 1990s as year one, (Hansen's testimony in 1988 as the starting point) then we are in year 2.5 of real climate change awareness and action. 

The first Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on what would eventually became known as AIDS appeared on June 5, 1981. It received little attention. The national news media only gave AIDS attention when it began to expand beyond the gay population, and even then attention was minimal. Policy makers, with few exceptions, ignored it. It wasn't until the problems cascaded and the number of cases grew that AIDS became a true national issue. 

This past June marked the 25th anniversary of Hansen's testimony, and I would say that the awareness and level of action about climate change is about on par with AIDS at its 2.5 year point. It took about five years for AIDS to get truly recognize for what it was. Although the deniers (and that includes people who considered it a gay disease alone) were still at work five years into the AIDS epidemic, they were being marginalized. But it took about five years for the U.S. to begin to turn real attention and money toward combating AIDS.

It will take another 25 years before the world is truly ready to deal with climate change. By then, the polar cap should be just about gone if not gone. The evidence from Greenland, Antarctica, and temperature records, will be inescapable. Similar to the number of AIDS cases at the five year point, the evidence will be beyond rational dispute.  Today, the people who deny climate change, the policy makers who refuse to deal it, and a public that refuses to understand it, still hold sway. Such as it was with AIDS when you adjust the time scales. We have a long way to go before real action is possible.
