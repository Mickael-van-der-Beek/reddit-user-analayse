Welcome People of Reddit (And the 3,540 damn commies so far who have downvoted this.)

Our Judge presiding will be /u/MrFace1

* No further production of this case will be moved until **Wednesday April 17th** to give downtime for the families &amp; friends of ours in Boston who are currently experiencing this tragedy. Our thoughts are with you.

* No Charges will be filed at this time until the proceeding date listed above, the charges will be decided by our fellow peers in the comments below, those upvoted the highest will obviously be our lead charges heading into prosecution.

* Someone who thinks they are brave enough is still needed to represent the defendant in this case.

* Please follow these subs below since the mods of /r/worldnews are douches, also please note that no one is currently sure **which mods were present for today's ultimate douchebaggery** We expect the mods who were present and did the deleting to be present and address the court.

* The Subs I would suggest to follow are

1. /r/news
2. /r/boston
3. /r/murica

Thank you.

**EDIT 10PM EST:** Alright everyone I have been reading everyone's comments as they have been pouring in and these are the following rules that will be enacted.

* A jury will be selected Wednesday as several people have requested to be jurors and we will have to decide on a set number of them

* several people have requested to be the defense's attorney, the defense will have say on who they would like to represent them, following approval from our judge(s)

* Due to the large scale of this case we will have 3 judges to provide a fair unbiased trial and make sure all ground is covered

* The actual case will be held in a different thread that only the users in representation of the case will be able to comment on

* lastly do not downvote or attack the /r/worldnews mods. It may have not been all of them and I would like to place the pitchfork and torch to em' all too after today but we are a justly community, amirite?

Good luck to our Boston family and we hope all is well for you and look forward to speedy recoveries and we mourn our losses today, and for everyones sake, around the world. Because as we all know shits getting real everywhere all the time and we just don't hear about it until it strikes home. Thank you.

The post quickly rose to the front page, and as of 6:47 P.M., it has accumulated 8,042 karma and much praise in the comments section.  It should be noted that /u/VolumeZero's *total* link karma as of this moment is 4,901.  
  
Unfortunately, contrary to what VolumeZero would have you believe, he found this ""jackpot"" not at a yardsale, [but on imgur](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1idrzr/whats_your_current_reason_for_being_unhappy/cb420sf).  In fact, /u/VolumeZero's disgracefully reposted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1ife7v/i_just_found_this_steal_of_a_deal_at_a_yard_sale/) post from /u/utterpedant not even two hours after the original was posted, and got away with over 3 times the Karma in the process .  This shameless act caused untold psychological damage to /u/utterpedant, who was understandably distraught, as can be seen in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ifn7l/cant_believe_what_i_found_at_the_yard_sale/cb40rpa) comment on the post.
  
This shameless case of grandtheft.jpg is worthy of the highest possible punishment.  Justice *will* be upheld!  
  
EDIT: This disgusting repost has become the all time best comment on /r/gaming.  This has elevated the stakes even higher.  Capitol punishment is not out of the question.  
  
EDIT #2: It appears that /u/VolumeZero has started an avalanche of lawlessness across the internet.  A quick search on KarmaDecay reveals that this post has been reposted at least four times within the past three hours by lowly beings such as ~~/u/Checksbounce~~ *(Acknowledged that it was a repost in title)*, /u/pikk and /u/bob___dull.  WHEN WILL THIS MADNESS END???

1. Russian

2. Japanese

3. A linguist

4. A teacher, for over 20 years

5. A tattoo artist

Some of these might be true. However, we do not know which ones, nor is there any evidence to suggest they are not all lies. Therefor, I charge /u/The_Horse_Yeller with two charges of felony douchebaggery (for the nationalities) and three charges of misdemeanor douchebaggery (for the professions, which I find less severe).

The 6st charge of douchebaggery is for the broken english /u/The_Horse_Yeller uses when he pretends to be Russian. He does not use this in any other context.

* His answers:

&gt; Q: do you record your own voice and listen to how amazing it is?

&gt; A: yes!

&gt; Q: If you could have dinner with three people, living or dead, who would they be?

&gt; A: Jesus, Adolf Hilter, and Barack Obama

&gt; Q: Do you get requests from random people to read things aloud for you?

&gt; A: They dont get passed my agent!

&gt; Q: What has been your goal in life?

&gt; A: To be in the movies!

They speak for themselves.

&gt; I don't believe this is the real Morgan either. He said here in the AMA when asked ""If you weren't an actor, what other career would you have gone into? What other jobs would you like to try out?"" and he replied with ""I probably would be a chauffeur"" ([**Proof**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1c5zxh/i_am_morgan_freeman_ask_me_anything/c9dctq8)).

It is not uncommon for people to lie on the internet, we all know this. However, the events of 9/11 are heavy on all of our hearts and will be for the remainder of our lives. We all owe thanks to the true heros of 9/11 and this should not stand!

Evidence that does not line up:

/u/Spaghettimonnster claims to be a 14 year police officer/swat, saved numberous lives, and has died twice since 9/11 due to his heart stopping. 

/u/Spaghettimonnster has been a reddit user for 6 months. His post history includes mentions of things that does not align with a retired police officer. Comments on where he will travel for spring break, posts about something he found in his spanish textbook, having a black baby with a white woman, even mentions of having slaves.

/u/Spaghettimonnster recently asked on another AMA ""I am a Police Officer. Ask Me Anything"" an interesting question.  
http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/137ypz/i_am_a_police_officer_ask_my_anything/c71rckf

/u/Spaghettimonnster provided verification in the way of a few pictures of someone posing near ""the pile"". In the months following 9/11 there were probably thousands of workers have similar pictures and this is an incredibly weak ""proof"".

In general, begin to look into this and you will see there are several stories that were woven. Some mention this may have been his father posting on his son's account, well this father must have been part of the elite Port Authority SWAT team? 

We the people of Reddit should not stand for this! People claiming to be 9/11 heroes are the worst kind of people, the true heroes of that day and the rest of us should get to the bottom of this!

*Edit: Link fixed

**EDIT2: Im going to go CASE CLOSED here with the following likely explination:**
*OP Has a father that worked (alongside thousands of others) assisting with the cleanup efforts
*OP has heard various stories from this father, and think of his father as a hero
*OP created an AMA that exploded on him, and decided to answer for the father
*OP's father probably has no knowledge of this AMA
*OP is messing with things that should not be messed with.
*OP: Guilty of impersonating a 9/11 Hero. 


**IN THE EVENT** that OP provides proof of this all being a misunderstanding, I in no way would intend to berate a 9/11 hero. At this time: I will stand to my ground that this is low, and sick, and OP has walked himself into a corner.

This is by all means an extreme account of douchebaggery and Public Indecency to such an extent that I believe a new charge should be created: Kimjongun.jpg, comparing to the massive power trip that Kin Jong Un has had after acquiring nuclear weapons (similar to mod powers on reddit).

**SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE:**

*EXHIBIT A:* 

/u/REDDIT- was recently banned from /r/lgbt after (quoting /u/REDDIT-) 
&gt;[He] got into an argument with one of the lgbt mods in an unrelated subreddit (unbeknownst to [him]), and [/u/robotanna] wound up banning me from all of the subreddits she moderates for some reason

This obviously falls outside of the jurisdiction of /u/robotanna's mod power and is a textbook case of kimjongun.jpg.  Photographic evidence of the crime has been provided [here](http://i.imgur.com/JQpCPhO.png).

*EXHIBIT B:*

In the aforementioned private conversation between /u/REDDIT- and /u/robotanna, /u/robotanna has exhibited signs of chronic psycho bitch syndrome during a [private conversation between the two](http://i.imgur.com/JQpCPhO.png), calling Reddit a ""hate group"" and accusing /u/REDDIT- of being a ""creep.""

*EXHIBIT C:*

Apparently, this is nothing new.  In January of 2012 users of /r/lgbt decided to take matters into their own hands as they [violently revolted against their moderators in repeated swarms of downvotes](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ya05n/recap_the_tale_of_rlgbt_part_i/).  It is about high time that these actions be brought up with the court.

**CONCLUSION:**

This sort of immature behavior is disgraceful to our reddit community and reflects poorly on a sense of tolerance and equality that reddit so much deserves.  Hear, hear!

**EDIT: BREAKING NEWS!**  
In light of this recent investigation, /u/RobotAnna has showed more signs of sexist bigotry and insults against the court.  One of the first comments to show up in this thread is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cwbcd/the_people_of_reddit_vs_urobotanna_and_the_mods/c9klkt3) comment, where /u/RobotAnna willingly flips off the court:  
&gt;here is my deposition

&gt;t(o_o)t

This is obviously unacceptable and attempts to completely undermine the absolute and perfect authority of our court.  This heresy cannot and will not be allowed!


Additionally, /u/nekosune has confirmed /u/REDDIT-'s ban [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cwbcd/the_people_of_reddit_vs_urobotanna_and_the_mods/c9klasu).  There is no no doubt that /u/REDDIT-'s accusations are true, and it seems that most people in the comments are in mutual agreement.  Also in the comments many redditors are sharing their stories about /u/RobotAnna's sexist douchebaggery.

Good people of KarmaCourt, today I bring a most heinous crime before you. A crime that preys upon the redditor's most basic instinct.

It was on the date of the 14th of December that /u/ThetrueGizmo made this post. Without in any way contributing a topic of conversation, the accused suggests that they will be making a post to /r/gonewild. Desperate comments and upvoting began immediately, and in short order the post was on the front page.

*whip snaps*

The prosecution asserts that the accused had no intention of EVER posting to /r/gonewild . As proof, the prosecution presents the following evidence from the user's post history.

http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/14u6cq/oh_the_romantics_in_my_relationship/

Through this evidence, it can be plainly seen that /u/ThetrueGizmo is in a relationship, and is therefore extremely unlikely to ever post to /r/gonewild in the near future. We assert that the defendant did knowingly and willfully deceive reddit into parting with their karma, and I, Franziska Von KarmaHo, do hereby official charge /u/ThetrueGizmo with one count of Karma Fraud, one count of Failing to Deliver, and one count of OP Is A Faggot. The prosecution also demands that we begin - and place /u/ThetrueGizmo on - the equivalent of a sex offender registry, proposed title being ""OP is a Faggot Registry"".

*curtsy*

That is all.

**TL;DR** In summary, OP used the promise of boobs to fraudulently reap large amounts of karma, already being a girl on reddit. This is the equivalent of a spoiled rich kid dressing up like a homeless man and asking for change. Knowing and willful deception for the purposes of gaining karma was commited, and we demand the maximum punishment allowable under reddit law.

*Edit:* In what I'm reasonably sure is a first for Karma Court, the defendant has given testimony confessing to their crime. While countless posts in the original thread will reveal literally hundreds of redditors have wasted hours of their lives F5'ing, the prosecution accepts this guilty plea and moves for a reduced sentence. We no longer wish to place /u/ThetrueGizmo on the OP Is A Faggot Registry, but we do still request such a registry be made. The prosecution rests its case and awaits sentencing from an appointed judge.",,False,,t5_2v788,1355500328.0,,,True,t3_14uge7,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/14uge7/uthetruegizmo_gone_wild_telling_lies/,

My evidence can be found in a [PREVIOUS THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/1id7lv/the_conan_social_media_team_are_using_bots_to/) which I created highlighting my suspicions. But from that post came more evidence and users who also support my claim. Check that post for more information.

____________________

* I have been lurking on reddit for over a year now and I have noticed that these Conan joke reposts are FREQUENTLY and CONSISTENTLY hitting the front page capping out over 2100 upvotes per post. This is not a recent occurrence.

* These posts are very quick to amass a bunch of upvotes, usually getting around 5 upvotes a second. Even after these posts make it to the front page the comment section is usually dead with around 50-150 comments, other posts on /r/funny usually get over 500 or more with the same amount of upvotes.

* On [THIS POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1icfb0/well_definitely_he_is/) it has currently gotten 1900 points. I posted a comment when it was at 1200 points and within 20 minutes it had broken the 2000 mark. The post peaked at 2900 points and then was mass downvoted to 1900.

* [Another Conan Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i9hnm/conan_explains_the_obvious/) hit the front page on 15th July and has 2037 upvotes with only 160 comments. A large portion of random comments in that thread are massively downvoted for no reason.

so within two days two Conan posts have made the front page with minimal comments.

* [Heres one from 6 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i1sjs/conan_is_excellent/) 2772 upvotes but comments are at 700 here. 

Those are just the recent ones.

* A redditor by the name of /u/AltRedditAcc replied to my comment saying  

&gt;""I've seen countless of other submissions reaching frontpage with ~2k upvotes and near no comments, only to see comments flooding in as soon as I saw the submission myself.
Definitly bought upvotes. There's no way thousand people upvote without commenting and then suddenly everyone stops lurking.
I'm actually surprised noone brings that up ever... until now."" 

* Another reddior /u/junkshez said this.
&gt; I remember messaging one of the mods on /r/funny  in February about a Conan post that reached almost 4000 points.
A lot of these ""fake views"" posts are fairly obvious, I used to see them a lot on YouTube where a user with 100 subs had over 100k views on his videos with only 10 comments.

* From what I can tell the posts are not being posted by bots but rather regular redditors. This means that the posters are not associated to the PR team and usually have no idea about it. A possible scenario could be that bots scan and find these Conan joke images and give them a shot of upvotes to increase their visibility and have other normal redditors do the rest. These bots probably bugged out which is why you sometimes see mass upvotes or downvotes on random posts/comments.

* /u/romz7 replied telling us what happened regarding his post. 
&gt;I have no idea about the bots voting or anything but yes it was the first time any of my posts got up voted in such a short period of time. I was at about 100 up votes in the first hour and then by two and half hours I was almost on the front page. After that, it had a lot of down votes.Even my comments were down voted for no reason.

* Redditor /u/Wylye claims this sort of thing is happening on other sites too. Heres his quote.
&gt;I've seen it happening on other sites as well. Fark.com always seems to have at least active TeamCoco branded link in their video tab per week, despite all the comments being negative. It was pretty much all but admitted they were buying the space.

________

This evidence may not exactly be airtight but there certainly is some foul play involved here.

Long time lurkers have definitely noticed these weird threads and something must be done about this.

The thread in question:

http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1gbg6p/got_a_horrible_cough_to_the_point_of_not_being/


His story, as can be seen in his comments, doesn't match up; Repeatedly saying he feels fine and cant afford to go to the doctor then switching back to 'I'll post tomorrow with an update from the doctor after work'

Supporting evidence I present:

The website posted this just minutes before the link was submitted to reddit.
http://heresalink.com/7e5b84

Not to mention heresalink.com doesn't get much web traffic:

http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/heresalink.com#

This coupled with the fact that his profile is just minutes older than his first post makes me think he's probably one of the few to use that site and when he saw this picture decided to reap the karma.

/u/illusionist_94 has been found guilty of multiple counts of liarliarpantsonfire.txt and 1 count of massive douchebaggery.

/u/Reemusk and /u/Andrewsmith1986 wanted to set up cases against some of the biggest redditors, including /u/apostolate and /u/shittywatercolour. The newsarticle:

&gt;KARMACOURT GAZETTE STAFF

&gt;Earlier today, [an informant operating under a throwaway account leaked a screencapture to the Gazette](http://imgur.com/6YHbXYp), alleging that approximately one week ago, a ""power user"" solicited his assistance in a nefarious plot: Utilize the public forum of /r/KarmaCourt to defame prominent redditors by skewing public opinion against them.

&gt;As the facts in this story are impossible, at this point, to verify, and in the interest of providing both timely and factual reporting, we are posting the entire contents of the two messages sent to us by the informant.

&gt;&gt;Hello, authors of the Karma Court Gazette. I use this throwaway account because of the sensitivity of the material I pass on to you, material that implicates very powerful men in a site-wide conspiracy- one that that will shake the foundations of reddit and one that is based in none other than our Karma Court. &gt; &gt;Let me start, as I am wont to do, at the beginning. &gt; &gt;I am a powerful user in /r/KarmaCourt- although you may not recognize my name, you would certainly recognize the things I have done behind the scenes. It is of no matter, as I will divulge neither. &gt; &gt;I was contacted about a week ago by a reddit ""power user""- in fact, the most powerful user of them all. He asked me to help him with the first step of his plan, which utilized Karma Court to change the public opinion of several other power users. Karma Court, he said, was unique in that it often decided the opinions of the entire site, and it could be rigged by a few users. &gt; &gt;We were those few users. &gt; &gt;I can not give more information without divulging my identity, but I have attached proof of what I have said so far. Suffice it to say that powerful men are working to use and then destroy Karma Court. &gt;The first visible message refers to/r/ReddiquetteCourt. &gt; &gt;http://imgur.com/6YHbXYp &gt; &gt;Thank you for your time. I trust that you will know what to do with this information- unveil the conspiracy before it is completed. I will never log into this account again. Do not attempt to find my real identity or contact me. &gt; &gt;May God have mercy on our souls.

&gt;The following was received less than an hour later.

&gt;&gt;I told you I would not log into this account again, but I have never been one for keeping my word. I just wanted to let you know what happened after the conversation that I posted happened: &gt;Everyone involved in the conversation, with the exception of ALBERMAU5 and Reemusk's alternate account was demodded by their own volition. &gt; &gt;They currently appear to have no connection to the subreddit. &gt;The plan is now to lie low until the cases are brought against the power users, then ReddiquetteCourt will make their move. This will happen over a period of weeks. ReddiquetteCourt is incidental to their - to our - plans- as long as KarmaCourt is disbanded, we do not care about the fate of /r/reddiquettecourt. We are now communicating via email rather than reddit messages. &gt; &gt;The other thing is that I said ""half of karma court are either on our side or sockpuppets"", but that wasn't true. Three accounts are sock puppets, and two moderators are on our side.

&gt;If these allegations hold any shred of truth, it would appear that there has been for some time an active cabal of dissenters within the already drama-ridden /r/KarmaCourt. Whether we can believe the informant's claim that these machinations are actively targeting individual users, or whether the aim is simply to widen the already prominent schism within the court's moderatorship, remains to be seen.

&gt;At the time of this article's publication, the Gazette was unable to confirm which subReddit this modmail originated from.

&gt;The Gazette is in the process of determining the veracity of the information leaked to us. Please stay tuned for round-the-clock coverage of this momentous turn of events.

As seen here, the screenshot: http://imgur.com/6YHbXYp

All I fear now, is that this conspiracy may cost me my head. What I am saying here, goes against the will of powerfull redditors. If the plan on ruining others reputations, why not mine as well...

-----

I would first like to thank you for making it this far. What you are about to read may be lengthy, but I feel it's time to bring change through the Karma Court, and I believe the change is being obstructed by the Moderators of /r/KarmaCourt, and so something must be done about it. 

So I bring you today my charges against the Moderators of /r/KarmaCourt.

The charge: Article III, Section B.2, Item F:

&gt; **Obstruction of Justice** - Impeding or obsfucating an investigation, such as submitting false screenshots, deleting evidence, or providing false evidence to the court.

I believe the moderators of /r/KarmaCourt are guilty of Obstruction of Justice in so far as they do not adhere to their position by keeping the court in order nor do they even properly update court information and resources. For example, the [most visible link to the Constitution](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/wiki/constitution#LABEL-CONST) is outdated, being updated a month ago (~January 20) while the people of /r/KarmaCourtDrafters have fixed some of the flaws pointed out and created a [properly formated constitution](http://piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/ro.Nxo9wz9P0$gW3KM94F/latest), which is still not all that impressive.

A moderators duty, as defined by the constitution:

&gt; J.  Moderator - A Redditor who has the responsibility to keep tabs on a subreddit and keep it in line.  **A moderator in /r/KarmaCourt must be able to judge cases, settle constitutional disputes, and establish new precedents when needed.**

I would further go on to charge the Justice's with Article III, Section B.1, Item E, but on a much larger scale, making it a felony:

&gt; **Time-wasting** - When a Redditor brings a frivolous lawsuit or files frivolous charges. Note, however, that this is not meant to discourage people from filing suit.

I believe the moderators are guilty of providing a frivolous sub-reddit where a majority of cases remain unsolved for extensive periods of time. They say that we take this sub-reddit too seriously, but a vast majority seem to be taking it seriously. While I agree this is for fun in order to show Karma isn't to be taken too seriously, we are still obligated to close these cases. Yet, in their own constitution, one can be charged for bringing frivolous lawsuits or charges. 

Do you know what the definition of frivolous is? Carefree and Not Serious. So they are telling us to only bring serious cases to the court, but not to take them seriously. Incredible.

This is their opinion, and so they don't even seem to be taking into consideration the view of their user base, which should be a crime in itself.

----

It is time for change in the KarmaCourt. It is not what it was, and those who preside over it should welcome change as the Court continues to grow and begin to be taken seriously. If [these estimates are correct](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourtDrafters/comments/1838eq/proposal_creation_of_an_official_executive_branch/c8izd6p), we are gaining 190 new subscribers a day. In time the court will be a massive circlejerk.

I bring my case against each individual Justice in the comment section.

As we have no Justice without Bias in this case, I call for a trial by Juror or no less than 3 and no more than 7.

EDIT: Should the outcome be unanimous or should it be majority?


EDIT II: I hereby add the charges of Douchebaggery to /u/thelovepirate for any and all comments he has made in this thread.

&gt; (a). Douchebaggery - A catch-all offence for when the accused is being deceitful or intentionally misleading. **Douchebaggery can be added to any existing charge before the court if the accused obfuscates the process of justice by acting like a dick**. May also be a felony if the douchebaggery is deemed severe enough by the judge.    


EDIT III: Due to the nature of the thread and the fact that it was not a mediation but instead an unorganized argument against me leading to downvotes of comments from a group discussion that was to be me versus the moderators, I have deleted the mediation thread.


EDIT IV: A lovely insight from a previous Moderator of this subreddit, that I will not name:

&gt; ""disbarred =/= disrobed""

What I see going on is several more moderators being added, possibly preparing for the worse. They are adding moderators that have not had prior connection to this sub-reddit, so my only thought is that they are replacing these accounts with their multiple account to squash this mess.

EDIT V: I would like to point out [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/16mc3g/meta_i_must_ask_this_to_everyone_of_karmacourt/c7xrvzm) made by a new member of the Moderation team one month ago before being made a moderator.

&gt; ""It would be a silly court if I was a mod, I guarantee you.""

Exhibit A: [The post in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1eziym/a_redditor_found_my_locker_and_left_this_note_as/)

Here, menwithrobots has submitted a post where a creepy classmate sends a letter and a fedora into his locker. Within the note are several cringe-inducing elements, that questions the reader if the post is real or not. 

Exhibit B: [Fedora]( http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1eziym/a_redditor_found_my_locker_and_left_this_note_as/ca5d0gv) 

While Investigator /u/BaDumPshhh went through OP's post history, he discovered the same fedora in an earlier submitted post, showing the OP in possession of the same fedora in question. We can deduce that the fedora in the OP's /r/cringe post is the same fedora he is wearing in the video; thus making the original post fake in order to obtain karma. 

Lying for karma, I can understand.. But actually OWNING a fedora? Ugh!

Karma from reposting: between 6400-6500 link karma

Karma received while not acknowledging the cross posts: also between 6400-6500 link karma

from my findings I discovered that most of these posts mentioned above have happened in the last two weeks, mostly through going through different subreddits and posting top pics to others. Also used was reposting pics over 1 year old. I will not be the prosecution for this case, seeing as this user is a Judge of this subreddit this could be considered a touchy subject. I am also unaware on the courts ruling of failing to acknowledge cross posting, but considering the amount of karma It was included.





**Edit:**  previously the defendant claimed that if he was going to post something and noticed that it didn't do well in karma decay, then he would try it for himself, here is an example of an attempt that failed in the last 12 hours.

Good afternoon. Today I, /u/spaceye, am opening a case against /u/FredJetson for stealing my Original Created Content. /u/FredJetson submitted my content before Reddit had seen it, netting him karma and a spot on the front page.

** **

My testimony is as follows:

On the evening of February 13, 2013, I [created an image and uploaded it to Imgur (**Exhibit A**)](http://i.imgur.com/dm6Lb81.jpg). While chatting on a third party service with friends later that evening, I shared that link with the room. I asked them to not share it, as I would submit it to Reddit the next day. One of the users in that room was Redditor /u/FredJetson. [/u/FredJetson submitted that link to /r/funny that same evening under the title ""Celebrating our eighteenth anniversary together!"" (**Exhibit B**)](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/18hwfq/celebrating_our_eighteenth_anniversary_together/).

Today, February 14, 2013, I awoke to see my content, as submitted by /u/FredJetson, on the front page of Reddit in /r/all, in the #17 position [as evidenced by this screenshot (**Exhibit C**)](http://i.imgur.com/uQsW2XB.jpg). [I commented on that submission validating that it was indeed me, to the apparent approval of voters (**Exhibit D**)](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/18hwfq/celebrating_our_eighteenth_anniversary_together/c8f31nr).

To further validate my identity, I have taken [a photo of me in the same spot where I took the original image (**Exhibit E**)](http://i.imgur.com/lCYm93f.jpg).

** **

As there is no outlined charge in the Constitution for stealing original content from another Redditor before it is posted to Reddit, I am demanding the equivalent of /u/FredJetson's post in karma in damages (1,174 as of this writing) on the basis of Douchebaggery.

&gt;        Defense: CrazedHobo111
___________________________
&gt;We, the denizens of /r/circlejerk, hereby file suit against the user /u/realhermit.

&gt;The user in question has recently filed a Reddit lawsuit against one of our fearless euphoric leaders with the charges of karma whoring and insider karma trading.

&gt;Not only are these claims false, they also demonstrate malice and a thorough intent to defame the community of /r/circlejerk.

&gt;We are a peaceful people. We accept users of all creed. We even accepted /u/realhermit. But this wasn't enough for him. 

&gt;In the early hours of the 14th of February, this, the year two-thousand and thirteen, realhermit [posted a thread on circlejerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/18iw8r/i_saw_batman_and_nightwing_but_they_wouldnt_sign/) during the great link opening of February. 

&gt;This thread did not represent our community and it, therefore, fell just as quickly as it came to existence. 

&gt;In what is clearly a case of spite and animosity at the lack of reception of this post on our communities page, the user in question sought to take down the sanctity of our page and the reputation of our moderators. 

&gt;In filling a lawsuit with no basis against a community that has allegedly wronged him, he has caused unrest amongst our people. 

&gt;Though the case was dismissed by the honorable KoreanTerran, the damage has been done. 

&gt;While filing the case against our fearless leader, he used 'Reddit' as the prosecution. We, the people of circlejerk, do not all agree with this charge and are therefor mischaracterized as rebellious to our moderators. Out of courtesy, the countless charges of perjury have been dropped by the prosecution.

I'd like to take this time to remember all of the good things he did here. And that time incidentally took about one (1) second. Thank you for the awesome judge and jury members and thank you everyone for making this place awesome.


Dear members of the court,

I thank you for your time and would like to welcome you to this case. I stand before you today as a near defeated man. I was about to give up on the court and my modship alike. One month ago, /r/KarmaCourt gave mod permissions to one (1) /u/EveryoneHasPotential . He was elated to receive the honor and vowed to use his powers for good. However, since receiving said powers, he has not posted in this sub once. He has tried to make various people mod without consulting anyone else from the mod team on a few separate occasions. I accuse him of trying to get his friends involved as an attempt to one day overthrow our beloved courtroom. His actions lead to some of the lower mods (myself humbly included) having their permissions ""scaled down"" from full permission.

I present:

 [Exhibit A](http://imgur.com/ZrWN9Ef)

and 

[Exhibit B](http://imgur.com/iw6A3g2)


The charge for spamming is from the defendant blowing up modmail on a regular basis with this [.Gif](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view/401923/dancing-lobsters-o.gif) and other various nonesense. He was asked and even warned by /u/KoreanTerran / /u/Fastball360 to stop spamming the Modmail system. His response? He removed his own modmail privleges and left us with this:

[Exhibit C](http://imgur.com/C1bbTqZ) [My evidence for Douche baggery]


I request that /u/Everyonehaspotential have their mod-permissions lowered even further, so that they may modify post flairs and moderate comments. I request that he subscribe to [/r/lobsters]  (http://www.reddit.com/r/lobsters) and masturbate exclusively to [this](http://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/amanda-bynes-getting-ready-video-lead.jpg?w=600) picture of Amanda Bynes.

A reddit account of seven hours that goes on default subs, posts ""Game of Thrones"" spoilers and makes old meme jokes about skyrim guards, beating a horse so dead that is basically dust by now, probably with a shitty grin on his face throughout.

He is being downvoted to hell and back. Some might think that that would be enough punishment. 
But I think more should be done.
If we let this kind of people rummaging through our reddit, YOU could be next. YOUR CHILD could be next.

I, for one, ask the judges to sentence him to the death penalty.
I do not think that the mental illness could be applied to this case. He has two accounts, so he is in his full state of mind.

EDIT: It was brought to my attention that, in case a Judge and Defendant should be nomined, that they have to have read the whole series or don't care about being spoiled (we being on Reddit I think the latter would be rarer than the former), since all the evidence of the prosecuted's misdeeds are in form of spoiler to the series ""Game of Thrones""

I apologize for all harm brought to you, and I apologize if anyone actually got offended. However, if someone gets offended by posts submitted by *le guy who talkes liek dis*, they should look in the mirror and ask themselves: ""Do I get provoked too easily?""

I wouldn't personally call my acts *trolling*, as my main objective was *not* to offend any of you. Instead, I was merely investigating the responses ""I'd"" get. This is, after all, only a novelty account. Nothing more or less than that.

If acting like an idiot is illegal according to this subreddit, I definitely am guilty, and ready to face trial, possibly conviction aswell.

**Prosecution's opening statements:**

Edit: I would like to open the prosecution's argument if it pleases the court:

*If it pleases the court, please read the following in the voice of a southern lawyer in a white suit with suspenders:* 

As expressed in [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette), which as we all know was created by the founders who created this great website, voting, and thus the resulting karma, is a currency expressing trust and good content.  Yes, siirka's content was good, but it did not uphold the sanctity of trust.  And what, ladies and gentlemen of the jury is that trust composed of?  Well if I may quote our great moderators directly from [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) it is composed of

&gt;**Search[ing] for duplicates before posting.**

A simple search, ladies and gentlemen, could've found every one of these images were posed and already popular. However I believe this breech of trust goes further than forgetting to do a simple search because as reddiquette says

&gt;[do not] **Post hoaxes.** 

Ladies and gentlemen, the following is clearly a hoax most likely created by siirka him(?)self, if you have small children or are faint of heart I would ask that you leave the courtroom now: http://i.imgur.com/50Kc9sy.jpg   

Original from two months ago: http://d.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YKnU9gH13QNItfTE.jpg

Yes and this plot goes deeper still to the point where this user claims to have made a senior prank while the poster of the [content originally] (http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1bx8r5/senior_prankevery_cup_has_water_in_it/c9b0q5q), one /u/Jewdene,  is not even mentioned and the title implies that siirka committed this small act of vandalism.

And lastly ladies and gentlemen, this user is guilty of one of the most heinous crimes, as stated in the [Karmacourt Constitution] (http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/wiki/constitution#LABEL-LAWREVIEW) under Article 3, section B: Examples of Charges

&gt;(e). GrandTheft.jpg - Reposting while claiming credit for the post.

GrandTheft.jpg has a maximum sentence of

Which the prosecution looks for.

So Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, is this the kind of user you want out there in the /r/funny or in the /r/pics taking karma from decent, hard working folk like /u/Jewdene, /u/kcrussell, and /u/colacube, or is this the type of user you want to be safely locked up by public shaming and told politely to go fuck himself.

**Result:** Prosecution drops all charges except 1 misdemeanor charge of not linking to artist and 2 misdemeanor charges of minor Douchebaggery, Defendant pleas guilty to charges

**Evidence:**

At or around 9am PST, I posted this link to the above mentioned sub-reddit: [Exhibit A] (http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude/comments/1d7xlj/a_look_inside_gif/)

At approx. 4pm PST, a moderator cleverly named /u/woahdude_moderator  removed my post and explained thoroughly that it was for indeed, a repost (GASP!!?!?!)

However, before and even after it was falsely removed, I [Karmadecayed](http://karmadecay.com/) it. Not a single hit. I took the liberty of searching through no less than 300 of the top, all time posts on /r/woahdude dude. After my results were nil, I wrote the defendant to ask for an explanation, to no avail.

To further try and give the benefit of the doubt to the defendant, who was only doing his ""job"", I looked at the side-bar for more info. Not a single rule against reposting. So, even if I accidently reposted, nowhere is it written, expressed or implied that reposts are against that sub-reddit's rules.

I am aware of the importance of stopping me from getting 35 upvotes is, so I ask for a fair trial, and ask no downvote brigades come from this. I only seek justice and jimmy-rustlin'.

Presenting charges against the mods of /r/cringepics for wrongful enforcement of misleading rules.

Charges listed at this time are as the following

* *Grand* Douchebaggery (allowing front page posts that clearly conflict with their rules) [(Charge Confirmed)](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1ke4ro/people_to_reddit_vs_the_mods_of_rcringepics/cbo1gmi)

___________________________________________________________
    Evidence

Rule 2 of /r/cringepics cleary state...

&gt; 2) Do not post images of minors (under 18 years old). We were all young and stupid once. Kids being dumb is not cringe-worthy. This is a bannable offense.

This serious sounding rule makes you feel like it's important by its threat of a ban. Yet the mods can allow posts on their front page that clearly demonstrate that they do allow people to break **some** rules.

[This](http://i.imgur.com/Ro0lk5E.png) is a photo from a deleted post made by /u/xUGRxBoogeyMan. The post was listed as *Removed: No Kids*. In a private message he had told the OP that the kid was 16 in the photo. Clearly this is the work of a lazy moderator that didn't bother to finish reading the post and looked straight to a number. Later the moderator had to say this

&gt; Your post was removed because the person in the photo looked underage.

Lets say (in this case) that the boy was underage. Then while searching through their subreddits front page why was /u/Skreamerz able to find [these **Seal of Approval** posts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1jwmym/the_mods_of_this_subreddit_are_banning_people/) As you can also see this post was removed.

SUMMARY STATEMENT

Clearly this is a paid production for the purposes of marketing.  /u/IxKilledxKenny is either TBGyde or closely associated with TBGyde and therefore acting on behalf of @TacoBell social media marketing. 

Because /u/IxKilledxKenny is just trying to make a living in LA I ask that the court instead pass sentence on the primary offender, Taco Bell, a repeat offender, and sanction any measures against the Taco Bell brand on reddit, including automation and brigading.  I further argue Taco Bell is a corporation and therefore may be brigaded without violation of Reddit's rules. 

I therefore formally charge Taco Bell and /u/IxKilledxKenny with Class A Corporate douchebaggery.


*EDIT 2:

I petition the court to indite /u/impatrickt to be tried in the same case, as a representative of Taco Bell / Yum brands, on similar charges:
1) spamming/self-promotion on behalf of Yum brands
2) conspiracy to commit corporate douchebaggery with Taco Bell / Yum brands

/u/impatrickt is also a real account, likely a marketing student at a local college.  He also claims to have no association with the Yum brands social media team (http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/14jr13/taco_bell_song/c7dytde) and yet appears on their facebook page http://i.imgur.com/DA4E7.jpg (nice watch btw).

http://i.imgur.com/duNok.jpg (publicly shared work by /u/impatrickt from program at local college)

Evidence of /u/impatrickt's active promotion on behalf of Yum Brands:

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/12p760/kid_gets_shutdown_by_kfc_fb/
http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/10ynrp/tacos_people/

Edit 3: /u/impatrickt works for an ad agency Grip Limited, who work directly for Yum! brands.  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=jfQUKaoQoJU#!) /u/impatrickt is absolutely, 100%, a paid Taco Bell/Yum brands shill.   He has generated millions of page views and brand impressions, sucked bandwidth, and without generating any real revenue for reddit and degenerating the content overall while maximizing the consumption of unhealthy food.  This is a particularly heinous crime when reddit corp is seeking investors who will maximize it's freedom.

Summary:

This further adds support to charges of corporate douchebaggery by Yum Brands (Taco Bell/Pizza Hut/KFC) through conspiracy with young marketing or video production students that have credible reddit profiles.

* This image, uploaded to imgur (www.imgur.com), is a screenshot of a post made by /u/DeckersDelight at approximately Wednesday, April 3rd, 2013 at 19:26:35 UTC. 

This clearly shows that /u/DeckersDelight has posted a comical image of  a sexual innuendo to /r/baseball (www.reddit.com/r/baseball) at 19:26:35 UTC on April 3rd, 2013. There was no malicious intent in such a photo and the OP received a large amount of ""upvotes"", eventually leading to a #1 spot on /r/baseball and /r/all (www.reddit.com/r/all).

[Piece of Evidence #2](http://i.imgur.com/zU9o30eh.jpg?1)

* This image, uploaded to imgur, is a screenshot of a post made by /u/Wolf55 at approximately Wednesday, April 3rd, 2013 at 19:50:42 UTC. 

This image has now been posted on the subreddit, /r/funny (www.reddit.com/r/funny) and at the point in time of the screencapture taken, has achieved over 592 ""karma"". This post was allegedly made by the defendant, /u/wolf55 but the image itself was taken by his ""friend"". It is impossible for the OP to have posted this original photo unless his friend had given it to him as well, which is entirely possible. This piece of evidence is merely presented to establish a timeframe, one that shows that /u/Wolf55 has posted the exact same photo as /u/DeckersDelight, only close to 25 minutes later. 

[Piece of Evidence #3](http://i.imgur.com/SbpyhhWh.png?1)

*This image was taken in the comment section of the post by the defendant, /u/Wolf55, in /r/funny. The post in question, http://www.np.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1blxik/my_friend_took_this_while_watching_the_white_sox/, is still achieving a large amount of ""upvotes"" and continues to rise on /r/all.

The people of Reddit wish to charge /u/wolf55 with

* One Count of False Accusation of Reposting

* One Count of Being A Lying, Thieving, Cunt

While the defendant claims to be in law enforcement I contest his claim and that he is lying to take advantage of the current reddit hatred towards the police.  Evidence: 

24 days ago the defendant claimed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g3k08/whatwho_do_you_still_secretly_obsess_over_even/cagee3y) just 24 days ago that he had not completed college.  I cannot name a law enforcement position that does not require at least a college degree.  I believe the defendant is a) In college to be a police officer or b) Not a police officer at all as further evidence below shows.

Exhibit B) 1 month ago the defendant claimed to be not a police officer but a farm owner in this post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1f0ff8/illinois_illegally_seizes_bees_resistant_to/ca5nfo5).  If you scroll down through the comments another user calls the defendant a liar for claiming to be a farmer and he defends himself fiercely.

Exhibit C:[3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19w2q5/what_resources_are_available_to_discover/c8rtjji) the defendant claimed they worked somewhere (not mentioned most likely due to the nature of the question asked) and was requesting how to find more information about someone at work he disliked.  Although circumstantial I would note that this is not something a rookie police officer would do in what could only be his first month at work.

Exhibit D: Again circumstantial but the defendants comment history includes many anti government comments including [I treat feds like mushrooms. I feed em shit and keep them in the dark](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1g4bcl/whats_your_alltime_favorite_movie_quote/cagod5z).  

To conclude I charge u/brodimagio on one count of impersonating an officer to exploit the current reddit hatred towards police officers.

The case I am about to present to you is disturbing. It's a sordid tale of sexual self-flattery that will rock the very foundation of this courtroom. Viewer discretion is advised. 

It all started when I met a woman named /u/ilovemybfsp33n  Her classy screen name aside, this upstanding female redditor created quite a stir. She created a thread in /r/AskWomen claiming that she needs help with a bizarre problem. Her boyfriend's penis is simply too wonderful. No. Seriously. That's her problem. The thread is titled, ""*How do you ladies manage a larger-than-average penis in your very average vagina?*"" 

It brings me no pleasure to discuss this foul topic, karma court, but we must! A grave injustice has been committed and we must be vigilant. The grotesque thread continues.

The sex is amazing, she claims. He's just too big! He doesn't fit in her average-sized, totally normal va-jay-jay, and well, sometimes, on the rarest of occasions, it hurts. But she's quick to point out how wonderful he is in bed, despite this. 

Then, guess what happens next? The boyfriend SHOWS UP IN THE COMMENTS! And wouldn't you know it? She immediately identifies him to everyone. He then sits back for the remainder of the thread, enjoying his newfound reputation as cock king while the women of askreddit inquire and discuss their sex life. 

Ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you that this bizarre couple are, in fact, the same person! The same depraved man controls both accounts in what can only be seen as a desperate ploy to convince strangers of his large endowment. [READ THE THREAD FOR YOURSELF AND DECIDE. IT'S ALL THERE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/sa1iq/how_do_you_ladies_manage_a_largerthanaverage/)

**The offending post in question is 9 months old, which exceeds the 21 day statue of limitations as defined by our constitution.** However, my charges of DOUCHEBAGGERY still apply! The user name itself is a continued act of deception and douchebaggery - the screen name is ilovemybfsp33n - in other words, ""I LOVE MY BOYFRIEND's PENIS"" So with every post he makes, pretending to be this female, he continues the deception from 9 months prior. Also, it should be noted - the account holder being charged here is /u/DickBigguns AKA BIG DICK GUNS or something to that effect. The screen names used by this supposed ""couple"" (which is the same guy) are grounds for douchebaggery in and of itself. 

**UPDATE:** /u/dickbigguns attempted to sway the public opinion with a /r/subredditdrama post, WHICH WAS REMOVED BY THE MODERATORS, when they learned that he is in fact, the same person as /u/ilovemybfsp33n It was titled, ""This could become an interesting one. /u/JoelQ wildly accuses Redditor of sock-puppetry and 'cock-king ego padding' after she denies him nudes."" Original link: http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/17nvc3
 
I suggest, with the permission of this court, that he be charged with Felony Self-Promotion and 12 separate charges of general Douchebaggery - I suggest that he be fined 1200 karma! Why? Because that's 100 karma for every inch of false penile claims he made. Thank you.

Submissions: [The Title](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/18q51r/im_getting_desperate_ive_tried_12_different/) in Question

I would like to submit the evidence to the court showing that the [posting history](http://www.reddit.com/user/puntini) does not only show that the poster has not posted in ""twelve different sub-reedits"" but has indeed **not** even attempted to post in **ONE** additional.

The decision to submit FELONY charges was partially influenced on ancillary evidence showing the poster to be a compulsive liar.  Such instances noted by other redditors include:

[–]Sqin 25 points 5 hours ago
No you're not, you're a compulsive liar. I just looked over your submission history, you said you live five minutes from your school. You also claimed to be a brother in America's first all male quintuplet and posted a photo of your 'brothers' and 'you', yet about three submissions earlier you posted a photo of yourself and you are neither of those five people.

And also:

[–]hashbrownies 4 points 3 hours ago
Another bit of bs out of him.
[–]puntini[S] -29 points 2 months ago Middleschooler? I am in college visiting my mom for the holidays and I recently went to a sports store and saw a rifle I wanted and I had to run it by my mom (because I'm good like that) before I bought the gun.
So 2 months ago he's in college and now he's a home schooled and in high school. YUP.

**EDIT**
The ruling has been passed down:

**[–]cameronbates1 4 points 7 hours ago
My decision is made. Puntini is sentenced to 6 months of redditing on hard mode. This means he has to down vote every post he makes for the next 6 months. Puntini is also required to browse r/cringe and watch/look at everything completly for 6 months. Case closed, Court dismissed.**

The offending post: http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1imstw/fitness_app_that_provides_real_personal_trainers/. Take a second, read the incriminating thread, and compose your first impressions. Now for the dive.

21 hours ago, the company TruTrainer, estab. 04/07/2013 (http://imgur.com/hFZKhg8), posted in the subreddit /r/startups under the alias /u/jackman123, to promote its new app, ""TruTrainer"". Ladies and gentleman of the jury, I present exhibits A and B:

Exhibit A: http://imgur.com/T0g0Fmi
u/jackman123, estab. 23 hours ago, begins a coordinated campaign between 4 subreddits, to promote the app ""TruFitness""; including two posts to /r/startups about the same company.

Exhibit B: http://imgur.com/qYGtMFN
u/jackman123 admits to the ownership of the company.




HOWEVER, this is not against the ethics of the subreddit /r/startups. In fact, it is encouraged from entrepreneurs to ""show /r/"" their creations. The AGGREVATION lies with the creation of /u/liontamerNYC and subsequent posts. Ladies and gentleman of the comments, I present exhibits 1, C, and D.

Exhibit 1: http://imgur.com/jIPnFJq
/u/liontamerNYC, created 12 hours ago, has posted three times. The three posts happen to be on the two ""TruTrainer"" posts. All three posts are extremely defensive of the ""TruTrainer"" app, almost aggressively so.

Exhibit C: http://imgur.com/SnDYdlA
Clearly, /u/liontamerNYC claims that he/she ""doesn't work for TruTrainer"", yet ""saw this post on their social media"". I would like to also submit files C1 and C2:

Addendum C1: http://imgur.com/i1Kq10u
A screenshot of TruTrainer's facebook presence: 0 likes 0 talking about.

Addendum C2: http://imgur.com/dQ9YsYd
While TruTrainer has 68 twitter followers, not one tweet linked to the reddit post, most simply spammed the promotion.

Therefore it is impossible for /u/liontamerNYC to have saw this post on ""TruTrainer's"" social media, and thus /u/liontamerNYC appears to work for ""TruTrainer"" . I also present exhibit D: http://imgur.com/9hj4KZV further showing /u/liontamerNYC's TruTrainer connection. 

This blatant double-creation of accounts alone is enough to CHARGE the MODS OF /R/STARTUPS with 1. INABILITY TO FILTER SPAM and 2. INCOMPETENT MODERATION. However the rabbit hole spirals deeper.

UPON further inspection, /u/whenyourreadyc's initial post: http://imgur.com/cAsOLvT seems uncharacteristically out of sync with /r/startups culture: ""narcissistic liberal arts graduate"" ""corporate jargon 101"" and ""you should target it to fat women who need the extra gym instruction/confidence boost."". This itself is not worthy of such an accusation though. For this, I'd like to present exhibit E: http://imgur.com/bi1u7gA.

/u/whenyourreadyc was created 1 day ago, has 4 total posts, two in the post http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1imstw/fitness_app_that_provides_real_personal_trainers/ and two in the post linking to: http://www.togetherfull.com/. I leave the jury to deliberate whether /u/whenyourreadyc was created for any purpose OTHER than to deride ""TruTrainer"", and be the anti-hero to /u/liontamerNYC

Thus I also charge TRUTRAINER APP with GROSS NEGLIGENCE with regards to GUERILLA MARKETING, as well as the MODS OF /R/STARTUPS with a second count of INCOMPETENT MODERATION.




Ladies and gentlemen of the comments, there should exist no doubt that TRUTRAINER APPS established /u/jackman123 23 hours ago with the intent to spam the promotion of TRUTRAINER. TRUTRAINER APPS then went on to create two dummy accounts, /u/liontamerNYC and /u/whenyourreadyc, to get in an argument within the post and misdirect the public of /r/startups.  Thus, the MODS of /R/STARTUPS FAILED IN THEIR DUTY TO PROPERLY FILTER THE FRONT PAGE OF SPAM.

**Current post count:** 2,359

**Charges:** Bullshit and karmawhoring

**Reasons for skepticism:**

1.. Accused by possible real world friend:

&gt; ""[I don't know how to prove it unless OP decides to reply to me, but he's a friend of mine and wrote this for 12th grade English.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1emwt7/one_of_my_sixth_grade_students_wrote_this/ca1u0y5)"" 

Note: This is accusation is followed up when the accuser posts an original picture featuring a mutual friend on facebook, who the accused previously made a reddit post featuring a picture of. 

2.. Post history unlike that of what one would expect of a school teacher.

&gt; [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/q600r/ignorant_teacher_rage/) are [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/j8s5v/not_sure_what_to_think_true_story/) separate submissions from OP suggesting that he is still in highschool. I believe you

&gt; Not to mention that his entire post history is about TF2, Dota 2, Pokemon, and arguing about Legend of Zelda with his friends. I highly doubt he is an elementary school teacher.

3.. An arguably too advanced vocabulary and ability for an 11/12 year old. 

&gt; [as a teacher, i've read a large amount of middle school writing. even at best, none has ever neared this piece - i call bullshit, and should i be proven wrong, i'll then rejoice. this was not solely the work of a sixth grade student.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1emwt7/one_of_my_sixth_grade_students_wrote_this/ca1um5r)

The charges?

*Consistent lying*

As you can see by these posts made by /u/-jimmyjack- here:

[Jimmy saves a dog from being shot.](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/vbq8b/i_saved_coby_from_being_shot_yesterday_she_is_all/)

[Jimmy loses his best friend Buddy.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/wuosg/today_my_little_guy_lost_his_battle_to_cancer_rip/) Users quickly accuse him of lying, he then deletes the post. You can see the deleted comments by looking at his comment history.

[Here Jimmy is working as a barista.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/xhmrv/i_am_a_barista_i_know_its_basic_but_any_love_for/)

[Jimmy is now in the ""defense force"".](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/zyoyq/insurgents_posing_as_us_troops_attacked_an_air/c699zha?context=3)

[Jimmy with his 16 year old girlfriend, aww!](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/13cnyz/today_my_girlfriend_became_my_girlfrent/) In the comments Jimmy states that he is 18 and she is 16.

[Jimmy's pot gets laced with meth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12ymvu/guys_help_someone_laced_my_shit_what_do_i_do/)

[He sure does have a lot of weed for an 18 year old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/12q387/my_dealer_heard_i_was_low_on_money_and_have_me/)

[So this is Jimmy too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/129ri4/this_one_is_for_you_ents_this_will_be_a_good_week/)

[weed......](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/13v53e/so_i_gave_my_dealer_50_for_an_18_this_is_what_i/) In this thread Jimmy says he was a dealer for 2 years, but he's still only 18?!

[A heartwarming stor- nah i'm just kidding, more weed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/ycshj/my_smoke_spot_today/) Notice in this post he stated that he is a mechanic and that it is hard for him to remove dirt from his nails.

Judging by his numerous posts it is easy to tell that Jimmy sure does have multiple odd occupations ranging from being a barista to being part of a defense force.You also see that Jimmy really likes to smoke weed and beg for karma on /r/trees by commenting on users posts saying things like ""uptoke"" or ""happy toking friENT"".

From the two times Jimmy has posted a picture of himself you see that they don't look alike! How odd is that? And how is it that jimmy gets all this amazing weed at the age of 18 when he should be busy in the defense force, cafe, and auto shop?

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury these posts are simply too random to be labeled as true and /u/-jimmyjack- is a liar and a karmawhore.

As reddit goes this sight is entirely anonymous, however your reputation is based on your comment history, based on the your comment history, there was in my belief a real case that you were indeed someone looking for attention. However I will go on record that all i was looking for was the **truth,** which is why i asked for a time period for the you to come and provide evidence on on your behalf to exonerate yourself. I /u/vapormaverick wish you good travels and do not give you false sympathy, you are actually someone I actually admire as you are rising against adversity and are truly doing something epic despite your diagnosis.

) that seemed harmless, and clicked it, expecting to be giggling at the morally questionable antics that constantly flow from the 4chan image boards. Instead, my friends, I became a victim, for thev in the third photo in the album was none other than a major spoiler for Bioshock Infinite. This was a game I had been working hard not to spoil for myself. A game I was planning on renting for my birthday, the very next day (May 3rd).

 I shocked that my great effort to preserve the ending (weeks and weeks of shutting myself away from any talk of the game) was ruined. There was no spoiler tag or any indication there would be a spoiler involved. I would normally see this as a mistake, but in a comment ([Exhibit B](http://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/1dk0us/anon_wants_to_be_entertained/c9rb8i2)), /u/M0T0RB04T showed no remorse.

Around 8 A.M. EST, /u/MVthick86 posted a picture of a quilt that he claims was made out of old band/concert shirts by his mother and aunt. However [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/lzdoz/my_mom_and_aunt_made_a_quilt_of_all_my_old/) by /u/timconnery was made over a year ago.

As for the forgery, [this](http://i.imgur.com/TLssE.jpg) is the original photo from /u/timconnery's post in /r/pic a year ago. [This](http://i.imgur.com/T8KZR.jpg) is the photo used in the accused's post. Note that the url of each picture is different. /u/MVthick86 stole the picture and claimed it as OC and is not even giving /u/timconnery the views on imgur that it would have received from his blatant repost.

Therefore, I have no other choice but to add on the additional count of massive fagetry, since the accused is obviously a faget.

OP didn't ""see this kid."" OP either **is** this kid or one of his parents, but probably the kid himself since he [said](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ameristralia/comments/1inysd/my_response_to_the_recent_british_heat_wave/cb6fck4?context=3) you run cross country.

There's no reason otherwise that OP should have: 1) his [e-mail address](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jpb2o/so_i_was_walking_at_a_market_when_i_saw_this_kid/cbgyxj0), 2) full pricing range, 3) summer plans, and 4) place of residence (Arizona) if you don't really know him.

Further, OP himself lives in Arizona, as this kid does: again, here's your [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ameristralia/comments/1inysd/my_response_to_the_recent_british_heat_wave/cb6fck4?context=3), in case you delete it:

&gt;I live in Arizona. Last week we had a record 120 degrees! (I run cross country in it...).

Additionally, OP [said](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jpb2o/so_i_was_walking_at_a_market_when_i_saw_this_kid/cbgy22h) this kid took 30 minutes to make a custom engraving. But then he [said](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1jpb2o/so_i_was_walking_at_a_market_when_i_saw_this_kid/cbgzmlu) it was too cloudy to burn yesterday! This is absolute proof that he is/knows the kid. Why and how else would he be able to watch him make an engraving, and still be able to know it was too cloudy to burn yesterday?

Call me skeptical, but I doubt there are many people from Arizona visiting small Salt Spring Island in British Columbia; much less Arizonan tourists in small Salt Springs who would see each other at a market.

Anyways, recently r/AdviceAnimals has had the posts getting flair tags, that do not actually categorize the post or add to the discussion of the post. They are just simple comments that could just be submitted AS comments, as opposed to flairs.

These flairs also bring a whole mod-induced circlejerk into the subreddit, with ""So Brave"" flairs on the posts about the Boston Marathon tragedy (which I believe just adds insult to injury).

Any post on r/AdviceAnimals about this incident is being attacked by the mods, and the mods are also making circlejerk remarks to the commenters of these posts ([example](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1chapi/dear_mods_of_radviceanimals/c9gjh8l?context=3)).

Furthermore, a banner at the top of r/AdviceAnimals reads ""Grab your pitchfork, the adviceanimals flair debate needs you"" which links to the post above and further insults the users of r/AdviceAnimals.

EDIT: Currently r/AdviceAnimals has a new banner, ""Upset about the flair?"" which now leads to a Joker meme.

----

**The case against /u/Meesher**

*Charges being tried for:*

* False Advertisement - Felony - Defined as: When the accused posts a link with an intentionally misleading title.

*Background:*

/u/Meesher claims in his post title that the LICKETYPOP toy found was found in a [Toys 'R Us in Singapore](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/17t2d7/this_was_in_toysrus/c88wi52).

This is flat out wrong.

*Evidence:*

1. Toys 'R Us Labels look like this  - [[Photo Proof]](http://www.worldsgreatesttoys.com/wgtBlog/category/blog-series/price-stickers/toys-r-us/)

2. The labels in the post say 'KIITOS' and look nothing like the Toys 'R Us label. - [[Photo Proof]](http://i.imgur.com/AlRnqD5.png)

3. 'KIITOS' is a store in a Singapore mall that has lifestyle gifts and home accesories - [[Website Proof 1]](http://kiitoslifestyleshop.blogspot.com/) - [[Website Proof 2]](http://www.marinasquare.com.sg/directory/tenant/kiitos) - [[Website Proof 3]](https://www.facebook.com/kiitos.sg)

4. The company that makes the LICKETYPOPS is Fred, as listed on the box and their website. - [[Photo Proof]](http://i.imgur.com/SgDx5o9.jpg) - [[Website Proof]](http://fredandfriends.com/products/view/lickety-pop-freezer-pops)

5. Fred does not list on their website that Toys 'R Us is a retailer anywhere, and lists no places in Singapore to buy their products. - [[Website Proof 1]](http://fredandfriends.com/buy/store-locator) - [[Website Proof 2]](http://fredandfriends.com/buy/featured-etailers)

6. Toys 'R Us Singapore website does not list Fred as a brand (click the dropdown brand list), nor does it show LICKETYPOPS as an available product. - [[Website Proof]](http://www.toysrus.com.sg/toysrus/specialoffer/jsp/newSGListProduct.jsp?keyword=LICKETYPOPS&amp;action=KeywordSearch&amp;lang=en)

7. On the official KIITOS blog they list Fred products as avaliable - [[Website Proof]](http://kiitoslifestyleshop.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2013-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;updated-max=2014-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;max-results=1)

9. Toys 'R US Singapore's website allows for searching their product index by a products SKN (Stock Keeping Number). To prove this you can just search for an SKN for example 124192 which [yields this search](http://www.toysrus.com.sg/toysrus/specialoffer/jsp/newSGListProduct.jsp?action=KeywordSearch&amp;lang=en&amp;keyword=124192) (You can see the search keyword in the URL). The SKN in the original post by /u/Meesher is [A023](http://i.imgur.com/LYqSuCf.jpg). So, in theory, searching A023 on Toys 'R Us Singapore's website would show the LICKETYPOPS, [but it does not list them](http://www.toysrus.com.sg/toysrus/specialoffer/jsp/newSGListProduct.jsp?keyword=A023&amp;action=KeywordSearch&amp;lang=en).

10. I messaged the official Facebook page for Toys R Us Singapore, look what they said. - [Photo](http://i.imgur.com/O5BVkPg.png)

*Summary:*

The LICKETYPOPS were at the KIITOS store in Singapore, not Toys 'R Us. /u/Meesher should be convicted of False Advertisement.

----

**The case against /u/Kraazyy**

*Charges being tried for:*

* Time-Wasting - Misdemeanor - When a Redditor brings a frivolous lawsuit or files frivolous charges.

* Defamation, first degree - Misdemeanor

*Background:*

/u/Kraazyy prosecuted me for making a frivolous case with a weak backing thus wanting to charge me for time-wasting. He also accused me of enabling public defamation of /u/Meesher when it is undeserved. However my case is not frivilous, nor a waste of time. If /u/Meesher is found to be guilty then I firmy believe that /u/Kraazyy ought to be found guilty of time-wasting.

/u/Kraazyy should also be tried on charges of defamation of the first degree. Two of the sentances listed in the constitution are denouncement through comment, and denouncement through private message. I was publicy denounced in the comments by /u/Kraazyy and also send a PM claiming I had been 'served.'

*Evidence:*

1. /u/Kraazyy's original post - [[Permalink Comment]](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/17utya/umeesher_v_ukode47/)

2. /u/Kraazyy calling a downvote brigade against me as punishment, this also proves public defamation - [[Permalink Comment]](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/17utya/umeesher_v_ukode47/c894ucb)

3. /u/Kraazyy sending me a PM and further public defamation and denouncement - [[Permalink Comment]](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/17utya/umeesher_v_ukode47/c897s97)

*Summary:*

/u/Kraazyy made a frivolous case that wastes time and tainted my reputation much like he claims I did for /u/Meesher.

/u/Kraazyy sent me a PM and publicly denounced me.

----

**Punishments:**

I do not know what punishments are necessary, I do not believe in downvote brigades personally, but I do think people need to be recognized for committing the crimes they did.

Essentially I just want people to recognize /u/Meesher lied and I did nothing wrong.

Thank you, your honor.

**Edits:**

1. I have added more evidence against /u/Meesher and fixed the links to make them easier to read.

2. I have added 100% evidence that /u/Meesher lied about Toys R Us.

EXHIBIT A:   http://i.imgur.com/30WCkNo.gif

Yesterday, 6/2/13, /u/Mega_Toast submitted this .gif to /r/funny at around 2200 hours. Immediately afterwards, he re-submitted the post with the same title, to /r/gifs (http://i.imgur.com/30WCkNo.gif). 

In both of these threads you can find a fair amount of drama, name calling, and basically everyone claiming this to be a repost. For the most part in this case though, most people brushed it aside saying, ""Well, I've never seen it before..."" as so forth. So far, at this point. OP has yet to do anything *too* terribly wrong.

This brings me to,

EXHIBIT B: http://i.imgur.com/yAe4dOU.jpg

Most likely, this is the most important image. This image was unable to be successful like the previous, due mainly to mass downvoting from those whose suspicions were aroused by Mega_Toast's previous post.

Most of the serious drama takes place in this thread.

And here: http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1fi12k/she_was_waiting_in_line_for_five_minutes/caagxkw

Somewhere deep in that negative karma comment train, you will find /u/Mega_Toast, claiming that he took this picture himself. Even when he was obviously proved to be a liar. He even claimed that he can prove this picture to be his, yet he has yet to prove this proof.

Each and everyone of these are blatant reposts, yet Mega_Toast continually denies the obvious. It seems, actually, that s/he went so far as to actually, rehost, each of these images in Imgur.

Well... that's all I have for now. This guy seems to be potentially very dangerous. He seems like the kind of guy who may continue to repost things for now good reason, deny that they are reposts, and continue to do it as long as he physically can.

I hope you, the people of /r/KarmaCourt, can bring him/her to justice.

Ladies and gentlemen of the court, My head is hung low in sadness, and only you can lift my spirit. For yesterday, my time, on April the 22nd (The Day The Karma Died) a blind and hysterical hissy-fit attack was perpetrated on the person of the redditor known as /u/SatanMD. The accusations did fly, the names did get called, the asshattery nearly collapsed under it´s own gravitational field. That group did attack, aggressively, that user, and of course without the slightest attempt at seeing if they were right, or plausible, or even slightly on track. Let it be known tht the person under attack did not respond to these actions, and merely ignored them. 
  
AND SO I now request justice be served. Mouse-toting possies short-circuit society in their fathful ignorance and consequence-free violence, deeming themselves above and to the side of the laws of decency, and the laws of law, and this particular collection of misfits not only show no remorse, no recognition of the outcome of their actions, no recognition of the wrong they did wraught, but they did continue to downvote throughout the trial, and one juror tried to pretend not to see the proof.  
  
Frankly they all suck the puss off of a dead dingos bollocks.  
  
They had better clean their nails and let their mummies wipe the corners of their mouths with spit-shine, because they are about to be presented to the world in a light they had not reckoned with.  
  
This one will need a judge, a clerk too, and a bucket. I will present my prosecution on summons of the judge. This is just an intro.
  
### Evidence ###  
  
The thread of the crime is [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1cufkl/man_climbed_into_toilet_at_a_festival_im_security/)  
  
The subsequent case in Karmacourt is [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cuoga/the_people_of_rwtf_vs_usatanmd_for_one_charge_of/)  
  
The successful and oh-so-clear case for the defense is [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cuoga/the_people_of_rwtf_vs_usatanmd_for_one_charge_of/c9kjw80) including irrefutable proof of veracity for my then client  
  
The verdict was simple, and said NOT GUILTY of any charges. This is because PROOF WAS PROVIDED of how wrong the lynchy little crappers were. The judge added a scathing attack on the vile ruffians who commited this kneejerk act of moronity, and was moved (almost in tears) to make an unreserved and public apology on behalf of reddit and the free world. This can be seen [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cuoga/the_people_of_rwtf_vs_usatanmd_for_one_charge_of/c9kkry0)
  
#### CONSEQUENCES ####  
  
- to the victim, several hundred downvotes, proper nasty pms from the anonymous heroics of poor judgement, report abuse with resultant posting restrictions because the gutless attack brigade did click the spam button until it's udders did squeak, and a tarnished reputation that some still blind spotty shitheads with their fingers in their ears and there eyes shut still seem hell-bent on ruining, despite the facts and judgement presented in court. Let it be known the victim of these crimes is a pretty cool customer. Others would have spoken to admins about this.
  
- to the accused of this case: no consequences. They are free to lose it again any time they like, and shit on the next innocent partie's slippers without a worry in the world. They also garnished some upvotes of their own as they admired each others baby-tantrum styles.

In another post, he says that he is 13 years old, and wants to know if working out could harm his body. There is no choice but for you to find /u/UlyssesTheSloth guilty of douchebaggery.

___________________________________________________________

EXHIBIT A: [The thread where the defendant claims to have beat up with brother with the help of squatting 260 lbs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/1cz153/fight_with_a_hamplanet_over_healthy_body_weigh/)

EXHIBIT B: [The defendant's post where he claims to be 13 and asks if working out would be good for him.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1csjba/weight_lifting_at_a_young_age/)

___________________________________________________________

MY CLOSING ARGUEMENT: 

In his comment on /r/fitness he says he wants to start weightlifting, and I find it highly unlikely that a 13 year old could squat 260 pounds, especially within 2 days of beginning a weightlifting regimen (as his post in /r/fitness claims).

The prosecution rests.

**/u/TheIllogicalSandwich as Prosecutor (/u/diggi91 not present)**

**/u/Conqueror as Judge**

I represent the good people of Reddit when accusing /u/Duhoo of multiple counts of reposting and simple douchebaggery.

In the month of April and may /r/Funny was suddenly flooded by posts of old simpson jokes. Multiple of these posts turned out to come from /u/Duhoo.

After some backround checking and research more posts were discovered being stolen and reposted.

Most of these examples were of jokes from cartoon TV-shows such as The Simpsons, Family guy and Futurama. The accused does also reposts jokes from other TV-shows, like the popular show ""Community"".

/u/Duhoo scavange the seperate subreddits for this type of content and simply repost it in /r/funny for some easy gained but not earned karma. Latest Example is a post from /r/Futurama:

**Original:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/1f3d3f/why_i_love_futurama/

**/u/Duhoo's repost:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1f4u9h/tell_her_she_looks_thin/

**An example of a post stolen from /r/TheSimpsons:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/simpsonsdidit/comments/1by09r/the_hangover_nah_the_simpsons_did_that_too/

**/u/Duhoo's repost**:

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1eowy8/hangover_simpsons_did_it/

Simply running his posting history through karmadecay shows that he saves jokes from TV-shows that other people post and reposts them a few months or even days later with a similar or the same title. He's been greedy recently and repost things that aren't even a day old.

Examples:

http://karmadecay.com/r/funny/comments/1ednsx/this_is_rare/

This list consists only of posts by /u/Duhoo that are less than a month old. The accused however has been a reposter for much longer than that.

I wish for a punishment to be carried out if the court agrees and the jury deems it fit.

The Bingo board for the Xbox One reveal didn't have 4k support. It's obvious that a system that's in market for the next 6-8 years should support TV's that will start shipping this year. So [I simply commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1eq6o4/bingo_boards_for_the_xbox_reveal_tomorrow/ca2ut0v) ""Needs 4k support"". It got downvoted lightly. Fine. Someone commented it won't happen. I thought I'd put my money where my mouth is and asked if they wanted to bet Reddit Gold on it. 

 Then [the defendant laughed and challenged](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1eq6o4/bingo_boards_for_the_xbox_reveal_tomorrow/ca2y9nm) ""I'll bet you a year's worth. Happily.""

After the launch event, where a CVP announced 4k support, I asked the defendant to make good on their contract. The defendant tried to claim it wasn't powerful enough for 4k games. I didn't say games, I said ""support"", but it does support 4k games. He tacitly admits it supports 4k, but then says ""I sincerely doubt there'll be anything that achieves 4k."" 

He claims the Xbox One doesn't even have the specs to run BF3 at 4k. Here's an article with [BF3 running in 4k on available common hardware today.](http://www.brightsideofnews.com/news/2012/6/18/the-4k-graphics-card-shootout.aspx) Not even next-gen [""rocket science level""](http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/new-kinect-is-rocket-science-level-stuff-says-microsoft-1151803) hardware built specifically for 4k gaming.

**Closing Arguments**

I believe this case is clear and that not only is the defendant dishonest and twisting reality any way he can to undo the mistakes of his arrogance, but is guilty of willful breach of written contract.

To be clear, I don't want a year of Reddit gold. I would be content if the defendant would just admit he got that one wrong. That's all. How often do people admit they were wrong online? You almost never see it. People would rather veer off into dishonesty rather than admit when they are wrong. That needs to change.

**Verdict:**

/u/preggit was found [probably innocent](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1fev4k/the_people_of_reddit_vs_upreggit_for_karma/ca9tlw5) because of lack of compelling evidence.

However, and this is my interpretation of the judgment, preggit was not found not guilty to the charges raised against him. I'll ---stalk--- closely monitor the activity of preggit for the next couple of days to come and will raise a new case against him with lots of damning proof that even he will find difficult to defend against.

 It is in my opinion that the court charges /u/poopy_wizard132 with GrandTheft.jpg. As for sentencing, it is in  my belief that marking him for downvote accross multiple networks be the only appropriate punishment, as one glance at his link-karma will show something shocking: he has well over 46,000 link karma and has deleted almost every single post giving him karma. If we base how he has gotten that karma from his current posts, the one in question and another one, which I have proof of it's lack of OC [here](http://karmadecay.com/i.imgur.com/U275k.jpg), then we can surmise that /u/poopy_wizard132 re-posts OC for his massive hoard of link Karma.

I ran into one /u/davidborts in **[this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1i1408/the_reaction_when_american_girls_hear_my_accent/)**. I came to assert my point that men and women tend to be physically attracted to people with foreign accents (including accents originating from different parts of ones home nation)... when I started to read the comments. Many fellow Redditors pointed out how he often changes the nationality in order to gain Karma. I did my own investigating and found this evidence. 

I suspect /u/davidborts is European, as many of his post are pro anglo... mostly to the point where its racist.

I have seen many cases where the prosecution, judges, jury and even the defense were completely ruining the experience of KarmaCourt and not knowing the rules and constitution properly. I'm not going to point fingers or anything but it should be addressed by the admins of this subreddit. 

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/16llka/a_call_for_decorum/) brought it up to me and I agree with everything that is being said in that post. 

It is in my opinion that Judges should be the mods of this subreddit or at least approved by the mods to be a judge in the KarmaCourt. There are many people that come into a case and say they will judge this case then are rash to apply a ruling before each side has rested its case.  A Judge should be acting on the will of the jurors (If Present).

Judges also need to be a little bit more controlling of the case. I have noticed many times the prosecution/defense will be actually attacking one another and shying away from the case entirely.

Saying that, Jurors need to hear both sides of the case. So many times I have been defending a case and I will go AFK for the night and wake up to find the case has been decided before the defense/prosecution has rested their case. 

Prosecution/Defense lawyers must be acknowledged by the defendant/plaintiff as their representation then acknowledged by the judge. So many times, people from other firms or just random observers will jump in and give their two cents about the case which throws off the flow of things, at least in my eyes.

And to the observers. What happened to the ""Innocent until proven guilty"" that is the backbone to any court system. I would say 90% of the cases on here the accused is guilty before the defendant/defense has pointed out their case. This included the judges and jury.

I'm not asking for an amendment of the constitution because this is *not really* constitution stuff. It would be more, general rules of the court and I feel that someone, in every case weather it be a bailiff or the judge. Should be enforcing order in the court. 

**TL;DR: This courts gets out of order alot and lacks enforcement in its own laws.**

I got bored, pulled out my smart phone, and browsed /r/KarmaCourt for a while, only to discover that /u/Stabulosity, one of the accused in this case, had served as judge on a case brought against the plaintiff of this case by *one of the defendants of the case*. In [his presidings](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1dinbe/i_bleekicker_of_the_gazette_narwhal_law_and_of/c9qoddr) he neglected to follow Article II Section A Subsection 5 of the KarmaCourt Constitution, and not only began the case without summoning the defendant, decided a verdict in absentia. This is a clear abuse of Mod powers, as he was speaking as a mod when he took the case.  
Furthermore, it is obvious that /u/Stabulosity took the actions he took to silence the prosecution on the original case I was sitting so patiently for (do you know how many hours I had been there just staring?)  
When I mentioned this to him, in the form of [an objection](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1dinbe/i_bleekicker_of_the_gazette_narwhal_law_and_of/c9qphlq), he proceeded to insult me and call me a cat. This is highly offensive to my sticky walls, which have always looked far more like a goat than a cat.

I bring these charges before the court partially because I am severely bored, and partially because I was directly asked by a Justice of the KC to do so.

3.) Both posts comprised of images of or related to products. 

AS AND FOR THE FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

4.) That defendant posted above referenced links knowingly with products located in them.

5.) That defendant posted the above referenced links with no connection to the actual making content. 

6.) That defendant posted the above referenced links purposefully and solely as an advertisment for above referenced products as a means of ""astro-turfing"" 

7.) That defendant posted the above referenced links purposefully to defraud the subreddit community into believing the content was [OC]

8.) That defendant, posting above referenced product, denied the reddit community and subreddit users at large, meaningful content and any /u/s opportunity to gain karma. 

9.) As of 3/28/13, defendant has failed to remove the above referenced links, thereby causing harm and damage to plaintiffs. 

10.) Plaintiff is entitled to the removal of this post, and apology to the community as a whole for fraud and intentional product placement in a subreddit, known as CORPORATESHILLPOSER.exe.

Therefore, plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant, as recited in the complaint, together with interest, costs, and disbursement of this action.

Claiming that he had been a first responder to 9/11, being a SWAT member for 8 years and has died twice from heart attacks caused by the debris that he inhaled when he was ""cleaning up and saving people"".  

Now why is this not true you might ask?  
Allow me to bring in my proof!  

**Proof #1:** His proof was not good enough and could have been taken from the internet or could have been a picture of a random man standing in the debris! Also the 2 men look nothing alike!

**Proof #4** The final proof! [Here OP states that it is his dad answering on his account.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/19kzu5/i_am_a_first_responder_to_911_14_years_as_a/c8p5sb8) But wait! What was that? Wasn't his dad in Port Authority? And then suddenly he is a cop? SWAT even?  
This was the final answer he made. Was he afraid of us finding out what was going on? Perhaps... All i know is that i want this guy brought to justice!

This was my final proof honored people of /r/KarmaCourt!  
I would say that should be enough.  
Since this is my first time in court i hope i am doing this right.  

Thank you!  

Edit: Okay. Looked through the AMA again. It states that ""his dad"" was a cop for 14 years and SWAT member for 8. Since 2001 where he was in Port Authority...

Yesterday, in /r/drunk, /r/eatsandwiches, and /r/shittyfoodporn, /u/ashleyska posted the same image 3 times, netting over 1500 karma at the time I write this. The image was of an... unconventional sandwich with macaroni, hot dogs, and other things in it. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem (especially if she had noted that they were x-posts). The problem is that the posts on /r/eatsandwiches and /r/shittyfoodporn were both titled ""My drunken masterpiece"". This clearly implies that /u/ashleyska invented, or at least made the sandwich herself, but as discovered by /u/discretion in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/eatsandwiches/comments/1cynze/my_drunken_masterpiece/c9lm1ku), the sandwich was obviously bought at a restaurant or take-out place and brought home: The flyer for a restaurant serving the sandwich is visible in the background of the picture, as is the tin foil they wrap it in.

I thank the court for its time.

Redditor /u/tates528 has falsely claimed this picture and the cat to be his, while also claiming to have constructed the tank in the picture. He also uploaded a picture that has been photoshopped with the logo of a video game, which was done without consent from the OP.

&gt;Uh, OP, are you marrying two separate people? Because this post you made two days ago makes it certainly seem so. OP is a fag, etc.

**The Evidence**

I then took it upon myself to research his three most recent posts. His most recent, about [becoming a citizen of the US](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1dtbhk/i_became_murican_today_please_ignore_the_hairline/), has a picture taken from [this site](http://thewheatleychronicle.blogspot.com/2011/05/dual-citizenship-are-two-passports.html).

His two engagement posts, both with conflicting stories, feature pictures of rings found on various places on the internet.

The [first](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1dpidv/we_started_as_best_friends_when_we_were_6_the/) can be found [here](http://www.whiteflash.com/about-diamonds/tips-and-advice/owning-an-engagement-ring-in-houston--the-complete-manual-916.htm), among other places.

&gt;25 days ago he signed a post ""a fan from finland[1] "". The username is a phonetic version of Cuica which is a brazilian instrument, the one that makes the owl like hooting noise typical to samba. 

**I would like to formally charge /u/kuikka3 with karma whoring and general douchebaggery.**

/u/Synister90, first degree karmawhoring. That /u/Synister90 did knowingly fabricate an image macro claiming to be emotionally moved over a situation meriting support, in the sole interest of receiving supportive upvotes.

## The events:

Yesterday, /u/Synister90 submitted [a Success Kid image](http://i.imgur.com/zInpy5T.jpg) to /u/AdviceAnimals with no content, comedic or otherwise, beyond claiming that the submitter was tearfully proud of his son, who ""just beat cancer for the second time"". In addition, /u/Synister90 adds in the title of the post that the purported child with cancer is twelve years old.

The post then came to gather 8,284 upvotes (count at time of proceedings).

## The evidence:

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, /u/Ulyaman will now present [Exhibit A](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1d7pzb/hes_twelve/): an AMA started by /u/Synister90 two weeks ago [(now deleted)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cb1ab/iama_22_yo_guy_that_did_so_many_drugs_at_one/), in which /u/Synister90 claims to be 22 years old and a massive drug user.

## Prosecution's argument

- The claim that /u/Synister90 makes in his AMA that he is 22 years old is bolstered by the '90' at the end of his username, which suggests that he was born in 1990 (22 years ago).
- If all of the claims /u/Synister90 has made are true, it would mean that /u/Synister90 would have to have fathered his child, twelve years ago, when /u/Synister90 was just 10 years of age (or is otherwise raising a child who is only ten years younger than himself).
- Other users have pointed out that cancer patients do not usually consider remission to mean that a cancer has been ""beaten"", and especially don't consider it beaten a ""second time"".
- Rather than addressing these facts, when the AMA was revealed, /u/Synister90 deleted its content, suggesting that he was trying to cover his tracks.

The prosecution asserts that /u/Synister90 is karmawhoring, using an image that may or may not have even been original content, using the title to add an additionally emotionally manipulative claim for increased sympathy.",,False,,t5_2v788,1367186731.0,,,True,t3_1dal28,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1dal28/the_people_of_reddit_vs_usynister90_for/,

Wait, nevermind. Wrong case. Give me a few seconds...

Ah, here it is. The defendant in this case is [_Snuffles](http://www.reddit.com/user/_Snuffles), who is on trial for the charges of comment theft and karma whoring.  The evidence presented against him is as follows:

* At 8:35 GMT on October 17, user [Narcosist](http://www.reddit.com/user/Narcosist) makes [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11me12/getting_real_sick_of_this_shit_microsoft/c6nqe68) post in /r/gaming .

* At 11:23 GMT on the same day, user [Iamtypingwithonehand](http://www.reddit.com/user/IamTypingWithOneHand) makes [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11me12/getting_real_sick_of_this_shit_microsoft/c6nqe68) post in the comment section of Narcosist's post. Doing so was perfectly acceptable, as it was relevant to the topic and was not submitted as a link, thusly barring karma profits. For his contribution, he recieves 800+ upvotes.

* Now to the case. At 12:28 GMT, over 1 hour after Typing's post, [_Snuffles](http://www.reddit.com/user/_Snuffles) makes [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mkck/getting_real_sick_of_this_shit_microsoft_next/) post, also in /r/gaming. After several hours of image analysis, it has been concluded by a team of highly trained professionals that Snuffles's post is an exact copy of Narco's, only resized and with Typing's post added to the bottom.

* As put eloquently by [tha_dood](http://www.reddit.com/user/tha_dood) in his [response](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/11mkck/getting_real_sick_of_this_shit_microsoft_next/c6nu1q6), ""HOLY FUCK I LOVE IT WHEN YOU TAKE A TOP COMMENT FROM ANOTHER POST AND ADD IT TO THE ORIGINAL POST AND THEN REPOST IT."" This appears to be the general attitude of the comment section, however the post still received +1300 upvotes, therefore the clear case of theft has grown into one of evidenced karma-whoring. 

I leave you with that, and we shall arrive at a fair, unbiased conclusion after all evidence has been analyzed and both parties have called forth witnesses and gathered testimonies. 

Also, this is a new court room, so the pitchforks are located on the left  side of all exits, rather than the right side.

HOWEVER, thanks to the great [detective work](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jw6r2/fathers_of_reddit_whats_your_greatest_dont_tell/cbj647y) of /u/ScaremongerSC, the following have been brought to light:

Where it is shown that the OP in question claims to be JUST NOW ENTERING HIS SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL and only kissed a girl as of seven months ago.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1irtkq/taxi_drivers_whats_the_deepest_secret_youve/cb7fe5f

So he, apparently, is a taxi driver who overheard a couple in the back talking about how ""I still can't believe OUR SON got you pregnant.""

I request that he be charged for the following counts:

* Lying for Karma (x2)


* ~~Disruption of the peace~~

* ~~Causing Reddit a severe case of butthurt.jpeg~~

* Douchebaggery of the highest degree

* Karmawhoring

**As suggested, the previous two charges have been dropped and one count of karmawhoring and one count of douchebaggery in the highest degreee has been added.**

He has been a redditor for eleven months, so he must have been lurking for quite some time and something last week may have made him want to get loads of karma.

I am aware of a few of these posts being reposts, but not all of them. More research is necessary to ensure he has reposted 34 links in eight days, however it seems unlikely that he had sudden strokes of comedic genius over and over and over for the past week.

As of 9:00 PM EST, the post had acquired 55 total points.

The next day, at approximately 5:17PM EST, /u/trobsmonkey posted to /r/funny [the same image](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1ffdy6/im_actually_a_little_bit_impressed/), with the caption, ""I'm actually a little bit impressed"". As of 9:00 PM EST, the post had acquired 3,128 points, and was steadily growing.

As of aforementioned time, the top comment was 

&gt; ""Insurance Agent chiming in, I bet she was texting/on the phone. Hell, I can pretty much guarantee that's what it was."" 

In reply to this comment, /u/trobsmoney posted,

&gt; ""Guy who drives on this work campus, i'm positive she was texting."" 

The next independent top comment was from /u/trobsmonkey, stating, 

&gt; ""This happened behind the gym at my job."" 

However, /u/Amadacius was quick to notice a discrepancy. He posted in reply to /u/trobsmonkey: 

&gt; ""BULLSHIT http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1fbj3d/a_girl_at_work_made_a_serious_mistake
Posted by someone else yesterday. Fag.""

/u/trobsmonkey made several attempts to explain himself, posting claims such as, 

&gt; ""Op got it emailed at work and posted it, having never seen it on Reddit""

I believe /u/trobsmonkey does not work in front of the gym where this crash occurred. I believe he simply found the picture on our fine website and reposted it with an alternate caption, and is using his said backstory to hoard sweet, sweet karma. These actions are worthy of the charges of Shameless Reposting, Grandtheft.jpg, Aggravated Douchebaggery, and Bamboozling the Public.

In addition to this, /u/trobsmonkey has used his front page thread to reply to humorous comments with his own attempts at jokes, taking advantage of his post's prominence to whore himself out for comment karma, all based around a lie. These actions are worthy of the charge of Dirty Karma Whoring.

I believe in reality, /u/trobsmonkey only works as a dirty, shameless karma miner, willing to whore himself out to the highest upvoter. He has manipulated this situation to his own gain, and now that he has been caught in his web of deception, he must suffer the consequences. At the very least he is guilty of Shameless Reposting. 

Thus, on this day, Friday, May the thirtieth, year two-thousand and thirteen, I hereby formally charge /u/trobsmonkey with the 5 charges of:

* Shameless Reposting

* Grandtheft.jpg

* Aggravated Douchebaggery 

* Dirty Karma Whoring 

* Bamboozling the Public

May justice be dealt swiftly and properly, and may Karmanaut have mercy on /u/trobsmonkey's soul.

*I say we burn him.*

EDIT: In reply to my summoning message, /u/trobsmonkey replied,
&gt;  ""I post only to provide content. At no point did I claim ownership of the photo. I do not recognize your kangaroo court""

Therefore, at the very least /u/trobsmonkey is certainly guilty not only of Shameless Reposting but also of Grand Douchebaggery. I may also present the additional charge of Contempt of KarmaCourt, for bashing our glorious palace of justice while the case is in session.

If we are not ruled by a sense of justice and decency, then we cannot hope to have the authority to force it onto the masses. We must be steadfast leaders, showing the right way to Reddit, not a legion of corrupt guards, forcing prisoners to walk a path we choose without regard for what they deserve. For the most part, I see this, with almost all of us being careful in our words, and more importantly in our actions.

And yet, in many threads, I see malevolent downvoting wherever a defendant is called. Even if he or she chooses to act disrespectfully, we should not take the law into our own hands by downvotes. That is not what this court is for. If that was how we were supposed to act, we would not have debates or trials, but just a call to war whenever a repost or false claim is spotted. As has been said often, Karma Court is not a downvote squad. If the defendant disrespects the court, we add that to the list of charges and continue. They must be considered innocent until proven guilty, or everything we work so hard to achieve in this most sacred of courts is as nothing. 

So please, do not consider yourself above the law, but instead, think of yourself as of the law, with the sole intention of carrying it out as best you can. Think before you vote. I am not saying there should be no downvotes. Downvotes are a tool of the law to be used the same as any other. False evidence can be downvoted. Irrelevant posts can be downvoted. All I ask is that you not use your downvotes as a gag, stopping those called here from defending themselves. If we do that, we discourage them from coming, and if they will not defend themselves, then our verdicts are worthless.

1357096606.0,52,self.KarmaCourt,15szg2,Reddit v. /u/socialanxietyyy,Jayross,65,13,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15szg2/reddit_v_usocialanxietyyy/,"I am bringing charges against /u/socialanxietyyy on behalf of all of reddit.

**Case overview:**

In an AMA for a band member ('Slug') from the group 'Atmosphere', /u/socialanxietyyy says [he was at one of the shows](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/15s7t5/i_am_slug_from_a_band_called_atmosphere_ama/c7pbit7) and was the guy who did a stage dive after climbing onto the stage during a song. This is currently the top comment of the AMA, and socialanxietyyy has gained ~1,600 comment karma (as of this writing) and has received reddit gold.

Slug responds, saying he remembers the incident. Videos are posted.

Now /u/scuttsy responds, bringing attention to socialanxietyyy's AskReddit post titled [""I am a African-American male who does not fit into any stereotype that is stressed in modern America. Racists/Bigots of Reddit, how do you rationalize discrimination against me?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13izrz/i_am_a_africanamerican_male_who_does_not_fit_into/). The AskReddit post has been deleted by socialanxietyyy, but his comments in the thread are still viewable. [I have archived it here, in case he deletes his comments](http://www.redditlog.com/snapshot/210/240).

However, the [video evidence](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkrovDFhcto) of the stage dive incident seems to suggest that socialanxietyyy is white, not black as the AskReddit post seems to imply. I do not believe the video evidence is entirely conclusive, as maybe socialanxietyyy's skin tone is lighter, so I request that an analysis is done of the available video evidence.

If an independent forensics team would like to provide enhanced images taken from the video and put them in the comments below, that would be very much appreciated.

I believe the fact that socialanxietyyy deleted his AskReddit post is strongly indicative of lying of some sort.

Now, if it is determined that the man in the video *is white*, then there are a few options:

1) socialanxietyyy lied in [the AskReddit post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/13izrz/i_am_a_africanamerican_male_who_does_not_fit_into/) by saying he was black, when he was in fact white. The possible motivations for doing that are not clear.

2) socialanxietyyy was aware of the stage dive incident and thought he could take credit for it, maybe with the hopes of getting attention, comment karma, or acknowledgement from the band member. He is black, though, and did not lie about that.

3) socialanxietyyy has lied in both instances.

If it turns out #2 or #3 is the case, then that means socialanxietyyy has gained upwards of a thousand comment karma (as well as reddit gold) all based on a lie. If it is #1, then that is a lesser crime, and since the AskReddit post falls outside of the 21 day window, then we cannot prosecute that lie.

The [new Karma Court constitution](http://piratepad.net/ep/pad/view/ro.Nxo9wz9P0$gW3KM94F/latest) does not have an appropriate charge for this scenario, as I believe it is not a misdemeanor of douchebaggery, but there are no appropriate felony charges. I assume that since the constitution is new, there are still adjustments to be made. But for now, I am prosecuting socialanxietyyy under deceit felony charges.

That is the case for now. I am interested in finding out all of the information, including the true race of socialanxietyyy, and the extent of his lies.",,False,,t5_2v788,False,,,True,t3_15szg2,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15szg2/reddit_v_usocialanxietyyy/,

The title of the post in question was stolen from the top comment of one of his previous posts of the same exact picture.

New Evidence Appears to favor the legitimacy of the photo: [video](http://vimeo.com/14054518) from similar event presented by /u/syntaxofl

original:

I find it highly unlikely someone would take a screenshot of a video then send said screenshot to a friend instead of just posting the video online and reaping a giant financial reward and international attention.

If there was a video to go with this it would be one of the biggest of the last 365 days. This reminds of the countless bs nighttime hunting images of cougars and bears hiding in the bush unbeknown to the hunter, which reddit also buys until they're admitted to be fake.  

The case against this:

* There have been countless photos of unsuspecting humans in danger of a predator, as far as I'm aware they always turn out to be fake

* This is supposedly from a goPro. It would take more work to send a screenshot to friend than just upload to youtube

* If there was a video it would be worth 10's of thousands in ad revenue. 

* It still will probably gain international attention as a photo, but as a video it would be one of the greatest online videos ever.

* would let a friend post it

It is my belief that the defendant did in fact steal the content in question for the purpose of karma. To make matters worse, he then used an extremely cliched title for the post!

I urge this court to prosecute to the fullest extent of Karma Law.

8 counts of GrandTheft.jpg (1 for each picture)

and

1 count of Douchebaggery for using an overused and cliched title.

Submitted for the approval and administration of this illustrious court, I hereby charge user /u/Djion with ""Douchebaggery"".  I believe there are good arguments to be made on both sides.

The accused submitted [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/15u9lb/a_package_showed_up_in_the_mail_today/) almost one month ago, facially to express nostalgia for his old gaming system.

Today, the accused submitted [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/17g8d1/guess_what/), facially decrying gamer's expressions of nostalgia.

On the one hand, he could be railing against the expressing of nostalgia, of which he himself is guilty, on the other-hand he could be railing against the form of that expression, in the format of the post regarding nostalgia.

As I have received karma from pointing out this hypocrisy in his latest thread, I recuse myself from representing either side of this trial (unless there is no other representation for the prosecution).  I hereby request a judge for these proceedings, and ask that the honorable judge appoint appropriate counsel to both prosecution and defense.

The case of [/u/RodrigoAlves](http://www.reddit.com/user/RodrigoAlves) v /u/TJtheApple, [/u/Reggie-a](http://www.reddit.com/user/Reggie-a) and [/u/pineappleawesomness](http://www.reddit.com/user/pineappleawesomness). The three defendants have demonstrated that they are capable of committing heinous crimes which threaten to shake the very series of tubes this great interweb was founded upon. These atrocious crimes have been in the works for four months! /u/Reggie-a and /u/pinappleawesomness have escaped their crimes long enough, and it took the crimes of /u/TJtheApple to bring attention to their faggotry.


Today I was browsing the [Front Page of the Internet](http://www.reddit.com/) when I stumbled upon a fairly amusing [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/153b7d/checkmate/) on r/atheism. /u/TJtheApple blatantly posted [this image](https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/525024_403553126390080_1716497927_n.jpg) as his own, garnering a whopping 1019 karma at the time which these proceedings have been recognized, 5:05 AM CST, December 19, 2012. (EDIT 5:48 AM 12/19/12: 1300 Karma)

One comment in this thread was posted by /u/RodrigoAlves himself and upvoted to the top, linking the accused to the [very thread he started](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/xaatq/checkmate_atheists/) with the exact same image and similar title, *4 months earlier!*


I was aghast that a redditor would carry out such a despicable blatant case of Karma theft. I scrolled down in horror, only to find a redditor by the name of [lula2488](http://www.reddit.com/user/lula2488). Lula2488 is doing KarmaCourt's detective work for us as evidenced by their many posts, and their [post in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/153b7d/checkmate/c7izdvs) confirms that this particular image has been whored around ever since /u/RodrigoAlves originally posted it. I was shocked. Karmadecay clearly shows that /u/pineappleawesomness received 250 karma from their theft, while /u/Reggie-a received a massive 1336 karma for his crimes.  KarmaDecay shows that /u/RodrigoAlves posted this image 1 month before the defendants /u/pinappleawesomness and /u/Reggie-a, and 4 months before the defendant /u/TJtheApple.


Ladies and gentlemen of the kourt, I must speak plainly. This image might be slightly controversial as a tineye search will show. This image can be found on 9gag. Now whether or not this image came from 9gag to reddit or from reddit to 9gag is irrelevant (probably the latter). Here in the court, we know that no respectable Redditor visits 9gag.com, and therefore /u/RodrigoAlves was posting original Reddit content, and this court deals in cases of original content. No respectable Redditor saw this content before /u/RodrigoAlves brought it to their attention.

Bo used /u/brubasket to post comments, which he responded to several hours later.

http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1dcr3j/i_am_a_comedian_named_bo_burnham_ama/c9p9nru

Bo Burnham has earned nearly 1500 karma from making comments and replying to himself. This was an abuse of his AMA! He took time away from answering questions with the intention of collecting karma for his multiple accounts.

The prosecutor, /u/stqism, has charged the accused with 2 counts of karmawhoring to the 1st degree, and 1 charge of overall douchbaggery.

I am Mr. J. W. Hawksman, president of Hawksman &amp; Associates, together with /u/Thebearjew115, partner at Hawksman &amp; Associates, I'm filing for a case of perjury from /u/ImTheGuyWhoLoveGems. The evidence is simple, and conviction will happen quickly we believe.

The evidence is as follows. When /u/ImTheGuyWhoLoveGems was accused of GrandTheft.jpg, he denied. He told that he had actually sent the image he had seemingly stolen **to** the original poster. He said that in the following comment.

**Evidence 1, the comment claiming creatorship:** http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cbwub/imtheguywholovegems_charged_grandtheftjpg/c9f1ajq

Later, however, someone else came and claimed to be the original creator of this image. He was the person who first posted the image as well. His post claiming to be the creator of the image was this.

**Evidence 2, the second comment claiming creatorship by the original poster of the image:** http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cbwub/imtheguywholovegems_charged_grandtheftjpg/c9f2leb

When the original poster of the image was asked for proof of creatorship of the image, he provided the following.

**Evidence 3, proof of ownership of the image from the original poster, and rebuttal to evidence one:** http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cbwub/imtheguywholovegems_charged_grandtheftjpg/c9f2rg1

This means that, because evidence 1, and thus the claim by /u/ImTheGuyWhoLovesGems, is proven false, /u/ImTheGuyWhoLoveGems has lied in court. Perjury, ladies and gentlemen, perjury.

http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/153esj/challenging_uroblee8908_for_failing_to_stay_true/

In this case, we can see that a falsified account was created to impersonate another redditor and stand trial in Karma Court. The prosecution sees this as a capital offense and seeks the death penalty.

We hereby bring the following charges against /u/savoytruflle:

* Impersonation of a redditor with intent to deceive.
* Slander.
* Grand Perjury while under oath.
* Attempted money laundering.
* Aggravated Faggotry in the First Degree.

The accused impersonated an innocent redditor for two reasons. One, to defame /u/savoytruffle . Two, to be given Reddit Gold.

*whip crack!*

This is faggotry on an unprecedented level, and the prosecution seeks punishment of the highest order. Ask yourself if you were /u/roblee8908 , how you would feel if you had actually given Reddit Gold to this colossal, reality-bending black hole of a massive faggot.

The accused [has confessed to their crime](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/153esj/challenging_uroblee8908_for_failing_to_stay_true/c7jmlue) and their guilt is not in question.

**The case and charges**

It was on Wednesday, February 13^th, at 3:37 PM 2013 that /u/poopy_wizard132 reposted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/18g5wk/i_think_my_friends_cat_actually_wants_to_kill_him/) picture. Later on the same day at 3:52 PM he reposted [the same picture](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/18g6uo/i_think_my_friends_cat_is_actuslly_going_to_kill/) under almost the exact same title. The posts were in two different subreddits, /r/pics and /r/funny respectively. Unfortunately, this falls under the Fair Reposting clause in Article II. Declaration of Rights § B. thus rendering charges such as Repost.png inapplicable. I ask of you, honorable members of the court, to convict /u/poopy_wizard132 of Douchbaggery and False Advertisement due to the title of ""I think my friend's cat actually wants to kill him..."" This title is most likely misleading because the same picture has been posted twice before by different users over a year ago. It would be highly unlikely the cat in the picture is actually his friend's cat.

**The evidence**

As I saw this picture, I thought of this [comic](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/cat_kill) of The Oatmeal's. I figured I'd share a laugh with /u/poopy_wizard132 because of the similarities! Upon entering to comments in the post in /r/pics, I saw /u/nullghost pointed out this was a repost, linking to a search for this picture on [Karma Decay.](http://karmadecay.com/i.imgur.com/2k8chxo.jpg) Here are the links to the threads posted of this picture first: 

[Exhibit A](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/pa5nb/soon/) 

[Exhibit B](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/oozg9/cat_of_disapproval/) 

As you can see, the pictures in these threads are clearly the same; as mentioned by /u/nullghost, /u/poopy_wizard132 cropped the image, most likely in hopes of this repost not being picked up by repost detectors such as www.karmadecay.com.

It is possible, albeit unlikely, that the cat in this picture is indeed /u/poopy_wizard123's friend's cat, and he or his friend had posted this elsewhere on the Internet. Then this picture was reposted twice, a year ago, before its original owner posted it to www.reddit.com. In any case, [as pointed out](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/18g5wk/i_think_my_friends_cat_actually_wants_to_kill_him/c8eofrw) by /u/6675636b796f75 in response to /u/nullghost's comment on the thread in /r/pics, it would seem as though /u/poopy_wizard132 deleted many of his other posts. This could point to him reposting for sweet, sweet karma, then deleting his posts to rid of all evidence- thus adding to his charges Obstruction of Justice if true.

**EDIT**

/u/Rizzpooch has come forth with some very interesting evidence indeed! It would appear /u/poopy_wizard132 has already been tried and was found guilty, as seen [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1624yj/reddit_v_upoopy_wizard132/) /u/poopy_wizard132 was [sentenced](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1624yj/reddit_v_upoopy_wizard132/c7tjra0) to, and I quote: ""keep and maintain his records and submissions, not deleting them as prior. Continued offense will be met by severe fine of up to 2000 karma per offense."" I am as of now unaware if this fine has been met, as he has obviously continued to do this horrendous act. This would now also officially add to his offenses Obstruction of Justice, as he is deleting evidence. Unfortunately, there is no felony for not serving punishments-- perhaps a law might be added to the Constitution? 

**EDIT II**

I have added a list of court members below to keep things organized. A message was sent to /u/poopy_wizard132 regarding this post, and I do hope he shows himself soon.

**EDIT III**

The list of court members has been updated. If I missed you, please point it out!

I have made an [album](http://imgur.com/a/uXGUW) of /u/poopy_wizard132's posts and the Karma Decay report, as he is prone to deleting his after he has milked them of karma. The tag is from his [first trial,](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1624yj/reddit_v_upoopy_wizard132/c7tjra0) in which he was sentenced to being tagged ""LYING SNEAK."" I will attempt to update this album as much as possible. 

/u/poopy_wizard has actually responded to this post- whilst he is still a lying sneak, I applaud him for facing the court, as many defendants never show themselves in the courtroom.

**In summary**

/u/poopy_wizard132 is charged with one count of Douchebaggery, one count of Obstruction of Justice, and one count of False Advertisement for reposting [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/2k8chxo.jpg) to /r/pics and /r/funny and claiming the cat in question belongs to his friend. This picture was posted in /r/pics twice before, both around a year ago. I will leave requested punishment to the other members of the court. He has also been deleting evidence of reposts for quite some time now. Thank you for your time.

**EDIT IV**

It appears the case has been closed!

Jury member and apparently foreman /u/YourPostsAreBad has pleaded guilty. Judge /u/Thiswhatyawanted has [sentenced](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/18gy0i/the_people_of_reddit_vs_upoopy_wizard132_for_one/c8gdq56) /u/poopy_wizard132 to a downvote brigade on posts made up to this moment. Whilst I am satisfied he has been proven guilty, part of me wishes a harsher punishment would have been issued for a misdemeanor *and* two felonies! Alas, this could perhaps just be the fact I *am* the plaintiff. Ah well. Court adjourned! Thank you to all who have participated. I quite enjoyed it, and I believe that from here on I shall pursue a career as a prosecution attorney.

Posting in what many believe to be the wrong subreddit, as it is not at all WTF (but that is beside the point), NightmareZur claims that he did this himself, saying [""we have traps in the attic, and I was listening to Deadmau5 when I went to check them, which sparked the idea.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/19fl3x/i_dont_know_it_amused_me/c8nm2dj)

* First, a case must be presented by either victim or a self appointed prosecuting attorney.
* Second, a case may be deemed worthy of the court by a judge (also self appointed) commenting on the thread. It should be considered proper etiquette for the judge to explain to the court why the case is worthy, if for no other reason than to show the judge is capable. The top voted judge shall be considered the presiding judge. In the event of a judge being shown unfit for duties, the next upvoted judge shall be considered the presiding judge.
* Third, If not already self appointed, a prosecuting attorney will respond to the judge post with opening remarks. Multiple prosecuting attorneys will be decided by upvote.
* Fourth, At this time the defense attorney should make him/herself known to the court by replying to the prosecuting attorneys opening remarks with opening remarks of their own.
* Fifth, the prosecution will now call witnesses and question them. If the witness does not appear within one hour they are to be held in contempt of court and sentenced to 1 minute of r/spaceclop. (This may seem a harsh punishement, but in order for due process to work well, redditors need to take the court seriously). Questions are to follow linearly, as with a real world questioning.
* Sixth, the defense may cross examine the witness by replying to the witnesses first post with a question. Though there is no particular reason why this cannot happen concurrently to the prosecution's questioning, it should be considered poor form not to wait for questioning to end.
* Seventh, the defense may call witnesses, followed by the prosecution cross examining. This is identical to the previous to points, so i will not restate them
* Eighth, after all questioning has concluded (withing a reasonable amount of time), The prosecution may stand to present closing arguments. This will be done as a reply to the defense's opening remarks.
* Ninth, the defense shall stand to give closing arguments and rebuttal by replying to the prosecutions.(some may notice that the order of closing remarks has been switched from what happens IRL. I have proposed this because the reply format gives the prosecution an advantage of first impession. In an attempt to balance this i am giving the defense the last word)
* Tenth, the judge now replies to the defenses closing remarks.*If this is a civil case or a minor criminal case (such as repost.jpeg and below) the judge can make a verdict theirself. If this is a serious case requiring trial by jury,* the judge must ask the court to reach a verdict, being careful and considerate while weighing the evidence. *In this step it is proper for the judge to remind the people of the court why we are here (aka what charges have been brought forth), and to decide if the accused are guilty of these charges*
* Eleventh, a reply reading ONLY ""guilty"" and a seperate reading ONLY ""innocent""  are now put forth by random members of the court as a reply to the judges closing. Innocence and guilt are decided by largest upvotes. (An other model could be to have only one reply, reading ""guilty"", positive upvotes being guilty, negative upvotes being innocent). Ties are to be decided by the judge in reply format
* Twelfth, after a reasonable amount of time the judge will reply to the winning verdict with sentencing if guilty, or just some closing remarks if innocent.

Notes: All objections are to be made known by immediate reply to the objectionable post. 

Objections must occur before any other posts on the case are made.

 In the event of a judge being shown unfit for duties, the next upvoted judge shall be considered the presiding judge. All material submitted under the discarded judge shall be treated as it did not happen. This includes choosing of the defense and prosecuting attorneys, as well as witness testimony.

Mods are to be considered higher court judges and as such can overturn any verdict, request retrial, and generally do whatever the fuck they want.

Witness testimony delivered after sentencing can be reason for appeal or reopening of the case only if the presiding judge deems it worthy. 

*At all points during the trial it is the duty of the judge to keep the trail semi-on task, and can therefore have redditors held in contempt of court for creating a disturbance of proceedings.*

*If a judge is unable to reach a verdict, or a serious appeal is made, a mod judge shall be requested for resolution.*

In closing, I urge the mods to accept either this, or a better model discussed below, as the standard for Karma Court, and at the very least post a link on the sidebar. Discussion is welcome.

First, a huge thanks to all the users who have helped turn KarmaCourt into such a kickass subreddit. /r/NotaMethAddict and I started KarmaCourt a few months ago, and it's grown faster than I think either of us anticipated (you even kicked him out of the place!).

I've taken a hands off approach to the rules around here, I think the users should define the subreddit, not the moderators. And you've definitely taken it in some awesome directions that I never anticipated, so rock on guys.

But... There have been a few disagreements, so a bit of 2013 housekeeping:

---

There are no officially sanctioned KarmaCourt spinoff subreddits, but I strongly recommend that you subscribe to /r/KarmaCourtGazette, seriously, it kicks ass. As far as  the other subreddits are concerned, none of them have any real affiliation with KarmaCourt.

---

Which leads me to the KarmaCourt Konstitution, huge props to everyone involved. But I think it's been misinterpreted by a few of our users as a set of rules that must be followed to the letter. Think of it as a set of community guidelines that you can all work towards together, but the moderators will not be removing posts that violate the Konstitution.

[Keira Knightley palate cleanser.](http://i.imgur.com/Cno4C.gif)

---

And this one seems to have caused a lot of confusion lately. There is no official process for choosing a prosecutor, defense attorney, judge, or any other office. If you want to defend the accused, that's great, but don't be a dick to anyone else who tries to step in and help. 

As of right now, the only real rule we have is don't downvote the accused if they choose to comment in the thread.

---

And finally, everyone who has applied to moderate the subreddit or offered up your help, please check out KoreanTerran's thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15uu2j/mod_post_weve_been_getting_quite_a_few_messages/).

[His own repost](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/15ruy0/facemask/)

Currently searching for more reposts by him; will add any more visible ones later.

/u/franklinmason, however, does not have 30,000 karma or more, but has gained nearly half from reposting his own [possibly] alt account in the same month.

[Proof](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/1bnsfn/facemask/)

I hereby submit that both posts be downvoted (whether it matters or not) and the newest one removed, as /u/fhmason has enough karma to make the charge of repost applicable.

**IMPORTANT EDIT:** /u/Mozza215 would like to add three further charges of lying, racism and douchebaggery with the aim of misleading the Reddit people.

**EDIT 2:**/u/Yankee_Doodle_Dickwad would like to submit charges of the court bricking him up in this very court room and evacuate the building for eternity, but the prosecution will consider settling for a socially responsible sentence such as being told to grow up, on top of his clients requests posted originally.

*IMPORTANT NOTE:** Although these posts have been removed since three months ago, the charges of repost still stand. The date of repost does not matter; on the other hand those comics were submitted two hours apart. Now there is another of those atrocities present on the front page of /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu...Wait, what is this!? **IT HAS BEEN TAKEN DOWN?**
___________________________________________________________________________________

Also, /u/fhmason has not reposted any other comics, but submitting posts over 3 months and no comments is quite suspicious.

Just for kicks, this proves that not only are his comics racist, nobody really liked [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/1bllmh/boss_lady/).

______________________________________________________________________________________

**VERDICT FROM /U/PUROMICHOACAN**

I have reviewed this case throughly. I have decided to threat both accounts as two different redditors.
When it comes to /u/fhmason he's is innocent of all charges by the statue of limitations set forth by our constitution.
When it come to /u/Franklinmason I found him guilty of Douchebaggery in the first degree, racism and lying. He should serve 24hrs in /r/new.

Now comes the complainant, me, charging /u/fluffy_cunt with one count of Grand Theft, the defendant having blatantly reposted another user's OC to /r/funny with no proper attribution or credit.

**Evidence**

1) OC: [Original handdrawing by /u/captain_nutcracker, posted to /r/funny 3 months ago ](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1b0zmn/rgonewild_oc/)

2) Opportunity: [Posted as comment in /r/cringepics earlier on the day of the theft](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1i2tyx/some_delicious_gw_cringe/cb0klt8)

3) Blatant Theft: [Posted under a new title in /r/funny by the accused just 4 hours later with no mention of original creator]  (http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1i4625/rgonewild_in_a_nutshell_nsfw/)  

As a result of said repost, the accused gathered over 2300 karma at the time of filing, more than the OC itself (2100).  Accused has over 31,000 link karma over the course of two years, and has been accused of blatant reposting before, but quite honestly, complainant is too lazy to find it.

&gt;As seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/16k79r/til_that_a_roman_merchant_who_sold_fake_jewels/c7wsw7x), /u/le_trolliest fully admits to knowingly copying a top headline in the attempt to gain karma.

In regards to the charge of aggravated faggotry - 

The submission history of /u/KARMAGAMER shows a willingness to engage in deceitful and plagiarizing tactics in order to accumulate link karma, and an unwillingness to engage in any sort of communication with the populace of reddit as to his reasoning.

The remaining two submissions of the defendant are also reposts, but since they are both currently residing at negative karma score, no crime has been committed.  The prosecution is prepared in it's case, and is ready to present further evidence and call witnesses.

Esteemed ladies and gentleman of the court!

I browse reddit as a gentle creature, never trying to cause angst or irritation. It gives me gas. **BUT NOT TODAY!** Today, a shameful, *shameful* deed has been done, something that sickens me to the core.

/u/monkeydragon12, not too long ago, posted a picture of an apparent photobomb of our one true god, [Nicolas Cage.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gml05/nicholas_cage_photobomb/) This is all fine and dandy, it is rare indeed to see the Almighty Cage in the wild and I enjoy basking in his light whenever a snapshot is taken.

**BUT I WAS DECEIVED!** When I went to check out the comments, expecting to see all the other believers rejoicing, I instead was shocked to find that /u/monkeydragon12 had *lied for karma*. 

The top comment, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1gml05/nicholas_cage_photobomb/calnwwj) suggested the image was photoshopped to feature the lady in the center, when originally [*she was not to be seen*](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1fvmik/friend_of_mine_ran_into_nic_cage_at_a_store_in/)

It is obvious to me that /u/monkeydragon12 has acquired the image previously on reddit and spread a web of lies and a mist of deceit over it to gain sweet, sweet karma. Normally, I pass 'shopped images right on by, but this I cannot abide! 

***

The charges are thus:

**ONE CHARGE OF SACRILEGE** For disgracing our lord Nic Cage by blemishing a rare picture of his presence with fake images.

**ONE CHARGE OF SHOPPED.JPG** For intentionally photoshopping an image to alter events and gain karma through *lies*.

**ONE CHARGE OF KARMAWHORING** For pandering to reddits infatuation with Nic Cage and lying to gain karma.
***

There may be charges I have overlooked, so feel free to request any more to be added on. 

If found guilty, I believe /u/monkeydragon12 should have to watch *Face Off*, starring Nic Cage and John Travolta, a minimum of four times in a row, and at least once with commentary.

This picture was reposted to /r/wtf by /u/hairysachs in blatant violation of section B of the constitution.   He provided no credit, and no indication that it was a cross-post.

Evidence:
[Article 1: The first appearance of the picture as part of a comment by /u/RichardWang](http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/15ypbz/bought_a_bottle_of_something_called_ergotin_if_i/c7r91ff)

Screenshots have been taken in case the defendant attempts to remove evidence.

EDIT 1: After grave and careful review of the evidence and our Constitution, I would like to state my formal charges against the defendent /u/hairysachs.  For the blatant violation of section B, a charge of PettyRepost.txt is brought against defendent.  In addition, given the audacious nature of the theft, the obvious importance of the object to the Plantiff, and the shitty/uncreative title given to the repost;  I hereby level an additional charge of Douchebaggery against /u/hairysachs.  As a member of our great community for 5 months, he has no excuse for his actions, and no leniency should be shown.  Truly, ladies and gentlemen, /u/hairysachs represents the worst kind of redditor, and the worst kind of human.  

EDIT 2:  Submitted for the approval of the court:  additional evidence demonstrating that plaintiff is the owner of the article in question, and that the reposted picture represents created content.  In addition, circumstantial evidence that the story presented in title of title of article 2 is truthful in that the plaintiff has a girlfriend.

---

ABSTRACT:

/r/shittyaskalawyer was created over 1 year ago, while /r/askashittylawyer was created less than 9 months ago. This is clearly an infringement of highly intellectual property. It has potentially cost hundreds of karma to the posts and comments within /r/shittyaskalawyer. Reparation is demanded.  /u/toxic_duck, as founder and sole moderator, is held accountable for payment of reparations.

---

REPRESENTATION:

I, /u/googunk, hold the titles of: founder, recurrent OP, 1st mod of, and absolute shitty legal authority of /r/shittyaskalawyer

By virtue of my station, I am the most qualified shitty lawyer within the community, as I am empowered to determine the quality of submissions and advice within the community.  Therefore, I am qualified to act as litigating attourney.

As a frequent commenter and submitter, I am a member of the affected class and thereby qualified to act as primary litigant. 

As primary and majority stakeholder of the entity of /r/shittyaskalawyer, I act with absolute power of attorney on it's behalf.  Furthermore, I act in limited representative authority of all moderator approved post OP's within /r/shittyaskalawyer, and are held responsible for empowering their maximum return of karma.

---

CHARGES:

It is submitted /u/toxic_duck, creator of /r/askashittylawyer is guilty of misrepresentation by attempting to gain visibility by intentionally seeking users to inadvertently subscribe to his/her own subreddit while said subscribers were in-fact seeking out the preexisting /r/shittyaskalawyer.

It is submitted that /u/toxic_duck thereby denied rightful karma to the OP's and commenters of /r/shittyaskalawyer, either by willful usurpation of the syntax of shittyaskalawyer or by negligence in failure to conduct due diligence in identifying the existence of such a subreddit before launching his own.

---

EVIDENCE:

Be is known via the following Exhibits:

A. /r/shittyaskalawyer was founded greater than or equal to one year prior from today, but not more than 2 years. As evidenced by sidebar indication of being ""a community for 1 year""

B. /r/askashittylawyer was founded greater than or equal to 8 months prior from today, but not more than 9 months. As evidence by sidebar indication of being ""a community for 8 months""

C. REDACTED. Exhibit C has been dismissed by the prosecution. While carrying both exhibit C and a glass of spoiled milk in opposite hands, I inadvertently put exhibit C into my kitchen sink and instead brought the spoiled milk to court with me today.

D. /r/askashittylawyer presently holds subscription by no fewer than 9 readers as evidenced by sidebar indication of ""9 readers"".

E. At the time of 9 months prior to this day, /r/shittyaskalawyer was a member of the shitty network, and appeared in the bar of links at the top of every shittynetwork member site. It's existence was thereby overt and available for discovery by any willfully seeking party.

---

PROSECUTING OPINION:

By virtue of the fact that these subscribers believed they were subscribing to the preexisting and greater visibility subreddit of /r/shittyaskalawyer, posts within /r/shittyaskalawyer may now go unseen by these 9 readers. It is reasonable to conclude that /r/askashittylawyer has potentially cost a maximum of 9 positive karma to the OP's of all posts within /r/shittyaskalawyer for at least the prior 8 months up to the present day.

---

REPARATIONS REQUESTED:

It is hereby requested that the court find the following judgements against /u/toxic_duck

1. A penalty of positive upvotes for every 8 month and older post within /r/shittyaskalwayer.

2. Immediate cease and desist of operation of any present and future shitty legal advice subreddit.

3. Action of immediate solvency of /r/askashittylawyer

4. Apology in the form of a personally created image macro of a sad looking baby animal stating that they are sorry. The phrase ""I'm really super sorry, seriously."" must occur at least once. The image of the sad baby animal may be procured via google image search, but not via /r/aww.

The charges?

*Shitty crossposting*

As you can see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/10p5j7/this_man_has_caught_hundreds_of_major_league/), on September the 30th, in 2012, I, the plaintiff and avid sports fan, posted a highlight reel of YouTuber Bobby Crosby's home run catches. The post in question skyrocketed.

However, just a mere few hours later, [prule84 crossposted my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/10pohx/dodger_phil/) in, quite frankly, the most shitty way possible. Paying no reference to the previous post, and not even acknowledging that it was a cross-post, it made it to the front page of /r/baseball.

Here is where shit gets real. In the video, Crosby clearly and audibly shouts ""Yeah! Dodgerfilms!"" after every catch, and dodgerfilms is clearly the username of his YouTube account. Prule84 believed that Crosby was actually shouting ""Dodger Phil"", as if it was his nickname. Why in the fuck would he should ""Dodger Phil"" is beyond me.

It is clear that the intentions of Prule84 was to improperly crosspost my post to /r/videos. [The post was made around the same time my post skyrocketed.](http://karmawhores.net/user/Jonny_Watts) Furthermore, both links are identical, and both links actually link to a playlist.

The second, shittily crossposted link, caught the attention of Crosby himself, who [is a redditor](/u/bobbycrosby). Prule84 not only crossposted crappily, but called Crosby the wrong name **to his face**.

An unfortunate, unfortunate crime.

Redditors, this is KarmaCourt. The hearing is now in session.

---
The case
---

On behalf of /r/leagueoflegends, /r/Minecraft, /r/runescape and /r/lolstreams I file this case against /u/DryNinja.

People of Reddit, Dear Judge and Grand Jury, yesterday /u/DryNinja posted in /r/leagueoflegends that he wanted to host a [24 (in letters: twenty-four) hours charity event raising money](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1iccda/keep_me_alive_24_hour_charity_live_stream_in_24/), as he said, for ""$150/£100"", by streaming his games playing League of Legends. If he does not reach the goal, he would pay it from ""his own pocket"", he said.

Explanation: streamers, for example on www.twitch.tv, can earn ad revenue by playing a game. Top streamers who reach several thousand (in numbers: 1000s) viewers every time they stream on a regular basis can earn several thousand (in numbers: 1000s) dollars this way per month.

Fifteen (in numbers: 15) days prior to that he made a [similar post with the same title](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1hc57l/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/) (""Keep me alive!"") in /r/minecraft.


Earlier he posted, with the same title, in the following subreddits: [runescape](http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/1hch73/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/), [LoLStreams](http://www.reddit.com/r/LOLStreams/comments/1hc5ca/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/), [Minecraft (1st post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1hc57l/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/), [Leagueoflegends (1st post)](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1hc3nf/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/).

---
Accusations
---

I hereby request to condemn the user DryNinja for the following charges:

* Fraud: 

1) asking people to watch his stream pretending to be ill in order to collect money

2) avoiding the /r/leagueoflegends posting rules which disallow ""Streams, unless for an event.""


* Zimmermanism: abusing his ""illness"" in self-defense
* Perez Hiltoning in combination with Attention Whoring: trying to get attention by pretending to be ill and arouse pity

in six cases.


--- 
Reasons
---

1) The first post in the Minecraft subreddit, he refused to provide any safe evidence only stating he [would ""try to find some proof""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/1hc57l/keep_me_alive_charity_stream/cat4gzr).

2) The defendant, despite his illness, could drink a lot of alcohol previously: [Exhibit A](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1iccda/keep_me_alive_24_hour_charity_live_stream_in_24/cb3e8y3)

3) His ""evidences"" cannot serve as real proof: [Exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/SXe7Xez.jpg), [Exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/85wC8kn.jpg), [Exhibit D](http://i.imgur.com/L0g8BJ2.jpg)

4) Because of the newest /r/leagueoflegends posting rules the defendant had to create an event in order to prevent his post being removed by the mods. Raising $150 (in letters: one hundred fifty) seems odd. Usually, charity streams raise, for unpopular streamers, at least $1000-$2000 (in letters: one thousand up to two thousand), popular streamers up to $20,000 (in letters: twenty thousand). In addition, $150 (in letters: one hundred fifty) rather looks like some pocket money and not something that justifies an ""event"".


5) ""I tried my best to convince you all this is not a scam"". What, Grand Jury, did I miss? Some google translations and google mail screenshots cannot serve as proof which justifies an expression as ""I tried my best"".


6) It is strange that the defendant posted this twice. Did his first try in /r/Minecraft not generate enough income or is he just trying to make his stream popular?

I request an expert to analyse Exhibit A and Exhibit D. The question I ask myself and Reddit serving Justice should ask is: 


1) Can you drink that much alcohol if you have this specific illness?


2) Does this specific illness cause this skin erubescences?

**Case background:** Approximately 10 days ago, /u/roblee8908 posted this AskReddit thread, titled: ""Reddit, I would like to show my support to reddit by buying the first commenter on this thread reddit gold. What are you willing to do?""

This title (which will be referred to as *the terms*) laid out the agreement for the reddit gold exchange. As the terms dictate, the first person to post in that thread would receive reddit gold. No other conditions are established.

/u/savoytruflle is the first person to post, thus entering into the proposed deal with /u/roblee8908 under the set terms. However, it has been 10 days and roblee has failed act how the contract obliges him to, even claiming that he will *never* fulfill his end of the deal.

**I hereby bring this case to the high magistrates**, in hopes of reaching a legal and just course of action to the problem brought towards you here today.

It is with this agenda that I enter into these halls of justice on this fair morning. With your permission, I will proceed to present the rest of the evidence:

&gt;Where the FUCK is my gold, you lying shit huffing OP?! I should have known you were full of shit with this BULLSHIT TOPIC!!!!

&gt;WHERE THE FUCK IS MY REDDIT GOLD!!!

&gt;I posted first, roblee8908, and you PROMISED Reddit Gold to the first poster. ME. Yet here I sit, goldness. You fucking bitch. You're a pathetic liar, an asshole, a frog fucking madman, and a dick. Go fuck yourself.

Savoytrufll now, days later, has followed roblee8908 into /r/apple with the the aim to confront him about why he had not followed up on the terms of the askreddit thread.

This is when /u/roblee8908 apparently decides to end his agreement with Mr. /u/savoytrufll, and illegally backs out of the contract which the terms clearly laid out the details of.

* [u/roblee8908's thoughts on why he thinks he should be able to end the contract](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/152288/one_of_the_few_ios_annoyances_that_actually/c7ittcm)

When asked to clarify the terms, says:
&gt;I made no promises. But would I have followed through on buying the first commenter reddit gold? Yeah, probably, if the guy didn't start making threats toward me before I even had the chance to. So for $3.99 thats how he reacts? I don't think I will entertain him, sorry.

So, this is where things have ended so far. It is ongoing, but I want to lay charges before roblee has a chance to flee reddit and escape into /r/mexico or something like that. Also, I feel it is best to discuss this issue in the court of law, instead of polluting the other subreddits with the public bickering and arguments.

I previously was the Prosecutor for 13KCC-07-1i82c9. This case was closed with /u/MyAnDe being found guilty for the charge of grandtheft.jpg

At the start of the above mentioned case I attempted to make contact with the OP of a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/156ott/my_dad_passed_away_from_cancer_spread_from_his/) that came into question as fake, a thread that caused my client, one /u/queenvagina to be called a liar, a karmawhore, and consequentially was downvoted into oblivion.

The purpose of this case will be  to have my client exonerated in the eyes of Reddit.

Evidence:

[Exhibit A](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/156ott/my_dad_passed_away_from_cancer_spread_from_his/) - My client's original thread with her story. Just looking through this it can be seen that my client suffered abuse and insults that were more than unecessary.

[Exhibit B](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/157zd7/userqueenvagina_two_people_have_outed_this_user/) - A case in these courts that was brought up against my client that ultimately ended in stalemate. There was no official verdict but the damage done to my client is irreparable until justice is found.

[Exhibit C](http://imgur.com/MmwERtL) - My client sending me a picture with again her OP after finding out that /u/MyAnDe stole her content and re-posted it for their gain.

[Exhibit D](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1j0c73/uqueenvagina_vs_reddit_for_charges_of/cbabl59) - ~~Pending until I speak to my client due to the sensitive nature of this evidence.

Doing so broke /r/mildlyinteresting's rule that reads thusly:  
&gt;* Do not submit anything which has been submitted anywhere on reddit before.

The defendant submitted the same post there *twice.* This is only the story of one, albeit their most grievous, offense.

/u/hellotherefinesir reposted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/12n8ix/blue_stop_sign/) /r/mildlyinteresting post to /r/pics ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1hg2m4/blue_stop_sign/)) and then AGAIN to /r/mildlyinteresting ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/1hg2ka/blue_stop_sign/)), breaking the aforementioned subreddit rule.

They also reposted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/19en1c/my_buddy_peeled_a_clementine_and_it_looked_like_a/) submission to /r/pics and then again to /r/mildlyinteresting [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/1hg2gq/my_buddy_peeled_a_clementine_and_it_looked_like_a/)

In the last case, the defendant kept the original title including the words ""my buddy,"" claiming then that the image was his.

Between now and the time this post was originally made, the defendant has once again reposted, this time [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1d0so8/drove_like_that_for_about_2_miles_so_that_car/) post reposted [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1hgdo8/drove_like_that_for_about_2_miles_so_that_car/)

As we all know Reddit depends on user submitted content, and has been gathering submitted content for many years. It is impossible for anyone that is not machine to keep track of every single item that has been posted.

""Use the search"" you might exclaim. To that I reply ""Try using it yourself."" The Reddit search engine is so bad, that it makes trying to identify what content has been submitted before.

Also, as a quickly growing website, Reddit gains many new users each day. These users probably haven't seen the content before and are unable to identify a post as a ""repost"".

With these considerations in mind I make a motion to define the span of time that must pass from the last submission to the time a new post is submitted during which the new post can be called a repost. Otherwise stated: how much time must pass for a link to be called fair game.

**INSIGHT**

Ladies and Gentlemen of the Court.

Approximately 10 hours ago, /u/ThaBadfish posted [this picture here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1k2j21/so_my_gfs_friend_took_a_selfie/cbkrsu4) onto /r/pics, claiming that the person in the picture is his girlfriend's friend on the top of Mount Everest. 

**HOWEVER**

It is pointed out by /u/FerrumCenturino that [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1k2j21/so_my_gfs_friend_took_a_selfie/cbkrsu4) was taken off of GoPro's instagram account. [Evidence can be found here](http://instagram.com/p/czNwUwrf8n/).

Finally, he then reposts the same picture and same link to /r/humanporn [as shown here](http://www.reddit.com/r/HumanPorn/comments/1k2jog/so_my_gfs_friend_took_a_selfie/) in an attempt to gobble more karma up. The mod bot took the post down as it wasn't formatted correctly.

* One Count of First Degree Karma Fraud
* One Count of First Degree ~~copypasta.exe~~ grandtheft.jpg

The post does relatively well, garnering 1167 net Karma.

However after this, all his (the accused's) submitted content does poorly, and so he resorted to what the court can only describe as self-faggotry: Reposting his [OWN MATERIAL](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/15jcj9/my_brother_has_been_a_lotr_fan_for_years_i/) on 28/12/2012, but with a completely different story (now he had found the ring for his brother as a Christmas present). The post failed miserably, but the crime stands.

But there's more! In a discovery that was made after the original accusation, it was found that even the original story regarding the garage sale was false, as a person we can only assume to be /u/jjfish1998 (the user deleted the post after it failed so their name is missing) made [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vn1iy/my_grandpa_works_with_metal_he_gave_this_to_me/) post 6 months ago as well, this time claiming it was a 19th birthday gift from a grandfather who was a metal worker (despite the fact that the accused is a 14-year-old faggot).

But we're not done yet, if you try to find the embed codes for the image in question on imgur, the story once again changes, to [being a gift from a younger brother](http://imgur.com/lBJXN?tags). At this point, the prosecution isn't even sure what the hell is happening.

**EDIT (Further developments)**: /u/TheReasonableCamel has brought into light evidence that [the post regarding the metal working grandfaher was made by another user](http://karmadecay.com/www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/vn4p3/my_brother_found_this_at_a_garage_sale/), and therefore theft must also be added to the original charge of Karma fraud.


**TL;DR OP reposted already *stolen* content 6 months apart with a completely different back story in an attempt to get more Karma. The original seems to be from /u/erews, but another exists with as of yet unknown origins**




-----------------------


**FINAL EDIT: A DECISION HAS BEEN MADE.**
/u/jjfish1998 is found GUILTY of Karma theft and subsequent fraud.

The crimes of the defendant are undeniable, but due to their confusing nature and their being posted 6 months apart, they court will give a more light punishment:

* The OP (henceforth tagged as ""Self-Fag"") will be subjected to as many downvotes as the people of Karma court deem fit. There does not seem to be sufficient outrage regarding the matter, so this should be relatively light.

* However, any member of the court that sees fit (prosecution, defense, and jurors are especially encouraged to do this) can send the OP mildly insulting (though not hateful) messages. This includes edited version of [THIS PICTURE OF OP](http://i.imgur.com/Ukl7M.jpg) (the court is not yet sure which one of these faggots is him), memes, etc. This does NOT however include partidulcarly disturbing images like anything from spacedicks.

There are many cases which are being delayed or stopped altogether because of this, and it is stupid. So, here are the two things that we need to do:

1. Is this subreddit going to be serious or not? I know that most of the mods want it to be like /r/circlejerk, but I know that most of the users want it to be a serious place to play lawyer. So, let's have a vote. If the majority of people want it to be serious and the mods won't give in, we'll just move to another subreddit or maybe they'll do what their users want. If the majority of people want it to be circlejerky and the mods don't, the same thing can happen. I think that this should be a serious subreddit because it's fun and because the circlejerk users already have /r/circlejerk and could move to a subreddit like /r/karmacourtcriclejerk if they want. So, let the voice of the people be heard. There is a poll here: http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=5128435ae4b05a936af9aa83

2. The main problem that trollaway had with the mods was that they weren't active enough and that because of this, rulings took too long to make. This can be avoided if we get more judges. We will do this by giving judges extra flair for every case they've presided over. It would be an image flair and a number next to it to show how many cases they've done. We could also make it customary to upvote judges as will as to give reddit gold and stuff as a tip of sorts.

So, it sounds pretty simple, but we need this to go into effect quickly, before the subreddit falls apart. We need the moderators to give this plan their support or opposition so we know what side they're on here. We need the constitution to be reinstated ASAP and we need court to resume.",,False,,t5_2v788,False,,,True,t3_192clr,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/192clr/hello_everyone_im_here_to_fix_this_subreddit/,

From that list, third party plugins such as the popular Reddit Enhancement Suite (/r/enhancement) would be able to take measures to help thwart the effect of the offenders. This could possibly be by tagging them, tagging their posts, or ideally the posts from reposters wouldn't even show up on one's pages.

Banning criminals from Reddit would only shut down the account but would not prevent a serial reposter from continuing their crime spree using a readily available alternate account. However, preventing people from seeing their posts would protect the victims of reposting since the offenders would not be able to tell whether or not their reposting crimes were noticed so they would likely continue reposting under the same account thus making the blacklist even more effective.

True, an offender could change accounts once they notice that they have been blacklisted but that would require sacrificing their treasured horde of karma.

Edit to add: As long as the Karma Court provides due diligence in cases, it would even be possible that a list could be used by Reddit proper and incorporate Karma Court criminal records into how karma is accumulated. For example, the worst offenders might have just 1% of their net upvotes reflected in their karma score which would reduce the incentive to repost.",,False,,t5_2v788,1357662312.0,,,True,t3_166ti8,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/166ti8/maintaining_a_catalog_of_offenders_to_allow_third/,

Exhibit A: [The Post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1fh3rw/princeton_made_me_into_a_business_man/) Here other user name tells us about how she faked ADHD in high school for extra time on the SAT's and eventually made upwards of 12,000 dollars in princeton. This post also states that she is a ""Business Man"" as in male.


Exhibit B: [This post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/18s12i/he_broke_up_with_me_anyway_rightfully_so/). This post clearly states that the user is female, contradicting the Business Man post.

Exhibit C: Street prices of Adderall [\(Link\)](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081022211900AAOX2hO) are around 5-10 dollars a pill. We will now assume that the average prescription would be one a day, there are 180 days in a High School year. We will assume she did this the last year. If she took none of them during the school year she would be left with 180 pills. We will be going with the low end on this calculation, 180 times 5 dollars is 900, far less than the twelve thousand the user alleges she made. Likewise at 10 dollars a pill it would end out being 1800. 

So what we have here is 180 adderall pills OUT of high school. We will assume that she went to college immediately after High school, an average College year being 160 days, we assume it a 4 year college. She now has 800 pills. Assuming the low end, she has 4000 dollars. The high end 8000. Both substantially less than the poster has said.

Exhibit C: [TL;DR by another user](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1je56r/this_was_just_submitted_into_f7u12_some_classy/cbdwn4r)
   
/u/hatchetlock's submission on /r/cringepics refers to a (cross)post on /r/ragecomics (not even in f7u12 as the post advertises) made by /u/trollfun2001. This account was opened shortly before /u/hatchetlock made the submission in question. Just to make things more complicated and interesting, it turns out that the original submission is by /u/trollfun2000 and was indeed posted on f7u12.   
So this means that /u/hatchetlock's submission is an x-post of an x-post, with two throwaway accounts involved. His submission's title did not match it's contents. /u/hatchetlock may have revealed himself with a Freudian slip by mentioning f7u12 in the title of his post.
(In addition, the original post tries so hard to appeal to the /r/cringepics audience that it could be mistaken for satire. Barely any effort was put into this ruse. [/u/4511 knows what I'm talking about](http://www.reddit.com/r/cringepics/comments/1je56r/this_was_just_submitted_into_f7u12_some_classy/cbdwc8f))

------------

http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaConspiracy/comments/1i5np2/ujij_gets_an_upvote_every_time_he_gets_a_downvote/

As we can see here, the defendants already show their disdain for my cilents, and blatantly disregard [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) to show their hatred and attack his posts. They also do it through the lazy way of down-voting through the profile, over which there are already defences created by the system. Once they encounter these defences, instead of willing to learn about the system, ^((which tells us that when you cast a vote from a profile, an up-vote and down-vote is added to the users, to prevent drive-by brigading)^) they immediately attack my clients and claim that they have bot accounts running to up-vote them! The instigator ^((/u/conthrowawa)^) even uses a throwaway account, so that this demeanour cannot be linked back to his true identity!

Now, I say that this can not go on any longer, so I have brought this matter to court to sort it out once and for all. I am a lowly executioner, who carries out justice when the ne'er-do-wells are found guilty, but I will serve as prosecution in this case, so that these individuals can be brought to justice.

------------

The crimes that these criminals are accused of are:

* Use of false Identity to carry out misdemeanours
* Blatant disregard of Reddiquette
* Defamation &amp; Slander
* Conspiracy to get my clients more down-votes
* General Duechbaggery

**CASE:** KCC13-08-1jp20t

****************************************************************************************************************

Good evening all, /u/motionless19 here, posting on /u/solvbjerg's behalf.

Plaintiff originally filed this complaint against the defendant.

&gt;""Starting to get a bit annoying that /u/eramainamor, keeps reposting famous posts/reposts and even copies the title of the most famous reposts.""

An official RSPD report has been made [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/shamepolice/comments/1jp137/report_on_u_eramainamor/), and an investigation will be ongoing until the case is closed. 

~~It is unsure at this time whether or not the defendant has been confronted at this time, but it's safe to say having 15+ front page (re)posts that they have been confronted before.~~

Most of (if not all) of the defendants posts include a top comment of someone calling him out for reposting. And yet he continues.

Plaintiff made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1joy4h/simply_amazing/) reply to a post by the defendant, earlier today. Defendant made no reply to this comment, except to delete the post.

/u/eramainamor was confronted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1jp3i2/a_fleet_of_foxes/cbgvp9b), by RSPD officer /u/motionless19 on another repost submitted in the last 30 minutes. User deleted this as well

Defendant is also [karma farming](http://i.imgur.com/Clj4tqL.png) someone else's OC, as he has posted the same content twice, on two different occasions. He was called out about reposting this content on both occasions by different people.

Some strange evidence is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/1iz57y/confused_dog_on_an_escalator/cb9ozke?context=3)

The accused made [this submission](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/16xlwl/i_fits/) to /r/aww. The picture has clearly been submitted to /r/aww on [multiple occasions]( http://karmadecay.com/i.imgur.com/8eos7vW.jpg). 

When asked if the cat was his/her own cat, the accused [stated]( http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/16xlwl/i_fits/c80dh7z) that the cat did belong to him/her and that this was the first time he/she was submitting it to reddit. While it is possible that the image was the accused’s original content and migrated to reddit through theft by another, it is highly unlikely. In all likelihood, the accused not only intentionally reposted in an effort to obtain Karma, but also lied about it. 

Probable cause exists for these charges and /r/KarmaCourt should find the accused guilty.

EDIT: /r/Makkannoo deleted his initial reply in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/16xlwl/i_fits/c80dh7z) in which he/she claimed that it was his/her cat. While I do not have photographic evidence of the accused's statement, I am willing to testify to the content of the statement.

Item 1. **[The post in question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1hpzok/redditors_what_is_the_most_powerful_photograph/cawsrog?context=3).**

In his post, the plaintiff quoted /u/Charlie91, who had made a comment regarding ""the colour of his eyes,"" in regards to a soldier in a black and white photo. /u/pimp-bangin found it slightly humorous that /u/Charlie91 would make a comment concerning ""colour"" when in fact, the picture was black and white.

Admittedly, this was corny humor, and at best was expected by the plaintiff to receive a few upvotes, and possibly one or two downvotes.

*However*, /u/Doovid97 made a particularly presumptuous remark, stating ""Woah, people in different countries spell words differently!?"" His interpretation of the plaintiff's original comment can be directly discerned from the rather sarcastic comment. Following this remark, /u/pimp-bangin received a comment score of -49. 

---


The plaintiff claims that /u/Doovid97 turned the people of Reddit against /u/pimp-bangin by misinterpreting /u/pimp-bangin's intention, then making a presumptous, almost libelous comment, clearly harming the reputation of said user.

The plaintiff is suing The People of Reddit for 49 comment karma in the form of upvotes to the post in question for misinterpretation of a comment, and an additional 5 karma for emotional stress, for a total of 54 comment karma.

I have always considered myself a tireless defender of the wrongly accused, but something has so affected me that I have temporarily ignored everything familiar to me, and will prosecute. Many of you may have noticed a distinct lack in movement in the case of ""the people of reddit v. /u/bballgamer"". The defandant brought forth this case and whipped up a storm, and the case gathered momentum. As we speak it is the 10th highest post of all time on the subreddit. 

Following a wonderfully delivered speech by /u/VanBuren22 ,the defandant's lawyer, philllesh claimed that he would return tomorrow to give his opening statement. This can be seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/18ngpx/the_people_of_reddit_vs_ubballgamer_charged_with/c8ggdc3). 

The plaintiff has not returned. Since then the case has stagnated, not doubt resulting in a loss of karma for /u/bballgamer. 

I suggest that /u/philllesh be charged with time-wasting.

Edit: I am not on some personal vendetta against /u/philllesh. I am happy to withdraw this case and everything I have said now that he has returned. Perhaps real life events prevented him from posting.

Maybe I was rash I posting this. But if I will be charged with time wasting if I dismiss the case now, I have no choice other than to proceed.

EDIT 2: I hereby withdraw my case and I will have to deal with the repercussions of my actions.

1. The title of the post refers to the setting as a bus.

What Follows is a list of cases which just don't meet a standard. Note how I didn't say ""our standard"" or ""the standard."" These cases do not meet any sort of standard for anything. They are genuinely uninformative KC Court Requests without a sliver of the info required to make a case!

[**India/World News Case**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1isrj9/people_of_reddit_versus_uskundz_for_posting_more/)- No Charges, Update, Details, Court Members, and minimal examples (out of 45 options...seriously).

[**A Guy Who Doesn't Like KC**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1iu5tq/upakattak_vs_the_users_of_rkarmacourt/)- No Details of any kind, except that OP doesn't like this subreddit.

[**A Case that may have been a Case but Was Dismissed because there is no argument or info**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1irp8y/people_of_reddit_versus_urepoststopissyouoff_for/)- No details other than a single charge, No exhibits, No Update, No Court Members.

[**A Case with No real Title, and No actual case Inside**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1iskco/croc_clock_repost_stuff_like_crazy/)- Seriously, it is a text post of a single link. Why are people commenting in this?

[**A Case with No Charges and Little Description(Other Than the Title)**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1irqht/ulonemoonshiner_versus_uwyatt656_for_baseless/)- No actual evidence provided of the accused crimes.

[**I don't even know What is going on here**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1irt06/people_of_reddit_vs_ummofan_for_one_count_of/)- The plaintiff claims the evidence speaks for itself. I, however do not know what fake.jpg is (unless reddit has suddenly banned all not-real content. Then I understand, and mourn the loss of /r/spaceducks). If you want to charge someone with a crime of your own creation, please define the crime in full. Otherwise I'm charging OP with Cheese.jpg. Good luck getting out of that one.

[**No Charges in the Post Proper**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1iry6g/the_people_of_rgaming_vs_kin_no_megami_for_karma/)- OP is e-hurt that someone wants Karma. Imagine if this was actually a crime- wanting karma. Wow. The /r/ShamePolice budget would be skyrocketing. Make up a charge more than ""BeingRedditor.jpg.""

[**Duplicate Request for India/World News, no details**](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1issl5/the_people_of_rworldnews_vs_uskundz_for_spamming/)- It is like the original India/World News case, only worse. Like no details at all worse.

Solution: Link them here! Link them to my other post [""Crease a Case.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourtBlog/comments/1io53w/karma_court_classroom_01_create_a_case/) Want to be more obscure? Link them to the Wiki Page and the Constitution (both linked in my previous article). Feeling generous? Walk them through this process, but don't go by these cases and say nothing- or worse- participate in these hot messes of text.

I can't do much more, It'll look like I'm spamming. We AS A COMMUNITY need to get some semblance of format back in these posts, or there will be no order in our courts.

 I pour my soul into each prosecution and every defense.  People need to recognize that; demand, as court players (read: jesters), that they *at least* put the relatively minor effort required to start a case, before the masters debate ^(heh).

Date- 03/29/13

Case against - /u/MrSada

By- /u/Etru and other people of the F7U12 Community

Prosecutor- /u/Etru

Reasons-

1.) Mr.Sada reposted one of the posts of /r/funny. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/1b87lc/looking_through_my_news_feed/) is his post, and [Here](http://karmadecay.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/1b87lc/looking_through_my_news_feed/) is my evidence that the post is posted several times on /r/funny.

2.) Mr.Sada has violated the Rule 1 and Rule 3 of /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.

Rule 1- No non- rage comics allowed.
 Evidence- If you have a close look at the comic posted, or I may say, *reposted* by Mr.Sada, there are no rage faces in the comic. Rage comics HAVE to have atleast one rage face. Therefore, Mr.Sada's post cannot be considered as a rage- comic.

Rule 3- No reposting.
 Evidence- With the help of KarmaDecay.Com, I have successfully found out that the post by Mr.Sada has been reposted several times on /r/funny. [Here](http://karmadecay.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/1b87lc/looking_through_my_news_feed/) is the help provided by KarmaDecay.Com.

_____________________
My first reaction was that I was amazed at the talent (I saved the photo to my computer and now it is a background, still an impressive image), but as I looked into the comments, well I present Exhibit B.
___________________
Exhibit B: A comment by /u/joereimer :
&gt;I'm calling BS. I'm a professional painter and this looks suspicious to me. There are a few alarm bells going off. First, it looks like it's a digital painting made from a photo... not an original painting. Second, this guy is sells HDR/Photoshop tutorials... (ie. he knows how to use Photoshop). Finally, the photos he took show very little texture. In fact, it looks exactly like a print that's been varnished to look like it has some texture, but it would have way more texture if it was a real painting. I also make canvas prints, so I know the difference. Why would he take photos with such a shallow depth of field... unless to hide the face that there isn't any texture? He said it's difficult to take photos of paintings for the internet, but I could easily take a photo of any of my paintings to prove it's a painting. I mean, I could be wrong, but knowing who this guy is and the fact that he posted a link to his website that sells Photoshop tutorials, I'm about 99% sure he just took one of his photos, manipulated it in Photoshop (probably a combination of Photoshop's oil texture filter and the smudge tool).

To which he makes an edit, leading to Exhibit C:

Exhibit D: A comment in response to Exhibit B by /u/kepleronlyknows
&gt;Here's the EXIF data..
Date Time Original: 2008:07:05 21:38:24 Exposure Time: 1/1000 F Number: f / 2.80 Exposure Program: Aperture priority ISO Speed Ratings: 200 Metering Mode: Pattern Flash: Flash did not fire Focal Length: 28mm White Balance: Auto white balance Make: NIKON CORPORATION Model: NIKON D2Xs LensInfo: 280/10 700/10 28/10 28/10 Lens: 28.0-70.0 mm f/2.8
Edit: it's technically possible this was the camera that photographed the painting, but that's highly unlikely. When using a copy stand and a camera to photograph paintings, you use a shutter speed of 1/2 of a second, whereas this was 1/1000 of a second. Also, focal lengths of 100mm are the standard for copy cameras, and op used a focal length of 28mms. OP's settings are exactly what you'd use to shoot a shot at dusk into the sun, not shooting a painting.

You'll notice, a confused redditor in the second snapshot who at first accused me of deleting my own comments then sees that my comments remain visible in my profile, demonstrating I did not delete them.  

Second, you may go to my profile and see all of the comments are still there.  If I had deleted them myself, I could not restore them.  

Third, you'll notice on my profile, a comment on a post by /u/davidreiss666 that says ""More shitty submissions from a shitty submitter. ""  

My argument: This is a clear example of kimjongun.rar, insult the mods, face retribution.  This also demonstrates moderators violating their own sub rule ""Do not ... Report a submission just because you don't like it. The report function is only for spam and inappropriate content. "" 

In terms of relief, I ask this court to grant a decree encouraging all redditors to shake their fists menacingly at /r/politics, like an old man yelling at kids on his lawn.

As a note, I'm friends with occasional judge and mod /u/judge_velociraptor, so I must ask that another judge be appointed, in the interest of fairness.

So submitted.
____________________________________________________________________

Edit:  New facts have come to light.  Most of the deletions have been reversed and a reply from one of the mods states it was a 'mistake'.  I maintain my suit, as no explanation has been received, and this still caused several of my substantive comments to suffer, as later comments were able to replicate my arguments.  I would also like to foreclose an affirmative defense that the defendants may make.  This was not likely the result of the decision of a robot.  Not only were most of these comments deleted long after they were made (though not much longer after my sassy comment to DR666, which remains deleted), but a few random comments remained after this purge, suggesting the work of an errant human, not a precise, cold and calculating robot.  I request we press on.

Reddit user /u/Ced777 is being accused of false accusations and defamation inflicted on /u/earlysong 's character. 

The post in question: http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15k73x/reddit_vs_earlysong/

**Please take into consideration**

1) The Redditor /u/Ced777 has no standing to sue. A quick search on the sidebar reveals that the above post is the first and only post made by /u/Ced777 on this sub-Reddit. The prosecution would like to note that any perceived damages done by /u/earlysong has had no effect on the defendant.

2) The court had not yet ruled on the case opened by /u/earlysong. By opening his case early, /u/Ced777 sets a dangerous legal precedent to allow any case in /r/KarmaCourt to be determined by a race to the bottom of filing legal proceedings. We should actively work to assure that our sacred process does not fall prey to bureaucracy.

3) If /u/earlysong 's case is ruled in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant in this defamation case must answer to the law. Similarly, if the defendant cannot produce evidence of any wrongdoing on the part of /u/earlysong, then he/she must face the full force of the law.

Both defendants and prosecutors are aware of this.

The real issue is, is it 1) zero-effort, do-whatever-you-like-whenever-you-like satire, or should there be 2) more structure, more regulation and more effort. 

""Taking it seriously"" means having a karma court with more structure, regulation and effort. Some people enjoy that aspect and want to explore it further. 

During the creation of Karmacourt, obviously the mods perceived and set it up to be a 1). Trolaway is trying to move it towards a 2).

Trolaway's case against the mods actually perfectly encapsulates the purpose of Karmacourt, and set up a perfect opportunity to resolve the two conflicting visions regarding it. 

That he tried to try the mods in Karmacourt is EXACTLY satire.  In the trial, the mods and Trolaway could have had a discussion towards whether karmacourt would remain 1) or shift to 2). It could have been (and still can be) fun and exciting way of discussing the conflicting visions and purpose for Karmacourt.

Instead of having the discussion by trial, the mods decided to go ""fuck you trolaway"" on a youtube video.

Exhibit A: [The post in question.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/15opym/reddit_what_is_your_worst_roommate_story/c7ofakq)

Here, mohamm2706 has told a story that they would have you believe is autobiographical, regarding setting their roommate Errol’s crotch on fire. By my account’s view, it has exactly 2000 karma as of the time of this post. 

Exhibit B: [The CollegeHumor post]( http://www.collegehumor.com/upick/6696092/burning-bush) entitled “Burning Bush,” dated January 30, 2012, almost a full year ago. 

As you can see, the post has been copied and pasted, mohamm2706 not even bothering to change “Errol’s” name. 

Exhibit C: [The CollegeHumor “uPick” thread]( http://www.collegehumor.com/upick/roommate-confessions/fame), which has the exact same conceit as the Reddit thread. 

“Burning Bush” is the most popular, highest-rated, most easily visible story on the list.

As a long-time lurker, I created an account only recently to bring this crime to light. The most heinous aspect, in my opinion, is that they received Reddit Gold, conning some poor individual to reward mohamm2706 for his stolen content using their real-life money.

----------

Stabulousity has formally charged mohamm2706 with GrandTheft.jpg (reposting for 1000+ karma), will withhold charges of OhShit.exe (reposting for Reddit Gold) due to the latter crime being added to the constitution after the defendant's alleged crime.

We are doing everything that we can to bring justice to this lofty, excellent website. We are succeeding in many places, but we still are falling a little short in others. I feel there is one main area in which we are truly failing, and that is in the charges that are being levied against defendants in the court. They must be standardized.

Just a quick glance at the front page shows that there are defendants being charged with [First Degree Picture-Stealing Faggotry (Grand Theft .jpg).](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15b8ro/the_people_vs_usersackett66/), [Aggravated Faggotry in the First Degree](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/156dsi/usavoytruflle_has_committed_grand_perjury/), [blatant karma theft](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/154i4d/i_humbly_submit_to_the_court_a_case_of_blatant/), [OP [being] the mother ship of all faggotry and [being] the cancer of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/151gln/this_may_be_old_but_this_needs_to_be_brought_to/), and a multitude of others.

In this subreddit's [esteemed and excellently prepared law review](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/14wyfk/karmacourt_law_review_2012_4th_quarter/), there were several proposed and/or previously established charges. While this was excellently phrased, I would recommend that this court standardize further.

**The most common accusation charged against users is some sort of ""Faggotry"". It is my humble recommendation that all charges placed on this site shall be considered some form of ""Faggotry"". A defendant should only be charged of some sort of ""Faggotry"" if they have taken to the comments section, or if they have taken the situation to other subreddits. Simple, possibly dishonest defense of the repost through a single comment should be considered petty faggotry, more than one comment general faggotry, and either five or more comments, or taking the repost and its defense to multiple subs should be considered gross faggotry.**

**When it comes to picture reposting, I am of the opinion that there should be different distinctions, with different punishments to be considered by the finder of fact in each individual case. I feel there should be three main distinctions in reposting, none of which are exclusive of the other.**

* Karma Theft
* Karma Conspiracy
* Blatant Reposting

Quoting myself from a [previous case](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/153rha/i_bring_before_the_court_an_abhorrent_case_of/):

&gt;The charge of Karma Conspiracy rests upon the accusation that a user looked at other posts, saw the karma gained by them, and chose to repost them under either a different name, or with the same name, for the sole purpose of gaining karma.

&gt;It runs slightly differently from Blatant Reposting in that Blatant Reposting is considered so in that it is shameless, glory gaining repost. Blatant Reposting is for the glory. Karma Conspiracy is a plot to gain karma.

&gt;Karma Theft is different from the other two in a few ways. It is also the hardest to defend against. Karma Theft can be done accidentally, and it can be done on purpose. If you do it on purpose, you could also be accused of either Blatant Reposting or Karma Conspiracy. Karma Theft is the reposting of a picture and gaining unearned karma for it. The work put in to rehost on imgur or some other website is not comparable to the work done in thinking it up, finding the appropriate picture, etc. Note that my referring to most things done on the internet as work is done with tongue in cheek.

A [recent, excellently worded case](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/15b8ro/the_people_vs_usersackett66/) that I have seen has made the interesting addition of the term GrandTheft.jpg. I find this term hilarious, and propose that we standardize this even further. Reposts that gained under 500 karma should be charged, as a further distinction of Karma Theft, with pettyrepost.jpg (note the lower case, and one word), reposts that gained between 500-999 karma should be charged with a simple repost.jpg, and reposts that gained 1000+ karma should be charged GrandTheft.jpg.

Note that these karma counts should be based upon *net karma*, **not** gross karma.

The three types of repost, Karma Conspiracy, Blatant Reposting, and Karma Theft may have ""Grand"" placed in front of them if there are multiple instances of reposting being brought into the court at once.

I would also like to note the clear lack of distinction between karma criminal court and karma civil court. While this suggestion is not as important in my eyes as the others, it still matters to me. If a case is brought into the /r/karmacourt we have established, and it is in the format of /u/userone v. /u/usertwo, only certain sentences should be entered. A civil case does not necessarily have to benefit the public at all, and should just involve the potentially losing defendant going into the plaintiff's post history and upvoting everything for a defined number of pages, in an effort to return some karma.

More cases should be tried as Reddit, or /r/karmacourt, or various other subreddits v. /u/reposter. This will make it so that sentences we enter, ie spacedicks browsing, new browsing, or other sentences that the court sees fit, actually make sense for us as a community to enforce.

There have been multiple efforts by individual users to institute a ""downvote brigade"" as a sentence of the court. I am of the opinion that this is not a good thing for us to do as a sub. Aside from the fact that becoming a downvote brigade is a really easy way for our esteemed court to get into a lot of trouble with the website, it is explicitly against reddiquette. Under the ""Please don't"" heading, you'll find this:

&gt;Mass downvote someone else's posts. If it really is the content you have a problem with (as opposed to the person), by all means vote it down when you come upon it. But don't go out of your way to seek out an enemy's posts.

Remember that all of these are independent suggestions by an independent judge/public defender. You are under no obligation to listen to my suggestions, but I do feel that they are excellent ones. I would gladly appreciate comments, and other suggestions. I can edit this post further if there are comments that the community at large (or me, get real, this is my post) find to be especially insightful.

In closing, thank you for reading this rather long post about something that means a lot to me for some reason. I'm glad that you'll be considering these suggestions (hint hint **Mods**), and I look forward to working with all of you in the future.

Immediately after posting this, I will message /u/semishock with a link to this thread so that he can make a case for his defense.

[Exhibit D](http://www.reddit.com/r/needamod/comments/1jbfio/my_new_subreddit_onlymodsallowed_needs_more_mods/)

---

1. I argue the creator of /r/ONLYmodsallowed is blatantly ripping off another subreddit, and is trying to create a circlejerk without anyone to circlejerk him. 

2. By having OP asking for mods on /r/needamod should be considered the equivalent of begging for karma

3. OP  has excess bravery as demonstrated by Exhibit C

**/r/shamepolice vs. Mod /u/untoastedwaffles creator of /r/Onlymodsallowed**


THE CHARGES

1.    Blatantly Ripping off a Subreddit - This charge is self explanatory, the accused filed and created a subreddit, that has no clear or present distinction to another subreddit.

2.    Cirlejerking without a permit - This is filed along with the above charge (2) because the defendant is creating a fraudulent circlejerk subreddit in which him and others circlejerk.

3.    2muchfedorabravery.exe - OP has excess bravery as demonstrated by Exhibit C

4.    Circlejerk1.lol - self circlejerk or the equivalent of masturbating in public.

---



 Charge 2 comes along with charge 1. The accused created a fraudulent subreddit, a fraudulent subbreddit for circlejerking, thus the defendant has no permit to circlejerk nor endorse circlejerking to occur. By constitution is a user permitted to post in paraody subreddits? yes, but not when they are fradulent and without permit.

Charge 3 - It has become . apparent that the picture posted is not the accused. However deletion of the post may be considered tampering with evidence. These charges will be followed by the DA office if until we are given an explanation of why this was deleted.

 Charge 4 is a simple charge based on the accused behavior, it is obvious that the accused wishes to jerk, and jerk he did. Jerked so hard it landed him in court. This jerk was not private, it was not funny and it blinded my dog. This scum must be brought to justice.

§ A. Inalienable Rights
All redditors are given these rights, regardless of previous offences:
3)The right to appeal, if he or she feels the verdict was unjust.
The Verdict in REDDIT V. WIRED was unfair and brought upon the defense by a jury who clearly visited the case in order to prove the defendant guilty, regardless of the case's outcome, judges ruling, or attorney's performance . 

On top of this, the Charges themselves ignore the blatant fact that the Original Article (Exhibit A) my client is being charged for was satirical in nature, suggesting that readers appear like hobos and sit on street corners for cash as well as beg for free pizza on Reddit. The two are equally ridiculous according to the article. (Exhibit Y).
Finally, I would like to move for a new judge (using a Justice)- not based on any fault of the previous judge, but to ensure that justice is properly served and this case, regardless of outcome.

The  JUSTICES of KC retain the right to intervene in a case and take the judgeship responsibilities if they find a judge is not properly doing his/her job.
For this trial to be fair, I must demand a detailed jury selection of FIVE (5) members who can prove themselves to be unrelated to the case, and a new judge, preferably a full Justice, to help dispense justice.
In order to accommodate this neutrality, I feel that a period of Three (3) Days be given to the Defence and Prosecution to Enact Voire Dire, and allow the jury to be selected only upon recommendation of BOTH defense and prosecution, based on Reddit history and a one-two questions posed by each the prosecution and defence.
If the Five Member jury cannot be decided upon, then I recommend Three (3) similarly selected jurors, before moving to allow the judge to rule- based on his own immense power and knowledge- on this case.

as seen in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1eqipw/minirecap_the_rape_saga_of_cmitchell404/) /r/SubredditDrama thread where /u/CMitchell404  claims to be a rape victim and tells a male rape victim that her rape was worse because it was vaginal. 

In addition he was given reddit gold TWICE when talking about [his post rape experience](http://np.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/1eopg0/after_2_and_a_half_years_of_court_cases_it/ca2bnv5) that's two counts of the highest crime our court can punish (ohshit.exe)

as seen [here](http://np.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1fz9xz/lies_deceit_and_general_douchbaggery_utriballore/), that's right he has filed a case against /u/triballore for his [sore loser post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1fytuf/breaking_op_posts_a_picture_of_a_message_a_sore/caf76u3) as explained earlier at the beginning of this thread. Whether or not /u/triballore is guilty (he probably is guilty) is case for another day, my point is this lying scum of a troll thinks he can walk in here and demand justice. Luckily his post is at zero karma currently, but maybe a fool  just [like the ones who upvoted his comment to 276 karma](http://np.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fx98k/the_difference_between_a_good_loser_and_a_sore/caf3nag) may come along and give this tyrant more karma.

Is the Karma Court only here to maintain the equal playing field in the pursuit of Karma?  Or, does it have the power to bring justice to individuals that have committed heinous acts unrelated to the gain of Karma?

On the morning of February 7th, 2013, /u/Learned-Hand opened his message box to discover a PM from one, /u/maryadams2.  The Prosecution would like to submit that message at this time:

http://i.imgur.com/bJyk45y.png

As you can see, Defendant is engaging in a poorly-executed attempt to defraud innocent redditors.  Now, I am not naive enough to believe that Defendant's exploits are limited to reddit, but we recognize that this Court's jurisdiction does not extend to outside endeavors. 

The Prosecution admits that Defendant did not commit these crimes in the pursuit of Karma.  However, this should not prevent the Court from delivering justice.  The Prosecution has carefully chosen charges that it believes apply to misconduct unrelated to Karma.  This was a blatant wrong-doing, and I think we can all agree that reddit would be better without Mary.  This Court has the power to do that, now you must choose to exercise it.

The Prosecution charges Defendant with one felony count of Art. III §B 2(e) False Advertisement; one felony county of Art. III §B 2(g) Spamming/Self Promotion; both counts aggravated by Art. III §A  1(a) Douchebaggery.  In the event that the defendant is found guilty, the prosecution recommends the harshest punishment allowed by law, up to and including Art.

This is a novelty that parodies the annoying speeches made by a Diablo III follower character, often edited slightly to meet the context of the post.**

I hereby bring the charge of Douchebaggery upon the moderators of /r/ShitRedditSays. I was ['benned'](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/15tf6s/comedian_kenny_hotzs_gets_asked_if_he_has_sex/c7ptm21) for merely posting in character on a novelty account. I have posted previous comments in character [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/ybkao/my_tv_is_black_quick_nail_it_down_before_it/c5u6tni) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/y13kx/effort_poop_when_asked_am_i_the_only_one_around/c5re5vf) and met no such ban.

&gt; (a). Douchebaggery - A catch-all offence for when the accused is being deceitful or intentionally misleading. Douchebaggery can be added to any existing charge before the court if the accused obfuscates the process of justice by acting like a dick. May also be a felony if the douchebaggery is deemed severe enough by the judge. 

This charge perfectly applies. The mods were being deceitful by not explaining what rule actually prohibited novelty accounts, plus were being dicks in their responses back to me.

**Under the Karma Court constitution, the moderators of SRS breached the following sections of Article II:**

1) S. a. 3.

&gt; The right to appeal, if he or she feels the verdict was unjust.

[Screenshot of message log here.](http://i.imgur.com/8Qvqda6.png)

In this message log, /u/ArchangellePretzelle, /u/ArchangelleFarrah and /u/ArchangelleSyzygy are clearly depicted not taking this appeal seriously. They even try to use the argument of just ""joining in on another account.""

These three mods responded to my appeal and I do not know which moderator banned this account from SRS. However, the initial message was addressed towards /r/ShitRedditSays. Their entire moderation team was made aware of my issue.

2) S. a. 4.

&gt; The right of habeas corpus, the right to request trial for wrongdoing before banishment from certain communities.

I was banned from /r/ShitRedditSays under no warning, under no defined rule on their sidebar, and under no official outlined policy banning novelty accounts.

3) S. a. 10.

&gt; The right to post on parody subreddits without persecution, such as /r/CircleJerk

SRS defines itself as a circlejerk under Rule X:

&gt; **RULE X: SRS is a circlejack and interrupting the circlejack is an easy way to get banned**

However, the user /u/wykrhm decided to capitalize on the scare (and still is to this minute). He posted a non-functional link to http://store.steampowered.com/app/570/www.dota2.com/www.dota2.com/betaisover ([[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1hys1v/dota_2_beta_is_now_over/), [[archive.is]](http://archive.is/OMfID)).

When a user was supposed to click on it, it would redirect to the purchase page ([[2]](http://archive.is/fse8G)). However, if a user removed the store.steampowered part of the URL, leaving only www.dota2.com/betaisover, it would redirect to the main website for the game. ([[3]](http://archive.is/C0fwE))

Instead of immediately deleting the post, the accused left the post up. At the moment, it is at #1 on the /r/DotA2 /hot page ([[4]](http://archive.is/djoa6)), and is still raking in karma. The post approximately has ~550 points ([[5]](http://archive.is/ceXHj)) at the time of case submission, and has raked in ~440+ karma according to karmawhores.net ([[6]](http://www.reddit.com/user/wykrhm), [[7]](http://www.karmawhores.net/user/wykrhm)).

Therefore, I feel that the accused should be tried for the charges previously listed for not only failing to take down the post, but also lying to his own people when he is a moderator there.

Further, I intend to show that this is chronic behavior that has only gone unnoticed in the past because /u/hypnoguy1's posts had never been so successful. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1a6qyj/goalie_saves_the_corner_and_then_something) we see a similar act occuring one month ago, and here are two more of his videos posted on reddit via an obvious sockpuppet account /u/upupvote11: [1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gz7LsDrT9jQ) [2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NJf8ZneANM)

Given the use of sockpuppets, theft of content, and chronic behavior, I move that we also charge the defendant with one count of douchebaggery.

**EDIT 1:** Upon further review, I've uncovered yet another sockpuppet account, /u/hotmandingo, which posts videos from both the YouTuber ""thehypnoguy2"" and ""thehypnoguy1."" This goes even deeper than I had anticipated.

**EDIT 2:** Our judge has been named: /u/turbo566.

**EDIT 3:** Redditective /u/DiggDejected has uncovered [a whole slew of sockpuppet accounts](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1dj0gp/people_of_reddit_vs_uhypnoguy1_for_multiple/c9r1itr) including one case where a sockpuppet [attempted to post one of hypnoguy1's posts to /r/BestOf](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/15tcwz/great_advice_for_dating_from_the_perspectives_of/). In light of this new evidence, I am adding an additional charge of Karmasturbating in the first degree.

1357493556.0,19,self.KarmaCourt,162g9i,Assigning Karma Court case numbers,DellaStreetJustice,23,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/162g9i/assigning_karma_court_case_numbers/,"There was [recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1623np/karma_court_records/) touching on the subject of records keeping in which I asked about how case numbers are assigned. The reply was to ""Count how many posts there are and add 1"" which has workability issues:

* If two people simultaneously assign court cases then that can result in a number being assigned twice.
* If a case is deleted it will throw off the count and can also result in a duplicate case number.

To bring order into the assignment of court cases I propose that the court use a standardized system for giving each case a unique identifying case number which will assist in record keeping and search.

I suggest something along the lines of the following:

* Begins with KCCID which stands for Karma Court Case IDentifier. This serves as an explanation for the items to follow.
* UTC date of case posting in Y#### M## D## format to allow for searching all cases from a certain date, month, or year. Example: A case from today would include Y2013 M01 D06 and could be found with a Google search.
* The Reddit post ID, the multiple characters that uniquely identify the post which show up in the place of the asterisks in a typical URL like so: http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/******/reddit-vs-johndoe Using the post ID will avoid collisions of case numbers.
* An optional but recommended inclusion of the offense. I recommend a standardized shorthand for each different charge. M&amp;DB for Misdemeanor Douchebaggery, M&amp;DEF1 for Misdemeanor Defamation First Degree, or F&amp;GTJ for Felony GrandTheft.jpg.

For example, the case of [/u/knetel37](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/14ddlj/uknettel37_submits_a_pic_he_claims_was_drawn_by/) would be assigned a case number of: KCCID-Y2012-M12-D06-14ddlj-F&amp;GTJ

Standardizing case numbers with a system similar to the above suggestion means that someone can easily search for all felonies on a certain date, all cases in a calendar year, etc. Furthermore, these case numbers can be assigned retroactively either manually or better yet with a bot which could just post a comment in the thread assigning the case number.

As much as I would like to see a decrease in Karma crime here on Reddit I'm afraid that there will always be those who try to act outside of the rules of society. With the ever increasing growth of the Reddit user base there will only be more and more cases and a greater need for easily reference specific court cases. There will certainly be instances of repeat offenders and relying on a case name like ""REDDIT V. JOHNDOE"" will not be enough to identify a unique court case.

It is my hope that some form of order can be brought to this court system. Thank you for your consideration.",,False,,t5_2v788,False,,,True,t3_162g9i,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/162g9i/assigning_karma_court_case_numbers/,

She also alleges that this made her hated for **most** of middle school and **part** of high school. Middle school is grades 6 through 8, high school grades 9 through 12. The phrasing of ""most of middle school"" can only be reasonably interpreted at having happened sometime in grade 6, making the remaining two years awful. Slenderman was created on the SomethingAwful forums in June 2009. Even if we assuming that a 6th grader paid for access to the forums as is required, this still means that OP is at the oldest in 10th grade. Given this stretches every ""fact"" of the case (the above-mentioned access to Slenderman before it was popular, referring to ""part"" of high school despite currently being one year completed with it, etc.) it seems to be a straightforward example of lying for karma, with OP counting on the over-saturation of Slenderman causing people to forget how relatively recent a creation it was.

I submit to you, that on the early morning of February 23, 2013, this link was submitted to /r/funny with the caption ""Dropped Flour on MY Cat by Accident"".

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/192j6t/dropped_flour_on_my_cat_by_accident/

If it pleases the court, I submit that this is NOT the defendants cat [makes obnoxious gesture with arms] and even more distastefully, the defendant is only claiming that this fine creature belongs to him in an attempt to garner karma for himself (hence the charge of misdemeanor Douchebaggery).  As proof of this I submit the following:

http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/17ftx5/dropped_some_flour_on_my_cat/

As the court will see, this picture is a repost from 25 days ago - a minuscule timeframe and one that most certainly fits the timeframe for the charge of blatant reposting, even noting the level of upheaval currently ricocheting through this fine institution we know as the Karma Court.

I am OUTRAGED that /u/cudidudi would have the audacity to misrepresent such a fine creature and claim it as his own.  I am OUTRAGED that /u/cudidudi would DARE to attempt to garner the good will and karma of the people in such a blatant and provocative act if reposting.  My outrage is fueled even further by the fact that just FIVE DAYS AGO, cudidudi posted a comment for criticizing another Redditor for reposting.  This shows not just a blatant disregard for the laws of this fine court, but a vile sense of hypocrisy rarely seen.  As evidence, I submit this to support my charge of felony Douchebaggery:

Firstly, I propose that the term ""GrandTheft.jpg"" be replaced with ""GrandRepost.png"", and secondly that the definition for ""PettyTheft.jpg"", ""Theft.jpg"" and then ""GrandTheft.jpg"" be constructed in the same manner as reposts. My initial proposal is this:

&gt;PettyTheft.jpg - A false claim of OC that results in less than 200 karma.

Before we can start taking sentenced criminals from the /r/KarmaCourt (apprehended by the boys at /r/KarmaPoliceDepartment ) I need to hire some Correctional Officers to keep those prisoners in line. As a CO, you will have flair identifying yourself as such and have all of the rights and responsibilities that follow. To apply, just post on this thread, the one on /r/KarmaPrison or shoot me a PM! I will probably hire 11 COs then get them to vote one as their leader. 

In addition to COs we need some Executive Prison staff to help manage and moderate the COs and Prisoners. These ranks are as follows:

*W-Warden:
--
Newkd
*CPO-Chief Prison Officer
--
*SPO-Senior Prison Officer
--
*OM-Operations Manager
--
*CM-Correctional Manager
--

The process of being hired as an executive officer is a little more rigorous so if you wish to try just PM me.



Thanks for reading! 



May swift justice reign,
**Newkd**

during my daily stroll through reddit, I came across a rather tasteless post by the defendent, /r/KazakTheSpaceDog , concerning the Connecticut shooting. 

As if this were not bad enough, the caption of the post read ""guess this was a bit too edgy for /r/toosoon"", and has presently reaped over 900 points for it.


But the top comment, posted by /u/djmnfg , submitted evidence to the contrary of the defendant's caption. It reads ""in /r/toosoon it's at 113 right now. fuck you""


Since then, it has gained to 451 karma in /r/toosoon

I was then accused of posting an offtopic gif in an attempt to karma whore.  If the court would be so kind as to notice the mouse in the gif is eating a piece of popcorn.  

""Popcorn"" has long been a part of SubredditDrama since its inception.  In the sidebar of the sub it even provides links to popcorn containing gifs.

After /u/sceptix made his false accusation a downvote brigade arose and beat the fucking shit out of that poor little popcorn eating mouse.    I tried to point out that the mouse was eating popcorn but the downvotes continue. 

One of the moderators of the sub /u/semebay even pointed out the longstanding history of posting popcorn containing gifs in SRD. 

If it pleases the court I would like restitution from /u/sceptix.

It has been brought to our attention that this image has been crossing the surface of the web for nearly two years now, and that this boy is still in his childhood years at the ripe age of 14 going on 15. So if it is, in fact, his friend, then he *has* an interesting childhood, not had. 

Searching the defendants post history I find no further evidence of reposting, as he invests most of his odds in meme generators. However, there are submitted memes that tend to tell a story of our defendant. These include: [GGG Reposts](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/16gqlw/good_guy_redditor/) seems to proudly admit to reposting images, and [FWP Fridge Scenario](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/comments/13sdci/my_annoying_first_world_problems/) has the defendant worrying about where to put his leftovers in his packed fridge.

My name is Attorney Mozziestix, Esq. My offices fight for the rights of defendants in Karma Court. These folks range from victims of mistaken identity and over zealous white knighters to some of the most colossal douchbaggers imaginable.

That's right. Douchebaggers.

But, among this cast of characters are a few folks whose entire usernames were shattered because of a temporary lapse of judgement resulting in a guilty verdict of Douchbaggery. Yes, yes, you say, but the guilty must be punished! Indeed, friend, indeed. But are all deserving of the same Scarlet Letter?

I'm here today to introduce an idea for a new category of crime to help rehabilitate some first time offenders and save them the branding of a guilty verdict of Douchebaggery. Remember, friends, that with Dbaggery on their rapsheet, some of these folks can't even get a part time job making minumum karma at /r/AdviceAnimals - and those are 14 year old children!

If it pleases the court, I present for your consideration the following charge:

Misdemeanor Stick-bundling.

It has an implication that punishes the crime, yet it doesn't brand the person. The redditor, friends and neighbors, is left intact.

And it makes me laugh my arse off.

I have chosen to not bring the following case before the court, seeing as some of the fine and honorable members have decried a loss of the light-heartedness, however, perhaps it should be a consideration to future cases. Namely, a redditor has posted in reply to a depressed young man that the act of suicide might be a positive act to the rest of society. Distasteful, hurtful, and trollish, no doubt, but this is an offense of a much greater magnitude than any reposting could be ascribed.

And, so, the question, gentlemen,  is whether the above is a case that should be brought before the court, or do we endanger becoming a personal army by attempting to address a higher order of lawlessness?

I believe this is a mtter that will require some discussion, will certainly be controversial, but should be settled.

I present to you a case involving incredible photo conspiring to ascertain karma by going to extensive lengths in order to convince the people of reddit of the legitimacy of his photo.  


**Details**  
[This link](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1dmmvm/lightning_struck_my_friends_yard_yesterday_and/) was submitted to r/WTF with the title:  
&gt;""Lightning struck my friend's yard yesterday and left this monstrosity. What the hell is it?"".  

The picture in his link shows a very disturbing image of what appears to be a ball of worms that can only be compared to an alien-like creature. OP even comes back and comments:
&gt; An update: ""i just poked it, it's definitely rubbery/squishy. There appear to be no bones"".  
&gt; EDIT: Friend flipped it over and sent this pic of the back [http://imgur.com/fstfVYA](http://imgur.com/fstfVYA)  

His post was on the front page of r/WTF for quite some time, and his subsequent comment also was at the top of his post.

**Reasons for Charges**  
At first sight, the post (Exhibit A below) and its pictures (Exhibits B and C below) seem disturbing and worthy of r/WTF. However, by scrolling down on the comments, you will [find one](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1dmmvm/lightning_struck_my_friends_yard_yesterday_and/c9rt7gq) by u/JPEGz which claims OP's picture is acutally that of a simple hair ball (squeeze ball). You can see the stock picture in Exhibit D below. Upon closer investigation, it is quite arguable that OP's pictures are just that of a burnt hair ball that has been stretched out. Now, formal charges should be filed and he should face trial to determine his guilt in this possible conspiracy.

Clerk - [peter177](http://reddit.com/u/peter177)  
Jury - [REDACTED]

Defendant - [ben51959](http://reddit.com/u/ben51959) -- Defendant has been officially summoned to the courtroom as of 05/06/2013.
  
**Defense Opening Statements:**  
Ladies and gentleman of the court, I would like to present the defenses opening statement!
The case brought against my client, /u/ben51959 makes a mockery of this court! Gone, it seems, are the days when the prosecution brought **EVIDENCE** to a courtroom; instead **GUESSWORK** is all you need to press charges. My, oh my, I am utterly stunned that this case hasn't been thrown out of court by now.  

Let's look at the **facts**, shall we?  

/u/ben51959 posted 2 pictures, claiming that lightning struck his friends yard, creating the strange object you see.
/u/ben51959 then added two more pictures in the comments section, seeking further advice as to what the object was.  

From what I understand, the prosecution has suggested that the defendant, for the purposes of gaining karma, burnt a 'koosh ball', dug up a hole in a yard, placed the burnt koosh ball next to it, and claimed it was created by lightning. And where did they get this idea from? The comment section, here  

Now, for a defendant to be innocent there needs to be reasonable doubt that he has committed the crime. So, I would like to present some reasonable doubt:  

* How can it proven the object in question is a koosh ball? Could it not be any of other ideas suggested by /u/mjw5151, a user who has the same credentials as /u/JPEGz? (that being someone who has commented on the original post)  

* If it was a koosh ball, how can it be proven it wasn't struck by lightning? I resent the fact that the prosecution insinuates that if it were a koosh ball, /u/ben51959 must have burnt it himself. It could never be a freak occurrence caused by mother nature.  

* Someone else, /u/Revolutionizer, had a very similar thing happen to him. Note that in his comment history, he states that ""it's definitely a koosh ball"". So, if the object in question is proven to be a koosh ball, we have been shown hard evidence that lightning cannot be ruled out as the cause of melting, as there has been a precedent.  

The prosecution intends to find an innocent man guilty of a crime he did not commit. On what grounds, you ask? Well, by merely guessing so. That's all their case is based on, nothing but conjecture.  

That concludes the defenses opening statement.  
**Prosecution Opening Statement:**  
The prosecution respectfully calls bullshit on the defense statement.  
In the first photo, as pointed out by a commenter, you can easily see the ""little hangy bit"" that can be seen in this photo unburnt.  
The second photo really gives it away. As you can see, the rubber sphere on which the ""wormy-thingies"" are attached is clearly visible. You can see the ""wormy-thingies"" attached.  
Now, the question of whether or not it was struck by lightning. As /u/maynardftw points out, lightning is attracted to the tallest object. So why did it strike the ground right next to a tell, metal, lamppost and a tree?
And how likely is it that the second user's ball was also struck by lightning?  
The prosecution rests.

1367884680.0,11,self.KarmaCourt,1dtsuu,COMPLAINT AGAINST /U/H8FUQ FOR DOUCHEBAGGERY: LYING ABOUT POSSESSION OF A GRADUATE DEGREE IN THE FIELD OF DISCUSSION,BassoonHero,25,14,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1dtsuu/complaint_against_uh8fuq_for_douchebaggery_lying/,"### Complaint

Three days ago, /u/h8fuq claimed to possess ""a master's in economics"" in order to bolster his arguments in a discussion of economics. I believe that this claim was a spurious one, and that /u/h8fuq does not possess any such qualification. While some degree of puffery and self-aggrandizement is perhaps inevitable in such a lively sub as /r/politics, I feel that the wholesale fabrication of such credentials is highly inappropriate, and that the use of a phony graduate degree to claim authority in a debate constitutes the offense of Douchebaggery.

### Evidence

The evidence against /u/h8fuq is circumstantial, but nevertheless substantial.

- [Exhibit A](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1dm6nw/us_employers_add_165k_jobs_rate_falls_to_75/c9rqifr?context=3): In this comment, /u/h8fuq clearly claims to possess a Master's degree in the field of economics. The comment thread contains a sample of his argumentation, which falls far short of any reasonable standard for a certified expert in the subject.
- [Exhibit B](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/1dh8zl/til_the_us_marine_corps_is_older_than_the_united/c9qf6h9): Here, /u/h8fuq claims to ""have a master's"", but does not specify the field and does not use it as a claim of authority. This comment, however, proves that Exhibit A was not a one-time incident.
- [Exhibit C](http://www.reddit.com/user/h8fuq): /u/h8fuq's comment history paints a rather vivid picture. His comments hardly evince basic literacy, let alone years of advanced study in the social sciences.

The evidence clearly justifies the presumption, *prima facia*, that /u/h8fuq is does not possess the qualifications to which he pretends. This presumption may be rebutted by clear evidence to the contrary, viz.:

- A picture of /u/h8fuq's diploma, naming the degree and institution, with the name obscured by paper dated and marked ""/u/h8fuq""; OR
- Verbal submission of the type of degree and granting instutition, along with a brief summary and defense of /u/h8fuq's Master's thesis, in front of any neutral officer of this court qualified to evaluate it.

### Remedy

Should this court determine that /u/h8fuq did deliberately misrepresent his credentials, then I suggest nominal damages of one (1) downvote on the comment in which the false claim was made, plus a link in a child comment to the finding so that anyone reading the offending comment or investigating /u/h8fuq's alleged credentials may learn the truth of the matter.

Should the court determine that /u/h8fuq does possess a spurious ""Master's degree"" from an unaccredited institution or ""diploma mill"", then his assertions may be judged to be deliberately misleading, but not necessarily fraudulent. The court may or may not find this to constitute the offense of Douchebaggery.

Should the court find that /u/h8fuq does possess a *bona fide* Master's degree in economics from a legitimate institute of higher education, then he may have a claim for defamation. ~~If this court should find that I have acted inappropriately in these proceedings, or that I have acted with reckless disregard for the accuracy of my allegations, then I hereby waive my right under the rules of /r/politics to immunity from ""vote brigading"" insofar as this court may choose to levy downvote penalties.~~

Evidence:

[EXHIBIT A](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1k1a58/the_people_of_reddit_vs_rconspiratard_for_gross/)- The case in question. Just a quick look into how many upvotes and downvotes are being thrown around is a clear indication of my charges, with malice and hatred behind every downvote.


[EXHIBIT B](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1k1a58/the_people_of_reddit_vs_rconspiratard_for_gross/cbkwcvt) Collateral damage followed by clear contempt of court, as /u/TheGhostofDusty outlines the horrendous down votes, while /u/SilentNick3 chastises him for it.

[EXHIBIT C](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1k1a58/the_people_of_reddit_vs_rconspiratard_for_gross/cbklj0x) More downvotes for the plaintiff. 

[EXHIBIT D](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1k1a58/the_people_of_reddit_vs_rconspiratard_for_gross/cbkm0f8) Even More Downvotes in our hallowed courts

[EXHIBIT E](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1k1a58/the_people_of_reddit_vs_rconspiratard_for_gross/cbks0ip) It just keeps coming. ~~(That's what she said)~~

[EXHIBIT F](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1k1skp/the_mods_of_rconspiratard_have_been_summoned_to/) The first vote-gaming link from defendants

[EXHIBIT G](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1k3fbj/conspiracy_theorist_brings_karmacourt_case/) The second vote-gaming link from defendants (using a dormant sockpuppet)

Above is a shorted list of the atrocities committed, ignoring the original case and charges to begin with! Each of these indiscretions occurred within our courts, and that is unacceptable.

1366490849.0,10,self.KarmaCourt,1crf1v,"The Common-Law, rules of practice and procedure, and the administration of law: a few modest proposals.",Slobotic,12,2,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1crf1v/the_commonlaw_rules_of_practice_and_procedure_and/,"We need a comprehensive cannon of the common-law and of Karma Court Rules. I propose the following:

**A Canon of the Common-Law** I propose that a wiki be maintained with links to the record of certain cases. Cases deemed important to the common-law shall be organized therein and be referred to, henceforth, as ""published"" cases. Published cases shall have the effect of *stare decisis* which, though not absolutely binding, shall not be ignored without good cause and judges shall explain divergence from established precedent. Citations to unpublished cases shall be accepted by the Court for guidance.

(I realize that the majority of the world's legal systems are civil, not common law, and are in some ways fundamentally different. Civil law, however, is much more dependent on the legislature, a body of government which Reddit necessarily lacks.)

This canon should be navigable and broken generally into two sections:

Rules of Evidence and Procedure
Substantive Law Doctrine

Subsections should be according to specific issues. (e.g., offenses, sentencing, admissibility of evidence, jury charges, etc...)

**Intermediate Appellate Division**
Under Article II, § A, Paragraph 2 of our Constitution assures all parties to a dispute an inalienable right to appeal. That appeal, however, should be defined. An appeal is not a full retrial. An appeal to a higher court should be citing specific errors made by the lower court. The appellate bench shall decide whether error was made or not. If the Court determines, for example, that evidence used to convict a party should not have been considered by the Court because it was unreliable, inflammatory, or obtained in violation of Reddit policy, the Appellate Court should rule that the evidence be excluded and the case be retried at trial level. In deciding this type of issue, the Appellate Judge is therefore refining his work to the very useful task of promulgating rules. A rule might be, for example, that evidence that cannot be authenticated should be disregarded by the court, and because of that rule overturn a conviction and order retrial. This rule would be binding on all lower Courts, and have the effect of *stare decisis* on other Appellate judges. Appellate benches shall function as three judge panels. Two Judges in agreement shall have the power to speak for the court. A dissenting judge shall record his opinion and rationale therefore. A party who loses at the appellate level but has a dissenting opinion in his favor shall be given an appeal to the Supreme Court *as a matter of right* if desired. A party who loses to a unanimous opinion shall have a right to file a petition for certification to the Supreme Court which the Court may accept at its discretion.


**Supreme Court**
The Supreme Court shall be a body that functions as a 7 or 9 or 5 justice bench. (I prefer 7, and will use it as my model but 9 would be fine too). This does not mean that only 7 Supreme Court Justices will exist, but only 7 shall hear one case. To start, at least 7 justice must be appointed. In the future, an appellate judge shall be eligible to function as a Supreme Court Justice upon attaining credibility as a judge in the Appellate Division, just as judges shall only move to the Appellate Division upon attaining credibility as a fair trial judge.

The Supreme Court shall accept petitions for certification (I prefer this term to certiorari, but whatever). Petitions shall be granted whenever three out of seven (or four out of nine) justices vote in favor of hearing the case. Appeals to the Supreme Court, just as those to the Appellate Division, shall be issue specific. Rulings of the Supreme Court shall be binding on all lower courts.

**Closing**
In proposing the above I mean only to start a conversation.

In considering this, consider how ""real"" courts derive their power. They have power over citizens by extension of the power of a sovereign. We clearly lack that. But courts have another important base of power, one that protects them from other branches of government: rationale. When a court overturns an act of congress because it violates higher law, the constitution of their country, they run the risk of being ignored. Courts do not have armies, so why do the legislatures and governors and presidents obey them? Why don't they tell the court to go to hell and do what they want? 
I have no answer, but whatever it is, it is a base of power unique to judiciaries. 

Legitimacy lies in the rule of law, not the rule of politics or the rule of men. So let this Court be legitimate.

**EDIT: DL;DR?**

1. Create a library of case law as a reference guide. Run as a wiki.

2. Create an appellate court to provide appeals as guaranteed in KarmaCourt Const. Art. II, §A, ¶3.

3. Limit the jurisdiction of Appellate Division Court to the review of specific errors claimed by the lower court and for the creation of rules to remedy those errors. Appellate Courts are run by three judge panels, not just one. Two Judges can decide a case. If one judge dissents, you get a right to appeal further to the Supreme Court.

4. Create a Supreme Court. Seven Justice panel hear a case. Four justices may render a decision.

5. Supreme Court must take cases from Appellate Division where there was a dissenting judge. They may also grant direct certification (take the case straight from the trial court, cutting out the Appellate Division) to cases they deem to be urgent and important.

6. Redditers with 2000+ karma may serve as judge. Judge shall choose Appellate Division judges. Appellate Division judges shall choose Supreme Court justices. 

7. There may be more than 7 Supreme Court justices, but only seven shall ever work together on a single case.

8 Judges in panels who disagree with the majority shall record the reason for their dissent for the benefit of the common law.",,False,,t5_2v788,1366597766.0,,,True,t3_1crf1v,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1crf1v/the_commonlaw_rules_of_practice_and_procedure_and/,

However, left unchecked this small offense could very well have resulted in the down-voting of an innocent user....therefore I urge you to understand that Libel is not to be taken lightly. Many a reputation have been sullied by fewer words than this sentence contains. Now, without any further adieu: 

[The Post]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/17nzme/i_see_your_shaved_alpacas_and_raise_you_a_shaved/), which contains the dispute in question in the title itself. 
User dream2012 accused the OP hollywoodbob of claiming ownership of the image, rather, the shaved Guinea Pig that the image displays.
The defendant attempted to support his claims by providing a link to a Google image search of a shaved Guinea Pig.

[The Evidence](https://www.google.ca/webhp?bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;ech=1&amp;psi=J4ULUcXsOqzpiQKQ1oDwCg.1359709480272.1&amp;emsg=NCSR&amp;noj=1&amp;ei=J4ULUcXsOqzpiQKQ1oDwCg)
Upon examining the post and the evidence presented by the defendant, one can see that it is in fact the same Guinea Pig.
This could only mean that hollywoodbob indeed used the exact image of the first result in this search; however, this evidence does not support the defendant's initial claim.....the claim that hollywoodbob had stated that this was his very own Guinea Pig when in fact, this in not true.
For all I know, the user in question may very well own a Guinea Pig...but I am certain he never said that THIS one was his. The court would only need to closely examine the title, seeing as how it was hollywoodbob's own words: ""I see your shaved alpacas and raise you a shaved guinea pig.""
Now, before I continue it is relevant that I present an earlier post, with which was the reason for this shaved guinea pig image in the first place:

[That Picture](http://imgur.com/ecLq2HA)
My time is short but I will close with this: hollywoodbob simply wished to compare one shaved animal to another for some relevant karma, however, dream2012 accused his of claiming ownership of the guinea pig pictured. Here are the comments containing my defense, which provide adequate proof to my statements:

Upon [request for proofs](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ccbyn/stockbroker_ama/c9f8k1k) (exhibit A), defendant proceeded to claim proof had been submitted to the mods.  This claim was directly contradicted an hour later when the mods were contacted, and [put a stop to the AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ccbyn/stockbroker_ama/c9faisw) (exhibit B).  This lays the foundation for the charge of misdemeanor fraudulent misrepresentation, as Defendant had claimed to submit proof, yet the evidence makes clear that he had not.

Later in the AMA, defendant posted purported proof in the form of a business card with words substantially similar to 'hi reddit, IAMA broker' along with a link to a Google search for defendants alleged name IRL and the letters 'CRD'.  After searching for this individual in various broker registration databases, I determined this individual had only been a broker since 2011, in direct contradiction to their claim that they had been a broker [since 2007](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ccbyn/stockbroker_ama/c9f5ozm) (Exhibit C).  Furthermore, and in direct violation of FINRA Rules [2010](http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display.html?rbid=2403&amp;record_id=6905&amp;element_id=5504&amp;highlight=2010#r6905) and [2210](http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display.html?rbid=2403&amp;element_id=10648), defendant has previously [claimed to hold](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/wfhoa/eli5_what_on_earth_is_happening_on_the_floor_of/c5dc0i0) (exhibit D) several securities dealer licenses, including a series 3, series 4, series 24, and series 79 that his alleged IRL name does not hold.  Upon making [my concerns known](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ccbyn/stockbroker_ama/c9fbhlm) (exhibit E) in the IAMA, defendant requested I remove the personal information as it had been posted on accident.  For either submitting false proof for an IAMA, or for lying in an IAMA and elsewhere on reddit in violation of federal securities regulations, I submit this lays the foundation for a charge of felony shenanigans.

I, /u/bleekicker, attorney, president, reporter, and redditor, hereby summon the court to hear of this case I am pressing against /u/ALBERMAU5.

As seen in Exhibit A, ALBERMAU5 states in the history of him law firm that ""he tried releasing an article about the new subreddit in hopes to try to get it out there, he was quickly relieved of his duties as a reporter and shunned from the subreddit"". In reality, he tried to post a very, very biased commercial, advertising a spinoff subreddit of KarmaCourt. As we argued in the modmail, KarmaCourtGazette is supposed to be about *KARMA*Court.

Therefore, I charge him of defamation, for trying to make the face of me, and the gazette look bad for firing him.

I need your help in a few ways:

1. I need the bot to be added as a moderator in as many places as possible so it can do some damage. I can probably do that myself, but if you don't mind, message your local small subreddit and refer them to /u/blacklistr.

2. The next time you find a criminal guilty of a severe offense, send a message to /u/blacklistr, with a link to the thread in which they are found guilty. I'll ban them from *everywhere.*

As he claims, the defendant, in anticipation of his birthday, up and forgot said day fell upon Valentine's Day, and this year, the first he'd spent with his wife.

On its own, such an occurrence may sound unlikely, but this tale grows stranger when, as stated by the defendant, [they've been together for nine years](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/18jfr5/today_is_my_birthday_apparently_it_is_also/c8ff7o9). Far from me to judge, at least in the capacity of how a couple goes about its business, but the idea that it never occurred to him for Valentine's to coincide with the day of his birth in the nine years he was with his significant other was worth some wonder at the least.

I will refer you to [The People V. Leviitan](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/17lwaw/people_of_reddit_vs_uleviitan_for_pettyreposttxt) for context.

I would like the record to show that the post in question was deleted by moderator /u/light_twin of the accused sub-reddit, so there is little to no evidence to be displayed in the case. What you need know is that a 2010 illustrated cartoon picture of a pokemon was posted today claiming that a friend had drew it that day. Immediately, without hesitation, a downvote brigade was brought on by the users of this sub-reddit without even questioning the validity of the users claim.

I would love to believe that we all live in a world where our friends tell us the truth and only the truth and never ever lie, but that's not the case, boobs and gentlemen. Must we always worry about what we share with the Reddit Community? Must I always question my friends in the future? Shall I tell them I don't trust them all for the sake of an online community?

1 Year, 5 Months, 20 Days. 6 Submission. 5 Remain. Never has one of those submissions been to gain Karma. Never has /u/leviitan lied! If you look through the comments, you will find a pleasant reddit user, no a delightful person, that has come under the mercy of a hostile audience! Should I be surprised that it's a children's audience? Probably not, but it's time to grow up! 

I call for the denouncement of those in question. I request a formal apology for the treatment of my client while using their sub-reddit. Murder is what this is. They drove my client to retire this account in order to begin a new account. My client is receiving hate-PM's and downvotes of all comment karma. I call for the community to raise the karma bar and restore it to where it once stood. I call for new charges brought against any further blasphemer. I call for swift justice!

EDIT: If found guilty and unwilling to comply, I suggest a downvote brigade on the entirity of the pokemon sub-reddit.

EDIT II:  I move to drop charges against /u/Eduardog3000.

I would also like to supply further proof of the courts disorder with [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/17m3i4/i_represent_uleviitan_v_rpokemon_and/c86uktm) by our defendant.

However this goes farther than that. His heinous repost not only surpassed the original post in upvotes but the reposter took credit for making the gif. With that taken into consideration I would like to add charges of douchbaggery and false advertisement to the offences because of the general sleezy-ness of taking credit for anthers work and the fact that the title implies the reposter created the gif. in question while in fact he did not.

Just over a year ago, I, along with a couple friends, wanted to compile a grand homage to this most-excellent site.

Much to our gratitude and humility, our post soared to the position of /r/NSFW's #1 post of all-time, which included a brief period gracing the top of the front page. 
Sadly. just four months later we, and indeed the all of good users of reddit, fell victim to a case of capitol poster-fraud that reaches straight to the top of the /r/NSFW community.
Our hope in this trial, should conviction result, is that the accused be revealed as a perpetrator of acts of poster-fraud, claiming of others' work, identity fraud and a misuser of NSFW materials; and forthwith dealt with to the fullest reasonable extent of the bench's judgement.

Of note is that fellow moderator ""yourfriendlynn"" came to ""krista's"" defense--and like ""krista"", does not tell the truth, and seems to be a creepy male looking for girls to stalk.

In addition, ""yourfriendlynn"" writes the same way ""krista"" does, has a similar Flesch-Kincaid score, and, has similar writing style/grammar and syntax issues. And again: just seems creepy.

In summary: ""Krista"" posted pictures of an innocent women taken almost a decade ago, and stated that they were of ""her"".

""Krista"" and ""yourfriendlynn"", who is ""Krista"", started a creepy subreddit, ""bigirlsgonewild"", since they are too lazy and creepy just to browse posts like everyone else.

""krista"" does not say why his being a mod should have any impact on this being reposted--it's just weird and creepy.

""yourfriendlynn"" stated in a PM that ""krista"" would delete the fake photos, but didn't, and that ""krista"" would lose moderator status--but this did not happen either.

[Long exposures of fireflies just before dark](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17e727/long_exposure_of_fireflies_just_before_dark/) - posted just 7 hours ago yielded our defendant 2,500+ kp, but was posted only [4 MONTHS AGO](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/zkrmz/long_exposure_of_fireflies_just_before_dark/) by /u/Proteon


Then there's [Sunlight through the Surf](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/17e9eo/sunlight_through_the_surf/), posted 6 hours ago by our defendant and, gasp, [5 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/xm6so/sunlight_through_the_surf/) by /u/Proteon


There are at least 3 other pictures posted to /r/pics by our defendant with the same situation, only yielding less karma, so I suggest tacking on additional charges of PettyRepost.txt along with the charge of GrandTheft.jpg. What say you KarmaCourt? Shall he be summoned, and does anyone care to take his defense?

I have done some research and I have found that the only post he has made was, in fact, the Grand Theft of which we are discussing now. This looks like a classic ""repost and run"" case. I hope the Justices and Jurors will discuss this case appropriately.

A lot of reposters have been swarming around /r/AdviceAnimals in the past month. Many have reached the front page.

Ref: Case # 13KCC-08-1khbwo

---

(1). **Introduction**

Since its inception, /r/USMC has been a subreddit for current and past members of the US Marine Corps, where they can tell retarded inside jokes nobody else gets, make ""ZOMG TERMINAL LANCE"" posts, and gripe about ""Stolen Valor"". Recently, there has been a high volume of non-Marines making posts asking painfully uninformed questions that many subscribers find irritating. For this reason, /r/USMCBoot was created specifically for members who wanted to answer questions to service civilians who wanted to ask them. While most /r/USMC subscribers are not opposed to answering questions about life in the Corps, this setup is more conducive to having a sub with high quality content.

While serving as the Commanding Officer (ie, main moderator) of /r/USMC, /u/khrist was unresponsive in subscribers' pleas to help redirect unwanted traffic to this new sub, and only made a response after another Redditor petitioned to take control of the sub. While he was polite in his response, his actions did much to damage unit morale and undermine good order and discipline. /r/USMC is an inappropriate place for subreddit drama, and so it is necessary that this court be convened to give /u/khrist a good tarring and feathering.

Additionally, he allowed his Executive Officer (ie, the only other moderator) to desert his post (he has been inactive for several years) and has thus far refused to appoint another to replace him. For these reasons, the RJAG has determined that /u/khrist is unfit for command, and that a good public shaming is in order.

1364792382.0,5,self.KarmaCourt,1beksa,PEOPLE OF REDDIT VS /U/DARMON FOR ONE COUNT OF GROSS ABUSE OF FAKE INTERNET POWER,FictionalOrange,11,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1beksa/people_of_reddit_vs_udarmon_for_one_count_of/,"First, let me state that I don't know if this case can be tried in /r/karmacourt because the offense has nothing to do with karma. Rather, I'd like to bring a case against the accused (/u/darmon) for threatening to use moderator authority to punish people who downvoted him in another subreddit.

1. Background:
/u/darmon is a moderator on /r/gifs, one of the most popular subreddits in existence (over 500k subscribers), thereby giving him a great deal of fake internet power. Please note the sidebar in /r/gifs listing /u/darmon as a mod.

2. Offense:
Earlier today, /u/darmon posted in a rather unsuccessful comment in /r/nsfw (obviously this subreddit is not safe for work, so browse cautiously), which was subsequently downvoted into oblivion. The comment in question is [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/1bdfth/kayden/c9641wb). Seeing that his comment is crashing and burning, the accused then quickly comments [again](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/1bdfth/kayden/c964mmb), simultaneously complaining about reddit (read: downvotes) and threatening to use his moderator status against the downvoters.

3. Case:
I am a first time poster on /r/KarmaCourt so I am rather unfamiliar with the laws and statutes of this holy sphere of justice. Further, since the offense in question garnered the user no karma (and in fact got him downvoted) I am not sure whether or not this case is legitimate. On top of all this, I don't know if he is actually able to ban users who downvoted him or if there is any way to know who downvoted him, but I feel that the threat of such retribution is a crime itself. If moderators (especially moderators of the most used subreddits) are able to use the threat of a ban to promote their comments, then the proper, natural flow of karma would be disrupted. So, at the risk of being banned from /r/gifs, humbly present offer this case to the learned scholars of /r/karmacourt to adjudicate on both the legality of the case itself and the crime in question. Thank you.

[**##EXHIBIT A##**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ivd2n/eli5_is_there_a_difference_between_the_devil/)

It’s an early morning in ExplainLikeI’m5, a subreddit known for its track-record of high-quality posts and discussions. /u/VirginSacrifice creates a post titled “ELI5: Is there a difference between the Devil, Lucifer, Satan, Damian, etc.? What are they exactly?”. The post itself is a beautiful example of ELI5’s day-to-day content, it’s neutral enough for healthy discussion yet still specific enough for certain experts to have extensive knowledge on the subject.


[**##EXHIBIT B##**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ivd2n/eli5_is_there_a_difference_between_the_devil/cb8elnr)

/u/deep_sea2 was the first redditor to respond, leaving his own earnest, informed explanation, even dispelling OP’s misconception on the origins of ‘Damien’. It is not soon after that the defendant enters the thread, approximately 4:30am central time. 


[**##EXHIBIT C##**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ivd2n/eli5_is_there_a_difference_between_the_devil/cb8ets8)

The first words of out the defendant’s mouth:
*“The part about Satan and Devil isn't true but everything else is true.”*
Already, he has broken one of ELI5’s most well-known and well-respected rules:  the Walter Rule, “… Keep an open mind!”

He has also brushed with one of the more subtle rules, “Be Polite and Respectful”, by immediately stating that /u/deep_sea2’s reply was wrong without significant proof to back his accusation.

The defendant then goes on to describe his own ideas behind OP’s original question.
*“Not so sure on the origin of Satan but the Devil basically watches over Lucifer and all the other evil doers and punishes them. The Devil is gods creation.“* 

Defense may argue that his reply conforms to Paradise Lost's version of the devil, and may argue to bump this down to Misinformation of the Third Degree or even drop the charges all-together. I must insist the original charges stick:
*""The modern day devil that you see in media trying to get people to commit evil deeds and such is actually Lucifer. Because Lucificer has waged an eternal war against God and needs soldiers.""*

This statement by the defendant directly links the characters in Paradise Lost, a work of fiction, to the modern, real, world. This is textbook uninformation, and excuse me if I am overstepping, your honor, but any plea by the defense other than guilty is laughable.

[**##EXHIBIT D##**](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1ivd2n/eli5_is_there_a_difference_between_the_devil/cb8euqc)


Evidence that the defendant’s uninformation lead to the direct misinformation of the general public.
This is /u/Deep_Sea2’s comment to the defendant’s initial response, thanking the defendant for “clearing that up”, implying that he now accepts the defendant’s answer as reality.

******
The defendant presents as a 20-year-old, orphaned female living in Sweden. The prosecution shall attempt to prove that this Eleanor is not a person, but rather a bundle of sticks.

[Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/c2hhkPB.png)

In this series of posts, Eleanor establishes that her Mother died when she was 8, she's lived with her Aunt since then, and her younger brother and sister who are currently 11 moved to America and she hasn't contacted them since. 

###First, the prosecution will address the death of the parents.

[Exhibit B](http://i.imgur.com/IDecr2c.png)

Here she establishes the cause of death as heart failure most likely caused by obesity and drug use.

[Exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/CLxe1hc.png)

Here the cause of death is smoking. The court may assume that the defendant could be referring to smoking illicit drugs. However I would like to point out that this post was a response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/18faa3/why_i_quit_smoking/) thread which clearly indicates tobacco.

[Exhibit D](http://i.imgur.com/nurwxQu.png)

Here, both of her parents died of a drug overdose when she was 8.

###Second, the prosecution will address the siblings

Refer again to [Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/c2hhkPB.png), and [Exhibit C](http://i.imgur.com/CLxe1hc.png) The ages and times given indicate that her siblings were 3 months away from conception when her mother died.

[Exhibit E](http://i.imgur.com/2LxfEjL.png)

Here her brother is 5 when she's 7... and molesting him.

[Exhibit F](http://i.imgur.com/PLuHmYb.png) 

Here, she smokes an LCD laced blunt with her sister with whom she's had no contact for the last 12 years. She would've been 8 and her sister -1 during the smoking of said blunt.

###Third, the prosecution will address Country of Origin

[Exhibit G](http://i.imgur.com/CdvUkoK.png)

Eleanor is in Sweden here. Refer again to [Exhibit F](http://i.imgur.com/PLuHmYb.png), how many Swedes smoke blunts to celebrate the 4th of July... or celebrate the 4th of July at all for that matter.

[Exhibit F](http://www.reddit.com/user/EleanorTenenbaum/comments/#page=1) 

Peruse her comment history if you will for a moment. Take note, out of all her favorite movies, music, and TV shows, the only thing that isn't American is the Beatles. She even mentions ""That 70s Show,"" which has never been [broadcast](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_'70s_Show#International_broadcasts_of_U.S._version) in Sweden, and aired it's last show in America when she was just 13 years old.

###Finally, the prosecution will address the name.

[Exhibit G](http://i.imgur.com/X7B0fHf.png)

Here we are lead to believe that Eleanor is in fact her real name.

[Exhibit H](http://i.imgur.com/GELu1ra.png)

Here she claims that she'll name her first born daughter Eleanor after not herself, but after one Eleanor Lamb, who coincidentally inspired her username... along with it being her real name *cough* *cough*

###Conclusion

Given the body of evidence presented, the court must come to no other conclusion than chicanery tantamount to Capital Fraud. Given the gruesome nature of the crime, and the unabashed and numerous offenses, the prosecution must recommend the harshest punishment available: death by deletion.

MOD[S] OF /R/CONSPIRACY, ET AL FOR DOWNVOTE BRIGADING BY ANOTHER SUBREDDIT AND ARBITRARY BANISHMENT OF THE USER FROM /R/CONSPIRACY FOR LINK IN THE UNRELATED SUBREDDIT",bp_blew_up_the_gulf,27,23,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1cg96q/the_people_of_reddit_v_mods_of_rconspiracy_et_al/,"People of the Court, the plaintiff has the evidence to challenge the arbitrary ban by the /r/conspiracy moderator /u/9000sins, who witnessed my post in /r/gaming which contends, by argument on the basis of interpretation, the design and story theme of the computer game *Bioshock Infinite* as facially [Europhobic](http://en.metapedia.org/wiki/Europhobia), by the game designer Ken Levine and the staff, in /r/conspiratard, and decided to instate the ban from posting in /r/conspiracy, on the basis of ""anti-Semitism"" and ""racism,"" following the discovery by /r/conspiratard which led to the mass downvote by more than one hundred and fifty or so.

Presented is the exhibit:

# 1: The plaintiff's [post on /r/gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1b8biq/whats_wrong_with_this_artwork_from_bioshock/), titled ""What's wrong with this artwork from Bioshock Infinite? Answer: Jews' (Irrational Games co-founder Ken Levine) idea of video game as an indoctrination tool to promote attack of White culture, history and heritage.""

# 2: Approximately three days later, /r/conspiratard user /u/bigcooter discovered the plaintiff's post on /r/gaming and reported the existence of the post by [posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1bda2i/white_supremacists_find_jewish_conspiracy_in_new/), titled ""White supremacists find Jewish conspiracy in new bioshock game"", on /r/conspiratard. The /r/conspiratard user response was overwhelmingly negative. The negative reaction led to the influx of downvotes in an attempt to bury the plaintiff's post, even though the plaintiff's post failed to become popular by upvote after 24 hours expired. 

# 3: /r/conspiracy moderator, the defendant /u/9000sins, visited /r/conspiratard, reason unknown, and noticed the /r/conspiratard post referencing the plaintiff's /u/gaming post. 

The moderator 9000sins made the (hasty, the plaintiff believes) decision to banish the plaintiff, who posts under the username /u/bp_blew_up_the_gulf, from posting on /r/conspiracy, contrary to the stated policy of /r/conspiracy in the right sidebar, as follows:

**4. No stalking.**

**6. Bans are made by moderator consensus.**

The defendant has admitted his unilateral ban decision in the comment that was [subsequently deleted](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1bda2i/white_supremacists_find_jewish_conspiracy_in_new/c962uk8) after exposure by the witness /u/papadog. 

Witness Papadog [argued](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1bk9sh/9000sins_hangs_out_in_rconspiratard_preemptively/c97p2ve), unofficially in the defense of the plaintiff, the ban is unfair and arbitrary that breach the rule in the /r/conspiracy sidebar. Papadog's appeal did not persuade the defendant to see the error of his way and rescind the ban. 

# 4: The subsequently deleted [comment posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1bk9sh/9000sins_hangs_out_in_rconspiratard_preemptively/c97ms6f) by the defendant states the defendant's opinion to instate the ban by arbitrary judgement *outside* /r/conspiracy subreddit, provided by the source who may have salvaged the comment before its deletion.

# 5: The plaintiff's single, one-time post in /r/conspiracy, titled [""The False Death of Osama bin Laden - a Perfect Psyop Propaganda to promote the Gullibility of American Idiots""](http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/h43r2/the_false_death_of_osama_bin_laden_a_perfect/), posted over year ago, before the particular topic on /r/gaming was posted that saw controversy when the latter post caught /r/conspiratard users' attention, may have factored in the defendant's decision to instate the ban, stating the plaintiff is banned before he makes further contribution, referring to exhibit # 4. 

The plaintiff argues for the restoration of the posting and commenting rights in /r/conspiracy while conforming to the stated subreddit policy. Referring to exhibit #3, the defendant's ban decision is unfair and arbitrary that circumvent and likely violate the /r/conspiracy rules, particularly noting the prohibition of stalking (the defendant followed the ostensible anti-/r/conspiracy subreddit /r/conspiratard outside the /r/conspiracy subreddit and made the decision to ban the defendant from posting in /r/conspiracy, even though the defendant merely posted the topic commentary with a linked artwork in /r/gaming and do not in any way relate to /r/conspiracy except a single older post made on /r/conspiracy months prior) and moderator consensus, which implies the ban decision must be made by the few or several moderators of /r/conspiracy to ban the reddit user from contributing to /r/conspiracy in topic post and comment.

The plaintiff argues the downvote brigade by /r/conspiratard adversely affected the status of the referenced post that originated in /r/gaming. 

The plaintiff attempted to overturn the downvote by apprising the users of /r/whiterights to [voluntarily assist](http://www.reddit.com/r/WhiteRights/comments/1bgzl6/my_post_on_bioshock_infinite_as_antiwhite/) (the post titled ""My post on Bioshock Infinite as anti-white propaganda a few days ago baits the reaction by SRS-type libtards in the last 24 hours. Truth-troll achieved."") in upvote and comment support to counteract the mass downvote and negative, offensive, derogatory, libelous, scurrilous, obscene, and defamatory attacks in the comment thread perpetrated by /r/conspiratard users following discovery and posting on the /r/conspiratard subreddit.

The plaintiff seeks the remedy by the Karma Court by compelling the defendant to rescind the ban on grounds of breaching /r/conspiracy policy, referring to exhibit # 3 and rescind the downvote brigade by /r/conspiratard which attempted to bury the offending post, posted on the unrelated subreddit outside the scope of /r/conspiracy which is the supposed target of /r/conspiratard.

Prior to filing the complaint with the Karma Court, the plaintiff attempted to [expose](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bmpsv/rconspiracy_mod_arbitrarily_bans_the_poster_from/) the facts of the case on /r/subredditdrama, titled ""/r/Conspiracy mod arbitrarily bans the poster from /r/conspiracy subreddit based on the Bioshock Infinite ""Jew conspiracy"" post in /r/Gaming referenced by /r/Conspiratard, /r/Conspiracy users question abuse of power; mod deletes his comments to cover up"" with the requirement of no participation by related users involved in the saga, including the plaintiff and the defendant. 

The particular post, referenced in the preceding paragraph, was subsequently disabled and removed from the /r/subredditdrama/new page listing by the mod on [account](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/1bmpsv/rconspiracy_mod_arbitrarily_bans_the_poster_from/c982bgr) of attacking the moderator as being unacceptably defamatory ""vilifying"" the defendant as a moderator and, in his words, ""witch hunt-y"". 

In summary, the plaintiff argues for the restoration of the post and comment rights in /r/conspiracy because the defendant committed the abuse of power in denying the plaintiff the privilege based on the biased decision made by the defendant, /u/9000sins, to unilaterally ban the plaintiff from /r/conspiracy based on the negative impression of the plaintiff's post in an unrelated subreddit, which violates the /r/conspiracy policy prohibiting stalking and [disregarding] preference for moderator consensus on ban decision. 

The plaintiff argues the defendant acts in bad faith that should be the cause for concern in the Reddit culture, as the *de facto* censor who makes the arbitrary judgement influenced by personal bias in banning the plaintiff from contributing to /r/conspiracy, even though the plaintiff has neither intention nor plan to break the applicable rules outlined in the /r/conspiracy policy.

The plaintiff has the witness 'papadog' that will attest to the facts of the case against the defendant and /r/conspiratard downvote brigade who may have acted contrary to certain provisions of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and, in 9000sins' case, circumvented /r/conspiracy policy by acting unilaterally in his own interest to deny the plaintiff's post and comment rights in the /r/conspiracy subreddit based on unreasonable bias by rushed judgement.

I appeal this ruling on the basis that further arguments have yet to be presented.


1) At the time of this appeal, the content in question has received 495 more upvotes than downvotes. This would indicate a significant number of Redditors had not previously been exposed to this, and that a significant number also appreciated this post.


2) The inherent concept of /r/WTF is that emotion is evoked by the material therein. Given the evidence stated above, a significant number of Redditors felt this was an appropriate posting, and did indeed evoke an emotional response. The only question, therefore, is whether he violated the repost date standards. He did not, therefore ""Not Guilty"" can be the only verdict.

20 hours ago /u/hedges747 posted this [image](http://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/190q87/les_miserables_2012_540x811/) to /r/MoviePosterPorn  and has since gained 222 points a fairly large sum considering the average post on /r/MoviePosterPorn gets between 10-50 points henceforth making this a crime of repost.png if it is a repost.

It is a repost unfortunately. This can be shown by the fact /u/unkn0wn1 submitted the same image only a day before to /r/MoviePosterPorn as seen [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/18ziyc/les_miserables_2012_800x1200/) His post only got 15 points, microscopic to the  222 achieved by /u/hedges747.

also in /u/hedges747 repost he claimed the dimensions of the image (a required rule of the subreddit) to be ""[540x811]"" however 
according to imgur and my computer the image is actually 800x1200
imgur: i.imgur.com/NHky1Z7.jpg
my pc:i.imgur.com/nc8n3bl.jpg

Now some may claim that /u/hedges747 made a simple mistake in the title or something along the lines of that, then if that is true why is /u/unkn0wn1 post have the same dimensions?

Yes my fair court I type no lies, in /u/unkn0wn1 post he claims in [the title](http://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/18ziyc/les_miserables_2012_800x1200/) that the image is in fact ""800x1200"". a quick look to imgur can verify this.
Imgur: i.imgur.com/b235Q9W.jpg
My pc: i.imgur.com/4qA08th.jpg

I believe that /u/hedges747 lied about the dimensions in order to fool readers of /r/MoviePosterPorn into thinking it was a different post or he had used Photoshop skills to enlarge the image for their viewing pleasure 

In addition I have an eye witness testimony from /u/ModestEgg claiming it to be repost as well, as you can see [here in the comment thread of the post](http://www.reddit.com/r/MoviePosterPorn/comments/190q87/les_miserables_2012_540x811/c8jypvp)

In conclusion /u/hedges747 reposted a picture to /r/MoviePosterPorn that was originally submitted by /u/unkn0wn1 then changed the dimensions in the title (without actually changing the dimensions of the image at all) and then gained more than 10 times the amount of karma the original poster got.

Henceforth making /u/hedges747 guilty of repost.png (due it being a repost and gaining karma that's quite large for that subreddit) and False Advertisement due to the lies in the title that where created in an attempt to trick readers into thinking it was a different post or to make more recalling readers think it was an enlargement.

I am /u/19akhila99, I have been your Plaintiff and may god have mercy on /u/hedges747 soul.

The people want judges that are familiar with this subreddit and that are excited to be a part of it. Now some people are asking themselves: ""Why can't the mods be judges"". Well they are the original mods. They have to look over the subreddit. They do a hell of a lot to make this subreddit a lot more enjoyable to the people (keep in mind they never wanted a subreddit that got this serious, be thankful they're willing to do what the subscribers want).

I think that this can easily be a big thing on reddit, and with more viewers, and subscribers can shed more light on other perpetrators and thus more subscribers would lead to more down-votes for those found guilty of said crimes against Karma.
However, I do believe that there should be a rules and regulations on what is classified as right or wrong and what can be deemed as legitimate methods of gaining karma and what is considered wrong. I know Reddit's rules and regulations is a good method of deeming whether a person is innocent or guilty, however i think that if a moderator or a user would submit Regulations, almost like a book of law if you will, in order to make this seem fairer to the 'defendant' and make this place a bit more fun; with users being able to refer to sections and articles within this KarmaCourt book of Law. 

So my request is simple, if possible, and if somebody has enough dedication to this subreddit, could they please create some sort of 'book of reddit law' for this page, which could possibly bring more users to this subreddit and more importantly give everyone an solid impression of whether someone is guilty of such crimes or not.

While I am not prepared to bring a full complaint against /u/jij and /u/tuber at this time, nor can I claim to speak on behalf of any Reddit user other than myself, I would like to inquire if such a lawsuit is possible under the venerable Constitution of the Karma Court.  To my present knowledge, the venerable Constitution does not outline actions taken against Moderators.  This should not preclude the court from hearing such cases, as the absence of language pertaining to said actions does not indicate that action against Moderators is forbidden, and suggests, rather, that actions against moderators was not forseen when the original Constitution was drafted.  In the interest of setting precedent of action against all members of the Reddit communty, I humbly believe it is in the best interest of the Karma Court to consider such precedent.

As can be seen in the Saved Revision tab, there are two revisions to begin with, namely by ttimebomb and myself, followed by 28 revisions by an unnamed user, followed by 70 revisions by Drunken_Economist.

The first 2 acts of thievery involve /u/lesmax. Dudester69 obtained a picture of lesmax's cat and fibbed that it was his cat. He earned 24, 813 upvotes because of this post. The post does not only consist of stolen material, but also classifies as a repost since he posted the exact same material on 1/22/13. 

      Dudester69 also reposted material 12 hours ago with a picture of a skeleton decoration having unanimated sex with a teddy bear. From KarmaDecay's sources, this has been reposted once already, but it could have been reposted multiple times. This repost earned 3,417 up-votes. Dudester69 refused to admit to his internet crimes saying ""Its actually not so fuck off"" when Redditor /u/waterslinger commented ""This is probably a repost, just like all of your other posts jackass"".  
    
     Lastly, Dudester stated that he has a girlfriend, which commonly results in more karma. Seeing the other things Dudester has committed we can safely assume he has no girlfriend, and was karma whoring.

     Overall /u/Dudester69 committed 2 acts of stolen material, 2 acts of repost, and 1 act of Karma Whoring.

    I suggest that Mr. Dudester is to be suspended of his Karma. Dudester obviously is a troller because he committed multiple acts of cyber crimes while only being part of the Reddit community for 4 days. His name also appears to be troll like. If this perpetrator is not handled then he will be hazardous to the Reddit Community as a whole. Do you agree your honor?

In this post it shows a screenshot of the mod mail showing that i was working as a ""mole"" and that /u/andrewsmith1986 was useing his ""fame"" to try to swade people against many ""famous"" redditors, such as /u/shitty_watercolour, /u/the_horse_yeller, /u/Apostolate, and others, I can assure you this is all 100% false.  
I guess it would have started in /r/karmacourtgazette, where i was hired as a reporter, i was later fired for being a shitty reporter, i can not argue against this, i am not a writer and i only joined the subreddit because i was bored, and all that itself was fine.  
But i submitted a story to post about an Subreddit that was coming up that was suppose to be just like /r/karmacourt but more serious, for people who didnt want to joke around, soon after i was being called a traitor and a mole and saying that i was advertiseing, i say with 100 percent honesty that none of that was true, they thought i was trying to advertise the subreddit so it could ""overpower"" karmacourt, this is incredibly false, that itself kind of annoyed me, but not enough to get me mad, it was their opinion and i respect that, i was demodded (of course) and so on. everything goes as normal until i go onto /r/karmacourtgazette and see [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourtGazette/comments/1958pm/breaking_leaked_modmail_implicates_rkarmacourt/) post, I have checked through the entire mod mail, saw **nothing** even close to this, not only that, I couldnt even find a place where /u/andrewsmith1986 even messaged us. So i believe that the picture was faked, either useing inspect element on google chrome or firebug for firefox, I talked to the moderators about this, they said to give proof, so i [did](http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourtGazette/comments/1958pm/breaking_leaked_modmail_implicates_rkarmacourt/c8kzmnm)  
but they refused to show it to the people, they said it was not reliable, which itself is okay, but not even letting the people see and decide for themselves? I think that is stupid, I have been on /r/karmacourt for like 5 days and ive already been through, modding, demodding, bans, insults, threats, accusations and more, and frankly i thinnk it is pure ignorance for anyone to beleive this, i represented /u/the_horse_yeller in a case so why would i go against him? I messaged all the users that i was ""plotting against"" telling them my story, a few got back and i feel like they believe me. I am not trying to turn anyone against anyone, i am just trying to show people the truth, the people at /r/karmacourtgazette are either behind all the accusations or they are oblivious to the fact thats its all fake, i came up with a theory that i posted on a few threads to show people, i will post it here as well....  
.  
.  
I think that the whole post about us trying to get the ""power users"" to quit is a ""reverse"" to try to get us to quit, i mean look at it
.
They don't like /u/trolaway [+20] because you are the main person to call out /r/karmacourt so they have obvious beef about you starting the new subreddit because without karmacourt, their subreddit has nothing.
.
I was a Moderator of the gazette until they thought that i was working for the ""other team"" to try to get people away from karmacourt,
.
andrewsmith1986 is a ""power user"" so they can easily try to make it seem like he a ""attention thirsty""
.
and they could see how people would be interested in the new subreddit, so they are turning public opinion against us, so that we will quit in order to keep their subredit safe!
Im posting this in several posts to get my idea known.  
.  
.  
Now believe what you want, but i am here to try to show you the truth, i will be editing this from time to time, so ask questions if you got any.
