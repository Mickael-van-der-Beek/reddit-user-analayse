**Edit:**  Wow I had no idea this would blow up over the weekend. First of all, your President, the one that was elected by the majority of America (and from what I gather, most of you), actually EXPANDED the surveillance program. In essence, you elected someone that furthered the program. Now before you start saying that it was started under Bush, which is true (and no I didn't vote for Bush either, I'm 3rd party all the way), why did you then elect someone that would further the program you so oppose? Michael Hayden himself (who was a director in the NSA) has spoke to the many similarities between Bush and Obama relating to the NSA surveillance. Obama even went so far as to say that your privacy concerns were being addressed. In fact, it's also believed that several members of Congress KNEW about this as well. BTW, also people YOU elected. Now what can we do about this? Obviously vote them out of office if you are so concerned with your privacy. Will we? Most likely not. In fact, since 1964 the re-election of incumbent has been at 80% or above in every election for the House of Representatives. For the Sentate, the last time the re-election of incumbent's dropped below 79% was in 1986. (**Source:** http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/reelect.php). So most likely, while you sit here and complain that nothing is being done about your privacy concerns, you are going to continually vote the same people back into office. 

The other thing I'd like to say is, what is up with all the hate?!? For those of you saying ""people like you make me sick"" and ""how dare you believe that this is ok"" I have something to say to you. So what? I'm entitled to my opinion the same way you are entitled to your opinions. I'm sure that are some beliefs that you hold that may not necessarily be common place.

In such a society, men are tough, capable, providers, and protectors while women are fragile, vulnerable, provided for, and motherly (ie, the main parent). And since women are seen as property of men in a patriarchal society, sex is something men do and something that happens to women (because women lack autonomy). Every Mens Rights issue seems the result of these social expectations.

The trouble with divorces is that the children are much more likely to go to the mother because in a patriarchal society parenting is a woman's role. Also men end up paying ridiculous amounts in alimony because in a patriarchal society men are providers.

Male rape is marginalized and mocked because sex is something a man *does to* a woman, so A- men are supposed to want sex so it must not be that bad and B- being ""taken"" sexually is feminizing because sex is something thats ""taken"" from women according to patriarchy.

Men get drafted and die in wars because men are expected to be protectors and fighters. Casualty rates say ""including X number of women and children"" because men are expected to be protectors and fighters and therefor more expected to die in dangerous situations. 

It's socially acceptable for women to be somewhat masculine/boyish because thats a step up to a more powerful position. It's socially unacceptable for men to be feminine/girlish because thats a step down and femininity correlates with weakness/patheticness.

But more than that, it is the type of governmental behavior that Obama promised he would put a stop to when he took office. He also promised he would protect whistleblowers, but instead of giving Snowden the protection and respect he deserved for revealing a clearly illegal government program, Obama pursued him relentlessly.
  
On a recent Jay Leno appearance, it seemed as if President Obama (at worst) directly lied about many different aspects of the NSA's domestic spying, or (at best) was completely oblivious to the realities of the program. He stated that there is federal court oversight. While that may be *technically* true, from what I've heard the overseeing court has never once said no to a single NSA request, and has essentially given the NSA carte blanche. Furthermore, Obama said there was no spying on Americans. That is just simply untrue, as multiple sources have confirmed.
  
**Please understand:**  Though the constitutionality of the NSA domestic surveillance and the pursuit of Snowden are indirectly related to my CMV, the crux of my post is that Obama has both lied and failed to make good on his campaign promises in a huge way, and has therefore lost *credibility*.

The person, because of the media spreading their face, is now under threat from the general public. People who may have only seen the first headline and think they did it.

If a man is convicted of rape or murder of a child, then is proven innocent, already their face has been shown to people in that community.

Azaria Chamberlain, when I read a news article about it, was one of the most heart breaking of these. This poor mother lost her child, and was criticised for not showing enough emotion.

I don't believe that anyone (or nearly anyone, there's always the edge case) is genetically obese.  Due to nurture, we are taught poor eating habits, and through that nurture we have obese families.

I feel the overweight and obese tend to latch on to the easy answer too often, because they find the truth to be too overwhelming and perceive it to be too difficult and the road too long to traverse to get themselves to a healthy state.

I believe people have misconstrued the ""Health at Every Size"" phenomena to mean that there's no reason to ever lose weight and there are no immediate health risks associated with obesity.  I do not hate fat people, however I do feel that the obese have a societal obligation to improve their own health, as not only is it possible, but by choosing not to you burden the rest of society with the expenses required to accommodate your condition, such as scooters, specially crafted seats and tables, and in cramped quarters, a deadweight social loss in situations like airline seats.

CMV,ThrowingItAwayHard,901,230,266,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jocwx/i_think_the_culture_around_alcohol_is_extremely/,"To start of, I realize how difficult of an issue this is. Banning alcohol flat-out would only cause problems and probably more than I know of, but my opinion is that the 'culture' we have built around alcohol in western society (I'm Western European, if anyone's interested) is very toxic to our every day life and especially children growing up. 

My background preceding this view is, I think, important. So I'll start of with that. I grew up in a small village where alcohol and straight alcoholism is not treated as much of a big deal. In fact, people fail to recognize alcholism and problem-drinkers so extremely much that my own mother has grown up into extreme alcoholism without ever getting the help she has been needing for over at least 40 years. It has affected both herself and those close to her, including me. She has recently confessed to me that her problem had been going on for this long and that the people around her in her youth (my guess would be early 20's) thought her attitude towards alcohol was cool. 

This is not rare. Especially villages have the risk of getting into extreme alcoholism and though I know I live in one of the worst places when it come to this issue (I have actually looked at statistics), I think it does highlight in a hyperbolic way how toxic the culture we live in can be to many people. Having grown up with an alcoholic has made me very sensitive to the signs of alcoholism and I recognize it a lot easier than most. My offers of help would be dismissed and ridiculed.

People who don't drink are called 'straight-edge', but not in a good way. I have made my own conscious decision to not drink, because doing so would be triggering to me. I couldn't hang around people who drink or casually go to a party without it being forced on me. I have had people get legitimately angry at me for not drinking. I 'spoil the fun', I'm prude and I'm boring. I am apparently not allowed to have fun without getting drunk.

I think every one of you at least knows someone who has a problem with alcohol and maybe even had it themselves. In how many of those cases did these people have to get into an accident, have to go through something horrible before they would get help?

In my opinion, the way we glorify alcohol in the media contributes to how hard it is for these people to get help. Commercials for alcohol are full of objectification of women and machismo. They target people who naively buy into the image of the charming man who is succesful with women. Drinking away problems is almost encouraged in some cases. I am not completely against any positive portrayal of alcohol, but I think there's a great lack of nuance.

Having said all that, I am still open to opposing views and hope to see if anyone has any information I'm missing that might get me to change my view.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,False,,,True,t3_1jocwx,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jocwx/i_think_the_culture_around_alcohol_is_extremely/,

To clarify a few points I see recurring in your rebuttals:

1.  I understand and agree with all of the ways in which horses are useful/enjoyable to man while living.  I don't understand how so many see this as a reason to not breed horses for meat.  I don't mean that ALL horses HAVE to be killed and eaten, for Pete's sake.  People who want to can still keep horses for pleasure, work, riding, whatever.  Just like we have some fish as pets and others we eat.

2.  All of the issues with the safety/medical safety of it, I think, would be resolved it if were legal and able to be regulated, the way all other livestock processes are.  Are there places that treat animals inhumanely in their livestock processing?  Yes, but you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.  You penalize those who do wrong, and don't make generalizations.

3.  ""Well, AudgieD, why don't we eat cats and dogs then?""  Because nobody in the US wants to.  Horse meat is becoming an issue because there's a market for it.  So, obviously, somebody wants to eat it.

4.  ""Oh yeah, AudgieD, why don't we just eat humans then?""  If you aren't able to make a distinction between the value of human life and animals, you need more help than reddit can offer.  Also, put down the bath salts.

My view didn't do a 180, but maybe a 90 degree shift, which is a change. /u/meshugga was not the only one to help shape my view, but he was the first to meet me with an solution we both tentatively accepted.

My goal from the outset was to carve out a legal ""safe zone"" for men who did not want to be fathers. That safe zone was *always* intended to have criteria, and so a good 500 of these comments discussing men sleeping around or being serial fathers was always a red-herring to me. They were never who I was trying to protect.

I had hoped to have this legal safe zone extended until the window for abortion had closed. I had hoped this would be reasonable. Apparently, some women might feel some attachment to their unborn offspring. Women, amirite? /u/meshugga, /u/OakTable and /u/yangYing contribuited to my concession that this would present a whole host of problems, both with unscrupulous men, and the difficulty of the womans choice.

The position that I have settled on, and I believe is the closest approximation to ""fair"", would be the existence of pre-conception legal statements which include both a mans (un)willingness to become a father, and a womans (un)willingness to become a mother.

Since the chief concern in my experience has been A) women lying and going off the pill to ""trap"" a man into fatherhood, B) a partner who previously agreed they would get an abortion who then changes their mind upon pregnancy, I think this solution would at least offer an option to help men, and C) the consistence use of reasonable contraception failed.

This would obviously be socially awkward (as another use put it, a ""douchebag warning""), but I am more concerned about the existence of such a legal safe zone, than its social viability. I just want the option to be there, so in the event of the unfortunate, it can always be said ""well, you had that option to prevent this"".

I still believe that unattractiveness is a serious limitation, but I will say that I undervalued the negatives of being physically attractive, particularly over-objectification. Based on the comments, it has confirmed that attractiveness also becomes irrelevant at some point depending on how you measure success.

-------

To preface, this is not the rantings of an ugly troll who can't get a date - just so you know, yes I am below average but I've been in a wonderful relationship for five years with someone quite hot (I say that because she knows my reddit username - hi honey!), but that is not the main argument I am positing. I will be posting a lot of studies from my time in psychology, but the original reference is stored away in a pile of boxes. I will be updating with a digital link to the article over time, and if it is made available for public viewing.

The main focus of my view is physical attractiveness as a social capital. Without a doubt, there is a conscious and unconscious preference towards people are physically attractive, this goes for men, women, children and even [chickens](http://cogprints.org/5272/1/ghirlanda_jansson_enquist2002.pdf), so to an extent we are all shallow, at least on first impression; but this is often a pivotal stage for the continued success of any relationship. And yes there is a general guideline for physical attractiveness, while body-types may differ based on culture and upbringing, features (especially of the face) generally have a normality for attractiveness, the less you deviate from that ratio - the better.

I understand that attractive people are subject to certain prejudices, and I am aware that some of them are:

* Over-objectification
* Attractive people are viewed as less intelligent. There is an interesting study as well demonstrating an inverse relationship between the amount of skin shown and perceived intelligence.

But these issues are easily manageable, unattractive people however are prone to the serious issue of being invisible or dismissed. Like being born into a wealthy family, attractive people will always have better opportunities, pre-established social connections and status, will initially command more respect, the *potential* for more exposure to culture and education and a significantly easier time achieving long term goals due to the aforementioned.

* Because I have an ethnic name, I actually get a significantly reduced number of callbacks for interviews when using my legal name in my job application. I replicated this from a study that looked into the same issue, by creating two identities and using a neutral last name i.e. Smith, on the latter. I believe unattractive people face a similar problem of being able to get their foot through the door. Studies show that people will immediately notice the tallest person in a group, unless there is significant case of a person being short, e.g. dwarfism. Unattractive people are often overlooked, and people are less likely to remember them.
* Unattractive will have more issues regarding self-esteem. [The detriments of being complimented on physical appearance](http://www.nerve.com/scanner/2009/09/28/study-says-calling-women-pretty-makes-them-more-likely-to-reject-you) aside, not being viewed in a favourable light, especially in adolescent to early adulthood can have long lasting ramifications - especially when people learn that appearance plays a big role in success. There are things people can do to even the playing field - wear nice clothes, consider the significance of scent to desirability, the use of wit and rhetoric - but these are things EVERYONE has to consider. Adhering to these rules does not give you an edge over anyone else observing them as well.
* People are nicer to attractive people, whether they realize it or not. Studies show that we want approval from attractive people, because we implicitly believe that their opinion is of more value. Just to add a tangential point, having attractive friends, like in one study where participants were asked to rate people based on their Facebook friends, also improves people's perception of you. So being attractive actually helps those around you.
* Unattractive people will always have to try harder, this goes double if you're not-good-looking and are of an ethnicity that is not of the norm of your country/region.

Just to counter a likely argument I'll hear, I am aware character and virtue are more valuable traits in the long term. But my argument is the limitations set by a person's looks are much more difficult to overcome, create a massive gap in terms of social capitol assuming other variables remain constant, and is virtually permanent.

Sorry for the long post, but I wanted to be thorough with my argument, and I actually had several more points - but I think you get the gist.

EDIT: Wow, I did not expect this response. Thank you guys/gals. I was going to keep following the thread, but I ended up falling asleep.

Firstly, I'm glad we all agree that superficiality is common, but at the same time it is depressing by it's unanimous acceptance =/

Secondly I should **clarify the argument to allow for more responses**: Yes I am stating facts, but there is a reason I consider unattractiveness akin to low income. Wealthy upbringing will always have the potential for a better life, so that presents an existential problem to /u/WhyNotWhatsWrong query. If you haven't heard of it before, the term for a person who is poor and becomes wealthy is called a silver-tail; the issue with them is that they are never really ever accepted within their new community. This isn't a fact, this is one part of me that actually came to this conclusion without strong empirical evidence. While not directly related to low income situation ,I also wanted to point out that I mentioned that it is a permanent problem, to which to **there is no solution**, well technically there is one but it requires an entire rework of the architecture of the brain.

Furthermore, in my opinion the life of a dog is equal to that of another animal, such as goats, cows, chickens etc...

Lastly, yes in markets where dogs are eaten, the conditions are brutal. And that needs to be changed. The dogs should be killed humanely and in an efficient manner. The process should follow a strict code that ensures no cruelty (that can be prevented, obviously the act of killing is cruel but the method must not be cruel).

Also, I do indeed live in the US and I've been to a few states in different parts of the country which has very much informed this opinion.

1. Financially: Allowing more focused legislation on financial issues that plague specific areas of the country (ie better laws regarding farming and usage of land in the west versus proper business laws in the financial hubs in the east) would increase the likelihood that the government could actually help the economy. States can do this to a degree, but if the Fed decides that banks need $7 bil, Pennsylvania can't say no.

2. Culturally: This one is huge. Though people joke about this, it really is true that there is a massive cultural divide between different states in the country. If the more conservative southern states and the more liberal northeastern states didn't have come to mutual agreements regarding things like abortions, gay marriage, teaching of evolution in schools etc. I think both sides would be happier. Furthermore, in an ideal world, this would lessen the stress on politicians to cater to the majority and maybe we could actually pass real legislation as opposed to just naming buildings which is virtually all congress does now.

CMV!

Edit: Just to crystallize my point a bit further (and thanks to u/username_6916 for the comment which led to this), I think that weakening the federal government to increase the autonomy of the states would not maximize the state's potential. The only way to truly maximize a states potential is to minimize the scope of the superstate government so their legislation can be more targeted.

However, insurance companies charge different rates for different genders, based on the assumed risks.  Males pay more for car insurance, women pay more for medical insurance.

The increase in price for males (especially males under 25) has to do with males under 25 being the most represented group in car crashes.  Why isn't this considered profiling?  Being black doesn't make someone inherently more likely to be criminal on the individual level.  Why are companies allowed to assume that being male makes someone a riskier driver?

Women pay more for health insurance because of potential concerns involving birth control and pregnancy.  Why is this considered, from a legal standpoint, something that the insurer has a right to assume?  Why do single women who aren't on birth control have to pay as much as women on the pill who are sexually active, and what right does an insurance company have to know a woman's sexual activity?

Finally, I feel absolutely NO attraction to under-aged children or other species.

Now to my point. I genuinely believe that people being attracted to under-aged children or other species is just as much of a natural occurrence as homosexuality. In no other species besides homo-sapiens is age or species an issue in the matter of sex. Therefore, I don't believe that this attraction is any more 'curable' than homosexuality. I believe that the benefit of therapy is to have people suppress these urges and not act upon them as opposed to eliminating these urges altogether. I do not mean any disrespect to homosexuals but I genuinely do not see how pedophilia or zoophilia is any less natural than homosexuality.

For the record, I definitely think that therapy should continue to be conducted for people who have these attractions. These therapy sessions will benefit society and prevent these people from hurting animals or children. However, I do not believe that these therapy sessions will actually eliminate the attraction and therefore, these people will never become what society considers to be 'normal'. CMV.

Very few other professions seem to receive quite that level of reflexive, knee-jerk adoration. That especially includes the notion of being a ""veteran"", and the social effect that word has.

Example: John Doe enlisted because he was physically qualified enough to join, and liked the idea of having his college education paid for later on. That's fine, I'll never fault someone for wanting an education, but on those grounds alone, his status as a serviceman is not particularly heroic in my mind. This is especially true if he were to serve in a noncombatant or low-danger role. He's qualified and appreciates the compensation he's going to earn, which is not much different than the reasons most of us are in whatever career we chose. I would guess that there is a non-trivial amount of servicemen and -women who, for the most part, actually do view it as ""just a job"", possibly even some of those who are stationed in active combat zones. Could be totally wrong about that, I suppose.

Military service certainly poses a high chance of experiencing significant personal risk, but I don't consider it to be much more risk than that experienced by other dangerous careers like law enforcement or firefighting, or by serving as a medical/social/political worker in a dangerous area. (I'm thinking more along the lines of third-world countries in that last bit.) All other things being equal, I have more respect for and would be more ready to award the title of ""hero"" to the person who works in their local community to make things safer, or to help the poor, treat the ill, etc. 

I imagine some folks will lock onto that ""make things safer"" wording I just used, and say it applies equally to active military service. I have a hard time accepting that when, by appearances, we have very often been the aggressors or are just protecting our commercial interests. I'm sure there are some counter-examples, but they seem like they would be in the minority during the last decade or so. I haven't done the research to objectively know the following, but I feel like most of the humanitarian efforts made by the US towards other countries are not done via military presence.

In the interest of full disclosure, I have the added bias that I consider the recent wars the US has fought in the Middle East to have been unjust and ruinously expensive. Thus, I am already slightly disappointed in those who volunteer to actively fight for a cause I don't believe was moral or worthwhile. I'm deeply saddened to see us throwing away young peoples' lives and unbelievable sums of money on fixing problems that we probably shouldn't feel responsible for, instead of letting those young adults and that money be used to try to improve things within the US directly.

**Now, I am not for one second trying to say that there aren't any heroes in the military.** We hear their stories on the news all the time, and never get to hear about countless more. I'm just saying, when it comes to using that particular word, I wish we would give respect and praise only where it has actually been earned by true valor.

I've got plenty of veterans among my extended family, and several close friends who are active military personnel right now, and I have had this kind of discussion with a few of them prior to posting here. Most of them are very humble and unobtrusive about their own service, and several agreed with me that they don't think all soldiers are inherently heroic.

I honestly think it's making us weaker as a whole. It raises children to expect things to be handed to them, and that they can win without trying, and it encourages laziness and children acting like brats when they don't win. I think this is harmful, and that children need to be raised with the understanding that they may not always win, and that they should work harder so they can win. They tend to act out when they lose or don't get an award, even when they don't deserve one. I think this is a major problem with our society currently.

So when the first part introduces a bill on law A the second party will tack on law B in hopes that the first wants law A to pass so badly that they'll be willing to allow law B to slip through. A recent example was anti abortion legislation being grouped in with motorcycle safety laws.

I find this disruptive to the process. By forcing politicians to weigh the merits of completely unrelated issues against each other, the consideration given to individual issues is diluted and good laws get shot down to avoid the passing of bad, or vise versa. Change My View.

I couldn't find much information on it other than an [NPR](http://www.npr.org/2011/11/07/142016109/smile-youre-on-cop-camera) article. 

The only counters I can see are pretty much administrative. I think that the police should not get a guarantee that the tapes will not be looked over for infractions and that they should be randomly chosen for ""auditing."" I also think that if the officer is dealing someone, that person should have access to the video. 

Also, there's an argument regarding when an officer sees identification that it should be blurred out. While I agree, I feel this issue would not be very difficult and should be done alongside the proposal. 

Edit: I found some of these responses great. I hadn't thought of some of them at all. 

But I was under the impression that the footage would only be available to Internal Affairs and the citizen who requested it (and maybe the officer if he or she needed to make a statement as per the article) . I forgot to mention this. 

Edit 2: thank you guys. I have a lot to consider now. Many of you pointed out that this is similar to the NSA surveillance, which I think is incorrect. These are officers of the public, and their actions should not be private while interacting with the public. What I took away from this was mainly the following:

* The use of these cameras would most likely be taken advantage of. A higher ranking officer could use it to scrutinize the actions of an officer s/he did not like
* Officers would very much limit the ""warnings"" they give the public.
* The most important point to consider is that this is more of a ""quick fix"" than a solution. Whatever problems that cause the police to behave as though they are not public servants would remain. This problem is a mystery to me. It may be part of the police sub-culture, or the recruitment ( a redditor noted in a recent police video that some states have a **maximum** IQ for new officers)

CMV",tisbutme,471,63,480,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6krc/consent_given_while_drunk_is_still_consent/,"I realize this is a very loaded topic, but I really want to have some insights from the other side.

So, my opinion :

When people get drunk, they make the decision to give up their ability to behave in the way their not-drunk self would behave. This can manifest physically (not being able to walk straight), or mentally (kissing that ugly girl). Being drunk does not give you a magic pass to do whatever, and it won't count afterwards. Therefore, if you give consent while drunk (I know consent is a complicated thing, but for the moment, let's assume it's perfectly defined, and consent was given), you can't take it back the next morning while sober. You are also responsible for any other decision you take while drunk (driving, and getting into an accident, for exemple).

Furthermore, I think it's a very dangerous way of thinking, since it allows the false rape allegations we have all heard about, that ultimately work against the real rape victims (and of course, the poor people that go to prison for nothing). 

More importantly, I think my way of thinking would also promote to drink more responsibly, ie. either in more reasonnable quantities, or with someone ""safe"" to back you up and make sure you don't take decisions you would not take sober.


To be clear, I'm not talking about the cases where the drunk person is so drunk (s)he's passed out, or nearly so.

I also personnaly think it's an asshole move to prey on drunk people to have sex, but it's not a legal matter.

EDIT: Everyone, please stop downvoting the opinions you do not agree with, please answer with constructive arguments.

EDIT 2: For a clear(er?) summary of my opinion, see http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6krc/consent_given_while_drunk_is_still_consent/c943v48. (Hope he doesn't change it into ""I love hitler"")

EDIT 3: A quick list of argument I've heard (and i'm tired of answering to), which are either not true or I disagree with (with arguments):

* Sex is like a contract. No it's not, see http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1b6krc/consent_given_while_drunk_is_still_consent/c94g7nc
* You can easily see when someone is drunk, so you are predatory -&gt; No you can't, especially if you're drunk yourself. Anyway, this doesn't matter, as my opinion is you can give consent while drunk, which would make predation on drunk people legal, if assholish.
* The line from drunk to incapable of expressing non-consent is to difficult to determine -&gt; No it's not. If you can't physically say ""no"" or push away your partner, then you can't consent.
* Someone tried to argue that it was coercion to have sex with a drunk person ? -&gt; My definition of coercion must be different from theirs.
* If you lie to someone in order to sleep with them, it's rape through coercion -&gt; Again, not the same definition of coercion
* It's rape if the person knows they would not consent while they were sober -&gt; Except you can't know for sure someone wouldn't consent while sober, ever.
* You're a BAD VICTIM BLAMER, YOU JERK. No i'm not, i'm not blaming anyone, and I'm arguing there is no crime, and thus no victime, so I'm a BAD ~~VICTIM~~ ~~BLAMER~~, JERK at worst.

1372473364.0,405,self.changemyview,1hafxx,I believe that the Harry Potter series is lazy writing and shouldn't be as widely praised as it is/was. CMV.,ana_ng_,622,217,240,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hafxx/i_believe_that_the_harry_potter_series_is_lazy/,"First off, I'm thrilled that something got people excited about reading. I love reading! I'm glad that there's a series that so many people into or back into books (at least from what I've heard). 

That said, I have a few problems with the series. This is all from memory, and it's been a while, so I apologize for any factual inaccuracies.

0) I don't understand all the praise it gets. I've known PhDs in English Literature herald it as a brilliant and sublime work of fiction, and I don't get why.

1) It's a children's/young adult book series. While in itself that doesn't make it bad, it does tell me that it isn't meant to be a literary heavy-weight. I don't think that there's anything terribly good about the writing style, especially the first book or two. Stylistically, it's nothing special.

2) The struggle between good and evil is incredibly clear cut, with the exception of Snape's flip-flopping. Everything Voldemort does is bad, everything Harry does is good. Moral ambiguity only exists when you're repentant about being a 16 y.o. Death Eater or his parents. Harry gets all kinds of people hurt or killed. He wrecks a large portion of the Ministry of Magic. He cheated in a class, attacked Malfoy, and broke all sorts of school rules. And yet, Voldemort is never given a sympathetic side. There's no motivation for him to do what he does, other than to be the big bad enemy. Somehow that clears everything Harry does of all moral wrongdoing. Why not make Voldemort even slightly sympathetic? 

3) On a related note, I think Harry is a pretty terrible protagonist. As someone pointed out in a recent AskReddit thread, Harry doesn't do anything to try and improve his ability to fight Voldemort. He doesn't do anything with the Legilimency stuff just because he doesn't like Snape. He puts people in harm's way - he gets Sirius killed, he causes a Dementor to get sic'd on Dudley, George looses an ear, Moody gets killed, on and on. Like I said before, never a second thought given to it, because it's good because he's the protagonist. 

4) The writing seems lazy. Really? Harry is the only one who can defeat Voldemort because he's the Chosen One? Oh, his mother's love for him saves him from being killed repeatedly? Every year from the time he was *eleven*, Harry is able to beat the most powerful evil wizard ever? It's all just deus ex machina - his mother's love, Fawkes the phoenix and the Sorting Hat, the bond between the wands. Not to mention the oft-argued point that his friends do everything for him. I actually disagree slightly, since he does manage some stuff on his own, but it's because of the plot last second miracles that he's able to. But still, especially in the first book, it's all just other people doing things for him.

5) This ties into 4), but I feel it deserves it's own point. JK Rowling had the chance to pull off an amazing twist in the seventh book, or at least an interesting one, and she went the cliché way. Neville could have been the Chosen One, as much as I dislike that whole idea. He could've been the one all along that Voldemort was meant to kill or have some fate with, and *that's* why he couldn't kill Harry - it was the wrong baby. It was set up along the way, too, but then - BOOM! - mother's love. Or, at least, have Harry stay dead. The legacy of the Boy Who Lived becomes the Boy Who Died Saving Everyone's Bacon. That'd be at least an interesting ending. Yeah, it wouldn't have been the biggest surprise ever, but if she didn't have any further plans for the series, couldn't she pull it off as a slightly unusual ending?

I know a lot of this is has probably been argued before, but I've only ever seen ""He relied too much on his friends,"" which I don't fully agree with, and never seen anything about why it's considered such a good series.

**tl;dr: Everyone was all in a tizzy about a children's book with no real moral conflict and a bad protagonist who relies on plot devices and lazy writing to save him from an interesting ending.**

*Edit: I suppose it comes down to I expect too much of the series because of the hype. I'm not a fan of the way the series was wrapped up, but as HipsterToofer pointed out, that doesn't make it bad writing. Can't say I'm convinced, but I appreciate the perspective!*

*Edit 2: This got way more attention than I expected. I appreciate all the comments, and after reading them, I'm definitely going to go back and re-read the series.

He was guilty without trial, and the much-beloved hate rolled in upon him.  Reddit was flooded with articles on the event, some even going so far as to identify Zimmerman's address and family.

I had a nice upbringing with two loving parents, I have been very successful in my field, I've made plenty of friends and had lots of relationships (some fulfilling, some not).

However as far back as I can recall I don't think there's been a time where I wouldn't have taken the option to die and ""erase"" my time on earth. 

I haven't because my parents (and a few others I am close enough with) are still alive and I don't want to cause them that much suffering. But when my parents pass on and I can otherwise sever ties sufficiently with the world, I think suicide will be my best option (the only shame is I can't convince everyone I know to share this view).

I know life is rich and full of ups and downs. But to me riding the highs and lows seems pointless.

""Think of all the good times you don't know you'll have yet!""..Living seems like some strange type of masturbation. Even if I were to commit some grand act to improve the state of humankind..this too seems meaningless because my view is one I believe is appropriate for all human beings. It seems that life itself is fairly meaningless and because of this I see no reason to go on living due to spurts of endorphins and an evolutionarily cultivated inability to ""pull the trigger.""

This is not the most articulate post so feel free to ask for clarification if needed. But if you can, I'd love for you all to CMV.


EDIT: To those who are replying to say that my care for my family and friends contradicts my position, this may be true. However, it does not seem to refute the essence of my argument. I can only say that I am human and that these things ""seem"" important to me (albeit unfoundedly). This doesn't mean I don't believe what I'm saying, just that at the moment I cannot go through with it (this is a pretty natural conflict of opinion to develop in a conscious creature which is fundamentally an animal in nature). There are also many replies regarding ""making meaning."" To me (unless someone wants to expand and show me otherwise) this is a kind of vague platitude that doesn't carry much weight.  

However, a couple of comments have led to this modification/clarification: I suppose my view leads me to death rather than various types of activities some have listed (kids, fishing in Alaska, traveling the world, etc.) because fundamentally I have never been meaningfully happy enough to make it worthwhile. To me sarcasm24 got it right with ""being dead would be just as meaningless, but would also avoid all the toil that goes into a life that is, ultimately, meaningless."" I recognize that this is a point where others might say I need medication or a new outlook or some change that might make me happy. But to me it seems like virtually all lives will end up falling into the category sarcasm24 is laying out.

EDIT 2: Wow, lots of great responses here. Thanks for a constructive dialogue! I have a lot of work to get done this morning but I intend to go through all the replies here more thoroughly this afternoon. I really appreciate all the responses and am excited to read through them :)

EDIT 3: Some closing thoughts on this thread..I suppose my argument makes little sense if you could be happy enough. Meaninglessness may still be a problem, but suicide is only a solution if being alive is in some way difficult or upsetting. That said, it's too easy to dismiss this as something that can be fixed through medication (if you're depressed), pursuing your dreams, having good friends and good hobbies, etc.. I am still left feeling that most people on planet earth will never attain a level of happiness that makes life the better option.

Life is hard for almost everyone. And to me it's hard enough (again, for almost everyone) that suicide doesn't seem like an inherently poor choice. But this is very subjective. If you think you are having a good enough time, I hope you all continue to do so and continue to enjoy life!

The sole reason is because of your white privilege. Against abortion? The sole reason is your male privilege.

I should start this off my saying that I lived in a town in which most (i'd say at least 90% of all students) went to college after high school, whether it be community college or a liberal arts college or university.

The dumbest of the dumb in my high school class, kids who never tried at anything in school, didn't respect their teachers, didn't do homework, would walk out of classes almost every day, and (I know one of them well as a family friend) got all C's and D's in their classes are now attending either the Community College in my area, or are attending low grade liberal arts colleges.

I believe that (setting aside athletics, because that's a whole other issue and would only serve to complicate the discussion here) college/university (high education) exists for those who have proved themselves not only to *care* deeply about their education, but for those who have done well so far.

*Nearly everyone* in my high school class went to college, and I don't think that should be the case. Why does a high school student with C's and B's in non-challenging, non-honors classes on their transcript deserve to go to college? Even if it's a low grade liberal arts college?

To broaden my point even further, and move on to my second point, I think that the people who are going to crappy liberal arts colleges (colleges with an over 50% acceptance rate, you'd be surprised how many of these there are) and they end up doing jobs in which a college education really isn't necessary. They end up working for small businesses. They end up starting small businesses. They end up starting in the lowest rung of a bank or company or even still interning out of college.

If we didn't instill a the idea that everyone should go to college in to everyone's heads, these people wouldn't have to go to college to be competitive, and wouldn't have to waste four years getting an education that doesn't really apply toward what they're doing (and that they probably didn't even really care about, they just wanted to party) and could have started at these intro level positions right out of high school, or with some work experience under their belt. Which brings me to point 2...

**Point 2: The idea that everyone should go to college is preposterous and bad for society**

I know that, at least in my town, if you didn't go to college out of high school, it was embarrassing, not only for you but for your family as well. And I don't think that this should be the case. I think that if you decide to go to trade school, or work a low level job full time out of high school, that should be *totally fine* and you should have nothing to worry about.

This is what ends up happening when you have people convinced that they have to go to college out of high school:

* Low level, for-profit colleges spring up everywhere, willing to accept even the low-B, and C average students from high school and charge them boat loads of money per year for a not-so-good education.

* Low level high school students flood in to wherever they can get in to.

* The job market gets flooded with people who have college degrees, and even if they haven't really learned anything they whole time (which, trust me, many people aren't learning much at college) they have it on their resume and *make it impossible for anyone without a degree to get a job*.

* Students and their families are forced to take out students loans to pay their way through school, and more and more people are put in to debt for an education that doesn't really change much.

* The value of a college/university education gets diminished.

* And the only people who get a good deal out of this whole scenario are the low level institutions making bank off of insecure high school students and their families.

I really don't believe that a college should be allowed to exists if it has an above 50% acceptance rate. If you didn't try hard enough in school for your resume to have a better chance of getting you in to higher education than **the flipping of a coin** would, I don't think you should be going to college. And I don't think that those colleges should be taking students who clearly don't care about their education. What is the point of higher education if you're educating people who don't care about education? Shouldn't students have to prove they care about learning before you continue to educate them?

To start off, I'm female and 18 years of age. I lived in Asia most of my life and finally moved to the West a few years ago. I think I've experienced both the worst and the best of both worlds, including sexual abuse but despite those experience I'm certain that I don't have it worse than your average bloke.

Men are expected to look and act a certain way. Women are too, don't get me wrong, but a girl going full natural is strong and liberated, whereas a male who doesn't take (what's conventionally considered) good care of himself is ""gross"". In the same way, a girl acting, for want of a better word, ""frivolously"" is considered liberated and modern, whereas a guy with the same attitude to life could be seen as a sleazy asshole. 

I'm obviously aware of the fact that there are things like unequal pay and all sorts of workplace discriminations, but all in all, **girls are not suffering**. As far as I can see, guys have to take care of their woman while not oppressing her somehow at the same time and they're still expected to make the first move (let's be honest here, a vast majority of girls prefer being approached).

I do feel sorry for the guys, I think they're really struggling nowadays. My boyfriend was told that he's ""a patriarchy-enforcing oppressor"" because he looks out for my safety and supports the more traditional ways of treating a woman, i.e. opening doors, paying for all expenses, etc. 

There's all kinds of support out there for me. Hell, if I was to post in /r/relationships right now saying that my boyfriend was abusing me no one would even for a second doubt whether I was telling the truth or not. Not to mention the fact that the majority of folk out there don't even believe that males can get raped.

Of course I know that girls are still getting told what to wear by the media and the society, but is it so bad that we can't express ourselves? No. People will  judge you, but will they try to force your judgement upon you and make you do things you don't want? No. 
I believe that we need to stop being so sensitive and start realising that we don't have it bad here in the West. 

Okay, disclaimers and to summarise my post: 

* I'm not in any way bashing feminism and female suffrage.

* Women and men are on equal terms in the Western world. Neither is experiencing more hardships than the other.

* I'm not at all blaming the current situation on anyone or anything. Both men and women get judged really harshly and that's just a result of how our society is today.

I believe that this is a step in the right direction, but that it doesn't go far enough. I believe that all people's organs should be made available for donation, if required and healthy, when they die.

I believe this for a few reasons. Firstly, from a purely utilitarian viewpoint, I don't see how we can possibly justify not bringing as much good as possible from someone's death. If someone dies, and someone in the bed next to them requires their liver to be transplanted or they will also die, I don't see how anyone can justify not allowing them to have that liver transplanted into their body. If the shoe were on the other foot, I'm sure they would want that liver.

I don't see how a religious objection can be brought to the table, because what religion would want one of their followers to deny life to another human being if it is in their power to do so? If a religion believes that abortion is murder, then it should also believe that refusing an organ donation is murder.

* individual purchase and consumption of recreational drugs (provided one does not hurt anyone else due to the effects)

public nudity or fornication (providing there are no witnesses that have not consented)

* the consumption of pornography (not involving coercion)

* the absence of a seatbelt in a car 

I'm not saying the Government should condone the use of drugs, prostitution, or not wearing a seatbelt. What I *am* saying is I don't believe the government should have any say in what people do to themselves assuming it doesn't harm anyone, it isn't their job to make things they don't like illegal. If Someone wants to do meth, I don't think its the governments job to detain them. If someone decides they are willing to be a prostitute to make money, or a minor wants to sext their partner I really don't think the government has any reason to step in and punish them. The war on drugs (in the US at least) has been a huge failure, not only has it failed to dramatically lower instance of drug abuse but it has also put hundreds of thousands of Americans in the prison system. Minors have unregulated access to pretty much any illegal drug, more so than alcohol and tabacco which are regulated. 

I believe the government should regulate drugs, and prostitution. But aside from that people should have unregulated freedoms assuming they aren't hurting anyone.

In the United States, we are presented with a false dichotomy between right-wing ""corporatists"" and left-wing ""statists"", when both sides represent entrenched, powerful interests. The interests of both sides (corporations and government entities) are similarly at odds with those of the majority of the population, and in many cases the corporate interests and statist interests are literally the same people with the same agendas.

It is often argued that the role of democracy is to ensure that government works toward the common good, but this ignores an important fact: everyone has one vote, but some people have one vote and billions of dollars with which to influence government. Government will inevitably serve the interests of those who have one vote and billions of dollars over those who just have one vote.

The American right argues that state intervention in the economy and society as a whole is often immoral, unfair, and damaging -- I think this is correct. The American left argues that corporations have the same negative effects, and I think this is correct as well.

I think that the primary cause of this problem is the incestuous relationship between corporations and government (""K Street""), but I also think that further regulations on government behavior to limit this kind of corruption would be necessarily ineffective, due to the intrinsic connection between wealth and political power.

The politics here are hugely simplified and almost every party promises an Islamic republic, yet no one knows whether they are proponents of a free market, protected trade, civil rights. Whether they are socialist or capitalist. But everywhere, on television, billboards and posters, they promise things like 'no blackouts' (the past month, the average electricity per day was only 8 hours in the cities. The situation although a bit better has been like this for more than a decade and promises are made every month.)

Riots and killings of political candidates are common here by the same uneducated people and religious bigots and these people vote only due to family loyalties. 

Two of the most famous candidates and the current incumbent of the provincial government of Punjab has been involved in financial scandals, where the wealth of many Pakistanis was destroyed. His niece called her guards and beat a poor sweeper just because he wouldn't give her a cake late at night because the bakery was closed and he couldn't go inside. His nephew tortured and beat his wife and he holds a position of power here. 

I must also mention that many of the members of the National Assembly have been disqualified because they hadn't graduated from a university. They did not have the faintest idea of political science of what a state consists, yet they were able to win their seats  

Thus, I have come to believe that the vote of the uneducated person must only be counted at a 0.5 score. The person who has passed high school, his vote should be counted at a 0.65 score. While the university graduate would have his vote counted at the score of 1. Having a doctorate gives another bonus, with the score being 1.1. 

This is due to the fact that the educated person will better be able to gauge the intentions and abilities of the candidates. While, the uneducated masses will not hold as much sway and the politicians would have to make an effort to appeal to the educated classes.

Their books are written for a popular audience and attempt to challenge certain religious dogmas.  However, most of these books include discussions of things far outside the expertise of the authors, and they end up making fallacious arguments.  Note that I am an atheist, and am not arguing for religion.

Some specific examples; Sam Harris is one of the worst offenders.  His book *The Moral Landscape* claimed that science could provide objective answers to moral questions.  By his own admission, however, Harris didn't engage with the relevant literature in philosophy on the subject, and instead simply assumed many things rather than establishing them.  Readers of his book are therefore unaware of the long history of thought on ethical systems and the differences between them, thinking that Harris' own Utilitarianism is obvious and natural.

Harris also, in *The End of Faith* argues for a causal relationship between faith and terrorism.  However, he looks at the current historical moment with Islamic terrorism as if it is natural and inevitable, and ignores all counterexamples (the IRA, the LTTE, etc.)  He presents a simple narrative of terrorism (more religiosity = higher propensity for terrorism) that ignores the complex social, cultural, and political factors that go into this phenomenon.

I'm singling out Harris, but Krauss and Dawkins both fail to engage with philosophy in any significant manner, even when it is relevant to what they're writing about, and Hitchens, like Harris, ignores broader historical considerations in lieu of a simple narrative - Islam creates terrorism.

The only arguments I've heard against GMOs are ones of ignorance.

* People say we don't know how a gene will be expressed in a different organism. But we do. We know exactly how it will be expressed because all protein sequencing in eukaryotes works in the same way.

* GMOs give people the ability to grow massive amounts of food more efficiently than non-GMO crops.

* GMO crops are cheaper in the long run because you don't have to buy pesticides to have them flourish.

* Rice has been modified to provide vitamin A to people who are too poor to get enough normally. Other vitamins and amino acids could easily be added to crops to end nutrient deficiency across the world. [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice)

* By putting antifreeze into potatoes you can get them to grow in places that they normally don't. Insert joke about Latvia finally having enough potatoes but to an extent it is true. [source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9349256)

* Monsanto gives GMOs a bad name because of their business practices but the idea of GMOs is not dangerous.

* GMOs are tested by the FDA but I don't see these people lobbying against prescription medicines.

* An argument against GMOs is that we are ""playing God"". Besides the fact that this is a stupid argument that cannot be argued against because it is religious in nature, humans have been ""playing God"" for thousands of years. Domesticated animals are a human creation. Selectively breeding crops to produce the best yield is altering a plants ""natural evolution"".

I have only heard arguments made by the group of protesters outside my local supermarket who want all GMOs banned so maybe I am only hearing ones that I don't agree with.

EDIT: Many people have pointed out that there is in fact enough food to go around, we just don't distribute it equally. Well if crops were modified to be able to grow in different climates then you wouldn't need to distribute your food because it could be grown anywhere.

* They are white -- which, whether we like to admit it or not, is still a massive advantage in Western society. People automatically assume that you are smarter and more trustworthy just because you are white.

* They are attractive women -- I know that the counter argument for this can be phrased along the lines of ""women don't lead better lives just because men desire them."" And, to an extent, I get that. But we really can't deny that attractive women enjoy a lot of ""free"" things that the rest of society doesn't; things that, when added up, probably equal a fair amount of money. There's also the counterargument that models (say) are more insecure than more average people. But I consider ""I feel insecure"" (which we all do, every single one of us) to be a pretty damn poor excuse for being able to charm basically anyone.

* They are women in a society which is quickly changing to favor women -- Society today caters to women's needs. And, yes, it is true that women still get paid less than men, and so on. But more women graduate from college now than men, almost twice as many; girls do better in school than boys; scholarships exist for women to pursue male-heavy fields -- so in ten years I think the world will be much different. I also think that the world today encourages women to talk about their issues (male-female rape) while discouraging men to talk about their issues. 

I'm happy to provide much more information about my view.

Am I being too cynical or snobby? I'm not saying most people are dumb, I'm saying that most of them have not studied the issues (or candidates) enough to make a fully informed, rational decision. 

Instead we vote based on 'general impressions' (which the candidates carefully manufacture) and the party we identify with.

We do this because the [alternative is a ton of work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ignorance), and it's hard to justify that much work just to get enough info to cast a single vote, one which will be lost in a sea of uninformed votes and will therefore be made meaningless. 

It seems to me that most important political issues are hopelessly complex. I'm not even confident a longtime politician who graduated from an ivy league school understands them completely. How can I talk intelligently about the economy... when I have no secondary education in this extremely complicated topic? I don't think I even took any sort of econ class in high school. So how can I debate intelligently about whether a new tax is good or bad?

It seems like everyone has a strong opinion about who should be president. But how many of them:

- Checked the candidate's voting record on all the topics they care about?
- Studied the laws, policies, taxes or programs the candidate enacted?
- Has sufficient knowledge of the legal system, economics, foreign policy, etc. to judge whether these laws, policies, taxes, or programs are good, bad, ineffective, useful, etc.?
- Did research into his personal life to ensure that this person has some sort of moral compass and their ability to make decisions isn't being compromised by drugs, bribes, blackmail, or something else?

I just honestly feel like the entire election process is a farce and most people are arguing from a completely ignorant point of view. Most people just vote right down the party line. And a lot of them will just pick the same party line as their parents.

CMV.,Inherencyftw,420,103,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gkvdj/i_believe_there_is_a_very_real_and_ongoing_class/,"I firmly believe that there is an undeniable class war between ""Proletariate"" and the ""Bourgeoisie"" IN THE UNITED STATES. Fantastic imagery for this struggle came out of the Occupy movement: 99% vs. 1% -- however in all actuality the ruling elite is more like 1/8th of 1% comprising of Hedge Fund Managers, CEO's of financial corporations, leaders of the Federal Reserve, etc... This war isn't limited to a single facet of policies or means of production but rather I'd argue that this war is one of monolithic proportions ranging from the failing education system to the oil dominated energy sector. For arguments sake I'll focus on 3 different points of confrontation: education, broad economic factors, and environmental/energy based policies.

1. Education. The American education system is a factory; most specifically primary and secondary education (think Kindergaten through High School). A consistent theme can be seen throughout the style of ""Educating""  that creates a very transparent dichotomy between student and teacher. It is the teachers job to ""Fill the students with knowledge"" while the students must sit docile in the classroom and be filled like an empty container. This enforces the idea that the students don't know anything and aren't capable of any sort of educational discourse based off of their own experiences or critical observations and require someone (the teacher) to gift them with knowledge. Furthermore the education system isn't set up to teach critical thinking, effective dialoging, or really true (liberating) education at all -- but rather to create an effective and efficient workforce out of the upcoming generation. I think that this is most transparent in High School -- the subjects are splintered so that science doesn't relate to history, language doesn't relate to social studies or math, etc... In essence High School is compartmentalized to be an efficient means to give students their standardized stamp of approval so that they may get a well paying job and bolster the workforce. Why is all of this problematic? It comes down this: The eduction system is created to domesticate the masses while squashing critical thinking and social awareness. Oh ya.. and how could I forget who lobbies for framing educational policies? The Corporate world whom have profited literally billions of dollars while effectively not teaching students anything (even within the paradigm of the education-factory system); see No Child Left Behind. The results are truly ""LOL"" worthy.

2. Economic Policies. This issue is massive so I'll focus specifically on taxation. Putting aside political ideologies of ""Big Government"" and ""Small Government"", I believe taxation is more of an economic factor than a political one. Who consistently lobbies for lower taxation? The Corporate, that's who. The reason is fairly obvious -- if we give less money to the government we give more money to business. In this instance (and like most instances) money is synonymous with control and power. Take the healthcare system for instance; the majority of it is privatized -- which effectively means that our nations healthcare system is a system made for profit, not for the health of the people. I think that in this instance the healthcare system is a sufficient microcosm of what I'm trying to get at -- in general when there is a higher rate of taxation the people will rely less on the private sector and ergo give less money (remember: control and power) because the government is able to provide those necessities rather than making them commodities like they are now. When necessities like health care become a commodity that we can choose how well we our health is  protected by how much money we spend we've gone horribly wrong.

3. Energy. Ever heard of the Petrodollar? In 1975 Henry Kissenger went to Saudia Arabia and effectively made an agreement that OPEC will trade oil solely in the form of the USD. Who controls the USD? The Federal Reserve... oh ya.. those old guys are the people on top of the top of the 1%. This affects absolutely every aspect of our lives from public transportation to food production. I'd argue the reason why America doesn't have a strong public transportation system using high speed railways is that are incredibly efficient and safe and that they run off of (generally) electromagnetic and solar energy; not oil. This means less profit for the oil industry and ergo less power the the USD has -- in turn less power the elite of the elites would have.

All in all I think that regardless if you might disagree with a point or two that a class war is undeniable. The 1% don't care about the well being of the lower or even middle socio-economic class, as a result we are treated like dumb animals that need to be domesticated and put to work to make them more money and give them more power. I realize this might seem like an incredibly cynical point of view but I don't think that the struggle is hopeless and only requires and active critical engagement and an ongoing praxis of liberation -- but that is a discussion for another time. :)

tl;dr: The people who control money are seriously messed up and are waging a merciless and savage war on the people. Change my view.

**Edit:** Due to /u/KaiseRoth and /u/B8foPIlIlllvvvvvv I have ""Changed My View"" on point 3.  I no longer believe that the 1% directly use oil to control and oppress, but rather that is just what the circumstances came out to be due to availability and US Hegemony post-WW2.

Now, at least according to that film, the culture itself is generated in a test tube by men in suits to satisfy an agenda. ""Artists"" are following a formula to maximize exposure and popularity, and the end-goal is to get people to exchange their money for it.

At the same time, there doesn't appear to be any real government oversight into what happens in this area. These people have become frightfully efficient in what they do with the continuously expanding understanding of how the brain works, but it doesn't seem that there's a lot of research in the effect it's having on the targeted consumers.

For lack of a better word, the culture in question is propaganda, not created by a government but by private entities for the sole purpose of consuming it and with consumption being the end-goal. Given how the culture a person is exposed to affects their world-view and who knows what else, I'm concerned that feeding them an artificial culture created in factory conditions may do irreparable harm to their psyche. 

Now of course history is full of examples of propaganda like this, be it from a church or wealthy patrons paying artists, never before though has the process been combined with science to be so efficient.

I believe that NoFap is no different than waiting for marriage, which is a whole different CMV, in the way it denies human beings their desire to find physical communication with others, explore their own sexualities, and understand the other sex.


I believe that self-denial is dangerous, unhealthy, and unrealistic.

-------------------------
**Here is a recent example:**

Recently, in my hometown of Lafayette, Louisiana, there was a LGBT flag flown in a public park where several other kinds of flags are flown on a regular basis. Needless to say, there was a lot of uproar about this flag, and the newspaper quoted a disgruntled veteran as saying, *“I did not go overseas and fight for our country so that we could come back and be subject to something like that"".* [sic] Now, a Louisiana Republican is going to pass legislation to ban all non-government flags from flying there. *While the ban is not inherently anti-gay, the motives most certainly are*, and that is something to be ashamed of.

&gt;“It wasn’t intended to insult or hurt anyone.” Amanda Kelley responded to Green that members of Acadiana OUTspoken Alliance are also veterans, pointing out, “We fought for this country too.” 


*“Several of us feel that the flying of this flag is a poke in the eye of a way of life. That has offended many, many, many veterans. It offended me.”* This is another exert from the news story, showing how people somehow believe that if something offends a group of veterans, then it must be wrong. But there are also veterans in the LGBT community, right here in Lafayette. If there is some kind of holy protection for the opinions and feelings for veterans, then why do we choose the straight, anti-gay veterans' feelings over the LGBT veterans? I think it all boils down to lazy thinking; people are anti-gay and they don't have any justification for it, so they use veteran-ship.

    • Premise 2: People who show a pattern of disrespect do not deserve respect.

Anytime someone uses this excuse (whether in a conversation with me, or in a newspaper), I instantly lose respect for them.

Thanks to the people who commented though. It will make a big difference in the real world I'm sure. Also, I have a daughter, which means that now she will benefit throughout her life from not having Daddy's asshole opinion about a topic that is relevant to many many people. Thanks for doing my parenting for me, suckers**

I hold this view because I believe that weight and it's various consequences, disease or the lack of it, are a part of personal hygiene. Some people find it difficult to lose weight for many reasons. I get that. I fucking despise working out until I finish doing it. It's awful stuff, I'd much rather be doing other less strenuous shit. But I still do it anyway because even though I'm not built like a brick shit-house (Australian for big and tough) I still find that it maintains the shape of my body. 

If I didn't work out then I would get fat or at least start looking pretty sloppy i.e. gut etc. But When that starts to happen I eat a little better and work-out and do my best to pull away from being fat or obese. If I didn't have showers twice a day I would stink. It sucks. People don't think I smell bad but it's because I put in the effort to shower when I wake up and before I go to sleep. If I didn't I would stink and people would react accordingly. If I stank enough to need 3 showers then I would do my best to do so. Even if there was a trend running in the wealthier parts of the world where more people were stinking, I would still try to shower enough. I wouldn't just accept it. 

Please, if anyone is thinking of posting an argument saying that ""it's really hard for some people"", or anything close to that, do not do it. I get for a select few, weight must be impossible to lose. We are human, some people are born with hearts out of their fucking chest, I'm sure some people just literally can't lose weight. But I don't believe all the fat people here in Australia and America should even think about asking to not be teased or ridiculed. Obviously, I don't advocate street rallies against the fatties. I'm just saying that as far as people would normally ridicule stinky people or dirty people then so should that level of ridicule be due obese people. Some people stink more and so they have to shower more. Some people gain weight quicker or faster or easier and so they should be more healthy and work out harder to avoid being fat -- otherwise they are fair game. CMV. 

I am sorry a little bit if I come off sounding like an asshole. I'm not that sorry, but I am mildly apologetic despite it being my intention. I just am curious to see if people can CMV on seeing the broad obesity ""problem"" in the West as a personal hygiene failing. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE PEOPLE NOT TO TRY TO CMV BY CITING THEIR FAT COUSIN OR FAT-SELVES WHO HAVE A DISEASE DISALLOWING FAT LOSS OR EXERCISE.

Libertarian ideas don't account for that imbalance in changing private sector wages.

Radical free-market capitalism fails to provide for the needs of a society. Eventually, it becomes exploitative and inhumane. Libertarian ideas assume that the ""job creators"" at the top have some incentive to create jobs, like they *want* to create jobs, or that paying their workers well helps them in some way. If they can get away with lower wages, they will pay lower wages. If they can exploit their workers, they will. And this is inevitable in a capitalist system. The only value added is that of human labor. What incentive is there to not exploit human labor in a completely free market?

How is rational self interest acceptable? Doesn't it lead to the exploitation of other people? Doesn't a lack of social programs harm a society, increase poverty and crime, and hurt everyone in the end? Wouldn't the absence of a ""floor"" of poverty cause the entire society to collapse? How is it okay to forget about people who need help?

Lots of people consider having children a fundamental biological right. That's fine, but why not counsel people to wait to do it until they're, say, 28 and have a better job, rather than have the kid at age 22 and struggle to survive?

Note, I'm not in any way saying that we should take away benefits for poor families with kids. That would be cruel. I'm just asking why we don't do more to educate people who can't support children on why it would be better not to?

1372360646.0,279,self.changemyview,1h749v,I believe assisted suicide should be legalized and that the fact it isn't is an infringement on those individuals' free choice. CMV.,Jazzematics,341,62,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h749v/i_believe_assisted_suicide_should_be_legalized/,"Like the title says, I think assisted suicide should be legal. It's honestly a little boggling to me why it is so incredibly controversial. The arguments pro are a little self-explanatory I think (free choice, etc.) Instead, I've tried to summarize and rebut some arguments from the opposing side, which I've boiled down to this:

- Often, the request of death has a lot to do with the loss of certain bodily functions and the accompanying loss of dignity. The argument is often people are extremely despondent initially regarding a loss of limb or sense, but often come to realize they can still have a fulfilling life. Some people might choose to kill themselves in their initial despondency. To me, whether or not this is true is irrelevant, this is not the government's decision to make. There should be safeguards in place so people can't walk out the door and take a cyanide pill, but if the patient is properly informed and is forced to consider his/her decision, then it's out of the government's hands.

- Some people ""choose"" to do it, because of the financial burden it puts on their families, a factor outside their control. That money forces them into the decision between breaking their family's bank and killing themselves. Because of the money factor, assisted suicide might be chosen much more by poor people/people of color. I agree with this statement, but it doesn't change the sad truth of the situation. The alternative to not legalizing assisted suicide (which only costs $35-50 on average) is to legally mandate that these people do have to spend more money. Until our (the U.S.'s) health care system's high costs are somehow made affordable to everybody, this is the unfair reality of the situation, no different than the terminal illness that is ""forcing"" the patient to consider assisted suicide in the first place.

- It's legal in every state to refuse necessary treatment to sustain life and it's also legal to be prescribed painkillers for comfort's sake in this context. This rebuttal is a little personal, but my aunt has a severe form of ALS. In the past year and a half I've seen her go from a fully functioning, healthy adult to a wheel-chair bound mute in a neck brace, her disease being incurable at all stages. If she so chose, it would be illegal for her to end it now. To suggest that she could simply refuse all treatment to prolong her life and take painkillers/sedatives for comfort as a serious option to me shows a serious lack of empathy of her situation and many others'.

- Finally, that legalizing assisted suicide will result in the eventual expansion of the ""program"" such that we will soon start assisting people suffering psychological stress, perhaps even mandating a person be euthanized. Usually a finger is pointed at Holland here, so I did a little research. There is only one circumstance where euthanizing any person without his or her consent is legal is in the case of a child below the age of twelve, with the consent of his or her parents and all the expected conditions, terminal illness, extreme pain/discomfort, etc. Whether or not that is fair is irrelevant for this argument, I think; the point is that even the most liberal country in the world on this issue isn't going around deciding which elderly people to kill off, a la Palin's death panels. Even on the slipperiest slope, the mandatory euthanasia of adults is a non-issue.

tl;dr Financial hardship is a reality that people have to deal with and have the right to choose to avoid; waiting periods and proper legal safeguards can prevent people from killing themselves through their doctor before they even attempt to adjust; although it is legal to refuse treatment and receive pain meds, it is hardly a reasonable alternative to direct suicide with some conditions; there is no precedence for the ""slippery slope"" argument that I could find.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1372361404.0,,,True,t3_1h749v,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h749v/i_believe_assisted_suicide_should_be_legalized/,

I am generally speaking about all mainstream pornography, as I think you can't have some kinds without the others.

Some of the negative impacts of porn include:

* The message that a man's pleasure during sex is the only thing that matters, and that female pleasure is irrelevant, which leads to women feeling like their only purpose during a sexual interaction is to bring the man to ejaculate

* The degradation and objectification of women, again showing them that they are there to ensure the man experiences pleasure

* The abuse of individuals who either didn't consent to being in pornography in the first place, or who later regret their decision but can't escape their past

* Pornography addiction, which affects many men and can lead to erectile dysfunction, depression, and more

* The harmful delusions held by men who believe that porn can act as a sort of education process for picking up and sleeping with women, which leads to frustration, depression and possibly aggression/violence when it turns out to be untrue in the real world

As far as I can tell, pornography's major ""pro"" is as a masturbatory aid – but was this really necessary? Were men (primarily) having a difficult time masturbating before porn?

I am open to alternative views and opinions, so by all means – CMV!

1368029506.0,274,self.changemyview,1dxsta,The current movement of feminism actually hinders equality for both genders. CMV.,Bainshie,359,85,474,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dxsta/the_current_movement_of_feminism_actually_hinders/,"So after the recent 'feminism vs tropes' debacle, I recently started researching the more modern feminism movement. Now previously I would have called myself a feminist (And by the dictionary definition, still am), and my initial ideas on the movement include personal heroes like the suffragettes movement, or even FEMEN in the middle east (While I disagree with the way they are doing things, what they are trying to do is highly respected by myself). However issues like donglegate led me look further into the movement.

Now my research started with anti-feminist areas of note, MRA's, etc etc. While the movement itself has issues (Ironically the same issues I later uncovered with Feminism.), I felt this was important in order to successfully build up a counter argument. When researching an area it's generally a good idea to build up opposing points of view, which then you can bring in a discussion. After you bring these up hopefully they will be countered, and you can make an equal opinion. Sadly this never happened, and even the more moderate feminist websites and ideals are straying far from equality or even empowerment of women in general, hurting both men and those they claim to aid.

**1: There is no room for discourse.**

My main issue with this movement was the lack of space for discourse. I am a strong believer in the scientific method. You present your case, people present their opposing views, and the stronger argument gets taken more seriously. This is how theories like the big bang and evolution became the water tight staples of science. A devil's advocate is worth 20 echo chambers if you are interesting in making a solid argument that can stand up on its own.

However, nowhere in the feminist world (/r/feminism, femspire, etc etc) is there a place for such important discussion. In fact this post was originally posted (and deleted from) /r/AskFeminists where supposedly all questions and view points are welcome) Rather than attempting to combat my arguments, much like North Korea and the creationism movement, they instead seemed to be more focused on silencing them. The learning experience I was hoping to gain never appeared. Even when searching online, I couldn't find a single feminist debate that didn't devolve into claims of sexism and other name calling.

**2: Their actions are hurting having actual meaningful talks about rape and other issues.**

Rape is a serious issue, along with DV. However throwing around false statistics like 1 in 3 women will be raped (Actual stats seem to be 1/20-1/10 of both genders) do nothing but to hurt the argument and turn the discussion less on the actual issues (The victims and how we can help them) and more on the incorrect statements.

This attempt to make every female a 'victim of rape' by including things 99% of rational people of both genders wouldn't considered to be 'wrong' also dilutes the meaning of rape in the public opinion, splitting subconsciously in everyone’s mind into 'real rape' (You know, rape rape etc etc), and 'fake rape' (Two people got drunk and had consensual sex, etc etc). Doing this is the equivalent of suggesting that all physical violence of any kind should be defined as 'Murder'. If you were to do that you'd also be diluting the stigma of Murder.

Also the male slut shaming and automatic presumption of guilt in most of their campaigns (""Teach men not to rape, etc etc"") is sexist in of itself, ignoring the many male victims of rape (Also see 4 and 5) and being sexist as hell. Now I already know the counter argument to this 'We aren't saying ALL men, or even ONLY men do it, but we're focusing on that part, honestly.' At which point I call bullshit. If I was to make a ad campaign for:

""Teach black people not to shove crack up their ass while robbing someone and eating fried chicken""

No matter how much I try to say 'Oh I'm not saying all or only black people are doing this, but I want to focus only on that group', this campaign and line of thinking is still racist as hell.

**3: The patriarchy might as well be replaced with 'Magic!'**

What most smart learned people seem to call 'Evolutionary affects on society' the feminist world seems to use this magical patriarchy that never seems to get explained. Sure they explain that it's a system where men have rigged all the systems because of privilege. But then seem to forget to explain where the hell this privilege came from? Did every man around the world all of a sudden at the same time just go 'I'm privileged!' (Without these individual cultures ever talking to one another?). And how the hell did this remain through periods of history where individual societies and cultures were being led by successful powerful strong Women (For instance Queen Mary -&gt; Queen Elizabeth in England). For such an idea to have any merit there'd need to be a 10,000 year old secret society of bigoted men pulling all the strings, but too stupid to remove all the negative effects of said patriarchy.

Of course, conspiracy theories aside, it makes far more sense that evolutionarily speaking, having one sex focus on physical power, and the other to focus on ensuring the survival of offspring, is a good way to ensure the spread of genetic material, a trait found through many many different animal species. And this genetic programming has naturally (And always will) affected our societies view on what exactly makes a good 'man' and 'woman', since several million years of evolution doesn't just go away because you have an Ipod, making both genders although equal human beings, different in their dreams.

**4: Extremely oppressive and offensive to women.**

Which leads me onto my next point. My mother is a brilliant person. She's a strong, intelligent person, and what she did to teach and raise me made me the person I am today, and is something I will always look up to her for (I also look up to my father, but for different reasons). Yet somehow the current movement which claims to represent her suggests that because she chose to do what she loved, that she is somehow a worthless oppressed human. The message of feminism isn't even about breaking gender roles in that sense, as we can see a lack of fund-raisers to get more women into being dustbin men. No the message of feminism is you're only worth something as a women if you're a CEO, that screw what you want to do, you are only represented by the money that you make and anything else is simply you're too weak to stop being oppressed by a man.

And this is further exemplified by a lot of rhetoric provided by the main movements of feminism, removing responsibility and treating the female like a child. You want to make your own choices while drunk? NO! Only a man can handle that kind of responsibility. You want to handle critic and male contact like an adult? NO! Don't you worry your priddy little head, let the men work it all out for you so you never have to feel sad. You think you can handle things not targeted towards your gender, or are self confident enough in who you are for it not to affect you? NO! Only a man can handle that kind of pressure and acting like an adult.

This is even further exemplified when these same movements attempt to suggest that women do no evil. No, all rape cases are true, because women can't do that! No, When Female to male DV happens it's because the man did something wrong. The only reason that woman did that was because of ~~MAGIC~~ ~~Evil MENZ~~ Patriarchy. It's impossible for a woman to be Misandric because! Which all build a picture of females being less than men, when in reality females are also simply adult human beings, who have the same ability to do evil (And good) as men.

**5: Slows down progress and awareness by ignoring 50% of the issue.**

From what I can see the majority of the problems raised by feminism (Rape, DV, gender bias for certain things, society expecting you to do XYZ to be a 'real woman') aren't woman issues at all, but in general humanity issues that overall affect all humans equally. And these are big wide ranging issues that require aid. So to combat these issues, to take a strategy that automatically ignores and alienates 50% of the problem... seems moronically retarded.

Throw into this that the majority of these awareness campaigns are not only highly offensive to men, but also play into the actual perpetrators hands. The people at Steubenville knew exactly what the fuck those mother fuckers were doing. They knew that what they were doing was wrong. It wasn't rape culture, but the fact that they are evil little shits. Why did they claim the opposite? Because they had a smart assed lawyer who knew he could make his clients seem like the victim. And Jesus it actually worked to some extent, giving these monsters sympathy. Oh it's not their fault, their lives got ruined, it's because of the patriarchy. They didn't know it was rape because of the 'patriarchy'! They are the 'real' victims of the patriarchy! Although on an emotionally detached level, I do have to give kudos to the layer for being a smart ass and abusing the current damage these campaigns do.

**6: Wishy washy No stable focus**

And this is the real issue I have the majority of feminism. There's no actual real goals. This isn't a case of 'Make it legal for women to vote' any more, but wishy washy abuse of statistics to flip flop around to make 'feminism' about whatever just offended the author/s of whatever article/campaign. Want to write a story about a evil group of men? That's patriarchy because there's a lack of female's! Want to write a story about a group of evil women. That's also sexist! Want to write about a classic nurturing woman? That's sexist because of gender types! Want to write about a strong woman? That's also sexist because she's just trying to copy men! Want to talk to a random woman? That's sexist and you're probably trying to rape her! Ignore random woman on the street? That's also sexist! Disprove of sexual behaviour? That's slut-shaming and sexist! Want to support and interact with a women in such a way? That's sexist and you're probably trying to rape her!

This flippy floppy lack of focus seems to create problems that don't exist, making interactions between good honestly adults of both sexes harder for everyone for no apparent reason, while at the same time proving zero answers on how to fix these 'issues'.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1368029981.0,,,True,t3_1dxsta,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dxsta/the_current_movement_of_feminism_actually_hinders/,

To start off, I'm a UK citizen, so could all Americans please pretend they are in a country with public healthcare, as this would be annoyingly complicated if we had to factor private insurance into the argument.

I think that a huge amount of medical problems these days (heart disease, diabetes etc. in the under 65s, these plus mobility problems in 65 and overs) are caused by a lack of sustained physical health. If I pay taxes, and you get a rare cancer, I'm happy to see my taxes go to treating you. However, if you get type 2 diabetes or something similar from the fact that you never exercise and eat a pile of crap, I think you should have to pay for it yourself (I am aware other factors are involved). 

I think this is doubly important for over 65s. In countries where elderly citizens have to keep moving/ working all their life, they lose their mobility at a far lower rate than our seniors. This is even more so the case for those who practice tai chi quan or other similar exercises. 

If people look after their bodies and things go wrong, then the NHS or its equivalent in other countries is a great thing to have. 

I see no reason why we should bother giving free treatment out to those who don't even look after themselves. 

Edit: Quite a lot of people are having a go at an argument I didn't make. I didn't say people over a certain weight got no treatment, nor did i say people with diabetes got no treatment.

Why then is it acceptable for domestic violence shelters to turn away men and boys? Isn't the idea that women need to have a 'safe space' away from men inherently prejudicial? Doesn't that seem to imply that that it's legitimate for women to fear abuse from men just because they're male? Or that male victims can't be trusted around women?

If you're going to make the argument that this fear among female victims is so instinctively rooted that it must be worked around, then if men must be excluded for the sake of women's mental health, should there not be an equal number of men's shelters to take care of them?

EDIT: Several people here have been trying to explain battered women's fear of men as if I'm simply not understanding it. No. I understand it completely; *I'm questioning whether accommodating it causes more harm than good.* And, given the level of assumptions based on nothing but popular belief, I'm starting to question how prevalent this fear actually is. Full disclosure: I was abused by my mother for my entire childhood and beyond. She has given me permanent mental scars. *I have NEVER blamed her behavior on her gender, nor have I treated other women badly because of her actions.* And I've put effort into scouring anything like that out of my mind, simply because it's unfair and untrue. If I can hold myself to that standard, why does society not expect the same from women? *And are we even sure that this is an issue?* Has anyone done a survey of battered women, asking them whether or not they can deal with the presence of men in shelters? Has anyone researched whether female victims who have to cohabitate with male victims are harmed in any way by it? I have more questions than answers on this subject, but of what I've seen so far, it seems like we're helping neither men or women with this cultural attitude. We're treating men as if giving them access to mental health is *optional*, and we're treating women as if they're so fragile that we must cater to fears they might not even have.

EDIT: Y'all can pretty much go home now. [Langlie](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eyw96/i_think_that_keeping_men_out_of_domestic_violence/ca5atqh) basically won. She gave a simple, practical reason for women's shelters to exclude men, and it had nothing to do with the cultural myth that all battered women can't tell one man from another. I accept that this may *sometimes* happen due to extreme trauma, but no amount of argument could convince me that it made sense to presume this as the *default state* of all abused women, and to deny men help based on this presumption. This is an inherently heartless argument which puts women's comforts above men's needs in importance. It has no more solid factual footing than any other stereotype.

So, I accept Langlie's explanation as an imperfect but necessary solution to the problem of abusers trying to harm shelter occupants. I no longer think that keeping men out of women's shelters is bigotry. I now believe that *most people's justifications for this idea are based in bigotry.*

CMV,nwob,305,77,503,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hvreo/victim_blaming_and_offering_practical_advice_on/,"Frequently on internet discussion, the term 'victim blaming' is thrown around a lot and has caused a great deal of confusion to myself and others.

If I say 'she's promiscuous, she was asking to be raped', that's quite clearly blaming a victim of a crime for that crime.  However, if I said 'it's not sensible to go to that particular bit of town at that time of night by yourself', am I blaming the victim or am I merely trying to offer advice? Both of the above would arguably reduce the person's likelihood of being raped again in the future.

I hear it said that by offering advice *of any kind*, whether it be 'stop being a whore' or something more constructive, I am implicitly blaming the victim for the crime that has occurred.  Is this the case? 

If I left my keys in my car and the engine running in the middle of a city, with the door wide open, and then took a half-hour walk to find that the car had gone, could I accuse someone of victim blaming if they suggested I not leave my car in such a vulnerable position?  *I didn't steal the car.* The car thief did.  Yet we feel different about these two situations.  Why are we not able to abdicate responsibility for the safety of our private property the way we are apparently able to do so for our bodies?

Also, I feel I have to add the obligatory:

Clearly, in a perfect world, nobody would be raped or murdered or robbed, but until then, can we try to reach some consensus here?  It is an empirical fact that certain behaviours will increase your risk of certain crimes.  Suggesting the avoiding of these behaviours, while **neither representing the ideal or the most important**  focus of activity (i.e the perpetrators of crime should be made less able or likely to do so rather than focusing purely on the victim) can have a positive effect.

So there you have it.  If I offer you advice about avoiding a crime, I am not necessarily (implicitly or explicitly) blaming you for being the victim of it.

Let me just define my meaning of 'scientific understanding'. The typical view of someone who uses scientific theory and experiment as a factual representation of the universe and reality. The person with dogmatic beliefe then, has a concrete belief in an objective reliance of scientific theorem. Let me also warn you that this is a very pedantic post. 

Looking at the following thought process:


    I subjectively observe a table. 
    I have a distorted 'picture' of that table in my mind
    Meaning, the picture I have of the table then..
    has less information than the 'real' table
    So I then say that reality exists and I observe it with subjectivity 
    However, if I am always confided to the distorted/subjective reality 
    I can then say that to me, 'outside reality' doesn't exist
    As I have no tangible link to it
    And the only reality I can verify exists, 
    ...is the local reality of my own experience


I believe you cannot objectify reality without assumptions. And the closest we can get to objectify reality is it's structure not the content. Therefore, all information and knowledge are objective derivatives of subjective (and distorted) data/input. 


These peoples 'Scientific understanding' then, relies on the *faith* of a subtle yet hugely significant unfalseifiable set of assumptions. Such as claiming an objective reality is real outside our own mind. This faith is dogmatic as proof (in my opinion) doesn't exist. Therefore...


*I believe a lot of people with 'scientific understanding' rely on a dogma just as much, if not more-so than religious people. CMV*


Just for clarification, it's my belief that people *can* have scientific understanding without dogma. These people I would describe as people who are aware of the assumptions they and others may adhere to. And that they have an abstract metaphysical understanding of where their understanding sits with the current scientific theorem. (*e.g. someone who accepts a new observation on the sun, yet realises the sun may be a projected input into their mind feeding into their experience not unlike the movie 'The Matrix' - so the sun might not be 'real'*).

___
TLDR &amp; ELi5: ~~Those who followed 'scientific understanding' over 'religious understanding' during the times when we believed the earth was ~~flat what the sun revolved around - held on to a belief the earth was flat just like some people also held on to the belief of religion.~~ A proper scientific understanding, is open to conflicting 'truths' and is aware of the assumptions of the current meta-scientific-theorem. 



Edit: Note, it is not the 'science' that provides the dogma, it is the way some people interpret it/use it in their thinking/cognitive dissonance.

***Update:***


Firstly I was overwhelmed at the comments; in how I could have portrayed my view better as some people misinterpreted me, in how many great comments came about and in how there was a genuinely good discussion. 


Secondly, I must admit, I did use religion inappropriately here. I knew this type of title would get a lot of attention. Luckily it paid off, and people were able to get my meaning. My main point was that I find that science relies on a set of assumptions which a lot of people aren't aware of - or fully understanding of. [My thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/neurophilosophy/comments/1erbfj/cognitive_relativity/) goes into more detail on the view. But my view comes with a frustration of being poorly presented and the struggle can be seen today and in the linked thread. But there's a great deal of comments here that I can sieve through and either a) change my view b) better portray my view. So for that many thanks, I regret I have tested peoples patience enough, but I cannot commit to any comments changing my view yet. Please understand it will take some time to read through, today or another day - I will try to award a delta where appropriate. 


Opposing points:

&gt; My use of the word 'dogmatic/dogma' wasn't completely appropriate. 


* I wanted to illustrate that some people 'believe' in science with faith. Specifically, that reality is exclusively objective or rational. This is complimented usually by their inability to properly identify their subjective bias and the assumptions they and science make.


&gt; My use of the phrase 'scientific understanding' was slightly confusing.


* There are people who have a scientific understanding which I would (as per my view) categorize as proper scientific understanding like [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hxgyq/i_believe_a_lot_of_people_with_scientific/cayzhj5) by user /u/rmill3r. As well as the type mentioned in the above bullet point. 





&gt; Scientific 'belief' is 'better' than the religious 'belief' 


* This was not an intended talking point - I just used it as a comparison that would catch the eye of science-minded people. Therefore I will not address which is 'better' because a) I can't fully represent a religious person as I am not b) the terms for 'better' are subjective and differ. However I do have somewhat of an opinion on this and I think for evolution and survival, it is necessary to favor a scientific belief over a religious for the physical sake of survival only.

I'm not an MRA and I actually think a large amount of people involved in the MRA subreddit have some pretty problematic views and attitudes.  That said running an article titled ""Fuck You MRA"" isn't advancing your cause. 

Hugo Schyzer has already recently admitted most of his columns were ""clickbait"", but Jezebel editors ran them.

CMV.,justliveforfun,308,98,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1j44fb/i_dont_think_downloading_songs_for_free_which_i/,"If I wouldn't pay for it anyway, but would have it if it was free and it doesn't hurt anyone then why not have it? It could actually benefit artists by bringing awareness to others that hear it when I play it. I could see how giving the songs to someone who would have bought them otherwise would be wrong since that would have taken away potential profits from the artist, but that is a tangent from this post. If I couldn't download the songs for free I wouldn't buy them and would either listen to music on a free service (such as pandora or the radio) or download other work that isn't priced. I will say that is selfish though since you're not really giving back (at least in an expected financial sense) for something provided for you. 

*Edit* - I guess my view is more about large scale sharing being something that shouldn't be looked at as something that hurts artists - its more of an evolution in our society and needs to be embraced by the music industry instead of trying to make it illegal since they can't make as much money through sales anymore. I don't think sharing should be illegal - and ""pirating"" is just sharing at a larger scale. 

*edit2* - My view is changed and I see the harm that pirating could cause. I think I realized I would listen to the radio or other free to listen things a lot more if I didn't do it - but I also wouldn't have music be involved in my life as much as it is now and enjoy it even close to the same extent (which I hope artists still have as a goal). Downloading songs for free is selfish - whether it has done more good than harm is another question and too complex and subjective to answer.

The country isn't perfect, but it is certainly better than where I was born. I tell you truthfully, if my friends and family from back home could magically come here, they wouldn't hesitate to take a low paying job. They would be happy to work a fast food job for 3 dollars an hour and get welfare and food stamps.

In short they would be part of the cheap labor pool that rich people, like the CEO facebook, want to bring the USA to allow them to suppress wages. The rich people will not be hurt by a flood of cheap labor into this country, but the middle and lower classes will.

Believe me, my family and friends back in my country would love to take advantage of California's benefits for illegal citizens if they where here. SO for me the emotional argument that somehow it's ""fair"" to allow illegal immigrants to become US citizens and take US jobs is bullshit. 

SO what if you were illegally brought in the usa when you were 5 years old? How about you say thank you for the free education and benefits you got and go back home and make your country a better place. Oh you want to go to college and get a high paying US job? SO you think the US should reward you by giving you a high paying job that could have gone to a legal citizen?

I really do believe that ""immigrations reform"" (amnesty by any other name) will probably lead to a sharp decline in the quality of life for US citizens and the people pushing it don't care because they are already rich or they want to secure a power base (politicians) 

***update 15 hours in***

Thanks for all the conversation everyone. Unfortunately very few arguments persuaded me to change my mind. The most effective would have been evidence that creating 11-25 million new citizens would not disrupt the economy or lower standard of living. No one could provide this.

However it seems like most of the comments seem to believe i have a ""got mine, screw you"" mentality, which i can say is untrue. Other comments simply point out that America has prospered in the past from immigrants and therefore always will.

The most disturbing comments to me are the ones where people don't think of America as a country at all, but just a place to work, so who cares who is here. I will never be able to understand people who think no borders and no difference between citizens and non citizens will make a country stronger. 

I got significant down votes for being truthful, but that's ok. I knew posting this i was stepping on rocky race related issues, which i don't think i could have even brought up if I were white i or else i would be label a racist.

CMV.",Wisecow,289,89,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ieve1/i_assume_panhandlers_are_just_lazy_people_or/,"Let me preface by saying I feel I am genuinely considerate of other people in general. I don’t consider myself naïve, but I *try* to give everyone the benefit of the doubt or a hand up when I can, regardless if it seems like they deserve it. I have and will go the extra mile to help a stranger who appears to be stuck on the side of the road, a friend who needs a favor, to hold a door open for someone, to carefully stack my dishes on the table for a busy waitress, etc.

This particular subset of individuals I have a hard time trusting, though. It might be the area I live in, Minneapolis, that gives me this viewpoint. The “homeless” population isn’t incredibly large, relatively speaking, with just above 2,600 people in the county who are considered homeless (I’m not sure how they are classified). Also, most of our panhandlers seem pretty well kept or at least they appear to be. But, even when I was in Sacramento recently on business I saw a couple cardboard signs begging for money, in which their owners lounged on lawn chairs while they were playing on their laptops.

Don’t these people have any sort of family or friends to take them in? Maybe they don’t need anyone to take them in because they aren’t really homeless? And if they are homeless, why will nobody who knows them help them? Is there reasons the people who know them aren’t willing to help them? Is it because they frivolously spend their money on drug or alcohol addictions? Is it because they are just lazy and not deserving of the help? I feel if these people spend half of the time they spend sitting there and begging for other people’s money on something productive like searching for a job, taking advantage of free community education, or at least offering some sort of service they would be in a much better place. I struggling giving any sort of “donation” to someone I don’t think is trying to do anything to help themselves; worse yet will just take the money to be funneled into illicit activities.

*Please note: I’m not questioning if there are good, well intentioned people who are homeless that are in need of help. I’m sure there are. My viewpoint is concerning panhandlers or people just begging for money and why I have never offered them money.*

[Edit: Clarification]

[Edit 2: Hey! I just want to thank you all for the awesome feedback thus far. There are some really interesting and potentially valid points. That being said, I'm at work and don't have the to read and put together thoughtful responses to everything. I will continue to read them through the day and try to acknowledge as much as I can when I get home. I think the mental illness counterpoint is something I need to consider. I'm not ready to CMV just yet, as I don't know what types of programs are offered for individuals with this issue, but I want to explore this further. Thanks for being such a super community. I want to have faith in my fellow man and would love to find reason to do so for everybody.]

[Edit 3: When I wrote this I didn’t realize I had two very independent viewpoints on this subject, which I had unintentionally merged as one single opinion.

1)	I assume panhandlers are just lazy people or addicts.

2)	They would just spend the money I give them on drugs/alcohol.

I acknowledge, thanks to some [interesting points]( http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ieve1/i_assume_panhandlers_are_just_lazy_people_or/cb3stju) made by /u/lonelyfriend which I hadn’t considered, that it is unfair of me to determine all panhandlers are lazy or addicts, undeserving of my consideration. Furthermore, I need to take into consideration the underlying circumstances, beyond an individual’s control, that might have led them to addiction and consorted effort it takes to get out that vicious cycle.

I still stand firm on the latter portion of my original post. I remain unconvinced giving money to a panhandler is the right way to resolve the issue. I feel this action has too much potential to perpetuate as well as prolong the individual’s circumstances. Although there are people who might use this money for good, there is enough risk involved in this action for me to be uncertain of the outcome. Admittedly, considering my new stance on the initial concern that led me to the latter part of my conclusion, I do feel it would be worthy of me to offer alternatives to money such as food or even volunteer hours to help those struggling in these conditions.]

It's a mix of tables with chairs for people who want to eat, bar tables, and standing room. People line up really early (an hour+ before doors open), because there are no ins and outs, and if you go in at doors open, and don't get a seat, you will be standing for a while. 

I arrived right at doors open, and thus wasn't expecting a seat, and didn't find one. However, the obese couple directly behind us in line asked management upon coming in that they set up some extra seats, because they couldn't stand for the show. Management obliged, and the couple ended up partially blocking an aisle-way, with seats right next to people how had been in line for over an hour. 

On the one hand, there's really nothing that separates their ability to stand for a show from a disabled person's. They were big enough that there's no way they could do it. So in that respect I understand why management accommodated them.  I suppose the reason I feel the way I do, is because the vast majority of obese people got that way by choice, but that doesn't really hold up. I definitely wouldn't feel the same way about a chainsaw juggler who had only one leg. I'd be OK with him getting a seat. I suppose you could extend it even further to a disabled soldier. They chose to go to war, yet I don't begrudge them their accommodations.

In this particular situation, I'd tend to say it's the responsibility of the person that needs to sit to show up early, regardless if they were born disabled, disabled in an accident, or if they disabled themselves. However, this goes beyond shows. I remember [there was a thread a few weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1b3tio/airline_fat_tax_should_heavy_passengers_pay_more/) about whether obese people should be forced to pay for an extra seat in an airplane instead of making that decision themselves, and I recently heard [an NPR story](http://www.npr.org/2013/02/20/172470371/being-obese-can-weigh-on-employees-insurance) about wellness programs at work, and whether it's fair for employers to provide benefits and levy penalties based on how healthy employees are. 

I don't have a problem with either the ""fat tax"" for airline tickets, or mandatory wellness programs, but I don't think I'd feel the same if airlines charged a fee for passengers in wheelchairs, or if employers raised premium contributions for every quarter that went by without one of their employees beating their crones diagnosis.

Recently there has been certain events that made me thought that we are seriously heading in the wrong direction. And it's all about the citizens. Since about 9 years, italians can't choose their own representants as parties changed the law so that lists are ""fixed"". Italy is one of the the last countries in western Europe for education quality, corruption level, freedom of word, economic freedom. Debt is huge and has been created by giving out free money to companies and creating temporary jobs. Most italians still don't have access to fast broadband; the biggest telco in Italy owns 99% of it and asks the State to cover expenses for broadband infrastructures over 1mbps, while offers the worst prices for it of all Europe and stops competition from entering the market.

Right-wing spend most of its time defending Silvio Berlusconi from trials and self perceived plots by justice, while he owns most italian medias and indirectly controlled public television for years. Berlusconi is so important that when our Supreme Court announced he would be judged on July 30th, they asked to close the Parliament for some days. He also recently used its power to stop the reassignation of a TV frequency, and Italy spent under a billion euros in fines because of that. In the early 00s he escaped jail by depenalizing his own crime.

Left-wing is perceived as inept, self focused and simply caring only about getting Berlusconi out of parliament. Left-wing managed to win (by 0.5%) elections, yet can't rule the country without Berlusconi because they don't have the majority of the Parliament and the other party won't ally with them - yet it is blaming left-wing and right-wing (""it's a coup d'était by banks and hidden lobbies!"") and asking to rule alone with full powers; this party wants Italy to give out money to every citizen without a job and cut down almost completely wages of public servants. 

Taxation is over 50% while tax evasion is so high that probably 1/3 of italians don't pay taxes. Most people under 25 years don't work. Only 1 italian in 4 has a degree; most of them are completely useless or regarded as obstacles to getting underqualified jobs. Young people rarely have a stable job and live alone, as they need help from parents (often economic help). 

The biggest industry in the country (FIAT) is not competitive and blames a trade union for its inettitude on the markets. It is also moving production to countries like Poland after decennial sussidies from government.

Recently the right-wing banned organ transplantations from animals, so we can eat them but not save people with them. It's rare that a doctor practice abortion in our country. There is still no protection for LGBT couples. Catholic religion is a subject in schools.

1372594267.0,181,self.changemyview,1hd0us,I don't think anyone should get extra time in an exam. CMV.,NigsBeLyk_Illuminati,264,83,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hd0us/i_dont_think_anyone_should_get_extra_time_in_an/,"This may not exist in some exams, but in the high school exams that I took (the IB), some students were allowed extra time for things such as: dyslexia, ADD, etc. Now before you think I'm a complete ass for essentially harming people with those conditions' future by not allowing them to perform to the ""best"" of their abilities (quotations will be explained later), here are my reasons for thinking as such:

In my view, an exam should assess a person's ability to absorb and process information in a manner suitable for the exam (for example: in math or physics exam, to be able to solve problems quickly and correctly). I think the exam should be used to distinguish between candidates for university, or a career. As such, I think that the time allocated is a rather large factor: if you have more time to absorb or process the information, you may eventually get it. But the point is to distinguish between person A and person B for a position. 

Given an infinite amount of time, I would say more people would be able to get 100% on an exam, which then defeats the purpose of taking one unless your aim was just to have a confidence booster.

Now, I also think that when applying (let's take the example of applying to university), these conditions should be considered: the admissions officer should know that your exam result may not be completely reflective of what you could do given a lot more time. But in the context of an exam, I don't think its about measuring your best abilities when given infinite time. The rate at which a student can absorb and process the information should be compared. This is why I put quotations around """"best"" of their abilities"". Of course they could do better with more time, but so can everyone (a generalization, I know: I recognize that I cannot say that all can answer every question correctly in an exam). 

Now the reason I care is that the exams are graded on a curve. If you compensate for a student's difficulty in reading by providing them extra time to raise their grade, it will (if enough are given more time) affect everyone's grade. It also doesn't tell the admissions officer what you can do in the time given normally in an exam, compared to another student. It defeats the purpose (in my opinion) of a standardized exam. 

As well as this, I am a little skeptical as to the ability of the examiner to determine exactly how much more time would make the exam ""fair"".


Yes, it sucks that a person has this condition. Yes, I think it should be compensated for, or at least considered. No, I do not think that giving extra time in a standardized exam graded on a curve is the way to do so. I think it's like having a race between Pistorius and Bolt on the 100m, and giving Pistorius extra time. Then, taking that result into account as an average to determine who is the fastest runner. Again, I'm sorry for Pistorius to have a natural disadvantage (although I do not claim to be an expert in whether this provides disadvantages but I just compared best running times), but I don't think he should be given extra time due to his condition. 

TL;DR: I think extra time in an exam is like giving a legless man a head start in a race with Usain bolt until he almost beats him, then considering this a good comparison. 


PS: Let me know if my explanation isn't that good, or is missing some logical connectors. I'll try and clear it up to show exactly what I think.


Edit 1: Wow this has become bigger than I expected! Thanks so much for all the contributions: it's fascinating to read these comments. A common theme I'm seeing among the answers is now the disagreement on what exams test (which I should have clarified earlier): Some, like Sabazius, Dr_Wreck, and sarcasmandsocialism, seem to say that exams usually should not include how fast you can answer, or rather, as Sabazius said ""the quality being tested was a student's ability to perform in a given amount of time"". I actually do think so. In this case, as many explained better than me: the condition does affect a part of the aptitude being tested. So giving extra time does not level the playing field, but rather distorts results (which was what I tried to explain earlier). In this case, how does my opinion hold up?

Edit 1.5 (super quick added edit): Another thing I've noticed is people pointing out that I seem to be not thinking outside of the school world, and not taking into account the fact that exams aren't perfect for demonstrating how good someone would be in the real world. This is partly true (I do sometimes get a little stuck in the school world) but I also think that exams both do a fairly good job at emulating the real world in a period of time, and at the moment seems to be the only viable way to compare aptitude(and realistic: ideally one would interview each person for a long time to figure out how apt they are but that's a bit time consuming/expensive).

I think this is a subreddit that can FINALLY help me understand the concept of cutting/self-harming. Every other subreddit, when I voice my opinions on this very matter, I get downvoted to oblivion. However, I want to change, not because of ultimately meaningless Internet points, but it's because this represents a major prejudice I have. But unlike most people who recognize they have a prejudice, I'm trying to do something about it.

Here's my current viewpoint: We ALL have shitty things happen to us, and most of realize that life isn't all unicorns and rainbows. But I wonder, isn't there something, *anything* you guys can do besides cutting and/or harming yourselves? Something that won't lead to your death if you cut too deep.

I'm not trying to down cutters/self-harmers. I'm trying to see what would make you do it in the first place. This is a shitty example, but none of my friends, family, etc. cut themselves when life doesn't work out for them. And frankly, if my daughter feels that cutting/self-harming is an appropriate way to handle life's problems, I'd get her help, but I would feel I failed as a father for not teaching her coping mechanisms.

I don't believe that our country, culture or legal system is fairly built to support both men and women being allowed to be shirtless (and braless) in public.

I campaign and support womens rights in prettymuch all endeavors, but I can't help but feel a slight tinge of hypocrisy whenever I see a ""shirtless"" rally to support laws which will allow women to walk around completely topless in public.  Why?

Because in our culture we've built such strong views about the female physique, even legal views.  I do *not* believe that we, as a culture, should stifle change (this is, after all, natural evolution of society)...the problem with it, to me, is that we have such strong liability legislation and social statutes which create a disparity between how we're **told** we should now be treating breasts vs. how we **do** treat breasts.  For example;

As a male, any number of people could stare at my chest (shirtless or not), touch my chest, etc...without repercussion.  A bouncer at a bar could hold me at a distance by placing his hand there, for instance.  A person at my workplace could move me to the side at the chest level, also.  

None of those actions would be deemed appropriate if I were a woman.  Yet the most common argument I hear for equal sex shirtless legislation is **men can do it, women should be able to, as well. They're just breasts, get over it**, said by people who try to dismiss breasts flippantly as if it's ""just another body part"".  Which it is, however, clearly people *dont* feel that it's just another everyday body part...because I could get in severe trouble for touching them, or even looking too long.

It just seems to be like an awful double-standard...and until the same people who say ""they're just breasts"" *actually* believe that statement, then there's no point in trying to pretend that a spade is just a spade.

CMV?

**EDIT:  I've actually had a LOT of very good discussion (along with some smarmy conclusion jumping and strange misguided interpretation).  I think my mind is almost changed, but I suppose I should have asked this along with my original post -- What would be the argument FOR equal shirtless laws, other than simply saying ""men and women are equal, dur""?  Ive received a lot of discussion arguing against my points, but nothing really arguing for the opposite, so I'm curious.**

**EDIT 2:  Great job today.  Along with the ethical debate of allowing same-sex topless laws, I received some great perspective in terms of how society tends to behave in areas that already have these laws.  

From what I understand, it's more of a pseudo-hot button topic? The reality of the situation is that, in the places that we have laws that allow same sex toplessness, the general public doesn't seem to care? Kinda like how there's nothing (that I know of) to show that a ton of people started lighting up when weed was decriminalized?

You, and several others, have done a great job today :)

CMV",blacktrance,212,36,200,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dpbrf/i_support_free_migration_and_believe_that_all/,"Counterarguments to common arguments against open borders:

* ""Immigrants would take jobs that should go to natives."" Regardless of whether immigrants are taking jobs that would otherwise have gone to natives (the empirics I've seen lead me to believe that they don't), why should being a native entitle anyone to a better chance at a job? Suppose someone made a similar argument against women in the workforce - ""Women shouldn't be allowed to work because they'll take jobs from men"" - or against efficiency - ""People shouldn't be efficient and productive because then it takes fewer people to do the same job"". If an employer wants to hire a native worker, and the worker is capable of consenting to taking the job (i.e. is not a child or extremely mentally unhealthy), then they can agree to a mutually beneficial contract. This is uncontroversial (except among the far left), so what's different if the worker happens to live in another country?

* ""Immigrants would change our culture."" Immigrants have changed American culture in the past, and no one today thinks that's a bad thing. More importantly, culture is no more than what individuals who live in a certain area or identify with a certain group tend to do. If some native-born Americans suddenly adopted different cultural norms, no one would support deporting them.

* ""Immigrants would abuse the welfare state."" There are two answers to this. The first is that it would not be difficult to restrict the welfare state to citizens. The second addresses the purpose of the welfare state. If the purpose of redistribution is to benefit the unlucky (those who happen to be born into low-income families or lose their jobs through no fault of their own), then people who are born in third-world countries are even more unlucky than either of those groups. If they come to first-world countries and work, they would be more productive than they would have been in their native countries (not to mention they could be fleeing things like wars and genocide), and, in a utilitarian calculus, the benefits to these immigrants far outweigh the benefits of the welfare state to those who are already wealthy by global standards.

* ""Immigrants would increase crime."" I've not seen much empirical evidence to justify this claim. Yes, there are some places with many immigrants (or children of immigrants) that have high crime rates, but the same can be said of natives - plenty of high-crime areas don't have any foreigners. And even if immigrants are disproportionally likely to commit crimes, that is not an argument against immigration unless you also believe that native-born groups who are disproportionately likely to commit crimes should be deported as well.

* ""We live here, so we decide the rules."" Even if that's true, what's good about current rules? The above arguments show why current rules are bad (or at least internally inconsistent), so why not change them? More fundamentally, though, why do you get to decide the rules? If I own a house and want to rent it out to an immigrant, under what authority can the government say that I can't? Does it own my house? If so, how did it come to own it? If I am a business owner and want to hire an immigrant, and the immigrant wants to work for me, what authority does the government have to stop a mutually beneficial voluntary exchange? Does it own my business? The country is not owned by the government, it is a composite of a large number of properties with different owners, administered by a government. Government is a service, not an owner - if you always hire the same plumber to work on your pipes, that doesn't mean he owns them, so why is it different for government?

Edit for another common counterargument:

The only other individuals that come close to the statistical average are a straight white female, and gay white male, and a straight black male. However we have individuals of all nationalities, sexual orientations, and philosophies.

Now, this does not make me uncomfortable at all, and I love the people I work with.

However, there are a lot of events and meetings about diversity initiatives and oppression and that sort of stuff. That is all well and good, but there is a lot of talk about privilege. There is a common opinion that ""white/straight people don't deserve recognition because white people own the world."" I'm not saying white people should be included in diversity recognition.

However, I feel like I'm being told that I need to feel guilty for something people did a long time ago just because they have the same skin color as me.

I can't help that I am white or straight. Am I ""lucky"" that I don't have to experience the oppression that minorities may face? Yes. But why should I have to feel like that means I have done something wrong, or I am at fault for anything? 

My instinct is to refuse to burden guilt for something someone else did. Will I support the rights of all humans regardless of creed/nationality/orientation? Absolutely. Will I feel bad for being white? No.

Everything I said above is what comes to my mind instinctively. It is **extremely** likely that I am not seeing all facets of the issue, and I am completely wrong.

CMV.,averysillyredditor,237,66,225,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k75uw/its_not_necessarily_misogynistic_to_portray/,"Hello! This subreddit seems absolutely swamped with feminism-related posts, but I didn't see any that exactly fit the bill for me, so here I go.

I strongly believe that women, much, much more than men, are portrayed as sex symbols across just about every medium of communication. I take it as a fact of life that ""(hetero-normative) sex sells"" and that sexy women have been a part of product marketing more or less since advertising came about as an industry. These images exist on a slippery slope; an advertisement featuring a sexualized woman, for example, can very easily build a pernicious narrative that objectifies women as a group and disseminate quite nasty messages about female sexuality, female agency, female desires, etc etc. However! I don't think that the original sexy image necessarily connotes negative things about women!

Human beings can process and recognize symbols in any given piece of media in millions, if not an infinite, amount of ways. The culture and background of the audience engenders certain presets, to be sure, but I don't think that it (i.e. one's cultural indoctrination) at all ""instructs"" the viewer to read the media a certain way. People have agency! 

So that was a bit abstract, I'll come down to the dirty stuff! When I see a sexy woman in an ad, a video game (I'll be frank, the controversy over Dragon's Crown was what prompted this CMV), a movie, whatever, I do not think my cultural background limits me, or anyone, to objectifying that woman. If this ad/TV show/yada yada does not provide me with the appropriate narrative about this symbol (i.e. regardless of its creator's intent, if I myself do not build this narrative), I am not necessarily going to objectify this woman!

I'm really sorry; I am terrible at framing my thoughts! But please, tell me if you understood me, and CMV!

CMV,controversialideas,244,73,299,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gz53f/believing_there_is_no_difference_in_intelligence/,"Let's start by looking at the easy case. Only the most liberal of liberals believes there to be no physical differences between races. Blacks generally have dark skin. Asians generally have slanty eyes. That's basically what we define races in terms of.

Only slightly more controversially, let's move on to the fact that black people are on average taller and stronger and Asians are on average shorter and weaker. Most people agree that to deny those observations is PC thuggery gone wild, and to most they are obvious on their face.

Yet, as soon as we start to talk about the mind - intelligence, language, artistic ability, moral sense - suddenly it becomes completely unacceptable to even consider the idea that there may be a difference between races. For most educated people, it is uncomfortable even to think about it, since the idea is immoral. For a scientist to make observations on this fact is for his career to be ended. All differences must be attributed to societal factors like discrimination and situational differences.

I'm going to now focus on the specific example of the black race. I realize that this is a very sensitive subject, and it is a very negative focus, but it is the easiest example with which to make the point.

People hold the aforementioned view despite the fact that in basically every situation across the world, darker skinned people are less successful and more prone to violence. Blacks are not a homogenous culture, but black majority countries are as a rule unsuccessful, uneducated, crime-ridden, wartorn, and corrupt. Black minorities on average in virtually every country do worse in education. Black minorities on average in almost every country have higher crime rates.

Imagine a hypothetical world where it is a fact that black people are somewhat less intelligent and less altruistic, but people don't want to believe it's true out of faith in the equality of races. Would this hypothetical world actually look any different at all than our current world?

How can any rational person recognize there are physical differences encoded into the DNA of different races but then refuse to recognize that this same DNA could be the source of apparent mental differences?

-----------------

Additional notes:

I am well aware of the fact that outliers exist, and that the mental differences within races are greater than the mental differences between races, but this is not relevant to a discussion of racial averages.

Edit: I really regret bringing the black race into this, especially in a negative light. It is an overly-charged subject which derails the conversations.

Firstly, I must define what I understand to be patriotism, which may not be in line exactly with other definitions, else arguing about it is entirely pointless.

I consider patriotism to be pride in your homeland and where you come from, alongside the belief that your homeland is superior in some manner to anywhere else. I consider it to be loyalty to land and property.

Now, onto my reasoning for why I believe that loyalty to where you come from to be a negative thing.
&gt;You have no choice in where you are born, it is entirely random chance which put you in the country that you were born in.


&gt;It creates rivalries and negative emotion between groups with patriotic feelings for different areas, often leading to conflict.


&gt;The idea that this bit of land and originating from this bit of land makes you superior or inferior is a ridiculous concept.


&gt;Patriotic feeling is often abused to control and persuade large groups of people (progaganda posters during wartime for example) in bad situations, e.g. fighting a war they don't understand for under the guise of protecting their country.

Star Trek episodes have a philosophical/humanistic element that either makes you think about society in a different way or about the laws of nature in a different way. It literally makes you smarter.

Star Trek alien species, while not always having better makeup, have much more distinct and interesting cultures. Orions, Vulcans, Klingons, and Betazoids all have their own distinct customs and habits that are very interesting and, again, make you rethink your own culture's tendencies.

Star Trek series have relatable but admirable characters that you grow to love. (Except maybe Enterprise, of course.) I think Voyager illustrates the point most clearly: we grow a strong bond with these people as they struggle to get back home.

Star Trek DS9 encapsules and expresses almost every single ideological problem America is facing after 9/11. And the series ended years before 9/11 happened.

The Inner Light made me cry like a little girl and I choke up when I think about that last scene. I'm even getting a little teary-eyed now.

On that topic, the acting in Star Trek is just loads better than Star Wars.

Lighthearted Star Trek characters are more likeable and less racist than lighthearted Star Wars characters.

Star Wars is really just a soap opera in space. It could've taken place in rural China with cosmetic changes.

Star Trek has inspired more technological innovations than any other element of popular fiction in human history.

My main argument stems from a reading of the Constitution. The Constitution represents a contract between the Government and The People. I find the following excerpts to be particularly important in this case (listed in order of applicability, with emphasis added):

~~Amendment XIV, Section 1, Paragraph 1:

&gt;**All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States** and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; **nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.**~~

Amendment V:

&gt;**No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury**, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, **nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law**; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

Amendment VI:

&gt;In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the **right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury** of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and **to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence [sic].**

Article III, Section 2, Paragraph 3:

&gt;The **Trial of all Crimes**, except in Cases of Impeachment, **shall be by Jury**; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.

Article II, Section IV:

&gt;**The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of**, Treason, Bribery, or other **high Crimes and Misdemeanors.**

(Online source for quotations: http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html)


In my understanding of the Constitution, ~~all four~~ three of the fatalities were unlawful. ~~The killing of Anwar Al-Awlacki should be classified Murder in the First Degree, as it was clearly premeditated and he was not tried, so the killing cannot be deemed capital punishment.~~ The killing of Al-Awlacki can be justified by saying he was an enemy combatant, the capture of whom would have been infeasible. However, if the three were accidental as claimed, they are still felony manslaughter. Such felony level offenses are gross abuses of power, and must fit the definition of a ""high crime"". This, in my understanding, makes it obvious that impeachment is an appropriate course of action, and, if the Senate finds the defendants guilty, they should then be tried in civilian court, since the offenses are against other citizens of the United States.

Change my view.

**EDIT** /u/Jazz-Cigarettes changed my view on Al-Awlacki, but I remain unconvinced that the other three deaths are not impeachable offenses.

**EDIT 2** As /u/Tyrelxpeioust pointed out, the XIV Amendment applies only to the States (and so is irrelevant here), while the V Amendment is relevant.

1372005407.0,165,self.changemyview,1gwxjk,I believe the recent fad against bullying is not only an ill-conceived strawman but that it is also detrimental to the people it is trying to help. I invite you to CMV.,ComputerGeek01,228,63,271,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gwxjk/i_believe_the_recent_fad_against_bullying_is_not/,"I've noticed that somewhere in the past five years there has been a focus on discouraging ""bullying"" at schools. Now when I say that they are discouraging ""bullies"" I don't mean that they are trying to prevent the straight up assault and battery that those of us who are a little bit older remember from our days at school, but they are cracking down on the everyday teasing and and ridicule to the same degree. 

I'll start by saying I was bullied in school, and of course I didn't like it but that's the point, you're not supposed to enjoy it. Instead of crawling into a shell and hiding from the world I changed the behavior that lead to people making fun of me. I found that I had to do this in order for the teasing to stop because at that time the teachers and faculty weren't on this pop-culture crusade that we see today. I found that after I had done this, that I was actually able to make friends with some of them. This has led me to believe that what is described today as ""bullying"" is in fact the natural behavior of a social species that is aimed at correcting the undesirable behavior in those around us. In case anyone is wondering I was the ""Know it all"" in class who would **constantly** raise my hand at every opportunity but then go off on tangents about topics completely unrelated to the class material just because that's what I wanted to talk about. I actually did a lot of things, but that's the one I look back at and cringe about the most.

If for example a person becomes obsessed with let's say a cartoon about colorful horses, and that person immerses themselves in that universe to the exception of everything else around them even to the point of playing ""dress-up"" at inappropriate times then they **will** be made fun of. The teasing is because that individual's behavior is not normal and his peers recognize this. While that person is in their fantasy world they might be happy but they are not interacting, or learning how to interact, with the people around them. If the school they go to then cracks down on his peers for their reaction thereby removing all negative consequences of his behavior then there will be no motivation for him to stop or change. Suppressing their reactions will not make this individual more likeable to his peers nor will it ""teach anybody about tolerance"". And actually punishing the group will turn their dislike of him into resentment. Now what about this individual? What is he going to do when he grows up and finds out that he doesn't know how to make friends or really communicate at all? 

This is just one scenario, and please don't think I'm just picking on what are essentially victims of marketing. There are kids who lie to make themselves appear cooler, kids who overeat, kids with hygiene problems etc. You could sit back and say that those kids parents should be the ones who are addressing these problems and you might be right. But I say that there must be some reason that the issue isn't being corrected at home and shielding the ""victims"" from the ridicule of their peers removes and entire social correction mechanism. You could point out that bullying has caused kids to kill themselves, I would say that those kids probably had a preexisting condition such as depression that wasn't being addressed properly and sheltering them while they are a kid doesn't help them when they grow up not does it address their possible medical condition. I could go on but I'll wait to see if anyone actually disagrees with me.

I am arguing for it's utility, not it's morality.  I believe that as a nation, we have to be willing to sacrifice our security effectiveness in order to preserve our citizen's rights.

Having said that.  Racial profiling works.  It is not a solution, but it is simply one of the traits law-enforcement should use to prioritize their tasks.  A simple example:

After capturing a known terrorist in the US, the FBI discovered this person has basic phone contact with 100 other people.  The FBI also discovered a plot to blow up something, in the near future. Considering that:
 
* Statistically our domestic terrorist has much higher likelihood in a specific gender, race, ethnicity, and religion. (edit:  People have pointed out this is a false blanket statement and I agree.  I meant it in reference to leads from CT investigation into Muslim terrorist organization.)

* The FBI has no other additional information they can rely on to prioritize the list.

* This is a time sensitive situation.

Given these premises, there is no reason why the FBI shouldn't profile the list of POIs by gender, race, ethnicity, and religion.

Thus, racial profiling has utilities.

Here is the more provocative argument:
If statistically, in a specific area in the US, that white males between the age of 20-30 are murders.  Would it be unreasonable for a police officer patrolling that area to pay more attention to white males between the age of 20-30?   Said police officer is trained to be prepared for all threats.  So for that officer, if he was approached by a 26 year old white male and a 26 year old Asian male at the same time from different direction and he can only choose to observe one, it would be reasonable for him to observe the 26 year old white male because statistically in this local area that is where the threat is likely to be from.

Again, racial profile has utilities.

CMV.

EDIT:  Here are the prevalent arguments so far (and my responses.):

1.  There are other better ways to profile than using race.
(Agreed.  I never claim race is the best way, or even a good way to profile people.  I am claiming it has its use at certain circumstances.  That it is not ""always useless"")

2.  If you racially profile one race.  You let the other races go free.
(For some reason there is a perception that if you racially profile one race to prioritize your investigation, that it means you will **not** investigate the suspects outside of the profile.  Racial profiling (when used correctly) allow you to prioritize tasks, not eliminate tasks.)

3.  Law-enforcement should be fair, racial profiling will unfairly mark one race as criminals.
(I agree with this.  Which is why I don't think racial profiling should be used.  But that doesn't mean it is not effective.  If you can remove 10 murderers of the same race, or 2 murderers per 4 different races, what is more effective?)

4.  Racial profiling creates more criminals by alienating a race.
(This would be a very strong argument if someone can cite a study that can show this is true.  I am having a hard time submitting the idea that seeing your race being targeted by a stereotype, your response is to go commit some more crime to reinforce that idea.  As in:  I just saw my cousin got tossed in jail because he committed a crime.  I am a law-abiding citizen and I just got pulled over by the cops and harassed.  They wasted my time and insulted me in front of my family, but found no reason to arrest me.  Now I am going to go commit a crime because I am angry.)

5. Criminal justice data is wrong.  There is a false conviction rate in the criminal justice system.  If all criminal data is wrong, then any profile based on that statistic is also wrong.
(This is an interesting argument.  But I dismiss it because this argument basically make **all** criminal justice discussion irrelevant.  As in:  You shouldn't have more police presence at a high crime area because your high crime data area is wrong.  So if your argument is that any data you have is fallible because the way the data is corrected is fallible, than no data can ever be used to support any argument.)

6. People will use this incorrectly and make mistakes.
(Mis-using an item doesn't mean it is useless.  Are cars useless because it can kill people?)

Also, see keel_bright's analysis, pretty awesome.

So here we are nearly 2 years after Occupy Wall Street and I'm wondering if the months people spent ""protesting"" accomplished one single thing. Banks are making more money then ever, the people who spent their time protesting most certainly could've done something more constructive.

I saw the protestors at Zucotti Park and when they came to Times Sqaure and I actually felt embarrassed for them. The Zucotti Park protestors looked like a large group of gross homeless people and in Times Square they were really just annoying. My family was visiting and wanted to go to Times Square , unfortunately the protest was so obnoxious and in the way of everything that it took away most of the fun of being there as I'm sure it did for thousands of others. Why did they go to Times Square? Most of those people are tourists, I guess I could understand it being done for attention but at that point no one really cared about them anymore anyway.

Furthermore what was the deal with people getting so mad at the police and the arrests that were being made? Some of the headlines and coverage made it seem like the protestors were enemies with the police. The police and banks are so far apart, it just split the attention and distracted people from their real cause. There was no reason for the police to be hated on in the manner that they were.

There's a reason that banks make so much money, everyone needs a bank at some point in their lives. You can't complain about big banks and then take out student loans to pay for your college education, it's not the banks fault that college costs so much but at least they are providing you with the opportunity to attend. Sooner or later I bet every one of those protestors will walk into a big bank and get a mortgage, open an account, or use some service from the very people that they are against. Bankers are an intelligent group and a lot of them work very hard to get to the positions they have.

The issue of **""consent.""** But I believe that animals are in a position to be able to respond back and clearly show whether they're uncomfortable when you're doing something, or not.

Animals are not bound by law (consciously anyways) to refrain from attacking you, getting frustrated, annoyed, or anything, if you were to take them out of their comfort zone. So I believe unless an animal's behavior implies ""no,"" that it should be acceptable, and if somebody continues to have sex with an animal who implies ""no,"" it will be obvious from signs of trauma stemming from the animal, and should be classified under animal abuse.

There's also an argument I heard, **""They don't have a conscious grasp of sex, so that means they can not consent, meaning it's not okay!""** I am of the belief that, as long as it is not harming the animal, whether an animal knows what you're doing or not is completely irrelevant.

I personally do not practice bestiality, nor do I want to, nor have I ever wanted to. But to me, it just doesn't seem like a bad thing.

I see this censorship as the first step towards a censored internet or at least a catered internet where anything beyond social media needs to be applied for and a register setup for those who have requested access to it. Now people already have to call their provider and ask for access to porn, a humiliating experience for a lot of people. What people do while watching porn is deeply personal and an intimate moment, asking for it in an official capacity can be near on impossible. Married folk might not want their partner to know that they mastubate to porn, imagine what would happen when the account info comes through with ""access to adult sites allowed by request"" on the information.

A lonely guy, not had sex in months, doesn't have the porn online anymore so he thinks about his workmates, over time he starts to see his work mates in the same way we might see porn stars, this leads to him not seeing them as people but the porn stars of his imagination, etc etc

I.e.http://www.mybaycity.com/scripts/p3_v2/P3V3-0200.cfm?P3_ArticleID=7070

My understanding is that this flag was created to represent the short lived confederate states of america. This flag, which represents the CSA, then represents everything the CSA stood for I.e. states rights to decide if slavery is legal. I cannot think of a scenario where flying this flag represents anything other than racism. While any number of reasons could be argued as to why the civil war was fought, its obvious slavery was a main cause. A cause the CSA stood firmly behind. 

Do people fly the flag as a sense of regional pride? If so is there no other symbol to relate to other than the Confederate flag? One that is intrinsically tied to the subjugation and purchasing of people.

Why is someone, who has fought in bloody, useless, costly combats, such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, deemed a hero? CMV...

**Edit**: I should clarify some aspects of my belief in this regard. I do not mind soldiers, nor do I view them as despicable human beings, but rather a normal person. I acknowledge what they do is hard work, even if I don't agree with what they do; I just feel hailing them as heroes and almost deifying them is a tad over the top. Thanks for the good, thought-provoking responses everyone! Keep them coming.

**Thoughts**: Having read the various comments on here, it is impossible for me to reply to each one individually, but here is what I've taken out so far:

* As someone people have said, ""hero"" may be too strong a term, but it is probably the best term we have. Although definitions vary, and it's an abstract topic, ""hero"" is a sufficient word to describe the appreciation we should show.

* Soldiers may not necessarily be heroes because of the wars they fight in/their intent, but rather because they avoid us having to do it for ourselves, and can be available for a situation that truly poses us a threat.

* While wars and conflicts may have bad motives or questionable intents, those who fight should still be respected, as they are willing to sacrifice their life for their country's needs.

***Update***: ∆ My view is *sort* of changed... My thoughts are along the line of, it's not the soldier's fault that they have to fight the war; it's a war the government decided they'd have to fight. Therefore, it isn't fair to say the soldier isn't doing something (gulp) heroic, because then they prevent random citizens from having to fight on the behalf of our government.

CMV",typewriters305,175,33,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jyj99/i_think_that_job_creators_are_the_worst_people_to/,"I've come to this view through a lot of reading, but also through my relationship with my wealthy job-creating grandfather, and I know it's a popular view here on reddit. 

I've been reading economics and business news/books fervently since 2008, and recently I read through Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson as well as Galbraith's Great Crash 1929. The resounding message from both of these books (Hazlitt with a positive view, Galbraith with a negative) is that people embedded in the Wall Street/Economist's lifestyle cares first and foremost about personal accumulation of wealth, beyond that almost nothing matters. They also seem to have a detached (according to Charles Murray's Coming Apart) and simplistic view of the world which revolves solely about the exchange of money. Take Hazlitt's argument that ""there is always work to be done."" This may be in fact true, but that doesn't mean there's always a paycheck to be had for that work. We know that argument to be patently false because we've all had to struggle finding a job. Just because work was available to be done did not mean I was going to get paid for it, you have to connect payee to payer. However, if you subscribe to Hazlitt's view, it's clear that anyone without a job is just to lazy to do work. 

My grandfather has echoed this economy-centric view, often repeating ""of you get the economy right, you get everything right."" He recently made the argument that ""a man's voice in government ought to be determined by his resources"", meaning he sees no problem with Citizens United allowing infinite anonymous fundraising for politicians since that is just the wealthy adding their resources to their vote. 

I've seen him interact with his family and friends and, though he is a very intelligent guy, I've heard him say the most disconnected and insane views of what exactly market forces are and how they can work to reign in health care, welfare, and education spending ""if we just privatize and deregulate (or rather choose ""the right regulations"") and expose those structures to market forces. 

He refuses to believe that there are people who die from lack of insurance (as a study from Harvard points out about 45,000/yr do), is firmly against raising the minimum wage in spite of having no concept of living expenses or the buying power of a few dollars an hr. He is certain that racism and real poverty no longer exist, though he's never been outside of his wealthy white and yacht-going community. 

If the rest of the job-creating community is at all similar to my grandfather, then they should not even be allowed near a plutocratic democracy. 

I understand that a democracy is made up of people, each of whom think their thing is the most important thing, but I think that the particular disconnectedness of 1% ers and job creators is dangerous, especially to everyone who is not living within that community. 

TL;DR - The wealthy/job creators seem to be dangerously disconnected from the real world, monomaniacal, and megalomaniacal. So they are the worst people to have a substantial/enhanced/plutocratic voice in the way government is run, at least in the US.

A David vs. Goliath story with the lone senator as the hero.

However, I feel that the filibuster is a failure of democracy because it makes the majority opinion irrelevant when any one person, in the minority, has the power to unilaterally derail any legislation.  Also, the modern day filibuster is rarely Mr. Smith goes to Washington style with one person standing and reading the phone-book for 12 hours - in the US senate, a filibuster can literally be phoned-in without the objecting senator even being present or talking, they can have their staff object on their behalf, and delay a bill for ""debate"" for weeks.

To be clear, I object to filibustering always.  I will admit that it has been used to stop things I opposed such things as ANWAR oil drilling and the Texas state senate abortion clinic reform; But I would rather they had been approved through the majority-rule system that the senate was founded on, rather than stopped by a method of unilateral blockading.

I may be sheltered to this argument, because until recently I thought that any sensible person would agree.

The [bestof](http://redd.it/1fw77t) thread and the [depthhub](http://redd.it/1fw23d) thread both generated interesting conversation and a lot of interest in our subreddit.

With that being said, I would like to welcome any new subscriber who found this subreddit through /u/161719's excellent comment. I would also like to take this time to remind everyone that in order to keep this subreddit high quality and encourage good discussion, we need to abide by the rules in the sidebar. Please take the short time to familiarize yourself with these rules! You should also feel free to browse our our [wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/index) which includes a list of [popular topics](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/populartopics). 

**Due to the huge influx of users, we've temporarily disabled the posting of new threads. We'll enable new threads after the traffic has died down a little bit.**

I'll update with traffic stats once we have them (no real-time data available). 

**EDIT 1  (9:15pm CDT)**: Excellent additional info from moderator /u/TryUsingScience :

&gt;I'd also like to remind y'all that even though your moderators are a team of hyper-intelligent robots who never sleep, we do occasionally miss things. Especially when there's a huge influx of new users who don't know the rules.

&gt;You can help us out by using the **report** button for rule-breaking comments and threads, and also by hitting [**message the moderators**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fchangemyview) and sending us a link to the thing you reported. (A link is helpful, because reports are anonymous. If you just say ""I reported a thing"" we have no idea which report in the queue is yours.) You don't have to message us for every report, but if you do, we will see it sooner, and we'll tell you why we removed it or why we don't think it should be removed.

**EDIT 2  (9:15pm CDT)**: Also note that /u/DeltaBot will probably crash and until DeltaBot v2 is running, the only mod who has the ability to restart him is /u/Snorrrlax, so if you've been awarded a delta and aren't seeing it show up, send us a message and we'll get to it as soon as we can. 

**EDIT 3 (10:00pm CDT)**: As of right now the mods are likely going to keep submissions turned off until at least tomorrow morning (US time) as the bestof link is currently #1 on the frontpage of reddit.  

**EDIT 4 (11:30pm CDT)**: The bestof link is currently down to #4 on the frontpage. Also, /u/Solambulo wants us to remind everyone (veteran CMVers and newcomers alike) of the following:

&gt;Would you please remind everyone that this is ""change my view"", not ""challenge my view""?

&gt;The purpose of this subreddit is:

&gt;For people who have an opinion on something but accept that they may be wrong or want help changing their view.

&gt;This isn't for pitting your view against others', it's for changing a view you don't fully believe in or would like to change.

The best part is that reported posts have been very minimal, so either everyone is abiding by the rules or no one is reporting things. I'll assume the former. 

**The bestof link is currently still #31 on the frontpage. I'm going to leave submissions closed because I've got an appointment in about 90 minutes and (as far as I know) I'm the only mod up and active right now.

There may be evidence that a God similar to the one described in the bible does not exist, but there is no evidence that some other being or deity or whatever, does not control anything and everything in the universe.

Change my view!

EDIT: Since a lot of people are arguing the definition of Athiesm. I'm going to post what I basically use as definition of Atheism and Agnosticism.

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism
http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnostic

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athiests
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic

If you believe in a differing definition, so be it. That's fine, and your logic may very well coincide with mine, but just differ in terminology. But for the sake of this CMV, that's what they will be defined as (Since definitions can very well vary)

EDIT: Since a lot of you have used, agnostic atheist or Gnostic atheist and the such. I am talking about Gnostic atheists. 

EDIT: Thank you guys all for replying. I've come to the conclusion of this. Athiests pretty much == agnostics. Which I guess is a change of view.

First of all, I don't think that the state should be allowed to force the prisoners to donate organs. That would create an added incentive to giving people the death sentence. Jurors may even take that into consideration when pondering their verdict. These effects all want to be avoided in case of abuse.

There is however the problem that people may try to become organ donors to gain sympathy and show that they've somehow changed. I think that issue can be fixed by only giving them the option to become organ donors a short period before the actual execution, after all sentencing as been done.

Of course we wouldn't be able to poison the crap out of their bodies as a form of execution anymore, but I don't think people were particularly attached to that form of execution. I'm sure they can figure out a way to humanely kill someone while preserving their organs.

We would also have to make sure that they're disease free and their organs are qualified for donation, but I think doctors have to do that anyway, so I don't think that will be a big issue.

1370365848.0,144,self.changemyview,1fnufx,"I am anthropocentric, meaning that my end goal in life is the well-being of humanity, and this should not be slowed down by animal rights. CMV",elpekardo,196,52,124,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fnufx/i_am_anthropocentric_meaning_that_my_end_goal_in/,"This is a response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fn725/i_feel_that_animals_should_be_treated_equally_to/) post, and I was hoping to offer an opposite viewpoint. I've had this argument with some of my environmentalist and vegetarian friends, though I was hoping to find more compelling arguments here.

My basic argument is that plants and animals are not self-aware. They cannot have dreams and aspirations like we do, and cannot strive to be self-actualized like humans can. They can only fulfill the base (and I suppose some could argue the second or even third) level of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). So because of this, I say we grant animals, lets say a chicken, everything it needs to fulfill those requirements. However, chickens will never live long enough to actually change the world or become self-actualized, so what's the problem with slaughtering them earlier in life if it benefits humanity?

My friend says he wishes farmers would allow their chickens to live long, ""fulfilling"" lives, because chickens can live five times longer than what we allow them to. But if this farmer allows his chickens to live five times longer, he's making five times less money, and will surely go out of business. If we enacted laws like this, thousands of people would lose their jobs because chicken farming would not be lucrative anymore. Is that really worth letting chickens walk around doing nothing for a little longer? This farmer could have had dreams and aspirations, and now he's broke and on the street because of so-called ""animal rights"".

My friend also says that anthropocentrism is bad for the environment, but I think he confuses Anthropocentrism vs Biocentrism with Stupid Anthropocentrism vs Smart Anthropocentrism. For example, a stupid anthropocentrist would cut down all the trees because he wants wood to build a house, then would die from the floods and mudslides that would come because of the lack of roots absorbing the water from the dirt and holding the earth in place. A smart anthropocentrist would do his research and see that problem beforehand, then only cut down an acceptable number of trees and replant the ones he cut down so the environment sustains.

It just seems that some people think I can't possibly care about the environment if I put the needs of humans as my first priority. Saving the environment with selfish reasons is just as effective as any other method, just less direct. People *will* do their part for the environment once they see how it affects them, we just haven't really got there yet. For example, in the past 50 years, the amount of smokers in Canada has drastically decreased, because of a 3-step thought process:

1. Smoking cigarettes can give you cancer.
2. Cancer is bad.
3. Therefore, don't smoke cigarettes.

It's only a slightly more complicated thought-process to reduce our carbon emissions for selfish reasons:

1. Carbon and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can trigger climate change.
2. Climate change can result in an increase in environmental disasters such as tsunamis and hurricanes.
3. Tsunamis and hurricanes are bad.
4. Therefore, we should reduce our carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.

So clearly, it's a bit more complicated than the first one, but environmental science has only really been a major discipline since the 1960s, so it's only a matter of time before more people see the environment as an issue that really affects humans. We don't need to be ""biocentric"" to see that protecting the environment is an important issue. We're a selfish species, and that's okay.

So CMV please!

Now I understand that many of these views are simply cultural and are not inherent human traits, but I would like to frame these points in the realm of modern western culture.

I think females have higher value in western society because: 

- Men must pay up at parties, bars, and other social settings while women get in cheap or free. Women are simply more desirable to have at social settings than men are.

- The sex industry serves men. In a capitalist society, this translates to women being a scarcity and in demand. Excuse the crudeness, but there is the saying ""pussy costs money, but dick is free.""

- There are 105 men for every 100 women born. In the most active and productive years of their lives, men outnumber women, thus adding to the value of being female.

- Women are given a substantial amount of attention in certain communities, like Reddit and tech-related interests. Because of this, women interested in sports, gaming, science, or other male-dominated areas are special and desirable. I cannot think of equivalent communities where men are as ""in demand"" and desirable. 

- There are three times as many Male-to-Female trans operations than there are Female-to-Male [questionable statistic]. I see this as women being the more desirable gender.

- Women definitively represent sexually desire, even to other women. The amount of bi-sexual women strongly outnumbers the amount of bi-sexual men [anecdotal observation]. A woman's body is considered sexy and beautiful; a man's is not.

- The image of a woman is more valuable than one of a man. For example, Reddit posts with attractive women in them become much more popular than they would be otherwise. 

- The old saying ""women and children first"" reinforces the value of females over males. Society prefers that women live over men. We would rather send our men to war and have men do dangerous jobs.

- Female crime victims get more media attention than male ones. 

- Similarly, female social issues get more media attention. Feminism, breast cancer, glass ceiling, etc. Male issues do not get this much attention.

- Simply that men are seen as the ""default"" human being implies that women are special.

- For a man to gain value, he must prove himself. Women have more value by default due to their scarcity and sexual desirability.

I feel that there is something very wrong with thinking this way, but no matter how much I've tried to convince myself otherwise, I can't see past it. As a man, I don't feel valued or desired and it saddens me. It is difficult to discuss this in other communities without being seen as juvenile or troll-bait for gender wars, so I hope this subreddit can help!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi all,

For for about 8 years now I've been growing more and more opposed to wealth redistribution and social welfare. I'm 26 and paying 37% income tax (second highest bracket in Australia - the next and final is $180,001 per year income) plus 10% GST on every purchase, plus the mark up on importation of overseas made products, which is to say that more than half my income gets taken in direct taxation... yet I have no kids (not paying for schools), have private health insurance, etc etc - I'm sure you get the idea.

More so, if I were to lose my job and fall back on welfare the payment is so low that (assuming I had zero savings) I would lose everything and become homeless almost immediately - my rent alone is more than the unemployment payment, and add to that the loan repayment on my modest car (Toyota Corolla) I'd be totally rooted. Centrelink (welfare department) is worthless to me.

Here's an interactive break down of Australia's budget: http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-09/interactive-budget-2013-where-will-your-tax-go/4682404

Now, looking at that, a person earning $150,000* would be paying $55500 total tax which goes to...

 - $19247.4 to social welfare.

 - $1221 to public housing.

 - $7050 to health (on top of their almost mandatory private health care).

 - $3244 for education (when they may or may not have kids, and may or may not send them to a private school, also note that MORE is spent by State governments as well, I am only showing Federal budget numbers here).

 - An additional 10% of every dollar which goes to the State governments, who in turn piss it away on other things.

That money could be put in to a savings account and saved towards:

 a) Paying for future costs, such as unexpected unemployment or illness.

 b) Paying for retirement.

 c) Generating wealth, for example buying homes or investing in businesses.

I see a combination of a minimalistic government coupled with a user pays system of private service delivery as being a much more fair system. I'm curious to hear what you have to say about the merits of social welfare, and why the government knows how to spend my money better than I do.


*Note that's not what I earn, but it is a nice round figure to do math with.

Negative effects:

* Almost doubles student loans
* It delays you from entering the workforce earlier, preventing you from paying off your loans sooner and paying more in interest.
* The value of the classes are limited. Most of these classes are introductory and don't teach any discernible skill (related to the career you want to enter)

Liberal arts classes might have some benefit, but it shouldn't be forced on you. It is an extremely poor investment and should be made optional like taking honors classes. The priority should be your major, anything else is just extra and shouldn't be required. I have heard no good reason from colleges why liberal arts is necessary, and I think their objective is not to be better my education, but to get me to pay more tuition.

edit: A common theme i'm seeing in the responses is that even though a student might hate taking another course (such as math) they felt they benefited from it, and that liberal arts gives a 'well-rounded' education. I think this can be accomplished without being forced to pay for several courses that have nothing to do with your major. I'm not saying liberal arts should be abolished, just that it shouldn't be mandatory. I am capable of reading and learning on my own (which I do) and I shouldn't be forced to pay for those courses just because other students aren't motivated to learn and need to be forced to go outside their comfort zone.

I agree that a 'well-rounded' education is a good thing. I understand that many people have benefited from getting a liberal arts education. But I feel this can be accomplished without forcing a student to pay for courses that are outside one's major.

I believed it was wrong and pushed out my own view instead. I believe this to be true for several reasons that I will divide into two topics. (Note: I am a non-white female, as one would guess.)

1. Why a man.
2. Why being white.

~~I believe it is easier to be a man because:

* **Nobody is afraid of women.** If I go out late at night, there has to be a trusted man with me. There are rapists at night, or if I get into an accident, who's going to change my tire? If I want to go travel extensively in a foreign country, especially the considered ""third world"" country, it's too dangerous. I am a woman, and I am American, and everyone knows how to to take advantage of that. 

* **If I sleep around, I am a slut. If a man sleeps around, he is a stud.** No one gets very angry if a man abandons the baby he fathered. Yet, if I a woman knows that she won't be able to handle this baby, or if it was born out of rape, there are plenty of states where I wouldn't be able to abort it. If I even have sex with one person before they commit their entire being to me (aka: marriage), it's a risk. What if a mistake happens and I get pregnant?

* **Men have freedom of opportunity.** There are still many lucrative professions that are anti-women. Tech and Engineering are the most popular ones. I don't want to go in them, but I'm not sure if it's because of the societal view placed upon me, that I can not, or if it really is an independent choice. Some people may say that if I really wanted to, I could still be go into tech or engineering, but there are extra difficulties involved that make one ask -- is it worth it?

* **Men aren't objectified.** If I go anywhere looking fashionable and attractive, I will get harassed. If a man goes out with fashion and taste, he won't. (Chances are, that he won't, at least.) Even women see fashionable, tasteful women as bad for society; harlots.

* (This one is a bit humorous, but still.) **Men don't have periods.** ~~

**I now believe that men and women face different problems and that's okay. If you would still like to comment about this, feel free to, but know that my mind is changed.** 

I'm sure that there are other things, but I thought these covered some broad areas regarding societal views. Now here's why I think being white is easier in my country, America.

* **In Fortune 500 companies, only 18 CEOs are of another race.** [(source)](http://www.diversityinc.com/diversity-facts/wheres-the-diversity-in-fortune-500-ceos/)

* **There is still heavy racism against anyone who isn't white.** I know a lot of people say that there is racism if you're white, but how much of it is joking? My parents are immigrants, and although they speak English quite well, they still have an awkward wording and an unnatural tone of speech. When we go out, there are people who downright disrespect my mom because she is not white and she doesn't speak like she's white. There was racism in her workplace, at stores, at restaurants from the waiters/waitresses, and at job interviews. 

* **[There are too many Asians at top colleges.](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/education/edlife/07asian.html?em&amp;ex=1168318800&amp;en=c1659d374db49dfa&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;_r=0)** We still don't know if there is a real bias against Asians at top colleges, and if it will change prospects. I know that there was a problem, too many whites at colleges, but that was due to blatant racism against minorities. There were minorities who outperformed the white student, and the colleges rejected them because they were a minority. Now, we see too many minorities outranking white students, and they must be stopped!

* **Religious tolerance is insanely low.** I don't know if this really counts as a racial issue, but I think it counts. If you're even remotely Middle Eastern, you will get picked on for being Muslim, regardless of whether or not you are Muslim. Even if you're Indian, which is far away from Iraq/Iran/Afghanistan, you will get picked on for being the evil Muslims who have invaded ""our country."" [Here's a really recent example. Sikhs are NOT Muslim.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh_shooting) Even if they were Muslim, that doesn't account for the racism that is experienced on a daily basis.

This concludes my reasons. I've believed this for a very long time. When I was 10, I rejected everything and named myself a white male. At that time, I didn't even know about half of these reasons, at least consciously. But I hope this was coherent and supported enough that you will CMV.

A view-changer posts a well written, view changing comment that is above average in quality. The OP gives them a delta. Then maybe another CMVer posts a delta because they just realised that they had the same view as OP and that view has just been changed. So far, so good. 

Then the post is upvoted to the top of the sub. A few more people from the sub comment deltas. Then the post gets cross-posted to /r/bestof or a similar subreddit, and a flood of users arrive. They see multiple deltas posted, and then literally dozens of newly-arrived users comment deltas, following the example of the few earlier commenters.

I grew up in a very healthy environment with great parents. I had very good self esteem compared to my peers, though I haven't realized that until much later. I was a tomboy and most of my friends were men. But I was also sexist. I thought that being more like men made me better than other women. Together with my male friends I would laugh at how stupid women were. I would look down on my friends girlfriends because they were so ""emotional"" and didn't understand any of the ""guy stuff"" that I did with my friends. I didn't give a flying fuck about equality because I never had any problems in my life. I felt that if women have shitty lives it must be their own faults.

At 20 my life was excellent. I had a good job with good pay and making my way up the corporate ladder. I had just become manager. Then I met him. We were in love and it started great. We had the same interests, the sex was great. Everything was great. But what I didn't realize was that gradually, bit by bit he was breaking me. 

The first incident I remember was about 2 months in to our relationship. I tried to kiss his cheek in public and he put his hand up and shoved my face away. I was mortified. But I was also in love. I brushed it off. Unfortunately, it continued and it got a lot worse. He had a habit of finding the little faults in everyone and blowing them up to huge character flaws. He convinced me that all my friends were idiots, so we stopped hanging out with them. He didn't have any friends so that meant we were always alone, except when I was at work. He also managed to convince me that my job was pathetic and pointless. It didn't happen over night but gradually I started to become more anxious and confused. Every time I was happy he would find a way to bring me down. If I ever cried he accused me of being self absorbed and pathetic. Often he explained how I was the cause of all my problems. Problems that I never had before I met him, but I didn't realize that then. I used to love my job. Now I got panic attacks almost every morning before I left for work.

After about a year I was walking on eggshells. It was like my mind was constantly spinning 24 hours a day trying to figure out how to behave so that he would be happy and not mean. Eventually I had to go on sick leave from work. I went to more than one doctor trying to figure out what was wrong with me. They didn't find anything. So I started searching online. I searched for ""mental illness"", ""anxiety"" and similar things. Eventually I ended up on a website for abused women. I read it and finally I understood what was happening to me. He was trying to break me so that he could control me. And I stayed because I was trying to fix him.

I went back to my job for 6 months, then I quit my job and started gender studies at the university. I went through a few years of reconsidering everything I had done in the past. I realized that when I was young I had been an ignorant and sexist person. I also realized that if I hadn't found feminism, I would have wasted my whole life trying to help someone who was abusing me. There are a lot of details to this process I went through, I don't feel there is room for all of it here but I came out convinced I was a feminist.

I'm well aware that abuse doesn't only happen to women. But if it wasn't for feminism, domestic abuse would still have been considered a ""family matter"" in which the police shouldn't get involved. Rape within marriage would still be legal and the research and information on partner abuse would not be where it is today.

1373425540.0,122,self.changemyview,1hzdr7,"Joyce's Ulysses is not a great book, and absolutely does not deserve the acclaim it has received. CMV",NoBromo1,167,45,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hzdr7/joyces_ulysses_is_not_a_great_book_and_absolutely/,"I consistently work through many literature classics, and recently I finally made my way to Ulysses. I refer to Ulysses itself as a work and not Joyce himself because I believe him to be a very capable author. His Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man is phenomenal, and I believe a much superior work to Ulysses (I'm illustrating a point, but let's not take the debate there).  Perhaps, because of his style alone, it is worthy of the quantity of discussion that followed in the near-century since its publishing. However, it should absolutely never have been referred to as the greatest book of all time, let alone a ""great"" book. 

There is a great deal of difficulty in trying to fairly gauge a work - there must be a distinction between Joyce, Ulysses, and the fans: it is natural for people to criticize a thing more if they do not like the followers or its position in the world. I have read it and disliked it, but the motives for its positive reception are somewhat of a mystery, so I suppose I have to equally address the fans in order to understand the positive feelings towards it. 

There is some good to be said about it. It has some worthy quotes, but nearly no book is without them. Every author has written at least one remarkable sentence, if all-too-often by accident. These are an incredible minority in the text.  

In the Ulysses Annotations by Gifford and Seidman, Chapter One, roughly 20 pages in my version, has 197 footnotes. One-hundred-ninety-seven footnotes. Provided you even use these, they do little to clarify whatever is currently happening in the text.  Even then, what on Earth is a book doing with this many annotations? I do enjoy relatively obscure references, but let's make a distinction between ""good"" pretentious and ""bad"" pretentious. I enjoy good pretentious, and by this I usually mean a handful of difficult references that complement or improve the narrative or theme. Bad pretentious is a sort of pseudo-intellectualism, which is more pretentiousness for the sake of being pretentious. A quote at the bottom illustrates my point better. Ulysses makes hundreds of references to things for the sake of referencing them, as if Joyce entered subjects from an encyclopedia at random. 

Here I'd like to address two things - a more subjective, harsher criticism of Ulysses and some of its admirers and the types of comments I'd like to avoid and negate. I will be making some small exaggerations so-as to better convey some of my distaste for the book. So, then. One of the reasons Ulysses has been so admired is because it caters heavily to pseudo-intellectuals. There is nothing to ""get"" out of Ulysses, and the admirers of it like to pretend they have a deeper understanding of it than others; one of the merits of the work is that it caters to a superiority complex. The work is ""comprehensible"", but only to a certain point - the admirers pretend it goes much further. I respect the use of steam of consciousness, but it was not enough to carry an entire novel, let alone chapter in the free-reign form Joyce gave it in Ulysses (vis-a-vis especially Portrait of an Artist, wherein it was much more effective and contained).   

It's necessary to admit to many of the difficulties of this sort of conversation. Appraising literature, like many other art forms, is highly subjective. I'd like to make a point against myself. One question that could somewhat easily toss much of my argument aside is this - ""Who cares if people esteem this book much higher than you do? As you said, literary appraisal is subjective. Why not just move on?"" The first point I would respond with is that I suppose that is just my personality - I have read hundreds of classics and studied many of them pretty thoroughly. Many of the works that have been called the greatest novels are typically worthy of this praise - The Brothers Karamazov, War and Peace, Moby Dick, although I think Dostoevsky wins out of these. Even the lesser notable contenders have some considerable merit to this claim. In Ulysses, however, I can find none of it. I would like to compare the work to many other modern artists, but I do not want to sidetrack the discussion.  Quite simply, I'll see if anyone can reasonably explain the book's merit for a bit longer, as well as more research on my own. In a day or two, Ulysses will be left behind for me as an unfortunate waste until we ever accidentally meet again. 

Some final thoughts: This post absolutely does not do my criticism justice, as it would take closer to 10-20+ pages to illustrate some of my points. This would not make for a good Reddit question. Additionally, you have noticed I did not make citations. I do not want to make this criticism into a novel, as its length is intimidating for a Reddit post as-is. If requested, I will make citations to better illustrate my points.  Before these appear, I will end with addressing the obvious danger of citations. In a text this big, of course I and several comments will be making biased citations to prove our respective points; however, I do believe that my criticisms apply to the majority of the text, and will illustrate this point if wanted. 

I'll end with a quote from Nietzsche's Joyful Wisdom that summarizes my feelings well towards Ulysses.
""He who knows that he is profound strives for clearness; he who would like to appear profound to the multitude strives for obscurity. The multitude thinks everything profound of which it cannot see the bottom; it is so timid and goes so unwillingly into the water.""  173

Tl;dr Ulysses is not a great book. Joyce's style made for an interesting experiment, but it was through-and-through a failure. The free-reign Joyce gave his use of stream of consciousness led to an erratic, poor work. 


**Edit**: I removed a few antagonistic remarks to potential comments that seemed inappropriate. As I mention in a few places in the comments, I am fairly new to this subreddit and I do not like how my original post reads. I'll just quote from a reply I left below:  ""I had tried this before in another subreddit, and was met with half-assed witticisms as responses and little depth. I mention this because I feel as though it led to the more ""antagonistic"" style of my original post rather than taking a more appropriate scholarly approach."" So, again, I apologize for strains of left-over bitterness that can still be found in my original post. I am not too familiar with this subreddit and sincerely did not expect such fantastic responses. 

**Edit 2** Since there is so much to be said on the topic, I'd like to direct to a few responses I've made to clear up some of my position. In response to AnxiousPolitics, I quoted a few paragraphs from Ulysses and pointed out some criticisms I have of them, and the remainder of the book would face similar criticisms.
On top of this, users AnxiousPolitics and BonChicBonScott have both set me off in the direction of changing my mind; I am not quite there yet, but I am much closer than I was before. I will elaborate on these points tomorrow. 

**Edit 3** Returning to this for the last time of the night, I'd like to try something that would put me in a new perspective. I will try to find an appropriate passage tomorrow, but in the mean time, I feel like this would pretty much finalize me changing my mind (considerably, at least): If you can find one of the most ""difficult"" passages in the book (again, I'll try to find a good one tomorrow), one full of the things I've referred to in some comments - like obscure and seemingly unexplained references, lack of apparent chronological sentences (an example, this seems almost necessarily part of stream of consciousness writing), cryptic or meaningless phrases (not that the phrase itself is meaningless - but I mean a phrase you would imagine I would find meaningless), etc - and explain, justify, or redeem a passage like that, I feel as though I'd almost be necessarily guaranteed to change my mind. The larger paragraph I used in response to AnxiousPolitics is good, but not quite problematic enough. I tried to emphasize words such as ""apparent"" and ""seemingly"" in this edit in order to illustrate that whatever passage comes up would pass under such criticism by myself, but not to someone else that may see the work differently.

CMV,Philofadelphia,165,42,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gujyr/i_believe_pick_up_artistry_is_mostly_bullshit_cmv/,"I believe Pick Up Artistry is mostly Bullshit. I've read The Game and, a lot of stuff on /r/seduction and, came to the conclusion it's mostly Bullshit. PUAs have decent advice like [Shown Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11piau/above_the_game_part_1_primer_on_who_you_will/)
 like be genuine, confident, honest, being exciting and, not apologizing for being yourself. All that sounds like decent advice but, then there's this.
&gt;1) Go someplace relaxing where you can be all alone. Bring a pen and a notebook. Ponder deeply and visualize the man you want to be 90 days from now. Catalog your life and remove anything and everything that doesn't fit this new image you have for yourself. Write this all down. Examples: Stop wasting time playing pointless video games, stop watching useless TV, stop pointless web browsing. Cut out friends who harm your self-image.

That's great. I'll cutoff a possible lifelong friendship because, my friend might make unappealing to women. I'd rather just date someone who was mutual friend or, ask them to watch their behavior around the girl I'm trying to get with then cut them off. It's also, typically a non issue, I can just not go out to meet women with said friend, or, not have my hypothetical GF hang around him. I don't think I need to stop watching TV either in fact I think it's a plus, I can be up to date with popculture and, make small talk about newest shows and, see what we have in common. As far as video games go why do I need to give them up? If it's a matter of them being unappealing then why Shouldn't I just try and, find women who are into Gaming?

Another thing that I declare shenanigans on is the [""shit test""](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/iq6nx/common_shit_tests_and_how_to_defuse_them/) You'd sound like a complete douchebag using those. Some of those are, basic questions you ask to get to know each other. If a woman I'm trying to get with or, I'm with is mad I'm supposed to write it off with humor instead of talking it out with her? How is brushing off questions being honest or, genuine? 

[Then there's this shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1dd13a/above_the_game_part_3_body_language_how_to/)
&gt;To quote Rob Judge, ""Personal space is for pussies."" I already told you that the most successful seducers are those who can't keep their hands off of women. Well you're not gonna be able to do that if you aren't in close! Shake her hand, hold the handshake for just slightly longer than most guys would, and close the gap between you and the girl until you can feel the sexual tension thicken up. This is how you demonstrate intent in your approach. 
Trust me, if you've got that ""I'd fuck me"" smirk on your face, standing tall, holding eye contact, right up closer to the girl than most guys, she will KNOW that you desire her and want to get to know her better. You can literally say anything at this point and you've made a direct approach. Congrats! Speaking of approaching...

Most women on Reddit, Tumblr and, IRL have said they don't like this  along with physical contact because, it's creepy. Yet some how I'm a pussy for not giving women space. 

[There's too much &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; to go around for this section but, I'll try and, elaborate on what my problems are.](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1dvnem/above_the_game_part_7_physical_escalation_sex/)

&gt;The concept of ""waiting for signs"" or ""Indicators of Interest"" was commonplace in older pickup theory. It is 100% garbage and needs to be erased from the face of the planet.
Never, ever, ever, wait for a SIGN before you escalate! You will miss out on the vast majority of chances if you sit around waiting for SIGNS. Men are notoriously bad at reading women's minds and body language. Don't think that you're any different. From now on you must ASSUME that she is attracted to you and wants to be ravished. It's a difference in mindset that makes champs champs and chumps chumps.
As stated back in the section on Flirting in Part 5[12] , leading with your body is a very effective form of flirting. It is YOUR JOB, as the man, to lead the interaction. Be playful. Spin her around. Pick her up. Push her away as a tease and then pull her back in. 
Decide that you're going to sit in a position where you can rub her leg and back. Physically pick her up and sit her on your lap. Don't ask for permission. Be dominant. Force her to rebuff your advances.
If you adopt this mindset, you will create opportunities where ""going in for the kiss"" just feels natural. You'll have her in close, emotions will be charged, and you'll know. Then it's just a matter of manning up and going for the kiss. Even if she rejects your initial advance, you'll have raised your chance of success in the future.
 
This sounds creepy and, women agree with me on it. The part about It being the mans job to flirt and, stuff is sexist to boot.

Also, there's this. 
&gt;Pull out your cock and put her hand on it. Remember, she is letting you do this because you have established yourself as a LEADER. Don't ask for permission, GRAB HER HAND, and put it right on your dick.

WTF? Do these guy's get their moves from Porn? That's incredibly rapey and, sounds like a great way to get Falcon Punched in the gens.

Part of the reason I think this is bullshit is because, I'm Pansexual so, I can empathize a bit with women when it comes to dating and, I've got to say I would not want date a guy who did any of these things. If he did these while we were dating I'd dump him.

So what does it change to NOT let them get married? If an inbred child is born, isn't it better for him to be protected by the law and have both of his parents recognized?

* A parent would teach their kid to be sexually attracted to them: It's repugnant, BUT does it change ANYTHING to make incestuous marriage illegal? Would that stop any perverted parent?

* It's unethical: that same argument is used against gay marriage by most of its opponents.

* Inbred kids have a higher disease risk: True, but incestuous couples can still have kids without marrying.

[Article 1 section 1](http://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter1.shtml) of the UN Charter states ""To maintain international peace and security"". A state created from acts of terrorism, assassination, and ethnic cleansing from the lands does not to hold to the spirit of the Charter so any support given to Israel was illegal.

These, I believe, refers solely to the long term inhabitants, including Jewish people, of the land not the immigrants, legal and illegal, that showed up and demanded rights they had no claim to. 

The holocaust while terrible did not give any special permissions or rights to the Jewish people. They did not gain the right to claim a land that they had no greater claim to then anyone else.

The US was created in a different time then Israel. If it was created within the framework of today's laws it would be illegal. It however was created in a time where wars were fought to gain land. By both the European settlers and the Natives. This resulted in the Europeans, who were better armed, to take a great deal of land and commit a lot of atrocities. There was however no real legal system that prohibited the atrocities and they were basically common practice by both sides. Non of that make it moral but it does make the founding of the US legal.

Edit: Took some offensive words out for people who can't handle colloquialisms.

Edit2: Additional information

User u/Bastrd_87 requested me to make some connections with what my view is with what my post addresses.

He said I should provide the reasons why I have the belief that flamboyant people aren't really gay, for that to work I must describe my view of gay people and culture. I would summarize it as

&gt;Homosexuals are people who feel sexual attraction for the same sex for yet to be known reasons (or no reason at all). This behavior gathered the hate of people in many cultures and led to the marginalization of gay folks on post-christian cultures. This led to extreme situations of social anxiety and other things, but [here starts my own vision] after the events of 9/11 and the advent of neo-atheism, influential gay people started campaigning without fear of religious persecution and since they are slowly earning the respect they deserve. The problem is that the Media is a dirty, filthy disgusting business when they want to and they have been cashing in, turning homosexuality into a 'trend', like they could fix decades of blatant, explicit prejudice forcing a detrimental view of the gay culture down everyone's throat. This specially vomit-inducing here in Brazil, but I'll explain further if anyone want to. Now we have people who act gay to earn acceptance they can't through being ''''normal''''. This is pretty much like some fanbases that do more harm than good to something. Gay people are working hard to make an acceptable, stable and respectful image and people who are exploiting the stereotypical concept of gay culture are setting things back for them and should be reprehended. Now, I know there are disgusting heterosexual people too, but since people agreed that heterosexuals are the 'norm' or the 'basic everyday people', they don't have anything to prove to anyone or, given their numerical superiority, should be expected to have shitty people.

That's why I believe flamboyant, attention-seeking people that use their sexuality as a social tool (which is natural for humans but should be avoided now that we have the CIVILIZATION to evade that) do not represent the image that gay people are striving for and serve only to disseminate wrong perceptions of sexuality (like all gay people are futile, vain, oversexualized or promiscuous, deceitful, backstabbing and all that jazz) and should be reprehended and reeducated.

PS: I'm trying to change my view so please please go easy on me, I don't really know if I'm offending anyone but that is NOT my intention in ANY WAY.

Edit:

After reading many insightful and well-written arguments that made me think about how society is built and the dynamic structure of cultures, I finally made my mind.

&gt;In the end, it all comes down to personality and ways of defining one's identity. Annoying people and assholes exist in all cultures and always will but luckily they're stuck being a minority that matter so little they have little power in being detrimental to their group, as people who actually care will focus on the good aspects of people and ostracize assholes not because they are 'flaming faggots', but because they are assholes. It even reaches the zone of mating tools and fitting in in some cases, so even if I can't understand it as acceptable behaviors, I can still recognize it as a gimmick for reaching other who are alike and by the end of the day, people grow out of it.

I just feel like men should be in charge. I want to get married, have a couple kids, cook dinner, clean up, etc. It makes me happy and I know I'm far from the only one. I think there's a reason the vast majority of BDSM relationships have men in the dominant role and women in the submissive role. 

The desire for a woman to be submissive to her man is innate and women are wired to be submissive to proper authority in general.  Basically, I think that women are built to prefer men to be in control, but men and women been told for the past ~50 years or so that this isn't acceptable.

I don't think abuse is acceptable, nor am I suggesting that women live their lives wrong and have been corrupted by evil feminism. We as a society do plenty of things that aren't ""natural."" I happen to think this is one of them.

2) Its sexist.

Women are always the first to argue that they can do anything a man can do and seek to be equal in the workforce.....unless it means they have an easier test, apparently.

The fact that a woman would allow themselves to be lowered like this and still argue for equality makes them hypocritical.

I do not believe women are equal. (at the physical level, not in terms of mental ability)

The fact is I understand that men are stronger and more fit than women are. Thats just a fact.

In short; the beef industry messes with our planet a great deal.

So, is it reasonable to stop eating beef altogether? Being an extremely resource intensive product, we could get more of some other livestock product while using less resources.

For example, increased violent behavior as a result of a brain tumor is a documented occurrence. Society HATES the murderer up until the point it's discovered it is the tumor that was causing the behavior, not the natural brain of the person. Society has somewhat forgiven this person because they did not truly ""choose"" the actions they ended up taking.


Next, I should say that based on a long period of examining the evidence, I've come to the conclusion that free-will is an illusion. Every ""decision"" we make is a product of our mind's makeup at that time interacting with our environment at that time. The makeup of our brain depends on our genetics and our past experiences, **NEITHER of which we chose.** For me, consciousness is just the experience of things that are happening; we don't have the ability to do things not in our nature.

 

Following those two premises, in the same way that the tumor victim did not ""choose"" to get a tumor causing him to murder people no murderer ""chose"" to have the natural mind of a murderer, no rapist ""chose"" to have the natural mind of a rapist. Therefore, I can't see how it's even moral, let alone helpful, to inflict pain on them JUST for the sake of it. An eye for an eye is only helpful in that it could be a deterrent in some cases. What we should be doing is **the course of action that benefits society as a whole the most.** Whether it be rehab, prison, or maybe even the death penalty in cases where it's necessary, the punishment that does the most good should be the answer. 

The masturbation that is ""justice"" is not good for society. All it does is make us feel good, while inflicting pain on a human for no reason.

CMV,InteractionArtist,144,26,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hsou8/if_reddits_serious_subs_could_only_allow/,"Every day the front page has high rated post where the top comments clearly and effectively debunk the main claim made by the headline, image, or link. People that take the time to open the comments page for such posts can easily see that, and based on that make a better informed decision about whether to upvote or downvote the content.

By comparison, upvotes and downvotes made without going to the comments page have no context other than the claims of the page/image linked to, or even worse, the potentially sensationalized post title. The post title is sometimes so sensationalized or confused that it doesn't even accurately reflect the content it links to, but that doesn't always prevent it from winding up on the front page.

Maybe it's satire but it's posted as being serious. Maybe it's an article that though it seems infuriating at first, is easily deflated by someone simply making a level-headed observation that it cites no sources, presents no substantive arguments, and is just some blogger trying to stir up traffic. Maybe it's a spammy inadequate reference hastily excerpted from a more substantive post that has more business being the basis of further discussion. Maybe it's a viral ad trying to game reddit's audience, caught and explained in the comments but subtle enough to get away with title and link alone. Or maybe it's outright false - a result of irresponsible reporting - and in the case of real news about real people, businesses, and places in the world there can even be danger in that incorrect information being further spread to a massive worldwide audience.

Top comments in discussion often raise all of these points, and more, with others in reply even acknowledging in a defeated way that it's no doubt on the fast track to the front page anyway. Presumably this happens from upvotes by people who don't even peek at the top comment, which exposes in plain language that it's misleading, overblown, or plain wrong.

I'm thinking that this could potentially be an attractive subreddit option, like we've recently seen for score hiding (I'm only using that here as an example, not arguing for or against it), to only allow upvotes/downvotes from the comments page of posts, not from the listing of post titles.

Granted, for some subs, like those dedicated to humor content or beautiful photography, this probably does not matter, and would only get in the way. However for the many areas of this site focused on history, science, news, politics, scholarship, and other serious matters (even religion or nonreligion, for subs that aim to elevate serious discussion on the subjects), it seems like this could do away with much of the garbage floating to the top, and help some of the more substantive content, even if only by the displaced garbage.

Am I looking at this all wrong? Perhaps misunderstanding something fundamental about why this would be a horribly bad idea, even for subreddits that strive for informed discussion?

Got alot more posts than I thought it would. I have changed my minds on some aspects of religion, if not most of them. What really made me most realize the issue is that religion isn't the main factor as to the problems I have with it. This means that people that murder for religion have more factors in play than them just being religious. I still don't like theocratic governments in any way though because I think that increases the bad taking place from religion. I guess a little religion won't hurt, even if it's not rational (in most cases).


I grew up fairly religious and went to a private school for most of my young years (pre-school-7th grade). It was a lutheran school and I followed it but not very heavily because it was boring (of course). As I got into high school I started going to a youth group called Young Life which was really fun which made me associate fun with christianity. My parents never really pushed school on me because they told me it was evil and was just to brainwash children into becoming liberals. I realized this was insane after finishing high school, unfortunately the damage was already done to my grades. I am now studying physics and have a 3.9 (compared to a 2.8 in high school) and am a leader in the classrooms.

So here is my view

After realizing how damaging religion was to me personally both mentally, physically, and socially, I have come to equate it as being damaging to everything. I see how religion has single handidly destroyed many countries and am seeing the effects it is having on America now (negative). I have yet to see any single benefit that religion gives to society and all I can see is harm. If religion was eliminated from society, the whole planet would benefit and we could actually move towards real issues (in my opinion). Change my View!

P.S. I am not asking for you to try to convince me of any religion by the way, I study science and know at least most of all religious stories are bullshit. : )

Edit: I have been convinced officially at least that religion had a place at certain times during our history. However, I still feel that if people actually looked for answers instead of assigning the questions to gods, we would have been much better off.

Edit: CriminallySane has changed my opinion that in some instances religion can be beneficial to individuals in tight knit society like certain mormon groups. I can attest to this as well because I know many mormons. It still stands however that any religion that actively searches to take over a government or destroy scientific progress is detrimental to society.

I've had a friend explain it was because certain clothes made a girl feel ""cute"", but I didn't really understand that, either. Basically I feel that wearing revealing clothing = you want people to look. Change my view!  
  
Edit: It has been brought up a few times that they could wear a tank top, short shorts, etc. due to hot weather. The ones I'm thinking of have more to do with those that wear similar clothing in the winter (winters here get pretty cold) which in itself doesn't make much sense to me...

Edit 2: [Excellent link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJVHRJbgLz8) from /u/theubercuber that explains my opinion better than I could. I simply can't understand why some women wouldn't op for something more modest (but equally fashionable!) when complaining about being stared at. By modest I don't mean long-sleeved blouses and jeans. Even yoga pants I understand, some girls like them because they're so comfy. It's just some clothes I can see no other reason for their style other than to reveal, and I don't understand why someone would wear such an item then complain when it does its job.  
  
Edit 3: I've cleared my thoughts, and I guess it comes down to this: Why can't the woman who complains of getting stared at just wear something more modest? If she was wearing a revealing shirt, I really think changing into something less so would definitely help.

1371870800.0,117,self.changemyview,1gu53f,I believe the world -- in total -- would be a better place under a unified government. CMV,DaystarEld,154,37,161,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gu53f/i_believe_the_world_in_total_would_be_a_better/,"First, what I don't mean:

1 - I DON'T mean a unified culture that stamps out all the rich and unique diversity of humanity.  Each individual region should continue to have their own languages, cuisine, religions, art, festivals, etc.

2 - I DON'T mean one of the current countries that exists gets elevated to suddenly rule the world.  Rather it would be a multicultural organization where each region has representatives, but each member is ultimately loyal to the earth/humanity as a whole rather than vying for their country's interests.

3 - I DON'T mean that this unified body is a dictatorship with the ultimate authority to do whatever they want. There would have to be a system of checks and balances between the interests of the countries and the power of the unified government to ensure they only affect matters that are truly international, and do not start micromanaging each country's affairs.

Now that that's out of the way, specifics:

I think all military might and ultimate control of finite resources should be gathered under one banner and used to ensure peace and prosperity for all.  People who enlist in the military would be trained and dispersed around the world, from every country to every country, in a multinational peacekeeping effort. Decisions made regarding distribution of resources would be based on scientific principles and long-term, sustainable goals, rather than what would be the most convenient or most profitable for one business/country or another.

In order to ensure that those in this United Earth Government do not have selfish reasons to seek power, all members of it would have severe personal limits on their individual freedom and prosperity.  This means complete transparency in all financial matters (think an individual internet profile open to all to see), an inability to participate in decisions that directly involve countries of origin (that's what those countries' representatives are for) and so on.  They would be unable to inherit, nor would their children be able to inherit, nor their children's children, anything from the rest of their relatives... they would effectively cut themselves off from the rest of the world and ""start anew"" in terms of lineage.

So, with all that in mind...

First off, my perspective is informed by a bias toward democratic/republic government and secular utilitarian values.  In other words, I think the best (or rather, least bad) form of government is one where the members are elected by the populace, and that the role of society should be to protect and serve the many rather than the few, without discrimination for race, gender, sexuality, all that good stuff.

Secondly, I am fully aware of all the ways this can go horribly, horribly wrong.  My assertion is that it's still the better option than the way our current planet functions, with rampant nationalism that, world wars aside, came unbelievably close to bringing about nuclear winter once before and is likely to at some point in the future again (as the technology for nuclear weapons become harder and harder to restrict and contain).

Third, my primary concern is environmental.  While I am still hopeful for a scientific solution to global warming, fresh water shortages, overfishing, and other adverse affects human short-sightedness has on sustainability, at some point or another I feel like the world's going to need to get its shit together and make hard decisions, as a whole, and that this will never happen as long as individual countries are unwilling to make sacrifices.

I've read a lot of science fiction, a lot of history, a lot of politics and economics and sociology.  I know the dystopian nightmare this concept evokes in many people.  My ideal world is probably impossible, but I don't believe progress is made by ONLY striving for perfection, but both striving for perfection AND accepting half-measures and compromises along the way.

I know I'm not the only person who thinks themselves a citizen of the earth first and foremost.  Who cares about ALL humanity, rather than just those in his backyard.  And I think people who feel that way can and should be given the authority to make decisions that affect the world.

Not that those who care more about their region don't have a place too.  Each region SHOULD have representatives that work for their own people's best interest, makes sure they're not lost among the crowd, taken advantage of, that their voices are heard.

I could go on for pages and pages of details on how I envision this working to maximize fairness and justice and minimize corruption and favoritism, but I'll leave it as it is for now and let the comments bring that stuff out if needed.

Now then, how all this would come about is a completely different matter than all that. Personally I think the most likely answer is alien invasion, but until then, the how this might occur isn't as important to me as whether or not it should in the first place.

**TL;DR**: I believe the future of the planet and humanity would be best served by a single governing body that has ultimate say over matters between countries or that affect the world as a whole, and that even with the potential negatives, the goods outweigh the bads.

So. CMV, please and thank you.

**Edit:** Thanks for some of the great replies. To clear up a point of confusion, individual countries would still exist. Think of the governments as City &lt; State &lt; Country &lt; Global if that helps. The only things that matter to the global government are issues that affect more than one country.  So there can still be healthy competition and localized representation/laws and all that good stuff, but if two countries have a dispute about resources, or one country is messing with the ecosystem, the global government is the final arbiter.

**Edit 2:** To further clarify and expand on an example of checks and balances, this global government would not not have control of the military power.  They are tasked with the administration and logistics of the military to ensure it is truly multicultural and bring it under one chain of command, but no one in this global government could initiate a deployment of the military without the votes of the world's governments to do so.

1368576019.0,112,self.changemyview,1eclii,"I believe that, in the US, there is an ""education bubble"" that will burst within fifteen years, CMV",desantoos,136,24,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eclii/i_believe_that_in_the_us_there_is_an_education/,"Note: See updates below for more recent information.

Background:

I am a graduate student who could become a professor, but I am so sure that the university system will decline that I am considering the ""safer"" route of taking an industry path. I was thinking about this today and I feel like I am more confident about it than I should be. What a better way to test it than here?

Main reasoning:

Domestic applications have been declining over the past few years. I see this trend continuing, if not accelerating, into the future due to the high cost of education and the diminishing capabilities to get loans at reasonable interest rates.

To offset this trend, universities have already begun looking overseas for more students. Let's look at Purdue for example. [This report](http://www.iss.purdue.edu/resources/Docs/Reports/ISS_StatisticalReportFall12.pdf) highlights the near doubling of international students. A large majority of them are from China. You will find that this trend is consistent with a majority of other universities in the US ([here's one example](http://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/students/current/enrollment_data)). This growth is unsustainable for two reasons:

1. China's One Child policy will leave a deficit of available young people in the upcoming years who could enroll in a university in the US.

2. The university programs in China are very likely to take off and be competitive with second-tier universities. [Note: I am defining ""second tier"" as schools with a USA Today rank of roughly 15-100] The investment China has put into research is particularly good and will likely allow them to gain ground on the US education system.

For these reasons, I don't believe the high enrollment at US universities is sustainable and therefore it must be true that soon a good number of these universities, including well-known ones that have high academic rankings, will be in sufficient financial trouble that they will have to fold.

Other reasons:

Research funding has dropped in the US over the past five years. Recent budget cut plans allow for a very reasonable argument that future funding will be slashed even further. Much of this funding goes straight to the university. Thus, this is a revenue source that could hurt and is unlikely to aid if enrollment is down significantly.

Philanthropy is [barely up](http://chronicle.com/article/Charitable-Donations-Barely/132375/) despite a large economic recovery of the rich. It seems very unlikely that future philanthropy will overcome deficits, especially when you consider the increasing percentage of graduates who are international students. There are signs already of desperation, as [Florida State](http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/billionaires-role-in-hiring-decisions-at-florida-state-university-raises/1168680) recently allowed the Koch brothers to have full curriculum control over their economics department in exchange for money.

Salaries for university presidents are up 3% this year, a consistent increase year after year. I believe this expense signifies the increasing cost of administration.

Overall, I believe that with higher interest rates, more difficulty in securing student loans, and less success in the job market, there will be a continued decline in domestic enrollment. This decline cannot be adequately offset by international students: the demand will not be there in the future. Because of lowered enrollments and funding cuts from the government as well as no change in philanthropic aide, I believe that there will be an education bubble wherein many schools, including second-tier schools, will fold or cease to exist due to financial problems. Change my view.

UPDATE: Several people are bringing up the rise of India. It appears that I might be wrong on my perception of the rise of India... I will do some research on this subject before responding to that line of arguments.

FOLLOW-UP: Okay, so from what I see I am wrong that there will not be a growing middle-class in India (I had assumed more of a dichotomy due to India having a high rich-poor gap). Thus, my first point is undermined.

That said, I think some of the other discussion has brought up a greater point: online classes. It makes sense to me that big-name universities--MIT in particular--will steal even more of the students that would normally go to a second-tier undergraduate program. Overall, then I still think there will be a decrease in enrollment at most second-tier programs. So, my view hasn't changed... but the reasons behind it have changed quite a bit.

CMV",aaqucnaona,136,23,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1k9n9d/i_think_nationalism_is_just_as_bad_and_arbitrary/,"We have always been a tribal species. Our recent development of villages, towns and cities has done little to change us under the surface. The pull of in-group/out-group mentality is still prominent. And this has always been the prime psychological basis for all forms of Bigotry. Race and sex [along with ethnicity and religion] are the least tolerated forms of it. However, no-one seems to mind the idea that its OK to fuck over or even kill other humans who are sometimes similar to us in all aspects except being born or living in a different part of the world.

However, its not just the similarity between nationalism and accepted forms of bigotry that drive my view. Its also the belief that for the first time in history, we are becoming one global community. With more than half the human population now on the internet, news and culture from all parts of the globe are events in our daily lives. Moreover, with the space age came many iconic pictures like The Blue Marble, Earthrise and The Pale Blue Dot. The recent videos from the ISS available throughout social media also help re-enforce the idea of a planet fragile and precious, on which human presence is barely discernible  and national boundaries all but invisible. With the new atheist movement and its significant impact on the youth, even religion, arguably one of the most tenacious and potent sources of differentiation among peoples, is losing that ability. The perspective can perhaps be best described [as linked](http://zenpencils.com/comic/100-carl-sagan-pale-blue-dot/).

But its not just an idealistic desire for unity or happiness that underlies my dislike for nationalism. Instead, its a far more pragmatic drive for survival and a desire for sustainable peace. In recent times, we have acquired the means to destroy massive portions of our population, [and maybe even, through nuclear warfare, severely damage the entire biosphere]. Removing ourselves from nationalistic perspectives can go a long way in reducing the desire or willingness for war. While nations may still be a political necessity [for the time being atleast - I hope at some point in the future that the planet can unite under an EarthGov - perhaps a stronger, more powerful successor to the UN or an interdependent coalition of continental governments], nationalism [and patriotism] are ,IMO, not. And as far the love of a particular culture goes, there is no reason why it has to be tied to the love a particular national unit as well. I myself am an Anglophile but don't care much at all for the UK [or England] any more than any other nation/country. 

However, its quite possible that I may be wrong or naive about something in this matter, and if so, I would like to remove any errors in my world-view.

**Summary:** Digital Piracy is stealing.  Stealing is wrong. With our digital marketplace booming with free videos, music, games, and other assorted entertainment/tools, there is no excuse to pirate.

**Common Arguments That Failed to CMV:**

&gt; I'm poor and want free stuff. 

* I struggle and still manage to pay for the things I need, as well as budget for entertainment items I desire.  I would like to own a fancy car for free...I would like a high-end gaming PC for free.  However, this is not how our economy and our society work.  You need to pay for goods.

&gt;Huge corporate media companies make gazillions of dollars.  I'm fighting against their monoploy.

* No, you aren't.  This is a silly form of slacktivism with a healthy dose of self-aggrandizing delusion.  Hitting ""LIKE"" on Facebook does not make you an activist.  Clicking ""Download"" on uTorrent does not make you a corporate buster.

&gt;Digital goods require no cost to duplicate, and thus digital piracy does not affect their business.

* Following traditional Brick and Mortar business models, this would be correct.  However, the shift to a digital production model and ""intangible goods"" does NOT remove the moral contract and obligation to pay for a product you wish to use and enjoy.  Entire businesses are created on the idea that a product can be freely duplicated...this is not some sort of ""Glitch in the Matrix"" that no one understands.  It is a cost calculated into the budget that has been taken into account, and funds allocated elsewhere to accommodate for the difference.  Also, the idea of ""free duplication"" is not always entirely correct...often times the cost of server space, the time/materials that go into the duplication software, the expertise required to design the product/duplication effort, etc...

...and at the end of the day, it doesn't matter!  You can hem and haw about how your uTorrent download does not affect a company's bottomline...but that doesn't matter!  Someone created a product you want, put a price they want, and put the product online for clients to purchase.  If you want it, buy it.  If you don't want to buy it, tough luck...contact the vendor.  Maybe they'll take pity on you and give you a handout.

...

At the end of the day, I have not heard a solid argument on why Digital Piracy is ok.

1365772805.0,115,self.changemyview,1c7coo,I fully believe that people who are offended are the ones to blame for being offended in nearly all instances. This trait of weakness should not be coddled. CMV,sd1717,163,48,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7coo/i_fully_believe_that_people_who_are_offended_are/,"To go futher and to clarify.  I do think there are rare occurances where people could be offended, as what is being said is purely to instigate, or it is being recommended to do harm to you or a loved one.  However, the majority of the time, people are either speaking their truly believed opinion, or even a fact.

For example, saying ""I think that all children should just be killed because they annoy me"" is flame bait, and includes an action that cannot be carried out, or would directly hurt many if it was.....it is born of an unrealistic premise and is obviously meant only to get a reaction.

Another example however; ""I think that you're fat, and the mere site of you makes me dislike you. Your fatness makes me think you are lazy.""  (btw, I'm chubby, this is just an example) This is a feasible statement.  Offensive in today's times?  Of course, to the point that if uttered aloud the person could lose friends....ones who aren't fat. However, the statement on it's own is not untrue, it's a personal belief.

Another ""Black people in America disproportionately commit crimes."" This is actually a statistical fact, and uttering that IRL can cause you to lose friends, and at the very least offend a few black people.  The reason this offends?  I feel it's because it's true and a whole host of other assumptions are made about you based on pointing out something that is true, but unpleasant.  

Today, I've witnessed people state things of this nature about a host of subjects, from race, to politics, to the place of women in society (SRS v. MR), to the store down the street.  And I've witnessed people get terrribly upset and pull the ""You sir have offended ME!"" card, basically labeling the person as a xenophobe and chastizing them.  

All of this has made it truly impossible to have a real conversation on anything, or for us as a society to fix anything since this is at it's worst at the highest levels of the American government (may be this way elsewhere as well, but I am not immersed in those cultures).

My view is that people who get offended/mad/emotional often are the people with the problem, not the person who offends them.  That people should not try to control what others think or say, and should focus on themselves and controling their own emotions.  If you truly disagree with someone or something, engage it and disagree with it on the merits of the claim.  Claiming ""OFFENDED!!"" does not discredit.


edit: to clarify, some words fall under the ""obviously meant only to get a reaction"" or ""what is being said is purely to instigate"".  Some examples were given later in the thread, this is not my point I'm trying to make.  

Examples of what I mean would be the one showed above on race.  For the gay issue, if someone flat out says that they believe homosexuality is wrong.  How about the recent gun issue, the gun rights crowd saying your spitting on the 2nd amendment, the regulation crowd saying your spitting on the graves of the dead Sandy Hook kids, both sides indignant.  Because of this ""I cry offended"" behavior I have yet to hear a single honest debate on race, sexuality, feminism, mens rights in the public sector that didn't devolve into a battle of who's the biggest victim.  This is because we coddle those who are offended, instead of shun them for their changing of the subject, often times when their oposition has a point.  We do the same in our personal lives and discussions amongst groups of freinds and with our significant others.  I'm not saying that some sensitivity is a bad thing, but in a discussion, we should leave that at the door.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1365792597.0,,,True,t3_1c7coo,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c7coo/i_fully_believe_that_people_who_are_offended_are/,

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/sports/comments/1ia00m/tyson_gay_reportedly_caught_doping_pulls_out_of/cb2jh0q) post that made bestof today explains how and why doping is entrenched in the world of modern sports, and that got me thinking.

Why are we opposed to the use of performance-enhancing drugs (PED)? We are apparently okay with finely tuned nutrition and training facilities - so it's not a case of ""fairness"". We will rarely see athletes from poor/undeveloped countries win in these events, even if no one used PEDs. 

The athletes are all humans, and they are using the best-known techniques to push human physical achievement to the limits possible. What exactly is wrong with that? Why is a protein-shake okay, but a PED is not?

In other words, I have come around to the point of view, that the way to level the playing field is to lay off the ""outrage"" and accept it and regulate it. This will make it safer for athletes and more meaningful for actual, above-the-ground research into pushing human achievement.

I think deleting the thread is a bad idea, since good discussion can still arise. Yet, i think banning OPs who abandon threads will help to encourage posters to stick around for the discussion, even if the OPs view remains unchanged.

I think the options could be:

* Giving the OP 24 hours to return to a thread. If they don't return in 24 hours:

* Ban them, or:

* Give them a tag that says something like ""thread abandoner,"" which will go away if they return to the original thread to either engage in discussion or reward deltas.

I see this as a good way to differentiate this sub from /r/politicaldiscussion, as many controversial threads are made over there, yet OPs never get reprimanded for abandoning threads.

One ""peaceful"" protest and one not so peaceful.

- 1. ""Occupy Wall Street""

I have heard the main reason this protest capsized was that there was no real spearhead. It became a parody of itself, that being a bunch of unemployed hipsters with nothing better to do with their day causing a slight ruckus. It gained global coverage, it gained a massive following, and even with no true leader, on paper it seemed like a strong movement. Sadly, this seemed to do nothing, in fact, worse than nothing. Not only did nothing get done about their ""1%"" but they are now a laughing stock.

 -  2. Student Fee Protests  

In England, there were protests pretty much everywhere assembled by students to stop the rise in fee's. The thing that made it so popular was an act of Vandalism on Tory HQ, including the ""Boy who threw a Fire Extinguisher of the Roof"". This protest turned into a riot and suddenly people began to take notice. There were more acts, more riots, and this produced more coverage. The protesters, however, began siding with the media and all of these acts were discouraged and shunned quite actively. When the vote was cast in favour of the fee rises, it ended with a whimper of ""Shame on you"" chants, then forgotten about a day later.

Now, with David Cameron banning of Porn on the public and him once again obeying the wishes of Mumsnet, we passively shrug our shoulders, type our angry paragraphs and get on with our lives without doing much about it, and allow it when papers call this a ""victory"".

CMV.,Chronopolitan,129,23,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gfbcl/as_an_expansion_of_the_sex_censorship_for/,"From a very young age I was allowed to watch X-Files, South Park, countless R-rated movies, violent action shows/films, I had (albeit accidental) access to Playboy magazines and even pornographic magazines--in short, I was exposed to everything the average adult is exposed to on a regular basis; and, thanks to my internet prowess and the general freedom allowed to me, plenty of things even the average adult doesn't encounter.

I don't understand why we assume that children somehow ""can't handle things."" When my dad saw me watching South Park, he sat me down and explained to me that it was a comedy show, that jokes are not necessarily meant seriously, and so on. When I saw some grisly action film or slasher flick, it was explained exactly what was real and what was not, and I was taught how to separate the two. I played games like Doom, Unreal Tournament, System Shock 2, Grand Theft Auto 3/VC/SA, pretty much every violent game there was--starting as early as I can remember, perhaps 4 years old or sooner.

I never, ever confused the content of the games for reality, I never confused the content of South Park or Terminator or whatever the hell for reality. I've never been in a fight, never been violent towards anyone, always felt that violence *in reality* was very much wrong while violence in virtuality was totally irrelevant to reality. I was taught to understand the separation between the two things.

I am of the mind that the consciousness of a child is fully equipped to handle whatever content is thrown at it, if the content is properly framed and explained. I don't see why we should edit any aspect of reality 'for the children.' I don't see why kids can't handle free exploration of 'forbidden knowledge' or why anything at all should BE forbidden.

Note: Any arguments that these things should be censored for the sake of ensuring children 'fit in' or don't 'offend people' will fall on deaf ears. Circular logic is useless to me, and if the only justification for (as was commonly referenced in the sex-censorship thread) such censorship is ""kids will behave in ways that violate the social taboo in question,"" then I am all the more confident I am correct.

Note2: I'm also not suggesting we go out of our way to expose every odd thing to a child, my point is more like, if a child, say encounters the acronym BDSM, and is curious what that is, and goes off to figure it out, that they can handle the discovery and exposure to such content if it is properly framed/explained by a parent.

A breakdown:

Like if someone got offended, I would say ""Oh, get over yourself, you know I'm not really being racist."" I even felt like sort of an authority on the issue because I was on the receiving end of a lot of it.

As I've gotten older, I've come to realize that it's not about perception of you, but about saying emotionally-harmful shit to people who are exceptionally vulnerable to that very shit. 

There's a certain stigma attached to certain words because of the way they're used, either now or in the past, and for good reason. There's also a certain stigma attached to even having this discussion, for worse reason. But the fact of the matter is that when nearly an entire demographic find a word offensive, using it in spite of that just makes you look like an asshole, and actually can hurt people. 

Propagation of that attitude certainly does, which is why when you're not in mixed company it's still probably a bad idea. Sure, knowing your audience might enable that kind of thing, but that's a risky enough concern to address that I just abstain from doing it.

* It has a non-human arbiter, think a constitution in computer form so it does not need to be ""interpreted"" but can explain itself and its original intent.

* it has an objective metric for human intelligence, or capacity for competence, if competence is shown not to be casually related to intelligence.

* the arbiter ranks people based on their metric. 

* The highest ranked use the Scientific Method to solve social and economic problems by testing different ideas in different ""sub groups"" such as states or provinces.

I have always been an atheist.  Neither of my parents were religious but the concept of religion was never brought up during by childhood unless i had questions.  My extended family are all religious and I was brought to church all the time and spent a lot of time around religion and religious people, so my ideas on religion weren't created in a vacuum, but my parents were intent on letting me discover spiritualism or lack of it completely on my own, so i have no grasp of what it is like to grow up in an environment where a certain point of view was expected.

That being said, I quickly became very critical of religion and religious people.  Perhaps it's because I grew up in the deep south and was surrounded by a lot of negative spiritualism and fundamentalist fanaticism, but as my ideas on the subject grew i became more and more disillusioned to the idea that religion has any valuable purpose in human society.

Recently, my attitude towards religion and religious people has softened quite a bit, and I am less critical of the followers of religion than i am of the institution as a whole, and i've come to terms with why religion is such a widespread human concept and why the vast majority of people were and are religious.

Hello everyone coming in from /r/bestof! [Thanks to this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1ikcbj/fedworkerthrowaway_describes_how_crushing_working/) we're getting a huge spike in activity.

Since there are a lot of new members coming in, I would also like to remind people to please **read the sidebar!** Also, [check out our Wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/index) We've put **a lot** of work into it, and there is a lot of information about this subreddit that can be found there!

As some of you will notice, the submissions have been temporarily restricted. This is done so all newcomers will have time to read the rules before submitting. We will lift the restriction soon, but please stay tuned.  

**DeltaBot may crash from having to award so many.** If your delta does NOT get counted, please wait before messaging us because we know there may be problems!

---  

While I have your attention, I also want to clarify one thing that has bothered a few users for awhile. To a few who come in, this subreddit may not seem very welcoming. Why? The various controversial opinion threads (you know the ones!) that are posted usually get a ton of comments plus a lot of upvotes, so to some it might make it seem like this subreddit's users all believe that.  

There are a few things I want to mention:  

1) **OP's view does not represent that of the community.** Controversial threads simply get more attention because people are passionate about their views towards them. About half the comments will support OP (especially if OP's views fall in line with mainstream Reddit), but you can be assured that the other half represent the minority view (we WILL enforce comment rule 1). There are no circlejerks to be found here! Don't take the thread title at its face value! Try and challenge OP's view. We enforce rule 1 to ensure that the minority view has a fighting chance! 

2) **Is OP really being open-minded? Is this some kind of brigade?** We used to have an old rule called rule VIII that disallowed people to use this subreddit as a soapbox. Well, we got rid of that rule because we felt that **it should be implicit in the ethos of this sub and will be enforced as such**. If you believe someone is here NOT in good faith, either through their comments or history, then **message the moderators.** Getting into needless slapfights only wastes your own time.  

3) **Why do we allow controversial opinions like XXXX?** You either allow them and take them on a case-by-case basis, or ban them. While it's true that on really heated topics people are less likely to have their view changed, *it does happen.* I've personally seen deltas awarded in many of these threads, even if they're not from OP. These threads are also the most popular by far (whether or not the activity is legitimate, ie. could be due to brigading, is up to debate but I believe it's legitimate) so taking away these discussions would hurt the subreddit. *I'm sorry if seeing these discussions puts you off!* Really, I'm not a big fan of them myself either. If you want to see posts that interest you, *try making one yourself!* Also, upvote and participate in threads that interest you! [Yesterday's Disney villian thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ihnzp/i_believe_maleficent_from_sleeping_beauty_is_the/) was an unexpected success, for example.

4) **So what kind of threads do we remove?** Obvious troll posts like ""I think the Holocaust was bad CMV."" which, due to rule 1, would force users to argue that the Holocaust was *good*. See where I'm going? We also will remove threads when it becomes clear that OP is not appearing open-minded, or if OP is consistently rude to users in their own thread.  

5) **Think about what the alternative would be!** Controversial opinions that you might see on /r/askreddit's ~~weekly~~ daily thread may get posted here, but **because of rule 1, at least the comments challenge that opinion!** What *if* the opposite view were posted? Ex. ""I don't think the Roma are as bad as Reddit makes them out to be, CMV."" You can imagine what the responses would be like, right?  

I hope the above clarifies our position on these kinds of threads. I also hope people can point others to this thread when they are confused or frustrated by this sub's content.

What would the protesters have ""us"" do?  If anything, the state was overzealous in its prosecution of Zimmerman (i.e., charging second degree murder) and a JURY found him not guilty?  

If anything, the government's overreach indicates the exact opposite of what the protesters are claiming - that society won't go after white people who kill black people.  Instead, it is evidence the government will go too far in prosecuting these crimes because of the intense political pressure brought to bear.

Anyway, I don't think these protesters have any specific grievance that they can actually point to; it is just a hodge podge of generalized self-characterization as victims.

Why should people seeking education be subsidizing an athletic team especially when the cost of education is ballooning?

Athletic programs sap resources from schools that could go towards improving education, giving more financial assistance to students that need it, etc.

Many college athletes who otherwise wouldn't have any hope of qualifying for a school get in because they're good at a game.  School acceptance should be an issue of academic merit.  The slot of an unqualified athlete would be better given to someone more deserving academically.

Athletes are generally held to lower standards or given leniency academically, making a joke out of their degree, releasing unqualified graduates, and diluting the academic reputation of schools.  Everyone should be on an even playing field (huge pun).

I **do** think there is a place for athletics at schools, but only as 'hobby' undertaken by otherwise qualified students.  If they get it on academic merit like everyone else and decide to play sports while keeping up with their studies, that is ok.  This alone would make programs much cheaper and less of a drain on school resources, but I think programs should also have to be self-financing, which would mean huge cuts in expenditure for almost all programs.

**Edit: Sources on cost**

&gt;Just 23 of 228 athletics departments at NCAA Division I public schools generated enough money on their own to cover their expenses in 2012. Of that group, 16 also received some type of subsidy — and 10 of those 16 athletics departments received more subsidy money in 2012 than they did in 2011. 
http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/2013/05/07/ncaa-finances-subsidies/2142443/

&gt;Only seven other athletics programs at public universities broke even or had net operating income on athletics each year from 2005-2009, according to data provided by USA Today to the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics (for which I consult).] http://www.acenet.edu/news-room/Pages/Myth-College-Sports-Are-a-Cash-Cow2.aspx

&gt;The median expense per student athlete in 2009 was $76,000.

&gt;Average assistance that each university gave to the athletic department was $10.2 million

&gt;A recent NCAA report stated that only 14 of the 120 athletic programs in the Football Bowl Subdivision made money.

The thread was ""Overly attached Reddit: ""Honestly, if she was overly attached to me I would not mind. Dat body."" [+250].""

I replied to the thread with, ""I don't know if this one is necessarily sexist because a woman could say this about a man.

---
CMV is the closest thing that Reddit has to a general discussion subreddit in which topics do not start with questions, and because of that, some people twist it to try to turn it into a general discussion subreddit. Others (okay, I, but I doubt I am alone) often avoid posting potentially interesting discussions, not because of close-mindedness, but because discussing something can be more productive/fun than constantly being pressured to change a view. *This creates an opening for a new general discussion subreddit, which I believe could benefit this subreddit and its users.*

Please note that I am not arguing against the purpose of CMV here. It is one of the best subreddits currently on Reddit, but its scope is limited. A general discussion subreddit would be a supplement, not a replacement.

---
**Further explanation:**
---
There is currently no discussion-based subreddit, other than /r/changemyview, that starts with statements rather than questions. This subreddit gained a lot of traction thanks in part to its strong central concept (go here to change your mind) and good execution (get super-upvotes for changing minds).

**Problem #1:**

Because /r/changemyview is the only subreddit of its kind, people have flocked to it as a soapbox of sorts. Some circlejerk common views, others present interesting opinions but have no clear intention of changing them. Here are some examples from the past week:

*More popular:*

There are many more than these, but you get the idea. It's not a massive problem in my eyes, because the assertions made by OPs often generate interesting discussion. However, they remain in opposition to the express purpose of the subreddit: 
&gt; CMV is not a place to preach to the masses.

&gt; We consider this to be an implicit rule of this subreddit. If you are specifically here to argue for a certain viewpoint and do not participate regularly in other threads, then this is not the subreddit for you. No one who comments here should be doing so to ""champion their cause."" Users who do so may be banned, as allowing this behavior goes against the ethos of this subreddit.

In short, this subreddit is /r/changemyview, not /r/challengemyview, and people are often reluctant to make that distinction. I believe that this is, in part, because *there is no other place on Reddit to post your viewpoint and inspire discussion.*

**Problem #2:** 

Because of Rule #1, the odds are against OP from the beginning. They post their views, and every direct response that stays within the rules will be a criticism of those views. People do not come to CMV threads, in my experience, to consider OP's view and have their minds changed. They come to change OP's mind, and OP is often left stranded in a sea of hostiles (with occasional support from a few others). OPs don't get deltas, they don't get to change views, and there is an air of resentment if they do not change their own views. They spawn interesting discussion, but it is not discussion about their ideas. It is discussion about criticisms of their ideas--good for users as a whole, but not so good for OPs. It works well in this subreddit, because the express point is to change OP's view, and Rule #1 is a unique aid to that. However, it means that a lot of good, discussion-inspiring posts have no home on Reddit.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1chlts/i_do_not_plan_on_voting_cmv/) is an example of what I'm talking about. It was my first post in this subreddit, and it didn't do too badly. I wrote it as a ChallengeMyView, though, not as a ChangeMyView, and it may have been better suited still to DiscussMyView or something. I have refrained from posting similar topics since--things that I think could lead to interesting discussion--because they do not fit in the scope of this subreddit. It's frustrating, though, because I see value in posting them, and in seeing others post that sort of thing, but, again, there is no active subreddit with that intent.

**Conclusion:**

/r/changemyview is the closest thing we have to a general-discussion subreddit. For many discussions, posters are limited to single-issue subreddits (ex: /r/libertarian, /r/theoryofreddit), which are limited in scope and rarely offer a broad range of responses, since most people in those places hold the same sets of assumptions. This strikes me as a glaring hole in Reddit, and one that holds direct interest to users of /r/changemyview. 

I would love to see a subreddit where people made posts similar to those in /r/changemyview (thoughtful assertions of positions or presentations of ideas), with the responses serving primarily to further discussion on that topic rather than to contradict the original posters. It would certainly be more prone to groupthink and one-sided discussions than /r/changemyview, but I expect that interesting, thought-provoking things would come out of it despite that. Ideally it would be a cross between /r/depthhub and /r/changemyview.

---
**Possible solutions:**
---
1. Resurrect an existing, dead subreddit. The best choice I've found is /r/letstalkabout, which already seeks to fill this niche. It is, unfortunately, very, very dead.

2. Start a new subreddit (a few possibilities that I see: /r/challengemyview, /r/letstalkaboutthis, /r/conversationhub).

3. Accept posts of that type into /r/changemyview.

4. Do nothing (perhaps because already existing subreddits are good enough, due to low demand, or for some other reason)

The third solution seems inadequate, since that would dilute the purpose of /r/changemyview far beyond its initial intent. I find the fourth to be inadequate also, for reasons already outlined.

The first and second are both interesting--the first could end up problematic because existing moderators could oppose or hinder this type of thing, the second because starting a subreddit is no small task and I have no experience there. I consider them both valid options, though.

**My questions for /r/changemyview:**
---
1. Do you agree with the limitations of /r/changemyview as I have stated them? Do you consider them to be good limitations?

2. Is there sufficient reason to start a new subreddit? 

3. If there is reason to start a new subreddit, are you interested in one with the intent I described?

I am a classically educated pianist and I enjoy a large variety of music (classic rock, classical music, folk rock and many other genres). However, I cannot help but feel that rap and hip-hop are simply terrible in terms of musical quality.  When I hear a song from either of these genres, it typically seems excessively repetitive (often comprising of a short beat with little tonal variation repeated on a loop throughout the song), largely unoriginal (many songs are very stylistically similar), and require little skill or talent to actually produced (any idiot with a computer and a pattern in his head can loop a short track over and over and call it a song).  I recognize that there are many songs in any genre that are unoriginal, repetitive, and of general low quality, but it seems to me that the vast, vast majority of rap and hip-hop songs are qualitatively bad.

Also, please note that I am talking about the instrumental parts of songs, NOT the lyrics.  I think that many rappers are brilliant lyricists, but they are simply talking in rhythm to a repetitive track in the background.

1372914495.0,103,self.changemyview,1hm7uw,I believe Utilitarianism is the only valid system of morals. CMV.,Wulibo,146,43,316,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hm7uw/i_believe_utilitarianism_is_the_only_valid_system/,"Utilitarianism is the belief that the most moral action is the one that maximizes total happiness for the collective. It believes that happiness for one person is equal to the same amount of happiness for another person, with absolutely no variables.

An example of this is that many people I know believe that once someone commits an indictable crime, they forfeit their absolute personhood, and their utility becomes less valuable than another's, to use Utilitarian terminology (or more plainly, they don't matter as much as contributing members of society). However, for a Utilitarian, it is just as important to minimize a criminal's suffering as it is to ensure the safety of society as a whole on the same scale.

I understand where people are coming from when they say that good people need to be treated better and protected because that incentivizes good, or because good people *deserve* it more. I agree with both of these statements, to a degree. However, at face value, I think ""deserving"" is an invalid concept, and actions should be carried out to the maximum total benefit, rather than to shift benefit to those who should have it. I also see the entire purpose of law itself to be to steer society towards good, and therefore it is morally good to do things that will make people want to be on the right side of the law, but the end of benefiting good people more than bad is a means to the end of shifting those bad people to good more than it is an end in and of itself.

Not only do I believe that this is the *correct* moral philosophy, I believe that any system of morality which rejects the core utilitarian belief that maximum total happiness (utility) is the only valid end is inherently evil and misguided, and should be eliminated. The argument that people have the right to certain views or such don't make sense to me, because a utilitarian world is better than a non-utilitarian one.

In a realistic, day-to-day sense, I behave like any one of you. I speak up for equal rights, I won't do anything drastic, and I simply attempt to reciprocate kindness and consider that ""enough."" However, the core arche that lays in the centre of all of my thought is and always has been that my actions are ideally to the end of maximum happiness for the most involved parties. This does not mean I attempt to shift my thought patterns to that of an Archangel (R. M. Hare's concept of a being who knows every outcome of every action and can act to create maximum utility), but rather that when I try to ""do the right thing,"" or construct, ponder, or debate my philosophical and political beliefs, it is always in the consideration of what will create the most total utility.

I've already read up on all the criticisms, and I see most ""undesirable"" outcomes as positive (a utility monster would be supremely happy and create no suffering, murder is acceptable to stop a trolley, the mona lisa is more valuable than the old lady in the fire, etc). What I ask is for you to show me ways that other systems of belief are not totally evil and in some way bigoted, in that they detract from total happiness to some personal or hopelessly selfless end.

&gt;Quite simply, [person X] will have to accept what the rest of the country will have to accept—there has been an unofficial Congressional Black Caucus for over 200 years, and now it's our turn to say who can join 'the club.' He does not, and cannot, meet the membership criteria, unless he can change his skin color. Primarily, we are concerned with the needs and concerns of the white population, and we will not allow black America to infringe on those objectives.

Sounds pretty horribly racist, like something Robert Byrd would say back in the 70's. It's actually a [direct quote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus#Non-Black_Membership) from House Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr. in 2007 only I flipped the words black and white. It's in regards to a white representative who wanted to join the Black Caucus because 60% of his constituency is black.

The Congressional Black Caucus is a shameful embarrassment because it openly promotes racism. That quote isn't some out of context word grab. It's an *issued statement*. Race relations get talked about a decent amount in America and it looks pretty horrible when our highest tier of government is openly racist.

Yet I never really hear anyone complain about the group's existence, so is there something I'm just not getting? CMV.

EDIT: regarding my use of the word ""racism"", I having been going on Merriam-Webster definition #2, which states it as:

&gt;[preconceived judgement or opinion](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prejudice)

and ""discrimination"" meaning

1) You are endangering your child which is what child abuse is all about.

There is a disease that you can prevent your child from getting and rather than do that you are letting your personal beliefs (which are entirely unfounded by science) dictate their possibly contracting a deadly disease.

2) It isn't just about your children.

When you don't get your child vaccinated it prevents the disease from ever getting wiped out. Your children become carriers which means the disease gets pulled into the next generation and continually worsens.

Instead of a bad disease that gets wiped out, we have a bad disease which continually evolves and gets stronger thanks you parents to don't do the responsible thing.

This endangers society as a whole which is outside of your ""rights"" as a parent.

I live in the US if that helps.

Everywhere I turn I see people complaining about how much racism is such an issue these days. Most of the time the people saying this (in my experience) are hypocrites and usually don't make any effort to change what they're complaining about. I watch them talk about how they are oppressed and slandered by other races, yet they turn right around and do exactly that to other people. I don't necessarily think it's so much even White people being racist these days. Obviously, there are still racist White people, but in my experience it's evenly distributed between all races.

When I was a kid I never hated anyone. It didn't matter what race they were or how they looked; they were just like anyone else. I played with them and talked to them and they were exactly like me. 

Of course, I started to grow up and hear things. My family talked about how everyone in their workplace of so-and-so race acted this way or did that thing or had that attitude. I was fed these pieces of hatred and rolled them over in my still-young mind. It made sense to me. I took these biases and used them. I used them to hurt and degrade other humans at a young age. I didn't know the effects of my words. 

After I had grown more I thought again about these things. Why? Why do I feel this way about this entire group of people? Where did I pick this up? I never used to hate these people, so why did I suddenly start to? This is how I came to my realization. I only picked these biases up from things I had heard, rather than by my own judgment. Only recently have I torn away from these feelings and this is the first thing that I noticed about this subject.

I disagree with this whole premise, I believe that the trend of social progressivism that occurred during the 20th century was a by-product of improving standards of living during that time, and not wholly a deliberate effort on the part of the masses. While there were definitely people pushing the civil rights movement for women, blacks, gays and the rest it seems to me that the reason these have caught on is less to do with people becoming more educated in the relevant fields and more to do with the standard of living improving for people enough that they simply occupy themselves with something else and don't bother exerting energy to follow these political trends, opting to just roll with it.

The reason I feel this way is because I see a direct link between poverty and discrimination. We can of course account for different cultures like those of Islamic countries, but even in westernized regions there appears to be a clear relationship between the two. The most conservative parts of the United States are those with the highest poverty levels (the bible belt), the most socially liberal parts of the EU are those with the best safety nets for the population. Furthermore, due to the economic crisis it appears that the trend is reversing, with attitudes to immigration worsening and some countries outright acquiring Neo-Nazi movements.  

If this is the case, can it really be said that the civil rights movement is an inherent part of western society, or is social progressivism just another aquired luxury of first-world living?

**TL;DR: I believe the social liberal trend in the west isn't so much an ideology in itself but the absence of any conservative counter-ideology, with people becoming accepting of gays and the like because of material comfort-induced indifference rather than an informed conviction. Ergo, I believe that if the average standards of living in the west deteriorate things may very well go backwards on the civil rights front.**

It will probably be a mess between religious peoples and people who want western economics so oppression of women and liberal thinkers will likely be policy.

I'm sick and tired of hearing ""oh, those aren't *real* feminists"" whenever feminists are caught doing something hateful (and in this case illegal).

I've come to believe that at best, feminism is only-pro-women and at worst, feminism is anti-man.

The best argument I've ever heard was along the lines of 'helping women helps men too' which just sounds like a con straight out of Animal Farm.

Abortion and Birth Control are completely one-sided.  It has nothing to do with being equal to men.  

And complaining about how girl gamers are treated, how women are objectified in the media, Slut Shaming, and a lack of representation for women in politics just shows a gross lack of understanding about any of these subjects.

All gamers treat all other gamers terribly (regardless of gender), EVERYONE is objectified in the media (regardless of gender), men are both slut shamed (it's called player shaming) AND virgin shamed, and women are represented in politics as more women vote than men and that's just how democracy works.

I mean, feminism definitely had a place 30 and 40 years ago but, in the US at least, it's really run its course.  There's nothing valid left to fight for.

And Reddit has really soured me on the whole thing because all the feminist subreddits (from /r/shitredditsays to /r/feminism to /r/feminisms ) have the whole ""agree with us or you get banned"" attitude.

If you are curious how and what, you can read this below.

I honestly believe this, and to clear things up beforehand.

Sexual interest is **NOT** Sexual action. 
Also, I expected this to already be on here, but could not find such a thing.

So here it is:

A man and a women. Can not be friends **unless.**

Atleast one of the 2 has sexual interest in the other. 

OR have been growing up pre-age 3. (Explained below) &lt; **Tiny edit** I learned this age can vary a lot. This was just the scientific study I have seen. ofcourse it can be 4 or 5, and I red(and sounds very logical) it can very well be pre-puberty based.

This even counts for gays, a lot of gay guys if you ask them will still have sex with most of their female friends to ""See what it's like""

The pre-age 3 thing is pretty biological, you get used to the smell, look, touch and attraction of people around that age to protect from incest. Which as you all should now, is a bad thing for nature.

Try and change my view. I want to believe it, but not sure if I can.

**Post-Edit 3** I learned about A-sexual people etc. but what I am interested in is actually: 2 average people, 1 male, 1 female, both heterosexual.

**Edit** Already thanks for all the responces, I got a lot more then I expected I will be reading trough most and hopefully replying to most of them troughout the day(s).

**Edit2** I have red a lot of important things, what I do blieve is that 80% of the responding people miss what a friendship is. User CowboyNinjaD posted a really nice thing that I would like you to read before you assume what a friend is and respond. 

&gt;I think there's generally a lot of confusion with this issue because people don't really know what a ""friend"" is. A friend is someone who you go out of your way to spend time with because you enjoy their company. This seems pretty simple and straight forward, but a lot of people go around slapping the term ""friend"" on people they just sort of like.

&gt;Just because I'm on friendly terms with my female co-workers, that doesn't mean they're my friends. I don't see them outside of work unless it's a work related event. If they no longer worked with me, I'd probably never talk to them again.

&gt;Also, my sisters-in-law aren't my friends. And when they were just dating my brothers, they weren't my friends then either. I like them both. They're both lovely women. But I would never go out of my way to hang out with either one of them alone, unless I was doing them a favor or giving them a ride or something useful. I wouldn't just call them up to hang out. And the same goes for the wives and girlfriends of all my male friends.

&gt;Also, if you're in your late teens or early 20s, you can't really have a good perspective on any of this. In high school and college, everyone is ""friends"" with everyone. It's just a mass of people, drinking, doing drugs and having sex. Of course all these people are going to seem like your friends. Just wait and see how many of these people you're anything more than facebook friends with by the time you're 30.

**Edit 2.1** (This is to get you up to date with my progress)

User irishninjachick is the first one to make a propper hit. and move me closer to CMV 

&gt;I saw an interesting question asked on /r/AskMen that was about male friends masturbating to their female friends. Many guys said how they would masturbate to anything and anyone that popped in their mind at the time. The person didn't need to be ""hot"" or even remotely attractive to them. I know both get curious what-ifs that aren't taken seriously. 

&gt;There's a difference between full on attraction forever and ever and the short-term attraction, whether it is a few confused seconds, a week, a month, or a year. There's been times where I had periods of being attracted to some of my guyfriends who I originally had no attraction what-so-ever to because I was in a lonely phase or trying to grt over someone or just got very hormonal. It happens. But I wouldn't consider that type of attraction the glue of the friendship. 

&gt;Honestly, you could argue there is sexual attraction (no matter the gender and sexuality) in all types of friendships. Human beings have sexual urges that come up. Even if they are small and sometimes unconscious, it is there. But to the degree you are saying, the sexual attraction isnt always such a huge factor for multi-gender friendships. For some, yes. Not all. 

&gt;There's other attracting features in friendships that keeps it lasting. Who says attraction must always be sexual? There are people who have very nice features that make you want to trust them more, be around them, communicate with them. Reproduction might be one of the survival instincts, but it is not the only one. People become friends for other reasons than sexual urges. Social psychology of friendship is much more complicated than you realize. I suggest doing some reading in it; you'll see how ""boys and girls cannot be friends without sexual attraction"" doesn't work.


Another responce from irishninjachick.

If that was the case, I would not have as many guyfriends as I do. My friends who are male like me because we share things in common and have fun hanging out. Just because I happen to be the gender that they are attracted to does not automatically mean that the chemistry of friendship is sexual interest. Guys have different types and interests. What is the glue to our strong friendship is the trust, communication, and loyalty we have for each other. That type of bound is genderless. I know if I need a good rant or some male in sight, I can count on them. I know if I need a night to relax and be myself, I can count on them. They know if they need a rant or advice, they can count on me. Ect ect ect.

It's the Harry Potter Marathons, bomb fires, Yogurtland (frozen yogurt) adventures, the christmas parties, cheering for each other at events, walks by lakes, swinging on the swings, drunken nights at clubs and smoking hookah, midnight donut runs, walking downtown, freezing our butts off in the snow, arguing over marvel vs.dc comics, having success pizza over good grades, debates over books, discussions of plot twisters in tv shows, and freaking out at how awesome batman and the avengers movies were. It's those texts in the morning when you are feeling depressed, the confidence boosts after a rough day at work, the hugs and smiles exchanged after not seeing each other in months, helping them walk when they are too drunk, defending you when your asshole exs comes by, being open eare as they gush about their girlfriends, and the deep converstations about life. 

That is not sexual attraction. It is a bond more powerful. Sexual attraction involves lust. There's no lust in those moments. It's like being in a family that you were born into. Think of your bestfriend, the brotherhood. Just because I have boobs and a vagina does not make my bond with my friends any less than yours. Unless, do you believe that all the hetersexual males that you are friends with onlycontinue being friends with you because they are sexually attracted to you? That's the type of logic you are saying.

Both friends initiate contact. There isnt always a sexual attraction behind it. Sex might be one of the desires. Humans are social beings. We have a motivation for all types of companionship. For some people, they might only see the potential of someone of the opposite gender for sexual intimacy, but not everyone is like that.

A lot of my guyfriends have girlfriends. And you know what? Those girls know me and know I'm not a threat. Their boyfriends are dating them-not me- for a reason. A male is not attracted physically to every single woman on the planet. We all have our fetishes, our likes and dislikes. We all want different types of relationships. To expect that there must always be a sexual interest would be undermining the psychology of a human race. The world is not a massive orgy free-for-all. People are friends because they enjoy each other's company.

Anyone who has been with us for a while now will know we've had plans to improve DeltaBot - some known, some secret. Unfortunately, it appears that the writing process has stopped and we've decided that we need to find someone who will be dedicated to improving the bot, and what better place to search than in the subreddit itself? 

A few basic requirements (other than an interest in improving the experience of CMV) are:

* Programming knowledge - the language reddit bots must be written in is Python. Reddit uses a program called [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html).

* We ask that you do your best to remain easy to contact during the writing process.

* Knowledge of how the delta system works.

If it's clear that you are a good choice as a programmer of DeltaBot, we will discuss ideas shortly. Another thing to note is that if the previous programmer returns interest, it would be wise to attempt a collaboration between the two of you, as he has a lot of experience when it comes to how DeltaBot works.

Please submit a mini application in the comments below. It doesn't have to be thorough - just to clarify you do indeed have the knowledge, interest and enthusiasm to carry out this job.

Regards,

Snorrrlax and the /r/changemyview mod team.

EDIT: It's been suggested that DeltaBot should be an open source for anyone to contribute towards. This is a great idea and no doubt something we will do in the near future, but DeltaBot currently has some major work to be done and a few big ideas that we'd like implemented. In other words, the foundations needs to be laid down correctly before lots of people get involved.

We will have a think about our plan over the next couple of days and contact the programmer(s?) in due time. Thanks for the great responses so far!

- PRISM (NSA program accessing data on the hundreds of millions of users of Facebook, Google, Microsoft services and much more)
- Tempora (British program that splices into fiber optic cables and sifts through *everything* in there, sharing data with the NSA)

**The huge problems I find with them**:

- Potential for abuse: as they are today, these systems do not have **technical limitations** that prevent unauthorized invasions of privacy. In Snowden's words, if an analyst has access to the query system he can pull up data on anything he wants regardless of warrants and regulations.

- Excessively wide access: Snowden reports that between the NSA and GCHQ (British SIGINT), 850.000 people have clearance to access the data. That's way too many. What percentage of dishonest (low morals, corruptible, blackmailable) people will there be? 0.01%? that would still leave 85 people who might (be forced to) pull data on anyone and anything in the world for malicious purposes.

- Lack of credible judicial oversight: PRISM is subject to FISC warrants, however the requirements for them are extremely generic (51% probability of foreign target, no need to specify which assets and facilities will be investigated). Also, FISC rulings are secret and have been shown to have considerably extended the initial scope of the program, all without the possibility for the public to know of it and challenge it in higher courts. For Tempora, we don't even know what kind of judicial oversight exists, if at all.

**What this all means**

It means that the system is incredibly open to abuse. A small group of insiders, with even just one having access to the system, can exploit it to maliciously gather all kinds of information. The purposes are almost unlimited: industrial espionage, insider trading, blackmail, leaking embarassing information political, personal or business competitors...you name it.

Not only that, but even authorized access could be questionable. Right now the legal scope of the system is ""national security"", but there are little safeguards to prevent it from becoming ""maintaining the current administration in power"". Think it's impossible that a President would stoop to such lows? Nixon tried it with considerably less sophisticated means, using ex-secret service operatives.

Think about it - it requires absolutely minimal effort to become a part of, it promotes an apathetic view of the world and takes sloth and idleness to new extremes. You might say it is a peaceful and creative movement, but I argue that in this case it is hard to tell them apart from being simply under the influence and non confrontational. I believe marijuana,  like most low class drugs, in moderation does little harm. However the culture itself promotes the idea that it's completely harmless. So many times I've heard stoners argue you can't get addicted to it, that it's a just a plant man, you can't overdose. Except you can get addicted to it, datura is also just a plant man, and while you can't overdose, you can have still have a very adverse reaction comparable to a bad trip on a high dose of psychedelics.

CMV",Ramdizzy,119,26,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g6yz0/for_rational_thinkers_its_a_waste_of_time_to_talk/,"Let me just define an irrational thinker as someone who ""accepts"" and ignores inconsistencies in his thinking. It makes no sense trying to ""uncover"" these inconsistencies to such a person. I hold this view because of multiple life experiences, when I talked to people believing in homepathy, general esoterics, political conspiracies etc. Even in a friendly environment, when a problem is approached together in a step-by-step manner and facts are presented, irrational thinkers seem to never get the point or the chain of reasoning and are unable to draw logical conclusions - ok otherwise they wouldnt be irrational. But I say they even cant do this with lots of help.
Importantly, these experiences differ completely from talking to a rational thinker, who holds an opposing opinion.

Clarification: After reading all these answers (sorry for the little delay), I think I have to specify what I meant. I dont have a problem at all with people holding opposing opinions. Some of you were very fast to bring r/atheism or common liberal positions into the game. I think the actual opinion has nothing to do with the way of thinking, and the intermingling of anti-religious positions and the rational way of thinking is maybe limited to US-american internet users.
What I meant is the WAY of finding ones opinion. Of couse you were right that everybody needs some axioms. It is the so called ""scientific method"", its principles can be explained very easily and I never met somebody who refuted this method, nobody, not even the most hardcore esoterics, and also no ""I play devils advocate"" intellectual called this methods e.g. a ""belief system"". The reason is: when you try to argue it, you automatically use it.
For the case of esoteric people, they initially LOVE to apply this scientific method to their beliefs. We together go, step by step, through hypothetical experiments (investigating shamans, information storage in water, chakras etc) until a point is reached where a conclusion can be made. When I tell them that e.g. in the case of homeopathy these experiments have already been made a thousand times, and homeopaths regularly fail controlled tests, then .. there is nothing happening. No further ongoing debate, no spark of thought, nothing. Its like their mind switches off at this point. I did these discussions now for 10 years, and came to a point where I question their usefulness.

Conclusion: The best pro-talking argument presented was probably ""Everybody starts as an irrational thinker. Only by talking to eachother, people can change."" A prerequisite for a good discussion is a setting which can be called ""dialectic"", as opposed to a non-productive, ""polemic"" discussion atmosphere. Some of you claimed, that with enough dialectic discussions, cognitive dissonance (a feeling of inner contradiction) can be created that can, not immediately but later, lead to questioning of a position, but if somebody can change his actual way of reasoning is still open.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1371375730.0,,,True,t3_1g6yz0,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g6yz0/for_rational_thinkers_its_a_waste_of_time_to_talk/,

CMV,PWR_OF_LOVE,120,31,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hov9j/the_only_road_to_a_better_world_is_a_drastic/,"School is universally known as one of the most important things we do in our life. In many Western countries it is even mandatory by law.

But how good is this system? What kind of stuff do we learn out children? There are classes which could improve but are 100% necessary. Things like language, basic math. Things which we use in everyday life. I think basic psychology and ''debating, critical thinking, logic classes'' should be on par with language and math - as far as how much needed they actually are. 

But when we look things like history, it is a whole different story. History is by far the most inaccurate kind of class. As history changes depending on the perspective/geographical location/political agenda/personal preference/time. And this could account for ''small differences'' in history around the globe. But there is also this thing were you leave specific information out of subject. Which is far worse, as I believe that is a light form of censorship. Because leaving a small part out, or minimizing an factor could totally change people's views.  

I think we rely to much on the rinse &amp; repeat system. Which is outdated. The information presented in school is outdated. The books the children get are already a few years old, based on even older information. An example I still remember is having an 5 year old book (somewhere in 2004). To still work with outdated printed books instead of a forum were information can evolve and corrected - is unbelievable to me. But as we all know, progression gets driven away by people who don't benefit from that change. And not even talking about the amount of paper from workbooks etc wasted.

In this case that would be the *~~cancerous~~* ''publishing'' companies who benefit from this. They sell you a bundle for all your books which you need for that year. Lets say you have to pay 500. At the end of the year, they will attempt to buy the books off you again. Which you will usually do. Only you only get 125 back if you are lucky. Then that same exact year, the same books will be sold again to another person for 500. This happens in the Netherlands.

An system based on software and interactive teaching will be more cost efficient, environment friendlier. 

Now there are a lot of classes which are not getting taught at all. Things in life that you are gonna have to deal with every day in life. things like emotions, relationships, arguments and you know - just talking to people. 
Basic psychology will improve not only your insight in these issues, but it will also make people more tolerant to each other; as someone else his perspective is not as hard to see anymore. 
One could also argue that understanding certain things like [cognitive dissonance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), [information bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_bias_(psychology) or [gambler's fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler's_fallacy) could help a person in various ways. There are probably better examples out there. 
I think that the psychology and discussion/debate go hand in hand. 

I truly believe that if you want a better world you have to start by teaching *how* kids can think, not *what* they should think.
Teach them logic, teach them how to debate, teach them basic psychology. The result of this would be that people would correct each other more - and that would be a big change. 

I think if the basic premise of this would be applied to the world, people would have a more fitting worldview.

1365820682.0,85,self.changemyview,1c8ym3,I think that the Men's Rights and Feminism subreddits do more harm than good. CMV,best_kind_of_loser,109,24,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1c8ym3/i_think_that_the_mens_rights_and_feminism/,"I thought about posting this in Men's Rights (since it's three times bigger than Feminism and seems a lot more active), but I don't think I'd get the kind of open-minded discussion I'm looking for there.  

Whenever I'm reading through a thread linking to an article that depicts one sex in a negative light (rape, domestic abuse, false rape accusations, etc.), it seems inevitable that I come across some MRA/feminism discussion somewhere in the comments.  The first few times I saw this happening, I tried to follow the discussion for any compelling arguments, but it always somehow spiraled into absurdity.   I started skipping over most of those sections whenever I came across them, writing them off as a waste of time.

Until one day when I was reading one of these threads, I came across someone who said, ""I really only read the Men's Rights sub when I'm on reddit.""  A quick look in his comment history proved his statement to be true.  Then I started doing that whenever I came across a sexism discussion on a thread I was reading.  I'd say 7 out of 10 times, the user's comment history had 80% of their comments in either /r/mensrights, /r/feminism, or /r/shitredditsays... (usually the former two subs, as SRS comments are always downvoted to the bottom of most threads).  


I've looked through several threads on both subreddits, and aside from links to interesting articles, I guess I just don't see the good that they're doing.  The rational, intelligent conversations in those places are few and far in between... name-calling and berating seem to be commonplace, and this definitely spills out into the rest of reddit.  


Have I misinterpretted the point of these places?  I see them as a little destructive and somewhat counter-productive to their cause.  Some of these users seem like impressionable people who have spent so much time in these places that their views are completely shaped by them.  


As a disclaimer:  I'm not gonna pretend I know what it's like as a man in this day and age, just as I don't think it's possible for a man to know what it's like to be a woman.  I acknowledge there are assholes, idiots, and all-around terrible examples of both sexes and that these people do not represent either sex as a whole.  

I kind of see these subs the same way as I see /r/atheism now... they've lost sight of the big picture and have almost become parodies of the things they're supposed to be against.  Where hivemind mentality breeds and overrides any sort of outside influence.  And where there seems to be a common theme of users who tend to obsess over these issues above all else.

Tell me why these subreddits are more than just circlejerks for bitching about the opposite sex.  I'd like to know if there's some kind of positive influence that I'm missing.  And I'd like to know if I'm being narrow-minded for seeing those subreddits that way.  Maybe I'm just as judgemental as I'm accusing them of being?

Most people had to perform physically intensive work as farmers. 

This means that most women in the past had to be continuously pregnant, and they had to care for a lot of children: most babies would not become adults. They also had to do things like making clothes. 

Since then, progress in technology and medicine has changed a lot. You don't need to give birth to five or six children. You don't have to expect to die at age 40. We buy our clothes in stores instead of making them ourselves. We have freezers, (dish)washers and dryers. We don't need to perform physically intensive work on the field or in the factory; most of us work in the [service sector](http://www.minnpost.com/sites/default/files/images/articles/distoflaborforcebysector.png).

These drastic changes obviously affect the lives of women. They have to lead a different life than they did in 1850. But this is not because they were freed from oppression by the patriarchy - this is because our society has changed more between 1850 and now then it has between [1850 and the Dark Ages](http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/file2/publication/article/SAAMAG/28390/pending/morris_graph_2_1.gif).

Men and women aren't equal. Pre-industrial gender roles are generally the same in all cultures; men perform physically intensive work, they are soldiers and politicians, while women generally work in and around the house and raise the children.

Gender roles have to change because our society has changed and is changing quickly, meaning older gender roles are outdated. Culture has to adapt to technological and scientific progress.

This causes shorter people to be passed up for promotions, pay raises, generally receive less social status, and be the butt end of deprecating comments which harm their self-esteem.

If street art is, in fact, art, then these young, poor artists should be paid for their service to the community.

CMV",Pandaemonium,107,19,219,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d0bmb/the_most_important_function_of_government_is/,"It's often stated that the most important function of government is security, but I disagree with this - it's actually *stewardship* that is the most important function. After all, what good is keeping the current generation safe if we use up all of our resources doing so, leaving nothing for the next generation?

Conservation of our natural (and intellectual, industrial, etc.) resources is a task the government is uniquely suited for.  In a free market environment such as the one coveted by Libertarians and AnCaps, everyone is essentially out for themselves, and are encouraged to consume as much of our resources as they can if they feel it can give them some sort of advantage.  No one is tasked with watching out for future generations - no one has the power to make people stop burning oil and burning the rain forests because it doesn't necessarily cause harm to this generation, even though it could devastate our future generations.  

The only incentive, ecologically, for stewardship in a market environment is watching out for your direct descendants, but if everyone is only watching out for themself and theirs, there's still a massive incentive to slash and burn the environment, etc. if it provides wealth.  After all, if your descendants are only paying one ten-billionth of the cost but reaping the entire benefit, you are still incentivized to consume and not conserve.

Governments, because they (at least are intended to) last many generations, have skin in the game on preserving natural, intellectual, industrial, etc. resources for the future.  Additionally, by virtue of being composed of the whole population, they don't have the same ""privatized profit, socialized loss"" mechanism that individuals have, because they instead balance socialized profit vs. socialized loss.

I can't claim that government always does a perfect job of stewardship, but at least ""big government"" HAS A MECHANISM IN PLACE that **can** rationally practice stewardship.  Libertarianism, by its very nature, **does not** preserve stewardship and thus cannot form a solid long-term basis for a high-functioning society.

**UPDATE:** Thanks everyone for the great discussion!  Unfortunately, I did not see any posters give any concrete answers for how a libertarian society can protect future generations, so I cannot yet award a delta.  The closest that I came to being swayed is the suggestion that class-action lawsuits could be taken against offenders, HOWEVER, with no proposed way that class-action lawsuits could be taken on behalf of future persons, even this solution fails the test of stewardship.

I feel that the most common response to my post was ""current states don't do a good job of stewardship either."" While this may be true, it doesn't alter my claim that a libertarian society **cannot** do a good job of stewardship, whereas a state with a relatively forward-thinking leadership could do an effective job. The fact that most current states do a poor job doesn't excuse the fact that a Libertarian government would institutionalize a complete lack of stewardship *as part of its fundamental mechanism, the free market.*  FURTHERMORE, I believe that environmental conservation laws, when they have been passed, have been extremely effective at reducing pollution of rivers, reducing smog, improving efficiency standards, and preserving our natural landscape.  My conclusion is that IF the political will exists, a strong state can do an excellent job of stewardship, so the fundamental problem comes not from the functioning of the state, but from the mobilization of political public sentiment.  Thus, while market-based solutions cannot possibly protect future generations (and I'm still open to being swayed on that claim,) a strong government has a clear way to provide the necessary stewardship, and further efforts should be made at the level of education, organization, and mobilization of citizens concerned with stewardship and sustainability, rather than requiring any sort of overhaul of government.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1367006013.0,,,True,t3_1d0bmb,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d0bmb/the_most_important_function_of_government_is/,

As an individual, I'm relatively liberal-leaning in my views, politics, and philosophies: I support equality for all races, sexes, genders and sexualities under the law, and I should specify right now that I do not believe that people should not have the right to change their gender. That being said, I do not believe that people who elect to undergo sexual reassignment surgery, or even just those who identify as another sex should receive any special treatment. **Ultimately, I see sexual reassignment surgery as plastic surgery, an elective procedure to bring one's mental image of oneself in line with one's physical image of oneself, and a supreme expression of vanity.** I am allowed to criticize, say, a woman who gets breast enlargement surgery but not a man who does that, takes hormones, and gets his genitals mutilated to superficially resemble a vagina.

I admit to being a layman in the field of psychology and neurology, but gender dysmorphia seems to be a mental illness, but the only one that I know of that's treated with elective, cosmetic plastic surgery. And yet, in the circles I run in (generally liberal in the American sense of the term, and including a smattering of GLBT individuals- and I am in no way complaining about that) trans individuals are afforded some form of protected status where they are above criticism and I am to not only treat them gingerly but modify the entire way I speak about them due to a cosmetic change, and yet I am not expected to do the same when someone I know gets a new haircut or nails.



People have told me this is an intolerant view, and, moreover, that this intolerant view is surprisingly out of place considering my other values- but I cannot see anything wrong with it and, to me, it makes sense (perhaps not necessarily being airtight).

I submit that every single female child should get an implant before puberty (until they can find one for males, in which case all males should get one too). The implant would be removed when the person could provide proof of their ability to support a child/ren. We are required to provide proof of our ability to pay for pretty much everything these days (if we want to get a loan etc) so why not have to provide proof that you are able to support a child.

Of course I know that life happens and that things are not always hunky dory. People lose jobs/have accidents etc etc and sometimes end up poor even after a pretty good beginning BUT it is a fact that MOST people will end up in the same income bracket as their parents therefore why don't we legislate for more stable families?

Once you have had your child, you would be re-implanted with the birth control until you can prove again that you can afford a next child.

The discussion generally centres around the ways in which Iran's nuclear capabilities can be stopped and works on the assumption that firstly, a nuclear armed Iran would be dangerous and that it shouldn't be allowed nuclear weapons. 

Firstly, I'd contest that a nuclear armed Iran would be dangerous to the West. Combined, the West has substantially more nuclear weapons than Iran could  hope to possess. There's no threat of Iran firing these weapons at a Western country because the result would be either the decimation of Iran through a nuclear retaliation or a land invasion that would destroy and cripple the nation. If North Korea won't use it's nuclear stockpiles, I'd say it's safe to say Iran won't. 

Secondly, I don't think the West is in a position to deny Iran nuclear weapons given the amount the West possesses. Given the fact that America has shown it is willing to militarily intervene in the middle east and even invade whole countries, a country on Iran's border, it is fair for the Iranians to want a deterrent. 

The fear of Iran in the west is unjustified and while the West keeps it's stockpiles of nuclear weapons and continues to operate so openly in the middle east is fair and expected for the countries therein to create deterrents to Western attack.

I know this sounds terribly racist, and I apologize for offending people because I really do understand that people are often going to meet what expectations you set for them and not much more.

I am an open-minded and liberal white Southerner who has grown up with little exposure to black culture. However, what little I have seen seems to support criminal or irresponsible behavior. This is not to say that black people are all criminals or irresponsible, just that the general culture encourages these activities.

Hip-hop, the predominant choice of music for many black Americans, often promotes organized crime, prostitution, gun use, drug use, etc.

Crime rates are MUCH higher among black males than any other demographic in the United States. I find it extremely hard to believe that this is entirely due to racial discrimination.

Granted I do not know many black people, but of the ones I do know, it honestly seems like black people are typically much lazier (but I know some black people who do not fit this definition at all). I know that's not a scientific study at all, but a much higher percentage are unemployed, heavy drug users or alcoholics, or never try very hard in school, even in college. Unemployment rates are much higher among blacks than any other race. Again, I find it hard to believe this is entirely due to discrimination.

Black people are often more disrespectful than any other group (just a reminder, this is in my experience. I won't pretend like this is a scientific fact). There is a large black population on my campus, and anytime I have a class with a group of black students, it seems like those students will be very disrespectful to the professor or other students, e.g. interrupting class, coming in late, listening to music so loud on their headphones that everybody in the room can hear it. It's such an unfailing stereotype for me that I've come to dread anytime I see a large group of black students in my classes.

I know there are bad apples and good apples in every orchard. I feel bad because I often have these kinds of thoughts, and I am honestly no quicker to judge a black person I meet as a bad person than any other race.

However, I have noticed a common tendency amongst 20something Americans who have recently graduated from university, especially if they were in the arts and humanities: a confidence in their opinion, an assertion that they are right, and that they somehow understand human nature better than anyone else. This gets to the point of asserting their opinion as fact even when it's patently untrue.

The most common way this gets manifested is when people talk to me about Asian cultures. I'm Asian--South Korean. Especially on Reddit, but to a certain point off the internet, it is not uncommon for white Americans to assert that the obsession with cosmetic surgery, eye surgery, and light skin are because South Koreans want to look western. This is something they were taught in school--imperialistic views of beauty were imposed on Asians.

But it's also completely false. Koreans have been trying to keep their skin light since the 18th century at least, before they had pretty much any contact with foreigners. Also, a lot of Asians have large eyes--larger than many westerners.

No one in the Korean media suggests that these trends are because of western influence, and if you asked the average person in Korea about it, they'd think you're crazy.

Now, when I've tried to tell non-Asian Americans this, they immediately dismiss it, asserting what they learned in school. This shocks me. I was taught a lot about America in Korean schools that turned out to be completely false. When visiting America, then after moving here, I would take every opportunity to listen to Americans about what it's really like, instead of asserting that what I learned in school was right and what the subject himself is actually telling me is wrong.

I've been trying to figure out why this is the case, but it is everywhere in America. Every political debate, every argument, whether on the internet or in person, seems to be more about proving your own point rather than learning or trying to compromise.

But as I grew older I began to doubt what I believed in. I realized I might just have been feeling what I was told to by my parents. I read things in the bible that I didn't agree with, and began to dislike the Christian role models a saw around me. Finally I realized I didn't really believe in God at all anymore.

But I soon realized that without my belief in God the world is starkly meaningless. There's no moral code that says ""this is right"" and ""that is wrong,"" there is no goal, and no matter what, I'll be gone in 70 years or so... POOF, just like that and goodbye world.

EDIT:  To clarify my thoughts further: Fluctuations in speed are really what cause traffic jams.  My contention is that human incompetence is to blame for the vast majority of fluctuations in speed.

EDIT #2:  I understand what happens when cars start slowing down, I understand the impact that has all the way back.  That's not up for debate.  My point is the root cause of the slow down to begin with.  Why do the cars have to slow down?  Discount things like accidents (most of the time you will see evidence of this when it's the cause) or other forms of obstacles in the road.  Someone here posted a really good video of what happens when it's just a bunch of cars going around in a circle.  There was no obstacle but they ended up clumping up anyway.  I think that experiment was set up to fail because they're forced to follow each other too closely and they're not race car drivers.  I still believe that a huge portion of traffic congestion is caused by people doing things they shouldn't be doing and that they could easily avoid doing if they were just paying more attention (and sometimes it's just ignorance).  One area that I'm willing to concede a change in view is  that bottlenecks do play a much bigger role when it can appear there is no cause to the slowdown.

These increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming, like crop rotation, better plowing tools, use of animal labour, use of manure as fertilizer, breeding of crops and livestock, chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides, and, as of late, genetic modification of crops.

Today is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. 

I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies, and is what we here know as a ""first world problem"". This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more wide-spread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.

I don't contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the risk/benefit balance right, and yes, there are risks, hazards and dangers associated with them. I don't contest either, that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good, especially when used naively.

However, science and engineering progress all the time, pesticides become better, more specific, fertilizers become better to handle, cheaper and less energy-intensive to produce, GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past, that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.

And thus, I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad, and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods, using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as ""bad"" while labelling something that came out of a cow's arse as somehow magically ""good"", and instead have a sane cost/benefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.

I don't like transsexual people being grouped with gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals because the issue is so much more than just sexual orientation. It's straight up biological modification and there are expected social consequences associated with changing your gender. It's an unnatural procedure that seems completely unprecedented in nature. And to me, the decision to become trans is brought about my a mental conclusion that a rational and mentally stable person could never come to. I don't see how it's possible to not identify with your given gender, since it's the only gender you've ever known. And I don't think we each have a gender we were ""meant to be"". I understand not identifying with socially constructed gender roles (I have problems with my assigned male gender roles to a certain degree). But that is problem that can be dealt with in other ways other than literally becoming a different gender.

The video was titled ""Why Multicultralism is An Epic Fail [sic]"", and Reddit upvoted it over 4K times with a net approval of 65%. The Youtuber who posted the video claims that the people in the audience were already aware of the contents of the anti-Islamic film before viewing that, although no proof of this was given. Thus, this premise that these people came willing to watch something attacking them and their religion is mainly an assumption. Assuming that the people did know that they would watch an offensive video, their behavior was not OK; however, if they were told the film was to be something else and acted this was in objection to what was happening, the behavior may have been an overreaction, but slightly justified. Like I said, there is no proof of the context outside of what the **admittedly biased** youtuber posted (Who else would title a video ""Why Multiculturalism is An Epic Fail"").

Moving on to Reddit's response. I pulled some of the top comments and their net upvotes.

""Just boot these filthy immigrants out of the country."" - 32 points

""Why do people think multiculturalism is a good thing? They are fucking animals."" - 9 points

""Allahu Akbar is one of the most annoying noises I have ever heard."" - 1146 points

""And thus why I think Islam is the downfall of humanity."" - 51 points

""Muslims acting like spoiled children? Never!"" - 164 points

Now when some people tried to respond calling out Reddit on this ridiculously racist response, they were 'downvoted into oblivion'. I'm sick of Reddit claiming to be tolerant of all people and cultures and attacking leaders, countries and policies that are racist and unequal, but then having a ridiculously ignorant, bigoted and racist response at something like this.

I know that I shouldn't take this instance and stereotype it to all of Reddit, just as I would hope people not take this video and stereotype it to all people of the Islamic faith, but going through all the comments and discussion on the Youtube page and the thread is extremely irritating.

I'll start with the main problem: fat people are socially-acceptable in good ol' America these days. That's a problem. But I digress:

I live in midwest USA; Missouri, to be precise. There's a huge meth presence out here. Growing up, there was three meth labs within a hundred yards of my house. One exploded, and the other two got shut down.

You can tell a meth addict from a mile away: they're like living skeletons. Teeth rotting out, malnourished, eyes sunken, skin almost translucent, and so skinny they look like a Holocaust victim. Some of them have sores on their bodies. They're downright revolting to look upon.

Being a meth addict, of course, is not socially acceptable. However, only around 1-2% of the US population are actually meth addicts.

But on the other end are the other addicts. Fat people are addicts to food, and they are addicts to an unhealthy lifestyle. And our society is taught to accept them? This might be because the majority of Americans are obese, but I find it disgusting.

You can tell an obese person from a mile away: panting, physically incapable of simple tasks, often covered in sweat, having difficulty moving or functioning. Large, sagging growths of fat hanging off of them.

And yet these are the people who are being praised on social media, despite the fact that over TWO-THIRDS of the U.S. are technically obese. We are taught to accept these people as they are, and that it's OK to be fat. It's being compassionate, right?

Wrong. We are forced to be compassionate, but the fat people who make our lives more difficult do nothing but soak up resources. The obese currently cost more to the U.S. than smokers in terms of health care. Seats in stadiums are forced to be made wider to accomodate ""heavier-built"" occupants. Extra gas bought to accomodate the weight of the obese in vehicles equals 1% of daily gas spendings in America. Over a billion dollars. Airlines are forced to pay more money for fuel because of heavy people dangerously weighing down airplanes.

There's always excuses, of course.
""Fat people can't afford to be skinny!"" (obvious bullshit, considering unhealthy food costs considerably more than healthy food)
""Some people have diseases that make them fat!"" (maybe in 1-2% of the obese population, but in fact obesity causes more diseases such as diabetes and heart disease)
""It's genetic!"" (some genes cause people to be more obesity-prone, but this should not impede them much if they actually made effort to watch their weight)

Why am I supposed to accept, respect, or feel sorry for those who don't take care of themselves and cause everyone else more problems on a daily basis? Furthermore, why should I respect them when so many fat people I have met both online and offline cuss and whine at me for not accepting their disgusting, misshapen bodies and the problems they cause?

There exists an EXTENSIVE literature demonstrating cognitive, physical, temperamental, and hormonal differences among races (there are three races typically noted in psychological science: caucasians, africans, and east-asian). These findings use methodologies like adoption studies, neuro-imaging, and, yes... correlations- but, importantly, a substantial amount of studies can be interpreted as being caused by inherent genetic factors, NOT societal factors.

Aside from established science, it just seems logical to me that people who migrated from Africa some 60,000 years ago faced different cognitive conditions and evolved in different ways.

The class should be more than just playing dodge ball or kick ball, and should be more focused on activities that are actually beneficial, like jogging for 20 minutes straight. Not getting pegged in the face with a red ball. 
Students should also be graded on a basis of effort, not just if they changed into a white shirt and blue shorts. For example, a thin, healthy student walks the whole time during the jogging session versus an obese student who walks/jogs intermittently. 

I believe this class should be required every year.


People with disabilities or special circumstances are exempt, of course.

tl;dr Schools should be required to keep our kids from getting fat with mandatory athletics, regardless of the students' present physical condition.  

EDIT: Performance based grading seems to be a little bit confusing for some, and I'll admit I didn't put forth an effort to really clarify what I want. Let me give an example.
We are required to take an art class in public schools, at least I was. I have no artistic talent when it comes to a pen or a brush, so everything I made looked like crap. I was still given a good grade because I put forth the effort to make something, even if it was terrible. 

I basically want the grading to be based on whether the student exerted himself and tried his best. If the muscle bound jock decides he wants to walk around the track, dicking off, he gets a poor grade for the day. As opposed to the overweight nerd who is breaking a sweat, who would be given an A for the day. 
It would be a pass or fail situation, no D's, C's, or B's. Do or do not, there is no try. 

At the end of the class, every student should be tired and sweaty. At the end of the class I took called ""Strength and Conditioning,"" which is basically PE on steroids, everyone was dead tired and sweaty. I was probably the least fit person in the class but didn't feel self conscious, because I worked as hard as everyone else. Sure I couldn't bench my weight, but I did the most I could. 

Also, we had showers and used them. We wore bathing suits. I think they would be necessary for this idea of PE that I have to work.

Essentially the fact that due to low wages we are subsidizing Walmarts. Note this is specifically aimed at the USA since I live there. It probably applies to other countries as well.

The often trumpeted ""solution"" to this problem is a higher minimum wage. Something like double the current. The problem is that raising the minimum wage doesn't actually change the market pressures. If the market wage is below the minimum wage less people will be hired. To change the market wage either the supply or the demand would have to change. A minimum wage does neither.

Unemployment benefits on the other hand would lower the supply. People would now have a better option. A business couldn't have incredibly low wages because people would just stay with the unemployment benefits.

The fact that these are unemployment benefits vs just a check everyone gets is critical. The latter is close to our current system. People below a certain threshold, the poverty level, get benefits to help them survive. This is much better than the alternative, but it leads to things like the Walmart where much of the profit is in fact coming out of the taxpayers pockets.

Just to get this out of the way here's some common objections I've received and my response:

*  **Wouldn't this lead to freeloaders?**

   Yes, that's the entire point, but it could be minimized by keeping the benefits fairly low. Enough to keep yourself above water, but not fun.

* **Isn't the government big enough already?**

  That's why I'm interested in what I might be missing here. My gut agrees with this, but I can't come up with why.

* **Scams/implementation?**

  This is probably the biggest problem I can come up with. What to do about the almost 50% of Americans who aren't officially employed? That would probably have to be something like benefits=unemployment benefits-income.

So does my live-in boyfriend and soon to be fiance, and we've been discussing having them a few years down the line. We're financially responsible, and net in about 30K a year together. No food stamps, just simple living, etc. This would be an adventure we'd take in our late twenties, and we're only early/mid twenties now.

The problem is, when I look at the future, I am absolutely terrified for any future kids of mine. I certainly can't afford a degree for them, I can barely afford one for ME. I find our public school system lacking and the job market lacking any more. Connections were the only thing that got me this job, I don't think blindly fishing works anymore.

I'm very happy about the advancement of medicine, antibiotics, hospital care. I know my child will be healthy... but happy? I'm not sure.

Racism, classism and other bigotries still run rampant. Violence is everywhere, I can't walk around at night comfortably without packing heat. We're both white, so I suppose I shouldn't worry about the racism bit, but what if I have a gay or lesbian child? What if they're mentally ill? What if they're smaller and weaker? I feel like I can't protect them.

This may seem strange but I am sincerely already scared for a child I don't yet have... But I would love children and so would my boyfriend. Please give me some hope, or tell me what I can do to stop problems before they start. 

Note: I live in the Pacific Northwest, U.S.

Biggest concerns:

* horrific job market

* even worse public school system

* inability to pay for college

* archaic society

1374231651.0,77,self.changemyview,1imhkx,I think that fiscal conservatism and libertarianism are morally unjustifiable. CMV.,Falsum2,116,39,241,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1imhkx/i_think_that_fiscal_conservatism_and/,"This view comes from the simple observation that, for whatever reason, our current capitalist economies tend to pay the people who do certain jobs less than they need to survive. In the United States, for example, a janitor is unlikely to be able to afford health insurance, and will therefore be ruined if she gets cancer. She will likely have to live in an unsafe neighborhood, and if she has children they will be very unlikely to be able to afford post-secondary education, meaning that they will be effectively sentenced to the same set of circumstances.

This problem can be avoided through the provision of tax-funded government services such as public health care, subsidized tuition, and housing policy. The conservative argument that such services should be minimized or eliminated altogether therefore implies that the janitor and her family *should* be subjected to these circumstances. In other words, that people who do certain jobs deserve to suffer for it. To my mind, any moral justification of conservatism needs to provide a defense of this point. Since this point is indefensible, the moral case for conservatism falls.

The first reply to this that I might anticipate is that nobody forced the janitor to be a janitor. If she wants to improve her circumstances, she should take night school, develop a skill, start a business, or otherwise work to improve her circumstances. This seems naive to me. If all the janitors did this, then who would clean the floors? We need janitors, and if they all decide to get bootstrappy and improve their circumstances, then we will have lost an important service. Why do the people who provide this service deserve to live in worse conditions than people who provide other services?

The second possible reply has to do with the ultimate impact of deregulation and the elimination of taxation. An unregulated economy, some people say, will reduce the prices of goods and services to the point that janitors are better able to afford them than they would have been with government assistance. My first response to this is that there is no real evidence that it is true-countries with more fiscally conservative policies tend to have worse social welfare for the working class, and pure libertarianism is a completely untested economic system. My second response is that even if this argument is correct, and conservative policies will eventually create a rising tide that lifts all boats, this still ignores the situation of the working class *today*, who would be effectively sacrificed in order to obtain these future benefits. This is not an ethical trade-off in my view.

Lastly is the moral argument that taxation is theft-an absolute moral wrong that should be eliminated or minimized regardless of what benefit it might bring. I think this argument fails to notice the social construction of wealth: infrastructure, the labour force, education, policing, national security, environmental protections, health care, and market policy are all part of a system we have created to facilitate the generation of wealth. Wealth is therefore socially created. In most countries, we have decided, sensibly I think, that it makes sense to award a greater share of the wealth generated by our system to those who have the skills and initiative to create and improve products and services-the CEOs, investors, and entrepreneurs of the world. But that is a consequences of the rules we have written for the economic game, not the consequence of some absolute moral law about who deserves to reap the greatest profits of capitalism. If we want to change the rules to allocate some more of that wealth to the bottom tiers, then we have that moral right. If you don't buy that argument, then I can make a simpler one: What is a greater moral wrong, forcing a billionaire to get by on a few hundred million, or forcing the aforementioned janitor to get by without health care or nutrition? I think the greater harm obviously rests in the latter case.

My burden of proof for this is not very high. I don't need you to convince me to *become* a fiscal conservative, only to concede that an ethical, rational person who is reasonably aware of the real world can be a fiscal conservative. Basically, prove to me that this is an issue on which reasonable people can disagree.

If the wife doesn't try to leave and gets hit again on a different occasion, I think she's somewhat responsible. She will continue to be abused until learns a very valuable lesson. The lesson isn't ""have dinner ready"", the lesson is really ""don't let people treat you like crap, or you will get treated like crap."" I'm not saying it's 100% the fault of the wife, but I think the blame is 50/50.

""They can't leave if the husband provides for her."" Yes they can. She can stay with her family for free, and if that's not an option, there are battered women shelters for that very reason.

Are they really a victim if they're a willing participant? I can kind of see with emotional abuse, because the line is blurry, but with physical abuse, it's not. A man strikes you or he doesn't. To me, it's very black and white. I guess my main gripe is, if they know a man hits them and they choose to not leave, doesn't that make them a willing participant in an abusive relationship? Even worse, when they leave, and then run back to the abuser shortly after. It happens all the fucking time, I've seen it myself. Over and over. Don't act like it doesn't.

Anyone with an ounce of emotional maturity would know that it's the cycle of abuse, not love. 

One thing that really gets me is when the woman has kids and doesn't leave. Either leave the relationship or move the kid in with someone else. If you're living that way, you're not fit to care for a child and you shouldn't subject a child to your poor life decisions. You can change your life and living conditions, kids can't.

**Original Post:**

I think it is important to know at the top of this description that I've never been in a romantic relationship of any kind. I have been plagued with various illnesses which affect my outward appearance and have made me, and continue to make me, unattractive.

That, however, is not the issue at hand.

Last August I was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. With medication and vitamin supplements we can slow the progress of the disease, but there is no medication-- nor any medication on the horizon-- that can heal the damage, or truly halt the course of the disease.

I could go my whole life without ever being disabled in anyway, but then again, I could be crippled or worse pretty much at any time in my future.

In this way, I believe willfully entering an intimate relationship with someone else would be offloading a colossal and unfair responsibility upon that person to take care of me in such an outcome. It is one thing when an accident occurs unexpectedly and one partner must take care of another-- but to know that accident is considerably more likely than just random accidents and to put someone in that position is horribly selfish and morally wrong.

This is all besides the point that I doubt I would be appealing to anyone at any point. My many sicknesses leave me small, frail, pale and discolored. But should any of these things change, or someone happen to find me appealing, I believe it is morally correct to decline.

**EDIT:** I keep hearing the same non-argument to this, which is that I am somehow making someone else's decisions for them. As I have said repeatedly, a relationship is two consenting adults who each make a choice to enter into the relationship. My choice to foster and enter into the relationship is the one I am viewing as immoral. If you want to participate in this conversation, you should be presenting me with reasons why that choice isn't immoral, not reasons why **I have no right to make that decision in opposition to someone else's desire to be with me**. That is describing a non-consensual relationship.

Merriam describes respect as being a ""high or special regard"" but that's quite vague, so let's define what I believe most people think of as ""respect"". 

**Respect -** *the social obligation to hold someone's existence to a higher regard than other people.*

What I'm arguing is that this is wrong to force this onto other people.

1. This is an unhealthy burden to put on the young people of the world. Respect usually signifies a higher intelligence, but what if the ""elders"" in question are wrong? If they are always told to respect their elders, then it can difficult for them to distinguish when someone can be passing along faulty information or wrong morals in the future.

2. Believing respect is given can give out the opposite effect. If the ""respected"" is actually a cruel person(s) then why do the respectees need to respect this person? Rebellion begins, trust can crumble, and there can be no actual respect between the two parties. Only a false sense of self-regard.

3. Why do we even believe in this credo in the first place? At what point did we think that we could just go about our will and expect those who we percieve as ""below us"" to respect us? I believe this develops unhealthy relationships between people and only causes problems.

By which I mean: it is true that you might be distributing your data on a technological layer, BUT you are still giving it into the hands of a SINGLE company. On a corporate layer, this constitutes a **single point of failure**.

Recent news are the best example, as virtually all your data can be looked into with just a few back doors into the current major cloud data storage services. Imagine if we kept all our data on our computers, properly downloaded our email like in the ""good 'ol times"" and used many different companies, each specialized for their respective task (i.e. not use google for everything!), how (iilegally) obtaining a full picture of a single person becomes exponentially more difficult.

I think we should revert to saving our music and pictures on our own machines, use email or IRC instead of facebook and promote setting up servers for personalized, private cloud services and distribute the information that we are willing to publicize about us over as many services as possible.

The Internet was designed from ground up to be distributed so that a single failing node would not even cause a disturbance in the whole network. Now, it is falling into the hands of a few corporations, obtaining the power to divert traffic like the some internet police. Imagine if google suddenly fell for some odd reason how it would literally take the internet with it.

I can't see how this isn't a system of thieving from those who aren't born into riches.

I don't think of myself as an anti-capitalist, and I see the value produced by investors allocating capital efficiently and such, I just think everyone should have an equal as possible chance of getting to own some means of production.

Below is a repost of my comment from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1fm5ca/britain_and_the_world_can_no_longer_afford_to/cac6gev?context=3), which lays out the meat of my thesis:

&gt;I feel like the fact that wealth/capital/land can be accumulated and passed down through generations without being mostly removed in tax is basically feudalism, since the bulk of society will have to pay rent to the land-owners, who can exist happily, and indeed live lavishly, by mere virtue of having inherited these assets and thus getting everyone else to work for them.

&gt;I understand wanting to provide for one's kids, and I think you should be able to leave some amount of wealth to them, but I can't see how being able to command millions of dollars of assets and have others pay you for use of them by birthright isn't fantastically* unjust and morally equivalent to having an aristocracy and a peasant class who serves them and claiming this is the divinely ordained order of things.

&gt;*I couldn't think of any superlative strong enough to use here. It honestly seems like bare-faced evil to me. It's the most profoundly anti-egalitarian thing I can see being defended and promoted by real people. Maybe capital accumulation is necessary for productive investments, but even if we accept that it should be distributed by luck and merit, not by bloody birth. Even with 100% inheritance and gift tax the children of the rich would have a huge advantage in life, giving them huge wadges of productive assets that the rest of society will have to pay them to use as well, boggles my mind.

Edit: Anyone new here, a lot of this is straying from what I originally had in mind. I'm looking for people to explain why my conception of the injustice of this might be incorrect. I'm picturing society/ the economy as a zero sum game (although of course it's growing), and people who consume without producing, merely living off the rents of assets, seem to be parasites off of everyone else. In the case of earned income, maybe this is a fair reward for creating value, and maybe it helps allocate capital efficiently, lets accept that for the sake of argument. But for dynastic wealth, it seems like pure parasitism to me, and the beneficial effects of that capital being invested could be captured as well or better if it was in the hands of someone who had earned it rather than inherited it. This is what I want challenged, not the fine details of the tax system.

*

Edit Again: 

tl;dr: Wealth attracts wealth, and makes it easy to live a life of luxury off the work others do. Let's assume this is a fair reward for wealth creators and a good incentive to invest wisely. IMHO it is still deeply unjust (and probably inefficient) to give this (necessary, but very desirable/cushy/agreeable) role in society to an aristocracy, rather than to people who have made their fortunes by merit (which does happen on the margins today, but a heck of a lot of money is old money, and that seems to be getting worse) CMV.

Look through my more recent comments to see where we've gotten to. I'm still struggling to see how this could be considered fair.

Because I believe Libertarianism is selfishness turned into a political philosophy, that is all. The only Liberty in Libertarianism is the liberty to amputate yourself from society and only opt to care about your fellow countrymen when it suites you.

It is a well established fact since the time of the Romans that taxation works. If you want nice things from your government, it needs the money to pay for them. Now Libertarians do not want the government to have nice things- thus causing deregulation and lowering taxation. However they never stopped to consider that maybe People less fortune then them NEED these things from the Government to survive; and it would be sure nice to drive on a road without potholes.

Libertarians bemoan how big government is a problem and it needs to be downsized. Government is big because it needs to govern a big population and a big Area effectively. Granted Bureaucracy can often be stifling, but only with the active participation in government can it be fixed. You don't amputate your hand when you get a paper cut. Furthermore Regulation are there for a reason. when economies are completely unregulated- despite sometimes good intentions- they move towards wrecking themselves. It is a historical fact. I know the world is looking for solutions in the wake of the GFC- Libertarian Economics is not it. Most mainstream economists regard the work of Libertarian poster economist Ludwig Von Mises as bunk. Furthermore I would point out that the Austrian School as whole has flaws in regards to mathematical and scientific rigor. 

This country was not founded by Libertarians they built this government so it could be expanded and tweaked in order to create a more perfect union. Not to be chopped up piecemeal and transformed into a feudal backwater. Also there is a reason why Ron Paul is not president- not because of the mainstream media censoring him- it is because his ideas are BAD, even by the standards of the GOP.

Charity and Compassion are intrinsic to the human social experience- without them your just vain, selfish and someone who does not want to participate in the Human experience.

Instead of recognizing that his illiberal and backwards ideology has *human* opponents, he thinks progressive people are being helped by the *devil and the Antichrist*. Seriously. This man cannot distinguish between the real world and fairy tales. 

This was not something he said jokingly in a private conversation. In July 2010, just three years ago, when Argentina considered legalizing gay marriage, he wrote in a letter to Argentina's cloistered nuns: 

&gt;In the coming weeks, the Argentine people will face a situation whose outcome can seriously harm the family...**At stake is the identity and survival of the family**: father, mother and children. At stake are the lives of many children who will be discriminated against in advance, and deprived of their human development given by a father and a mother and willed by God. **At stake is the total rejection of God's law** engraved in our hearts.

&gt;Let's not be naive: This is not a simple political fight; it is a destructive proposal to God's plan. This is not a mere legislative proposal (that's just its form), but **a move by the father of lies** that seeks to confuse and deceive the children of God... Let's look to St. Joseph, Mary, and the Child to ask fervently that they defend the Argentine family in this moment... May they support, defend, and accompany us in this **war of God**.

&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_francis#Same-sex_marriage

The 'father of lies' is a name for the devil used by Jesus in the Bible. This man believes in 'God's law' and holy war! He thinks giving equal rights to homosexual couples will end the ""survival of the family"". His ideology is illiberal and theocratic. 

Maybe you remember Benedict XVI criticizing an American organization of female Catholics last year, because they were *'tinged with feminist influences, focused too much on ending social and economic injustice and not enough on stopping abortion, and permitted speakers at its meetings who questioned church doctrine'*. Pope Francis [reaffirmed this reprimand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_francis#Early_issues).

&gt; **Indoctrination**

&gt; It is often distinguished from education by the fact that the indoctrinated person is expected not to question or critically examine the doctrine they have learned.

Francis thinks women should [faithfully and obediently remain subservient to men](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_francis#Position_of_women).

**I fully understand why many people consider Francis to be better than Benedict. But Francis still holds many reprehensible views - he is hopelessly conservative, illiberal and theocratic.

I find this wrong and offensive.  

Rape is non-consensual sex.  Of course there is definitely room to debate whether something is sex or not (does being fingered count as sex?  And there is certainly room to debate what exactly qualifies as non-consensual.

But there is no question as to whether penis-in-vagina penetration is sex; everyone agrees that is sex.  And no question about whether there is consent - everyone agrees that being physically forced into sex is non-consensual.

And yet there must be some merit, or at least some justification, to the view that men forced into vaginal sex are not rape victims - otherwise why would the ""system"" agree they aren't?

The main counter argument is that if true Laissez-Faire Capitalism was implemented tomorrow in the United States that 2 or 3 Multi-Nat Corporations would take over everything and we would all burn to the ground under or corporate masters boots. I think this is complete and utter bullshit. The only way (and history is as far as I know completely on my side) a monopoly can form is if the government intervenes and creates corporatist legislation. 

This is a compounding issue. If the government has the ability to create sweeping legislation for corporations and business, they have the ability to be lobbied by successful business' to create legislation specific for that corporations success, thus edging their way further in the market creating a monopoly or a quasi-monopoly.

If you can name a **SINGLE** natural monopoly that has ever formed (read: one without government protectionism or corporatist legislation of any kind) I will completely concede this argument and in fact will likely change my entire perspective on economics as a whole.

The ONLY way a natural monopoly could ever form is if a business undercut the rest of their competition so much that their products became affordable to everyone while at the same time developing such a technological advantage in both R&amp;D and production that the quality and quantity of their goods did not decrease because of their massive cut costs to consumers and had such a massively successful infrastructure and costumer support wing that consumer approval of their company would be at near 100%

And I have to say, if that ever happened, I don't think I'd mind so much.

Monopolies exist in their current form because of corporatist legislation like Limited Liability and Indefinite Duration and the governments obsession of perpetrating things like the Stock Market. They would not exist in a vacuum. They **can not** exist in a vacuum. We need a fair economy. The solution is creating an even playing field for everyone and creating a situation where small business can flourish. 

This also means creating a system where small business can (figuratively) be shut down if they overstep their natural boundaries. The best way to do that is without any legislation at all, in my opinion, as natural competition will outweigh any form of legislation in the long run.

Taxing the people who create small business ($250,000+) does not fix the problem, it actively hurts it. Taxing the people who already have the big business (millionaires/billionaires) does not treat the disease, it only cures one of hundreds of symptoms.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1373906752.0,,,True,t3_1iceuv,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iceuv/i_believe_laissezfaire_capitalism_is_the_ideal/,

I was also appalled by the beliefs of many of the libertarians I came into contact with during that time.

To be a libertarian, you have to value letting people hold onto their money more than you value reducing hunger, poverty, homelessness, sickness, suffering, and untimely death. I don't hold that all libertarians value their *own* money more than they value other people (although certainly some do), but rather that they value the ownership of money in general as more valuable than people.

I often consider the following thought experiment:  

&gt;A child is disabled and on train tracks, and there is an oncoming train. There is a heavy object obstructing John's path to save the child that he cannot lift on his own. There are bystanders who could help, but for whatever reason, not enough are willing to help to successfully move the heavy object. However, John has a gun he can use to coerce the bystanders to help him help save the child.

Any reasonable person, I believe, would use the gun to coerce the people to help. A libertarian would not because such action violates the ""non-aggression principle"".

I'd like to know how someone can both be a libertarian and value people more than money.

I would define a libertarian as someone who would change the current US government more toward smaller government roles, lower taxes than toward larger government roles and higher taxes. So, for instance, someone who wants to get rid of the FDA but also wants to institute universal healthcare I wouldn't really consider libertarian since the latter action would be much more significant than the former.

CMV.",BroseppeVerdi,111,34,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ixvaw/i_think_john_williams_is_an_excellent_composer/,"Let me first preface this by saying that I am speaking especially to those in the classical and/or ""academic"" musical communities, and that I hold this opinion as a 3rd year undergraduate Music Composition major and a former military bandsman. That having been said...

People love to hate on John Williams, and I think it's unjustified. Let me address a few specific gripes people have with JW:

* ""He rips off classical composers!""

I've got news for you: This is what *all* composers do and have always done as far back as written records can demonstrate (standing on the shoulders of giants, and all that...). Copland stole from William Stepp, Chopin stole from John Field, Mozart stole from JC Bach, and Bach from Vivaldi before that... Hell, during the middle ages, people just wrote new parts on the same manuscript as the piece they were stealing from. The greatest musical innovators of each generation steal from their own influences and, at best, make incremental moves towards a new, original sound.

* ""He doesn't do his own orchestration!""

This is actually a common practice among film composers. The reason why is not because the composer is an incompetent orchestrator, but because of the immense amount of work required of film composers and the minimal time they are given to complete their task. It's not unusual for film composers to do their work entirely in post, playing along with a finished copy of the movie with a timecode in the corner of the screen, and they are often charged with writing nearly an hour of orchestral music with what may be as little as 2 weeks. It's not uncommon for a composer to write a piano reduction with instrumental indications and ossia staff scrawled in the margin, and a team of 2-3 orchestrators and maybe a half-dozen uncredited copyists.

* ""His music just sounds too 'cinematic'""

For those of you not familiar with this argument, I'll fill you in: Classical musicians who are proponents of a ""legitimate"" modern classical style tend to shy away from tonality, melody, and traditional harmonic structures in favor of bizarre sounds. They love graphic notation, and will praise any piece of music as long as it's weird. The term is often used to describe very striking neo-romantic type music, martial music, or any music that people feel could be used in a film or video game to evoke a particular emotion or set a particular mood (Curiously, people who enjoy this kind of music don't seem to have a problem with chamber music that includes an electronic or multimedia/visual component.) John Corigliano, for example, is a venerated hero in the academic music community, but people don't like to talk about his score for The Red Violin, even though it kicked ass.

Okay, I'm done running my mouth.

CMV,AnEpiphanyTooLate,117,46,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1igjwd/overpopulation_does_not_exist_and_any_attempts_to/,"Overpopulation, by definition, cannot exist. Every species has a carrying capacity. This capacity has many different variables, but essentially it entails access to resources and a sustainable habitat. When this capacity is exceeded, the excess population dies off and the population remains at a sustainable level compared to the amount of resources. A species cannot go ""over"" this capacity. It is literally impossible because of the definition of the word. You cannot have a population greater than the amount of resources that are available to it. Why would humans be any different? Why would we be the only species able to exceed the carrying capacity?

I think the only reason people are terrified is because they see graphs like [this](http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Population_curve.svg/350px-Population_curve.svg.png&amp;imgrefurl=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population&amp;h=207&amp;w=350&amp;sz=6&amp;tbnid=wZ7rAqJKGO-ROM:&amp;tbnh=71&amp;tbnw=120&amp;zoom=1&amp;usg=__Fia9hekf37zUUn9YszWApu5b_oY=&amp;docid=Rfq_Aji5yK4L7M&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5e7lUdb2CcTuyAGM5YHQCg&amp;ved=0CDQQ9QEwAg&amp;dur=397) and think ""Oh no! Look how much our population has increased in an incredibly short span of time! How will we survive?"" The problem is that, by definition, populations increase exponentially due to the simple mathematical fact that offspring begets offspring. It should be absolutely no surprise that we would go from 1 billion to 2 billion people way faster than from almost no people to 1 billion. It is a fact of nature that populations increase exponentially. We could plot a similar graph from 10,000 B.C. to 1 A.D. and see essentially the same type of graph, just with a smaller total population.

Finally, people in the past have made similar predictions and been way off. Ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle griped about the population being too high. And this was when the population was less than 200 million. Tertullian once said, ""Our numbers are burdensome to the world, which can hardly support us."" Thomas Malthus thought that the food supply would grow at a stable rate. We see now that he was wrong. Food supply has grown along with demand due to new technologies he could not foresee. Paul Ehrlich wrote in 1968 that millions would die in the next decade. It never came to be. To be fair, others have criticized Malthus, Ehrlich, and others, but that is exactly my point. No one can seem to agree on the amount of the carrying capacity. Estimates range from under a billion (which can now obviously be discredited) to over a trillion. UN estimates range from 7.8 billion on the low end to 12.5 billion on the high end. And this is all assuming no more technological advancements are made. I'm not saying that we should automatically hand-wave any estimate of the carrying capacity. All I'm saying is that there are too many variables to calculate to get an accurate answer. We could easily meet our carrying capacity in the next 50 years, or be just fine for the next 1,000.

Now to the practical and moral aspect. By definition, any attempt to curb the population involves a lower birth rate. But how would we implement such a thing? Most people agree that China's one-child policy is immoral, yet this would be the only way to prevent our population from increasing. In addition, the policy only seems to have affected China's sex balance. Their population is still growing due to the underlying fact that it's incredibly difficult to enforce something like this. In recent years, China seems to have grown more relaxed about the policy. We could educate people about family planning, but this only addresses a symptom rather than a root cause. Ultimately, if a family wants to have six kids, nobody is going to (or can(or, in my opinion, should)) stop them. Other than that, no real solutions have been offered. We hear cries of ""We HAVE to control our population or we will meet dire consequences!"" Yet no solution is ever offered as to how we would achieve such a goal. My opinion is because the only ""solutions"" offered are considered immoral by most people (one-child policy) or impractical (education.) They simply save face in the public eye by crying about how overpopulation is bad, yet never giving any sort of solution. Because there are no solutions. It's next to impossible to artificially control a population outside of war, famine, disaster, or genocide. These are the only ""real"" solutions to ""overpopulation"" and they are both immoral and impractical.

In my opinion, we should focus more on providing food and water to the malnourished and starving, which is the underlying theme in this whole debate in the first place. Instead of focusing on numbers, we should be focusing on providing for those who can't survive regardless of the amount of people there are. That's the true tragedy here.

Doing this 4 times in a day uses 6 gallons, or about 28 liters of water a day. This is a huge amount and shouldnt be wasted. It can also save on bills too but only by about £30-40 per year(going by the 4 flushes a day at 2p per flush).

I'm mainly referring to guys, it'll be a bit of a hassle for women.

&gt;Thats disgusting, it'll cause the bathroom and the house to stink!  

When you run the water to quickly wash your hands after, it will wash away any pee that is in the pipes. Just like when you wash dirt off your hands it washes the dirt away, it doesn't sit down the plug hole leaving a smell.

&gt;It's germy, it'll probably spread diseases, eww, i think im gonna puke

Pee is sterile, you cant catch anything from it unless maybe if the person has an infection, im not sure about that. Either way, what i said in the first point about it getting washed away will fix this issue anyway.

&gt;Why not just pee in the toilet but just dont flush it until you need to? you freak.

Well, this WILL cause the place to smell, you just had a go at me for that. It'll just be like having a bowl of pee in the bathroom.

&gt;It's disgusting, you're disgusting!

Thats just a social construct. Just like how i(and most) think eating a Snail is gross but then the French seem to think its fine.

edit: i just want to add that its easier and quicker too. Like you dont need to aim much, you just point straight and you cant miss and hit the seat or anything. You can also pretty much start running the tap as you finish too and go straight to hand washing.

edit 2: Just to give a bit of info on why i first tried this it was because flushing a toilet can be noisey and i dont like flushing in the middle of the night so one night i decided to pee in the sink to avoid waking anybody. So thats another advantage i guess, if you live in a small house with a non quiet toilet then it will eliminate the chance of waking anybody.

edit 3: Where i live sometimes we have hose pipe bans when there are water shortages. This means that you cant wash your car or water your grass in the summer unless you do the whole lawn with a watering can. I think that peeing in the sink would save a loadddd more water than a hose pipe ban since for every 1 time somebody uses a hose pipe, 100 toilets are flushed just because of pee.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1371263241.0,,,True,t3_1gd6do,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1gd6do/i_think_that_peeing_in_the_sink_to_save_water_is/,

1367931531.0,73,self.changemyview,1duxej,The reason we consider Nazism so evil is because they treated westerners the way westerners treated the world. CMV,Wyd,99,26,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1duxej/the_reason_we_consider_nazism_so_evil_is_because/,"Nazism is considered by many in the western world to be one of the most evil ideologies that has ever existed. Their desire to dominate Europe, their eugenics program and the concentration camps have been considered (rightfully so) as crimes against humanity. Now, it is clear to me that the concentration camps, the eugenics program, and their army destroyed countless lives in ways I can't even imagine. 

But did people actually consider the actions themselves evil or did they consider it evil because it happened to westerners? 

When you look at the history of the concentration camps you find they were not invented by the Nazis. Concentration camps were used by the [British](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War#Concentration_camps_.281900.E2.80.931902.29) in South Africa against the Boers and by the [Germans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_Genocide#Concentration_camps) in Namibia. These events are barely mentioned when discussing the topic of concentration camps even though they inspired [the concentration camps in Germany and Poland.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herero_and_Namaqua_genocide#Influence_upon_Nazi_Germany) 

The Nazi eugenics program was inspired by [similar eugenics programs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_eugenics#Origins_in_the_wider_European.2FU.S._eugenics_movement) in America and the rest of Europe. What is particularly telling is that those eugenics programs weren't stopped after the war. In Sweden they continued until [1975](http://www.wsws.org/en/articles/1999/03/euge-19m.html) and America stopped around that [time](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics_in_the_United_States#Compulsory_sterilization).     

Is the desire to dominate Europe any different than the desire for European colonizers to dominate their colonies? Only a couple of years after they were occupied [The Netherlands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_National_Revolution) and [France](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_independence_war) fought bloody independence wars while Britain suppressed uprisings in countries like [Kenya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau_Mau_Uprising) and [Malaysia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayan_Emergency).

Is being evil simply a matter of scale? [Congo free state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_free_state) also killed a lot of people.

I have had my view changed mostly due to these arguments: (1) that grading is different between STEM and non-STEM with maybe a bit more leniency outside the hard sciences (2) My school is far from representative of everywhere despite being a large mid-tier institution and (3) Philosophy is hard when you dig deep enough.

I honestly would like someone to change my view in regard to this because I totally believe that the academic elitist view of many engineers (myself included) is justified based on the difficulty of my classes. I haven't heard much of the same from other STEM majors but I think at this point it's a justified view for them as well. 

Basically, my view boils down to this: After having taken a number of upper-level social science courses as required non-tech electives (some economics, psychology, philosophy), it is my opinion that non-STEM majors (excluding skill-based arts/music) are much easier and in general require less work to get the same grade. If I were to decide to major in a non-STEM major I think I could be just as if not more successful than nearly everyone in these majors if I wanted to pursue one of them instead. I do not think the same can be said of a non-STEM major switching into engineering. They may be able to make it through the introductory courses but upper level undergraduate sequences of classes like heat and mass balances --&gt; fluid transport --&gt; heat and mass transfer I think would prove nearly impossible for the majority.

**Thus, I think I am better than my fellow non-STEM majors academically because I believe I can do everything they can do in addition to being able to do something that they are unable to do.** To me, this is a *very negative* view to possess because I devalue the effort other students. If you can change my view, I would very much appreciate it. I will do my best to reply to all reasonable challenges. Please feel free to ask me for any clarification.

Edit: I do not believe that I am more intelligent or that STEM majors are inherently more intelligent that people in other fields. Many of you have made my conscious of the fact that what I believe stems more from the fact that the mid-level university I attend does not seem to have as strict of requirements for non-STEM majors in regard to coursework as it does for STEM majors. I'm certain there are programs out there with excellent non-STEM programs that I would be in way over my head at.

The main problems that I have with the MPAA:

- Follow a religious (Catholic) ethical model that is not relevant to all film makers/media viwers

- Sexist/Anti-equality (more likely to ask for sex scenes to be cut if showing female pleasure; more likely to ask rape scenes to be cut if victim is male; very low tolerance for gay subject matter/sex and ""deviant sex"" such as 3-somes/orgies or non-missionary position sex)

- No discussion of unrealistic violence/appropriateness of violence

- Language/content ratings control distribution, making any film with content ""not suitable for ~~children~~ anyone under 17 ~~without an adult~~"" virtually impossible to get into theatres...which dumbs down our media

- No alternate, secular review board (monopoly)

Yes, it’s a serious problem and yes it happens far too often. But I hope that can be a separate discussion. I hope we can stick to female-on-male rape and whether it’s a cause for alarm. As I said, I think it’s a minor drop in the sea of overall rapes committed. 

The comments that inspired this post kept pointing out that women can rape men by drugging their drink, blackmailing them into sex, or simply overpowering them. And while, yes, this has likely happened before, it hardly seems like the order of the day. Like I said, CMV. 

Maybe it's just me, but this seems to be coming up a lot on reddit recently. Some seem to wish to change any conversation of rape towards the notion that woman rape just like men do. They constantly point to something called “tumblr feminism”, or SRS – which are apparently things – as trying to cover this up. It seems to have become an argument about who the *real* bad people are.  

More-often-than-not it seems fights between the hardcore feminists and the vehement anti-feminists come across like listening to an argument between Donald Trump and Rosie O’Donnell – in other words, maybe it’s my fault for even tuning in. Or am I wrong, and I’m just ignorant of what a problem female-on-rape is?

The other phenomenon often cited is when a female school teacher has sex with a high school boy. While clearly statutory rape, this seems to me as somewhat trivial compared to when a woman is violently raped by a man. Again, CMV. 

By the way, I’m sure that we can all agree that statistics for such a topic are woefully problematic.  And I certainly know that not having data at hand doesn’t make your contribution invalid. But it would be great if people could mention any studies that have sought to examine this. 

Finally, I just want to say that I am not trying to minimize or turn a blind eye to *any* form of rape. Rape is rape and rape is bad; I think we all know that. I certainly don’t want to suggest that any males who have been a victim to female rape should just “walk it off,” or whatever. Just that they’re in an incredible minority of rape victims, statistically speaking. Mostly, I’m just hoping to learn a thing or two. Thanks.

Of course these are still just my opinions and I hope that by clarifying them I do not change the argument that I presented in the title. There are arguments in the comments that counteract these opinons and, while they have not convinced me, they are all very well thought out and deserve consideration.

Further edits may be required to better clarify my opinion on other matters.

**The Purpose of Exams**: In my mind the purpose of examinations is to rank  people in order of ability. Assuming that performing well under pressure (which is imposed by including a time-limit) is an ability then to allow some people a longer time under these conditions allows for discrepancies in the results i.e. people that got better marks may not actually be better at the task. If the test is not meant to value this ability, yet a time-limit is still imposed for practical reasons, then the time-limit should allow everyone enough time to finish exam and not just people that have a defined mental disability. The only way to be sure this does not then effect the exam is to give everyone the same amount of time, even if it is in excess of what is normally needed to finish the exam.

Some people have challenged this purpose of exams so I would like to draw a brief clarification that I am not talking about classroom tests and what not but things that effect career opportunities and getting into universities. In England this consists of A-levels and GCSEs but I am confident there is a cross-Atlantic equivalent.

**On Mental Disability**: For an example I shall use Dyslexia as I did in the title. Dyslexia is a mental disorder that is characterized by difficulty reading, writing, and/or spelling. However these difficulties are not unique to this disability. By this a mean people who are simply bad or unpracticed at these things are not necessarily Dyslexic. But the results are the same no matter what the reason e.g. you are slower at reading than others. This does not mean that they do not deserve extra help but if we take the ""purpose of exams"" to as I have previously defined then there is no point in understanding the reason someone is bad at the thing being tested (from an examination point of view) simply that they are. This may sound harsh but ranking people based on ability was never going to be polite.

**Time-Limits**: Time-Limits for exams exist for practical purposes, please understand the difference between attacking their existence and my argument.

I also have said numerous times in comments that I would give everyone the same amount of time the Dyslexic people currently (but only for exams that are not testing speed) making sure everyone has enough time to finish the exam.

**Physical Disabilities**: Are not relevant and analogies have repeatedly proved to be ineffective. My refutation of these analogies typically boils down to the fact that a mental disability is permanent while a physical difficulty can be accommodated for in the work place (such as glasses or a text to speak computer program).",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1367799035.0,,points ,True,t3_1dq5nl,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dq5nl/i_dont_believe_people_with_mental_disabilities_eg/,

They don't merely want equal rights for women, they also want women to be treated the same as men socially and culturally. 

I think this is bogus. 

Feminism grew big between the 60s and the 80s, when people strongly believed in the malleability of society and [nurture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurture) was chosen above nature. 

This is false. Modern research has shown that personality and behavior are far more dependent on biology (brain, genes) than previously understood. There are significant differences (in general) between male and female brains. 

[In the past](http://i.imgur.com/pHNHbFA.png), all males had to act masculine and females had to act feminine. Instead of ending gender stereotypes, [feminists have created a new unisex stereotype](http://i.imgur.com/xjCkkRq.png): letting females behave more like males and letting males behave a bit more feminine. 

Both options are wrong and harmful. [In reality](http://i.imgur.com/A5tR8hn.png), many males seem to be predisposed toward masculine behavior (for example aggressiveness and competitiveness), and the same holds true for females and feminine behavior. 

On average, boys just have more testosterone in their bodies. Not all of them are aggressive, and there are aggressive females too, but if you're looking at big groups, there is a significant difference. So if there are more male boxers, criminals, politicians and businessmen than females, that might just be biology, and not 'the patriarchy'. 

The idea that women are exactly the same as men seems to be harmful. Women should be fully equal in political and legal rights, but it's not 'wrong' if a certain group (a job or a community) has more males than females, or vice versa. Some governments try to 'correct' this with quotas, and I think that's harmful.

According to Google and the Merriam-Webster definition, a civilian is:

""one not on active duty in the armed services or not on a police or firefighting force"" 

Under international humanitarian law:

""a person who is not a member of his or her country's armed forces or other militia"" [note, does mention police, but links to the US definition]

For the distinction, those who are not considered civilians have ""may from time to time need additional legal powers over and above those usually available to ordinary citizens.""

Even emergency services (like me when I'm on duty as an EMT) can be recognized as non-civilians while on duty. I think these definitions and examples show how police can operate outside the law with little to no consequence. This does not mean, whatsoever, that there is no oversight in police activity, and that they aren't subjected to laws at all; however, this gives fluidity and grey area in the legal realm when it comes to the police. 

If you have a disagreement with this premise, feel free to address only this part of the CMV.

**Part 2**

Once again, I am not making a blanket statement that all police officers are corrupt and abuse their powers. However, I do believe that this 'Us vs Them' mentality created by the belief that they are above civilians mitigates corruption and the abuse of power.

When I have been a victim of crimes or when I've had family members be victims the police have either been entirely unhelpful or made the situation worse for the victim.  This experience has been uniform in every police interaction I have had myself or known a family member or close friend to have had.  I no longer report crimes to the police unless I have insurance reasons for doing so, I generally would refuse to assist the police or tell them anything, and frankly I look down on people in the profession.

Broadly speaking I don't think that the police, as police, offer much protection or redress.  While I acknowledge that were I to get in a car accident and an officer was the first responder they would render me badly needed aid I don't think that matters much because any trained responder would do the same and that isn't the primary job of police anyways.  To make my point about the uselessness of the police I'm going to break down three common kinds of crimes I might be a victim of and relate experiences I've had or known people to have that make me believe I should not go to the police.

**Property Crimes**

This is my biggest complaint, it is the kind of crime one is most likely to encounter and I've never seen the police make even the most basic effort at prosecuting these crimes.  Several years ago a somewhat unstable girl was feuding with one of my roommates over an ex boyfriend.  She entered our house through an unlocked back door (she knew the house), vandalized my friend's room for damages &gt;$500, and was seen by another roommate exiting the front door as she left.  When the vandalism was discovered we called the police, they came, were told the story, spoke to the person who saw the guilty party leaving, and received a current address for the vandal's whereabouts.  Later the guilty party posted on facebook that her roommate said the police were looking for her-- she thought it was hilarious.  We followed up with the police, as did our landlord (most of the damage was to the room itself), but to the best of my knowledge they made no further effort and I am certain that there were no consequences to the vandal.

This is the most egregious experience I've had, but I have never known police to seriously investigate property crimes.  My mom had her car twice broken into in a public park's lot, as did many other people, but nothing was done.  The people who broke into her card attempted to use her ATM card to pay ""Graduation Fees"" at a local high school-- my mom attempted to get the police to investigate further but they were unwilling to do so.

So unless I need to deal with an insurance company why the hell would I go to the police if someone steals or damages my property?

**Sexual Crimes**

I have a family member who was sexually assaulted.  Not a 'stranger in an ally situation', I understand those to be extremely rare, but a person at a party who my family member hardly knew.  He got her out of the common areas of the party and then forcibly assaulted her.  She went to the police and had a bad experience doing so.  They were unconcerned with her welfare or mental state.  They went to great efforts to get her to say she either knew the guy better than she did or had drank much more than she had.  The whole orientation of the police's process was not towards proving a crime, or apprehending an offender, but instead trying to create doubt that a crime had occurred.  In the end they did nothing other than compound the trauma of the rape.  The victim regrets having gone to the police.  I entirely believe her story on the basis of long observation of her personal stability and the clear effect this had on her in the aftermath; please don't try and tell me that if it really was as she represented the police would have done more.  

If I am ever the victim of a sexual assault, thankfully unlikely, I certainly won't bring it to the attention of police.

**Violent Crimes**

I have never been a victim of a serious assault or attempted murder and the only people I know who have are the kind who 'don't snitch' no matter what happened.  So I admit a lack of direct experience here and expect police take such things somewhat more seriously.  Still, I don't think I or most people face a significant chance of being assaulted except from someone close to them or strangers mostly when I had some role in escalating the altercation.  Most people won't report a family member/SO unless the injury is really serious and if some total stranger decides to jump me and beat me totally unprovoked I think my chances of reliably identifying that person for police are basically 0.  So again in this regard I don't think the police provide significant protection; they'll take your husband away in cuffs after he stabs you, but that's about it.

**Don't try and tell me that the police don't have enough resources to investigate these kinds of crimes.**

In the vandalism case $500-$1000 worth of damage was done.  I know how many hoops the police would jump through to bust a $1000 coke deal, shit a $50 coke deal.  The police have resources, but their priorities are not oriented towards the welfare of citizens and protecting those citizens from crime.  I could go into my analysis of the real role of these police, but that's well beyond the scope of this CMV, so all I'll do is name check Michelle Alexander's [landmark work](http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-jim-crow-mass-incarceration-in-the-age-of-colorblindness/oclc/320803432&amp;referer=brief_results)",,False,,t5_2w2s8,False,,points ,True,t3_1hy90g,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hy90g/i_do_not_believe_that_police_in_the_united_states/,

***A tax break for churches forces all American taxpayers to support religion***, even if they oppose some or all religious doctrines. As Mark Twain argued: ""no church property is taxed and so the infidel and the atheist and the man without religion are taxed to make up the deficit in the public income thus caused.""


***A tax exemption is a form of subsidy, and the Constitution bars government from subsidizing religion.*** William H. Rehnquist, then-Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court, declared on behalf of a unanimous court in Regan v. Taxation with Representation (1983): ""Both tax exemptions and tax deductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system. A tax exemption has much the same effect as a cash grant to the organization of the amount of tax it would have to pay on its income.""
The tax code makes no distinction between authentic religions and fraudulent startup ""faiths,"" which benefit at taxpayers' expense. In spring 2010, Oklahoma awarded tax exempt status to Satanist group The Church of the IV Majesties. In Mar. 2004, the IRS warned of an increase in schemes that ""exploit legitimate laws to establish sham one-person, nonprofit religious corporations"" charging $1,000 or more per person to attend ""seminars."" The Church of Scientology, which TIME Magazine described in May 1991 as a ""thriving cult of greed and power"" and ""a hugely profitable global racket,"" was granted federal income tax exemption in Oct. 1993. The New York Times reported that this ""saved the church tens of millions of dollars in taxes.""


***Churches serve a religious purpose that does not aid the government***, so their tax exemptions are not justified. Tax exemptions to secular nonprofits like hospitals and homeless shelters are justified because such organizations do work that would otherwise fall to government. Churches, while they may undertake charitable work, exist primarily for religious worship and instruction, which the US government is constitutionally prevented from performing.


***Exempting churches from taxation costs the government billions of dollars in lost revenue***, which it cannot afford, especially in tough economic times. According to former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer, PhD, US churches own $300-$500 billion in untaxed property. New York's nonpartisan Independent Budget Office determined in July 2011 that New York City alone loses $627 million in property tax revenue. Lakewood Church, a ""megachurch"" in Houston, TX, earns $75 million in annual untaxed revenue, and the Church of Scientology's annual income exceeds $500 million.


***Despite the 1954 law banning political campaigning by tax-exempt groups, many churches are clearly political and therefore should not be receiving tax exemptions***. Every fall, the Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian legal group, organizes ""Pulpit Freedom Sunday,"" encouraging pastors to defy IRS rules by endorsing candidates from the pulpit. More than 500 pastors participated in Oct. 2011, yet none lost their churches' exemption status. In Oct. 2010, Minnesota pastor Brad Brandon of Berean Bible Baptist Church endorsed several Republican candidates and dared the ""liberal media"" to file complaints with the IRS. Brandon later announced on his radio program: ""I'm going to explain to you what happened… Nothing happened.""


***American taxpayers are supporting the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy pastors, whose lavish ""megachurches"" accumulate millions of tax-free dollars every year.*** US Senator Chuck Grassley, MA (R-IA) launched an investigation into these groups in Nov. 2007 after receiving complaints of church revenue being used to buy pastors private jets, Rolls Royce cars, multimillion-dollar homes, trips to Hawaii and Fiji, and in one case, a $23,000, marble-topped chest of drawers installed in the 150,000 square foot headquarters of Joyce Meyer Ministries in Fenton, Missouri.


***The tax break given to churches restricts their freedom of speech because it deters pastors from speaking out for or against political candidates.*** As argued by Rev. Carl Gregg, pastor of Maryland's Broadview Church, ""when Christians speak, we shouldn't have to worry about whether we are biting the hand that feeds us because we shouldn't be fed from Caesar/Uncle Sam in the first place.""


***The ""parsonage exemption"" on ministers' homes makes already-wealthy pastors even richer at taxpayers' expense.*** The average annual salary for senior pastors with congregations of 2,000 or more is $147,000, with some earning up to $400,000. In addition to the federal exemption on housing expenses enjoyed by these ministers, they often pay zero dollars in state property tax. Church leaders Creflo and Taffi Dollar of World Changers Church International had three tax-free parsonages: a million-dollar mansion in Atlanta, GA, a two-million-dollar mansion in Fayetteville, GA, and a $2.5 million Manhattan apartment. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, leaders of Kenneth Copeland Ministries in Fort Worth, TX, live in a church-owned, tax-free $6.2 million lakefront parsonage.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1372228230.0,,,True,t3_1h3c23,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h3c23/i_believe_that_churches_should_be_subject_to/,
1370709402.0,68,self.changemyview,1fxkk0,I believe that just like we have licenses for driving there should be a license for having a child. CMV,ccxxv,114,46,242,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fxkk0/i_believe_that_just_like_we_have_licenses_for/,"Let's face it. Humanity is broadening the gap between them and the rest of the animal kingdom. We are on the top of the food chain and there are over 7 billion of us: reproduction is not about survival anymore. There are way too many of us for children to just be spouting out of their moms vaginas every 5 seconds.

If we require licenses for things such as driving a vehicle or being a practicing doctor, why don't we require it for raising a human being?

I don't believe reproduction/conception is a miracle. If anything, it's the phenomenon furthest away from a miracle: it happens every day in every part of the world, and can be done by every single living thing - AND we know how it all works.
Birth is no miracle. Birth is the most common behavior amongst all living things. 

We live in a world where we put laws and regulations on every day life. So if a life of a human being is SO important, why are we just making them by the bucketful?

Many are unwanted. Many cannot be raised in the social-economic status they were born in. Many are mistreated, permanently scarred mentally and physically, or even die because certain people are just not fit to be good parents in the modern day world.
So why are we letting new life be born into a world that will not be adequate for them?

If the government is going to put a restriction on what plants I can or cannot set on fire, or where and where not it's appropriate for me to open a beer, OR WHETHER IT'S LEGAL OR NOT TO WALK AS MOTHER NATURE PUT ME IN THIS PLANET AND BE NAKED, I think they have all the right to put a regulation on whether or not I'm fit to have a child that will grow with adequate resources and shelter, good education, morals, love, etc.


If licenses were required, all children would be born in what would be an almost perfect scenario for them to grow healthy and have a successful future. Not only this, but licensing birth would also hav ea huge impact on third world countries. World poverty could become manageable. Diseases could be controlled. There would be no adoption centers. Every child would have a wonderful upbringing - which in turn means wonderful lives as adults.


In all honesty, I think if we ever want to make any solid advances as an ""intelligent species"", one of the first things we gotta change is  that just because you can make a baby doesn't mean you're fit to be a parent.



EDIT: Consequences would be to terminate the life of the baby either during pregnancy (if detected during) or right at birth. Maybe the age cap would be 1 or 2 years old in the case of a hiding mother. This procedure could be law in hospitals.
Poor countries where birth often occurs at home and not in hospitals: Well, that would be hard to work around with. But it can be done.
Just look at the one-child policy in China. 


EDIT 2:  YES IT WILL BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL. YES IT WILL MOSTLY HAPPEN UNDER TOTALITARIAN GOVERNMENTS. I SEE NO PROBLEM IN THIS SINCE IT'S LOOKING OUT FOR NEW LIFE.



EDIT 3: I really enjoy all the arguments that go for freedom of one's body or those that go against more government regulation. But I truly believe these are all in favor of the parents, not the child. I'm trying to picture a world in which every child grows in above average conditions (mentally and physically... not necessarily economically), but all I get back is people fighting for whatever mothers want. I don't think we should be focusing on what is better for the parents, but what is better for the new life.


EDIT 4: I am learning a lot from you guys, but I've yet to be even slightly convinced otherwise. Thank you to those who quote sources and refute with hard-on facts. I didn't create this thread to be an asshole whose mind cannot be changed. I like to learn.


EDIT 5: now opinions are starting to get like ""you're sick and killing babies is WRAWNG."" yes well would you tell me why you hold this view? it would be easier to reply to you and have a debate that way.


EDIT6: I try not to call this eugenics since I'm not choosing on basis of genetics. But rather mental health and availability to provide resources.

I completely support gay rights in every conceivable way.  I just don't agree with this particular claim about psychology.

I readily accept that *some* people are ""a little bit gay.""  I'm not contesting the ""sexuality is a scale"" interpretation in which someone can be predominantly straight or predominantly gay and still harbor some attraction to the remaining gender. What I challenge is the suggestion that *everyone* secretly harbors such feelings.  I think some people are simply straight (and, as a corollary, some people are simply gay) and that neither group is necessarily ""suppressing"" their bisexuality.

Now, I did add the caveat that I don't believe this is true in a *meaningful* way, and I'll attempt to explain what I mean.  For simplicity's sake I'll assume for the purposes of this example that you're a heterosexual male, but feel free to substitute whatever gender actors you prefer.

Consider a silhouette in the moonlight.  At the end of a foggy pier, you spot a shapely woman gazing off over the still lake.  She's attractive by your standards, standing there in the distance, and though you can't make out the details, and your heart flutters as you approach.  However, as you draw near, you discover that it is not a woman at all, but a crude statue of a woman.  The fog fooled you, and in the distance the indistinct shape that caused your heart to flutter looked real enough, but upon closer inspection it's just a hunk of stone, cold and rough and lifeless.  Oh well.

Does this mean you are ""a little bit attracted to stones?""  Clearly not.  Your heart did flutter, but it fluttered at the thought of the woman you imagined, not at the reality of the stone.  You were attracted exclusively to the womanly features of the stone, not to the stone-like features, which were hidden by the fog.  The stone always *had* stone-like features, of course, but those were never the source of your attraction.  You were attracted to the statue insofar as it resembled a woman, and no further.  You are in no way meaningfully attracted to rocks.

I would argue the same is true of the tricks people use to prove the point I'm posting this CMV about.   When people post a picture of an armpit (reddit reference alert!) that looks like a vagina, the people who are attracted to it are not ""a little bit attracted to armpits, "" they were simply tricked.  Likewise with other such trick photos.  It may be possible to dress a man convincingly as a woman, but fooling someone in this way does not prove they are attracted to men, if the source of their attraction was the apparent female traits.  To be genuinely ""a little bit attracted to men,"" one would have to find a man attractive *for his masculine qualities,* not for those ways he is made to resemble a woman.

In short, my contention is that not all people are a little bit attracted to their own sex, *not* that the eye cannot be tricked, fooled, or bamboozled into seeing their preferred shapes in unattractive objects.

CMV",boredomreigns,103,34,133,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iuasi/i_believe_that_a_mandatory_minimum_wage_hurts/,"I believe that setting a mandatory minimum wage provides employers with a peg point at which to pay employees, resulting in lower wages than would otherwise be possible in an unrestricted environment.

I think of it like this: In a free marketplace, employers hire employees at a rate for which they will work. In the current system, employers don't have to calculate this rate, they just have a standard minimum rate at which they pay their employees. For an individual firm, this is not a problem. However, the current marketplace we're talking about has multiple firms, and all those firms pay the same starting wage. The result of this is a monopoly-like scenario in which competition is virtually impossible because all employers have a guaranteed peg point at which they can assign wages, that all unskilled workers will have to accept because of the existence of a ""minimum wage"" law. In the long run, the inability of the legislature to update the minimum wage to keep pace with changes in the consumer price index makes the wages of unskilled laborers stagnate. This is great for employers, because in the long run they effectively pay less real value for the same labor they got before, and employees are virtually guaranteed to accept those wages solely because of the existence of a ""minimum"" that they believe is all that they are entitled to in a starting position. 

I believe that an unrestricted wage system would be better, because then employers would have to compete for workers, and the existence of antitrust laws means that they wouldn't legally be able to collaborate to pay employees a fixed wage(similar to the system we have now). Seeing as the current minimum wage is seen as inadequate, the removal of this peg point would place upward pressure on wages until they reached a point that both employers and employees were willing to accept. 

All right, I've never seen this particular viewpoint articulated before, so I'm thinking there might be something wrong with my analysis. CMV

Everybody is born either male or female, and this is your sex, but whether you are a man or a woman is a an issue of identity, and is independent of your sex. 

That is, one can be born a male, but later on in her life, realize that she identifies with women and women traits, and thus decide to identify as a woman. She would request to be referred to by feminine pronouns, start wearing girl clothes, practice changing her voice until it sounded feminine, may or may not get genital/chest surgery and/or hormones, and then, she would be a girl, and do girl things.

Here is where I have the problem. What are ""Girl traits""? What are ""Girl things""? 

I have always considered myself to be an advocate of equality and non-discrimination. I dislike stereotypes of all kind and think that everyone should be treated equally regardless of factors outside of their control such as race, orientation, etc., and as such, **I don't consider any trait to be distinctly masculine or distinctly feminine**. And I think the concept of gender identity promotes the idea that certain traits are.

When did we decide what traits are? What is it that makes a male decide that she is a girl? Or a boy for that matter? What, if you're...sensitive or something, then you're a girl? I'm a pretty sensitive guy! And I can tell you, there's ALL SORTS of things that I do that other people would consider ""Girly"". But the thing is, I think people are full of bullshit. I mean, I don't really *care*. If people were to start referring to me by feminine pronouns, I would be pretty indifferent and probably wouldn't correct them. 

It's just, I don't get it. To me, assigning certain traits to a gender, and saying that identifying with these traits means identifying with that gender seems...backwards. It seems to promote gender stereotypes and roles. Like, if you're a male but you identify as a girl and decide to wear dresses...well, wearing dresses doesn't really help you identify as a girl, does it? All you need to be a girl is to identify as a girl. All wearing a dress is is conforming to how society says a girl should look. That's not about how you perceive yourself, it's about how you want society to perceive *you*.

I think that we should start telling teens about who and where the drugs come from, and how the money that funds these criminal organizations result in the exploitation and harm of innocent people. These lessons should probably be visceral for maximum impact.

1373824009.0,63,self.changemyview,1iaaja,Abortion: I don't believe you can harm someone by failing to cause them to exist CMV.,lowen90,90,27,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iaaja/abortion_i_dont_believe_you_can_harm_someone_by/,"I decided to post this in response to recent threads, political votes, and discussions concerning abortion and the extreme range of opinions. I've already made up my own mind regarding the science and ethical implications such as zygotes and a woman's right to choose etc., and have arrived at those ideas following extensive discussion, debates, and empirical research, but what I wanted to explore further, was the **philosophical dimensions of the abortion debate**. I remember reading a very insightful article a while back which touched on this issue, and a recent sentiment's I have been seeing, particularly 'as the child, I don't want someone making that decision for me' has sparked these thoughts again. I have at least on two occasions been confronted with the question, **'What if your mother had aborted you?'**.

I couldn't respond immediately at the time, because it's difficult to retaliate against an argument removed from the realm of facts. It's an effective tactic admittedly, because emotions do matter and the line invariably forces me to retroactively argue against my own existence. Personally, it also hits home because I was unplanned and our family doctor had recommended to my mother that I be terminated. But here I am, and it's hard not to feel grateful for the decision my mother made. It's easy to simply say, 'I am a complete person, but so is my mother, and she was here first. Her womb, her rules.' and leave it there, but I feel dirty, knowing that somewhere, someone is throwing out this line with the most smack-worthy grin painted on their face (I believe my entire existence is dedicated to destroying these people).

**So what if my mother had aborted me?**

* **To see this as an unethical or immoral course of action, you would have to treat non-life as a kind of transitive property**, while it opens up the possibility of existence, you'd also be forced to consider the variables which nullify that potential. As the title states, I don't believe you can harm someone by failing to cause them exist. My parents were refugees from the Vietnam war, and had fled to Australia where I was conceived and born ten years later. It would be asinine of me to say had conscientious objectors and war protestors had their way, I would not be born - while technically true, no logical person makes decisions in respect to infinite possibilities, which is where we all sprung from. To inverse the logic, I also don't think Henry Kissinger should be lauded for his role in extending the war so refugee babies could be born. Had I not existed, who would know what to blame?
* **There is no psychological continuity between myself and the fetus, that once shared a physical body**. When I say I was not a fetus, I don't mean that in a scientific sense, I wasn't congealed in a gutter. The person I am now, and the person I could be in five minutes from now, or a year or ten years, will be the same person because we will share a stream of consciousness. Because the fetus does not have the capacity for this complex cognitive process, had I been terminated in womb, I don't believe any connection would have been severed. In a sense, it's a bit like reverse-dying; you can't suffer in death, so I don't believe you can be angry or sad for not existing.
* **I believe that if the choice the mother makes determines whether or not you exist**. Had I been aborted, even if I was given a name and a plan, ending my potential for life would be of no more harmful than killing an imaginary person (of course the decision to do so, is often a difficult one). I believe person-hood is granted when the mother decides you can exist, this sounds impersonal on some level, but it's the same reason an aborted fetus is not given a funeral but a miscarriage often is. I suppose this is contentious, because pro-life advocates consider the fetus, even at its earliest stages, to be alive; however, if you put that POV aside, you're only a concept.

So those are the crux of my arguments, I was using abortion mainly as a framework for this idea and because it relates to me personally, so if there is another paradigm you wish to discuss this in, please feel free to.

**NOTICE**: I'm back now, thanks for the posts everyone. I'll be going through them, although I'm already noticing a pattern of answers, so I'll provide macro response in the OP when I can. Just to clarify first before I delve into the comments - up until at least 7 weeks the embryo doesn't have a head, and depending on who you ask, the organism inside the fetus isn't self-functioning until about 19-24 weeks; while I understand people view the organism as life from conception an on onwards, or don't make a distinction between that bundle of nerves and self-functioning organism, it's a bit difficult to respond to you while you hold that view. That's not your fault of course, and I will certainly try to respond, but please don't accuse me of 'mental gymnastics' or 'self-denial' simply because I don't see it the way you do and then leave it as that.

Also, slight edits to make it easier to read.

----
I'm adding this, just because I want to. It's not a main point, and no one is obliged to address it.

Personally I disagree with the pro-life advocates mainly because it has a higher regard for the vague and uncertain notion of the unborn child, over the very unambiguous, very certain notion of the mother. At their best, they argue that 'all life is precious' and it is worth protecting at all cost, because there is no difference between the unborn child and a newborn. But life is a miracle, because we are here, in spite of the impossibility of a universe which has pitiless indifference towards our well-being, not because we *can* exist. Those who are here, have far more precedence than those who could be.

I believe that the right of the people to bear arms won't be infringed if there were background checks . It wouldn't stop the people from owning guns. It may not totally rule out the risk for horrible events like Columbine massacre or Virginia tech shootout or the Colorado shooting, but I believe that it would have definitely reduced the risk for such an occurrence.Also if driving requires a licence test , and people don't mind that , why would owning something as dangerous as a gun, which could possibly take someone's life , not require a background check is something I fail to understand.

Some people argue that it would have helped if more people had guns to counter the psychos. But that argument just leads to a wild west scenario.

Humanity has the capability to automate almost all of our needs for a comfortable life. The few things that we cannot automate seem to be only *just* out of our reach and could be developed if given the necessary resources. Yet therein lies the problem.

Money, by its very nature, encourages greed and inefficiency. There was a time when currency was the most efficient method to encourage people to exchange goods and services, but with the advent of computers and robotics, this is no longer the case. People and corporations *know* that technology and science are the driving forces behind human advancement, yet because all advancement requires the replacement of old practices, the people and corporations who stand to lose their personal investments fight tooth and nail to slow down that human advancement (See: Tesla [both the man and the car], oil and energy, scientific funding of all kinds, etc.).

To my mind, the type of society humanity should be transitioning to is something similar to what organizations like The Venus Project ( http://www.thevenusproject.com/ ) and the Ubuntu Liberation Movement ( http://www.ubuntuparty.org.za/p/home.html ) suggest.

Yet I realize that the shift I'm speaking of is unlikely to happen anytime soon and it is for that reason that I'm here.

The anti-abortion movement runs it's whole platform on the belief that at the moment of conception, a unique person is created and must be protected. That an abortion is the equivalent of murder. It strikes me as hypocritical that ""murder"" is suddenly justifiable when this ""unique person"" is created via rape. To me it shows that pro-lifers who support rape exceptions actually have a, maybe subconscious, issue with consensual sex without the purpose of reproduction. It also tells me that they believe that female-bodied individuals deserve to be punished for consensual sex, whereas those who have non-consensual sex don't.

- Do you go off the victims word alone? Then a lot of people would just lie.
- A report? Now there would be an influx of false reports, and a shockingly large number of rapes aren't reported anyway for understandable reasons.
- A doctor's exam that shows rape happened? Some rape can leave no damage and look like consensual sex.
- An arrest or conviction? IIRC, only about 12% of rapists are arrested, and only 5% will receive a conviction. By that time, the abortion will either be very late or the baby will be born. What about those who don't know their attacker as well?

By claiming the statistical likelihood of a vote in a general presidential election as their reasons, these people claim they don't vote because it is not worth their time.  

I believe this to be a reflection of today's generation of young (15-35) American's self-view.  We are spoiled and has an inflated view of our self worth.  We see ourselves as so important that somehow, ""not being the only thing that matters"" became a reason to not do something.  This generation doesn't understand what team work means.  

To use some analogies for how ridiculous the ""if my vote can't be the deciding vote, I am not going to vote"" reasoning is:

1.  For a football player at the Superbowl to sit out the game because ""the likelihood of me being the guy who makes the game winning play is too low.""

2.  For a construction worker working on the Empire State Building to not work because ""the likelihood of me being the guy who lays the brick that finishes the building is too low.""

3.  For a US soldier during WW2 to sit out the war because ""the likelihood of me being the guy who shoots Hitler in the face and wins the war is too low.""

4.  For civil right activist during the civil right movement to give up because ""the likelihood of my action being the one thing that changes American is too low.""

5.  For every hero who ran into the collapsing building on Sept 11 to turn around because ""the likelihood of me saving everyone is too low.""

6.  For everyone who has ever worked in a team to achieve a greater goal to give up because ""the likelihood of me being the only difference maker is too low.""

When did making 0.000000001% incremental improvement to the greater good of the society became a thing that is ""not worth your time?""

Some will inevitable offer that they can influence more people by spending their time convincing people to change their votes then to vote themselves.  If you are someone who is truly out there so busy campaigning that you didn't have time to vote?  That every minute of your life is dedicated to your cause?  Then good for you.  That is a legitimate reason not to vote.   

I suspect 99/100 people who uses this as their defense doesn't do that.  They simply tries to use it as a logical defense to their selfishness.  I don't know any one who dedicate their lives to a cause who couldn't spare the 15 minutes needed to added that extra vote to their cause.

I suspect most of these non-voters simply believes that voting is for ""those other people who are too dumb/stupid/non-important/expandable to waste their time.""

TLDR:  Americans who claim they don't vote due to the low probability of their vote being the deciding vote are irrational and selfish because they think making 0.000000001% incremental improvement to the greater good of the society is a thing that is ""not worth their time.""

Update:   To explain the irrationality:

Candidate A had 100 votes. Candidate B had 200 votes.

For Candidate B, there were 101 deciding votes and 99 zero-value votes.

Which would means that if you voted for B, the likelihood that your vote was ""zero value"" is 50%. Not 1/200.

Every election is decided by 1 vote. Everything after that is the zero-value votes.

Some how we think all 199 votes were zero value, and that only the one vote that pushed B from 100 to 101 has value.

Obama is *definitely* not a socialist and that a little more socialism in the U.S. will help our country prosper.

In addition to the socialized institutions we have now: police, fire department, public schools, postal service, etc.  we should also have socialized health care, higher education, and utility services that everyone depends on like electricity, natural gas, and water.

I have heard interviews that expanding the Medicaid program for more families to be eligible to 'buy in' would be much cheaper than the 'Obamacare' bill as it stands now.  New York already had a similar program in place with Family Health Plus and Child Care Plus, but I think broadening the income eligibility would be a great solution, even if buyers had to pay the full premium. I had to pay the full premium as part of a child support order ($78/week) and would gladly pay that for myself or other members of my family.

Some communities already have co-ops (publicly owned utilities) that are much more reasonable in price than private or corporate-owned utilities.  I have yet to find someone in the service area of a co-op complain about their service.  The city I live in sold their publicly-owned (municipal) water company to a private entity.  No change in service, yet the cost of water and sewer service has literally tripled since the change.  I think these are essential to public well-being and should not be monopolized by a for-profit corporation.

The only compelling argument against this I have heard so far is that private corporations will spend more money on R&amp;D and innovative technologies.  I think advancements and new technology will still happen in the universities, grant-funded research, and so on.

Not paying profit margins for these things would give people more liquid assets to spend elsewhere, which in turn would benefit privately owned companies in the long run, just in other places, and ultimately stimulate the economy into a boom.

The point I keep hearing is that all problems come back to price manipulation in one way or another.  ""The government interfered, artificially inflating..."" and so on.  

I don't see how a private entity hoarding resources (money) isn't price manipulation.  

* I've heard the argument that you eventually have to stop hoarding to buy stuff that you need, but that only ensures a trickle.  If you love money (resources) more than good food, you can save $10 and spend $1.

* Allowing “some” inflation, as I understand it, is price manipulation and not a free market.  I’m not sure “some” inflation is even a barrier as investment vehicles keep up with inflation.

* I've heard that hoarding money doesn't hurt the economy and everything still works regardless, the values just shift.  But if that's true, that's just acknowledging that you can manipulate over time.

Here’s my analogy: Let's picture a small island with a few thousand people.  They use a commodity standard so that money approximately matches resources, is finite, and government isn't assigning any monetary values.  Let's call this time ""A"".  Then, one guy comes along who is good with the free market and very committed, hard working, etc.  He loves nothing more than to own more money and resources, a money hoarder.

He piles up 10% of the money on the island before anyone notices through diligent saving (or hoarding, depending on your perspective) and sacrificing anything but basic needs.  Eventually, 10% of the money is out of circulation, so the price of everything falls by 10%.  Nobody cares because all prices fell together.  Let's call this time ""B"".  However, one person is different.  Our beloved hoarder can now buy goods using his stockpile at 90% its previous price.  This makes collecting more even easier, and eventually 10% becomes 20% becomes 90%.  

He can control prices over time.  Price manipulation, by a private individual.  He has power of coercion over other individuals granted to him entirely through the free market.  

Finally, to relate to our world: Consider that most wealthy individuals keep only a tiny fraction of their wealth ""liquid"" and a slightly larger fraction ""semi-liquid"".  

**Edit**: I'm not precluding investing as part of the hoarding, but I was trying to keep it simple.

CMV,Vanilla_Onion,85,24,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g1u1m/i_think_peoples_offspring_should_be_limited_and/,"**On limiting the number of children for a couple of generations:**

Our planet is crunching under the enormous stress that humanity inflicts. It would be better to lay off the economic growth for a bit, tough out the  recess and settle down in a more modest and responsible way. Yes we will have an abundancy of old people for a while, but that's not a problem that can't be overcome, with Social Service for example (as opposed to Military Service which used to be common only a short while ago)

**On the licence:**

People need to apply for a licence to drive a car, to own a gun, to drink alcohol, to fish in a river, to cut down a tree, to come live in a country. Now I understand the need to regulate behavior that can impact other people's lives, so I think we should definitely regulate the behavior that can impact most strongly someone else's life: parenthood. The parent is commonly the most infulential factor for a child's world, but independent of mental &amp; social fitness and the ability to economically sustain a child anyone can have as many kids as they like.

It's obviously hard to decide who is fit to have a kid and who is not, but the least we could settle on is an obligatory child-raising seminar to educate people on proper upbringing procedures. This seminar could have an excluding test in the end to make sure people absorb the knowledge. Illegal offspring will be given up for adoption.

Let's see what comes up that could CMV!

Also, I'm aware of the single-child policy that China sustained, which led to some atrocious situations. However this seems mainly related to the tradition of bridal treasure and importance people attach to their lineage, two factors that should not play any significant role in western society. I'm not very big on the subject though, so please correct me.

**edit**
I have read every single comment, and answered as many as I could. The whole process has refined my view considerably, there has been a lot of great input, especially on the side of alternatives to bring back population growth, and insight in the actual problem.

Most people seem to invalidate my argument by the lack of practical solution to execute and enforce it. But when something is practically hard, it doesn't mean that it's morally wrong.

I'm seeing a lot of disagreement about exactly how much stress is put on our planet by the massive population, and about wether the population is actually going to regulate itself or if it will keep growing. Personally I am a bit shocked that there is so much denial about the harm that we do to this planet, and the potential danger that we face. But I guess, since there is no definite scientific consensus (just like with global warming), there is no definite answer. My attitude is to be on the safe side and aim for a modest unimposing humanity on the long term, while some of you seem to want to take the jolly ride and see where it ends. This makes me very sad.

Finally, about the licence: a lot of people have pointed out that this also is hard to regulate. Despite the practical problems, I think it is very important to be able to protect a potential newborn against a harmful environment. Right now society values more strongly the freedom of all to have a kid, then the kid's protection. I stand by my view that society needs tools to protect newborns before the harm is done, because we have to be on the side of the innocent &amp; defenseless and not on that of the knowing and able.

Someone said: some of the most abused kids have grown up to be wonderful people. Maybe, but even if all of them grew up to be fantastic contributors to society, I wouldn't wish a damaging childhood upon anyone.

CMV,lmatt34,84,19,393,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jiqci/i_believe_that_capitalism_is_the_most_universally/,"I believe that capitalism has the power to do the most good for the most number of people.

To keep this discussion centered, here is the definition we'll use for capitalism, per Wikipedia: **Capitalism** is an economic system in which capital assets are privately owned and items are brought to market for profit. In a capitalist economy, the parties to a transaction determine the prices at which assets, goods, and services are exchanged.

I want to define quickly what I **don't** consider to be capitalism and which I am *not* arguing in favor of: Crony capitalism: A description of capitalist society as being based on the close relationships between businessmen and the state. Instead of success being determined by a free market and the rule of law, the success of a business is dependent on the favoritism that is shown to it by the ruling government in the form of tax breaks, government grants and other incentives. (i.e. the Koch brothers)


Three key features of capitalism:
 
**Effeciency** 

- Efficient allocation of resources: In a market system, firms have incentives to be productively efficient – cutting costs to improve competitiveness and productivity. If firms don’t remain productive and efficient they will go out of business.

- Efficient production: In a market system, firms have incentives to be productively efficient – cutting costs to improve competitiveness and productivity. If firms don’t remain productive and efficient they will go out of business.
	
- Dynamic Efficiency: This is efficiency over time. Firms in a capitalist system need to respond to changes in consumer preferences and respond to new consumer trends.
	

**Incentives**

- Evidence suggests that people work hardest when there is a personal financial incentive. E.g. entrepreneurs only take risks in setting up businesses because of the potential for large financial reward. If this scope for private profit is absent then new firms won’t be set up.
	
**Competition**

- A market system helps produce products most in tune with consumer's needs and equalize prices because a business will go of business if it does not create products that consumers want and at prices they are willing to pay.

http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1259/economics/advantages-of-capitalism/


Here are some of my rebuttals to arguments that are likely to be raised:
	

* **Capitalism does not lead to greed.** Greed is a product of human nature, not of any one economic system. Any economy regardless of whether it's capitalistic, socialist, communist, or some combination thereof, will manifest greed amongst some people.

* **Capitalism is not a zero-sum game.** For someone to win, it does not require someone else to lose. It is easy to observe a person who has done well and assume that there must be persons elsewhere who had to lose something in order for this person to have gained. That is true of every political system and many simulated scenarios like sporting events, but nothing could be further from the truth in a market.

	
* **When exchange takes place in a free market, both parties trade something they want less for something they want more.** Of course, either may change their mind later and regret the decision, but at the time of the trade both parties valued what they got more than what they gave, otherwise they would not have traded. It is easy to see how value is created on both sides (because economic value is subjective), and how there was no ""loser."" Beyond this simple illustration, over the long run the wealth generation of capitalist trade grows the overall pool of valuable resources and increases choice for all involved. This means the potential for more and bigger ""wins"" as time goes on and specialization and trade increase. Wealth is created, not distributed.
* **Capitalism is not for the rich.** If there's any class or group that benefits more from capitalism than any other, it's not the rich, but the consumer. Of course all of us, rich and poor alike, play the part of the consumer at various times. But it is an inescapable fact that in order to succeed in a market, you must create value for consumers. Ludwig von Mises sums this up nicely: ""The riches of the rich are not the cause of the poverty of anybody; the process that makes some people rich is, on the contrary, the corollary of the process that improves many peoples want satisfaction. The entrepreneurs, the capitalists and the technologists prosper as far as they succeed in best supplying the consumers."" The rich do not live at the expense of the poor, nor do the rich feel particularly secure in a free market; they often seek government intervention to protect them from competition. But any gains to the rich not only are the result of creating value for the consuming public, they often lead to direct benefits for the poor over time by way of lower prices and access to new technologies. Even the most selfish, peasant-hating rich person wants to buy fancy new luxuries. Whether they like it or not, being early adopters of such goods helps fund the continual production, research and development of new technology and can bring the cost of production down over time. There is not a modern convenience in existence that did not begin as a plaything of the super-wealthy. TVs, cars, washing machines, cell phones, etc., ad nauseam. If there were no wealthy customers around to purchase these impractical items, it would have been nearly impossible for producers to continue to refine them and lower the cost of production. Rich and poor can certainly dislike each other in a free market, but they cannot avoid helping each other.

Urine is perfectly sterile, and poses no health risk. Furthermore, I would argue that complaints about having to look at someone weeing (and possibly catching sight of their genitalia) are as immature and repressive as opposing public breastfeeding.

[Stats.](http://vidstatsx.com/youtube-top-100-most-subscribed-channels)

Channels like Smosh, PewDiePie, RayWilliamJohnson, Tobuscus, JennaMarbles, shmoyoho, Fred, annoyingorange, and other well known ones (I'm sure you know which) seem to be fooling other creators into thinking that acting stupid or creating empty, useless content is the key to success. Youtube isn't really Youtube anymore. You never see any new, refreshing content nowadays. When you do, it's always almost completely unknown and being overshadowed by what's big. After constant failures, users seem to be jumping on the bandwagon and trying to imitate what bigger names are doing. Creativity is essentially dieing, and what we get is stagnant, unfunny, empty, vapid content.  

Channels like Vsauce, vlogbrothers, MysteryGuitarMan, sxephil, zefrank, smartereveryday and others put so much more effort in their content but have only a fraction of the subscribers. Granted, the audiences of these channels is a lot stronger and more enriched. When you walk away from those channels' content, you always take something away, whether it be new knowledge, something to ponder, a new view about something, or a general feeling of awe, it's something at least. Whenever I try to enjoy any of the content that top makers are dishing out, I simply don't understand why it's so popular. I understand the idea of mindless entertainment, but there are so many other better sources for that. 

New users of Youtube are likely to see these top creators first, which does absolutely no justice at all to what's really out there. They should add an ""upcoming"" page on youtube that shows very new or lesser known channels gaining lots of traction to be seen. Maybe mix up the front page entirely every week. Maybe put new users through an ""OkCupid"" style of quiz to dial in what sorts of things they're looking for or are interested in, and then offer up several channels that meet these specific needs. Something, *anything* to get new, fresh creators in the spotlight. Top users don't need the exposure anymore. They have anywhere between 5 and 10 million subscribers. Their video views alone generate millions of views by default just from the shear volume of followers. The stats show they rake in 10,000 to 50,000 new subs a day, and 50,000 to 100,000 new subs a week. They've already established themselves and are self sustaining. Hell, a lot of VEVO channels dominate the top of the list and should naturally be exempt from the charts due to the nature of the content. 

I'm really questioning *why* the top content has made it to the top. Compared to other things, it's really sub par in nature to what others are doing. Even the content I don't care for, there are literally other channels doing the same stuff, and doing it a lot better. Some may say that it's just my opinion, but I'm really starting to think that maybe it's not. There has to be some reason for why things are panning out the way they are, because it just doesn't look right.  The quality is literally nonexistent now. 

I'm beginning to think that top creators are either:

1)  generating so much revenue that Google/Youtube is intentionally making it easier for them to stay successful in order to keep money rolling in due to influence... 

2) or these creators' success was a total fluke, and they got too popular, too quickly, which means the content never evolved from hard work and was stunted in sort of a rough, unrefined, infant stage. New users joined the site looking for this content and saw this unrefined garbage on top, and thought ""well it's the most popular so it must be the best right now"", which only further helped the success snowball. 

Either way, at the end of the day, Youtube has become absolutely diluted in garbage content, and with so much money involved/invested in this weak content, it only further encourages it, and change seems impossible. The structure of the website atm lets the big get bigger, and the small to wither away. True high effort content and creativity is being suffocated and smothered out. Because of this, these users are at the risk of ceasing what they're doing completely, or changing things up in order to imitate what the big names are doing. 

Until new, fresh content is given a proper chance, or a new structure is implemented that exposes users only to content they're truly interested in from the start, the current big names will remain on top and be the ""gold standard"" of what success on Youtube should be like.

I find such quotes to be riddled with not only excessively inflammatory language, but also devoid of any real logic or sense. 

In their larger talks and books, it does not get better. It almost seems as though they are not even trying to convince anyone but rather to just aggravate theists. Their presentations are usually histrionic and replete with usages of exceptions and extreme cases which are then generalized (Westboro Baptists for how Christians REALLY see the GLBT community). Another example would be The God Delusion. 

Here is another example: [IWSMT on NDT](http://iwastesomuchtime.com/on/?i=68456)

The above example is a perfect example of terrible logic. NDT takes a medical term, twists it to fit a certain point of view, takes a hugely contested concept (predestination), and combines them for a very poor conclusion. This is sophistry, pure and simple. Sophistry is not designed to win people over, but to make them feel stupid and to shut them up. Such behavior is not helpful in civil society and hurts real dialogue and civil behavior amongst people who disagree. 

Edit: I suppose the IWSMT quote got me on a hate train for NDT, but apparently there is no source for it yet. I am attacking that sort of attitude however present in books and speeches given by people like Dawkins, Harris, Dennet, and Stenger who made scientific careers and then built their argument against religion on science in such a way that i find intellectually dishonest and excessively aggressive. So I apologize for linking a quote that is rather unfounded (for now).

The idea is that people are much less likely to speak their mind if they believe they are going against what is socially acceptable.

To start, I believe the idea of Mensa calling people 'geniuses' and representing themselves as the smartest people in the world is very elitist. My main point is that you get into Mensa based off of a test of natural intelligence, which means you don't actually have to do anything extraordinary to get into this elite group. I mean its the same as a club for tall people, sure it can exist, but someone shouldn't be celebrated for being tall.While being naturally intelligent will help, it is by no means the most important factor in determining success. True success, academic or otherwise, is obtained mainly by hard work and creativity. 

To my second point, it doesn't seem to actually have any use. While, obviously, there will be extremely influential academics in Mensa, some members really won't have anything to contribute, and all Mensa seems to be is a bunch of people discussing amongst themselves, rather than influencing others. Also, if a group for intelectual discussion is needed, why not judge people based on actual academic work and accomplishments, rather than something that is natural. 

So basically, my reasoning is that you don't actually have to accomplish anything to get into Mensa, therefore it shouldn't be celebrated or treated as a society for academic people. I'm aware that good discussion probably does occur in Mensa, but why limit it to people with high IQ? People shouldn't believe that a high IQ is needed for academic accomplishment, and it isn't. So really, the society isn't necessary, or at least the IQ requirement isn't. I'm not saying it should be disbanded, I just believe it shouldn't be celebrated as a great society, nor should they display the elitism they do.

It has no persuasive power, and builds resentment towards you in the other person, which is the opposite of what you want when you're trying to get them to consider your opinion.

Maybe you could make a case that some views deserve ridicule, like racism and eugenics, but when engaged with those people, insults only play into their preconceptions and help them to internally validate their beliefs. You legitimize them by making them a victim in their own eyes.

Even if the original *intent* of war is good, ie to liberate and bring democracy, the people who are paid to go over there and murder the people in charge are not heroes. People that risk their lives to save strangers day to day are heroes. We shouldn't raise money to support the troops if they get injured either, they signed up to risk fatal injury in the first place.

I seem to be in a minority here, so please CMV.

**EDIT:** Wow. I did not expect this post to invoke such a response. Thank you all so much, it's been quite a reflective 24 hours. You have all taken time to compose serious and well thought out responses and I am very grateful. I wish I could have replied to you all.

I have read all the comments and I felt like I had something to say to everybody. I was surprised at the amount of people who were fighting my corner, and put into words what I find hard to express. I expected to get completely driven into the ground. 

Just before I go on I apologise if I offended anybody in the military or has someone they care about in the military. I don't detract from someone's human nature and think a military personnel is any less of a person than anybody else or should be treated differently.

I think my view is now a lot more open minded, but I wouldn't say it has changed. Right now, the general public talk about 'the horrors of war', so although we can't understand war until we are there, no one who signs up to be on the front line can be surprised by what they face, regardless of how young they are. Most young people decide not to join the military, and saying that young people that do are just kids seems to insult their intelligence or maturity for whatever reasons they have for signing up.

I can't heap all the blame onto the Government or commanders for war, the people who *volunteer* know what they are doing and do not have to do it, but the job they have chosen is to follow orders, which everyone knows in the army means to occasionally(?) kill. 

Some people have said that if no one volunteered then people would definitely be drafted. I don't believe this is the case. We live in a democracy. If no one volunteers, that means no one wants to go to war, and no one would vote for a politician that wanted to introduce conscription. Also volunteering to stop someone else having to join is probably a reason for only a small minority of military personnel.

Additionally if WW3 broke out and people I knew were conscripted, I still wouldn't hail them 'heroes'. No one is a hero just for doing what the Government tells them to do. I see a hero who does something with noble intent. I think that's why our current armed forces are seen as heroes because they volunteer, but again only an idiot would join the armed forces expecting to just hold weaponry and never use it.

I don't dehumanise soldiers. Quite the opposite. I think they are humans just like everyone else and have empathy and intelligence to make good decisions. If anyone is dehumanising anyone, it's the soldiers and their leaders when they shoot down their fellow man. I also feel that grouping an entire group of people with one job as heroes detracts from what a real hero is. A soldier that kills someone and then pisses on the body is not a hero. Often it's the brutality of it all that drives people to commit atrocious acts like that, but you will still get nasty or immoral people in the military regardless. These acts go on and we rarely hear of them because people would lose faith. You can't group all soldiers into 'hero' category when some of them are inherently bad people.

/u/Potaoe_away, I agree. The main thing people who are deployed are thinking about when they get back is getting home to their families, not a heroes welcome. I think the media is responsible for telling us what our views of the military should be. My cause for concern came from the reaction I got from my peers when I refused to donate money to the Royal British Legion on Remembrance Day. I genuinely feel very isolated for holding the views that I do.

In summary I now see why people support the troops a lot clearer than I did, but I feel more confident in my own views and how to execute them if ever I enter into another debate.

The median income in the U.S. is 26,000 a year.

I'm not saying that teachers are living high on the hog, but they're doing a hell of a lot better than most people.

I've heard people claim that teachers ought to be paid more because their job is stressful. I recognize that there are many downsides: bad parents, bad administration, apathetic kids. But, is the job itself really that bad compared to what most Americans do? Most people have shitty jobs in retail, or restaurants, or factories, doing the same boring thing, day, after day, after day for shit pay while never getting to see any positive results from their work. As a teacher, every day is different. There's a mental challenge. You often get those moments where you see how you've made a difference in the life of a child by helping them write better, or understand math, or whatever. You also get summers off. So, it is my current belief that the job quality of teachers is better than that of most jobs.

I also don't think teaching is difficult. To be fair, I think teaching well is incredibly difficult. But, I don't think that ability is a requirement to enter the profession. Teacher ed programs are notorious for being easy, often serving as a back-up for those that can't cut it in other majors. I actually wanted to be a teacher for a very long time. I asked all of my old teachers about teacher ed programs; every single one of them told me it was a joke. Teachers also score below average on the SAT's. When you get in, it's very difficult to be fired, even without tenure. 

I've also heard people say that teachers ought to be paid more because their job is so important to society. I agree that public education is essential to society. But, lots of jobs are essential to society. Without farmers, stockers and cashiers, we wouldn't eat. Why should teachers be treated special?

In short, it seems to me that teaching offers a high level of income, a high level of job quality, and is a field that doesn't require a high level of skill or intelligence.

To be fair, I would prefer if we raised teacher pay significantly, while also significantly raising the bar for who can become a teacher. But with the system the way it is, I don't see any reason to raise teacher pay.

1372724771.0,57,self.changemyview,1hgp6l,I don't believe that libertarianism or anarchism can solve the Prisoner's Dilemma. CMV,TooMuchPants,70,13,210,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hgp6l/i_dont_believe_that_libertarianism_or_anarchism/,"I'll admit up front that I'm using a particular interpretation of the famous prisoner's dilemma.  I've heard of others, but I'm going to ignore them because it doesn't affect my point at all, really.

[Here is the prisoner's dilemma, quoted from wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_dilemma):

Two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned. Each prisoner is in solitary confinement with no means of speaking to or exchanging messages with the other. The police admit they don't have enough evidence to convict the pair on the principal charge. They plan to sentence both to a year in prison on a lesser charge. Simultaneously, the police offer each prisoner a Faustian bargain. If he testifies against his partner, he will go free while the partner will get three years in prison on the main charge. Oh, yes, there is a catch ... If both prisoners testify against each other, both will be sentenced to two years in jail.

The most important feature of this particular situation is that the best overall outcome (meaning the least total number of years served) is gained by both cooperating.  However, the best outcome for each individual is reached by defecting.  If both players defect, this leads to the worst possible outcome.

In other words, we're both better of if we cooperate, however *I'm* even better off if you cooperate and I cheat.  If both players reason this way, they both cheat and end up with the worst possible outcome.

  There are lots of real world examples of situations which have this property.  The most famous one is probably environmental pollution.  If several people own factories next to a river, they are all better off if none of them pollute it, as this ruins the river.  However, once one of them knows all of his competitors are better off cooperating, he has a huge incentive to cheat and pollute by himself.  Maybe his pollution alone isn't enough to destroy the river, and now he can cut costs and charge less for whatever he is selling.  If everyone has this same incentive, they will all pollute and destroy the river.

Modern liberal political systems have a solution to this social problem.  The government can just force people to cooperate, forcing the game into an equilibrium with the best outcome for everyone.  I remember reading about how Cigarette companies were actually excited for the advertising ban on cigarettes for this reason.  Now that they know their competitors couldn't advertise, they could now comfortably not advertise with no downside.

So with all of that said, how do libertarians and an-caps deal with this kind of situation?  Forcing people to cooperate against their will is fundamentally immoral in their view, isn't it?  So wouldn't these situations always tend towards Nash Equilibrium, with all rational actors choosing to cheat?

The argument is known as the SLED argument.

Their are only 4 things different from a unborn baby, and a human. These four things are Size, Level of development, environment, and dependency. 

Is it ok to kill a child, because it is smaller than you?

Is it ok to kill a baby because it dependns on you?

Is it ok to kill someone in a different envioment?

And is it ok to kill someone that is dependent on others?

Now, I know this is a opposing view from the majoirty of the people here. I wonder why people are so ok with just killing someone that hasent had a choice themselves. The child cant choose for themselves.

In cases of rape, abortion is still wrong. Why should the child pay for another persons crime?

I don’t think we are going to stand up and take our government back at least not until the sharrade is over and the whole country collapses.  By the time that happens those responsible will have already abandoned the sinking ship leading us to fight amongst ourselves.

I don’t see the point of trying to effect change and there’s a very good chance when the next round of elections come around I will stay home because even if I find a candidate I like I have no confidence they are not lying through their teeth.

Anyone who is honest, has no damn chance of even getting on the ballot.

Most of us are afraid of death. **Not only our own death, but the death of relatives and friends.** The fact that we will never ever see then again is somewhat scary. 

But here comes religion. In the common religions in the western culture, there is heaven or reincarnation. Something that make death a lot less scary. Here is the problem. If someone is religious, and **truly** believes in their religion, why so many people suffer from death? I am scared of death. It is the absolute end of everyone.

But strangely enough, it is not seems what happen around. We don't see stuff like ""Atheists are highly more susceptible from suffering depression"".

A few weeks ago, /u/TofuTofu made [an announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/1f9wxx/the_above_the_game_book_kickstarter_project_is/) that he was kickstarting a book, his [seduction guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/11ng7n/above_the_game_intro_my_story_preview_of_my/) that he had been writing for a few months now.

However, the kickstarter project met some very vocal opposition, with large subs like /r/Feminism, /r/women, /r/srs, etc. circulating petitions to get it taken down, and encouraging writing in to kickstarter to get their opinion heard.

Then, earlier today, Kickstarter posted a blog post titled ""[We Were Wrong](http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/we-were-wrong) where they said they apologized for not responding to the initial complaints, and said they were removing the kickstarter. The money raised, $16,000 from over 700 backers, would still go to the recipient, though.

The rule that the project 'broke' was this one:

&gt;No offensive material (hate speech, etc.); pornographic material; or projects endorsing or opposing a political candidate.

While I believe and support Kickstarter's right to take down whatever projects they wish, my personal view is that they shouldn't have taken down this project. The book was accused of being misogynistic, mainly because of quotes from it being taken out of context. I think that label is unfair, and is a result of people choosing to label things that they don't like with terms that makes them easily dismissible. 

I believe that by kickstarter taking down the project, they set a dangerous precedent for people being able to complain and have 'offensive' projects removed. Kickstarter should not have removed the project, as the complaints of it being misogynistic are unwarranted, and the term was used to censor something that people didn't like.

A short while ago I started personalizing reddit and started reading the subreddits that specialize in ideas, like this one. As a european, I've been really surprised by the ego of american people, the fetishization of individuality, and how this bleeds into political and social ideas, such as freedoms and personal rights. 

To give an example, it seems crazy to me that in a discussion about gun control, people will justify their right to bear arms on the basis that they retain the right to fight the police and government if necessary. A debate on that very subject is currently ranked high on CMV, and I find it baffling that along with statistics about violent crime etc, people are saying, without a shred of irony, that they will use their arms to fight off the police and military, if necessary.

Similarly, in a discussion about socialized healthcare, people will claim that taxes are the equivalent to somebody breaking into your house and stealing your money. 

A few weeks ago I exchanged a few messages with somebody on CMV who advocated, in all seriousness, a society with absolutely no taxes whatsoever. 

I understand the ideology, but to me, it seems so out of touch with reality. It is idealism gone mad and I think that the cult of the individual, and the worship of the ego, has placed many americans completely out of touch with reality. You aren't going to fight off the military and police with your gun, and how likely is it that that you will *ever* need to? There's an obvious difference between paying a tax and somebody stealing your stuff. 

Its like that Steinbeck quote, which has become a cliche, ""socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires"".

In a nutshell, I'm saying, many Americans shy away from collectivism, not because of a genuinely logical disagreement with the ideology of collectivism, but because they are totally disillusioned about the importance of the individual. This disproportionate over-estimation of their own importance leads to political and social ideas that ultimately make things worse, for both society and ultimately, the individual. CMV.

By the way, I've noticed that responses to this line of thinking are often aggressive and/or often straw man arguments, so for the record, I'm not advocating communism, I'm not advocating blind trust in an authoritarian government, I'm not even being anti-American. I'm suggesting that Americans are disillusioned about the importance of their individuality, which shapes political ideas that seem odd to the rest of the western world. Nothing more, nothing less.

1367713457.0,58,self.changemyview,1dpg8z,"If you're a short guy, you are physically unattractive to women, period.",PlzExterminateMe,87,29,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dpg8z/if_youre_a_short_guy_you_are_physically/,"**REDDIT, I'D LIKE YOU TO TRY AND CHANGE MY VIEW ON THIS, BECAUSE I'M A SHORT GUY WHO IS ABOUT TO TRY DATING FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND WHO IS VERY APPREHENTIOUS ABOUT IT DUE TO THE SHIT I'M ABOUT TO METION.** 

Let's face it: short guys are screwed when it comes to dating. From what I can gather by eavesdropping on female conversations both in real life and on female-centered forums of the internet, women considered short men a waste of human space at worst (https://twitter.com/expsnghghtsm), and at best a tribe of men carrying a physical curse that makes them unattractive but datable provided he ""makes up for it in other ways"" and provided the woman can ""get over the height aspect."" It's a permanent strike against you either way. (By the way, while women will tolerate a short guy provided he has made up for his ""defect"" with confidence, money, or whatever, it's apparently not a good idea for short guys to try and make up for their defect, since they run the risk of being labeled a sufferer of Short Man Syndrome.)

To call the female preference for tallness a mere ""preference"" is a gross understatement. 

First of all, if it's a preference, it just happens to be a preference that every female has. Yes, I can confidently say that nearly every single female, when she envisions her ideal man, envisions a guy around 6'2"", plus or minus a few inches depending on how tall she is. The envisioned ideal man gets exponentially less attractive as his height decreases linearly. In fact, were this guy 5'5"", it's likely she'd a prefer a 6'2"" guy who is less-than-handsome facially. Which really sucks for short guys who were blessed with Brad Pitt-like facial aesthetics. The curse is permanent.

Second, this preference is more like a deal-breaker for many women. ""Height requirements"" are a real thing, and they're explicit in the online dating world. Women will usually argue that men have equivalent deal-breakers, such as boob size, but the fact is that even the guys with obsessive boob fetishes, if they're straight, don't give a fuck as long as she's pretty: http://i.imgur.com/721Wc9l.jpg. Not to mention the fact a large percentage of men actually prefer small boobs or a completely flat chest. 

Third, the preference is largely about ego. It's not just some personal taste, like I how I prefer strawberry ice cream to chocolate ice cream. Women want a tall guy so they can look good next to him in Facebook pictures, so they can look good paraded next to him down the church aisle, and so they can have some tall sons to show off. Since height is associated with status in our culture, having a tall boyfriend or husband is a status symbol. I do know some short guys with hot girlfriends, and I sense that, while the girlfriends love being around the guy, they aren't terribly excited about showing him off to their parents or to other girls. They almost seem embarrassed. I had the displeasure of witnessing an event where a group of girls were talking and after one mentioned that her boyfriend was 5'4"", the other girls in group kind of gave her an ""I'm sorry about that"" face, if you know what I mean. Sad. 

I'll list my answers to some frequently given objections whenever I bring up the hopelessness that myself (5'7"") and other short guys seem to have in the dating world. Then I'd like you to convince me that I'm wrong about all this.

**You're a misogynist because you don't think women are allowed to have preferences.**  Incorrect. I'm not a misogynist and I actually never said anything about whether women ""should be allowed"" to do this or that; and further, I never made any claims about what's immoral and moral. The closest thing I made to a moral judgement was that ""It's sad"" when I see how short guys get treated, and that's just a statement about my emotional reaction. You might be surprised to hear that I have no problem with women, or anyone, being shallow or egotistical. What irks me is that short guys are always given by women the disingenuous advice that if they're not succeeding with women, it's only because of their lack of confidence or their general attitude. I think that's insulting to a lot of perfectly normal short guys, who don't even think twice about their height, and who are confident and just trying to test their luck with women, and get immediately shut down under the false pretense that they're just too insecure or whatever. 

**Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. are both your height.** Money is the great equalizer. Bringing money into a discussion, especially one about dating, is useless. I'll also say that women haven't seen these guys in real life, and so they might actually find that when they see their handsome faces on such a small body frame, they're actually significantly less attracted to these guys. Hell .... FDR was able to disguise his paralyzation through TV, so I wouldn't be surprised that these guys can maintain a physically attractive male image through elevator shoes, camerawork, etc. Anyhow, they're rich, so this is irrelevant. 

**You're just bitter.** Yeah, and you would be too if you had a ""defect"" that can never be overlooked, and if any attempt you make at doing anything to improve yourself in life is seen as ""compensating."" 

I'll leave you with a statistic: A 5'6"" guy needs to make $183k/yr more than a 6'0"" guy to be equally attractive. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lookism)

In some cultures, those meats aren't weird to eat. So why is cannibalism so terrible?

I should clarify that I'm not interested in hearing about reasons why it's not okay to kill a person. I think we all agree that murder is terrible and (largely) unjust. The situation I'm describing is one where, say, someone hands you a good-looking steak, you eat it, and then it turns out it's human meat. The meat was obtained from a healthy individual who died for completely unrelated reasons and (somehow) it was known that this person was okay with being eaten. I'm talking about just the basic concept of eating human meat. Why should you be disgusted?

EDIT: A good point was brought up - personal preference for (not) eating human meat is fair in itself. We're all allowed to have our likes/dislikes for various things. A better way to phrase the question: **why is it wrong to eat human meat in a situation like the one given above?**

Some say that the magazine is glorifying Dzhokar, comparing his picture to that of other rock stars that have been on the cover.  Some commentators say that the magazine is just putting him on the cover to stir up controversy and sell magazines, which they see as morally reprehensible.  

The accompanying article (I haven't read it, I don't think it's out yet) is supposedly a relatively in-depth look at Tsarnaev's life and influences, and seeks to develop an understanding of why a reportedly nice kid turned into a killer.  I've read comments saying, in effect, ""he's just a sociopath"" or implying that it's irresponsible to look at his motives, as it might lead others to do the same type of thing.  

I think that, on the contrary, if we as a society want to prevent events like the Boston Bombing, we need to understand the forces that drive otherwise normal people to harm others.  Admitting that Tsarnaev may have been a normal, unexceptional individual whose friends, family and political influences somehow drove him to do what he did, and trying to understand exactly how that happened, is not weakness on our part, and it's not forgiving of the actions he ultimately chose to take. On the contrary, I think it's the stronger, more responsible position to both acknowledge Tsarnaev's humanity and do our best to learn how a human could be driven to do the things he did (or supposedly did - I know the trial's not concluded...presumed innocent and all that).

People seem afraid to allow for the possibility that perhaps Tsarnaev is NOT a sociopath, and that he CANNOT be dismissed as simply a crazy and uncomplicated ""evil doer.""  Those same people seem terrified of the possibility that he was just a normal kid in a poisonous environment.  But if that possibility turns out to be correct, it seems to me that we as a society have the responsibility to understand the social circumstances surrounding Tsarnaev that led to the Boston bombing, if only to help prevent such events in the future.

1374018697.0,58,self.changemyview,1ig7ms,I believe that those arguing against national income disparity without supporting international redistribution are somewhat hypocritical. CMV.,tacticalflamingo,71,13,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ig7ms/i_believe_that_those_arguing_against_national/,"To summarize before I begin, I believe the arguments applied by first world inhabitants arguing against high income disparity (i.e. the 1%, etc.) can be applied to advocating that their tax dollars be siphoned to aiding third world countries, where the average income is far lower. Supporting redistributive measures in the states seems unjustifiable to me without supporting redistributive measures internationally. I'm not making any claims about the validity of either redistributive claim, nationally or internationally, merely stating that I believe that one can't hold without the other. Take this as a TLDR. I'll go into more detail in the following.


Consider that the average personal disposable income in China, normalized for purchasing power parity, is around 3000 USD. The same figure in the states is 23000 USD [\(source\)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_per_capita_personal_income). Just for the sake of an upper threshold, since the ""1 person"" phrase is so popular, we'll go with that figure as a benchmark, which [is around 370000 USD in the states](http://money.cnn.com/2012/11/20/news/economy/top-1-percent/index.html). This translates into 16 times higher than the average personal disposable income, assuming the entirety of the 370000 is disposable (a good enough estimate). Using this same scale, anyone who has 48000 or more in disposable income makes 16 times more than the average Chinese citizen. [This is around half the nation as of 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Distribution).

So now that the numbers are out of the way, a couple of points. First, the arguments that we are all Americans (or whatever nationality), and  therefore are not responsible for the wellbeing of the Chinese I don't believe hold. You can draw classes or groups among people wherever you want to and create categories. Rich people could be one category - the one percent, in fact, could be such a category. Chinese and American are such categories. There is also the geographic argument, but again, rich people tend to be segregated from the poor geographically, at least from what I know about the states.

Second, I believe the dependence argument, saying that the one percent, or whatever rich percentage, works no harder than the rest of the country yet reaps the benefits of those he steps on, is also mirror in the China/America comparison. Our consumer economy depends on cheap labor from China, and those of us making a the aforementioned 48k a year definitely enjoy a higher quality of life because of those folks in China. Further, I argue that they work just as hard, or perhaps even harder, than a lot of us in that income bracket.

I'd like to think that I've given this topic quite a bit of thought - a bit of personal background - I used to strongly believe in a higher minimum wage, but then ran into this moral dilemma. If we were to look on the international level - we are all humans on the world scale, after all - and create a poverty level based off of PPI and the same percentile the minimum wage level is in the states currently, a vast majority of those even under the minimum wage level would in fact be paying out, and not receiving aid [\(source\)](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17312819). Why should those of us without as much claim that the incredibly rich should have to redistribute their wealth when we would consider it absurd to redistribute our wealth internationally (I'm sure this is a view that some have, but it isn't common from what I've observed).

To finish - I'd like to just reiterate one of my first points. My view isn't that we should be redistributing international or nationally. It's simply that both views ought to be taken together - either both true or both false. The validity of either is a topic for another day.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,False,,,True,t3_1ig7ms,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ig7ms/i_believe_that_those_arguing_against_national/,

Now I realize that it can be emotionally difficult for people to kill an animal, but that's simply where meat comes from. A lot of people aren't willing to kill their own food, but somehow when it is out of sight, and out of mind it is much more acceptable. I don't think these people should eat meat. If you don't see it as morally acceptable to do something, how is it more acceptable to pay some else to do you dirty work for you?

Obviously I'm not saying we should ban people from eating meat, that'd be ridiculous. But I do think that seeing firsthand where your food comes from very tangibly makes people aware of what a chicken is, both an animal, and meat.

EDIT: 

A) Yes, I realize specialization is a requirement for modern society

B) Mostly my question is in regards to the ""immoral"" aspect. In a hunting context, a lot of people would say, ""Oh it's so sad to kill an animal! How could you do that?!"" But then gladly go to the supermarket to pick up ground beef. Both result in the killing of the animal, so how is me killing something worse than someone else killing it for me?

EDIT 2: 

/u/neurorgasm has it right below, I'm asking about the moral implications behind it, where some people don't seem willing to kill something because it feels wrong to them, but are willing to let someone else do it for a fee. Although what I'm learning from this thread is that most people aren't morally opposed to doing it themselves, they just lack the skillset or the will to dig around in guts for a few hours, which is a perfectly good reason.


My question is more about why the aforementioned people are willing to let someone else do work they see as immoral for them.

1. I think the ""birth defects"" point is irrelevant. We don't stop non-related couples with devastating genes from reproducing, doing so would be seen as an infringement on reproductive rights. There are also ways to prevent that, and other alternatives. It also falsely assumes every incestual couple wants children. 

2. Fucked up power dynamics can happen in other, legal relationships. Not every incestual relationship will necessarily have these issues. Even so, why can't a consenting adult choose to be in a relationship with a undesirable power structure? Assuming the relationship starts after they're all adults. If it doesn't, that's a different issue.

That power issue is also no longer there if hypothetically they didn't grow up together. A parent/child or sibling/sibling could meet on the street, not know, and it wouldn't be any different from a relationship with non-related individuals. Suddenly once they find out they're related, it's illegal. 

Let's take another example. Someone's mom has a boyfriend that grew up with a child. Mother and boyfriend broke up. The child is now an adult and pursues a relationship. It's got the power issue that everyone keeps mentioning, but it's completely legal because they aren't related.

This is an essential part of economic stability within our country (The U.S.) because the purpose of capitalism is to drive innovation by sprouting new ideas (and providing incentives for those new ideas). If we continue to see the growth in plutocracy within the U.S., we will only be fueling the fire for less and less individuals to have the opportunity, ability, time, and finances to create the next idea.
Currently, our federal minimum wage is at $7.25/hr. If the minimum wage were to keep up with productivity from the 70s, it would be $21.72. 
The purchasing power of the lower income social classes continues to dwindle to new lows which, in turn, shifts the demand for various products and services. The recent budget that McDonald's has proposed is based on the assumption that their employees work two full-time jobs, get healthcare for an un-heard-of low cost of $20/month, do not pay for heating their residence, and does not include gasoline directly into their costs.

Without government intervention, the companies (whose sole existence is driven by maximizing profits and minimizing costs) will push for lower and lower wages in order to boost earnings. Karl Marx proposed that capitalism would eventually crumble because of the divide between the workers and the capitalists, leading to a systematic rebellion. If we do not keep the tools in place to support our lower wage workers, our society will have been predicted by a man that most capitalists hate.

1368799750.0,54,self.changemyview,1eine8,I believe the US stock market operates primarily as a large scale Ponzi Scheme. Please CMV,akiws,68,14,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1eine8/i_believe_the_us_stock_market_operates_primarily/,"A bit of clarification first. I understand the benefit of IPOs. I'm not arguing that the system would be better if we removed the opportunity for companies to generate capital from public investors. However, IPOs account for a small percentage of the daily activity that occurs on wall street. The majority of it is a game where players try to guess which tokens the general public will be more interested in tomorrow than they are today.

Also, I'm not arguing that it's necessarily a scam. Rather, it's a Ponzi scheme that has more or less worked up to this point, and will continue to work as long as the financial sector can continue to coerce more and more people to put their money into the market. They do this through several avenues such as lobbying for tax benefits for investors, benefits to employers for offering 401k accounts and matching contributions, and a nationwide propaganda campaign that frightens people with the idea that they won't be able to retire unless they start investing in a market-based retirement account early in life.

I suppose this is the place where I start to lose people who believe in the market. I believe that when you put money into a market account and have your broker buy you shares of Google, Facebook, McDonalds etc. on the open market, it's misleading to say that you're buying a share of any of those companies. **You're buying a token that you can do absolutely nothing with, other than sell it to somebody else later.** Hopefully for more than you paid for it. You will be able to sell it later for more than you paid for it if the following 2 conditions are met:

1. The ratio of [number of shares of that stock people are looking to buy:number of shares of that stock people are looking to sell] is higher on the day you go to sell it than it was on the day you bought it.

2. There hasn't been a large withdrawal of money from the stock market game. In other words, if people get sick of playing this game and decide to take their money out to spend it elsewhere, the average price of shares across the board will drop, because there will be less money in the system to pay for it.

I've heard people tie the trading price of stocks to the ""perceived value"" of the company with which the stock shares a name, but that doesn't legitimize the game as far as I'm concerned. The prices may reflect the perceived value of those **stocks**, but you could say that about any ponzi scheme. As long as the perceived value of the scheme kept going up (which would happen as long as people kept investing money into it), it would qualify as a legitimate investment using the same logic.

And with respect to dividends, there may have been a time when they accounted for a significant portion of a wall street investors return on investment, but that is not the case anymore. A lot of stocks don't offer them. For those that do - when the trading price of the stock can often fluctuate on a daily basis a greater percentage than the annual yield, I would argue that the dividend is not a significant portion of this game.

If I'm looking at this wrong, please CMV. The idea of the stock market (the one they sell you when you're learning about it) is so awesome. The idea of trying to predict public opinion/trends/hysteria by dealing in imaginary tokens with no real value, and hoping that the financial institutions can continue to bring in more people so that your portfolio value appreciates, is not.

If we can assume that over time our chances of being able to leave the planet increase as our knowledge and technology are improved upon then we should be balancing rate of progress and stability with the drain on the Earth's resources.

It also seems to follow from a simple equation that if humanity is sharing this planet the material wealth available to each human in space, energy and physical goods are inversely proportionate to the population. Assuming quality of life is tied to these factors and equal distribution of goods (but aware that things are not so simple) it follows that a lower population would have a higher standard of living.

1366778480.0,51,self.changemyview,1czobl,I think our current amount of meat consumption in the first world is immoral. CMV,jennerality,71,20,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1czobl/i_think_our_current_amount_of_meat_consumption_in/,"I've been pretty undecided about the subject and keep jumping back and forth, but I've come to this conclusion. To preface this, let me say that I *do* eat meat (edit: eat more meat than I need to consume; all things considered I personally don't need to eat *any* meat) and don't necessarily think worse of people who do, but I accept that it is immoral and that I am being immoral. Here are some of my reasons:

* The average meat consumption for people in first world countries is far more than is necessary even on a biological level. It is not any healthier and sometimes even less efficient in terms of energy consumption.

* I don't really accept the ""it's nature"" argument because we don't base our morals on nature. We have created ways to counter nature, and nature does a lot of terrible things. I don't see why we get to pick and choose especially when there's a clear alternative.

* We have progressed to the point that we do not need to eat animals to be nutritious (so why breed animals into a pointless life just to kill them for our pleasure of eating them?).

* Producing meat has negative environmental effects. Unlike other products, there *are* clear alternatives to meat in terms of other means of getting protein. Yes, there is no alternative in terms of pleasure, but there are a lot of things that are pleasurable that we are not allowed to do.

* In another [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1cyjeb/unless_an_animal_clearly_doesnt_enjoy_whats/c9l8q5w), someone brought up the fact that most people oppose bestiality because of the consent problem. But why does the consent problem not apply to eating animals? I don't really see the ""food chain"" or ""naturally omnivore"" argument to be valid because it has become irrelevant due to the fact that humans are just so much better off than animals at this point and have so many options.

* Following in this vein, I think it is too convenient in what animals are acceptable to eat. Pigs are OK, but dogs aren't? Why does our logic apply to one animal but not the other? That in itself doesn't make it immoral, but it's just another point to consider in the context of these arguments.

* Some say meat eating is integral to our culture, but just because something is traditional or cultural does not mean it is moral.

* There's also the whole animal treatment issue before the animals are killed, but I think most people agree that they should be treated better so it's not really a central argument for me in terms of morality of eating meat.

I'm not saying *all* meat production should be ceased, or majorly decreased immediately. There are some economic reasons why this is not viable, but I do think there should be some gradual decrease to eventually get to that level. We are also not really fully sure how nutrition works, so I do think each person is allowed a little bit of meat for survival reasons... but I think eating meat as we are now (for most people, every day, or even several times a day) is immoral. 

I saw a few other threads about this but none of them addressed all of my concerns to change my mind. I enjoy eating meat, but I can't find a way to counter all the arguments satisfactorily. CMV.

1. **Updated submission rule D**: now includes a restriction **requiring moderator approval to post from a throwaway account.** This is *not* an outright ban on throwaway accounts, [since as we mentioned in the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_d) there are definitely legitimate times when throwaways are necessary.  

2. **New comment rule 5**: no ""low effort"" comments. Similar to subreddits like /r/games, /r/askscience, /r/askhistorians, etc. etc. we will start removing comments that add nothing to the discussion. Reaction gifs, memes, puns, or one-liner jokes should not be used when commenting in this subreddit.  

3. **Updated wiki**: certain parts of the [Popular Topics wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/populartopics) desperately needed some updating, so we updated it. In particular, the Social Justice section has been totally updated and is essentially complete.  

4. **CMV Post of the day**: consider this one to be an experiment, unlike the other 3 additions above. Recently, the [reddit admins implemented a much needed sticky feature](http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1jr429/moderators_you_can_now_sticky_a_selfpost_to_the/) that allows the moderators to sticky one self-post to the top of the subreddit (full details can be found in the linked thread). Using this new feature, we want to try out something new rather than just pinning the rules up top: **featuring a CMV thread.**  
   The posts we are looking to feature should have **unique, thought-provoking discussions** and will probably not be found in the Popular Topics wiki. We want to give those posts that are super awesome but end up getting stuck in the new queue a chance at getting the attention they deserve. So far, there's no criteria for how we will pick these threads, but I think once things start going we'll figure one out. If an OP of a thread doesn't want their post stickied, we will of course respect that decision.

These changes are what I and the mod team have been thinking about recently. The percentages show how certain we are about these changes. This post is to hear any more ideas from you all before we go through with any changes. Comments, concerns, and [objections] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8QRExBfQhs) are welcome!  

---  
---  

* **Cleaning up the sidebar**  - 100%

    * What we plan to do: Get rid of unnecessary/obvious rules. The rules that we are definitely keeping are Rules III, V, and VII and the rest can be reworded or should be things we don't have to spell out. We're also getting rid of the TCMV section (more on that ahead).  

        * In defense of Rule V: There's been a number of complaints that this rule is unnecessary. However, the reason I believe it's important is because accusing someone of being closed-minded either leads to a) a flamewar (thus in violation of Rule VII) or b) outright denial. What's the point of accusing them if it leads to nothing? That's why I think it's best to save the accusations for modmail or our IRC channel, where an outside party (the mods) can arbitrate over the issue.  

    * Why we plan on doing this: the rules are super important here. Without everyone following them, this subreddit just won't work. We don't want to see circlejerks over popular opinions or flamewars over unpopular ones. We need everyone to be aware of these rules and to follow them. Thus, making the sidebar clean and easy to read will make them more clear to our users.  

* **Removal/revamp of TCMV** - 99%  

    * What we plan to do: get rid of TCMV posts. Either get rid of it entirely with no replacement, OR implement a ""TCMV megathread"" (weekly? bi-weekly?) where users can share their ""TCMV"" moments from whatever topic they want. ""TCMV Tuesdays"" maybe?  


    * Why we plan on doing this: TCMV posts haven't been very popular at all. It's unfortunate because they're usually pretty interesting posts where someone can share their stories on what they learned about. However, these posts would then usually turn into CMV posts anyways. Users would come in and begin to argue with the TCMV poster. This shouldn't be a problem, however, users who make TCMV threads probably are less willing to have their view changed after sharing their views on these threads. Thus, we want to make a megathread where everyone can share their ""TCMVs"" free from drama.  

* **Tag threads where OP has not responded yet** - 95%  

    * What we plan to do: tag threads as ""No OP replies yet"" until OP actually responds, and then remove said tag.  

    * Why we plan on doing this: OPs should be participating in their own threads. This will encourage OP to respond to comments, and will help users know that there is an active OP in the thread before deciding on whether or not to comment. 

* **Require OP to expand their posts/be more descriptive/minimum word count** - 90%  

    * What we plan to do: require the OP of a CMV thread to describe their views in more detail. As for how long the description should be, we were thinking of either going with a minimum word count or a ""I know it's long enough when I see it!"" by the mods.  

    * Why we plan on doing this: It's my personal philosophy here that *if OP isn't serious about their CMV thread, then why should the users take their thread seriously?* Thus, OP should have to explain **not only *what* their view is, but also *why* they hold that view**. This why should not be one word or one sentence long, but something that effectively captures your entire reasoning behind your view. This will also help weed out troll threads.  

* **Tag threads where OP has had their view changed** - 80%  

    * What we plan to do: have DeltaBot auto-tag threads where OP has given out deltas.  

    * Why we plan on doing this: so that new users won't have to waste their time convincing an already convinced OP  AND that users with similar viewpoints as OP can see if there are convincing arguments in the thread  

* **Alternatively: tag threads with number of awarded deltas** - 80%  

    * What we plan to do: have DeltaBot auto-tag threads with the number of awarded deltas  

    * Why we plan on doing this: so users can know if a thread is worth responding to  

* **Require mod approval for meta posts** - 75%  

    * What we plan to do: ban meta posts unless they are mod approved either through IRC or modmail  

    * Why we plan on doing this: many of these threads usually involve things we've already discussed internally or already had threads about and are still discussing. If it's a new topic that we feel should get some community input for, then we'll give allow it to be posted.  


* **Reducing repeat/similar questions** - 65%  

    * What we plan to do: reduce heavily repeated topics that the veteran users feel are flooding the sub  

    * How we plan on doing this: not entirely sure. Here are some ideas that have been brought up before:  

        * Link flair like in /r/askscience. Pros: users can easily sort through topics they find interesting. Cons: OPs might not like their threads to be simplified down to tags. We also might not be able to categorize everything effectively.  

        * Weekly ""themes."" Like /r/redditdayof, where users must abide by certain themes when making their posts. Pros: much more variety in the posts. Interesting new topics can be brought up. Cons: users won't be able to post what they're urging to post during these times.  

        * Using the wiki page to categorize topics. Possibly add a new mod who could handle this, too. Pros: neat categorization of common topics like in /r/askhistorians. Cons: would require someone to keep up with and make sure it's up to date. Also, not many people know that the wiki exists or bother to read it, so it might go unnoticed.  


        * Outright removal of repeat threads within a certain timeframe. Ex. if we see two abortion threads within the same day, then we remove the second one posted. Pros: greatly cut down on repeat questions. Cons: many topics have subtle differences that could be erased by removing them.  

    * Why we plan on doing this: encourage variety. Not have the sub flooded with common topics that you would see elsewhere on Reddit.  

* **Banning Neutral Posts** - 50% (ha)  

    * What we plan to do: ban neutral posts like ""I don't have a strong view on X, CMV either way.""  

    * Why we plan on doing this: CMV should be about an OP wanting to have their view changed on a certain subject. Some would argue that not holding a particular view is itself a view, but I disagree. Neutral posts like these would just turn into two sides duking it out in the comments while OP sits back and watches. It's my opinion that OP should also be participating in the debates, but without being knowledgeable about a certain view they can't really join in.

Some other quick announcements:  

* **NEW MODS**  

    * These are ""trial"" mods that we've hand picked from the community because of their activity and willingness to follow the rules and otherwise greatly contribute to the community! We hope that with their addition we can keep the quality of this subreddit at a high level. With a few weeks of good modding, they will hopefully become full mods here and, who knows, we might need more mods from the community by that time!  

    * Without further ado, I would like to introduce **/u/computanti, /u/pezz29, /u/Jazz-Cigarettes, and /u/shokwave**!  

* **Traffic stats**  

    * We've been getting some attention from larger subreddits like /r/bestof and /r/depthhub lately (positive attention, of course!). That being said, here's the [traffic stats for the past month] (http://i.imgur.com/Y5d8QDi.png) for all you data lovers out there. As you can see, we had a HUGE spike in growth and activity on May 5th and May 6th, no doubt thanks to our subreddit getting cross-linked!

1368211206.0,54,self.changemyview,1e30x9,"I believe that people who pick a highly saturated major shouldn't complain about a lack of jobs, CMV.",ZippityZoppity,73,19,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e30x9/i_believe_that_people_who_pick_a_highly_saturated/,"A crisis that has been occurring over the past few decades has been an influx of college students in a broad range of fields while respective job fields haven't changed accordingly across the board. For example, someone with an art or humanities degree will have a much more difficult time finding a job related to their field with a Bachelor's degree than an engineer would with the same degree.

This has caused a lot of people to gripe about the lack of jobs. People feel that they are owed a job for going to college. I'm well aware that this is a result of a promise of the ""American dream"" and the indoctrination in teens that they have to go to college to get a decent paying job, but neither of those outright declare that any college degree will result in a well-paying job.

If you're going to college merely to get a job right outside of graduating with a Bachelor's, then you should focus your study on a major that has a lot of jobs available. If you just want to make money, then become an engineer or pick another STEM field (even though science isn't necessarily the best way to make money).

If you want to work in your field because you have a passion for it, then you need to work hard. A Bachelor's degree simply won't cut it - you have to be willing to put in more time for school to earn a better degree if you truly want to work in that field. Competition is prevalent everywhere, and you aren't simply guaranteed a job because you graduated college.

This isn't to say that I don't think we shouldn't have people studying all of the subjects that are prevalent in the world - I value all fields of knowledge. However, I don't feel that people should believe they are *owed* a job.

1365124713.0,52,self.changemyview,1bpbth,"I thin the word feminism has lost all meaning because of modern, western feminism and has become a movement of first world problems that has little connection to the original spirit of the movement. CMV",,74,22,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1bpbth/i_thin_the_word_feminism_has_lost_all_meaning/,"I will begin by saying I am not a sexist or misogynist or one of those ""men's rights"" people. I strongly support full, equal rights for women in the modern world and progress as a race cannot truly occur until that occurs.

However, in recent years many people who call themselves feminists cause me to scoff and roll my eyes at their views and statements they make. As someone who has read classic feminist theory and has followed the equality movement from the beginning,I fully support equality and making sure women are equal to men. 

What I object to is the new wave of feminism that seems to be made up largely of white, college educated, middle to upper class individuals who, in my opinion, put things under the banner of feminism that do not belong there in the classical sense of the word. 

For example, I had a teacher who had a poster in her classroom that read ""pornography is to women of all ages and social groups what Nazi and KKK ligature is to Jewish People and African Americans"". This level of self victimizing was upsetting to me as I failed to see the parallel between the two. I am of the opinion that as long as all involved in a sex act are of age and consent, there is no problem with it. I have heard the arguments against pornography and how it can hurt women, but I have not seen any evidence to firmly support it and I feel that men or women who enjoy pornography should not be shamed for it. When it comes down to it, being against pornography is a personal choice and if you are against it, abstain from it, do not shame others for it. It is not a civil right issue, it is a personal view that should not be imposed upon others in a free society. 

Further more, there has been much discussion recently about roles of women in video games or media and/or over sexual objectification. Again, while not ideal, it is not a civil rights issue and simply a personal preference. Also, men are being more and more objectified in the media as well and while I do not think it is a good thing in either case, I accept that is a part of our society. Sex sells, after all.

Another issue I take is with the ""tumblr feminism"". I have seen posts from the ""I need feminism because..."" movement that ranged from the silly to what could just be called misandry. I see minor issues tacked onto the banner of feminism and I just don't see how it is applicable (fat acceptance, anti-slut shaming ((which I support but do not see as a feminist issue as much of a personal belief)) and other views I personally believe to be frivolous.

Another gripe I have is any criticism or different opinion is often dismissed as sexism without addressing the argument. While many differing opinions often are merely sexism, that does not mean all are and can be painted with a broad brush. On that note, often anyone who is male, particularly a straight white male, will sometimes be told their opinion is not valid because of what they view as ""privilege"" whole ignoring any privileged that females receive.  


I have heard it said that modern feminism is more about total equality for all groups, particularly in response to the pro-gay movement, but in that case, why call it feminism? Why not just humanitarianism or a similar term? 

What it comes down to, is that in the wake of the violent wave of rapes, anti-woman sentiments and institutionalization violence towards women in other parts of the world, western feminism does not really have the same claim to the world as it does in other parts of the world. I am not saying that women have total equality in the western world, we still have a ways to go. I feel that the rhetoric needs to change.

I would love to discuss this and would like to preface by saying I know the examples that I felt were negative were not the norm and were the acts of individuals and not indicative of the movement, but I still felt it was worth mentioning.

-I can't put an exact age because of how diverse any given teen's experience could be. 

-I know there are exceptional teens who have something to contribute, and there are detrimental adults who can behave worse than a 13 year old.

-I think many teen users on reddit fall victim to chasing a false sense of superiority over their peers in real life.

-A teen might also be more susceptible to the echo chamber of like-minded ideas here. And if these views/ideas tend to contradict with those of their peers, their misplaced trust in an anonymous website could become the basis of a ""teenage rebellion"" phase.

-Riddled throughout reddit is **extremely explicit** content that isn't discretioned with anything more than a NSFW warning(either in the post title or as a link in the comment section, nothing a curious individual won't click on) and  /spacedicks, /r/morbidreality , r/ImGoingToHellForThis  r/gore  ,you get the point, there's a lot of rapidly accessible shock value on here.


^(Also, Reddit's userbase does have a very controversial background with underage children)


-Individual subreddits don't exist in a vacuum, many users on /r/teenagers , /r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu , and /r/Minecraft  likely browse the main sub-reddits and numerous other subs. So even though a few subs may be deemed age appropriate, the entirety of reddit and its' community is at their feet and has an influence on them.

-Worthwhile discussion and content needs to be read and interpreted correctly in order to benefit anyone. I think younger teens would be less likely to benefit from the worthwhile things on reddit.


Reddit has no notice of an age requirement or suggestion on the registration box, I believe it should.

EDIT:
**TLDR**


**-An exact age requirement isn't the point,  its just to avoid and protect less mature users.**

**-Younger kids have better/ more appropriate things to be doing**

**-Reddit conveys warped expectations and views of their life**

**-Reddit is a potentially dangerous for their developing mind**

**-Reddit's community influence covers the entire site**

**-Most teens won't get much of a worthwhile benefit from using Reddit.**

After this debacle with Snowden and the NSA, there seems to be a limitless supply of White Knights for the American public and privacy, some armchair ""world issues experts"" throwing in everything from their 2 cents to $5 worth of opinion into the privacy rage inferno. A lot of it involves the 4th Amendment, our privacy, calls for transparency, and the words ""what the government does in our name."" There are too many people out their claiming the ""oh what's next? the government killing citizens on US soil with drones?"" Everything is worst case scenario and the sky is always falling.

People in large numbers are stupid, angry and uncontrollable. Individuals are smart, intelligent, and thoughtful. Too many people subscribe to some Utopian view of the world that if government were tiny the people would be fine and can handle themselves. This is unbelievably naive. People are people and are capable of great good and great evil given the right motivation. Give them a situation with an open outcome and I guarantee that each person chooses something different in the spectrum of possible conclusions. There are good people out their who are still capable of evil and there are evil people out there still capable of good, and there are malcontents set on watching the world burn.

Now I don't understand what people were so surprised over when they found out the government had surveillance on the public. Actually, I assumed we were always under surveillance and really it didn't bother me because I really didn't care. I live in a house, I make enough money to pay bills and buy food, I have electricity and running water and I have my friends and family. I was just lucky to be born here. But it seen there are many people that find that's not enough for them constantly using terms like ""police state"", ""surveillance state"", ""fascism."" I wonder, if somehow all governments were gone tomorrow, all the politicians disappeared, would these paranoid state people truly feel free? Would someone telling them, please don't walk on my lawn as they wander the new lawless Utopia result in a ""police state"" shouting match? How much is too much control for the government and how much is too little?

How naive do you have to be to really think that the enemies of the US only exist outside our borders? They live here too, just like your neighbor whose dog shits your lawn. The world isn't an action movie or a spy thriller, but we have enemies within these borders and we also have insane people willing to spread a little peril. Just a few hundred miles from where I live is the KKK headquarters and I know there are Neo-Nazis active in my state. Do I want them watched? I sure fucking do because I'm not white and as a brown person in a Southern state I exercise my second amendment right every time I leave my home with my CCDW permit in tow. To think that your fellow American are as innocent and hard working and patriotic is just ignorant.

If Snowden did anything, it was to reiterate the point that whistle blowers should be protected, but he and Wikileaks must be pretty dumb if he just proceeds to meander around the globe thinking the only people after him is the US government. He has more secrets in that little white knight head of his and I'm sure more than a few countries would be happy to drill it out of there, figuratively or literally. How is it that so many people are willing to take what he says at face value? Just because he sacrificed everything to bring us the truth? So did Jesus and I don't believe that story. What were his real motivations? Why travel to Hong Kong first, to China who is more than happy for the secrets of the US government? Then to Russia who would equally be happy for some secrets? Anyone? Did anyone catch that the first 2 countries he ""fled"" to are 2 superpowers who have been our enemies previously? Does anyone know that Ecuador is closer to the US than to Russia and he could have taken a plane to Ecuador for a lot cheaper? Who is bankrolling these travels and accommodations at these destinations? He isn't the plucky hero everyone wants him to be.

And if you really believe that governments don't spy on each other and the US is the only big bad guy then you probably have a tumor. Did you know the Vatican has an intelligence agency all over the world? Think about that next time you go to church to confess. Governments spy on their friends, on their enemies, on their enemies friends and it's one big messy intelligence orgy. Do you think the US just blindly and bluntly proceeds through international affairs with no guidance and no information? Information is true power. How else are we supposed to be making decisions about who we are allies with, who we fight and who has switched sides? We need information and acting like our intelligence gathering tools and capabilities are the only big bad evil is naive, simplistic and just small world thinking. 

Because of Snowden the US looks weak and our rights and freedoms look more like a hindrance to our standing on the international stage. Obviously someone with say ""But it's about what's right!"" No it's not, It's about the context the action is taken in. Our country is really the only one with everyone thinking their individual opinions are unique and special. You are not a snowflake. Many countries have general sense of nationalism and pride with making their country a world power and everyone pulls together. Even in China, where they have the Great Firewall of China and their own version of FB which was used against it's citizens organizing an uprising a few years ago, people still believe in the family unit and working together as a country to make it great. In the US we work separately as individuals badmouthing a country we were lucky to be born in that have homeless people who can afford cell phones.

I've never been in a relationship, never had sex, and I think it's because of the way I was raised: to believe that two people just can't honestly *like* each other for who they are, enough to strip down and stick body parts in each other. I've grown to see sex (and relationships in general) as just another transaction, like buying groceries, and that's pretty disturbing to me.

My parents got an arranged marriage. They're ""okay"" with each other and get along well like business partners, but I've never seen them say ""I love you"" to each other or even touch each other. My extended family's the same way, and in fact a lot of my uncles and aunts seem unhappy with each other.

As an American, I idealized the ""love and then get married"" idea for a long time but now that I look at it, that seems like bullshit too. 50% divorce rate is horrible, and I'm sure that a some of people who don't divorce still cheat on each other. So the amount of people who fall in love, get married, and stay happily married... is quite low.

So arranged relationships are a sham and so are love relationships. Having thought about this a while, I've come to the conclusion that romantic love itself is probably not a real thing. Most likely, people are selfish to the core and at the end of they day, everyone wants to get ahead in life. By getting with a hot person for sexual pleasure, or getting with a rich person for material pleasure, or getting with a funny person so that they'll be the center of attention at social gatherings. To make themselves feel better about all this, people talk about ""selfless love"" and all that jazz.

I was wanting to get the opposite point of view on this issue before I decide where I stand. So, here we go!

**Premise:** Capitalism is an inherently exploitative system.

**Reasons:**

1. By definition, your employer makes more money off what your labor provides them than they pay you.

A common counter: Your employer provides you the opportunity to work which you would not have had otherwise. Your work for them is a net benefit to both of you.

Retort: Where did the employer get the opportunity to provide me with the opportunity? They got a ""head start"", in terms of either capital or education, that allowed them to start their business. This ""head start"", which is essentially given randomly depending on where you are born, does not seem like a compelling reason why someone  should be able to profit off their employee's work.

2. Capitalism will inherently concentrate wealth into a few individuals. As businesses get more efficient at competing, they gain more capital. More capital makes it easier for them to compete. This positive feedback loop gives them more and more power to the point where they become a monopoly and can control significant aspects of people's lives, giving them more power. 

In capitalism, what is to stop a business from obtaining so much capital that they become a monopoly?

3. The ""voluntary exchange"" principal which capitalism is founded on is fundamentally flawed. Some exchanges may be voluntary, but many are not. There is not much choice between working for barely enough to survive on or dying of starvation. If one person has all the resources and I have none, I am at their mercy to accept whatever contact they give me.

Furthermore, consent can be engineered. This is a common problem with advertising. Human beings are not fundamentally rational agents. Humans evolved with many physiological quirks that can be exploited once you understand what they are. [Anchoring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect) is an example of this. If people are not rational, how can we expect voluntary exchange to be free from one party hurting another? I recommend the book ""Predictably Irrational"" and the documentary ""Century of Self"" for a more elaborate explanation on how consent can be engineered. 

Change my view on this. I want to hear counters to my arguments before I form my opinion. I look forward to what you all have to say.

A short description: B.I.G. is essentially a form of social security whose only condition is citizenship (and the age of 18).  Every American citizen, from the poorest member of society to the richest is provided a yearly salary (bi-weekly or monthly) that accounts for the minimum cost of living and is adjusted to their locale (The B.I.G. someone gets in NYC is different from one in Montana).

Why I hold this view: B.I.G. can be used to revitalize America and resolve many key debates and issues in one fell swoop.  Examples:

* Net economic benefit: by giving everyone money, everyone can spend it to buy things and spur economic growth.  It's harmful to the economy to have poor people who cannot buy things because they are out of work.  

* It improves housing and social mobility: by getting a basic wage, you can start saving money sooner, and you can also relocate to where the jobs are at (if you want one).  A lot of folks are tied down to mortgages which keeps a labor market saturated.  With B.I.G., owning a home is no longer an unrealistic goal for most folks in the lower rungs of poverty.  

* Labor surplus and minimum wage: Now that you have everybody getting a minimum salary, all of a sudden you don't need minimum wage.  Businesses can offer pay at the given value of the job.  

* Employer provided benefits will become a thing of the past: by providing everyone with a B.I.G., they will no longer need employers to provide things like healthcare and other insurance for them.  All money earned in employment is *on top* of what they get from the program.  This means the red tape in businesses is lessened, more businesses can open their doors and compete.

* Spurs innovation: there are millions of Americans with the talent to do excellent work in fields they are afraid to try their hand in.  For some folks, pursuing their dream jobs is something they cannot do working 10 hours a day doing menial labor.  Going to school is expensive, learning trades is a time-intensive investment.  B.I.G. provides some freedom to pursue these goals.  Freeing these people up from flipping burgers to inventing things means innovation, and innovation keeps America on top.

* It cuts down on the bureaucracy and makes government more efficient.  You will no longer need the Social Security Administration, The Dept of Education (at least at its current size or budget outlay), or the bureaucracies managing Medicare and Medicaid.  These programs would be eliminated as B.I.G. takes over.  If everyone has a basic income, they do not need these things.

* With that, ends many useless national debates on health care, unemployment, and social security.  Unemployment becomes a fairly outdated figure...

* Education is also resolved... with everyone getting B.I.G., the emphasis on publicly funded education is a lot less.  Everyone is earning enough money, whatever jobs they have allow them to earn more, so you don't need to send your kids to the local public school.  Also, with all the new found social mobility, you will see private schools or private teaching sessions becoming more commonplace, providing a more involved and intimate learning environment for kids.

* The distribution of wealth in the US will become more equitable, with more people earning, and having the freedom to work and earn more, they will be able to enrich themselves in a way not previously known to be possible.

...and now for the biggest reasons:

* It's already being done in an inefficient manner: Right now, there are a multitude of programs to cover the poor and needy: unemployment insurance, medicare, medicaid, social security, and when all else fails: disability.  Not to mention SNAP.  **These programs fails because they reward failure**, in many instances, it's simply cheaper and easier to stay on disability or welfare than to find and do work.  So why bother?

* It's inevitable: as formerly labor-intensive jobs like manufacturing and farming become automated, we will continue to see a labor surplus.  The labor issue in the United States is not going to get better.  Only worse.

CMV.,hiramugrant,72,22,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1g18a0/i_dont_respect_the_decision_to_be_transsexual_cmv/,"First off, I'm not saying it not ok to identify yourself as transsexual.  I feel everyone is entitled to act he or she pleases.  I just don't think being a transsexual is at all venerable for these reasons:

1. I have always believed (perhaps incorrectly) that transsexuals and transgenders cast away their assigned gender (or sometimes sex) to refute gender roles.  But by embracing *any* gender role at all (i.e. casting away the male gender role to become a female), I feel they are only perpetuating current gender culture.  I believe gender in general is a mostly backwards concept that should not be embraced to much extent.  To swap genders only places needless importance on the current gender system.

2. I feel transgenders (those who seek physical alteration) fundamentally deny themselves of who they really are, physiologically speaking.  If a man removes his penis, he must still live with a y-chromosome in each cell of his body for the remainder of his life; to ignore this is to deny reality.  I think this is a topic of realism vs idealism--ideally, you should be able to define yourself, but realistically you must accept the cards you have been dealt.

Again, I understand people are allowed to do whatever they please.  To be honest, I would respect trans-sexuality more as a fetish than as a lifestyle.

I am sorry if I miss-used any words/didn't use the correct words to describe sexuality.  Hopefully someone can CMV so I can respect the decision transsexuals make.

**edit:**
Many comments seem to be saying being transsexual/transgender is a coping mechanism.  I don't believe it's an appropriate coping mechanism.  To me, it seems like fighting fire with fire; society has imposed gender constraint 
on the people, and transgenders, rather than casting away these constraints, buy into them more and legitimize them.  Aren't people supposed to act like themselves?  Why do people define themselves with gender?

Some points people have made:
1. *Someone in a male body can be born with a female brain*--I don't believe this.  Please provide scientific evidence suggesting this is true.
2. *There is no difference between those who claim they are a different gender and those who claim they are a different species*--I think this is a valid and interesting point and would like to hear more conversation.
3. *There is a gene many transgender people share*--correlation does not prove causation.  I don;t believe just because you have a ""genetic predisposition"" to change gender meas you should actually do it or pay any mind to gender in the first place.

Thank you for all the comments, this is all actually really helpful to me, whether it seems like it or not.

**edit2:**
People keep reiterating that a man (i.e. has penis) can be born with a physiologically female brain (brain with characteristics usually found in the female brain).  I understand this.  I accept this.  Some people claim that a brain is inherently born with a *gender identity*.  I don't think this is totally out of the question, but I would like some explicit evidence to back up the claim *There is scientific evidence that gender identity is the result of our neuroanatomy, rather than some sort of societal construct.*.  What I am most concerned about are *gender roles* and why they are important to the identity of a transgender.  Gender Roles *do* seem to be a societal construct and I personally feel they are a bit arbitrary.  If a man is born with a woman's brain, why is it appropriate for him to wear makeup to fix this perceived problem.  I think it's ok for a man to wear makeup if he likes it; I don't think it's ok for a man to completely embrace most female gender roles in order to fix his sexual hardware incompatibility.  I also understand people do this to cope with problems, I just think this is not a good way to do so.

Again, by this train of thought, I feel changing sex is futile since sex change cannot change the sex of cells.  If a man is born with a woman's brain, he will always have y-chromosomes and will never be completely ""sexually compatible"".

**edit3:**
Alright, so I've listened to a lot people and at this point this is what I believe:

Transsexuality begins at or before birth. Transsexuality causes a person to believe there is an internal incompatibility within the body, almost as if it were an illness. Trying to cope with this incompatibility, they *may possibly* undergo physical, emotional, and personality changes. I may never understand why these desires to change sex arise, just as I may never understand why people hoard garbage or are shy.
Transgenders *may possibly* use masculinity and femininity as a tool to legitimize the change in sex. An analogy might be that a shy person uses a persona to deal with social problems.

If I begin to ask why it is ok to support gender stereotypes, I have to question morality and ethics at a fundamental level, which I do not have the means to do.
Basically I now view transsexuality as a disease rather than some strange, self-empowering way to stick-it-to-the-man. I don't find transsexuals annoying or backwards anymore because I pity them. I am sorry if that is not politically correct, but this is what I actually believe now. I am not trying to drag out an emotional response from anyone.

I may start attending LGBT meetups and meetings to to be exposed to these people. I feel if I'm around real people and see them as more than transsexuals I will have a better chance of empathizing with them. I have no intentions of putting anyone down or talking to them tactlessly (as I do online).

The taxation isn't the only deterrent to make people avoid unhealthy food, but the money generated from this would be put back into health care and education.

I'm still undecided about personal safety, but these are matters for another debate.

While I do believe that armed resistance is a useful tool against the government, I don't think legal weapons will ever be any good against the state.

If weapons owned by citizens have ever proved useful it is because they were illegally obtained, manufactured and against a government with a not very advanced fighting force.

The military will always have better weapons, better training and easier availability and will overwhelm armed citizens easily.

That is not to say that I am dismissing the notion that a citizen's revolt would be successful. I just don't think the second amendment will add much to its success - or failure.

Edit: I think my stance on this has somewhat shifted; in that I failed to recognise the capability of firearms as survival tools in a war of attrition, and that is a significant edge. I still think the need for illegal weapons and other tools are more important and what will really make any difference, but in the case that I need to get there, I would rather be with a gun than without.

I still am not convinced that gun laws don't need to change, but that was never the question and I think my stance has shifted enough that I need to hand out some deltas.

Edit 2: 

I also did not initially consider the possibility of smaller scale violence and its opposition by the citizenry. 

Edit 3: There seems to be some discussion here suggestion a spontaneous uprising. I do not find this a likely scenario and it would be nice if further discussions discussed why it is, in fact a likely scenario, or how an uprising could form. State support was mentioned, and I do find that interesting. 

Thanks for the responses. I'm out for the night. Maybe. 
Cheers again!

Edit 4: As a bonus question, and this is pure speculation - what do you think might precipitate an armed rebellion. I do hold the opinion that the government is not the most ""free"". Drones, financial irresponsibility, wars and then some. So when would that point be that the second amendment would be vindicated in its role as a check against tyranny (without pointing to the past)

Edit 5: 

Ok - from what I have gathered the second amendment is viable because - 

1) It makes a conflict between the government and its people more expensive in terms of lives lost

2) On a small scale - it can be an effective check 

3) The government will be less forceful when fighting its people

4) The gun is a survival tool, and a conflict of this nature just needs to be prolonged

5) The necessitation of deadly force on the part of the government because of gun ownership is a good thing as it would undermine the government

So to change my view, presumably either a better definition of objectivity would need to obtain or profit would have to be shown to be an irrelevant or negligible factor in the motivations and biases of for-profit media.

As a corollary question, even not-for-profit media requires funding for operations, which would bind those media programs to the interests of their private or government donors, and therefore not meet my definition of maximal objectivity. Leads me to wonder: are there viable options for media outside capitalist frameworks?

All that said, one last caveat. I know ""objectivity"" is itself a contested term and that the selection and representation of information is filtered through the subjective values of the institutions and individuals  offering that information.

When Hurricane Katrina hit and people had to temporarily resettle, several black families ended up in my hometown.  For the first time, I saw first hand what actually racial prejudice looked like, as this new group of people dressed different, talked different, participated in different activities, and mostly kept to themselves; while a section of the native populace (many of which were very close friends minority students mentioned above) began to spit plenty of vitriol in their direction.

This struck me as odd, and it began to foster in my mind that many of the situations throughout history where race was involved had far more to do with people viewing other cultures as threatening or inferior and misdirecting the basis of their hatred at the people based on their immutable attributes and not at what they truly dislike.

I dislike the idea of abortions done late in the pregnancy (and consequently believe that abortions should only be legal for the first few months) but they're a rather small minority (and of the ones that are done I'd imagine a fair number are for health reasons, which I'm all for). Both sides have their zealots, and I guess this bothers me more so because I both agree with the core idea behind abortion, but the reasoning used by many pro-choice people strikes me as being rather stupid.

The core of the abortion issue, I believe, is whether or not the fetus has rights. Everything else is just fluff meant to draw people in to either side as well as giving them an excuse to get angry (I remember seeing a thread in...atheism? I think that read something like 'how do christians justify their crusade against women?' in regards to abortion and I couldn't help but roll my eyes.)

If a fetus has the same rights as a person, surely a 'women's right to do what she wants with her body' doesn't trump a fetus' right to, you know, not get murdered. My right to swing my arm ends at your nose and all that, as well as the fact that the right to do what you etc. doesn't include killing other people with it (because duh). Why would that be different with regards to abortion?

I've seen people argue that the fetus doesn't have the right to occupy the women's body without her consent, but isn't the consent implied given that the women is at least partially (rape notwithstanding) responsible for putting it there in the first place? A fetus cannot, by its very nature, be held responsible for literally anything it does before birth, and consequently anything that it does is the fault/responsibility of the parents (more the mother than the father, but hey it does take 2 to get started)

With that said, I genuinely believe that the idea of abortion as a woman's rights issue is less about women's right itself than it is about giving pro-choicers something to get angry about (because one pissed off person who agrees with you is worth  50 calm/quiet ones as far as politics are concerned), and would love to have someone logically change that, since it does strike me as an easier stance to take that it's a women's rights issue but alas I can't side with something I find logically wrong, even if it seems easier, so please CMV.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,False,,,True,t3_1jb0wl,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jb0wl/i_believe_that_the_issue_of_abortion_is_in_no_way/,

If I knew someone who thought they were a duck, I would feel like they should be in a mental hospital, not going through life demanding people throw them bread and making their kids follow them in a line.

In every other case that a person thinks they are something reality disagrees with, we pity them and try to help them without taking them seriously.  If a guy thinks he is Jesus, we aren't obligated to call him Mr. Christ, we put him in a mental hospital.  If a white guy thinks he's black, we laugh at him.  If a furry gets a little too serious and starts thinking they're actually a fox, we all know they're crazy.  Why in this one case should we make an exception?

This goes for surgery as well.  Why is their delusion indulged with medically dangerous and disfiguring surgeries?  If a guy believed he was a duck, it would be highly ethically questionable if not illegal to give him a duck bill and webbed feet with plastic surgery.

Furthermore, I see no scientific evidence that feeling like you belong to the opposite sex is anything but a delusion cooked up in the brain.  The brain has shown itself to be fully capable of deluding itself into believing it is any number of improbable things, so barring extremely solid evidence that trans people truly have the brain makeup of the opposite sex, it is more reasonable to lean towards delusion.

**Edit:**  After a lot of discussion, my views are currently

* There is some physical evidence that trans people may have minor brain differences that are more on the side of the gender they identify with, but no cases of a 'certifiably female brain in a male body' or vice versa

* Sex is defined by your genetic makeup, gender is an artificial construct and you can't mentally 'be' a gender

* Transitioning is an acceptable treatment since it has been found to be helpful even though it is not ideal

* Trans people are still delusional about their sex, and someone who has transitioned remains their original sex.

Prohibition didn't work for the population when it was in place, and this is basically prohibition for a segment of the adult population. I know that the federal government offered more incentives for highway construction or something like that to states that changed, but I'm curious what the actual effect was after the age was raised.

To show my bias, here's what recently sparked my fury. Spring Break road trip with my friends to Colorado. Late at night on a day of constant driving (through scenic Nebraska no less) those of us who already took our driving shifts decide to have a couple beers. Driver gets pulled over for speeding. Cop smells booze and asks to see IDs of everyone. Whelp turns out if your over 18 but under 21 you have to go to jail for drinking in Nebraska so I get arrested and it is a non-waiverable offense, meaning I am legally obligated to go to court to in all likelihood end up with a simple ticket.

Please don't waste your time telling me if I can't do the time, don't do the crime. I'm an adult. I go to college. Have a job. Pay my bills and taxes on time. And I drink responsibly. While that may not be true for everybody my age, it sure as shit isn't true for everyone older either. Maybe there should be some sort of licensing program like driving, but for drinking so that those of us who can prove we can responsibly drink aren't punished because of those who can't.

Arguing against that constitutes a straw man.

The point of copyright (as i understand it) was, at least originally, to stimulate the production of creative works, by giving to the creator for a limited period (originally 28 years after publication of the work) ""the exclusive rights to their work"". That way artists, writers, ... wouldn't have to worry about people plagiarising their existing work and could focus on creating more works. After this limited period, the work would be in the public domain, free for everyone to use.

However, the current ""limited period"" for copyright has been extended to: the lifetime of the author + 70 years (In most European and American countries, and even there exeptions (works by the government = public domain, etc.) abound, but this is the general rule). That is insane. To quote CGPGrey: ""Who exactly needs copyright after they're dead? Death is the point where literally no force in the universe can compell you to write *one* more screenplay."" Instead of stimulating the creation of creative works, it's preventing it.

Why, well because [everything is a remix](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmwwjikTHxw). People need to be able to use older works to create new ones. An additional factor is that companies/authors might not wish to continue producing works that are no longer profitable to them, making them lost to society.

I could go on about how every country should have [freedom of panorama](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_panorama) and [fair use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use), but for this CMV i only want to talk about the lengt of copyright.

So tl;dr: Current copyright law is too long. Instead of stimulating the production of creative works it gives companies the power to prevent their creation.

Many people say it's clearly a rape joke, I don't think it's a rape joke at all on the grounds that saying something that could possibly be said during a sexual assault in a completely different context doesn't mean that phrase has a sexual connotation to it, especially when it clearly wasn't intended that there be a sexual connotation, triggers be damned.

During the debate about this exchange I've continuously been told that the reason that the above exchange is a rape joke is due to the United States housing a culture that in some way excuses, condones, or in some way facilitates rape. I've been told that I'm so immersed in this culture that I'm blind to the fact that I'm perpetuating it by not seeing this as a rape joke, and that I'm marginalizing rape somehow.

I don't believe that there is a widespread culture in the United States where rape has been in some way normalized, or marginalized, or excused, condoned or facilitated. I do believe that there are cultures that prioritize things *over* rape such as Stubenville, where maintaining the appearance of the small town's supposed ""hometown heroes"" was more important than the atrocities they committed against that girl, or cases where a school or university marginalizes rape because they want to avoid any and all possible litigation, or in College sports/fraternities/sororities, which I think is a den of sociopaths. These are all obviously cases of horrific injustices that marginalize sexual violence and the mindsets that allow for them and people that perpetuate them must be dealt with, but I would hardly say that these people are so widespread as to say that the entirety of the nation somehow condones or allows for rape.

The boy (we'll call him Jeremy), was not severely autistic, but he did have issues with, anger, focusing, and social interactions with his peers. He was in my seventh grade class. Around junior high is when hormones tend to go crazy, and we all begin developing, specifically the girls. I reached puberty a little bit earlier than most and by the seventh grade, I was already a C cup. He noticed full well, and did anything he could to brush up against my breasts. This boy Jeremy would always ""accidentally"" stroll right into the girls locker room, get a little handsy during soccer or basketball in P.E., and make sexist remarks on our bodies. One day, I'd had enough, when Jeremy had smacked my ass particularly hard and *definitely* on purpose. I went to my P.E. teacher first, who was sympathetic, but said there was nothing he could do because Jeremy didn't know any better. I couldn't believe I just had to put up with this. Only when I went home whining to my mom did she call the school, and something was done. The boy was talked to by our P.E. teacher and Jeremy was so pissed, he hit him. Nothing happened after that. He was talked to and that's that. Luckily he transferred to a different school in the eighth grade, but I still believe to this day that Jeremy should have gotten more than a slap on the wrist. 

I don't know a lot about autism, but from what I've gathered from online research is that autism spectrum disorder makes it hard for those who have it to pick up on social cues and have normal interactions to make friends. But should punishment and reinforcement not at least help them see the boundaries that have been set such as personal space, and responsibility for actions? Why did nobody punish this boy? If he was just a regular horny teenager, he would have definitely been given an in-school suspension. 

Is there something I'm missing? CMV, Reddit.

**Edit:**  Thanks so much for the discussion guys! From what I've gathered, autistic kids genuinely don't understand their actions, and will think they're being punished for no reason, and if that keeps happening, they will go into what is called learned helplessness (brought to the table by /u/Tehan). Instead of flat out suspension or detention, what needs to happen with autistic students who have problems behaving should be looked after properly with a plan dedicated to their needs (mentioned by /u/Zomaza), rather than being treated like they don't have this disorder. I hope when (if) I become a teacher, I can get any autistic students in my class proper help, instead of lumping them in with the actual ""bad kids."" You've created one less mean teacher.

CMV",ataraxiary,63,15,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kdlwj/i_believe_that_the_vast_majority_of_rape_is_about/,"I’m a woman.  I’ve never done any formal reading on women’s studies (probably everything I know comes from reddit, whatever that’s worth). In any case, I most certainly have heard that rape is about power, domination, violence, etc. and so forth – but not about sex. It sounded weird when I first heard it many years ago (probably in a movie or on the news, who knows) and honestly it still does. If rape isn’t about sex, why does sex occur instead of just non-sexual violence or abuse? I guess I don’t get it.

In the comments of [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1kbeez/i_believe_that_pornographys_overall_net_impact_on/) on pornography from yesterday, u/Medicalizawhat posted a link to [this article] (http://www.drtraycehansen.com/Pages/writings_politics.html) about rape, power, politics, feminists, etc. It was an interesting read. I don’t know anything about Trayce Hansen, I trust him just as much as any rando on the internet (not a lot), but much of what he said makes sense (I’m ignoring the broad fairly negative brush with which he seems to like painting feminists).

Anyway, I believe that while some rape is undoubtedly about power, **most** rape is about sex. Some people want it (men, women, ducks) and they don’t mind “taking” what they want, even when it is not freely offered. For the record, I have seen the studies saying  that rapists admit to selecting the most submissive victims rather than the most attractive: I don't think this conclusively proves rape is about power. It seems just as likely that rapists are not complete idiots and while they want to satisfy their sexual urges, they still pick the targets that are low effort and low risk (of being vocal, reporting, etc).

My belief doesn’t mean that I deny rape culture (pretty hard to argue after Steubenville, no?) and I don’t think that this means anyone should change what they are wearing (“well, dressed like that, she was ASKING for it!!!”) or their actions (“what did he expect, getting blackout drunk and falling asleep next to someone he doesn’t know, of course he wanted it”). Likewise, my belief that rape is usually about sex doesn’t excuse anyone from even an iota of the blame (except maybe ducks): human men and women alike are both absolutely capable of stifling their sexual urges/desires and it should be the barest of expectations in a civilized society no matter what someone is wearing or how they are acting.

But, I believe it is a better alternative to the current system. There is a lot of stress on students to completely master, or at least satisfactorily ""pass,"" a set amount of material in about nine months. With No Child Left Behind, the standardized test has become the main indicator of the year's progress.But not all students learn the same way or at the same rate. Some who are not performing satisfactorily feel the need to cheat to stay with the pace of the system, remain with their peers, and avoid the stigma attached to being left behind.


The teachers also feel the stress. My fellow teachers told me often how they feel pressured to have the students perform well on the end-of-year tests by any means necessary, even to the detriment of the long-term education of the student (basically, just pump the information in to prep for the tests and let it all go again once they pass and move on to the next grade). This time limit of nine months puts a lot of constraints on teachers, often resulting in the omission of extremely useful skills that aren't deemed necessary because they don't directly prepare for the tests: time management, note-taking and general studying skills, critical thinking, etc.


I just see a system where everyone can go at their own pace, and it sounds wonderful to me. An exceptionally smart child can breeze through the grades, graduate by fifteen, and begin contributing to society at an earlier age. A child who is a little slower feels less stressed to compete with their peers once the notion of competition has been removed. Everyone gets to learn that not everybody is equal at an early age, instead of being smacked in the face with that reality at 18yo.


Some people will say I'm too optimistic. That if there is no incentive to work hard through deadlines and forced progression through grade levels, students' laziness will overcome their pride and work ethic. I frankly just don't believe this, so I guess I am an optimist.


All in all, I've seen and heard too many stories of bored gifted children, stressed slower children, burnt out teachers who just pass the buck to the next grade's teachers, and administrators all but skewing test results to maintain status and/or funding.

Other example would be users with names such as ""ANAL_DESTROYER"" or similar ones: if that user gives good advice, a comment comes saying ""Wow, that coming from you is surprising!"", and the rest of that chain of comments turns into little jokes surrounding that, completely ignoring the advice itself and, again, turning into meta jokes.

CMV,Swrdfshtrmbns,59,15,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1f6nu4/i_think_most_people_are_more_intelligent_than/,"I have encountered a common refrain that has been parroted by lots of different people and organizations and it sounds something like:

- ""We can't allow X because people are too stupid.""
- ""X is hopeless because people are too stupid.""
- ""People are too stupid to make proper decisions for themselves.""
- ""I don't have many friends because most people are stupid.""

The list goes on.  What is fascinating to me is that I hear this is so many different places.  Politicians, the news media, co-workers, friends, social media, television, etc.  It's the most half-assed, defeatist cop-out ever and I think it is brought up to deflect attention from deeper issues the person/organization espousing the opinion doesn't want you to know about.

On an individual level, when someone complains that most people in their lives are ""all idiots"" or that they have ""nobody intelligent to relate to"", it usually indicates to me that they have lived their lives in an unfulfilling way, personally and/or professionally.  I find interesting people everywhere I go, and while I can identify that perhaps others have much higher standards for interpersonal captivation than I do, at some point there has to be an honest confrontation.  It usually comes down to the fact that the unhappy person does not make any effort to find suitable people (they are glued to a computer, for instance) or they are merely comfortable, but not content with their current social situation and just expressing some anxiety.  They may also not be doing anything to increase their personal stock with other interesting people, so others don't care to engage them because someone who spends their free time playing beer pong and watching Family Guy doesn't seem to be approachable to someone who has more engaging hobbies and passions.

In the bigger picture, I think popular political discourse is overwhelmed with a circus of idiocy.  So much presented is a showcase of unreasonable and irrelevant social extremes and oddities that - I think - are intended to convince consumers to put faith is something bigger than themselves because only monolithic organizations have the power to protect them from the scary stupids and to protect the scary stupids from themselves.  The caveat is, of course, that nobody thinks that *they're* the stupid ones.  I think the ""people are stupid"" bit goes hand in hand with ""people are evil"" and ""everything is going to shit"" and other fear-mongering lines.  

I think if more people had the sense that there are really smart people everywhere, and not everyone else around them just being dickbags cutting them off on the interstate or being found in personal disarray at Walmart, the society we live in would be a lot more positive and productive.

I really hope that I am wrong about some of this stuff, because the future is looking really dark in a lot of ways, so please CMV.

  The biggest threat I think humanity as a whole faces right now is global warming. It is a scientific consensus that global warming is happening and that the consequences could be disastrous. Recently, even the more conservative estimates are on the quite disastrous side. Humanity MAY have still have a window to stop greenhouse gas emissions and escape the worst, but I think this is unlikely. Recent signals of feedback loops being triggered (arctic ice, tundra melt, methane emissions from the ocean, Amazon going from carbon sink to carbon source) indicate that we are probably not going to be able to reverse this. This leads to a few reasons why civilization as we know it cannot continue:

1. Pollution is killing off species and warming is destroying habitats. If enough species die, we could see a mass extinction event in a short time with a quick ecological collapse.

2. Disasters caused by global warming have already displaced millions of people around the globe. Also, events such as droughts starve millions. If these kinds of things continue to worsen, the global economy won't be able to stand in the face of the disruption.

3. Food resources will grow scarcer from the above stated reasons. Ironically, oil is also becoming more scarce (this is a good thing for reducing emissions, but probably too late for that). As resources dwindle, we are going to see war increase as a scramble to grab the last remaining energy and food supplies. You could argue that civilization will continue for the victors, but certainly not for large parts of the world population.

4. Arguably none of the above would have happened if we hadn't expanded human population during the 20th century so rapidly. We are probably way past the long-term carrying capacity for the Earth and will see it corrected shortly. Again, you could argue that civilization will continue for the survivors, but I doubt it will look much like it does now.

I guess I could word it a little differently. I think large amounts of people are going to die during this century, and whatever is left over will inevitably be more of a rebuilding than a continuation of civilization.

Thanks and keep the intelligence coming!**

Okay. Gays. Let's talk about them for a second (because they're just not getting enough media coverage these days). Because seriously, I don't understand their mentalities at all. Or their reasonings. This may come off a little rough, but I am seriously just trying to get this off my chest because it has been bothering me a lot lately.


First: I grew up in a home where man + woman = good and man + man or woman + woman was bad. Morally wrong on grounds of religion. And I'm perfectly okay with that. Aside from that, it makes sense to me, in a biological sense, anyway. A man has a penis, it goes into the vagina, babies are born (generally speaking).


So what IS it with gays? How can they be attracted to the same sex at all? It seems like all of the gay people must have a hormone imbalance. ""I was born this way, so I can do what I want!!"" Sure, if you believe that, people with six fingers and five toes in total should also get married to the ocean. Seriously, wtf. It makes no sense.


And frankly, the only difference I can see between gays/lesbians and straight people is the fact that straight people get it on with people of the opposite gender and the other party gets it on with the same gender. Which... honestly sounds more like two people jerking off together. Which sounds kind of gross.


Furthermore, with this huge push for gay marriage... why? Just why? I don't understand. Marriage is for creating families, creating a safe haven where children can be reared. Married people (generally, depending on where you live) pay taxes! And if you're in America, married people are still getting the stiff end of the stick on healthcare. 
There are other things that go along with marriage besides the whole, ""oh, we're so in love let's get married!"" there's finances... time-management... tons of other things! Do gay people really want to change federal law and take on that kind of responsibility? Sure, this generation might get that passed, but have the gays of this generation even begun to fathom what it will do 5, 10, 20 generations from now?


Also, I have observed that most gay couples with children tend to have less stable relationships. They change partners often. They tend to be more violent. And yet these people want to adopt children? Yikes. That's no place to rear an innocent child, imo.


Also, what's with gay people being so easily offended? I understand they've probably been made fun of their whole lives... but the gay folks I know are either super nice (and highly intelligent) or they act super nice but if they feel like you've made a jab at them, even if you didn't, they JUMP all over you and metaphorically rub your face into the ""piss"" that you wrote about them.

They make their gayness seem like it's the #1 important thing in the world. And it's not. Just because I have an opinion on something does not automatically make me wrong. It's an opinion. A voicing. But to have a gay person do that repeatedly makes the rest of the ""gay party"" look like a bunch of misled, masturbating hipsters.

You, as that type of gay person, how the hell do you think I feel as a female? Sure, someone called you out on your tight pants, or shoved you on the train just to be rude. Whatever. I have a vagina. Vaginas have been pushing out mankind for hundreds of thousands of years. We've been vandalized by men for centuries. We're still getting vandalized. Hell, women in 3rd world countries still are struggling for basic rights. Oh, your penis had a bad day? It is mandatory for me to feel sorry for you and take up your cause? Hell no. Didn't think so.


It seems like men + men relationships are taking the nurturing responsibility away from women. Their touting of themselves and their ability to nurture takes away from the female as being the nurturer in the home for a hell of a long time in mankind's history. And that seems wrong. Sperm and sperm don't make babies. Eggs and sperm make babies. You would still need a woman to give that gay couple a child. And what does that leave the mother? A childless mess. Stop taking my ability to nurture away from me and other women.


And the media? They're sensationalizing your cause now, but they will eventually move on and find something more interesting. I'm pretty sure of it.


I probably sound insensitive, or like a troll. But no. I'm a human with feelings of pent-up frustration because I do not understand and it seems gay people just don't want to hear the other party's side of the coin because they're gay. Which is stupid, too.

Please CMV,Exctmonk,64,17,119,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ifz4t/i_am_of_the_opinion_that_the_minimum_wage_is_a/,"I will preface this by stating I'm morally unopposed to the minimum wage. A living wage is a wonderful ideal to strive for.

However, I think it is ultimately going to cost the working class more than help.

The idea lies primarily in automation. I've seen statistics that claim that if wage increase paced productivity, minimum wage should be over 20$. This increase, however, seems to be increasing at a rate that is following the adoption of automation.  Unless someone can explain how we're suddenly more productive people.

Therefore, assuming all corporations worship the bottom line, they would rather automate than hire. The increase of labor costs should make automation a more attractive option. For example, I work for a tech company with a number of sites across the planet, and we hire at least hundreds of people at each site. If the US minimum wage increases beyond a certain point, an automation option that can be rolled out in a few years could be implemented instead, reducing our workforce requirement by 50-66%. In short, minimum wage would kill a number of jobs by turning an expensive automation option into a competitive option.

I think that political correctness limits freedom of speech. I think that everyone should be able to speak their mind without being afraid of offending someone.

Also, I think that people who get offended by other people's ideas are stupid. So what that person doesn't like you? As long as he doesn't hurt you personally I think hate speech shouldn't be forbidden.

Conclusion: Political correctness is bad because it limits freedom of speech and it doesn't allow truth to be born our of the debate. Also I firmly believe it is stupid that so many people today are forced to watch their every word and are often afraid to tell a joke because it's not PC.

CMV",hnnd,66,19,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hq1e2/people_dont_have_any_intrinsic_right_to_their/,"So basically about 8 months ago a found this website and it completely changed my perspective on society and living. Probably the most earth shattering revelation that I had from it is that people do not have an intrinsic right to their children nor a intrinsic duty to take care of them, and that the way all societies are set up is malevolent in the way they abuse children.  

http://forbiddentruth.8k.com

I did not share or even know about most of the ideas on this website until I stumbled upon it by accident. I have now read every essay on it, most of them multiple times. While reading it I kind of felt like I already knew all the points he was making. Since then I have felt like I'm living in a bizarro world and that most humans are mentally deranged for not realizing these things and stopping this horrible cycle of abuse. I'm interested in a discussion with the subreddit and am still open to changing my mind. This is my worldview because it seems obvious to me. Not only about societies but about how to live in general with complete self-love.

I'm going to pasting some text that sums up why I think this. 

""Two human beings of opposite gender agree to have sexual intercourse with each other. This act carries with it the possibility of creating a third, totally separate, distinct, and autonomous life form, as a result of the male sperm and the female egg commingling. Under the deranged doctrine of every society to have ever existed in the Modern Era, those two adults, simply by engaging in a sex act, are officially decreed to be the unquestioned Legal Owners of any and all biological creations that come about as a result of the sex act. Even though they are human beings living in a supposedly civilized, intellect-based society, no attempt is made by either the societal leadership or by societally empowered experts in child welfare, to determine whether or not either one or both of the biological creators desires, deserves, is competent, or has any sort of qualification to be declared the legal owner of a totally helpless child. This core societal reality is one of the most profound, amazing, remarkable, incredible demonstrations of genocidal evil, as practiced by every society on planet earth.

Have you diseased creatures ever watched the cable/satellite channel ""Animal Planet""? If you have, or perhaps on other nature shows on other TV networks, you may well have seen programs in which caged animals at zoos and/or wildlife refuges get pregnant. The pregnant animal-slaves are carefully observed by zoo/refuge staff, and immediately after birth, the observation becomes even more intense. Will the biological creator accept or reject it's offspring?? The staff stands by, watching carefully, ready to rush in and seize the newborn baby animal, if the mother or anyone else in the cage shows any sign of rejecting or hurting the newborn. The fact that your societies would mock and consider ridiculous the notion of mandatory observation and monitoring of human ""parents"" in this manner, is just one of the hundreds of proofs, concrete, undeniable proofs that exist, that you humans and your societies, with utter malice and contempt, deliberately choose to sponsor and cause the genocidal torture and murder of children born into your societies.

Every society on planet earth has the ability to easily stop 98% of all children who are significantly abused, from being abused, if it abandoned it's Sacred Family Unit mythology. Therefore, every society on planet earth, in clinging to and legitimizing Sacred Family Unit mythology, in fact deliberately chooses to commit genocide upon it's own children. Physical, mental, emotional, sexual genocide and murder.""

To the best of my knowledge no society has ever even discussed mandatory parental competency testing. In this essay

http://forbiddentruth.8k.com/childabuse.html

halfway down the author completely lays out a workable solution to this and created a complete parental competency exam, and also describes the way that child homes should be run. The fact that orphanages are in such bad shape in EVERY country in the world just speaks further on how evil human societies are. 

Children are basically sub-human pieces of property in our society. They are used a poison containers for their legal owners. What is a poison container? 

Again pasted 

""The actual original creator of this phrase is, to the best of my knowledge, a psychohistorian named Lloyd deMause. He defines this term, as relates to child abuse, thusly: The Child As Poison Container: The main psychological mechanism that operates in all child abuse involves using children as what I have termed poison containers--receptacles into which adults project disowned parts of their psyches, so they can control these feelings in another body without danger to themselves. Rather than the child being able to use the parent to detoxify its fears and anger, the parent instead injects his or her bad feelings into the child and uses it to cleanse his or herself of depression and anger. End quote. In general, I absolutely agree with this insightful observation and definition of Lloyd's as being accurate. However, I also expand the definition in a broader way, to include all of society, with complete malice aforethought, choosing to genocidally sanction and legitimize the mass torture of children, to allow all citizen-slaves, parents primarily but not exclusively, to ""detoxify"" themselves by torturing the human beings who remind them, consciously or subconsciously, of their own past torment, that society inflicted upon them when they were children. Remember, every adult was once a child, and society has been officially sponsoring and legitimizing the mass torture of all children, throughout the Modern Era of human existence.
Here is an essay by Lloyd deMause where he explains the poison contain in depth and how child abuse has shaped human history.""

http://www.psychohistory.com/htm/05_history.html

I just wanna note that you may think the website's creator is 'nutty' but Lloyd deMause is a very respected psychohistorian.

""Indeed, my conclusion from a lifetime of psychohistorical study of childhood and society is that the history of humanity is founded upon the abuse of children. Just as family therapists today find that child abuse often functions to hold families together as a way of solving their emotional problems, so, too, the routine assault of children has been society's most effective way of maintaining its collective emotional homeostasis.""-------Lloyd deMause

I want to give a quick description of the sacred family unit. Directly quoted from the website: ""The Sacred Family Unit is an artificial societal construct, designed and used by society for the specific purpose of terrorizing, coercing, and brainwashing citizen-slaves into agreeing to emotionally and legally enslave themselves to each other, and in most cases, to cathartically cope with the horrors of life by creating and assuming joint ownership of their own slaves, via procreation. In a nutshell: For the societal purpose of more easily controlling the life paths of all citizen-slaves, they are terrorized and brainwashed into agreeing to pair up into couples, under force of law, and as a reward for agreeing to enslave themselves to each other, society awards them to possess, as complete slaves, all of their biological creations, known as ""children"".

Sacred Family Unit mythology forms a cornerstone, core building block of how societies operate, of how they manage to control, domesticate, and dictate the life paths of virtually all citizen-slaves. The depth and multi-layered complexity of Sacred Family Unit mythology is truly astonishing in scope. Human beings are told that they are ""free"", by so-called democratic societies, and yet the layers of cultural and legal fascism that enchain them as slaves to both society and to each other, the latter via Sacred Family Unit mythology, are literally unbreakable. ""

http://forbiddentruth.8k.com/images/gacy1.gif

""This is John Wayne Gacy, Tortured Victim-Creation of American Society, Murdered by the Most Evil and Diseased Society on Planet Earth. Your society chose to blindly enslave John, as a helpless child, to his sperm creator, who proceeded to engage in the ritual torture of John throughout his childhood, beating him regularly, throwing him across rooms, emotionally terrorizing John by telling him he was a stupid, dumb, sissy. Instead of falling to your knees and begging John to forgive you, you diseased creatures had the audacity to lock him in a cage and then, in May of 1994, to commit the ultimate atrocity, a societally sponsored legal murder, upon this tortured victim-creation of your society. Rest In Peace, John.""

This is an example of how this child abuse and child slavery actually cause society itself to be the creators of those who commit these gruesome types of crimes. 

Sorry if that's long, but I wanted describe this as best I can. Some people seriously become enraged when I bring this stuff up so much so that I now keep most of my real opinions private even when asked. I should note a few things that I will disregard. I'm not doing this to be rude it is or the purpose of saving both mine and yours time. I have discussed with people both in real life and on the internet.

These are just things I'm sick of people annoying me about when I try and discuss this website and the ideas it espouses. I feel they hold ZERO credible argument. 

Any notion that I have committed violent acts or condone it in my personal life.

ANY claim about my personal life

The notion that I 100% agree with EVERYTHING on this website and think it is infallible.

The notion that my worldview makes me immoral. Believe me, I think I'm much more moral than any of you.

The assertion that the creator of the website is mentally ill

The notion that these ideas are 'crazy' and thus not correct.

""OMG Charles Manson's on the front page""

""He called me a creature. How mean!""

The idea that him capitalizing truth and not capitalizing words like god is 'petty'.

The idea of the websites creator calling himself the ""Seer of Forbidden Truth"" is dumb or crazy. Take a good look at your username, I highly doubt it is your legal name.

For the god-freaks out there any reference to the bible will be quickly ignored.

I understand that democracy isn't perfect and that the benefits of denying the right to vote to those with less academic formation, IQ etc pales in comparison to the negative consequences. 

However, I believe the case of the mentally disabled and mentally ill is different in a few regards:

* Many mental illness warp the way you perceive the world around you. Wether it be a delusion or hallucination, these people are, by definition, incapable of interacting and extracting conclusions from the world around them in a realistic way. They may, for example, believe one of the candidates is a reptilian overlord from Mars, without paying attention to his or her policies, just because of their illness.
* Were the person not mentally ill, he or she would probably perceive the world around them in a different manner, with the chance that this may affect their choice of candidate or option at the poll. Is it responsible to let a person make a choice that not only affects himself, but possibly millions, when he or she is under the influence of a disease that could alter the choice he would make were he healthy?
* In the case of the mentally disabled (non-mosaic Down's syndrome with heavy neurological involvement as an example), we're talking about serious mental retardation with an identified, concrete etiology. Their condition, while not involving hallucinations or delusions, does prevent them from grasping the most basic concepts needed to make informed decisions in semi-complex to complex matters. This includes voting. 

I also understand that it would be extremely difficult to legislate this without opening the door to those in power labelling the opponents as ""mentally ill"" and manipulating the system to prevent them from voting. However, I believe that this ""slipper slope"" pitfall can be avoided by restricting the ban to the more severe cases, verified by medical professions with EXTREMELY strict control.

So it is in their best interest to have as many prisoners as they can and have each one cost them as little as they can manage. So, logically, they want many criminals that are convicted of non-violent crimes to be incarcerated at their facilities for as long as possible.

She may have taken a required class or two in a non-STEM field, but she does not take it seriously, nor studies further at a higher level.

The study of the Great Books (classics of philosophy, theology, history, and literature) not only develops ""critical thinking"" skills, but also provides a toolset for students to answer questions like ""What is the meaning of life?"", ""do I love this person?"" and ""Are my actions just?"" These types of questions must be answered (either tacitly through life choices or explicitly through self-knowledge.) None of these questions have an absolute answer, but wrestling with the Greats can provide models to follow and/or elicit self-reflection.

Most folks will get a taste of answering these questions through  religion or wisdom that is passed down from a previous generation.

However, we live in a society that glorifies technical achievements. Admittedly, there is a certain wonder inspired by technology (holy shit, touch pads.) Consequently, STEM-only majors can develop the belief that they are part of the most important questions in our society. Yet, without an exposure to the liberal arts, they lack the sense that there are other questions about politics, morality and the passions that cannot be solved technically. There are also ignorant of the historical horrors when such attempts have been made!

I therefore believe that STEM-only majors are not any better educated  in this broad sense than someone who studies the Bible intently. Worse, they may develop an ego that dulls their curiosity.

Clarifications: I recognize that this is an elitist opinion that is relevant only to those who study at top institutions. I also recognize the importance of STEM education (bridges shouldn't collapse, wordprocessors are wonderful.) However, there is a lack of humility and balance. Finally, liberal arts requirements are important because few, if any, young students know which books are Great. Professors are tastemakers as well as teachers.

Somebody you don't know dies in a car crash. As an absurd last request, he asks that his body be cooked and served by a top chef in a restaurant. One night, your friend (maybe as a joke or something), takes you to this restaurant and buys you a steak of human flesh. It just looks like a steak, and there's no real evidence that it was once a part of a person. Would you eat it?

I would, and I'm a vegetarian. 

What's the big deal? We're a species that eats practically every other species on the planet, often (with the rise of factory farming) causing vast amounts of suffering and pointless death in the process. Do we not eat people because humans are ""more intelligent?"" Does that mean that we can eat retarded people?

1374099303.0,43,self.changemyview,1iimoi,I think increases to minimum wage would INCREASE profits for low margin businesses. CMV.,Khaos1125,53,10,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iimoi/i_think_increases_to_minimum_wage_would_increase/,"Recently, while reading another post, someone stated that low margin businesses couldn't survive an increase in minimum wages, and gave the following 2 numbers.

Typical Grocery store has 1% profit margin.

Typical Grocery store runs a 'sales per labor hour' of $150.

It seems to me though that if this is the case, then if the grocery store is currently paying $10 per hour, and it increased this to $20 per hour, then their 'costs per labor hour' go up just $10.

This means the price of the basket of goods sold in a typical labor hour would have to increase from $150 to $160 to maintain the grocery stores current levels of profitabillity.  **note that I'm not saying they have to sell an extra $10 worth of stuff, I'm saying they need to charge an extra $10 per $150 of stuff.  This corresponds to a small, one time 7% increase in prices.**.

So far then, this shows that for a low margin business such as a grocery store, a 7% increase in prices would allow a $10 per hour increase in the cost of labor, from say, $10 to $20, or from $7.50 to $17.50.

I think that if we had an across the board increase in minimum wage by $10, the following would happen.

1) A dramatic increase in the spending power of minimum wage employees

2) An increase in prices - in this case, 7% for said grocery store, perhaps as high as 20% for other businesses - would allow the businesses to make the same profit per item as before

3) An increase in items sold, due to the general population having more spending money, would increase the overall profits of low-margin businesses.

CMV.

EDIT: created a spreadsheet showing what happens to a supply chain as the cost of labor changes.  It turns out that the 7% number above is understated, however it's also the case that the increase in price is dramatically lower then the increase in wages.  Link here: http://imgur.com/JZwtxFM.  If you want a copy of the actual spreadsheet, pm me.

EDIT2: Note that in the spreadsheet included, I assumed fixed margins for the business, while before, I assumed fixed profit for the business.  EG: If something costs the business $100 to create, and their previous margins are 20%, then they sell it for $120.  If their costs increase to $150 to create, they maintain the 20% margin and so sell it for $180.  This results in LARGER price increases with added steps to the supply chain, and more net profit for the business, assuming the same number of goods sold.  Even with this assumption, price increases still seem to be dramatically less then wage increases.

These people are a drain on the healthcare system, and tie up valuable resources that could be better allocated elsewhere. 

I am one of these people that tied up the resources. I was born with transposition of the great arteries, and while my quality of life has generally been fair, I also consider the heartbreak this has caused my parents and myself. While it's not been fully determined if it's a genetic condition or simply a mutation that occurs in-utero, if given the choice, I wouldn't wish this upon anyone else. 

Science has made remarkable strides in breaking down the genetic code of humans and the maladies the effect us. They can tell us if we carry certain genetic markers for breast cancer (Angelina Jolie recently had a double mastectomy because she tested positive for it), Alzheimer's, and many more. 

I don't believe that eugenics should be employed for desirable traits like skin/eye/hair colour, height, etc. But I do believe that if we can prevent the suffering of millions of people, that eugenics is a positive thing, and should be seriously considered as a viable public healthcare initiative. 

For the record: I live in Canada (if it matters)

Edit 1: If eugenics were to be employed, it would be highly regulated, and only specific genetic markers would be sought. ~~Determining if someone was a risk taker, or had a likelihood of an illness that is manageable and doesn't effect the overall quality of life would not be checked unless specifically requested by the parent. The parents would be able to request a specific genetic marker, or they could test for a list of things from cancers to Alzheimer's.~~ 

~~Additionally~~, the testing of these embryos would ~~*NOT*~~ be government mandated, ~~but would be an option that parents can turn to if they fear that their baby would carry a certain gene~~. I would argue that this should be paid for by your insurance. No one would have access to the records (other than the parents), so insurance companies can't refuse to cover you because you carry a certain gene. 

Edit 2: ~~The government cannot force you to have genetic testing, but they should pay for it if you wish to have it done.~~ They can't compel you to destroy embryos or have an abortion if the embryo/fetus tests positive for something. No one but the parents would know the results.

Edit 3: I started to change what I was trying to say by making it more PC, but then I realized that I was making addendum's that I really didn't believe in. I **do** think that every pregnancy/embryo should be screened, but I **don't** believe that the government can force you to destroy the embryo or have an abortion.

CMV",GooseExtravaganza,55,10,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1i9m2z/i_believe_that_boycotting_the_enders_game_film/,"I've been seeing recently that many people plan on Boycotting the theatrical version of ""Ender's Game"" because of Orson Scott Card's personal vendetta against same-sex marriage. I think this is not only ridiculous, but ultimately more damaging than it is helpful.

The first point I raise is that, while the story was penned by Orson Scott Card, religion is mentioned very little in the story, and same-sex marriage has absolutely nothing to do with it. I could understand if this movie explicitly decried same-sex marriage, but that's not what the story is about.

Second, Lionsgate has personally distanced themselves from Card's views, expressing absolute support for the LGBT community. The large cast and crew of this film, many of whom are looking to see this film do well in order to survive in their professions, should not be punished for the creator's views.

I believe that there comes a time in a place to separate a work of art from the opinions or mistakes of the author. For instance, some of my favorite films are Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown, and The Pianist. Just because they were directed by Roman Polanski doesn't mean I support statutory rape. He made a beautiful piece of art and I enjoy it. It has nothing to do with his personal choices. I don't feel it's the same as, say, paying money to Micheal Vick to watch a dog-fight. I am not personally supporting the crime. 

Third, I believe there are much better ways to protest Card's views. Give donations to charities supporting the LGBT community. Support civil rights legislation.

Ender's Game is a fantastic story that had the misfortune of being written by a man with what are, in my opinion, very skewed beliefs. That doesn't mean the men and women who have worked very hard to bring this work to life share in his sentiments or should be held accountable for them.

Even though many textbooks, writers, and politicians will claim that Democracy is the perfect government system as it ""gives voices to the people"", comparative studies of democratic regimes across the world beg to differ.

If you look at instances in Mexico, Nigeria, or even India, you'll see that even though the people are voting and are choosing their representatives in government (the hallmark of Democracy), these countries are faring much worse than countries such as China—which, despite a totalitarian regime and single party system that squashes all opposition, has had unprecedented growth and economic prosperity under state capitalism and unrestricted government powers and spending. 

Mexico and Nigeria both have huge corruption issues, and because of the extremely slow Democratic process, India has not been able to do much to improve the welfare of its citizens because of Democracy's never-ending debate. Comparing between China and India, it seems obvious that one would rather live under an ""oppressive"" government such as the Communist Party and experience tremendous economic growth, than be a part of an inefficient and corrupt Democracy such as those of India, Mexico, and Nigeria. 

Furthermore, historically, totalitarian regimes under kings and emperors have shown to be the most prosperous. We remember the emperors of Rome and of China, and we learn about incredible English kings. Figures such as King Charlemagne and Emperor Qin Shihuang, among others, show how an autocratic ruler can actually lead a country better than an elected group of politicians can. And to cite the most recent example, Stalin's autocratic rule in the USSR allowed it to match America's power in a matter of a few decades, as opposed to the hundreds of years America took to reach global superpower status.

I understand that in the developed world, countries such as the United States and those in Europe thrive under a well-nourished Democracy. But I do truly think it is overrated and that Democracy isn't for everyone—especially in the developing world.

To summarize,
1. Democracies such as Mexico, Nigeria, and India pale in comparison to the growth, prosperity, and overall living standards of autocratic regimes like China's.
2. Historically, single-party rule and totalitarianism under kings and emperors (even Stalin)—not elected officials—has led to some of the greatest regime successes in human history.

Eventually when I was 10-11 she stopped cooking for both of us and we ate separately, which meant poptarts for dinner for me. She is overweight too and for my entire childhood I didn't think there was anything wrong with being heavy. I knew I wasn't good at sports, but I didn't think that was important.

I know that I am not unique in this situation, and that many parents will encourage their children to overeat or ""clean their plate"" even when the child is full. There are also families in which unhealthy foods are eaten for the majority of meals. I know that many parents ""show their love"" through food with generous portions and tons of unhealthy treats, but I think they are actively harming their child by doing this.

Even in the workplace or on sites like Reddit with plenty of adult members, people who are fat are openly mocked.

* In the twenty-first century, it's become a lot easier to talk about women's issues than men's issues seriously. 
* In most social/legal cases, from child custody to rape, women overwhelmingly get the benefit of the doubt.
* We give more concern to the rights that a woman has to her body, even when it affects a man, than we do to the rights that a man has to his body.
* Sex is less work, more physically enjoyable (more orgasms), and -- for most women -- easier to get.
* There are a lot of double standards against men -- for example, a man who hits a woman is an abusive asshole, whereas a woman who hits a man is just messing around; a man who says he prefers skinny women is sexist, whereas a woman who says she prefers muscular men is not.
* Women have more options when it comes to clothing and style. 
* When emotional problems arise, women are often comforted by society whereas men are cast out.

The consensus, it seems, is that the casual side of hobbies is what has become accepted, and the hardcore side still retains its stigmatic status, because a person becomes hardcore when they are already stigmatized by their inept social skills.

I feel like to reply to stuff now would be mostly pointless since most people don't visit their replies once they are this old. Good discussion though, thanks**

Almost everytime I see debates about programs like food stamps, unemployment, welfare, and so on, the primary concern is the people who are potentially abusing it.  Granted, this is a very valid concern.

Anecdotal experience: I had a roommate who got on food stamps.  They gave him x amount immediately no questions asked.  They said for him to continue getting stamps, he had to jump through a few hoops. One hoop in particular: he had to go to an 8-hour seminar of some kind, which I assume is job-hunt related or something along those lines, but to be honest I am not sure what it was about.  Anyway, he didn't ever go.  He was *that* lazy.  He didn't want to go to a lousy seminar to get free money.

This makes me think.  What would be the harm in taking this concept and expanding on it to weed out some of the leechers and abusers?  Make it be almost as much a pain in the butt to jump through all these hoops like seminars and verifications, etc, to the point that if you are actually **able** to get a job and support yourself, you are more likely to do that vs comfortably living off the government effortlessly.

Example: Unemployment.  I feel that for x amount of time after being laid off, it should be pretty much as it is currently: relatively easy to receive.  But after x time ( **much** less than a year) you will be forced to jump through more hoops to maintain the benefit.  This could include a number of things, but random examples: X hours of community service per week.  X hours per week of attending seminars.  Require proof that you attended x # of job fairs.  Require proof you have taken classes of some kind.  (I am trying to only provide examples.  Please try to avoid nitpicking one of my examples as your entire defense why my idea is stupid)

TL:DR:  Don't deny aid to those who need it.  Simply instead make it where the longer and longer you are on it, the more and more hoops you have to jump through, and time you have to invest into maintaining the benefits.

* Reducing traffic each day, both to the polling place (actual road traffic/parking) and in the polling place (foot traffic, cutting wait times).

* Allowing any difficulties regarding voter eligibility to be sorted out without completely preventing that citizen from voting.  There were a wave of ""voter ID"" laws right before the 2012 elections that were clearly designed to keep ill-informed voters from casting their ballot.  If voting happened over a week, a citizen could try to cast his vote on Monday, be told he lacked proper ID, and come back with it Tuesday.  If he doesn't have ID, he could get the ID reissued on Tuesday and have it before polls closed on Saturday.

* Reduce the effectiveness/raise the expense of polling place squatting.  Most polling centers have a minimum radius that campaign material, including individuals supporting a campaign, can't be posted in.  By spreading a vote out over several days, this makes ""squatting"" more expensive.

1. Having a big expensive ceremony does not improve the quality of a relationship.

2. Signing a piece of paper does not improve the quality of a relationship.

3. The love between two people doesn't get stronger if they wear matching metal rings.

4. Everything is the same, relationship quality-wise, before and after a wedding/marriage. 

5. The trust, respect and the promises between a couple are not stronger simply because you signed a paper and now wear those rings. Your word and your love should be much more important than your autograph and a couple of rings.

So why is marriage still a thing? I know TONS of non-religious people who still love the idea of marriage, weddings, and that actually think it does something for the relationship.

But yeah, I am a fascist. The closest system to my POV is probably Italian fascism, although I do differ in a few ways. That means:

-I believe in state corporatism. That means the state intergrates large corporations into its economical structure, essentially nationalizing sensitive industries (resources, war production being 2 main examples) who are more vital to  state operation than any mom-and-pops industry.

-I believe in national unity. While immigration might or might not be good (Mussolini didn't have a problem with it) assimilation and national unity is a MUST. A nation without a coherent people is bount to allienate itself and, since the government will always try to keep a nation together, it will inevitably create conflict even in the most ""free"" nations (look at Canada for example).

-The state economy should be mixed. That means capitalism should be implemented on the lower industries, but higher industries should be controlled by the state (as detailed above). Worker rights, minimum wage etc would all be in place.

-I differ in politics to the typical fascism in two respects: 

1)I do believe in local municipalities, elections are desirable since politicians are probably fit enough to take care of localized problems. Intervention from above would still be possible, of course, much like it is now in western democracies. 

2)I do not believe in a single ""leader"" for the nation. Even if the original was good, the next might be corrupt and we run into the same problem as any traditional dictatorship. Instead, the council of fascism should hold all the power on a higher level. For those unaware, the council of fascism is a mix of fascist advocates as well as experts on various subjects (eg, international politics, sciences, medicine etc) who generally act as a chamber but are mostly apointed. In this scenario, I would probably support a system much like it currently happens in academia where there are tiers and you get promoted based on expertise and peer approval. In short, the nation should be rule by an expert elite.

I believe this system can be used to best serve a country. I also do not believe a fascist system automatically would mean war in the future. After all, the 30's were....special, to say the least what with a huge economic meltdown and extreme hostility between the countries that existed at the time.

Atheists are a persecuted minority across most of the world, and discrimination against them is a huge problem.

In this thread, I want to talk about those who identify as atheists versus those who identify as theist or even religious.

My essential point here is that there is an intolerable amount of discrimination against atheists in the world, and particularly in a nation like the United States which claims to be the *land of the free*. Most of the discrimination I have listed below is from the USA, but this is because I am an American and I experience it somewhat directly.

* There are **seven** states in the U.S.A. where atheists are not allowed to hold public office (AR, MD, MS, NC, SC, TN, TX). This is blatant discrimination and is just as bad as not letting a certain race or gender vote.

* Most people, especially Republicans, tend to associate atheism with Communism, and so anyone who says they are an atheist is automatically treated like an anti-American ""super liberal"". The truth is that there is nothing that innately connects atheist to one political party.

* There are Islamic countries where atheism is punishable by death.

* If an author or journalist publishes something and mentions that (s)he is atheist, (s)he is then forced to become a sort of flag-bearer for atheism and defend it in the face of religion and theism. We consider religious/theist ""normal"" or ""default"", and we shouldn't. Though many authors choose to write about religion (Dawkins, Harris, Hitchens, Sagan, etc.), there is still an underlying, unspoken 'rule' that if you come out as atheist, you immediately have to give some sort of excuse. People dismiss atheism as a fad among youth or young person's rebellion, when really it is a legitimate viewpoint that potentially relieves one of unhealthy moral reasoning.

The circle-jerking in /r/atheism that *actually is* circle-jerking is when atheists pat each other on their backs for being smarter than everyone else and ""better"" than theists....

However, the circle-jerking on /r/atheism that *is justified* is the majority of it. I believe that there should be a way for atheists to communicate with each other and have a platform for some sort of movement. Not a movement to turn everyone atheist, but a movement to end the discrimination. Right now, atheists are given so little publicity that **/r/atheism is practically the best platform they have**. Sure, some of it is very circle-jerky in that one atheist will upload a predictable quote from Carl Sagan and some other atheist will upvote it pretty much automatically... but no real movement is complete without its share of common-denominator messages that start somewhere and end up being at least somewhat instrumental in initiating a change in people's predispositions to treat each other a certain way.

**TL;DR** ... I'm not saying /r/atheism is the best way for atheists to end discrimination. But it is a very large forum full of atheists who need to support each other because they are a discriminated group. Though the discrimination isn't as tragic as ""separate bathrooms for black people"" or anything like that, it's still embarrassing that we let states be openly anti-atheist and ban them from public office. Most of the circle-jerking in /r/atheism is redundant and maybe a little egotistical, but individuals within the discriminated group, who may not even feel safe coming out as 'atheist' in their real lives, need this sort of thing to remind them that their point of view is not bullshit and to remind them that they don't deserve to be discriminated against.

In [last week's mod thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1e3ab0/mod_post_possible_changes_and_more/), we detailed a list of planned changes for the subreddit. Today, I would like to give a progress report on what changes have been made.  

---  

1) Cleaning up the sidebar  

* STATUS: **DONE** - see the new sidebar!

2) Removal/revamp of TCMV  

* STATUS: **DONE** - see ""TCMV Tuesdays""  

3) Tag threads where OP has not responded yet  

* STATUS: **SOON** - shouldn't be hard, will come in a few days  

4) Require OP to expand their posts/be more descriptive/minimum word count  

* STATUS: **DONE** - check the new ""Submission Rules"" section. We will be enforcing this rule to increase the quality of discussion here.  

5) Tag threads where OP has had their view changed  

* STATUS: **UNDECIDED**

6) Alternatively: tag threads with number of awarded deltas  

* STATUS: **UNDECIDED** 

7) Require mod approval for meta posts  

* STATUS: **DONE** - we have already been enforcing this, but now this is made into a rule.  

8) Reducing repeat/similar questions  

* STATUS: **PARTIALLY DONE** - we're going to be removing submissions if a very similar post has been made within the past 24 hours.  

* In addition, ""Using the wiki page to categorize topics. Possibly add a new mod who could handle this, too."" has been **DONE**. We would like to introduce /u/Joined_Today, who will be our wiki moderator. We will announce when the wiki is ready to be used, and will also link it in the sidebar.  

9) Banning Neutral Posts  

* STATUS: **DONE** - see the new rule in the sidebar, and an explanation for why in the FAQ section.  

---  

So, that's 5 out of 9 changes done. #5 and #6 will be decided on very soon and easily done in one easy fix (stay tuned). #8 is very tricky, though, and is something we have to cautiously decide on.  

Finally, [here are the traffic stats] (http://i.imgur.com/3tQawbp.png) showing our bestof/depthhub link and our most recent influx of subscribers from AdviceAnimals.

I believe that God is more evil than Satan, and that when God or any of his prophets describe himself as ""loving"" or ""good"", or describes Satan as ""evil"", he is simply lying.

It's difficult to find actual examples in the Bible of Satan acting evil, and it seems that nearly every instance which could be described as ""evil"", is more often better described as ""against God"". If God is a character of pure good, then this would be evil, but if actions speak louder than words, there's very little evidence of God being good.

* He's incredibly jealous, and regularly kills followers of other gods.

* He killed who-knows-how-many people with the Flood.

* He once killed 40 kids for calling a guy bald.

* He wants his followers to be willing to kill their own children because he said so. (Sure, he stopped it, but what was this ""test"" supposed to prove?)

* He seems to be totally okay with rape.

Probably a number of more examples that don't come to mind just now. /r/atheism can certainly provide pages and pages. [Here's](http://www.rationalresponders.com/forum/3582) a link with a list and citations.

What has Satan actually done? Sure, he's regularly described as evil, but what evil acts does he actually commit? He got Adam &amp; Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, which is one of those things that falls under the ""against god"" category; I think that knowledge of good and evil is a pretty good thing. He killed Job's family, *with God's complete approval*.

We will need nice, efficient vehicles to drive once everything else is worked out.

I think there is probably a great argument that you'll never break even on the net energy poured into the production of a modern EV, but I want to ignore that aspect.

With our current means of putting energy onto the electric grid, one may very well trade a gasoline powered vehicle for a coal powered one by choosing an EV, and that doesn't make much sense to me.

I will also admit there are some aspects of liberal-arts I disagree with or don’t like but 

I recognize the importance of these topics in our modern society none the less. This feeling of mutual benefit from the sciences and liberals however is not return by others of non-stem affiliation.  It’s as if science and math is viewed as a necessary evil by some only used when necessary. Growing up in school I was lucky to have parents who were both intelligent and physical fit. These genes pass to me so I never had a problem fitting into school but the same couldn’t be said for my fellow colleagues. I remember children have such a hatred for stem topics which I never understood. Science and math are responsible for most of the advancement in human culture which people enjoy but yet many people despise the very thing that give raise to the objects that give them joy. I witness people who had similar scientific appetites as myself, get harass simply for their intelligence and hobbies. It’s just plain feel disgusted when I read headlines like “is Algebra necessary”, “Should non-stem majors be force to take math”, “is too much time spent on math and science education”, etc. 

Even my Philosophy club at University (whose ranks I believe are fill with very intelligent people) seem to suffer from this problem. It’s a very diverse crowd compose of Engineers, Physics, Arts, History, Math, Political Science, and of course Philosophy undergrad, postgrad, and professors. Whenever we discuss economics, politics, or similar topics everyone’s engage and discussing, but when math or sciences topics are being discuss it’s like half the room gets uncomfortable. Yes the stem majors have vivid discussions, but others seem to be frustrated and instead of actively asking questions to try to gain understanding (which many of the stem people do when non-stem topics are being discuss) they just seem to sit there mourn and pout. This as cause lots of friction in the club causing many stem members to leave in protest.

I also see it happening on a national wide level. Quotes like “Scientist are soulless calculating people who done care about others”, “scientist shouldn’t be allowed in politics” comes to mind. Whenever I engage people in topics they become interested and actively hold conversation until I bring math or science into the picture. Whenever I debate people using math, originally rational in our debate, becomes irate, defensive and sometimes express hatred not at me but at the fact that I would include math in our discussion. It’s very frustrating at times because while I recognize the importance of liberal arts in society, the same recognition of sciences and math is not return. Look at our so call role models and heroes. Sports players, reality TV stars, actors, etc.  Where’s the mention of Neil Degrasse or Stephen Hawking? This really gives me a grim outlook on the future of our society in the upcoming years.

1374605009.0,40,self.changemyview,1iwg2u,Left-wing parties and policies are better for the economy than right-wing parties and policies. CMV,acid_wash_farts,55,15,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1iwg2u/leftwing_parties_and_policies_are_better_for_the/,"My view on this was formed years ago when I did some research and found that in my country, Canada, the right-wing party has historically not done very well when it comes to balancing the budget.  Upon further
research, I found that historically both Canada and the US do better economically (measured by stock market growth, GDP, and debt) when their left-wing party is in power.  

I had some theories about why this was the case, which was all crystallized when I watched [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBx2Y5HhplI) (removed from TED talks for being ""too political"").  The essential idea is that when the poor and middle class have more money, they're more likely to spend it than rich people, which pushes the economy forward.  With the economy moving faster, this increases tax revenue and helps left-wing governments to balance their budgets better than right-wing governments.  This flies in the face of the right-wing rhetoric about balanced budgets, but it is confirmed by the historic data:

[Charts showing Canadian debt, colour coded to political party](http://wpmedia.news.nationalpost.com/2011/03/gdp.jpg).  Careful reading that chart, in Canada the rightwing party is blue and the Central party (further left leaning than Democrats) is red

[TSX performance, linked to Canadian political party in power](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/650719/TSX%20performance%20by%20political%20party.png)

I haven't been able to find all the Canadian resources I've seen on this, that last one I had to recreate myself, but you can check the data [here](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/markets/stocks/chart/?q=tsx-I) and [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Prime_Ministers_of_Canada)

I know I'll be questioned about correlation vs. causation, I've been critiqued in comments saying that maybe the effects of one party's policies are only observable in the subsequent term.  But if you look at the charts, the big economic moves only happen 2-3 years into a party's term.  So changes made at the beginning of a term are only observable 6-10 years later?  Or in Canada's case, where we have no term limits, sometimes 10-12 years later?  

Certainly there are many variables at play here, like the most recent market crash that was the results of many years of failed banking policies and wouldn't necessarily be attributed to the party in power.  But the correlation is strong, stretching over a long period of time, and in two separate countries, which makes me think it transcends outlying variables like that.  

I have looked, and haven't been able to find meaningful stats for other countries.  Aside from the US, it looks like you have to actually find and interpret the economic data yourself to learn anything about historic patterns as they relate to left/right wing policies.

I believe that having *access* to healthcare is a right. That no government should deny you the right to procure it. 

However, I do not see it as a right in the sense of right to free speech, self defense, freedom of assembly etc etc are rights. More or less that rights are abstract things, and not material items. Excluding things like right to property, ability to procure property, etc etc. 

I find it abhorrent the idea healthcare should be paid for by the point of a gun, and not of their own labor. What I mean by this is that when I hear ""health care is a right and should be provided by the government"", I see it as, ""I think the government should tax other people, and take their money by force if necessary, to pay for my healthcare.""

I can understand the view of, ""its just the right thing to do."" Which is fine if you personally want to do such, but it becomes morally suspect IMO once you force others to provide that charity.

1373305357.0,39,self.changemyview,1hvk7s,I believe dating is unequal and heavily favors women. CMV,jfgdjfgh,94,55,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hvk7s/i_believe_dating_is_unequal_and_heavily_favors/,"I was previously ignorant of gender inequalities and relations and after reading a ton of /r/askwomen, /r/askmen, /r/datingadvice, and /r/relationships in the past couple months I fear I have grown to hate women, or at least their modern behavior and social roles.

I don't want to feel this way because I can't just hate 3.5 billion people but when it comes to the dating world I feel quite jaded by the endeavour.

So, if, for example, I meet a women and wish to pursue a relationship with her, I have to make the first move. Then, should the women choose to accept me, I have to offer a date place and time. Then, in most situations, I have to pay because it was my idea and it would be rude to ask someone to pay for something I invited them to. The money isn't that big of a deal though and feminists usually offer to go dutch so that's nice.

After that, I'm expected to call and say it was fun, and then plan the next date. During the dates I often feel like I have to carry the conversation because a lot of women are shy so I have to ask questions about their lives while strategically inserting information regarding myself every once in a while so the conversation doesn't feel so one-sided.

After that, if we want to move to sex, I have to initiate. Then the performance begins. I have gently kiss her, move my lips down to her neck, giving attention to all parts of her body, caressing her, massaging her, and providing ample foreplay. Then, after enough aussies, she is thoroughly relaxed and penetration can begin. Thus begins a half an hour of tiring cycling of positions of thrusting while she just sits there and maybe moans every now and again. I barely even enjoy myself and she has multiple orgasms.

I don't understand how so many women can say they'll break up with a partner if they don't go down on them. Women expect men to do all the work in the bed (overwhelmingly they prefer a dominant partner) yet when it also benefits them for their man to be temporarily submissive by performing cunninglingus it is required. Instead of saying you want a dominant partner why not just say you want one that does all the work? If a women is submissive and a man dominant in a relationship, I think it's completely equal  if the man recieves oral and the woman doesn't. Obviously if the man likes giving oral that's his prerogative but I reject reddit's consensus that a man not reciprocating oral with oral is somehow unfair, like all other acts in and out of the bedroom mean nothing.

Another thing that bothers me is when women say they just wanted to be treated like a person, or how we treat other guys. No you don't. I have tried this and it does not work. Men are vulgar to each other and fight. My friends and I constantly talk shit on each other and jokingly reinforce every stereotype when we're doing a commentary on shows we're watching, for example.

Men have to constantly censor themselves and their behavior when trying to get with a women. That's why you feel like you are objectified, because you are. I, and most men, cannot act like I do around my friends as I do you because you would be repulsed. You know how when women have a problem they want empathy, reassurance, compassion, and the such from their boyfriend? I'm listening to you and your problems and just cycling through ""I'm sorry to hear that"", ""I can't imagine how hard that must be for you"", and ""Let me know if I could do anything to help."" If a guy friend came to me with a problem I treat him like a person and we try to collaborate to fix it. If you want to be egalitarian you need to be it on all fronts, and not only on ones that benefit women.

Men in general do not feel desired by women. Men buy the gifts, make the dates, and put themselves out there while the women, from her pedestal, wish men would stop putting her on pedestals. We have to constantly reassure you that you're beautiful, not fat, not crazy, etc. while all of men's emotions are completely ignored for that of the women's. Women get annoyed by physical compliments while most men have never even been complimented or can at least count on one hand the amount of times. Even in a relationship it often feels like you're not even physically attracted to us but just likes what we can do for you.

Anyways, by now you must think I'm some old MRA, bitter, and alone. I'm actually 20 and have pretty much kept all of this in my head and never let in manifest in any way. I try to be a good person and have had great and fulfilling relationships. Don't think I'm also not aware of the problems women face and how they are discriminated against. I'm aware many can only get off through clitoral stimulation, that they are only viewed as sexual creatures and seldom seen for their intelligence, and preyed against sexually, in the workplace, and society. I feel such cognitive dissonance because gender relations are so complicated and changing every day and there is so much inequality and discrimination on both sides that I'm aware of that it's hard to just shut off and recognize most people try to be good. I just really hate how disproportioned it seems to be in the dating world.

The more we learn about the human brain, the more we learn that, in the end, it's all just chemistry.

We don't understand the system, but we understand its components, and we find nothing special in these components that would suggest that the chemistry in our brain provides us with any more free will than that possessed by a tree. Or a rock. ""After all, there is no spot in the brain that is not densely interconnected with—and driven by—other brain parts. And that suggests that no part is independent and therefore “free.” In modern science, it is difficult to find the gap into which to slip free will—the uncaused causer—because there seems to be no part of the machinery that does not follow in a causal relationship from the other parts.""

I used to think that this meant that given sufficient information we could predict anything and everything - thus truly putting the kibosh on the idea of free will - but apparently quantum mechanics blows the idea of a deterministic universe out of the water.

Noun
1. A secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful.
2. The action of plotting or conspiring.

I think the evidence of George W. Bush lying to the American public about why we invaded Iraq is pretty obvious. To the point to where I immediately disregard the opinions of people who can't seem to piece together the logic and see that it was a lie and that there were ulterior motives at play. I'm not here to get opinions on that topic, I've reviewed the evidence already and my mind is pretty much closed on the topic now, barring some major evidence I may have missed. However, if I'm going to be a rational human being, I need to accept the fact that this means a number of things.

1. A conspiracy, by definition, took place in the highest, most publicly scrutinized of offices in the entire country.

2. There was an entire power base that was supposedly ideologically opposed to those in office and had a vested interest in outing their corruption.

3. The evidence for the conspiracy is so widely known in our culture that it has become a running joke and a go-to gag/topic among stand-up comics and pundits.

4. There has been zero accountability, either in the media, the courts or any other agency/group that has any power to do anything about the matter. The topic, although largely known, isn't taken seriously at all. Even the next administration, which had a strong political incentive to do serious political damage to their opponents by outing the conspiracy, not only did nothing to hold anyone accountable, but actively urged the public to ""move on"" and put it out of their minds.

So the problem I have is that it seems to me that people who seem to get that Bush was lying to get us into a war also seem to be the people(in my experience, I'm not trying to state this as a universal truth) that are the most resistant to believing that other conspiracy theories have any validity whatsoever. This seems very hypocritical to me.

Please explain to me what I'm missing.

On a side note, I'm not sticking up for any particular conspiracy theory, so please don't assume that I am. I don't buy the vast majority of them, but that's because I've analyzed the evidence before I made my decision, not because I refused to take it seriously in the first place. I also understand that some people that believe Bush was lying are also open minded to other conspiracies, I'm not referring to those people.

It's a [Barnum statement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect), written from the lens of a self-proclaimed introvert. In reality, even the most outgoing and sociable people I know need time for themselves. I've seen archetypically extroverted people classify themselves as introverts and ambiverts after having heard definitions like these. People who would rather spend every waking moment around other people are most certainly a miniscule minority.

I believe that the concept of introversion of extroversion tries to reduce a wild amalgamation of quaquaversal traits to a single nonexistent entity. For example, I prefer casually spending time at the computer over casually hanging with friends. Not because I'm an introvert, or because I prefer the *aloneness*, but simply because my wide array of interests on the computer is more enjoyable than aimlessly spending time with my friends; someone else will do the opposite due to the same factor, and get branded an *extrovert*. And both of us will go out on Saturday and want to spend time alone on Sunday.

I believe that the extraversion–introversion trait is a mere [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory), an [essentially contested concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentially_contested_concept). Ergo, you don't qualify as an extrovert because you fulfill criteria *1*, *2* and *n*; you qualify *more* as an extrovert because you're *closer* to the average view of an extrovert. Subsequent attempts to put clear-cut definitions for the traits are just arbitrary explanations of prior gut feelings.

Now of course, I understand that the concept is intended to be more of a convenient description than an infallible, innate spectrum, but as long as subordinate factors and traits can fall into both opposite sides of the spectrum, it's effectively useless, while the definitions themselves are poor representations of reality.

Also, I got the idea for this CMV from /u/babycakesss when he made a CMV post concerning the topic of transsexuals.

I believe this is pretty self-explanatory. I think the vast majority of homosexuals aren't homosexual because they were born that way, but because they chose it. Their reasons for choosing it could be due to a number of different reasons ranging from sexual abuse at a young age to boredom to reasons that I can't understand.

If homosexuality is *not* a choice, then wouldn't it be considered a mutation? (I admit that this statement is a weak point in my argument and may be wrong.)

And if it's a mutation, is it very likely that ~10% of the population was born with a such a mutation? Or is it more likely that homosexuality is not something that one is born with but is instead due to that person's experiences and observations in life?

Again, I'm not trying to be disrespectful by labeling homosexuality as a mutation. Please Change My View, Reddit! :D

That's probably why I shouldn't start a debate after midnight. ;D If I were to do it over again, I would say debate the *cause* of homosexuality. Is it nature or nurture? Genetic mutation or environmental interference? And it seems the general consensus is that no one is completely sure. I'm leaning more toward environmental interference, but /u/TRAIN_INSANE made a good point when he said:

&gt;There is strong evidence that homosexuality is not a choice. For example, there is the presence of homosexual behaviors in animals. Animals have no society to pressure them, if homosexuality was driven by society, why would animals display homosexual behaviors? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_displaying_homosexual_behavior

If what he said is true (and it is to a certain extent b/c sexually confused dogs that I witnessed at a young age) then that could mean that it *isn't* society and environmental interference.

I have had relationships with men and consider myself bisexual.  I DON'T believe it is a choice.  Now for the discussion.

I don't believe there is enough evidence to say with any real certainty that people are 'born' gay in the biological sense.  My main reason for thinking this involves a bit of history.

Look at ancient Rome and ancient Greece.  In these societies, homosexuality and bisexuality were much more widely accepted notions, and **significantly** more than 4% of their populations (the percentage of people who identified as gay in modern America in 2008) were openly gay or bisexual.  Some high class men of their eras were even considered to have taboo sexual tastes because they only were attracted to females.

I think a fair definition of homosexuality (or bisexuality) in the modern sense is this: having frequent feelings of sexual attraction to people of the same sex (or both).  Seeing as how societies across the world differ greatly in the proportions of their populations that are homosexual (very strongly correlated to social acceptance of the act), homosexuality can't possibly be genetic.  It hasn't been scientifically proven either (though I'd appreciate some more studies to look at if you have them).

That being said, I believe that homosexuality and bisexuality are psychological conditions (NOT diseases and NOT choices), and are not genetic.

The objective field seems superfluous to me. The objective is ""get a job at your company"" no matter how it's dressed up as far as I'm concerned.

We have acres of land right now that cannot be used to build schools, or hospitals, or..anything really, simply because people cannot let go of their loved ones decomposing, lifeless bodies. So they are left in the ground and now that ground is no longer usable.

Further I think the manipulation involved in funerals, (don't you want them to have a nice casket? Wouldn't you like the pillow, so you know they're truly resting in peace? etc.), especially when used on religious, spiritual, and vulnerable people in their most vulnerable position is abhorrent. 

We are in a day and age where we know the dead don't need their bodies, ESPECIALLY if you are religious or spiritual, (I am not, which is perhaps why I feel the way I do), and getting rid of the remains should not be viewed as disrespecting the dead.

I really don't like the men's rights movement at all, so that's not where I'm coming from. I recognize that females are raped more often than men, I recognize that rape is of course a problem, but I don't like the term rape culture at all. I'm fully willing to have my view changed on this if someone could definitively tell me exactly what rape culture means, because I've never gotten a clear answer, and attempts to look around the internet yield completely different definitions.

From what I've seen and researched, rape culture seems to mean a culture in which rape is normalized, such as where jokes about rape are normal and accepted. Maybe it's a culture where rapists routinely don't get caught. Okay so for the normalization point, I don't see how rape is normalized at all. When a rapist is arrested, I see a ton of comments on those news stories about how the rapist should be castrated and inflicted with other horrible punishments. People who believe in rape culture say that rape victims are often blamed by society, but I don't see that happening as much as they say. Look at the Steubenville case. Sure a few assholes blamed the girl for getting drunk, but the large majority of America was shocked that this happened. So I'm just not understanding why the term rape culture is needed to describe a few assholes, because assholes will always exist.

Some even say that rape culture exists because we have to warn women that rape is a possibility and we give them basic protection tips like don't go out alone at night. Well we give basic protection tips like this to everyone to protect themselves from all sorts of crimes. We tell people to lock their doors. That doesn't mean we have a stealing culture, we just understand that some people do want to steal your things and you should protect yourselves from them.

My disgust shouldn't give me the right to stop 2 consenting (albeit weird) people from doing what they want.

The second category is the increased risk of genetic diseases argument. For me this falls down for the same reason that I don't agree with eugenics.

Now, because people can live with these weaknesses, I believe those working in medicine will have to constantly update their treatments as the human race gets ""weaker"" in the sense that these faulty genes (technically mutations) are being allowed to pass throughout the generations when they would have normally died off due to natural selection.

Up until the early 20th century, Congress regularly increased the size of the house so that Congress would have small enough constituencies such that they could actually, you know, *represent* the people in their districts. 

That practice stopped to deflate the power of cities--and quell anti-immigrant fears, yet it also means that today, some congressmen and women cover six-figure populations, and others five-figure, without any difference in their power in government. 

My view is that smaller constituencies would create more incentive for politicians to really help local communities rather than spend their time worrying about being re-elected, and it would deflate the power of extreme districts with small populations to create the 'tyranny of the minority' we've seen recently. 

I'd like the ideas of [this op-ed]
(http://www.npr.org/2011/01/24/133184399/Op-Ed-America-Needs-A-Larger-Congress) with a one-to-60000 ratio for representation. This would significantly swell the size of congress leading to my only problem: implementation. Would we increase the size of the Capital? Find a secure, online voting resource? It's tough , but I think that's a lesser issue than looking at the fundamental benefits of better representation. 

When political dysfuntion becomes as prevalant as it is now in the United States, I'm inclined to look at systematic problems: where are these issues coming from? My view is that it comes from disproportionate representation of the views of the citizens.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract

Context:
Lack of individual consent with respect to government &amp; policy

Everything Elizabeth Warren does

My Reasoning:

1) It is impossible to have a valid contract without the explicit, voluntary consent of all parties involved. 

2) It is impossible for an individual or group to give or decide what constitutes consent for any person other than themselves.

3) Consent can never be implied. It may be reasonable to make the assumption, for example, that an injuried person would consent to first aid or medical care. There is no guarantee. In some cases it may also be reasonable to assume that the extent of a persons injuries are so severe that they would not consent to treatment because it would leave them in a vegetative state, crippled, maimed, or worse. 

4) Majority does not rule. If I stand on a street corner with 9 of my friends and we all vote that every person who passes by must pay each of us $10 it does not make it right. Even if we say that your pressence on the corner implies that you consent to the toll. Even if we say ""If you don't like it go to another street corner""

5) Taking all or a portion of the fruit of someone else's labor without their consent is theft. Saying you are owed all or a portion of someone else's labor without their consent is slavery.

CMV,Betadyne,58,22,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1houdl/i_find_relationships_insufficiently_rewarding_for/,"Firstly, basing it off my parents. My dad is a typical salaryman, IT industry. My mom is a housewife. I'm so grateful to them for bringing me and my siblings up, but at the same time I feel family life has sapped a lot of their intellectual curiosity. I confess I'm afraid of ending up like them.

Secondly, I'm at the point in life where I'm discovering the vastness and beauty of the world. Holy crap physics is beautiful. Oh my god computers are such incredibly complex things; you could devote your entire life to exploring only one aspect of it. Wow economics isn't as dismal as people say it is; it's how we try to solve resource scarcity; money isn't paper or evil, it's a promise. Math, don't even get me started. The genius behind those proofs are just incredible. Psychology, sociology, biology, chemistry. Philosophy, art, culture, travel. I have what, 60 years remaining to savour it all as much as I can, if I'm lucky; companionship seems so trivial in comparison. I have places to go, things to do. I cannot see myself ever settling down. The opportunity cost seems massive.

The cost of a relationship seems very high too. Aside from the intellectual price, there is the time you have to devote to things like watching twilight because she likes it, or talking about emotions, socialising to find a suitable mate, buying presents, just general interaction. There's the monetary cost of supporting a spouse, possibly kids, and constructing a safe environment for them and position them to succeed in life. I just find the cumulative cost to be not worth the happiness it might generate.

Third, I hate conflict. I come from a very stable family, and my parents made it a point never to argue in front of the kids. But as my friends get into relationships, I'm beginning to realise that conflict is incredibly widespread. I can deal with conflict at the friendship level, but at the relationship level the emotional investment makes everything so much more serious, and I don't enjoy that.

Fourth, I'm becoming quite cynical about romantic love. Came across this idea by the philosopher Slavoj Zizek, he says that love is an evil thing; you draw an arbitrary circle around a person or group of people and say, I choose to love them more. I find that quite true and irrational; to a large extent I feel love is a meme largely supported by the biochemical cocktail our brains deliver during attraction and arousal. All that stuff about it being complex and multi-faceted is just a result of cognitive dissonance. I get that it's a practical rationalisation for reproductive success, and having experienced it I don't deny that it is deliciously addictive; I just can't take the popular idea of romantic love seriously.

Finally, I had a girlfriend once. It was sweet and I think we might have worked out, but she went to chase her dreams and I went to chase mine, and a LDR later we realised we were holding each other back. We were never unhappy, but we weren't as happy as we could have been. And honestly, I did a stupid thing and offered to give it all up for her, and she was smart enough to decline; on hindsight it might have killed me, figuratively speaking. I can't allow myself to have the motivation to try stunts like that ever again.

Also, holy crap the clarity of thought you get after a relationship is like putting on glasses for the first time. Everything you've ever done that you wondered why would you do that(insert jacky chan meme here), you figure out when freed from the emotional shackles.

It grates on my nerves that people are constantly telling me to start dating again, that marriage is bliss and solitude is evil, and all you should ever want is a house, wife, kids, stable income, car, big nest egg and credit cards. They are nice to have, but there's so much more to life. Nevertheless, I'm still young(sort of), and only one human representing one error-prone perspective.

You can read the previous Mod Post by clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1d49yq/mod_post_we_want_your_feedback_on_popular/), or by visiting the [Mod Post Archive](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/modpostarchive) in our wiki.**  

---

The Reddit admins have (literally just) implemented a new feature that allows a subreddit to hide comment scores for a set period of time.  

I think admin Deimorz goes into good detail about it here: http://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/1dd0xw/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/  

Now, what we want to hear from you all are the following:  

1) Should we implement it?  

2) If we do implement it, how long do you think we should set the limit?  

---  

Some things to consider (for anyone who is confused by the post by Deimorz):  

1) Voting still affects which responses rise to the top. *Clarification*: the ""best"" posts by vote count will *still* show up on top, but with this change you just won't be able to see *how many* votes got them there. For example, the top post in a thread may have 2000+ upvotes while the second highest post may have only 20 upvotes. With this change (at least until the time limit is reached), you will not be able to tell by how much the first post outscores the second post. Even so, all posts are not ""weighted"" equally in this instance. The top post will still be the top post, and the second top post will still be the second top post.  

The purpose of this is to make the vote count no longer visible and thus limit how much people vote based on others' votes.  

2) This will level the playing field between users who keep the CSS enabled and users who don't keep the CSS enabled/are on mobile devices. The problem we had before when we ""hid"" the downvote arrow using a CSS trick was that it had no affect on the latter two categories. This is a site wide change that will fix that problem, however.  

3) You will not be able to tell how people are voting against you, at least when you are looking at strings of child comments. Parent comments that are downvoted will still tend to be towards the bottom, though these comments may also just have neutral vote counts.

---  

As always, Rule III is not in effect for mod posts. Please discuss and help us decide if this is a good option or not for /r/changemyview!

I know quite a lot of people with this condition and this is the conclusion I have reached.

Transsexuals say that their main issue is they feel like they are trapped in the opposite gender's body- that their mind is male and their physical vessel is female or vice versa.

I'm a male, but I don't *feel* like a man- I feel like me. I don't like doing *man* things, I like doing the things I like to do. I have facial hair and a penis, but they are not integral parts of who I am, because an individual is more than the meat they walk around in.

What does it mean to have a male or female brain? I've met women that were more stereotypically masculine in their thinking (aggressive, ambitious, domineering) than many men, and men that were more stereotypically feminine (nurturing, sensitive, caring) than many women. I think transsexuals are emotionally immature and as a result attach disproportionate salience to superficial gender constructs. Plenty of feminine men live their lives without wanting to chop off their penis and vice versa. 

What would happen if I woke up tomorrow with a woman's body? It would be pretty shocking and my life would change radically as a result, but I don't think it would make me miserable. I would still be *me*, just in a different body.

Well, I definitely know I'm wrong and that's why I'm here. This post is going to sound terrible and I really want to apologise if I'm offending anyone. I'm trying to change my view here and if you have anything to say, please say it.

Part of me knows men can be raped by women. Because you know, it's fairly obvious. If men don't give their consent and women have sex with them anyway = rape. Simple as that. 

But for the most part I'm just really confused. I'm having trouble coming to terms with how it's possible for women to rape men. Does it hurt men physically to be raped (no bondage/drugs/alcohol involved)? I sound like one of those legitimate rape Republicans here, but if a man is being raped by a woman, why can't he just... enjoy it? I know it's a terrible view and again I want to apologise, but does it physically hurt men to be raped by women (as in PIV sex)? Although I'm aware that it would be emotionally damaging... Back to my whole ""enjoy it"" point, if you flip it around, I'm MORE than aware that it would be absurd to say to women victims that they could've just enjoyed it. 

I think the main part of my view comes from that I've always seen men portrayed as sex maniacs, always thinking about sex, always wanting it, etc. I mean I have male friends who I've spoke to about this who believe men can't be raped too (they deemed it ""ridiculous""). I also remember seeing a tweet on one of those true fact accounts on Twitter. The tweet said something along the lines of a man was raped at knife point by five women (his wives? Can't really remember but it doesn't matter right now). A few of the comments were guys going ""what a way to go!"" and ""sounds good"" and just general positive comments. So I guess this also contributed to my view that guys always want sex and therefore can't be raped.

I was considering posting this to /r/mensrights but figured I'd come here first.

I know people who think like I do are part of the problem. So CMV please. My opinion is making me uncomfortable.

For example: premeditated murder, breaking into someone's house to rape someone, kidnapping and sexual assault/molestation, armed robbery where victims are tied up and beaten. In my opinion, perpetrators of these crimes have shown themselves to be violent in a planned and premeditated way that cannot be rehabilitated. Basically if you plan to commit a violent crime (as opposed to committing a violent crime of passion), you're done. Off the streets. Once you've shown that kind of behavior, you should be removed from society. Period. We all know that those crimes are wrong, and there's no excuse for letting perpetrators of these crimes back on the streets. 

Things I would not include in this: heat-of-the-moment murders, manslaughter (or involuntary murder), larceny, date rape without evidence of drugging, to name a few. 

To address prison over-crowding, I think drug possession charges should be dropped and those convicted released, unless they were dealing at a high level and/or committed a violent crime while high. But simple possession and low-level dealing should be dealt with through rehab, not prison. 

On the one hand, I feel this is sort of draconian, but on the other hand, I think it's a much more practical use of our prison system that would make society safer. CMV. Thank you.

Edited: Removed an extra word that was confusing.

Edit 2: Clarifications.

By life-altering, I meant that this should cover emotional distress and trauma short of killing someone. If a child is kidnapped and molested, that follows him or her the rest of his or her life. It affects one's sense of safety, of healthy relationships, etc. You don't have to kill someone to permanently mess up their life. I used the term ""life-altering"" to cover this, though perhaps it's not the best way of expressing what I'm thinking of. Basically if you plan to commit a crime that either kills someone or permanently fucks up their life, you lose the privilege of being part of society.

I specifically excluded that kind of date rape because I feel like that's much more of a gray area in terms of premeditation. If you drug someone and rape them, you planned that.

When I see these videos, I just can't help but feel that everything they show is rehearsed and that it wouldn't work in a real life situation.  
[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CusoFfBmTWU) another video I saw. In the video, the ""victim"" is on the ground and the ""attacker"" is standing. The instructor explains what a person should do in such a situation: keep your knees up, track the attacker, and kick. But if you notice, at 1:42, when the attacker goes around, it's just so rehearsed and slow! In a real situation, someone on the ground would not be able to turn as fast as a person can run on their feet. And once the attacker is close to the victim's head, he can kick/stomp.  
Also, the video *assumes* that the attacker will want to get close to the victim's head, but that might not always be the case. The attacker could just stay in one place and kick the victim back. And if the attacker is standing, his kicks will have a lot more power than the victim's, who is on the ground.

1372775167.0,35,self.changemyview,1hhxrp,"I don't really agree with Richard Dawkins's ""meme theory"". CMV.",Gehalgod,49,14,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hhxrp/i_dont_really_agree_with_richard_dawkinss_meme/,"In Chapter 11 of *The Selfish Gene*, Richard Dawkins introduces us to the idea of *memes*.

Dawkins suggests that these *memes* are like the genes in the primordial soup of human culture. This means that they are self-replicating cultural ideas (tunes, phrases, methods, etc.).

Dawkins posits the existence of these *memes* in order to give us an explanation (via mechanisms that were well-established earlier in the book when talking about genes) of why humans are ""special"" in comparison to other species. We have culture, and this culture provides the primordial soup in which memes replicate.

The view sounds attractive because it allows us humans to carry on thinking of ourselves as ""better"" than other species without ever leaving behind the idea of complexity arising only through evolution by natural selection. We get to have it ""both ways"".

But the idea breaks down for me due to a few things. A couple of them are excerpts from Dawkins himself where he expresses some doubt (page numbers taken from the 30th anniversary paperback edition):

**1. Page 193:**

&gt; The survival value of the God meme in the meme pool results from its great psychological appeal. It provides of superficially plausible answer to deep and troubling questions about existence.

&gt; ...

&gt; Some of my colleagues have suggested to me that this account of the survival value of the god meme begs the question. In the last analysis they wish always to go back to 'biological advantage'. To them it is not good enough to say that the idea of a god has 'great psychological appeal'. They want to know *why* it has great psychological appeal. Psychological appeal means appeal to brains, and brains are shaped by natural selection of genes in gene-pools. they want to find some way in which having a brain like that improves gene survival.

**2. Page 194-5**

&gt; This brings me to the third general quality of successful replicators: copying-fidelity. Here I must admit that I am on shaky ground. At first sight it looks as if memes are not high-fidelity replicators at all. Every time a scientist hears an idea and passes it on to somebody else, he is likely to change it somewhat. I have made no secret of my debt in this book to the ideas of R. L. Trivers. Yet I have not repeated them in his own words. I have twisted them 'round for my own purposes, changing the emphasis, blending them with ideas of my own and of other people. The memes are being passed on to you in altered form. This looks quite unlike the particulate, all-or-nothing quality of gene transmission. It looks as though meme transmission is subject to continuous mutation, and also to blending.

I feel as if this lack of copying-fidelity combined with the worries of Dawkins's colleagues expressed on page 193 gives us too much doubt for this theory of *memes*.

Besides this lack of high fidelity in copying, we should also consider why these *memes* have merit in the first place. They (probably) have merit to us because they assist the replication of our genes. Now, I'm not saying that just because the replication of memes depends on the replication of genes, it means that memes automatically shouldn't be considered replicators. Two different selfish replicators can have a mutual relationship.

I don't think Dawkins is necessarily wrong when he says that our genes' survival machines (namely our bodies) provide the primordial soup in which memes can replicate. This idea seems to be explained well enough in the book. However, I just don't think we've *seen* enough evidence that these memes are actually replicating, let alone for *their own good*, the way genes replicate.

My personal gripe with the meme theory ultimately boils down to the questions that arise when we try to decide what counts as ""one meme"". For instance, when we consider an idea in science, we might say that the specific language used by the discoverer to express the idea is somewhat irrelevant. The language is a vehicle for the idea to merely be passed to the next generation. It's the unexpressed ""idea"" that is competing with others for brain space, and the language one expresses it in is a secondary feature.... But, you see, it's *not* a secondary feature. Not really. The survival of the meme depends on how well one generation can express it to the next. The language skills and whatnot of one generation determines how well the ""meme"" will do... it's not all up to the meme just to replicate itself. I think Dawkins is contradicting himself a bit here.

Dawkins defines one gene as ""one replicator"" or ""one unit of natural selection"", which allows him not to have to deal with the specifics of whether a certain gene ""for"" a trait is really one gene or not. He writes the definition he likes and then says that one gene is whatever the unit is which performs that function. This seems plausible to me when talking about genes but not with memes.

If we are to judge what ""counts"" as a meme, we have to admit that it's a bit fuzzy when it comes to certain musical and scientific ideas. Every generation of memes is going to be drastically twisted and altered from the original form, maybe sometimes not even fully recognizable to all as a form of the ""old meme"". But what determines how much it is ""okay"" for a meme to differ from its parent generations? It seems the answer is that it's ""okay"" for a meme to be different as long as we still like it and will still pass it down... for the good of the survival of our own genes. It feels wrong to say that memes are self-replicating units if their survival depends on so much more than longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity as we've seen with genes. Instead of saying that memes are ""competing"" for brain space, it seems that humans are ""competing"" for that which will help the survival of our genes. And since we are highly evolved, these resources include ideas and knowledge of certain methods as well.

tl;dr -- I disagree with the meme theory of Dawkins based on the idea that we don't have enough conceptual evidence to say that memes are really units of natural selection or units with any sort of copying-fidelity that we find in genes. The survival of a meme does not depend merely on its ability to copy itself.

I say this because I believe in democracy and the rule of law.  I do not say this because I believe in PRISM, or because I don’t value my right to privacy – I do.  But Snowden broke the law in a serious and dangerous way.  

We live in a representative democracy.  The people have elected legislators and Presidents who have enacted laws establishing a system for classifying and declassifying information.  You may not like this system, I happen to think its necessary to some extent (though clearly it has been inappropriately overused) – but my feelings about the system are irrelevant to my argument.  The system was created and repeatedly endorsed by the election and re-election of members of Congress and Presidents.  It has been upheld by the judiciary.  

No private citizen has the right to unilaterally decide the law shouldn’t apply to them, or that their opinion of the world is more valid than others.  We don’t let individual citizens decide which specific programs their tax dollars should support, and we don’t allow individual citizens decide to declassify secret information.  There are good reasons for this.  I doubt anyone here would care to defend the leakers in the Bush Administration who outed Valerie Plame, but Snowden has committed the same crime (though admittedly for more admirable reasons). 

In our system of government, the proper way to seek changes to (or the abolition of) a system like this is though the political process.  The obvious rebuttal to this argument is that the public cannot seek changes to a system that it is unaware of.  This argument is not persuasive to me.  We may not have known the specifics of the NSA’s activities, but the fact that the US government has been engaging in extensive surveillance since at least 9-11 was widely known.  If it was a priority, voters could have elected members of Congress who would investigate such programs and seek to modify/eliminate them.  They have not done so.  The American people have validated this security apparatus in election after election.  That is their right – and Edward Snowden had no right to contravene that decision.

Edward Snowden may have been a hero if he had taken the harder route.  If he had exhausted his ability to protest within the system, then resigned and toiled in the trenches of politics pursuing a more open and accountable government with no guarantee of success or glory – that would be heroic.  But instead he decided to break the law and flee the country.  That isn’t heroic, its criminal.

Looking at income statistics it becomes obvious that there is no way someone who owns more than maybe $10 million has truly earned their wealth. The lifetime income of the average person is around $2 million, so I think that $10 million is a reasonable figure for a legitimate maximum lifetime income. Anyone who owns more than that has either inherited their wealth, or acquired it with a combination of luck and ruthlessness, usually through entrepreneurship or investment, that is to say either by getting others to work for them and keeping some or most of the money, or by lending out money and getting paid interest.

While entrepreneurs are important for the advancement of a society I don't think having an idea is worth a hundred or even a thousand times as much as doing actual work. And as for lending out money, people who do that are using a system that favors those who have something and allows them to accumulate more without actually working for it.

I believe that wealth should be highly regulated when it goes past a point that allows a family to have a very comfortable upper middle class life style, which would be the $10 million lifetime income I mentioned above.

Therefore, proceeds from sales of startups should be distributed amongst the employees who worked to build that startup, and not just go to the ""owner""; and interest on capital should be capped at a very low rate, maybe the rate of inflation plus 0.25%. One can probably come up with additional measures to help distirbute wealth more evenly, but I think those who alone would do a host of good already.

Yes, I realize I'm more or less parroting Marx here ([Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx), not Groucho Marx, mind you), but I think considering some of his ideas, and moving society towards a better and fairer distribution of wealth will make everyone's lives better.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,1375638508.0,,,True,t3_1joth8,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1joth8/i_dont_believe_rich_people_have_truly_earned/,

In fact, I believe determinism is necessary for free will. CMV.",Gehalgod,60,26,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1ihkjy/i_am_a_compatibilist_in_the_free_will_debate_this/,"I am a compatibilist in the free will debate. This means that I believe in the truth of universal determinism, but I still believe in free will. These are compatible phenomena.

Many of my reasons for being a compatibilist are outlined by Daniel Dennett in his book, *Freedom Evolves*. If you haven't read the book, the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_Room_\(book\)#Synopsis) has a decent summary of many of the ideas covered by Dennett. I considered myself a [hard determinist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_determinism) until I read *Freedom Evolves*.

The problem I originally had with compatibilism is that it allows our status of having ""free will"" to change depending on situations external to us, which seems to say nothing whatsoever about our wills.

It just didn't seem *good* enough to say that we have free will, yet concede in the words of Arthur Schopenhauer, [""A man can do what he wills but not will what he wills""](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Arthur_Schopenhauer#Quotes). In what sense would the ""will"" really be free?

I have since come to change my position on free will. I believe that human beings have it even if determinism is universally true. I believe that determinism is necessary for free will, in fact, ~~and I also believe that free will is something that we can say we really have even if we're not interested in moral responsibility, i.e., I'm not just confirming free will as a means of making sense of moral responsibility.~~

Here are my reasons for being a compatibilist, and for believing that determinism is necessary for free will:

**(I) Control is the type of free will worth wanting.**

Dennett's example is quite good in my opinion. He writes about a pilot who not only has direct, ""first-order"" (if you will) control over his plane, but also a special sort of foresight and control that allows him to direct the plane into places where *he will best retain control of it*. This higher-order control means that we are capable of responding to our environment with courses of action that have been planned rationally. We have the kind of free will worth wanting even if we ""cannot do otherwise"" in a metaphysical sense.

**(II) Indeterminacy and free will make no sense together.**

There are a few points I could make here. The first is that if indeterminacy does not give us free will based on the fact that if ""choices"" are non-deterministic, then deliberation does not necessarily bring us any closer to a decision.

I could weight the factors of two of my options (consciously or otherwise, whatever you consider meaningful deliberation to be in terms of getting closer to a decision) and if my deliberation is really to be called ""deliberation"", then it should be made more likely that I will choose one option and less likely that I will choose the other. But having indeterminacy involved would mean that my deliberation may actually mean nothing with regard to my decision.

Feeling as though we have free will is a prerequisite to actually having it. I find this point sort of self-explanatory but rather important to mention here. The ""feeling"" that we have free will *is* the same as deliberation, and so deliberation must mean something with regard to the actual decision we make. Here is an example:

&gt; Let’s say you are shopping for a new pet. You have your selection narrowed down to two dogs: a poodle and a German shepherd. You cannot take both dogs home. Your friend, Jack, gives you one week to decide which one you want. If you decide before the end of the week, then Jack will adopt the dog you don’t want. If you can’t make up your mind in a week, then Jack will adopt both dogs.

&gt; You seemingly begin to deliberate about which dog you want. Which one suits your lifestyle better? Which one is friendlier? Which one is cleaner? Which one will be easier to train? A multitude of questions come to mind coupled with potential answers depending on your prior experience of dogs. Let’s say that in the first three days, 75% of the questions you ask yourself about these dogs reveal that the German shepherd would be the better choice for you. After three days, you think you want to adopt the German shepherd but you aren’t sure yet. More deliberation is required.

&gt; Any deliberation that can really be called “deliberation” brings us closer to a choice. To be closer to a choice means that it is less likely that we will choose an alternative. If we want to say that randomness can give us free will, then we must concede that in such a case, deliberation means nothing with respect to choosing (and if we have free will, then deliberation must mean something with respect to choosing because deliberating is the same as the feeling that we are choosing). Randomness giving us free will would mean that, even if 100% of the criteria you deliberate over suggest that the German shepherd is the better choice, you are still just as likely (whatever “likely” might mean in the face of pure randomness) to choose the poodle. It makes no sense to say that this sort of randomness grants us free will. And if we make a choice with no deliberation, we are choosing without method. This is randomness as well in the everyday sense that we are either letting indescribable events determine our thinking, or we are surrendering to causality. In neither case do we find the type of free will that libertarians want to find.

This is the main problem I have with libertarian free will. They have to find a way to explain how indeterminacy gives us free will, and they simply can't.

**(III) Libertarian philosophers confuse determinism with fatalism.**

One libertarian author I read (Helen Steward, *A Metaphysics for Freedom*) argued that if determinism is true, then there is no such thing as an ""action"". She claimed that if everything is determined, then no conscious creature would ever have a reason to interfere and ""settle a matter"" in order to steer it away from it's determined path. This is, needless to say, a blatant confusion of determinism with [fatalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism).

**(IV) We are only moved to act by reason and desires.**

Reason and desires are not things that are up to us. They are this way by definition, I believe. Deciding what we want is a useless idea. In order to decide what we want, we would have to consult ourselves to see what we want to decide we want first. The nature of real wanting is that is a realization about the self.

Reason and beliefs are the same way, in that if we actually believe anything, even if the belief arose from some action in our past, *that* action was done because of a prior belief, and we will eventually reach a point where we have to say that one's predispositions to act were based on something that was not up to the agent himself.

**(V) Hard determinists are making unreasonable demands.**

They want to know how it is that we can ""will our own wills"". But willing our own wills does not make sense and so there is no way to tell whether it is a desirable form of free will. If determinism is universal, then it is kind of moot to say that it impinges upon free will. It's kind of like claiming that behavior is not true behavior because it relies on environments and genetics... which is everything that *could* determine behavior anyway and effects us all equally anyway, which renders the whole point moot. Humans have more free will than cats because we can control our responses to circumstances more rationally, with more ""higher order control"". Willing our own wills is nonsensical and the idea is not relevant.

**TL;DR** ... I am a compatibilist. I believe that free will and determinism are not only compatible, but that determinism is necessary for free will because libertarian arguments for indeterminacy and free will are not cogent. Many of the reasons I have for being a compatibilist are expressed very well in [Elbow Room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_Room_\(book\)) by Daniel Dennett. I believe that hard determinists are demanding something impossible from compatibilists when they ask how it is that we can ""will our own wills""."" Willing one's own will doesn't not make sense, but we have a form of higher-order control available to us that allows us to respond to our environments with rational courses of action, and it is determinism (not fatalism) that allows us to be driven from concrete reasons and desires into action. We have, in Dennett's words, ""the only type of free will worth wanting.""

Not that advertising it is within the spirit of religion anyway. Let me explain first that I am a Muslim. I believe in a divine being who created the world. I believe that Muhammad, Jesus, Moses and many others were prophets who tried to bring a message of the divine throughout human history. I am also a medical student. I believe in evolution, the scientific method, and believe that science is an important tool for improving civilisation and tackling ignorance and superstition.

But what are my reasons for the belief in the title? Well let me construct my argument for you.

* Religion is meant to encourage people to dedicate themselves to a greater good. Islam especially is about following almost a code of conduct, a creed where you spread good and neutralise evil. I feel the majority of religious people fail in this in one of the two following ways. Some let their faith become a strange metaphysical ""let jesus into your heart"" type of thing that endorses delusion (the more you want to believe it's true the more you will). This both alienates non-religious people and polarises religious people against them, preventing the development of an inclusive society that treats all people equally, regardless of their views. If you don't believe this point, I would ask you to envision an American president who isn't Christian.

Others have perverted their religion to their own political views, and use it as justification for holy conflicts, not only committing acts forbidden by religion, but allowing commentators to taint the silent majority by the actions of an extreme minority.

* Religious people who are indoctrinated with their religion or who have grown up with it do not fully understand why they perform certain rituals, or indeed what they are. Lack of knowledge about their religion beyond a superficial explanation for things is one of the reasons religion can be used to so easily manipulate people (for example the Selafi campaign tactic in egypt was basically to tell voters that their opponents were infidels). True religion requires critical thinking, but this is all too often forgotten by followers who think religion is about passively following rules and not actively effecting change.

This point extends to religious people who are selective in what rituals they perform, and I have to include myself in this. I'm talking about the Jew who doesn't eat kosher, the Muslim who drinks, or the Christian who doesn't turn the other cheek. Their hypocrisy undermines everything they are supposed to believe in. My argument is if you actually believe in the moral merit of the message, how can you follow it by any less than 100%?

* Then comes the worst of all. The narrow mindedness. Have you ever been in an argument with someone who seems to be trying to convert you, or at least prove that he's right and you're wrong. (Being fair, I have met atheists like this too) Religion is not about scoring points, or converting people, it's about setting an example through your actions. If we can't be in a position to discuss the various moral, social and practical insights our beliefs afford us without becoming personally offended by opposing views then we are giving away the noblest part of our human intellectual capacity for a meagre price.

In my experience dealing with patients and their parents: intelligent, hardworking professional couples well into their 30's are usually having just one or two children (this doesn't even count the ones that are childless who I don't see in the clinic).

Meanwhile, poor, welfare recipients are having several children. I saw a 28 year old single mother who does not work yesterday who had 9 children from 4 different fathers. These children will undoubtedly have a disadvantage growing up, and likely end up as their parents. Meanwhile, they will soundly outnumber the children of rich parents who had a high quality of life growing up creating a stratified society. This is both a burden to the individuals and society as a whole.

My plan would be to provide a BIG cash payout to rich couples for having their own children (because their high quality genes are as important as their high quality lifestyle they will provide to the child). Couple this with giving a BIG cash payout to poor people for not having their own kids (similar reasoning: genetics + environment). Even more of a payout for getting sterilized. I think the money saved by introducing more children raised by rich couples and higher quality genetics/environment and fewer children raised by poor couples and lower quality genetics/environment will more than make up the money we pay the respective couples.

1372452417.0,38,self.changemyview,1h9sqe,Vim is a bad text editor. CMV.,Dooey,70,32,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1h9sqe/vim_is_a_bad_text_editor_cmv/,"I tried Vim for about 2 weeks, hated it, and switched back to Sublime Text. I can't see why anyone would ever want to use it. Here are some of my problems with Vim. 

1) Too much configuration. If the editor is only good once I have tweaked it immeasurably, then I think that it is objectively worse than one that is good out of the box.

2) Shortcuts are inconsistent with OS shortcuts. On Macs and Windows, there is a system wide shortcut for moving the cursor left or right by one word, but Vim makes its own shortcut for doing that. Similar for deleting words, selecting words or paragraphs, and etc. I know that there are historical reasons that Vim does it that way, but I don't think that is a good excuse.

3) It is rarely more efficient. A very common thing I do while editing is type a line, then start the next line, then notice a typo in the first line and go back to fix it. In vim, this is ""esc-&gt;(move cursor to typo)-&gt;i-&gt;(correct typo)-&gt;esc-&gt;(move cursor to where it was before)-&gt;i"" which is way less efficient than ""(move cursor to typo)-&gt;(correct typo)-&gt;(move cursor to where it was before)"". Yes I know that you can navigate with the arrow keys but most people seem to think that is a bad idea for some reason, or somehow makes you less efficient, even though it saves keystrokes. Another example is saving a document, which takes 3-5 keystrokes in vim depending on if you are currently in insert mode or not (esc-&gt;:-&gt;w-&gt;enter-&gt;i) vs 2 in other editors (ctrl+s) and those 2 can basically be hit in parallel so its even better. In fact the only time that I've noticed that vim is more efficient when editing text is when I want to delete everything until the next closing square bracket, or move the cursor to the next occurrence of a character.

4) Using the keyboard instead of the mouse is not necessarily faster. Obviously the keyboard is great for many things, but for moving the cursor to an arbitrary position on the screen, a mouse is better. People talk about the overhead of moving your hand to the mouse, but its really not that far, and its more automatic than pressing a key sequence that depends heavily on the where you want to put the cursor relative to where it is now.

5) The interface is undiscoverable. In other editors, if I want to do something that I suspect the editor is capable of, but I don't know how to make it do that thing, I can look through the menus until I find it. Then, once I do find it, the shortcut is listed right there, so I don't have to do it with the menus next time. Also, many people don't know this but menus can be navigated without touching the mouse using a combination of the alt keys, windows key, and etc. Compare to vim, where if you think vim can do something but don't know how, you have to read the manual, or search google, both of which take longer than looking through a few menus.

6) Other minor nitpicks that are mostly about personal preference. I don't like the undo model, I think its too complex and the added complexity doesn't justify the added power. And I don't like how almost everything you do changes the clipboard/buffer, and when I paste, the text that appears is almost never what I expect. (I often copy something with the intent of pasting it in 20-30 seconds, then do a bunch of other edits before pasting)

I really want to like vim, anything that can make me more efficient is great, I just don't think vim is an efficient editor. Please, change my view. A couple requests though: please don't tell me ""you need to use it for x amount of time before it becomes good."" With the potential exception of #5, all of my complaints listed above apply to vim experts. Also, please don't compare vim to notepad. Compare vim to other full featured text editors.

2)	There is a disturbing application of Social Darwinism.  Only the fittest civilizations which can avoid their own destruction and can achieve technical wonders on their own are worthy of survival, or joining the federation

3)	It can easily be used as an excuse for inaction when there are tough decisions to make.

I am not part of any religion and I believe that the right of polygamy should be applied equally regardless of gender or sexual orientation. 

I am not saying that everyone should be in a polygamous relationship, I am saying that people should have the right to chose between polygamy and monogamy according to their values.

Here are my arguments:

* I do believe that it is possible of loving multiple people romantically at the same time. Many people do love their children equally, I don't see why this can't be true with romantic love.

* For anyone who would claim that we are naturally monogamous, according to science and anthropology we are not: [Scientists discuss the evolution of monogamy in humans as if it is the prevailing mating strategy among Homo sapiens, although only approximately 17.8% of 563 societies sampled in Murdock’s Atlas of World Cultures has any form of monogamy. These societies with monogamy account for much larger than 17.8% of the World population. Therefore, “genetic monogamy appears to be extremely rare in humans,” and “social monogamy is not common, ... often reduc[ing] to serial polygyny in a biological sense”. This means that monogamy is not the predominant mating system among the hominid lineage and probably never was](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy).

* I believe that the main determinant for any successful relationship is excellent communication, honesty, and trust. When those are present, people should also be able to work on their insecurities. I think that insecurity is the main factor leading to jalousy. If insecurity is not present and communication about values and boundaries is established, I don't see why one person could not simply be glad that their partner is happy. Therefore, I also believe that any relationship could be functional if everyone honestly and extensively discussed values and boundaries beforehand.

Whether or not we should have reasons behind our beliefs is entirely different, I just don't think there are such things as 'religious reasons'.

Granted, those are going to be murky waters, but reason nonetheless.

I believe that in school, bullying the 'weird kids' more adequately prepares them for a future interacting with society. It's nothing but a trite platitude that we like to say that 'everyone is unique', but in reality that is hardly true. What we determine as 'normal' in society isn't some template forged from the stars that we adhere to. Normalcy in society has been tempered through the interaction of countless thousands of people. Telling the people that any strange behaviors they exhibit (which typically make them magnets for bullies) are ""normal"" is doing severe damage to their ability to fit in with other people later in life.

Removing bullies from the equation means such errant behavior goes uncorrected. There was a kid in my middle school who was a bully magnet. He would walk up to people and make fart noises at them constantly because he thought it was funny (or something, I don't know). If we say that bullying of all types should go, in just a few short years this kid joins mainstream society and then what - he goes around making fart noises at other people? His boss?

I was bullied as a kid, and it taught me how to compartmentalize  behaviors I have, as well as how to play ""the game"". I could say some cliche shit about everyone wearing masks, but I don't think I need to, because I think you all know what I'm getting at. Without bullies, I think far more people would be unable to understand and comprehend how to play that game, and playing that game *well* is the secret to success in life. I can shift gears in my personality and change how I act in front of my friends to how I act in front of my boss's boss instantly, and frankly, I think that exact lesson was learned in my wee school days.

Removal of bullying just teaches the lesson that everything is okay and everyone will be accepting of you no matter what you're like, which isn't true in the real world whatsoever.

Ever since I was little, I remember being constantly told just how wonderful it is that we live in a diverse nation with a spectrum of people. For a long time, I ate it up.

As I move into adult life, though, I'm starting to become very jaded on the whole thing. It seems like America, Canada, Australia, Europe and Scandinavia must open their borders and become halfway houses for every down-on-his-luck asshole who wants a slice of the welfare pie. Why is it these nations only that must become less white? Give up their culture, or at least ""make room"" for the kinds of people we are traditionally aligned against (see: the difficulties second and third generation Islamic immigrants have integrating into European society)? Why doesn't Japan have to become more diverse? Russia? South America or Africa?

And then at the institutional level, what's with all the carte blanche these people are handed out? Maybe it's my university specifically, but it feels like whites, even non-American ""diverse"" whites, are under the microscope to make sure none of us flip out and start saluting the swastika. Meanwhile, the paper is running articles about racial crime ""quotas"", saying the campus police are morally obligated to arrest more white men to match the spike in black male crime (this year we've had high-profile incidents of black students expelled for fighting, firearms on campus, rioting, rape, theft, etc, it has been particularly bad). A few weeks ago they even ran an opinion piece saying that the university has a ""duty"" to expel/fire white students/faculty, and to no longer accept/hire whites, to make room for a more diverse student body! I work on campus, and the other week someone found ""WHITES WILL HANG"" written in a bathroom stall. No one said a thing about it. Meanwhile, the chancellor cried on camera a few months ago when ""the N word"" was similarly found. Thursday I overheard a black student telling another, ""It's not rape if she's white. It's payback."" How are we supposed to accept this Chicago thug culture? How is this good or positive in any way? Why are we inviting this behavior into our community? What benefit does this bring? I can't imagine ever inflicting rape upon someone, but *I'm* the one required to take ""tolerance"" and ""integrative"" courses?

I recognize these are individuals and that you can't judge a group by their behavior. I work and learn with people from around the world and different backgrounds, but here's the thing: They want to integrate, to assimilate, to become a part of the America tapestry. Meanwhile, so many more simply want a free ride on my back. People make a big deal about, ""Oh, it's 20XX, the white man's burden is gone, get with the times! We don't live in the 40s anymore!"" But I feel like the burden has shifted, now I work and work to pay for other peoples' EBTs so they can buy shitty food and lotto tickets. I myself qualify for welfare (Native American heritage), but I would never consider it anything as a last resort, just as my mother did when she was a teenage mother with an infant son and no partner. When a group or culture presents serious, recurring problems, what are we supposed to do?

The thing that annoys me most, too, is how you can't question any of it without some sociology/philosophy double major coining a new anti- -ist -ism -phobia about it. The facts are all around us, but we're too swept up by the feel good, ""I'm not racist at all!"" ideology to realize we're blowing it all on a dream, a fairy tale. And people say, ""Well, the benefit of diversity isn't for YOU! It's for them!"" So what? What the fuck does that mean? I have to labor so that people who legitimately hate me and my people can ""succeed""? We're stuck in a fucking twilight zone where western cultures bitch about how evil the West is, while everyone else either tries to modernize and meet western standards or moves to the West anyway. And when you ask people, straight up, ""What's so good about diversity?"" the response is always something as inane as, ""OMG don't you like Chinese food and ethnic music?!"" or it's some buzzword bullshit about how people different from me have different ideas, blah blah blah, but we've gotten along pretty damn well for the past couple thousand years.

I guess I just really want to know why things have to be this way. There's a very clearly defined border between genocide and open borders, why can't we remain comfortable with who we are? Why is the most successful, prosperous, inventive and advanced civilization known suddenly the great villain? Why does everyone unflinchingly accept just how great it is when studies show it's not? Why are people so quick to pat themselves on the back over it?

While my ideal society would not bear the same intolerant features of Saudi Arabian society, I believe that the Saudi Arabian legal system's dedication to the Quran shows true legal integrity. Whereas in the United States, we are constantly having our constitutional rights trampled by representatives of the majority, the legal system of Saudi Arabia is static and respects the rights and founding principles elaborated in the Quran.

You might argue that Saudi royals and other elites are given unfair treatment by the courts, but to me this is a petty concern when compared to the violation of constitutional rights in the USA that affects hundreds of millions of people. What's more, high-ranking politicians and other elites receive similar unfair treatment in the democratic West as well.

You might also argue that certain legal and fact-finding procedures are shaky, but such is the case for all legal systems of the world. Science and epistemology are not to the point of sophistication that we can presently convict every criminal with 100% certainty. The fact that we don't presently have a perfect technology of justice does not show a flaw in the Saudi Arabian legal system that cannot also be seen in any other legal system.

To summarize, I believe Saudi Arabia's legal system is just only because of its dedication to its founding documents, i.e. the Quran, sunnahs, etc. Western democracy has allowed representatives of majorities to trample the constitutional rights of minorities, and in many cases majorities as well, and I believe that this is unjust.

I am unequivocally NOT trying to stop others from voting, and I would feel bad if I did.  I can and have campaigned for politicians to get elected, I feel I can maybe make a difference that way, but actually casting a vote?  No.

This is for the following reason:  The value of my one vote is zero.  Either: the election will not be close, and my vote is like the difference between a 5.02544621% margin and a 5.02544622% margin: not even worth talking about.   OR, the election does come down to a one vote margin (I am probably more likely to die walking to the voting booth), and even in this case - the decision will be taken out of my hands, as with the '00 election in Florida which was nowhere near as close as one vote.

Secondly, voting comes at some (even if small) personal cost, i.e. my time.  Therefore, from an economical (or even game theoretical) point of view, voting is an irrational decision.  The only reason to do it is to be *seen* doing it. 

Arguments I've heard for voting that I find pretty weak:

* Slippery slope arguments: 'maybe you are just one rain drop, but a billion raindrops can become a storm...'.

* Similar: If people like you don't vote, then clearly people like you will not be represented in the election.

* If you don't vote in an election then you have no right to complain when the government doesn't act the way you want.

* It's your civic duty - 'your grandfather fought in the war so that you could vote...'

These are all irrational arguments if you accept my assumption that my vote has zero weight.  Unless I'm actively trying to stop others from voting, then my one vote didn't make a difference.  Yes, a million votes are a storm, but my vote had no influence on that, and it can't affect how others like me vote positively or negatively.  If I am just voting out of 'civic duty', then my vote is just a gesture.  I am happy to lie about whether or not I voted if it will make you feel better, but I like to think I act rationally, and for me, expending effort so that I can say I was part of an election is not a rational decision.

But organizations and groups (while I still feel that they have many, many negative sides) are the only ways to deal with certain things.  I.E., political parties will always exist in this form of government. Basically, individuals work better for some things, groups work better for others.

I don't know how much sense this will make. ..

I think individuals are smart. They have their own drives, goals, and motivations. 

But once people form into groups, big or small, more shit than good happens. The individual's opinions and thoughts are exchanged for broad and vague mission or group statements that can be easily manipulated by a corrupt leader. Basically, I believe the more variety in beliefs and ideas, the better. But unique ideas come from individuals, while groups tend to not branch out into new ideas, but remain the same mass of vague beliefs and ideas. Groups fight for things to stay the same while individuals bring change. 

Examples:

- the group of kids that succumb to peer pressure to be involved in dangerous or illegal stuff, like under age drinking or bullying. 

- religious organizations often espouse beliefs that its constituents don't always agree with, so it doesn't accurately reflect that body of people. In some cases, the belief of the religion causes many societal problems. The best example I can think of is the Mormon church. Pro lgbt groups are growing within the church, yet the leadership of the church has been extremely anti gay, both socially and politically in the last ten years. Many kids who grow up in a religion never really develop their unique personality because their entire lives are defined by the religion.

- in the us, we only have two ""main"" political groups. But I doubt anyone says their political party truly represents their individual beliefs. Instead, they sacrifice some of their individual beliefs just so they can be a member of a main party. 

- these main parties are so convoluted with power that they actually try to stop smaller parties from gaining any political ground. These parties are in power and want to stay that way. 

- even in groups of friends, people feel pressured to fit in and say anything just to be part of the crowd, ultimately losing their individual voice and unique ideas. 

- protests. Like in the zimmernan protests happening. The situation gets dumbed down to ""its just a racist man gettin away with a crime"" and it really isn't that simple. I have friends who are joining the protests without knowing much about the case, only going off of hearing its racist. There is no real cause, no solution.

[This study looked at Nigerian people's reasons to have many children, and concluded that most of it is due to cultural and religious factors.](http://www.bioline.org.br/request?ep08012)

I quote:

&gt;“The main reason why people want to have many children is because of the prophet's saying that: 'marry and produce a good generation for I shall be proud of your great number on the Day of Judgment'” (Female, North, Rural).

&gt;“The Yoruba regard children as legacy. They have as many as possible, so that whenever they pass away, they will have surviving children to take care of their possessions” (Male, South West, Urban).

&gt;“ No one should say that 'I will have only three or four' because God that created us knows the best for us and we should accept what He gives to us whether seven, eight, nine or twelve” (Male, South East, Urban).

[Between 2003 and 2008, most of Nigeria has seen an increase in its fertility rate.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Nigeria) Also important to note is that contraceptive use is only prevalent among the richer sections of Nigerian society, thus meaning that most population growth will be from the lower classes, leading to a perpetual decline in the genetic quality of population.

[In Nigeria, the desired family size for Muslims is 6.0](http://maxwellsci.com/print/ajms/v2-218-226.pdf) In other words, a large part of the problem here is not so much lack of contraceptive access, but rather, the desire of people to have a large number of children. 

[Bongaarts wrote:](http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3720911.html)

&gt;However, the high desired family size that prevails in much of Sub-Saharan Africa hampers fertility decline. Even if the existing unmet need for contraceptives could be addressed, fertility would remain well above replacement levels. This raises the question: Can fertility preferences be influenced, and if so, how?7 Reducing preferences has been a low priority throughout Asia and Latin America, where desired family size has declined to near replacement levels. But Sub-Saharan Africa is different. Although social and economic development may help reduce its high desired family size, the process could take decades; thus, massive population growth is inevitable. 

In some African countries, women actually have a *higher* desired fertility rate than their actual fertility rate. [In Niger, the desired fertility rate is 9.1](http://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-unmet-need.aspx?p=1) The actual fertility rate however is 7.0. Why then do these women not have more children? The answer may be biological limits to the human body, or economic necessity. If people can not afford to feed their children, this may finally force a limit on their fertility.

A natural decline to this high population growth is unlikely:

&gt;At the time of the last survey, the average desired family size for Sub-Saharan Africa (5.1 children per woman) was higher than the averages for North Africa and the Middle East (3.2), Asia (2.7) and Latin America (2.7). Decreases in these averages were modest. In particular, the decline in the Sub-Saharan African countries averaged just 0.13 children per woman. At this slow pace, it will take more than a century to reach a desired family size of two children.

**The question then becomes: Why do African cultures desire such large families compared to non-African cultures?**

The deeper answer may lie in biology. [Organisms vary on a spectrum of /r/K selection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R/K_selection_theory) A species that is more ""r"" has many children, at a lower cost per child, and fewer of these children survive into adulthood. A species that is more leaning towards K invests more resources in each child, and as a result has fewer children, but more of these children will survive into adulthood.

Humans overall are a very K selected species, but the degree of K selection appears to differ between groups. Scientists have known for a long time that infants of different races behave very differently when just born. [Compared to African babies, Caucasian babies are more helpless, while babies children are even more helpless compared to Caucasian babies.](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xz2jjx_cross-cultural-differences-in-newborn-behavior_news#.UdaxKG3zNRY)

African children in the United States are systematically found to enter puberty at a much earlier age than white children. [Normal gestation length in black women is also a week shorter than in white women.](http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/1/107.full)

Black women are far more likely to have twins than white women, who are far more likely to have twins than Asian women. The highest rates of twins is found in Nigeria, the lowest rate is found in Japan. [The reduced rate of twins in whites is caused by this genetic mutation.](http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/12/2659.full)

It seems therefore that the desire in East Asians and whites is to limit their fertility, because this allows them to invest more resources in their children. Africans have less of a desire to invest a lot of resources in their children, and as a result, less of a desire to limit their fertility.

In conclusion, biological differences make sub-Saharan Africans desire much higher fertility rates than whites and Asians, which will eventually lead to humanity becoming completely African unless we implement one child policies in sub-Saharan Africa.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,False,,,True,t3_1hoqgi,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hoqgi/i_believe_most_of_subsaharan_africa_needs_an/,

The cravings for these people don't seem to stop and they seem unable to make a strong personal choice to quit. Instead they rely on these people constantly re-enforcing them which simultaneously makes them feel helpless without the program. This on one hand can be a great environment and a very welcoming community that some people need. However, it's not something that I believe is a healthy way to quit and stay sober.

I enjoy discussing philosophy, but I increasingly feel that the philosophical questions lose their magic when you break them down critically.

My philosophical viewpoint rests on two premises that to me seem uncontroversial *(Edit: their controversy status is not central here; think of them as one metatheory that can lead to answers)*:

- The human mind is an instinctive, emotional, stereotypic and subconscious machine, subject to [hundreds of cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) and prone to [hundreds of logical fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies).

- Materialism is the default position until evidence of the contrary is shown.

---

***Categories of fallacious trivialities***

I contend that *philosophical questions in general* *(edit)* can be put into one or more of these five categories:

**1.1.** The concept is a humanly conceptualized [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory) without clearly definable boundaries. The question is as meaningful as ""at what shade does the color red cease to be red?""

**1.2.** The concept is an artifact of human intuition. Any reasoning will concern human subjectivity rather than the universe around us.

**1.3.** The question is merely a semantic dispute or a syntax error.

**2.** The question can easily be answered within materialistic (or otherwise Ockhamian) axioms. This does not denote absolute truth, but should be the default position.

**3.** The question is ill-suited for philosophy. No amount of purely philosophical reasoning can *(be verified to)* bring one closer to the truth. *(Edit: I've conceded that it might be an arbitrary category.)*

---

***Evaluations of some ""[unsolved problems in philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_philosophy)""***

**Aesthetics - Essentialism:** *Are there essential properties that make a thing what it is?*

See **1.1**. It depends on if the thing is already defined by those essential properties. The roundness of a geometrical shape will determine how central it is to the ""circle"" *prototype*, but it can only have a binary relation to the ""perfect circle"" *definition*. Almost all physical things are prototypes of vastly different gradualities.

*Does the quality of art correlate to its degree of organic form?*

See **1.2**. Even on a subjective basis, it's a very weak idea.

**Aesthetics - Art objects:** *What is art?*

See **1.1**.

**Epistemology - Gettier problem:** *Can knowledge be defined as justified true belief?*

See **1.1**. No, as Gettier shows.

*What is knowledge?*

See **1.1**.

**Epistemology - Molyneux problem:** *If a man born blind, and able to distinguish by touch between a cube and a globe, were made to see, could he now tell by sight which was the cube and which the globe, before he touched them?*

See **3**. The article itself mentions that this might not be an unsolved problem in philosophy, due to scientific studies.

**Epistemology - Infinite regression:** *As it is impossible to satisfy the justification element due to infinite regression, can one truly have knowledge of anything?*

See **2**. No. Pragmatically, it doesn't matter.

**Epistemology - Münchhausen Trilemma:** *It is impossible to prove any certain truth even in fields such as logic and mathematics. The proof of any theory rests either on circular reasoning, infinite regress, or unproven axioms.*

See **2**. See the previous question: it's a trivial notion that nothing can be known with 100% certainty. However, a proposition can theoretically be true *within an axiomatic framework itself* (but you can't be 100% certain that you wrote that axiom five seconds ago).

**Epistemology - Qualia:** *Is your blue the same as my blue?*

See **2** and **1.2**. If our brains are the same, then necessarily so.

*Is a human experience inherently different from that of philosophical zombie or a sufficiently advanced AI?*

See **2** and **1.2**. No.

**Ethics - Moral luck:** *A poor person is born into a poor family, and has no other way to feed himself so he steals his food. Another person, born into a very wealthy family, does very little but has ample food and does not need to steal to get it. Should the poor person be more morally blameworthy than the rich person?*

See **1.2**.

**Philosophy of language - Moore's disbelief:** *A first-person present-tense sentence such as, ""It's raining but I don't believe that it is raining"" is paradoxical.*

See **1.3**. The full form ""I believe that it is raining, but I don't believe that it is raining"" is a trivial syntax error.

**Philosophy of mathematics - Mathematical objects:** *What are numbers, sets, groups, points, etc.? Are they real objects or are they simply relationships that necessarily exist in all structures?*

See **2**. They are formal abstractions of the world around us -- not vice versa.

**Metaphysics - Sorites paradox:** *Is a bale of hay still a bale of hay if you remove one straw? If so, is it still a bale of hay if you remove another straw (ad infinitum)?*

See **1.1**.

**Metaphysics - Counterfactuals:** *What is meant when one asserts a conditional statement, the antecedent of which is contrary to fact? E.g. ""If Joseph Swan had not invented the modern incandescent light bulb, then someone else would have invented it anyway.""*

See **1.3**.

**Metaphysics - Material implication:** *In formal logic, the statement ""If today is Saturday, then 1+1=2"" is true; a causal or meaningful relation is not required. There is a discrepancy between material implication and the general conception of conditionals: is it an inadequacy in formal logic, an ambiguity of ordinary language, or no discrepancy?*

Valid question by itself, but see **3** and **1.2**.

**Philosophy of mind - Mind-body problem:** *Is the mind separate from the physical body?*

See **1.2** and **2**. No.

**Philosophy of mind - Cognition and AI:** *What are the criteria for intelligence?*

See **1.1**.

*Is it possible to artificially create consciousness?*

See **2**. Theoretically yes.

**Philosophy of mind - Hard problem of consciousness:** *Why is there a subjective component to experience?*

See **1.2** and **2**. *(Edit: personal hypothesis)* Short answer -- evolution. It seems clear that an organism with a conception of a coherent self-experience would have an evolutionary advantage. For how it actually arose, see **3**.

**Philosophy of science - Problem of induction:** *(1) Any inductive statement (like the sun will rise tomorrow) can only be deductively shown if one assumes that nature is uniform. (2) The only way to show that nature is uniform is by using induction. Thus induction cannot be justified deductively.*

See **2**. Indeed, it's as previously mentioned a trivial notion that nothing can be known with 100% certainty. Pragmatically, it doesn't matter.

**Philosophy of science - Demarcation problem:** *""The problem of finding a criterion which would enable us to distinguish between the empirical sciences on the one hand, and mathematics and logic as well as ""metaphysical"" systems on the other""*

See **1.2**. Mathematics and logic are not divine concepts, but rather useful human inventions based on axioms from what seems inductively obvious to us. Distinguishing between completely physical fields and completely abstract fields seems like the only possible answer. Human intuition might lead one to believe that there is a gradualness between physics and mathematics for example, but in reality, mathematics is a thoroughly abstract model of a study that is physical by definition. As for ""metaphysical systems"", see **2**.

**Philosophy of science - Realism:** *Is there a world independent of human beliefs and representations?*

See **1.2** and **2**. The subjective reality is a model of the objective reality, filtered by cognitive and sensory limitations.

- Point out a considerable flaw somewhere in my reasoning.

- Convince me in a logical manner that my view of philosophy is misguided.

Please refrain from fallacies such as these:

It's a relaxing process. You're carefully tending a flame and it forces you to be mindful of your breathing. I think the chemicals are also relaxing but I'm no chemist. Taking a break to smoke forces you to stop and pause. It gives you a small moment to think whilst doing something methodical yet simple. You can clear your mind whilst packing a pipe, rolling a cigarette or lighting a cigar with a match. It's almost meditation.

So why do I think it's worth the risk?

It's not that I don't think that there's a risk. The odds are high that something unhealthy will develop and it's probable that it'll be something really nasty. As for the risk to others, I would never smoke around children or anyone who didn't want me smoking. I'm not going to pretend smoking is healthy. I just think the benefits outweigh the risks. The benefits are the ones I've described above but also simply the feeling of throwing caution to the wind. It feels liberating. Another way of putting it would be this, the taking of the risk is in itself a benefit so great that it outweighs the risk itself.

Why do I think it's cool?

It's that risk taking that's cool. It's cool to drive at 300mph everywhere if you never crash and never get caught. It's cool to do a backflip off a building if you can land it. And it's cool to do something life threatening casually, especially when that thing is itself a symbol of a contained risk. It's a fire that you hold inches from your face without flinching or even considering it. 

Even before we knew it was dangerous it was cool. The image of smoke curling through the air like a whisper-thin sheet of silk caught on an intangible breeze in front of a calm, still, collected figure is a cool image. I've also heard that cigarettes and cigars were subconscious symbols of penises, masculinity and power. I don't know much about that sort of thing, but it meant that when a man smoked a cigarette, he was affirming his power and when women smoked cigarettes they challenged the idea of a male dominated society. So no matter who you were you were either cool because you were a powerful member of an influential group or a rebellious upstart looking for a revolution. Both are pretty cool.

So, can you change my view? Unless someone specifies, we'll assume we're talking about tobacco.

1368028239.0,34,self.changemyview,1dxr9d,I don't believe nonviolent protest are morally superior to political violence and do not consider MLK and Gandhi to be good examples of nonviolent protest movements. CMV,Mac8v2,45,11,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1dxr9d/i_dont_believe_nonviolent_protest_are_morally/,"I do not consider nonviolent protest and civil disobedience to be morally superior to using violence to achieve political goals. I believe holding up nonviolence as the best and only morally just way to achieve political change is just a way to protect established order. I also do not believe MLK, and Gandhi's actions are good examples of effective nonviolent protest since both movements were backed with the threat of violence.

""In his book How Nonviolence Protects the State, Peter Gelderloos criticises nonviolence as being ineffective, racist, statist, patriarchal, tactically and strategically inferior to militant activism, and deluded. Gelderloos claims that traditional histories whitewash the impact of nonviolence, ignoring the involvement of militants in such movements as the Indian independence movement and the Civil Rights movement and falsely showing Gandhi and King as being their respective movement's most successful activist. He further argues that nonviolence is generally advocated by privileged white people who expect ""oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement's demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.'""

I have to agree with Peter's view.  

As for MLK and Gandhi, both of their movement's success was largely the result of Cold War tension. The U.S. genuinely feared racial warfare and African Americans becoming communist at the time when the Cold War was at its peak. Extending rights to blacks was seen as a way to avoid violent confrontation at a time when the U.S. was internationally threatened by communist governments. As for Gandhi, his protest were the last stop before another full on sepoy rebellion. Considering the U.K.'s economic, and military position after the second world war, India's size and population pools, and Soviet and Chinese ability to supply foreign revolutionaries (such as their involvement in Indochina), the U.K. would not have been able to prevent a violent Indian revolution. So while both of those movement were nonviolent, they were backed up with a serious threat of violence. Giving in before they became violent was the method chosen by politically smart Americans and British rather than the result of compassionate mind changing. 

This isn't an unpopular academic assessment. 

""In 1958, an African-American handyman named Jimmy Wilson was sentenced to die in Alabama for stealing two dollars. Shocking as this sentence was, it was overturned only after intense international attention and the interference of an embarrassed John Foster Dulles. Soon after the United States' segregated military defeated a racist regime in World War II, American racism was a major concern of U.S. allies, a chief Soviet propaganda theme, and an obstacle to American Cold War goals throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Each lynching harmed foreign relations, and ""the Negro problem"" became a central issue in every administration from Truman to Johnson.

In what may be the best analysis of how international relations affected any domestic issue, Mary Dudziak interprets postwar civil rights as a Cold War feature. She argues that the Cold War helped facilitate key social reforms, including desegregation. Civil rights activists gained tremendous advantage as the government sought to polish its international image. But improving the nation's reputation did not always require real change. This focus on image rather than substance--combined with constraints on McCarthy-era political activism and the triumph of law-and-order rhetoric--limited the nature and extent of progress.""  

I am not calling for violence outright, but I am suggesting that activist should not shy away from considering violent means to achieve their goals. I also believe nonviolence should not be put forward as the ultimate moral superior to all other protest.

Sure, I understood why those languages existed from a historical sense, but I never understood why there were so darn many.

For a while this led to me thinking ""erry'body should learn English!"" thanks to a bias of me already speaking it. But, over time and personal growth, this has evolved to me simply thinking everyone should learn on single language, regardless of whether or not it is English.

I see a few benefits to this:

1. It better facilitates communication. In an age when the Earth has been made tiny by computers, air travel, and the like, it seems silly to have so many languages to deal with, both in people's personal lives, to business communications, to political discourse. Why not cut out the translation middle-man and get everyone on the same level?

2. It better facilitates media. Right now, media from all over the world (including literature, articles, videos, broadcasts, movies, video games, comics, and television shows, among other things) are limited in reach by language. Not everything can and will be subtitled or dubbed in every language, and even those that are often lose much of the luster and clarity of the original. For an example, just take a look at the anime market.

3. It creates common ground. It's well known that language helps define how people think and, because languages often create (or are created by) different cultures, they all emphasize different sets of values. And I certainly understand needing to keep the ability to express different cultural value sets within language. So, why not create a large language that allows for the expression of different ideals while narrowing the amount of separation between people? Why not make the various words overlap and, instead, focus on how they are used to create personal and societal identities?

Those are my thoughts, but I am aware that many people love and defend multilingual societies, so I would like to hear what those people have to say. And who knows, I may very well find reason to change my views =3

NOTE: I'm not looking for information on whether getting the world to adopt a single language would be practical or not. I'm simply looking for arguments about why, if somehow presented with the opportunity, we should not go for it.

Meanwhile, you've got the talented people, who ""don't have to work as hard"", because they're supposed to be inherently good at whatever it is they're doing. They don't go as far as they potentially could.

And now, we also tell these people that ""You can be whomever you want!"" You can be a writer, or a scientist, or the POTUS... Anything is within your reach! Your current life is going to seem a lot less satisfying. We might forget how amazing our life is already, because there's a potential ""better version"". On top of that, it directly contradicts the idea of talent, saying that whatever position you end up in is your fault. We're told that some people have a tendency to be drawn to certain skills, while simultaneously claiming that it's our fault if we don't succeed at something, and we never realize how absurd the whole thing is, because the two ideas are never placed face-to-face.

Also, it creates a minority of people who feel like they're doing something they don't want to, simply because they're ""good at it"".

Of course, there are exceptions. This model might actually empower some people to do more, or they might convince themselves that they chose the place they're at, but for the majority of people, it just doesn't work.

I think this is a gross misrepresentation of what's actually happening and just an ""armchair psychologist"" way of diagnosing a generation of underemployed young adults when it would be more accurate to blame the shoddy economy as well as an imbalanced work force which has too many liberal arts graduates and high school dropouts and not enough STEM majors and trade workers. 

Being born in 1993, I was a member of this [""breathing award""](http://www.chicagonow.com/good-bad-parents/2012/01/how-many-breathing-awards-does-your-child-have/) generation and I do not think it has negatively affected me. For example I got ribbons every year in grades 1-5 for participating in the science fair even though I never won. I remember liking my ribbons and I even had all 5 of them in a collection at some point, but I wasn't idiotic enough to believe that my ribbon was anywhere near as good as the big trophy that the top three winners received. Nor do I think any of my classmates were. I knew the ribbon was just a signifier of my participation and that's it. The ribbons acted as trinkets of nostalgia for me and nothing more.

Once I won the school spelling bee and a month later the citywide spelling bee. In both cases, all the participants received ribbons for participating. I got a trophy and a free bike after I won the citywide bee. It was clear to me that by winning I got the much better, bigger reward. I felt proud of myself for winning and the ribbons the other kids received did nothing to lessen my sense of accomplishment. 

I think from a young age (maybe not 2 years old, but definitely by 5 years old) kids understand the significance of winning vs. participating. It's not a difficult concept. I don't think praising kids for participation is a bad thing. In fact, I think it's a good thing. Even though I didn't win the science fair, I was better off for participating in it than the kid who skipped the science fair to play video games every night for two weeks instead. Even though my baseball team was never best in the league, I was better off for playing on the team, getting some exercise, learning some social skills and teamwork skills, disciplining myself to go to all the practices, and for learning how to improve a complex skill. I wouldn't have gotten better at baseball had I been at home watching cartoons, and I also wouldn't have gotten a ribbon. Participation is so important that there's even a famous phrase that goes something like, ""Showing up is eighty percent of life"". Another popular one is ""go to every class in college, attempt all the assignments, and you'll get at least a C."" In the real world, you don't need to be the first place winner to be successful. You can still get a job and join the middle class if you graduated 50th in the class instead of valedictorian. The truly unsuccessful people are the ones in the bottom 10 or 20th percentile of society. And what's a good way to avoid being in the bottom of the 10-20% of society? *By participating*, because even if you're not the best one there, you're still better off for being there.

To be clear, I'm not suggesting that we only reward participation. No way. It's crucial to reward competency, talent, hard work, and outstanding results. But I don't see any problem with rewarding participation as well as rewarding competency, and in fact I think there could be benefits. 

However there may be some good reasoning for why people believe rewarding participation is an inherently bad thing, and it would be nice to see those arguments laid out in a thoughtful manner instead of the typical Reddit circlejerk format that you find in the default subs.

Here's an example of what I mean. [In this article, Sheryll Cashin states:](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/41810267/ns/us_news-life/)

“You have a choice of whether you are willing to be around your people or go 180 degrees in the other direction,” she says. “To the higher income black people, if you don’t want to love and help your lower-income black brethren, why would you expect white people to? If you can’t do it, no one in society can do it. You can try to flee or you can be part of the solution.”

Interesting, because [Sheryll Cashin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheryll_D._Cashin) is a law professor at Georgetown instead of being a professor at a predominantly black college, and (most likely) does not live in a poor neighborhood of Washington D.C. Looks like she fled, and is now asking *other people* to be 'part of the solution' instead of doing it herself. Where's the criticism on her for leaving her ""black brethren"" behind? (Note: [I did find this article that criticized Sheryll's statement](http://www.whataboutourdaughters.com/waod/2011/3/2/georgetown-professor-sheryll-cashin-tells-middle-class-black.html))

Why should a black family that's 'made it,' stick around in a poor neighborhood? You'll never hear an author ridicule white people for moving out of a trailer park as ""abandoning their white brethren."" It's not as if all white people are rich, there's still plenty of poor white people throughout the country. So why does one ideal exist for one group and not for another? Why should black people be made to feel guilty for becoming successful and moving out of poor areas?

That kind of went off on a tangent specific to Sheryll Cashin, and while I think what she said was bullshit, I'd still like to stick to the main point of referring to black people as the ""black community."" I think it's racist to treat black people as part of one monolithic group, instead of as individuals.

My views are shaped by my experiences in college (still in college, 22 y/o, and I haven't been affected by this issue in any serious way):

In particular, there's a lot of pressure to remove party pics from your social media profiles. Businesses think less of those who show that they drink.

There's also a lot of underage drinking going on in college, and a decent amount of students get fake ID's to get away with it. 

Public figures who are still in university (like a famous football player) get flack for making it known that they party.


My point being, why should anyone care? If you take every person who's ever been in college and drank underage, done something stupid at a party, or gotten a fake ID, and fire them from their jobs or prevent them from promotion or throw them in jail for faking an ID; a lot of great, talented, and useful people in society would be taken down in the process. Nearly half the population in college right now would drop, too.

To be clear: if we threw peoples' personal party/drinking lives into the public realm (in America), a great deal of them would receive a lot of flak for it. This, to me, is wrong because there are wonderful people who drink and party, so it's obvious that drinking and partying does not mean someone is a bad person.

My opinion excludes those who drink while driving (which is terrible), or do horribly violent things while drunk (things that reshape a person's life for the noticeably worse; bar fights aren't always horribly violent in this respect--though they can be), but **does not** exclude people who made poor life decisions and ended up pregnant, charged with an MIP/other underage drinking charge, people who provide to minors, or people who end up in a hospital. Once again, the situations I mentioned after the bolded text are extremes to drinking that I don't feel should be judged too harshly by society (too harshly meaning that someone would lose a job or a promotion over it even if they qualified for the job or the promotion otherwise). These are not the situations I wish to discuss at first.

If you get fired or quit you lose your share. Everyone with a vote participates on filling the position of General Manager. He is chosen for a short period of time and can be re-elected. Other than these strange ways it works as any other company with its hierarchy in and to increase profit. 

I do believe that if all companies in the world were such it would solve a lot of problems like distribution of wealth because it would not allow people to get disproportionately rich.

And overall effectiveness of companies would rise because the success of the company would directly affect every person working there. 

I know there are similar kinds of companies around the world but for some reason they are not particularly popular. 

Show me how this is not the most beneficial way for companies to operate for all men kind.

-----------------------------

**EDIT1:** So I'll clarify some points that people got confused about. Apparently I didnt make it clear at all:

Share in the companies

1. They have only 2 functions help distribute the money which in a normal company would go to shareholder profits and bonuses equally among everyone in the company AND it provides both a way to engage people with the welfare of the company and gives them a strong voice so that its almost impossible to abuse the workers.
2. Shares are not the only way people make money. They get regular salaries like in any normal company today.
3. They cannot be sold you cannot get more than the one you get when you begin to work there and you lose it when you leave regardless of why. No one that doesnt work in the company can buy or get any in any way.

**EDIT2:** Yeah guys several of you pointed what I belive is the biggest flaw with this idea. If implemented what would push the economy to grow. People would have much less intensive to start new businesses or at least to grow it. Will think on that for a while and if I cant find a way around that I'll consider my mind changed.

&gt;Racism is usually defined as views, practices and actions reflecting the belief that humanity is divided into distinct biological groups called races and that members of a certain race share certain attributes which make that group as a whole less desirable, more desirable, inferior, or superior.

Though my understanding of evolution may be fairly limited by both my age and knowledge, I have learned enough to know that evolution is essentially the process over a large amount of time where traits and characteristics of animals change over time due to diversity in genetics that result from the biological processes. We already say that evolution has led to many of the species today, with lots of their traits and characteristics having ""evolved,"" from more basic, previous versions of animals. In my classes we generally talked about examples like Darwin's Finches and butterflies in the United Kingdom, where a large percentage of said species share similar traits due to them being effective for survival. 

Why, then, is saying things like ""Asians are smarter,"" or ""African Americans are faster,"" considered so wrong by society? If we have already shown that other animals have changed and adapted over time, why is this not extended to today's population of humans? I have asked many people I know in real life how can the races not have differences between each other if evolution exists, but all I am met with is ""That's racist.""

CMV.,shaggy25,55,19,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1hsz18/the_zimmerman_case_has_me_rethinking_modern/,"I think a lot of modern ""liberalism"" is about guilt. Guilt about being white. Guilt about being American. Guilt about not being totally poor and useless. Emotions, and especially guilt, are a terrible way to build a political system and run a society.

The road of guilt has led modern liberals to an absurd extreme where they toss out what used to be common sense ideas about due process and considering all the facts in the name of a ""larger truth."" They're desperate to validate their insane view that whites are responsible for all black suffering, and they refuse to accept that black culture is messed up on any level and needs correcting. Furthermore, they concoct all kinds of narratives to support this larger truth.

The Zimmerman case is a classic example of the creation of a narrative to support the larger truth. It was painted as a white man shooting down an unarmed black boy in a gated neighborhood. This clearly fit the larger truth that racism and racial profiling is still a problem and whites are to blame. But then the truth came out - the man wasn't white - he was of mixed race with African, Amerindian, White, and Jewish heritage. The ""boy"" would be old enough to be tried as an adult for serious crimes. Moreover the gated neighborhood they lived in wasn't upper class and filled with blueblood white aristocrats as insinuated but rather a comically diverse middle class subdivision that had previous crime issues. Not to mention that the shooter was acting in self defense and had wounds and witnesses to corroborate his side of the story. The narrative failed yet liberals still are convinced that it was murder in order to play to the larger truth at hand rather than the actual truth that occurred.

**tl;dr:** the modern liberals' jumping of the gun and trying to put every event in the form of a narrative that fits an overall ""larger truth"" is sad, unjust, and has me re-thinking modern liberalism.

1. ""We shouldn't be teaching girls not to get raped, we should be teaching boys not to rape."" 


This strikes me as facetious, disingenuous, and somewhat ignorant of reality. It seems extremely obvious to me that we should be teaching both ideas, and we already are. 

To argue that we shouldn't be teaching women not to get raped is ludicrous! It is the responsibility of every able-bodied individual to defend themselves from any attack, sexual or otherwise. Identifying the circumstances in which women are most often sexually assaulted and teaching young women how to recognize those circumstances and be aware of or avoid them is completely reasonable, and in no way ""blames the victim."" Teaching girls not to put themselves in unsafe situations is not the same as telling girls who get raped that it's their fault. 


I can assure you, any boy in the care of responsible parents is being taught that rape isn't ok. To say ""we should be teaching boys not to rape"" completely ignores the fact that well-mannered, considerate people *aren't committing rapes.* Rape is an attack like any other, and anyone who attacks another person outside of self defense is acting on motivation that can not be educated against. 


Which leads me to my next point...

2. The definition of Rape. 


Maybe I'm just misunderstanding people, but this the point of conversation that most often has me baffled by the kinds of points people try to argue. If you are able-bodied and conscious, **you are responsible for your well being.** Having sex you regret is not rape. Having sex you don't want to continue having but not indicating that you want to stop because you're embarrassed or afraid of disappointing someone is not rape. Having sex while intoxicated is not rape. Being verbally ""convinced"" to have sex and still giving consent is not rape. If you give consent, anything that happens is consensual until you explicitly communicate that you don't want to continue.

It is wholly unpersuasive and works only to kill a discussion. Doing a job is not neutral; you represent your employer and function within a system to maintain that system. . I’m saying that not the person is wrong, but that the job in itself can be wrong, and that, therefore, “doing his job” cannot justify somebody’s actions. I find it appalling that this argument allows individuals to mindlessly follow a set of directions, policies, and commands. You sell your time and labor for a job, but you should never sell your morality or private thoughts. 

To clarify, what I’m thinking about here is not making a person’s job impossible, it is not to stop policing. Nobody likes it when a jerk is just being jerk. This argument seems to be used most frequently when police officers are criticized. What I’m talking about is indiscriminate violence while kettling or in a mounted police charge, the use of tear gas, tasers, or pepper spray. I’m talking about helpdesk employees whose job it is not to help people, but to make sure they hang up and don’t call back. Helpdesk employees are used solely to shield those responsible for the real operations from criticism and responsibility, and become part of a system which removes accountability by the set of instructions they are forced to follow. It has come to a point where, when an employee sees a legitimate problem, he can’t even reach those who have the power to change the policy (that was my personal experience as helpdesk employee). 

I’m not saying that all actions by employees are wrong. And I’m sorry I single out 2 professions, but they are most illustrative. Also, not every action of a police officer or helpdesk agent can (nor should) be analyzed this way. I’m simply saying that there’s a limit to what “doing your job” can justify ethically, even when one is doing his or her job to the letter of the law and according to every policy guideline drawn up.

I want to start out by saying that I'm not some kind of twisted pro-life troll. If you look at my post history, you will find that in general I do not shy away from having offensive opinions.

I have been convinced largely by the arguments proposed by the Australian bioethicist Peter Singer. Singer argues from a Utilitarian perspective that the total quality of life is increased when children with birth defects are euthanised after birth, because the parents can have a healthy child instead.

Although I have no birth defects myself, I have seen in my own life the suffering inflicted on people with birth defects. People with visible birth defects are isolated from their peers for their entire life, and suffer from pervasive feelings of inadequacy. The vast majority never enter relationships or have children.

Opponents of infant euthanasia generally argue that you should not decide on someone else's death, but I disagree. On average, there are 94.000 suicide attempts for every 1.500 successful suicides in my country. The majority of these people are unable to decide on the outcome of their own life, because although they want to die, humans carry inbuilt instincts that cause us to avoid self inflicted death.

Yesterday I witnessed a man attempt to kill himself by jumping in front of a train, and although his attempt failed, he had to suffer through the indignity of having dozens of people look at him, with some apparently even photographing him and informing their friends and family members. In our present day society, it is quite clear that those who are born with defects are largely chained to life, and most have no way out other than mercy of nature.

Some of you might argue that governments should simply legalize voluntary euthanasia instead, and allow people easy access to methods of euthanasia but this is not a complete solution either, because although many people born with birth defects would rather be dead, many are likely burdened with a sense of guilt towards their family members, which would prevent them from pursuing euthanasia.

Many children born with birth defects end up abandoned by their parents, left to be raised by professionals. All evidence indicates that children abandoned by their parents suffer severe emotional problems, which professionals try to combat through use of psychoactive drugs. I believe we should extend Planned Parenthood's motto ""every child a wanted child"", to children born with birth defects.

I do not know how relevant this is, but on a metaphysical level, I do not believe that death is the type of absolute most people consider it to be, and I believe our culture has an unhealthy fear of death, which people in more primitive cultures would interpret as being a form of cowardice.",,False,,t5_2w2s8,False,,,True,t3_1fnj3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fnj3q/i_believe_that_parents_should_be_allowed_a_30_day/,

CMV.,tigerhawkvok,54,21,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1f9bqn/i_think_that_many_of_the_major_progun_arguments/,"Yes, this is related to some of the arguments posted in the recent gun CMV. 

Point of clarification: I am almost always talking about semiautomatic and automatic weapons, and all handguns. Your 4ft long hunting rifle, bolt-action, still hunts/protects but isn't committing any crazy sprees and isn't sneaking up on someone. My view is currently most like ""Ban all firearms under 1m in length, and all those that are automatic or semiautomatic in nature"". However, that's not really the point of this CMV. So, the points - 

Here are a few that come to mind right now:

1) ""Why make them illegal when criminals will get them anyway""?
Why doesn't this exact same argument apply to:  
- Breaking and entering  
- Murder  
- Theft  
- Any patently antisocial activity  
I think that criminalizing all of those activities increase the barrier to entry, and decreases total participants, and decreasing participants in gun-wielding will reduce incidental, ""crime of passion"", and other non-violent-crime deaths. **EDIT: I happen to think that it probably will reduce violent crime, but we'd need to test it here, in the US, to see. I'm willing to ignore that and cede, in my mind, the ""worst case scenario"" that it does not reduce violent crime.**


2) ""Giving X a gun lets them defend themself in case Y""  
I fail to see how knowledge of the defender owning a gun -- even having one on them -- doesn't just make the attacker add the sentence ""move toward your gun and I shoot"" and become and equivalent case to non-gun-ownership. An attacker, virtually by definition, will already be in a threatening, wielding, posture in and in a position of power to dictate terms of the interaction. They should always be able to pre-empt a situation like this. Why isn't this true? If you assume that the attacker does not possess a firearm, what makes that a reasonable assumption, especially given that some of the most pro-gun advocates advocate enforced carry? **EDIT: I forgot to ask about the comparison to non-lethal options. Stun guns, tasers, etc for people; bear mace, etc., for aggressive wild animals**

3)  ""If people can't legally get guns and criminals illegally have it, there is still violent crime X!""  
Strawman! No one debates that. The point is that incidental deaths by legal firearms will be absent. It seems like every time the debate comes up, you hear ""getting rid of legal guns won't stop robbery at gunpoint!"" or something similar (rape/gang incidents/etc). Am I wrong in feeling that this strawman is frequently set up? Or is there a reason that I shouldn't consider this a strawman?

4) ""X kills more people annually than guns"".  
I have never seen an ""X"" that is not done VASTLY MORE than wielding a gun with safety off (eg, active use), when the accurate comparison would be deaths/(active use interval):deaths/(active use interval). I have *never* met anyone or even heard of any case where someone spends comparable time with a loaded, ready, gun ready compared to sitting in a car; yet, comparing gun deaths to automobile deaths always seems to come up. Why is this (very) common argument valid in the slightest? It really feels like comparing apples and chickens.  **EDIT: It was mentioned this is a worst-case. I would argue it isn't. Talking about the gun in a holster, or with the safety on, or in a drawer, is like talking about parked cars killing people, or people drowning in empty swimming pools, or death by alcohol in a sealed bottle before any has been taken (I hope everyone would agree that's absurd). *It isn't being used*. Hope that helps**

**EDIT:  
5) ""Guns are there to keep the government in check"".  
Really? Any amount of armament you have is going to keep an M1 Abrams at bay? An F22? A SWAT team? A CIA sniper? Please. If anyone really does believe that their personal firearm ownage -- and those of people they know -- are going to do a single thing against government military, paramilitary, or special ops forces, oh boy please justify that. I mean, our populace isn't filled with Jason Bournes, James Bonds, etc.; that idea seems to me to be wishful thinking to live in an action movie as the hero. I thought that that was obvious but there was a comment on it.**

I will try very hard to not respond to the comments in the thread proper to mitigate thread degeneration (SIWOTI syndrome), and update this as applicable. Please respond to one or all points here.

There seems to be a ubiquitous assumption that parents have some sort of inherent right to raise their children as they see fit. 
Is there any logic at all behind this?

I don't see how the fact that a person has given birth (or got someone pregnant) somehow means they should be able to dictate how another person (their child -- a human being) must live their life. (from a moral point of view) 

When I hear people say, ""don't tell me how to raise my kid,"" or, ""I know what's best for my child,"" it makes my blood boil. **You do not (necessarily) know what is best for your child.** (Further, if the people that I've heard saying this are any indication, I probably *do* know better.)

I am talking about parental rights across the board:

* Automatically being granted custody
* Teaching your kids your religion
* Choosing what video games (or tv shows or foods, etc) they are not allowed to (or are required to) partake in
* Making medical decisions
* etc

I don't see how the parent of a child has any more of a fundamental right to make these decisions for that child than anyone else does.

What I am **not** doing here:

* Trying to say anything about whether parents do or do not have any particular legal rights
* Proposing an alternative social structure that would reflect the fact that parents have no special rights
* Making any sort of argument about what is *practical*
* Asking why this assumption exists (whether or not it is right). This is obvious and does not warrant explanation.

I am talking only about whether or not parents *should have* any more of a right to the final say-so when it comes to their children than anyone else should.

(before you ask, ""Well, who should have the final say-so?"" My answer is that *I don't know*, but, this is about whether *parents* should have any special privilege in this regard.)

[Edit: I think that in an ideal world, the kid's future self could come back in time and make the decisions for their self. This obviously isn't possible. Why should the biological parent be second in line for the right?]

[Edit2: The only argument I've heard so far that holds any real water (as best I can tell) is that biological parents are *can be expected* to have a strong natural drive to protect their biological children, and as such are *more likely* to make choices in favor of the interests of the child. This, while possibly true, is entirely a practical issue, and speaks nothing of whether it is right in principle. 

If we're making ""best interests of the child"" arguments, then ask yourself whether or not Mr. Rogers should be able to take over custodianship of any child he chooses against the parents will. I'm pretty sure he can be expected to raise a kid better than the vast majority of parents. If you don't think he should be able to do that, why? There must be something deeper than that practical issue that causes you to side with the parents.
