1286474189.0,28,self.Survivalist,do5y2,"Time to fess up: I'm a survival enthusiast and believe in preparedness, even though I've never done it, and i'm not even remotely prepared. In fact, I have nothing. ",loogielv,33,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/do5y2/time_to_fess_up_im_a_survival_enthusiast_and/,"I suppose I should be honest.  I feel like a phony.  I love anything having to do with survival.  I watch everything, I envy those that go out with nothing and create sustainability.  I used to camp alot as a kid and I'd wonder why dad would bother bringing matches and lighter fluid.  Why not just rub sticks together?  Sure it would take longer, but it's better.

At any rate, I'm now 30, I have 3 kids and I've taken them camping once.  I feel like a loser for not doing it more, and letting them connect with nature (and lets be honest, me) in a way that was so important to me growing up.

We watch Man Vs Wild together and Survivorman and a number of other ones.  We talk about it, and the importance of being prepared, but truthfully, I have nothing.

Now I will admit, If I had the money, I would be more diligent in both getting preparedness items and taking them fishing/camping more.  Our major roadblock is money.  

I do have a ruck sack, a giant spool of paracord and a rather nice fishing pole and tackle box.  Other than that, nada. 

I'm ashamed, but I've decided to change that. We've been watching videos on youtube of bug out bags, mini survival kits, mini fishing kits etc, and I know I can build them each a set for under $20.   Sure we may never need them and still won't have the money to camp more than once a year, but the real treat will be sitting down with them and building them.  

So I just wanted to come clean.  I thought it might be cool to document (here on reddit, maybe some youtube vids) my trip from unprepared idiot, to slightly more prepared idiot, but maybe not.  

Either way, I know I have to do this. When I showed my middle son (he's 7) a youtube vid of a kid, couldn't be more than 8 years old, who built his own survival kit, my boy perked up.  He was excited, said he wanted to do it too.  So I gave him an Altoid's tin I had and he walked around looking for things to put it in.

""We can put these crayons on there. Never know when you need crayons in the wild dad, right?  We can put these lemon juice packets in there. Water might not taste great out there, right dad? We can put these nails and screws too right dad?""

Now, his little kit has some crayons, some string, some screws, a tiny magnifying glass, a tiny leatherman knock off, a pencil sharpener ""for shaving sticks to make fires"" he said, which is brilliant, and some small rubber gaskets he found, that won't do anything, but he thought looked cool in there. Awesome, right?

I live right outside of DC (can literally see the Washington Monument from my front door) and feel I want to protect my family if anything happens. 

The problem I am having is that there is a lot of information to sift through. So I have a question about water. Imagine that tomorrow everything shut down and was I unable to obtain clean water. 

What would I need to clean water if we bunkered down and stayed in and what would I need if we had to bug out? I am starting to create a Bug Out Bag and am slowly acquiring things. 

I have looked at the Katadyn Water Purification Filter, is that good for home use and out? What is the best water purification tablets? Iodine, bleach, charcoal, this stuff can get confusing. Thanks again!

Part 1: The Beginning of the End,loogielv,19,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/dsyg6/starting_to_survive_a_newbies_outlook_part_1_the/,"As some of you may now, I recently [fessed up](http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/do5y2/time_to_fess_up_im_a_survival_enthusiast_and/) about being a Survival enthusiast, yet had never done one thing to prepare.  

Well I've recently taken some steps, and I'd like to share the journey. 

This will be a multi-part series, where I'll update as I feel bored at work. 

This first part, titled ""The Beginning of the End"" focuses on things that I recently learned, that several people may be overlooking as they venture forward into the apocalypse, or preparedness.  To put it another way, stuff that we should be doing NOW, to begin to prepare, though not quite preparing...more like ""practicing""

What I did to learn these things, is very simple. I decided my tree out front was too big.  It had branches pushing up against the house, and overlapping my driveway, and instead of firing up the chainsaw, I climbed that fucker and took a $5 hatchet to the limbs. 

I then used the wood and branches for me and my sons to build what I told them was a fort, but actually was a practice survival shelter.  An A-Frame type. Anyway, they had a blast, and we spent some good time together, and all the while, I was practicing and learning.

Below are some newbish things that I learned:

* **Swing your hatchet** This means, get out and use your hatchet and axe **NOW**.  When the time comes, and you actually have to rely on your hatchet to save yours and your family's life, you need to have your muscles and hands in check.  See, the first time you use your hatchet, you will earn yourself blisters, and sore muscles.  Your muscles will cramp up mid-swing if these activities are foreign to your body. Hot spots will develop on your hands that will put you in agony.  This pain and agony will not kindly subside and wait merely because you HAVE TO finish for the sake of your family.  You WILL have to work through it, and that could equal a lack of concentration or effort on your part, which could be deadly for you or your family. 

Instead, get out now and swing that hatchet; get those blisters; get those sore muscles; and get that body used to this type of behavior; and get it out of the way NOW, so that way when its real, you won't have real pain.  Do it every weekend if you can, or at least bi-weekly.

* **FUCK that hatchet.  Bring a saw!** Obviously this counter points the above, but let me explain.  Chopping with an axe or hatchet will consume calories like crazy, and weaken and tire you out at an astronomical pace.  There are a plethora of youtube videos and internet articles that explain how to make a cheap saw (less than $10) or you can buy expensive nice saws, or even just carry a small saw that coils up like cordage.  I would link these, but I feel that if you take the time to search google or just youtube, you will stumble onto many more videos that will be better than anything I post.  You can take a 20 minute journey and learn infinitely more than clicking one link that I include. 

When I was in that tree and was chopping away at a large branch, I managed to chop my way through 75% of it, but the angle thereafter made it impossible to chop the rest of the way. I was extremely tired, and already had blisters.  In order to chop the rest, I would have had to climb up even higher (I was about 25 feet off the ground, w/o a ladder, at this point) then hang down to chop the rest of the way.  That was just not going to happen, safely. So instead, I finished the limb with a regular saw I had and it was a breeze.  I instantly learned that there's a time and a place for a hatchet, and a time to put it away and break out a saw.  Save calories, save energy, save your muscles, and in some cases, be safer. I'm not shunning the hatchet, I'm merely reminding everyone, a saw is sometimes the right tool for the job.

* **Learn knots** I cannot exaggerate the importance of this enough.  Knots are knowledge that is un-rivaled in terms of power and safety.  Sure you can just tie the shit out of a rope over and over again and it will surely hold, but there's so much more to consider.

Let me paint a picture for you. You're on the edge of a cliff, or even in an urban survival scenario and are on the top of a building, and need to climb down.
You might only have a small rope available.  Maybe your daddy even taught you to tie a ""bowline"" knot (a knot that makes a non sliding loop) You think, ""I'll just tie a bowline in this, making a loop I'll throw around this tree, or chimney, and climb down""  but did you know a bowline INSTANTLY makes your rope 55% weaker?  A rope with a bowline is 45% as strong as that same rope, without.  If you only have a small rope and it needs to hold 150-200lbs down the side of a building, do you really want to risk weakening that rope?

What if you don't have a rope, but only a synthetic, elastic cordage (like a bungee cord) that will not hold a typical knot?   
Or even still, what if you need to retrieve that rope after you get down? Rope/cordage is PRICELESS in those situations.  Do you really want to leave 100 foot of it hanging off the side of something, because you dont know how to retrieve it? 

Learn knots.  They're an under-appreciated art form and their uses are ENDLESS.  The most important knots to learn, in my opinion are **""The square knot""** (not very strong, but easily untied), **""The double fisherman""** (also the double fisherman loop), **""the bowline""** and the stronger brothers of it, **""the blood knot""** (a very strong knot great for fishing, which maintains 85-90% of the cordage strength. also known as ""barrel knot""), **""The zeppelin bend""** (a fantastic way to join 2 ropes securely).  But dont stop there, learn at least 4 hitches (a way to join a rope to another object, such as a ring, branch, collar, etc). I would link these, but again, I feel searching (even if just on youtube) will take you on a much more valuable journey into other knots that will be more beneficial for many people.  

* **Make a hammock**  I'm not talking about weaving a hammock out of rope.  I'm talking about taking a large blanket, or canvas sheet and securing it with rope. Like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJlEQpcbM1I)  (this i will link, because it's the easiest and best way, imo) Also, here is a link to [THE DOUBLE FISHERMAN LOOP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyvEk8y5g_k&amp;feature=related) which the creator uses to secure the sheet.

Now this might sound retarded, but stick with me here.  Several things can be learned from making your own hammock and there are multiple uses for this type of hammock.

* 1) You learn AND PRACTICE knots.  Not only the knot that secures the rope to the sheet, but other knots that let you secure the hammock to trees, or ways to hitch the hammock to another perpendicular rope.

* 2) You can take the hammock apart, and secure the four edge, (using the same double fisherman loop) to make a nice shelter or tarp above your family

* 3) In a survival situation, you can a)have a comfortable sleeping area, b) cannibalize the whole thing for the cordage and sheeting to make even more survival items. (use the ropes to make snares or any other thing that needs cordage.  use the sheeting as moisture barriers, blankets, ground liners, even sew it or tie it as an overcoat, or clothing)
* 4) You can spend time with your kids, or loved ones making a hammock, that you can then enjoy together afterwards.  Trust me, its a wonderful thing to lay in a homemade hammock in your backyard with your kids or even a pet. I swear, its a beautiful feeling.

After a week or so, take it down, wash it, and make it again.  Make smaller ones for your kids using beach towels, or a giant one made from an old king size comforter for the entire family to lay in. Now that you know knots, you can adjust your cordage size accordingly without worry of it breaking. 

* **GO CAMPING!!!**  Take your kids camping, or just take yourself.  Get out under those stars in your homemade hammock and feel the fresh air expanding your lungs and the appreciation for a bright fire warming the soles of your feet. Sure you can practice fire starting, or preparedness, but none of that matters now, (and I'll cover these things to practice like primitive traps in the next part ""The End is in Sight"") 
For now, we're just practicing enjoying the world around us.   

The apocalypse will be a bumpy ride, but who says it can't be beautiful?

Random houses are completely gone.  I was away when our area was evacuated so I had only what was in the truck  I had water, multi knife, Hiking shoes and clothes, led light, phone and charger, dc/ac converter laptop charger and cell phone modem. Lighters, rope tarps blankets clothing assorted hand tools and a few military rations and two days worth of dog 
food.   



The red cross has come by with food and a friendly face.  
The last thing I expected was to have anyone  stop by and ask if I would like a chili dog.  Today it was beef stew served on a bed of fluffy biscuits.  I have food here but I realize why they want me to take the meals anyway. It turns out I have been sort of in a daze and both times they showed up I did not realize I was  hungry and I was glad to have someone check in.

In the house I have a lot of dried and canned food which I rotate through, but my water jugs were empty.   Understandably, I am planning to get more serious about fire preparation .

  I am home now thinking about everything and wonder if you all have questions or comments.

Would anyone have any recommendations for a windup radio?
Ive got my kit almost complete and I feel having a Radio that is also waterproof or shower proof would be very handy to have if the SHTF.
Being in Ireland, we get mostly rain as appose Sun so Solar powered radios would not be a good idea i feel.
Also if the radio had a built in light that would be cool.

Looking forward to your recommendations!

Also, I (with some co-workers) decided to redecorate our manager's cube to be an ""ice cave"" while he was on vacation climbing Mt. Hood. With this in mind I just went to Home Depot and bought a big roll.

The ground cover and ""ice cave"" worked great, but I found myself with a (pretty expensive) leftover roll of Tyvek to use up. With a little searching, I found tons of stuff to do with it.

(I have no affiliation with any of these vendors)

We've all seen this product [wrapping a house](http://i.imgur.com/WlmTi.jpg) as a moisture/vapor barrier.

You can also make [regular clothing](http://www.usplastic.com/catalog/item.aspx?itemid=23902&amp;catid=867&amp;clickid=searchresults) out of it.

You can make [saferoom/chemical/biological protective clothing](http://www.disposable-garments.com/products/Tyvek-Suits/Coveralls-with-attached-hood-and-boots_c28/) out of it.

As paper, it's great for printing [maps](https://www.materialconcepts.com/products/tyvek/tyvek-maps/) and other things on that you need to last.

Really, I can see so many thing to use this for, I'm tempted to add a bunch to my ""stock up"" supplies.

We came upon two cars that had wrecked (highway patrol already there) and noticed that one group of travelers was huddled under a canopy type tent to get some shade (heat index that day over 110), apparently they had this in the vehicle with them.  But it got me thinking if we were in a similar situation we would be in a bad shape without shade and water.

So, now I'm assembling a car kit for an emergency.  I've got a tarp, hatchet and saw, paracord, 3 gallons of water, fire starting materials, siphon hose, and other basic tools (crescent wrench, pipe wrench, screwdrivers, etc.).  Also a two candles, flashlight, blanket and roll of 42 gal contractor grade trash bags.  My question is what other supplies should I keep in the trunk? Whay first aid supplies that could withstand the summer heat?  Anything else I'm overlooking?

EDIT:  As for alocation between BOB and car kit, I'm on a tight budget and have had to scavenge some tools from the BOB to add to the car kit.  How would y'all prioritize between the two?  I tend to prioritize toward the car kit because I feel like any ""bugging out"" would be in the car and also a emergency related to the car would be much more likely?

As such, this bag is designed to allow me to walk home ~300-350 miles over the course of a month. Unfortunately, in procuring equipment, I've gone a bit overboard: the pack weighs about 52 pounds and is rather unwieldy, so I need some help in triaging it, figuring out what doesn't need to be packed and what could be substituted for something smaller and lighter.

A Kelty Redwing (50L) backpack serves as the main pack, with a small duffel bag attached to the top via carabiners. The duffel bag functions as an auxiliary bag (basically, I ran out of space), and most holds items I would put on at first ability should I have to bug out (water belt, boots, winter stuff).

I recognize the primary problems in this pack: Not nearly enough food or medical, no primary water filter (cost is the main issue here), weight, defense (looking at a Ruger Takedown and/or small 9mm pistol), and a better organization (putting all food items in one bag, water in another, etc). Anyone have advice on solving them, or recognize other issues?",,False,,t5_2qoov,1342245276.0,,,True,t3_wfdhb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/wfdhb/need_help_triaging_a_bob_get_home_bag/,

Seeing the Hunger Games got me thinking about hunting with the silent efficiency of a bow, and how nice it is to not have to announce to everyone within a several-mile radius that someone in your direction just fired off a shot. 

And suddenly I got to thinking about how aluminum arrows won't be laying everywhere, either, or carbon or wood, for that matter. Well, the wood unformed, but how the fuck to even shape? Guess I should look that up. Anyways, know of BIFL bow such as I need? (disclaimer: a bit drunk)

1372274268.0,8,self.Survivalist,1h4ler,Advice on Selecting a Power Generator,rlconkl,11,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/1h4ler/advice_on_selecting_a_power_generator/,"Recent storms have reignited my desire to get a generator for the house.

I'm trying to be less tacti*cool* and consider what ""disasters"" are most likely to affect my home/family. Spring storms have made power outages unfortunately common in my area (Midwest US) and, while maybe not immediately life threatening, could result in basement flooding, spoiled refrigerated/frozen food, an inability to run the furnace, and general inconvenience.  If the outage were to last multiple days, we'd appreciate the ability to periodically charge mobile phone batteries, radio batteries, flashlights, etc.

I've looked at typical [power consumption for devices](http://powerequipment.honda.com/generators/generator-wattage-estimation-guide) I'd like to keep running, and even without being the slightest bit intelligent about startup sequencing, I'm coming up with about ~7,500 startup / ~4,000 running wattage.

I'm curious if any of you guys can provide insight on some questions I have:

**Any group thoughts on fuel choices?**

* **Liquid Propane** tends to be my favorite option.  It can be store relatively safely (and seemingly indefinitely) in portable 20lb tanks.
* **Natural gas** is delivered to our home and would *hopefully* remain available during a power outage. Anyone have experience as to whether this is usually the case?  I'm not aware of any portable option, so these would have to be installed by a professional.
* **Gasoline** lacks in long-term storage ability, but is generally available in large quantities (before an emergency).

**Any group thoughts on portability?**

* The super light/quiet units (e.g. [Honda's EU2000i](http://powerequipment.honda.com/generators/models/eu2000i)), which I might be able to multi-purpose on camping trips have a higher [WAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor), but don't have the wattage I'd need.
* Somewhat larger units (e.g. [Generac's LP5500](http://www.electricgeneratorsdirect.com/Generac-6001-Portable-Generator/p10205.html)) are arguably *portable*, but more so in the sense that you can reposition it around your house/garage for storage.  I maintain no illusions of taking one to the beach.

**Any thoughts on brands?**

* There are definitely the well-known brands in the market: Honda, Generac.  There's also a whole host of generators from, to put it nicely, are less-known.
* Does the reliability/durability vary widely?  Is it worth paying more for the name brand?

Ideally, I'd like to keep my costs around $500. Is that unrealistic?

Any specific product recommendations?

What happens if my desired devices consume more power than my generator is capable of producing?  Will it blow an internal breaker and require a reset?  If this were to happen regularly, does it cause long-term damage to the generator?",,False,,t5_2qoov,False,,,True,t3_1h4ler,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/1h4ler/advice_on_selecting_a_power_generator/,

Recommendations?,Axle_Grease,11,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/h2huc/time_for_a_new_pack_but_what_to_choose/,"So I've been using a variety of different styles with my survivalist bunch whenever we go on bug-out trips, but I've usually been hindered by my pack. Since I'm more of an old-fashioned style I've stayed away from the modern BDU backpacks that most of my pals are using, and I've been using old surplus gear since I'm a huge fan of that stuff.

My main problem is where the fine line between practicality and how much I like the style of the pack is. I love WWII stuff or any military surplus (especially if it's plain OD green) so my first pack system was an m1953 webbing system, but that became quickly inefficient and a bit uncomfortable since I couldn't get the straps right.

My second pack (and the one I'd like to upgrade from) is an old medium ALICE pack without the frame. And it's pretty decent, but the pockets are a bit inconvenient of a size, it has a little too much wear and tear and the shape/size is a bit inconvenient. Though I do like the size of the main compartment, the auxiliary pockets need to be either bigger or smaller, and placed somewhere else, possibly on the hip.

So now here I am looking to get a new pack, but I have no idea what would be a good choice other than some modern boring boxy BDU style bag.

1358564504.0,6,self.Survivalist,16uu9v,Discussion topic: Self defense.,soviet_admin,7,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/16uu9v/discussion_topic_self_defense/,"Our main goal and purpose, as humans, is to survive. I believe this subreddit could do for some livening up.

Let's face it, if we are surviving, and are doing well, there will be those that are not doing well that will want what we have. When times are uncertain and people worry about what they will get tomorrow, they will likely want ALL that you have. Unless you are over 2 meters tall (6 foot something) and over 100kg of muscle (220lbs,) you are vulnerable to bad people that want what you have.

So lets get this rolling a bit, self defense, what are your options?

**Close combat**

No ammo needed, though you might be closer than you want, and without a *lot* of skill, you are limited to one assailant at a time. Best options would be a hatchet, machete, or other short to long cutting/slicing/hacking instrument. This is really not the ideal weapon, this will leave far more emotional/psychological scars than any other weapon, and should be considered a last resort weapon, next to your fists.

**ranged**

Bow/crossbow: Excellent short to medium range weapon, reusable ammunition assuming you don't hit rock/brick/etc and break the arrows. Requires a fair amount of skill to reliably, fatally, hit targets past 25 yards. If you have the skill, this is your weapon of choice, hands down. Keep extra strings and maybe a spare bow. Go for traditional wooden bows, recurves will eventually wear and are a pain to restring.

Firearms: unless you are in one of the less free countries, you should have at least some access to firearms. While some will be advocated, they may not be available in your country/state/provence. Don't select those.

**Pistols**

Reliable pistols are not hard to come by, lets take the top 2 most reliable pistols as an example of what to purchase, and weight the options:

Glock 19, compact, durable, will live through many tens if not hundreds of thousands of rounds, assuming you didn't get a lemon out of the factory (not likely, but it happens with all guns.) Shoots 9mm NATO, cheap round, easy to stock and practice with. For those who reload, not as recommended of a firearm due to the nature of semi-autos. Good alternatives include the XD, and MP9.

Ruger blackhawk (357), dependable, will also last many thousands of rounds, especially if shooting lead bullets and keeping velocity under 900 fps, this gun will outlive you, no matter how many hundreds of thousands of rounds put through it. If reloading, it's incredibly cheap to shoot, practice can be brought down to less than 11 cents per shot. If buying new ammo, it's 16 bucks for a box of 50 38 special instead of 11 bucks for 9mm. Alternatives would include any revolver made by a reputable manufacturer, just about any made by smith and wesson or ruger will suffice.

**Shotgun**

This is incredibly important, if you have no other long gun to bring to the table with regards to survival, bring a 12ga shotgun. Most pump action shotguns are dead reliable, but I would stick with a mossberg 500 series or a remington 870. These can take out large game out to over 200 yards with rifled slugs, and smaller game at shorter distances depending on ammo selected. 

This is an excellent all around self defense long arm with the ability to also hunt very effectively. Keep the barrel length to 20 inches or less for portability, and get the largest capacity version you can get your hands on.

Again, this should be at the top of your list of firearms to get if you can.

**Rifles**

So you have a shotgun and maybe a pistol, but you really want that higher power rifle capabilities, so what should you get?

A 22lr.

That wimpy round? Yes, that wimpy round. You can purchase it in bricks of 500 that store well and easily, and that wil last you a fair bit longer than the 20 rounds of 30-06 (or whatever else you were considering) you just bought, and at the same price. You have a shotgun and a pistol, which are perfect for protecting yourself, even with the numbers against your favor, the rifle will not improve things much, so this is a purchase for the end-game/long-run.

Okay, you got a 22? good, they're cheap, so far the most expensive thing you've bought by now was the pistol, followed by ammo, the shotgun, and the 22 rifle of your choice.

Cool, now you should get yourself one of the following, in order of importance (select the highest one you can purchase, then get ammo for it.)

* AK/AR (Yes, either will do, if you are pure urban environment, choose AR, if you plan on roughing it for a long time without access to cleaning supplies, AK)
* Mini14/30
* Mosin Nagant

And to summarize all of the above, wait until the current panic dies down before buying or your wallet will hate you. Also, practice, practice, practice.",,False,,t5_2qoov,False,,,True,t3_16uu9v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/16uu9v/discussion_topic_self_defense/,

Let's be realistic here, odds are in most actual survival situations, you are most definitely not going to have a flint/steel toy and a 10"" survival knife.

NOTE: I use zombies as a catch all Katrina-like emergency as it can apply to any location where natural or other disasters can strike(Earthquakes, tornadoes, foreign invasion, Mexican cartel, FEMA lol, you name it)

Here's a couple of realistic situations, please add:

* You have nothing but what is on you and you are thrust into a situation requiring you to improvise to survive, it could be urban, or wilderness.

* You are involved in an auto related accident/situation, case in point the CNET editor who got lost up in Oregon recently.  This could apply to being in the backwoods four wheeling and having a break down or getting stuck beyond recovery.

* You are hiking when suddenly things take a turn for the worse, you've become lost, weather has changed drastically, etc, and you are forced to survive in the wilderness.

* You are camping/backpacking when suddenly things take a turn for the worse requiring you to go into survival mode.  I split this as the  difference between this and hiking is you likely have much more gear on your person, and you are already prepared to stay in the wild.

* The zombies have come a) You are at work and have what is on your person and in your office; potentially what is in your car, b) you are out and about in your car, or in a store out of your car, c) you are home.

That said, what do you actually carry on your person, every day, everywhere you go?  (ie. EDC)  I carry a Bic lighter in spite of not smoking any more, and a Swiss Army knife.",,False,,t5_2qoov,False,,,True,t3_duxiq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/duxiq/define_survival_situation/,

Well, my dilema is this: it's nearly a two hundred dollar knife. We're both in the military and don't make a lot.

I'm 5'8"" with a 30"" waist and have trouble finding a pair of BDU-type pants that aren't huge.  I can find a suitable waist, no problem.  It's the legs- I need a pair of pants that is reasonably slim, and many of the BDUs I come across are a smaller waist with huge legs that flap around.  Does anyone know of a good fitting pair of BDU pants that are cheaply priced (less than $30)?  Not looking for a skin-tight pair of pants, just something I'm not swimming in.

Last year, a subreddit was created by /u/Alyeska2112. It was called /r/I_am_the_last_one. With over 1.4k subscribers, the subreddit was a hit and ended on its **planned** date of December 31, 2012 (the apocalypse). People wanted more, so I created a subreddit called /r/I_am_the_first_one with intentions of continuing the story after the apocalypse along with some new ""interactive"" aspects.

What made /r/I_am_the_last_one so successful was the user content. We've created unique guidelines and rules to follow. We did this by taking the most popular ""recurring themes"" found in everyone's stories and created a type of ""rendezvous"" point in which everyone comes together to understand the ""most popular"" themes and include them in their stories.

We just started again and are trying to get back up to over 1k subscribers. If you're interested, you are more than welcome to join us survivors. I hope you can share your knowledge with /r/I_am_the_first_one!

1337874205.0,1,self.Survivalist,u2vux,Bug-out bag; suggestions needed.,bender424,3,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/u2vux/bugout_bag_suggestions_needed/,"Hi everyone, it's my first time posting in there. I'd ask you all to excuse my english, it is not a language in which I'm fluent in, and most of what I learned in enlish is from 4chan so ... Well, I come to you today to ask for some advice about my bug-out bag. I've read some post on some survival forum, (most of which where from military US vet) and the only think I could see was guns and lots of them. I don't know if those guys plan to build a shleter with a gun, start a fire with a gun or eat their guns but anyways, they seem to be lacking on some of the aspect of survival.

Reading a bit around some reddit post, I figured that there was a good number of you who seem to be frankly ''the most knowleadgable people on the internet'' about this subject. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I'm pretty sure I can learn a lot from you and maybe (just maybe) I have some idea to share to you too which could be interesting.

So to start the discussion, I would like to ask you guys what do you honestly think of my bug-out bag. I'll try to make it light on the eyes by making paragraph, so here we go :

Water :

1x 10 liter MSR water bladder
2x 1 liter stainless steel water bottle

That's all there is to it, I plan to buy a water filter, but I'm afraid to buy one with a cartridge which can crack during a cold winter. Being in Canada, it can go down to -20 F (-29 C). I heard some people talking about purification tablets, and I'll admit that I know nothing about these.

Food :

3x Mountain house meals
1x MSR stainless steel cooking pot (775 ml)
1x GSI scrapper (to clean the cooking pot)

I currently ownsome moutain house meal, and plan to buy a couple of other. I found them tasty, filling and easy to prepare. Also, they fit nicely in the backpack by filling the empty space. The cooking pot is also use to boil water and store my tea (I use this backpack for hinking or just to chill innawoods nearby). I've heard of a recipe some time ago which is easy to do yourself andcontain honey, maple syrup, sugar, peanuts butter, assorted nuts, and some other things I don't remeber. the point of the recipe was to put the mixture in a ziploc, so one couls easily have tons of calories in easy reach. If someone have a similar information I'd like to hear it.

Shelter :

1x Inflatable sleeping pad
1x 50 F (10 C) rectangular sleeping bag
1x 8x10 tarp (used as a ground tarp)
1x 10x12 tarp (ued as a tarp aove the tent)
1x 3 person el cheapo tent

I plan to buy very soon (my next big guy in fact) a military sleeping bag which is confortable down to minus 40 (C or F, it's the same at this temperature). One of my friend who is in the army recommanded me this one, as it also has an included bivy sack. as for the tent, I'm wondering if a hammock wouldn't be a better idea, seeing as trees are everywhere for miles and miles.

Clothing :

4x Cotton earth-toned T-shirt
1x Short
1x Construction-grade work pants
5x Cotton underwear
6x (Probably) cotton socks
1x Cold weather jacket
1x Spring/fall hunting jacket
1x Hunting rain boots
1x Cold winter hat
1x Cold winter scarf
1x Cold winter gloves
1x Leather work gloves
1x Old pair of running shoes
1x Poncho-like jacket

I don't really know what to say of this one, I've only put together the stuff I use year-round. Any critisms or suggestion are more than welcome.

Tools : 

1x 26'' bushcraft axe
1x Hatchet
1x Sharpening stone
3x Fixed blade knife (SOG seal pup, buck 119, S&amp;W search and rescue)
1x Folding saw
1x Folding shovel
1x Leather wave multitool
1x 10'' vise-grip
1x 16'' bolt-cutter
1x 12'' pipe wrench
1x Multi-tips screwdriver
1x Set of files

After highschool, I spent two years at a trade school and I can fix a good bunch of stuff, that's why I'm tool heavy. I may be overthinking this, or maybe I need to reduce some of it, I'm all ears.

Light/fire : 

3x Bic lighters
2x Firesteel
120x Waterproof (?) matches in a waterproof case1
1x Military style light (L shaped + red light option)
1x Maglight LED (Which use AA's like the previous military light)
16x AA battery
+ a strap to put the maglight on the side of the head.

I've heard about those headlamp, but I haven't found one which run on AA's, which is important to me as te military style light is my main one. being able to reduce the light print is important if I plan to move unoticed.

Navigation :

1x quality compass
1x ''Map'' of my area printed out of google earth (in ziploc bag)

I do not own a GPS, and I don't really understand the need to, seeing as I can do the same with a map and a compass without using the battery needed for my flashlights. Maybe I'm mistaken or unaware of something as to why it is so popular.

Hyigiene/FAK :

1x Toothbrush
1x Classic bathroom towel
20x band-aid
10x Steril gauze pad
1x Elastic bandage
1x Roll of medical tape
1x Classic ointment (for small cuts and burns)

I feel that of all the area, this one is the most lacking of all. I already try it, and with the towel, toothbrush and running water I was able to keep myself as clean as needed. It's amazing to see that we don't even need toothpaste and soap to stay clean. the only compromise I had to do was to clean myself 3 times a day instead of one. As for the first aid kit, I don't remember even putting on a band-aid, but being prepared in case of injury is important even if it has never happened before.

Other : 

1x Sewing kit (very basic, but useful)
1x Crossman .177 pellet rifle
+ lubrification oil and +/- 1500 pellets
1x Small fishing kit (100' 20 lbs test, 30 hooks and some leads)
2x Spare prescription glasses
1x Small radioshack one way radio
1x Ocarina
1x 550' of small twine


If you've gone through all this or parts of it : thank you very much, and any input are welcome. I take critism well and I'm not afraid to look ignorant or dumb as per my choice of gear. I think it is important to mention that all of this goes into a large Alice pack. I also own a Obus boulder 85L pack, but I'm afraid that the zipper can fail if I load it with this much gear.

Have a nice day !

From the newsletter site:

*""""A reader who is an engineer of considerable experience says watch this one evolve carefully because it is destined to continue to grow and he shares this long (but worthy) explanation why:""""*

""Heard your mention of the oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico this morning, and you (and most everyone else except maybe George Noory) are totally missing the boat on how big and bad of a disaster this is.

First fact, the original estimate was about 5,000 gallons of oil a day spilling into the ocean. Now they're saying 200,000 gallons a day. That's over a million gallons of crude oil a week!

I'm engineer with 25 years of experience. I've worked on some big projects with big machines. Maybe that's why this mess is so clear to me.

First, the BP platform was drilling for what they call deep oil. They go out where the ocean is about 5,000 feet deep and drill another 30,000 feet into the crust of the earth. This it right on the edge of what human technology can do. Well, this time they hit a pocket of oil at such high pressure that it burst all of their safety valves all the way up to the drilling rig and then caused the rig to explode and sink. Take a moment to grasp the import of that. The pressure behind this oil is so high that it destroyed the maximum effort of human science to contain it.

When the rig sank it flipped over and landed on top of the drill hole some 5,000 feet under the ocean.

Now they've got a hole in the ocean floor, 5,000 feet down with a wrecked oil drilling rig sitting on top of is spewing 200,000 barrels of oil a day into the ocean. Take a moment and consider that, will you!

First they have to get the oil rig off the hole to get at it in order to try to cap it. Do you know the level of effort it will take to move that wrecked oil rig, sitting under 5,000 feet of water? That operation alone would take years and hundreds of millions to accomplish. Then, how do you cap that hole in the muddy ocean floor? There just is no way. No way.

The only piece of human technology that might address this is a nuclear bomb. I'm not kidding. If they put a nuke down there in the right spot it might seal up the hole. Nothing short of that will work.

If we can't cap that hole that oil is going to destroy the oceans of the world. It only takes one quart of motor oil to make 250,000 gallons of ocean water toxic to wildlife. Are you starting to get the magnitude of this? """,,False,,t5_2qoov,True,,,True,t3_bysny,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/bysny/i_got_this_gem_from_a_paid_collapse_newsletter_i/,

Recommendations?,Axle_Grease,2,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Survivalist/comments/h2hi3/time_for_a_new_pack_but_what_to_choose/,"So I've been using a variety of different styles with my survivalist bunch whenever we go on bug-out trips, but I've usually been hindered by my pack. Since I'm more of an old-fashioned style I've stayed away from the modern BDU backpacks that most of my pals are using, and I've been using old surplus gear since I'm a huge fan of that stuff.

My main problem is where the fine line between practicality and how much I like the style of the pack is. I love WWII stuff or any military surplus (especially if it's plain OD green) so my first pack system was an m1953 webbing system, but that became quickly inefficient and a bit uncomfortable since I couldn't get the straps right.

My second pack (and the one I'd like to upgrade from) is an old medium ALICE pack without the frame. And it's pretty decent, but the pockets are a bit inconvenient of a size, it has a little too much wear and tear, and the shape/size is a bit inconvenient.

So now here I am looking to get a new pack, but I have no idea what would be a good choice other than some modern boring boxy BDU style bag.
