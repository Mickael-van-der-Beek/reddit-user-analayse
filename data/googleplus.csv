Please post in the following **[Google+ thread](https://plus.google.com/101481429081175146977/posts/VGuiRq7Qcui)** (not in reddit) to confirm your redditorness.

Why do this instead of just leeching my circle list? 

1. This has a permalink (unlike circles).

2. You can add or remove your own post if you feel the need to.

3. My circle list may not always have only redditors.

4. People in my list may not want to be added.

5. It keeps your reddit username a secret somewhat.

Any suggestions - please let me know.

Most likely you will NOT get the invite right away and when you get it there's a big chance that you won't be able to get in right away. Try opening the link 5 times in a row every hour or so, that helped me with another account.
If you want an invite please PM your email address, I will not be checking any http://scr.im links, sorry but I want to send one, maybe two bulk invites tonight and that's it. I do not save anyone's email so if you're in doubt than I can't help you.****

****ATENTION****
INVITES SENT THRU THE SHARE FUNCTION DO NOT LONGER WORK FOR ME. CAN SOMEONE PLEASE VERIFY THIS INFORMATION. I WAS SENDING INVITES LEFT AND RIGHT YESTERDAY AND NOW NONE OF THE INVITES I SEND ARE BEING DELIVERED.
I WANT TO KNOW IF I'M THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN'T SEND WITH THE SHARE METHOD.
THANK YOU~!

Hey guys, I'll be sending out Google Invites to anyone that pm's me their email. After you get your Invite see the link on this post as to how to send more Invites. I'll be sending out a bulk invite every 15 minutes to whoever asked for it in a PM.

I got the following information from a link a fellow Redditor gave me.

**Note, I’ve been informed by a Googler+ that invites are rate limited by hour. So if they can’t click through that first time, they can try again later with same link. (You don’t need to resend it)

So please be patient and remember it's a Social Networking Platform so 
share with as many friends and Redditors as you can.

Guide on Sharing: http://i.imgur.com/66rMO.jpg

Edit: Guys and Gals, at 6:00PM Central US Time I'll be taking a little break. I'm glad some of you got in and for you guys still waiting just be patient.
If someone wants to take over the invites while I'm gone you're more than welcome.
I'll edit this post when I come back later. :) it's 5:22pm central right at this moment~!

Edit 2: Ok, im back 6:23pm central time~!


Edit 3: 7:17pm Central Time...gotta go to the supermarket... brb. Will post when Available~!

&gt;Let us choose which Circles can chat with us and put them automatically in our chat list.
&gt;If both we and the person we want to chat with have allowed chatting with each other, why not allow us to chat without chat invites? I know MANY people who don't use G+ because of the chat.

So, that's it. The option to enable chatting with specific circles instead of finding someone's email, inviting them and wait till they notice someone invited them to chat.

* Easier way of dragging people from one circle to another.
* Reordering circles
* Gets a little ""clunky"" sometimes, freezes up, etc..
* ""Sharing"" your circle.
* Filtering suggestion by high school / employer / etc...
* Easier to reciprocate relationships
* Too many random people following me, don't want to block them, but don't want to see them either.
* Out of sync if you add someone from the top bar, they aren't in the main page.
* Lots of duplicates in suggestions
* Inconsistent results in autocomplete.
* Import groups from gmail, orkut, etc..
* I want my vanity domain to work.

While it *appears* that some users are speedily fast-tracked to joining G+dom, some are being waitlisted for no particular reason.

After a bit of sleuthing around the internets, I found this particular link:
http://techland.time.com/2011/06/30/google-plus-me-securing-a-google-invite-isnt-easy-yet/2/

*Apparently* this means that **it might be simply a question of time whether or not your invitation will work**. The individual in the link received an invitation but could only join G+ after **""26 hours""** of waiting. I was able to join immediately, but I do not yet know what the time scale edges are.

**tl;dr  If you are stuck out of G+ and have an invite *wait at least 24-32 hours* before panicking and looking for other invites. More data will be posted here as it becomes available.

It might have a lot of advantages over Facebook, but one thing the esteemed competition has going for it is millions of active members who use it every day, and that means a lot.

But Google+ can do it. It can be a contender. It can be somebody.

But if we want to give Google+ a fighting chance (and I'm assuming that if you're in this subreddit, you do), then we need to do a little work of our own. We need to convince our families and friends to at least give Google+ a solid try.

**So let's list all the reasons people should give G+ a try, all the things that make it better than Facebook, the stuff it does better than that other social network, and the stuff it does that Facebook just doesn't.**

That way, when the time comes to tell people why they should do the ""work"" of accepting our invitations and creating a new profile, we won't be stuck hemming and hawing.

I'll start:

Google+ offers users an easy and intuitive way to group contacts into smaller circles (like Family, Coworkers, The Mad Ones, etc.). Users can then picks and choose which groups to share updates and messages with. You can send a book recommendation to just the members of your book club, and save everyone else the update. And you won't get a call from your parents or boss about that pic you posted of you slurping beer out of a stripper's belly button.

So if you've got a reason to make the switch, share it here. G+ is just a few good sales pitches from profit.

Besides, one small hit never hurt anybody, right?

Let's get 'em.

**Edit:**

So far we've got:

* Message formatting
* You can make a post to just one person
* Hangouts
    * Hangouts is a free, multi-user (up to 10 people) video chat
    * Video chat automatically knows who is chatting (or who is chatting the loudest) and gives that person precedence via the large window
    * A hangout allows all users to share certain Google products. [Youtube videos, for example, can be viewed and controlled together](http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/266334/6-things-google-can-do-that-facebook-can-t/3)
* Photo sharing
    * Instant upload to private album off Android
* Google product integration
    * Google Talk window is on Google+
* Sparks
    * In Facebook, you can become a fan of or ""like"" a product, but you can't cultivate it. [Sparks instead delivers content from the entire web](http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/266334/6-things-google-can-do-that-facebook-can-t/4)
* Sharing
    * Instantly upload photos and videos to the cloud, but decide later how to share them
    * Easily share photos, links, or posts [with only select friends](http://www.pcmag.com/slideshow/story/266334/6-things-google-can-do-that-facebook-can-t/1) using Circles
    * If someone posts/tags a picture of you then it needs your approval
* Google+ lets people leave easily",,False,,t5_2slj1,True,,,True,t3_ie6s1,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleplus/comments/ie6s1/the_advantages_of_google/,

1362140900.0,76,self.googleplus,19gjld,My Galaxy Nexus was stolen today. Two hours later I receive a photo of the thief to my Google+ instant upload folder.,,86,10,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleplus/comments/19gjld/my_galaxy_nexus_was_stolen_today_two_hours_later/,"So the story goes like this: I dropped my phone this morning and noticed it right away (my headphones were connected and the music stopped when the phone fell). The reason I didn't stop right away was that I was in process of moving my wallet from the same pocket to my bag, so I thought I had just moved to phone with the wallet. But yeah, the phone had fell to the ground. So stood there rummaging around my bag, max 5 meters from where the phone fell. I looked around and couldn't see the phone anymore. I asked a random guy to call my phone and it was on and ringing. No one picked up. Few minutes later the phone was switched off.

Fast forward two hours, I have my old phone, new SIM and passwords have been reset. All of the sudden my Google+ instant upload uploads a new photo to my G+ photo folder. It's Mr Bastardo himself with a near perfect mugshot of his face. With some help from our corporate guys I managed to get the approximate location of the device as well.

How did this happen?

The likely explanation is that as I reported the phone stolen to my employer, the security measures were turned on and as the guy tried unlocking the phone, the front facing camera took a photo automatically, which was later uploaded to Google+ instant upload. My SIM card is locked and I guess he put his own card in. Also, the phone is protected with a pattern lock so he is not able to actually sign in and use the phone.﻿

So basically, he found my phone from next to me when I was obviously looking for it, did not pick up when I called the device almost immediately and few minutes later switched off the phone. Later on, he proceeded to remove my sim card and tried to unlock the phone.

tl;dr Phone got stolen, few hours later a photo of the suspect emerges to my Google+ instant upload folder.

2. Make a post to that circle.
3. Have your friend follow you on Buzz.
4. Make a post on Buzz.
5. Have your friend click your name on that post.
6. Then they should click ""Google Profile"".
7. This will take them to your Google+ profile.
8. Now they can head over to plus.google.com and set up their account.
9. I'm not going to do that profit joke. You were probably expecting it, but this is as close as it gets in this post.

I've been using this method for all my friends, and I have yet to see it not work.

Edit: There may be a delay. This is how I got in. I did it about 13 hours after my friend posted to me. I think most of the people I let in did it within a few hours.

Edit: Also, make sure that the person getting invited has a profile at profiles.google.com. That might be a factor. Thank you, [randomtroubledmind](http://www.reddit.com/user/randomtroubledmind).

Let me know if this works for you or if you discover a missing step.

Edit: I just used this on myself to get my other account onto G+. It worked perfectly. If there's a step you don't understand, ask, and I'll try to clarify.

Edit: It looks like at least two of you have gotten in. I'm going to go eat lunch. I'll be back later. Pay it forward.

**EDIT: I JUST TRIED TO MAKE A TUTORIAL VIDEO USING BRAND NEW ACCOUNTS. IT DID NOT WORK. THIS METHOD SEEMS TO ONLY WORK IF YOU'RE AN ACTIVE USER OF GOOGLE SERVICES.

Right now, the process for me is ""receive email telling me I got an invite to a facebook event, open facebook, see what it is, comment or RSVP if necessary, open Google Calendar, input event.""

Most of my posts are public and I felt like finding a way to auto-import them to my blog. Even though there is no API yet, I don't want to resort to scraping. I dug under the hood and turns out most of it is XHR and it's JSON all the way:

You can get anyone's public posts from this url:

    https://plus.google.com/_/stream/getactivities/?&amp;sp=[1,2,""109412257237874861202"",null,null,10,null,""social.google.com"",[]]

The profile ID is 109412257237874861202. The actual JSON starts with )]}' to prevent JS/browser hacks and once you remove those, you can open Chrome's JS console and type:

    pf = *paste the entire JSON and press enter - don't type these asterisks*

If everything works, you'll get a nice array variable pf. At the console, type:

    pf[1][0]

This will show the array of public posts, I think max. 10 count. I haven't felt the urge to dig into the JS just yet or explore what the different parameters mean. I just needed the text/html from my public posts so I could mirror it on my blog without having to copy-paste. I can't wait till there is a real read/write API.

Edit: Each on the public posts in the pf[1][0] array has the following format:

    [4] = Full HTML text
    [5] = Unix timestamp followed by 3 digits for ms
    [7] = Comments
    [11] = Array of one or more links
    [11][x][3] = Title of link
    [11][x][5][1] = URL of image uploaded
    [11][x][21] = Description of link
    [11][x][24][1] = Linked URL
    [11][x][24][4] = Type: document, image, photo, video
    [11][x][41][0][1] = Thumbnail of image
    [21] = Link to Google+ page for the post

Edit 2: If you want to use PHP's json_decode function, you will have to replace all *[,* with *[""""*, and all *,,* with *,"""",* first.

Edit 3: Yay! My blog now imports new entries from my G+ posts stream.

Not necessarily the technical aspects of it (although that happens a lot as well) but rather the social/cultural ones like what's appropriate or helpful to share with whom.

I'm afraid that a month from Google+'s official launch I'll be receiving all the useless shit I have to read on facebook right now, simply because people are so used to facebook's way of communication that they don't actually put any thought into the Circles concept. Many if not most people probably won't create circles that are more specific and topical than the default *friends* and *acquaintances* circles.

Myself for example, I've created a *Gamers* circle so that nobody has to watch my posts of Deus Ex trailers to whom I wouldn't talk about stuff like that in real life. But since everybody has been brainwashed by facebook's social networking culture, people don't differentiate enough between their actual circles.

Now don't give me ""just block them!"" because that's not the point. They're not people I never want to hear from - it's just that I don't want to read *everything* from them like I have to on facebook because nobody uses the groups feature there.

What do you think? How can we step up and evolve our digital social culture into something that's more sophisticated than the muddleheaded facebook noise? Personally I think I'll tell people *""Dude, don't share stuff like this with me - this doesn't interest me in the slightest! Create a **Kitten fans** circle for this shit and do not put me in it.""* but I'm not sure if it'll be enough.

(read: guy I met on reddit 20 minutes ago) will tell you, I can apparently still send out Google+ invites.

So if you want them, post in this thread or PM me!

**EDIT:** They seem to have closed this registering loop. I (think I) can still ""invite"" people, but you'll be sitting on the queue for a while. Sorry!

**EDITEDIT:** I am thinking that this might be a time-thing. Check your invite 24 hours from now (if you didn't get in), and see what happens. If not, then we know Google has shut this trapdoor for good.

**EDITEDITEDIT:** It appears that it IS a time-based thing, do check your invites periodically over the next 72 hours. I will be continuing my script-kiddy pokes and prods into their registration server until this time Sunday, at which point I'll either give up or... something.

I mean, what if Nearby was one of the share options in my Stream? (along with ""circles"", ""extended"" and ""public"") 

I think most of my ad-hoc/geo-tagged/place-specific posts are of little interest to most people in my circles. All the less are these posts interesting to the general public.

On the other hand though, most of these posts are specifically meant for the ""nearby public"". It's when I spot a great sight, a problem on the road, an interesting shop, or a little drama or a funny anecdote that took place just there... Those are events that usually don't come along as very interesting unless you're part of the context, ie. at the location.

I love the nearby (ex-Buzz) idea, but I feel there are too few (relevant) nearby posts, at least in my town, because many people are reluctant to post all out public. If there was a ""share this post with nearby only"", it would help flourish the geo buzz.

Come to think of it, it feels kinda evident, am I overlooking some such option?

However, surely at the current time, we can all agree that it seriously lacks in some ways compared to Facebook? And, more importantly, until it fixes those problems, most computer-savvy people will hold on to their facebook accounts, and most ordinary people will not switch at all. This assumes, of course, that many of the current bugs and glitches will be worked out fairly quickly.

Here are some of the big issues I've found with it.

* Google+ does not emphasis relationships among users.

This is the primary problem I've found with Google+, and I believe it to largely be due to most of its other problems. 

Perhaps the problem is best personified in the fact that it is impossible to be ""In a relationship WITH"" someone else. It is important to remember that Facebook's relationship status is a huge aspect of the site; for the first time in modern American society, people had a way of immediately identifying the relationship status of someone else, and this feature hugely influenced Facebook's early success. Google+ needs this.

Users also cannot list friends as participating in the same class or activity as one can on Facebook. 

Additionally, new friendships are not put into the stream or in any way announced to others around individual users. This creates a problem I myself have personally experienced: I have to continually, at least for the time being, check the profiles of my friends to see if anyone I know is now using the site and I am not aware of it.


* Google+ does not have a built in, more private messaging system, and does not optimize the stream to provide for this.

Facebook essentially replaces email; Google+ has no email functionality, and is not tightly integrated with Gmail. Merely integrating with Gmail would fix this problem, but for the time being it is incomplete as a standalone communication platform.


* Google+ and Gtalk chat integration is absolutely terrible. 

People I'm in mutual circles with do not show up in my Chat list. I'm not sure if this is a bug, but it has been reported by many users so I assume it to not be so.

I cannot emphasize the importance of this:

With Facebook, it is assumed that a ""Friend request"" is a mutual agreement which allows both parties to be able to fully access each others information and provide an assured method of communication. Google+ in no way offers this level of instant assured communication. 

Perhaps a ""John Smith has added you to his circles. Would you like to add him to your circles and then be able to chat and message with him? Click Here"" notification/button would help to fix this problem.


* The profile ""Info"" page needs to change its focus.

The info page is a terrific triumph of Facebook, and Google+ utterly fails to copy it. 

When one adds someone on Facebook, their information page is the most valuable part of the deal. Instantly, I can tell the religion, political views, favorite books, movies, TV, activities, and other interests of a person. This is huge in establishing relationships between people who don't know each other too well. HUGE. 

I kind of expect a reply to this along the lines of ""Google+ isn't for people who don't know each other!""; firstly, Google+ cannot hope to succeed if it won't help establish relationships between people, but secondly, this issue doesn't just affect acquaintances. Countless times I have friended people who I genuinely consider my friends on Facebook, and then learned that they are into the same books/video games/political views/anime/activities as I am. Then, I was able to talk to them about the topic.

In other words, the interests section of Facebook brings people together in a way which is revolutionary and unique even today. It provides a kind of social resume, and Google+ just provides a weak and incomplete copy of it.


* There is no group/event functionality.

Most people stay on Facebook because of this feature. I cannot believe Google+ has not yet currently implemented it. 

For example, in order to create a Team Fortress 2 night for my friends and I, I simply created a closed Facebook group for the event. It could be given a time, the group users could instantly chat with each other or post on the wall of the event, or upload pictures. A poll was posted to help decide the times. When potential new players were found, they could simply be added to the group and instantly be caught up with the affair.

This kind of social event is simply not plausible in the same way on Google+.


* Finally: Google+ cannot beat Twitter. It can beat Facebook, and it should be trying to.

I feel that a lot of the answers to this may be along the lines of:

""Google+ doesn't need to do that! Google+ isn't *supposed* to do that!""

The point I have to make is this: If Google+ isn't supposed to do these things, it cannot hope to succeed. 

It isn't going to become the next Twitter, and by that I mean this: Google+ cannot succeed as a product which is less about personal relationships and social events and more about public relationships, celebrities, and public events. 

Twitter is well-established in this market, and has sucked it dry: most web users aren't interested in Twitter at all, let alone a newer, weaker clone of Twitter which nobody uses. They're interested in communicating with their friends in an easy and simple way. Google+ can do this for them, but it is going to need a lot of work.

I would post in the existing invite threads, but I'm not just sending out invites so I figured I would make my own post. Sorry if this is redundant. 
PM me or post your email (making sure to avoid the bots with http://scr.im/) if you'd like to try it out.

Got my account from a Redditor, so I'd like to pay it forward. :] 

Edit: I've had a few responses, so it might take me a while to get to you. Hopefully not as long as it would take if you were repeatedly pressing F5. Also, I'm not a guy, and my Google+ account isn't my real one. If you want to be circlemates, just PM me and I can give you the one I use. 

Double edit: If you could put your (hidden) email in the comments instead of PM'ing, that would make things easier.  

Triple edit: I'm not posting what I'm doing quite yet because I don't really want eight gazillion people doing the same thing. Just trying to keep the loophole open a little longer. Please, don't get mad. I'm just trying to be helpful.

x4: It looks like we might have already hit a wall. 

x5: Managed to create another dummy account, so it definitely still works for some people. I'm going to keep trying. I'm going to go back up the list and re-invite the people who got locked out. 

x6: Okay. My fingers are about to fall off. Plus I think other people can easily do what I was doing if everyone sticks to about five invites per person (too many and it STOPS WORKING until you're on another account.) So if your friends/connecs have already invited thirty people, then chances are it won't work. 

 The easiest way to invite people is to create a circle, add them by email, and post to that circle (same thing people were doing a few days ago.) This is a REALLY IMPORTANT step. Then the person needs to sign OUT of their Gmail account (sometimes going into an Incognito window helps too,) and click this link: 

https://plus.google.com/_/notifications/emlink?emrecipient=103749136366361405216&amp;emid=CPjNzOap2akCFSGP7Aod6SD3Fg&amp;path=%2Fwelcome%3Fgpinv%3DAGXbFGyzeCHydkWa5KCGOofeTi3dwv0Oua_Ucd3baqtp8XUUWhOAXxXAkRE5aoOUEH_mP2TuS52dUKsAuupwLAyaQcZJASWpcbL7ga0eYyrMVNwx9WlJXE8

You can try other notification links, but for some reason this is the only one that's worked for me/a few other people I've told. However, one guy said he didn't even need the link, so results may vary. 

Then the person will be prompted to sign in. Hopefully they should be able to. If it doesn't work, just remember that in five years Google+ will be the Myspace to some future network and you'll actively try to hide that you were the beta group. 

 I've found this works for me regardless of the time of day, and has allowed me to create accounts when other people can't get in. If you want to keep inviting people, be sure to make and invite another Gmail account of your own. Sign in to that one to keep going. 

Extremely easy. Post if it works. I'm curious to see why/how it does. And also whether I'm just magic or not. (I'm not.)

From the beginning of the service, it seems like there has been this *huge* body of photographers who joined up to get as many followers as possible. First they started making these ""lists"" to inflate their followship, then there were curated circles on Group.as that got popular, and then when the Shared Circles feature was implemented, that was buttfucked by them.

And now? Now a bunch of them have agreed on the stupidest thing I've ever heard. You know how search has encouraged people to use hashtags like on twitter? Well photographers are using those now for themes/trends like #mountainmonday and #portrait tuesday, etc.

But whereas hashtags and trending topics on twitter are made by individuals and are kind of a property of the community, these G+ photographers are joining together and assigning **""Curators"" for hashtags.** See blogs like [this](http://www.rolfhickerphotography.com/blogs/all-google-plus-photo-themes.htm) listing all of the curators.

Until Google opens G+ up to the masses it will stay lonely in there.  My 'friend' feeds are relatively quiet, but the part that keeps me engaged is the great content and insight that many incredible people are sharing publicly.  People are using G+ as blogs, photo blogs, and a means to share content (think Twitter + Opinions).

Since this is the main value proposition I'm seeing in the product at the moment, I'd love to hear about who is introducing you to new ideas, discussion and photos on G+.

Also, I am aware the above statement sounds an awful lot like Reddit :)

It's Google's new social networking site. When it was first unveiled, it already had some great features that Facebook either did not have or did not really publicize enough.


It's main selling point is 'Circles' (privacy settings based on who you want to share info with). Facebook already has this in the form of 'Friends Lists,' but the average user did not know about it until an update that happened in *late August*, well after Google Plus had taken full advantage of it.


Ultimately, I think it's like Twitter and Facebook had a glorious little baby and it learned some awesome new tricks.

**Privacy, News Feeds, and Friends**


See, with Facebook, you can organize people into friends lists and select which posts or parts of your profile you want them to be able to see or not see - you can even make these available for the public (those who aren't your friends). But if someone is not your friend, they cannot put your posts in their news feed for easy access. They have to go to your page every time. This is difficult for people who don't like having randoms as their friends or well-known people who already have 5,000 friends (the Facebook limit). Oh, and up until late August, you were unable to change the privacy settings of posts once you had already posted them.


With Twitter, you have very black-and-white privacy options. Either everyone can see your tweets or nobody can see your tweets unless that person asks to see them. For me, I don't want people seeing everything I tweet, yet when I want to @reply someone that has not specifically asked to follow me, they cannot read what I send them. Also, of course, you cannot follow what everyone is saying in response to a tweet, like you can with Google+ and Facebook.


From the start, Google+ took the best of these two social-networking websites. You have your Circles (Friends Lists) where you can manage your privacy settings on posts (and change them once posted). You have the ability to have someone's public posts on your news feed, even if they are not your friend (you put them in your circle - Google already has a default 'Following' circle available - but the other person doesn't have to put you in theirs). All conversations responding to a post are kept within a thread like on Facebook. You can keep your posts private while also being able to post on someone else's page. The @mentions feature is also available.


**The Cool Extras**

Right now, I'm really enjoying 'Hangouts.' It's like Skype, but you don't need to download a program and sign up for a whole new website. At the most, you may have to download a small plug-in from Google which only takes a moment. All you have to do is press, ""Start a Hangout"" on your homepage, set your privacy settings (in case you only want certain circles to be able to join), and bam. Your hangout will appear on your approved circles' news feeds and they can join by just clicking the button. From what I know, the maximum is 10 right now, but remember, Google+ is still in beta. ;)


I'm loving it so much because most of my closest friends have gone off to the same college/neighboring colleges within the past few weeks. I will be joining them for the Spring 2012 semester, but we can still have our silly giggles and see each other outside of random photos or videos. At first, there seemed to be a few bugs, but as of late August, the only time there is a problem is if there is a known internet connection issue with someone. Oh, and you can share YouTube videos and all watch at the same time, pretty much down to the second (even if you're popping in later than the others).


Games are also just now being implemented in a cool way, even though I don't really use social-networking websites as a source of gaming entertainment. I have only really played Angry Birds, but implemented into it is a system where you can see your friends' high scores and brag about beating someone's score. There are also some multiplayer-ish features that relate to combining scores and whatnot, but I haven't used that much.

The most important part about the games is that, from what I know, they are all secure. At this point, there isn't any question as to whether or not these companies are going to steal your information if you play their game. Also, I don't see any evidence of the pyramid scheme-type stuff you always see on Facebook (play this, get your friends to play so you can get better levels/stuff, then they have to get their friends to play...).



**TL;DR: Google+ is kicking butt and taking names... while in BETA.**

Two users can only make 1 connection, while five can make 10 connections. Sixteen can 66 connections, etc. The project is tentatively called ""The Metcalfe Project"" for that reason.

The project will revolve around a website that includes simple explanations on why Facebook is bad (objective reasons with sources, like CISPA support, privacy, etc.), reasons why Google+ is better (features and politics), and invite people to ""change the social fabric of the web in 30 days"" or something along those lines.

To participate, you post on facebook that you have decided to participate in the project and link to the site (inviting others to join as well). Then for 30 days you post everything you post on Facebook to Google+ as well, even if you have little to no people in your circles. People will not be asked to delete their facebook account or permanently move to Google+, though they can if they want.

This will hopefully have several effects:

* Introduce people to Google+ and its superior UX

* Make sure that people who join Google+ and add people to their circles will instantly have content to view and interact with from their friends.

* Increase the number of people on Google+, even if just temporarily, so that the number of connections that can be made between people will increase.

I dislike Facebook as a product and as a company and believe that there are plenty of legitimate reasons stop using their services (I moved to G+ long ago). Most people don't care and will simply go where their friends are, which explains the reluctance most people have to switching even when there are superior options. The goal is for the Metcalfe Project to ease the transition from Facebook to G+ and to raise awareness about the politics of the two companies.

I fully expect that it will start with just a tiny number of tech enthusiasts participating. But if enough people announce that they are participating, it becomes a trending topic on twitter, tech blogs pick it up, etc., it could really gain a lot of momentum. That's the idea anyway.

**WHY I NEED YOUR HELP**

We had folks from Argentina, Tokyo, Canada, and various places in the US.  

He made sure everyone got a chance to introduce themselves and then asked what we thought of the service, if it had taken time away from other social networking sites, and what we'd like to see next.  Several things were mentioned (single place to see currently running 'Hangouts', Events Calendar, collapsible comments, and more intuitive direct messaging) and Vic said they were ALL on the radar and things that are actively being worked on.  The Calendar function in particular got a strong response from Vic.

I REALLY want google+ to succeed.  I hate facebook and I've been desperate for a good social network that respects its users, give people the chance to be private, and generally is awesome.

I think that google+ can be all of those things, but they need to get off their high horse about using real names.

This is the internet folks!  Whatever you say here is basically forever.  And that means the penalty for saying the wrong thing, and having it attached to your real name ... can be severe.

What if you joked once, in bad taste, about shooting your crazy boss ... and then years later ended up not getting a job because someone was able to find your old conversations?

If we are forced to use our real names that will inherently limit much of what we say and do online ... and isn't that the exact opposite of what a social network is for?

In the few official comments released, Google has claimed that they need to sort out privacy settings for minors before they'll be able to join up.

My question is this: why has it taken 6 months (rather, more than 6 months) to come up with suitable privacy settings? Is it so complicated? Or is there a lack of motivation/will?

I'm going to speak from experience here. I'm 16 years old, and I'll be 17 in May. I have a Facebook account, which I use regularly to chat with friends. Maybe ""regularly"" is an understatement -- I'm moderately addicted. I know how to use the privacy settings, and my information is set to private. People my age are, generally, the same in these ways -- heavy users of social networking.

All of my friends at school know what Google+ is. Similarly, they've all tried to sign up for it and not been able to. Thus, they turned away and went back to Facebook.

This isn't good for Google+. I'm not saying that Google+ isn't popular, but you'd be lying if you said it was anywhere near as active or popular as Facebook or Twitter. I'm not a statistician, but I'd be willing to bet that this is due to the lack of initial ""push"" from &lt;18s.

Some argue that Facebook was initially only open to Harvard students, and then only university students. That's a piss-poor argument, and here's why: that was in the past. That was before ""social networking"" was even a thing. It's 2011 now, and everybody and their mum uses social networking. For Google+ to open with an age restriction in place is, frankly, old-fashioned.

As for me? I can't be bothered. Nobody knows when under 18s will be allowed it, but to be honest I can't care any more. Facebook lets me share with my friends and I've never had to wait for a vaguely-worded statement. I know Google+ is cool, and I'm not saying that Facebook is better, but Google has missed the boat.

I'm pretty active. I give +1s on content that I like, I comment when I feel like I have something to say, and I post original content as well as sharing things that I find incredible.

It's impressive how much my followership is still increasing day by day. I assume it's from shares of my content. But I guess there's really no way of knowing anyway!

And it's not just followers, but rank, too! I check out socialstatistics every day or two to keep tabs on what's up. Continuously impressed.

Honestly, I wouldn't be where I'm at without Reddit. I got my invite in a PM from somebody here. A lot of my followers are redditors. And it's great to have discussions with redditors as well.

If you have a big followership too, please be considerate. Try not to offend people, try not to post stupid stuff, try to promote people without much influence, try to post for different timezones, try to create original content, try to be thankful for the people who interact with your posts.

It's a fantastic community so far. Thank you for your help. I love having a forum on reddit to talk about this stuff. I'm really looking forward to the future of G+.

I’m sick of tagging people on Facebook every time I want a group of people to see something I’m sharing.  I think most people who share things with a specific group of people in mind feel the same way.  Google circles addresses this problem very nicely, but as I’m sure you’re aware getting people to Google+ in the first place so you can share it with them is the problem.  

It seems to me that we, especially those of us who use the Internet regularly, are groomed for instant gratification.  Google+, while eloquently designed and a better social networking option than Facebook, inherently cannot address this issue simply because it is new.  When you sign up there is no one there to immediately share your interests with, so most people sign up for it then forget about it.  There’s no point in checking an empty news feed every day.  It creates a sort of positive feedback cycle where no one is sharing things because people aren’t sharing things.

I believe I have an idea that will help to alleviate this; allowing one to invite someone to a specific circle.  Now I know circles are personalized for each individual, but this would give people a starting point.  Bear with me.  I would like to be able to invite a group of friends to MY [insert interest] Circle (which they could then customize, rename, etc.. for themselves) and give them the option of finding others which I already have in that circle and befriend them.  Then they could immediately start sharing things of similar interest with that group of people.  In addition they would also have access to a substantial amount of user generated content that they would be interested in.   Now there is a good reason to comeback. 

People generally tend to have mutual friends, so they would be able to cherry pick through the people I already included in this circle (with my permission of course) and have that immediate gratification that the internet craves.  Let’s face it, to the average (and even experienced)  internet user an entire new social network is overwhelming and a pain in the ass to learn and setup.  If the starting point was useful content instead of a sea of setup and personalization then a lot more people would be enticed to come back.  Then they can slowly setup their account because they have content and enjoy it.  This is a better alternative to being thrown into unfamiliar territory and expected to setup a whole new profile without a guarantee of return.

**TL;DR Invitation system that promotes immediate content of interest to the person being invited.  Invite people to a circle so they can immediately start sharing things with other people in that circle.**

I just got myself a Google+ account, and am trying to figure out how to use it. Since I have never used any social media apart from Twitter until now, I am still struggling with the basics, both with regard to the technical and cultural aspects.

If I have understood correctly (please correct me if I haven't), anything I post to one of my ""circles"" will appear on the feed of everyone belonging to this circle, regardless of whether I'm part of one of *their* circles. If I make a public post, it's the reverse: My post will only be seen by people who have added me to some circle (and to people who look directly at my account, for whatever reason).

Now for my question: What's the etiquette with regard to making public posts vs posting to some circle? It appears to me that non-public posts can easily seem rude and intrusive.

Also, i think your public stream should be viewed only on request (as in not show up in peoples stream) And a friends view on your stream should be based on the common public circles.

See the update below*

As someone that speaks 3 languages, I sometimes find myself typing in one language, and than switching to another (not necessarily English) to share a post with (or use the *+Someone's Name* trick).

With this little addon I could address the same people in different ways, and also support localized names, not just a single name. Some people register themselves under non-English names, and they are basically invisible to the system (unless you search for their name in the proper language).

##  

I could see this develop into some ""Alias"" mode where you could communicate with people under an alias you select - say it could be completely automatic (not unlike in Gmail) where you usually post with your primery alias, and you can select an alias - perhaps it has it's own avatar/profile pic - when you want to post as that alter-ego of yours.

### Update #2

It seems that you can enter your name in other languages, but that doesn't mean you can use the *+Someone* trick to include them in the post under the name they've added, nor in the sharing box. Perhaps it's used just for searching.

#### Update

It seems that this feature was there all along (or implemented so right after I requested for it), but not to waste the 3 perfect upvotes this post has so far, I'm revising the request to allow adding ""Alias""s to circles.

   I should be able to tag people in addition to circles. Make it an advanced option so as to not confuse everybody if needed. Tags can be used to determine who to send something to just like circles, but while circles are for managing levels of familiarity, tags help you sort your friends by topical interests.

    **Use case**: I want to share an article on football with the 15 people I talk sports with, but they're spread throughout different circles.

    **Why circles aren't sufficient**: I have hundreds of interests I might want to connect with people about. Making a ton of circles with the same people placed over and over would be time-consuming, would clutter things badly, would get confusing, and could muddle the privacy stuff. When I add somebody as a friend, I just type in things I know we are both interested in, and I can add those over time without big reorganizations.

2. **Opt-in option when adding to circles**

    Assuming they already have me in one of their circles, have an option to invite people to be in a given circle of mine rather than simply adding them.

     **Use case**: I'm not 100% sure if my friend is as into Android phones as I am, but we do talk about it a good bit. I'd rather have an easy way to send a message, ""Your Friend thinks you might want to see updates from a circle called ______, but he's not sure."" They can then opt in or opt out at any time, and I don't have to worry that I'm bugging them with stuff they don't care about.

3. **Customization of which circles are included in my overall stream.**

     **Use case**: I like following Notch, professional-types, etc. but I don't want that stuff to push out my friends, family, and epic bros. The only place I see the real people I know all in one place is the home screen and the overall stream since they're split in groups. I should be able to keep that kind of view minus the people I follow for very different reasons.

For example, I have different friends depending on my activity - reddit, tf2, LoL, PSN, a bunch of forums, facebook, my *actual* friends, etc.

If I wanted to add a new internet friend to say, facebook, they would have my name and personal info instantly - at the very least my name is prominent. 

In the past I'd have to create a separate facebook account for all my internet friends if I wanted to remain pseudo-anonymous. Then I'd have to check multiple facebook accounts, and since I have different names on different services it would get tedious.

So here is my idea - and I know to some this may seem ridiculous ('who cares if people know your real name') but I like to keep a little privacy until I know the person better:

Add a little Personas section, tucked away if need be, where you can create a circle called, let's say, 'LoL Friends'. Then you can edit exactly what the circle can access and HOW it looks for them - maybe you have different interests or different sites or a different name.

Then you right-click the circle and press 'generate persona code' which gives you a little code like 'a829fjs' or w/e.

Then you give this code to your LoL Friends and when they go to google+/yourcode they see your profile UNDER that persona, or they can just search up that code to find you.

After that, G+ functions as usual, you can publish stuff to only your LoL friends and they will see it, but the profile they see, your boss sees, and your friends see are completely different.

I tried to uninstall google chrome and reinstall it but the problem remains the same. Also, when trying to uninstall the googletalk feature on my computer, it freezes and doesn't uninstall and my computer freezes and I have to do a force restart on my computer.

It seemed like a time saver at first as it prevented me from having to add all my circles individually. Since, at that point, the only people I had in my circles were people I have a two-way relationship with (e.g. friends, family), it served its intended purpose to only allow people who know me to see certain information. However, as I added people I found interesting to my ""Following"" circle, the information was also shared with them. Obviously, I do not want my personal information being shared with people who I choose to follow, as following is a strictly one-way relationship.

Google+ is intended to support these types of relationships as evidenced by the default ""Following"" circle. But since this method of following people by adding them to a circle provides no differentiation between two-way and one-way relationships, the ""your circles"" option becomes useless for sharing personal information as most people, like me, will not want the profile data which is intended for people who know them personally to also be shared with the people they follow.

*Edit*: After thinking about this a bit, I've only come up with a few good solutions:

1. Add a system other than circles for followers. I think that circles are a big selling point of Google+, so this isn't an optimal solution.
1. Remove the ""your circles"" option and add a new method for grouping and filtering circles. I've seen logical rules for sharing suggested, and I think that's a good idea. So are the hierarchal circles that have been proposed. In addition to those two features, my suggestion is that Google should inplement ""sharing groups."" These would be commonly used groups that could act as a shortcut to specifying a (possibly complex) set of rules for sharing posts and profile entries multiple times.",,False,,t5_2slj1,True,,,True,t3_ilci6,http://www.reddit.com/r/googleplus/comments/ilci6/the_problem_with_the_your_circles_sharing_option/,

Help me make an active hangout subreddit, and join us over at http://www.reddit.com/r/plushangouts

1. You want to be able to publicly post your gmail/G+.

2. You want (I think?) to be able to downvote posts.

3. I'm not actually sure on your thoughts on comments saying ""+1!"" and the like.

Some more suggestions of my own:

1. We have an official reddit G+ account for us all to add. It could save us some time if we could all go to one account rather than trying to connect everybody.

2. We try to maintain the [reddiquette.](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) It is an, and I quote, ""informal expression of reddit's community values"" and I believe we should uphold it. In particular, ""**Please don't: **Announce your votes to the world. You can give constructive criticism on a comment, but avoid starting a flame war. Try, ""This comment just seems to be attacking the submitter,"" instead of, ""Go back to Digg."" Comments like ""dumb link"" or ""lol, upvoted!"" are not terribly informative. Just click the arrows.""

3. In every post that will include people's gmail/G+ you should (or must?) put in a **bold** disclaimer saying something like ""**You post your email and G+ profile at your own risk of trolls/spammers etc.**""

[Invite Button Disabled](https://plus.google.com/107117483540235115863/posts/PhJFJqLyRnm)

Unfortunately, Google disabled Invitation option (for now) after the Invite-fest on Lifehacker. Apparently a user found an alternative to this, sharing posts with accountless users (with a gmail account, but no Google+ profile) makes them receive an email with an invitation option.


**WAIT, DON'T POST YOUR EMAIL JUST YET!**

I'll be sending invitations (with the above method) to any user who PM's me with his/her email. Other users who're already invited to Google+ are requested to follow the same.

Upvote this post if you received an invitation.

Update: It will take 10-30 minutes for your account to be included in the access list, till then you'll receive this message - ""Already invited - capacity overload blah blah message, try later"".

**Update2: So far, this method has worked for some lucky users. Don't worry, you'll be included in the access list soon. This happened because of too many users trying to join Google+ at a time. Google+ is just not ready yet, it is still in field trial. Apologies to everyone who wasn't able to join Google+, I'll re-send all the invitations once this gets fixed.**

Update3: Some users mentioned that this method works only if you have a google profile, but if this still doesn't work, apparently you need to wait till the next day when google re-enables the invite button. Re-send me your PM then.

**Update4: Some users have reported that re-clicking the ""Learn more about Google+"" in the email after some time redirects them to a page which asks them to join it.**

Update5: Users who weren't able to join with this method yesterday, were able to join Google+ today, by re-clicking the ""Learn more about Google+"" link which redirected them to a page asking their personal details to continue joining Google+. I'd advise everyone to fill up their age above 18+ for now.

Hi there,

I wasn't sure where to ask this, and realize there is probably little I can do to help (given the framework of Google+), but it would be great if there was a definitive answer on it.

My issue, as a casual Google+ user (have setup several circles to my liking but don't post much), is that almost daily I get a message that I've been added to the circle of some person I've never met and have no connection with.  From a personal privacy standpoint, it's disconcerting to be searchable and get added by these folks with little recourse (other than selecting the 'block' option from the notification email, which requires me to visit each of their profiles and select 'block').  

I'd much rather not be visible on any searches (which I've attempted to do through the privacy options, but to no avail) and only be seen through communal circles.

This practice that some people have taken up, of adding people in their circle who they don't even know, leads me to have no interest in posting or using Google+ much.  Is there any way to combat this?
