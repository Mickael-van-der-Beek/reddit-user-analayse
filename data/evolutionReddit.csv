While it would have been good to stop, for now we need make sure everyone is aware how to counter act it. I actually think [~~torrenting~~ pirating is evil](http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/jun/05/how-internet-killed-porn) in a communist kind of way; but I also feel people's access to the internet is more important, that we shouldn't be monitored and I fully expect this to be implemented badly. Access to the internet is becoming a basic human right, something you need to maintain equality in social opportunity. It's unjust to break someone's internet access for what is still only a civil offence. 

&gt;The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it. *John Gilmore*

So the outfit is going to be called the [Center for Copyright Infringement](http://www.copyrightinformation.org/). 

There are 5 participating ISPs:

- AT&amp;T

- Cablevision

- Comcast

- Time Warner Cable 

- Verizon

[Sonic](http://sonic.net/) seems a decent alternative. Other than switching ISP, you have these counter strategies:

Yet the MAFIAA's attempts to curb filesharing haven't left a dent.

* The most infamous file sharing site [The Pirate Bay](https://thepiratebay.se/) still stands

     * [Pirate Bay Ready For Perpetual IP-Address Whac-A-Mole](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-ready-for-perpetual-ip-address-whac-a-mole-120528/)
     * [Pirate Bay Moves to The Cloud, Becomes Raid-Proof](https://torrentfreak.com/pirate-bay-moves-to-the-cloud-becomes-raid-proof-121017/)

&gt;[The game](http://i.qkme.me/36jgzq.jpg) is about to enter a new phase and the MAFIAA is finally making it's play with Six Strikes. Basically, the ISPs will now work in co-operation with the MAFIAA to streamline consumer shakedowns and disconnect corrupted nerds from the network. This post is about how the six strikes plan is flawed because users will simply encrypt their file sharing; but I feel there are other criticisms to be made aside from being doomed to ultimate failure.

[Access to the internet is a basic human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access). It's not just about access to torrents. Access to the internet is increasingly needed to take part in modern culture. It seems an over-reach to break someone's economic, educational and social opportunities; for what is still just a civil offense. It is crazy that we are talking about copying of an infinite supply of goods as a reason to disconnect someone. It would feel more appropriate to at least be talking about disconnecting pedophiles from the internet. But the copyright maximalists are pushing their crusade too far. They are becoming a bigger problem than the one they sought to stop. We shouldn't be impeding on the social freedoms of the many, to protect some hollywood rent seeking models. There is already a legal system ready to settle civil matters and we should keep things there. There is little reason to elevate a civil offense to a national scare. Especially at a time when wider society is at a point of debating whether it should be civil offense at all.

The scheme overly depends on an IP address as evidence. They should know from their own office networks, how hard it is to control an IP address. And I should hope they begin the Six Strikes by issuing shakedown letters to the offices of the USCongressional House, RIAA, Homeland Security, Sony, Universal, Fox and Microsoft.

* [While Drafting SOPA, the U.S. House Harbors BitTorrent Pirates](https://goo.gl/CHKbv)

* [RIAA and Homeland Security Caught Downloading Torrents](https://goo.gl/ca9ve)

* [Busted: BitTorrent Pirates at Sony, Universal and Fox](https://goo.gl/p9e18)

* [Busted: Microsoft Harbors BitTorrent Pirates](https://goo.gl/z2867)

Given the above evidence that RIAA cannot protect it's own IP, why are they scheming to hold average people to a standard they cannot achieve themselves? What stops someone from continuously spoofing someone's IP address as a means to get them blacklisted by Six Strikes? Even in cases where people are taking reasonable measures to protect their connection, they can still be vulnerable because of inherent flaws in millions of networks.

* [Hands-on: hacking WiFi Protected Setup with Reaver](https://goo.gl/oQeBY)

* [Cracking WPA using the WPS vulnerability with reaver v1.3](https://goo.gl/lCPLh)



I can see innocent people getting screwed by the MAFIAA. Without the public judicial system to keep things at least a little balanced, this will be gangster style shake downs done at an industrial pace.

During SOPA, it was a legislative fight. We needed to sign petitions, pressure congressmen, [boycott companies](http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/anti-sopa-activists-launch-godaddy-boycott/), which we did with overwhelming success. The same anti-SOPA strategies won't work in this particular battle because the six strikes strategy seeks to side step the public legislative and judicial systems; it is law by corporate cartel.

Have no doubt, this is a [cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel). It only makes sense because all the major [ISPs and MAFIAA](http://tinyurl.com/byfhgdz) corporations are on board. Verizon would be committing suicide if it decided to be Hollywood's lapdog all by itself. But with Comcast and AT&amp;T on board, it is difficult for the consumer to simply choose a better service. In effect, ISPs are limiting our service and lowering their costs while charging the same price. Without another major ISP offering an alternative, we can't do another GoDaddy boycott. They are very much saying, ""fuck you and what are going to do about it?"".

Well, they underestimate our collective ability to find shit out. Technology is the field where we hold advantage, they have made a mistake. We are evolving beyond their reach. Here is what you can do to beat the system:



**[VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network)s**

The easiest solution is to use a private VPN to encrypt your torrenting. The ISP can only log that your connecting to the VPN. The swarm can only see your VPN assigned IP. This shouldn't be too hard; and most VPN providors will have [step-by-step](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/) guides somewhere on their sites. Use a private VPN. Don't use a free VPN. Use [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN). There are numerous benefits to having all of your traffic encrypted.

* [How To Make VPNs Even More Secure](https://torrentfreak.com/how-to-make-vpns-even-more-secure-120419/)

* Make sure your DNS requests are going through your VPN connection with [DNS Leak Test](www.dnsleaktest.com)

The added bonus to using a VPN is that you can encrypt all your internet activity, not just your torrenting.



**I2P**

[I2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2p) is very interesting. There has been a renewed push to get more seeds going; so I think the I2P network is about to go through a new growth phase. Definitely something to have a second look at and keep an eye on. It is also Open Source, p2p and free. I think it has the most long term value but at this point needs another wave of early adopters.

* [Torrenting with I2P. The why and how of secure filesharing using the I2P network.](https://goo.gl/z5gDl)

&gt;**Torrents on i2p** Use the built in torrent manager, I2PSnark. On the tracker page for the torrent you want to download (in this example we are using Postman's tracker, the link to which is located at the top of I2PSnark), right click the image of a magnet and select ""Copy Link Location"". Paste this link into the bar next to the ""Add torrent"" button. After you have pasted the link, click ""Add torrent"". The torrent will now appear in I2PSnark. Press the play button next to the torrent to start downloading it. [Example](https://encrypteverything.ca/index.php/File:I2PSnark.PNG)

**Usenet**

[Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) has been around forever, mostly full of old people but old people usually have interesting things to share. If you do try Usenet, apart from the fast file-sharing, it is worth checking out the usenet newsgroups.

Keep in mind, usenet is also being targeted lately. Although it's unlikely the entire usenet network will ever be taken down.



**Retroshare**

[Retroshare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroshare) is a special little program, but can be little tricky. It really should be used as a genuine friend to genuine friend network ([F2F Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend)). But if you do have interesting friends, online or in person, Retroshare offers encrypted communication and filesharing.

* [/r/retroshare](https://pay.reddit.com/r/retroshare)

**Alternative ISPs**

If youre lucky you might have the choice to switch to an ISP that isn't participating in Six Strikes

* You can keep track of participating ISPs [here](http://www.copyrightinformation.org/about).

During SOPA, Reddit was an important player in getting the initial awareness out about the SOPA threat and generating ideas about how to respond. [/r/SOPA](https://pay.reddit.com/r/SOPA) and [/r/technology](https://pay.reddit.com/r/technology) were important places from where viral action started. Once again, we are not going to be getting help from CNN about how easy VPNs are to encrypt communication; so we need to use our social media networks as a counter balance to msm blackout. There will be lots of places on the net where people post a frustrated ""FUCK YOU Verizon"", not realizing they can simply evolve and laugh. We need to teach our friends who might be a little intimidated by the jump. This evolution of the network is fought by a million conversations between one friend to a another. The MAFIAA's Six Strike plan depends on our ignorance. But they underestimate our collective ability to find shit out.

So please - share, tweet, email, remix, repost, etc etc.

So I believe there are now four major cybersecurity bills in the senate. So the framework of the debate will be much wider than just CISPA. To remain relevant, we need to get familiar with all four. 

- [CISPA](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3523:) 

- [Cybersecurity Act 2012](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:S.2105:)

Okay. I think I've been useful to the hivemind, so now I think I deserve some soapboxing brownie points. And I shall use them to say this:

**DON'T PANIC**

The total spent by [Comcast in its pro SOPA lobbying came out to over a quarter million dollars](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/220467-comcast-spent-heavily-in-support-of-anti-online-piracy-bills). The [total spend by the pro-SOPA lobby came out to more than $100 million](http://www.publicknowledge.org/blog/why-sopa-supporters-need-secrecy-trans-pacifi). But its incredible that despite being in an age of Washington corporate takeover, we won. And we didn't do it via anarchist riots, throwing molotov cocktails at riot police. We basically just talked alot, analyzed alot, defamed a bit, then talked more. Isn't that kind of incredible? I think its pretty amazing, and so do the politicians. I think in good faith they want to pass a good security bill but because lobbying dollars buy time with politicians (if not more), they end up writing legislation that is full of weaknesses. I feel fear from them more than ""don't give a fuck"". Many are watching to see if SOPA was a one off or a new border being declared, we are being tested now. I think we should accept their challenge. 

And we don't need to fight forever. This game takes places in the context of an evolving internet. We only need to hold the line; and stop both governments and corporations from breaking the free flow of information. Because when the true meshnet emerges. We win. Checkmate.

1329430985.0,278,self.evolutionReddit,psy18,Dear Cary Sherman,Inuma,322,44,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/psy18/dear_cary_sherman/,"(In response to the [NYTimes post](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/opinion/what-wikipedia-wont-tell-you.html) )

I am an American content creator.  I do not agree with the problems of SOPA and PIPA.  You say that piracy of American movies, music, and games are a problem.  To which I have to reply... Where and in what reality?  

The music industry made an estimated [$168 billion](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120129/17272817580/sky-is-rising-entertainment-industry-is-large-growing-not-shrinking.shtml) as reported by the blog Techdirt.  In fact, all forms of entertainment have  have had significant increases in revenues despite piracy.  Piracy is not the problem here.

You say that policy makers recognized a ""constitutional imperative"" to protect ""American property"" from theft, that consumers must be protected from counterfeit products, ending your statement by saying that American ingenuity and jobs are being stolen.  All are exaggerated claims.  Songs, movies, and games have not needed to be protected as ""American property"".  Entrepreneurs and artists have found ways to make money online, not through protection, but by finding new avenues for their work.  As I speak, over $1.8 million dollars have been funded to create a new adventure game from [Double Fine](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/66710809/double-fine-adventure).  Artists used sites like [Megaupload](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2012/120123busta) for their own music.  And you hurt their ability to make money by taking away the platforms they use.  Spotify wants to come to the US?  They have to make [unnecesary compromises](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110414/10554513894/record-labels-pressure-spotify-into-being-worse-driving-users-back-to-piracy.shtml).  Better services coming to the US?    Who will discuss the secret [negotiations](http://gigaom.com/2011/12/11/why-spotify-can-never-be-profitable-the-secret-demands-of-record-labels/) that the labels demand?

Let's consider the ICE domain seizures.  Recently a [Yonjo Quiroa](http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1202/120202indianapolis.htm) was arrested for linking to unauthorized streams.  The same can be said of [Kim Dotcom](http://www.3news.co.nz/Campbell-Live-enters-Kim-Dotcoms-Coatesville-mansion/tabid/367/articleID/242116/Default.aspx), [Hana Beshara](http://torrentfreak.com/us-authorities-silence-ninjavideo-founder-rush-her-to-prison-120113/), [Richard O Dwyer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-16544335), [Bryan McCarthy](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/03/illegal-tv-streamers-heres-how-the-feds-will-hunt-you-down.ars), and [Mohammed Ali.](http://www.ice.gov/news/releases/1108/110823newyork.htm)  Has it stopped piracy?  Slowed it down?  Has the enforcement slowed people's ability to download content?

Let's focus on the [policy makers](http://motherboard.vice.com/2011/12/16/dear-congress-it-s-no-longer-ok-to-not-know-how-the-internet-works).  The majority knew **nothing** about the internet, given their high positions.  Mel Watt infamously stated: ""I don't think we can resolve this with a bunch of experts coming in.""  Who says that as the [ranking member](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Judiciary_Subcommittee_on_Intellectual_Property,_Competition,_and_the_Internet) on the Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, competition, and the internet?  Why does Lamar Smith openly admit he doesn't understand the [issue of piracy?](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/14/lawmakers-begin-sopa-retreat-positive-signs-for-free-speech-online/)

How can you ask Congress to understand the [effects of filesharing](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110721/04092915191/industry-suppressed-report-showing-users-shuttered-pirate-site-probably-helped-movie-industry.shtml) yet ignore how the music industry has increased in profitability?

Yet you claim that PIPA had no bipartisan support.  Sure it did...  By legislators that had *no* idea of what they were passing!  There were no hearings on PIPA.  Instead, the people watched the SOPA hearings with mounting horror as the hearings became a one [sided beating of Google.](http://idealab.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/11/google-takes-on-congress-in-hearing.php)

You want people to believe that [TV ads](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/hollywood-fights-internet-protest-with-tv-ad-billboard.ars) from Creative America, an astroturf group formed by the MPAA and NBC, is going to sway and assuage public opinion on being censored?  Also, the reason the TV networks didn't speak up was because the lawyers and lobbyists didn't [WANT it reported](http://www.mediaite.com/tv/even-after-blackout-protest-the-media-is-still-not-doing-its-job-in-coverage-of-sopa/).  Media Matters proved that [Tim Tebow and the British Royal Family](http://mediamatters.org/blog/201201130015) had more coverage than the growing resentment to these bills.  And who can forget Rick Cotton's insistence that this [affects only rogue sites](http://www.prisonplanet.com/reddit-co-founder-alexis-ohanian-on-sopa-its-going-to-break-the-internet.html) when Alex Ohanian was saying it would affect American sites as well?

And yet an educated lawyer like you, Mr. Sherman, continue to believe that infringement is theft.  You can infringe without [becoming a thief.](http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/473/207/case.html)

By the way, how is that [$3.2 million salary](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/stories/052211riaa) coming along?  If piracy were so bad, why do you make so much more than the artist who take record label [contracts?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=NcwgdB0NltY)

Why take away their ability to use [Megabox?](http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/24/was-megaupload-targeted-because-of-its-upcoming-megabox-digital-jukebox-service/)  Why commit [raids on DJs](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/40613/ballad-of-a-mixtape/full/) or pass laws to [invade companies in California](http://techfreedom.org/blog/2011/10/04/copyright-done-right-warrantless-factory-searches-arent-right-way-stop-dvd-piracy) without warrants?  If the idea here is to stop piracy, why do all of your actions seek to make it such a better alternative?  Also, why has your industry done so well despite piracy? 

So you ask people to support the [OPEN Act](http://keepthewebopen.com/) as introduced by Ron Wyden ad Darrell Issa?  Personally, I have reservations about this bill.  It doesn't punish companies for false infringement claims, which is a huge problem that [Universal](http://boingboing.net/2011/07/20/universal-music-accu.html) recently exposed.  Laying claim to songs that aren't theirs?  How about [black box money](http://blog.tunecore.com/2011/07/how-they-legally-steal-your-money.html) that the labels collect?  Further, recorded record sales are half their numbers in 1999 was because the RIAA's members [stopped price fixing](http://tales-of-the-sausage-factory.wetmachine.com/riaa-take-us-back-to-the-days-of-illegal-price-fixing/).  In other words, the big five at the time (now the Big Three) had a monopoly, rent seeking profit machine on CDs.  You believe people want to go back to an era which had an extreme lack of choices?

By the way... Is an iTunes download a sale or a license?  Chuck D would like to [know.](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/permalink/2011/111102chuckd)

But here's the most amazing part about your next few sentences...

&gt;Misinformation may be a dirty trick, but it works""

What about [Mitch Glazier](http://www.robotwisdom.com/issues/glazier.html) writing in language in a bill eliminating an artist's right to reclaim their copyrights?

How about all of the misleading information coming out of the RIAA in regards to these bills:

&gt;SOPA is narrowly targeted

 Currently, we've had 650 domains seized without due process and they've been US based as well as foreign websites.

&gt;SOPA protects the artists

Since it's the public, the [artists,](http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/sopa_pipa_musicians_weigh_in) the film makers the human rights activists, the [lawyers](http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/01/copyright-lawyers-oppose-sopa-and-say-it-wont-even-work.html) and [engineers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/12/internet-inventors-warn-against-sopa-and-pipa) along with a ton of companies that represent [the technology industry](https://www.cdt.org/report/list-organizations-and-individuals-opposing-sopa) (besides Google) that spoke out about this bill, we can see that a lot of people spoke out against these bill.  And let's be clear.  SOPA and PIPA are about [censorship](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111221/03420017156/how-sopa-creates-architecture-much-more-widespread-censorship.shtml).   Hollywood had to deal with censorship in the '50s with McCarthyism.  Now, the old content industries want to chill free speech in the new millenium.

 So in closing, I do agree that there needs to be more reason and not rhetoric.  There needs to be open discussion about any copyright bills affecting internet policy.  There have been 16 major copyright bills in the last 35 years.  Disney does not need to protect Mickey Mouse anymore.  Everyone knows who created the mouse.  Michael Jackson's songs being downloaded shouldn't put people in jail more than [killing him](http://thetweetwatch.com/Detail/Status/143392314386161664) (RIP Michael...)

A song is not worth $150,000 in statutory damages.

The ICE is not supposed to be the private police force of the RIAA.

So let's have an open discussion.  The tools are right there in front of you.  Youtube, Digg, Reddit, an open journal/blog... There's a number of options.  That's what it means to [Promote the sciences and useful arts.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause) Find ways to increase communication, not limit it.

Thank you Sherman, for your time.  I'm sure the internet will enjoy hearing a response.

I remember during SOPA, we slowly started building up our analysis and becoming smarter with each news cycle. 

But it seems there are agents against us now actively working to break and sideline our conversation. I didn't really notice it until recently. I tend to give good faith, so when the same questions seem to be repeating, I tend to assume it's simply a good thing and that new blood is becoming aware of our issues and seeking information. 

But I noticed recently one account who posed the same ""but explain to me if I have nothing to hide, why should I worry?"" 3 times in three different threads within the same day. It's an interesting strategy. 

It's really easy to simply be relentless with the same dumb questions in every single thread. If there is a counter-voice, run away, if you can build some momentum - and randomly, sometimes you will - run with it. It's less exhausting to take the negative position than the one for positive change.  

I wouldn't have a problem with it, but because it's so relentless, its stops the evolution of our conversation. It feels like we need to start analysis from stage 1 every single thread. This is a problem, and I wonder if there isn't merit in beginning to counter this strategy, so I'm proposing Operation Unfuck the Hivemind (OpUTH).  

**OpUTH Goal**: To win the hearts and minds of Reddit to the cause of online freedom. To protect the flow of conversation on Reddit and keep it evolving in sophistication. 

**OpUTH Strategy and Tactics**:

It is counter-productive to imagine to be able to manipulate Reddit. Never-the-less, there are key positions that we need to hold. By giving some shape to the key fronts, it helps us be more efficient with our energy. 

We need people to take these positions. 

- Data Angels

- Knights of New 

- Troll Slayers 

It's often too late to influence things by the time a thread hits the frontpage. The fight happens much earlier. None of the above can by itself work; we need all three pieces working together before things click. 

**Data Angels**

Information is what holds our online society together. Especially on Reddit, with it's basic structure as a news aggregator, we need submissions to get conversations started. 

There's lots of different ways to go about getting a decent information stream to trade into Reddit. As a start, you can take interesting stories from /r/evolutionReddit and xpost them across other sub-reddits. I also recently made a list of decent news sources:

- [Rise of Data Angels to keep the flow of information going would be good. Here's some starter links.](https://pay.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/xnirx/going_to_sleep_and_stuff_rise_of_data_angels_to/)

**Knights of /New** 

The new page is where the action is, and in a way, the first 100 upvote/downvotes are the most significant. We need our own guys manning the lines there. 

The major default /news.

- [All of the above /new](https://pay.reddit.com/r/politics+technology+worldnews+news+australia+canada+europe+unitedkingdom/new)

Bookmark the links of interest to you and check when you have time. It works better if everyone on /r/evolutionreddit is taking a little bit of time every day instead of just a few power knights. 

**Troll Slayers** 

I think this is probably my weakest point. But as a general direction, we need to get in early into threads and seed them with comments and if trolls want to challenge, then we need to compete with them. 

Remember, it's never about changing the trolls mind. This is probably impossible. Write more for the readers who might happen to come across the comment tree. It's the rest of reddit we care more about. Use the trolls as an excuse to launch a soapbox speech and dump even more information out.

Here's some solutions to stop future liars.,Joakal,158,22,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/zr936/both_parties_support_internet_freedom_in_their/,"Republican and Democrat parties both have official statements supporting Internet Freedom. 

Republicans: http://www.gop.com/2012-republican-platform_Reforming/#Item5

Democrats: http://assets.dstatic.org/dnc-platform/2012-National-Platform.pdf (PDF, 31/32, last paragraph. Or look up 'Internet Freedom') 

There's some more statements:

* [The Top American Science Questions: 2012](http://www.sciencedebate.org/debate12/)

* [Reddit: Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)

* [Where the Party Platforms Stand on Internet Issues](http://www.publicknowledge.org/blog/where-party-platforms-stand-internet-issues)

**The circlejerk**

Romney/Republicans have been terrible towards Internet Freedom in the last 4 years.

* Lamar Smith has a long history (SOPA/PIPA/etc). The most recent is [FISA FAA renewal. This is the bill that retroactively legalized NSA warrantless wiretapping.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/zovvq/internet_enemy_number_one_lamar_smith_is/)

* Other republicans have supported SOPA/PIPA, with [a lot of them withdrawing support](http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-01-18/politics/30638275_1_michele-bachmann-social-conservatives-chuck-schumer) after online protests, including the blackout event.

**The bravery** 

Ignoring the suspicious mention of intellectual property in their statements. Obama/Democrats are almost as worst towards Internet Freedom in the last 4 years.

* Obama administration tried to cover up [ACTA under National Security reasons](http://www.inquisitr.com/184832/acta-worse-than-sopa-and-classified-as-national-security-by-obama-and-bush/). 

* [Obama signed ACTA yet now opposes SOPA](http://www.webpronews.com/president-obama-doesnt-support-sopa-but-signs-acta-2012-01).

* [After blackout, most SOPA supporters are democrats](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203750404577171270036110402.html)

**Solutions**

1) Make it a vital issue of vote so that they'll avoid supporting any anti-Internet proposals during their term and adopt [Declaration of Internet Freedom](http://www.freepress.net/press-release/98986/declaration-internet-freedom-gains-momentum). However, Republicans may not be enticed due to different demographics of voters. Likewise, Democrats know that Internet voters are given, so they don't care about the voters' concerns. Look! Obama wields a lightsabre to kill SOPA while signing off ACTA! I believe this solution isn't very feasible.

2) Advocate electoral system replacement. For those that don't understand, [here's an explanation of FPTP system with cats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiHuiDD_oTk
). tl;dr: Two likely winners system make you not vote for the best candidate you want.

By making this a critical issue, the parties know this issue is the only reason you'll not care about social/economy/security issues.

But unfortunately, if they study other electoral systems, they'll see that the original two likely winner parties lose a huge amount of votes towards minor parties that better represent the voters. So, [both of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duopoly#Politics) may implicitly collude to not even mention this.

3) Do you have a better solution?

",EquanimousMind,147,21,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/16hqlb/aaron_swartz_information_is_power_but_like_all/,"Information is power. But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for themselves. The world’s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries in books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of private corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the sciences? You’ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.

There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought valiantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure their work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But even under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. Everything up until now will have been lost.

That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their colleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? Providing scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to children in the Global South? It’s outrageous and unacceptable.

“I agree,” many say, “but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they make enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it’s perfectly legal — there’s nothing we can do to stop them.” But there is something we can, something that’s already being done: we can fight back.

Those with access to these resources — students, librarians, scientists — you have been given a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world is locked out. But you need not — indeed, morally, you cannot — keep this privilege for yourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords with colleagues, filling download requests for friends.

Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been sneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by the publishers and sharing them with your friends.

But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It’s called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn’t immoral — it’s a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.

Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate require it — their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they have bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who can make copies.

There is no justice in following unjust laws. It’s time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public culture.

We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that's out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open Access.

With enough of us, around the world, we’ll not just send a strong message opposing the privatization of knowledge — we’ll make it a thing of the past. Will you join us?

1345833018.0,106,self.evolutionReddit,yrm7h,Breaking the Barriers to Democracy: the first one's the easy one,n3uromanc3r,140,34,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/yrm7h/breaking_the_barriers_to_democracy_the_first_ones/,"The United States’ Electoral College, approved in 1787, isn’t just antiquated—it’s also a barrier to true democracy.

Many arguments have been made in support of the Electoral College. For those who support it, unfortunately, most of the arguments are irrelevant or just plain flawed. For instance, proponents claim that the Electoral College benefits minorities. They believe that making the votes of each state an all-or-nothing proposition increases the likelihood that these voters will turn out and have the opportunity to make a critical difference in election results, thus necessitating that candidates court a wider variety of voters. This seems reasonable until you look at the issue from alternative angles. Consider this example: 49% (a minority) of voters in a given state might support a particular candidate but, if 51% of the population favors another, the group of 49% receives exactly 0% of the Electoral votes. This is problematic for a number of reasons. Two of the most essential problems are that: the 49% of voters in a given state make no difference on the national level—essentially, in this case, the minorities’ votes count for nothing whatsoever; additionally, when a minority group knows that its vote will amount to nothing whatsoever, that group actually has less incentive to turn out to vote. With a straight popular vote, this is not the case because the minority group will know that they actually can make a difference on the national level.



ARGUMENTS FOR THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE



The most relevant arguments in favor of the Electoral College are that it does the following:

• Prevents urban-centric victories

• Maintains the federal nature of our government

• Makes it easier to detect and ameliorate election fraud.

Unfortunately, the first argument is flawed because the all-or-nothing system actually forces the candidates to focus on large swing states, neglecting the needs of the more rural states. Maintaining the federal nature of the government is a compelling argument, but even this can be destructive. Consider the South. There was a time when black citizens were assigned only 3/5 of a vote apiece.(They weren't actually allowed to vote, but this figure was used to juice up southern states' representation in the Electoral College. This reduction in the weight of their votes makes it possible for state legislators to push through the candidates of their choice (basically, it’s addition by subtraction). This, in turn, reuces the power of its constituents and places an inordinate value on the desires of a few, elite governmental officials. Instead, with universal regulations, the value of the minority vote can be preserved. And the third argument, while certainly valid, isn’t sufficiently relevant to match up with the arguments against the Electoral College.



ARGUMENTS AGAINST THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE



Relevant arguments against the Electoral College include but are not limited to these facts:

• It devalues the national popular vote

• It gives more weight to voters in less populous states

• It discourages voter turnout

• It is a disadvantage to third parties

• In some states, there is a disincentive to vote at all

When the national popular vote isn’t the deciding factor, candidates are able to appeal to voters on a narrower range of issues. For instance, Vermont’s two votes are unlikely to affect who wins since it has only two Electoral Votes. Swing states—Ohio, Iowa, etc.—get the attention because of this all-or-nothing system, decreasing the representation of the states with fewer votes and those wherein the results can be intuited ahead of time. In this case, the smaller states aren’t the only ones to lose out: if a candidate can count of 51% of California’s vote, it can also count on 55 Electoral votes 10.2% of the national total. The 49%, on the other hand, will receive 0% of the electoral votes. For 2% of California voters to determine 10.2% of the Electoral College’s votes is a travesty. Since 2% of Californians constitute 0.12% of the nation’s population, this gives a single voter in California 415 times as much sway as he/she would have if each voter had the same influence as all the others.

This more than compensates for the arguments in favor of the Electoral College. And that’s just one issue.

While devaluing the national popular vote (which is wrong), the Electoral College also gives an inordinate amount of influence to voters in less populous states. Wyoming, for instance, accounts for 0.2% of our nation’s population, but gets 0.6 percent of its representation (also wrong). And by now, we should know that two wrongs do not make a right.

A logical extension of these two points lead to a third: the discouragement of voter turnout. A democrat living in Texas, for instance, won’t affect the results of the election in any way whatsoever, while, were California a swing state, each citizen therein could have up to 415 times that which he or she would if the election was determined by the national popular vote.

Finally, the Electoral College is a disadvantage to third parties because, in essence, they just plain won’t gather any Electoral votes. This entrenches us in a situation where the two-party system will always be in place. Even if that’s the best system, we the people should at least have the opportunity to make a change if we so desire.



WRAPPING UP



I’ve acknowledged, in just over two pages, the merits of the Electoral College and the overwhelming arguments against it. When a convincing argument against an institution can be made in only a couple of pages, and when the issue at hand has such an influence on the election of our President, it becomes clear that the issue must be addressed and the system reformed. And the continuity of this system is undemocratic, disenfranchising, illogical, and ultimately destructive. This issue deserves far, far more attention than we give it.",,False,self,t5_2tf60,1347074948.0,,,True,t3_yrm7h,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/yrm7h/breaking_the_barriers_to_democracy_the_first_ones/,

- [The ""Six Strikes"" program will be here in six weeks. How it works and what it means.](http://www.dailydot.com/news/copyright-alerts-system-six-strikes-nov-28/)

This post is about how the six strikes plan is flawed because users will simply encrypt their file sharing; but I feel there are other criticisms to be made aside from being doomed to ultimate failure. 

Access to the [internet is a basic human right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Internet_access). It's not just about access to torrents. Access to the internet is increasingly needed to take part in modern culture. It seems an over-reach to break someone's economic, educational and social opportunities; for what is still just a civil offense. It is crazy that we are talking about copying of an infinite supply of goods as a reason to disconnect someone. It would feel more appropriate to at least be talking about disconnecting pedophiles from the internet. But the copyright maximalists are pushing their crusade too far. They are becoming a bigger problem than the one they sought to stop. We shouldn't be impeding on the social freedoms of the many, to protect some hollywood rent seeking models. There is already a legal system ready to settle civil matters and we should keep things there. There is little reason to elevate a civil offense to a national scare. Especially at a time when wider society is at a point of debating whether it should be civil offense at all. 

The scheme overly depends on an IP address as evidence. They should know from their own office networks, how hard it is to control an IP address. And I should hope they begin the Six Strikes by issuing shakedown letters to the offices of the USCongressional House, RIAA, Homeland Security, Sony, Universal, Fox and Microsoft.

- [While Drafting SOPA, the U.S. House Harbors BitTorrent Pirates](https://goo.gl/CHKbv)

- [RIAA and Homeland Security Caught Downloading Torrents](https://goo.gl/ca9ve)

- [Busted: BitTorrent Pirates at Sony, Universal and Fox](https://goo.gl/p9e18)

- [Busted: Microsoft Harbors BitTorrent Pirates](https://goo.gl/z2867)

Given the above evidence that RIAA cannot protect it's own IP, why are they planning to begin holding average people to a standard they cannot achieve themselves? What stops someone from continuously spoofing someone's IP address as a means to get them blacklisted by Six Strikes? Even in cases where people are taking reasonable measures to protect their connection, they can still be vulnerable because of inherent flaws in some routers. 

- [Hands-on: hacking WiFi Protected Setup with Reaver](https://goo.gl/oQeBY)

- [Cracking WPA using the WPS vulnerability with reaver v1.3](https://goo.gl/lCPLh)

I can see innocent people getting screwed by the MAFIAA. Without the public judicial system to keep things at least a little balanced, this will be gangster style shake downs done at an industrial pace. 

During SOPA, it was a legislative fight. We needed to [sign petitions](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/response/combating-online-piracy-while-protecting-open-and-innovative-internet), [pressure congressmen](http://paulryan.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=274134), [boycott companies](http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/anti-sopa-activists-launch-godaddy-boycott/). The same anti-SOPA strategies won't work in this particular battle because the six strikes strategy seeks to side step the public legislative and judicial systems; it is law by corporate cartel. 

Have no doubt, this is a [cartel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel). It only makes sense because [all the major ISPs and MAFIAA corporations](http://www.copyrightinformation.org/about) are on board. Verizon would be committing suicide if it decided to be Hollywood's lapdog all by itself. But with Comcast and AT&amp;T on board, it is difficult for the consumer to simply choose a better service. In effect, ISPs are limiting our service and lowering their costs while charging the same price. Without another major ISP offering an alternative, we can't do another GoDaddy boycott. They are very much saying, ""fuck you and what are going to do about it?"".

Well, they underestimate our collective ability to find shit out. Technology is the field where we hold advantage, they have made a mistake. We will evolve beyond their reach. 

**VPNs**

The easiest solution is to use a private [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) to encrypt your torrenting. The ISP can only log that your connecting to the VPN. The swarm can only see your VPN assigned IP. This shouldn't be too hard; and most VPN providors will have [step-by-step guides](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/) somewhere on their sites. Use a private VPN. Don't use a free VPN. Use [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) or [IPSec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPsec) vpn tunnels. Don't use PPTP.

- [How To Make VPNs Even More Secure](http://goo.gl/W99Xl)

- [DNS Leak Test](http://www.dnsleaktest.com/)

The added bonus here is that you can encrypt all your internet activity, not just your torrenting.  

**I2P**

[I2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2p) is very interesting. There has been a renewed push to get more seeds going; so I think the I2P network is about to go through a new growth phase. Definitely something to have a second look at and keep an eye on. It is also opensoure, p2p and free. I think it has the most long term value but at this point needs another wave of early adopters.

&gt;Torrents

&gt;Use the built in torrent manager, I2PSnark. On the tracker page for the torrent you want to download (in this example we are using Postman's tracker, the link to which is located at the top of I2PSnark), right click the image of a magnet and select ""Copy Link Location"". Paste this link into the bar next to the ""Add torrent"" button. After you have pasted the link, click ""Add torrent"". The torrent will now appear in I2PSnark. Press the play button next to the torrent to start downloading it.

**Usenet**

[Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) has been around forever, mostly full of old people but old people usually have interesting things to share. If you do try Usenet, apart from the fast file-sharing, it is worth checking out the usenet newsgroups.

Keep in mind, usenet is also being targeted lately. Although it's unlikely the entire usenet network will be taken down. 

**Retroshare**

[Retroshare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroshare) is a litle tricky. It really should be used as a genuine friend to genuine friend network ([F2F Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friend-to-friend)). But if you do have interesting friends, Retroshare offers encrypted communication and filesharing.

**Alternative ISPs** 

If your lucky you might have the choice to switch to an ISP that isn't participating in Six Strikes

 - [Sonic](http://www.sonic.net/)

 - [Charter](http://www.charter.com/internet) (I am genuinely surprised by this...)
 
 - [Google Fiber](https://fiber.google.com/about/) doesn't seem to be participating; which might be interesting as Google rolls out nationally. 

 - You can keep track of participating ISPs [here](http://www.copyrightinformation.org/about). 

During SOPA, Reddit was an important player in getting the initial awareness out about the SOPA threat and generating ideas about how to respond. /r/SOPA and /r/technology were important places from where viral action started. Once again, we are not going to be getting help from CNN about how easy VPNs are to encrypt communication; so we need to use our social media networks as a counter balance to msm blackout. There will be lots of places on the net where people post a frustrated ""FUCK YOU Verizon"", not realizing they can simply evolve and laugh. We need to teach our friends who might be a little intimidated by the jump. This evolution of the network is fought by a million conversations between one friend to a another. The MAFIAA's Six Strike plan depends on our ignorance. But they underestimate our collective ability to find shit out. 

So please - share, tweet, email, remix, repost, etc etc.

I campaigned for him, donated, attended events, volunteered at phone banks, and talked him up to anyone who would listen.

Over the last 3 years I've grown increasingly disappointed in President Obama.  I recognize that he inherited an economy in free fall, and a broken clusterfuck of a political system. He has faced massive challenges and absurd obstacles (for example, a corrupt, obstructionist, do-nothing congress), but he has failed to rise to the occasion, and revealed himself to be a corporatist rather than the populist that Candidate Obama purported to be. I'm also disturbed by his hawkish, criminal meddling and murder in the Middle East and beyond, and cannot, in good conscience, support 4 more years of it.

But despite all that, I was probably still going to vote for him, because the alternative was unthinkable. I toyed with the idea of voting for a third party candidate, but like everyone, I've always heard that a vote for a third-party candidate was a waste - you're throwing your vote away.  However, I recently had a conversation with my belligerent Libertarian uncle that caused me to see things much differently. He said the Republicans and Democrats are going to win without your help, just as they always have.

In truth, you're throwing your vote away if you vote either major party. If you really want your vote to speak, to be heard, to make a difference, you should vote for a third party candidate. If we stand up and buck the establishment, the two parties that are nearly identical in all the worst ways, the idea that government must be run by the same out-of-touch, bought-and-paid-for career politicians. If we refuse to be a part of the machine, we will force people to sit up and take notice. 

Think about it, if you vote for a major candidate, you will be one of the millions, lost in a sea of sameness. But if you go Green and vote for Jill Stein, or Libertarian and vote Gary Johnson or whomever, your vote speaks so much louder, because you're one of the few engaged citizens who make the conscious choice to reject the narrative that the propagandist, sensationalist, fear-mongering media has fed you. You are taking a stand, and that is so much more meaningful than following the pack. You think the two party system is bullshit? Change it. Be bold. Be an innovator. Be a part of the revolution. Be the change you want to see in the world. 

Check out http://www.jillstein.org/green_new_deal to learn about Green Party Candidate Jill Stein's plan for a Green New Deal to put Americans back to work, and stop destroying our planet for future generations.

1344687462.0,91,self.evolutionReddit,y1n7b,Story about google censoring its search algorithm gets taken down. /r/technology not happy with mod censorship.,EquanimousMind,105,14,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/y1n7b/story_about_google_censoring_its_search_algorithm/,"It always breaks my heart to see censorship on home turf. So I'm going to post about it. To avoid accusations of vote manipulation, I'm making this a self post instead of a direct link. 

I'm posting for interest value and prefer if everyone keeps their contributions to comments and things like that. 

So the story about Google censoring its search algorithms was the [top story](https://pay.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/y0w0k/google_starts_punishing_pirate_sites_in_search/) in r/evolutionreddit as well as a host of other subs. Not weird, its a big deal. 

And there was a particularly popular thread in r/technology 

- [pentahelix: Big news: Google will begin downranking sites that receive a high volume of copyright infringement notices from copyright holders — meaning, pirate sites and porn sites will likely disappear from search results](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/y099e/big_news_google_will_begin_downranking_sites_that/)

It wasn't my submission that was pulled, and I didn't actually have a chance to even be part of the original thread. But its annoying that I didn't even get the chance to go back and see the conversation at a later date because it got pulled. Without the secondary thread bringing the issue up, I might have missed it altogether. 

- [a_dogs_mother: What happened to the huge thread about this on the front page? It was only a few hrs old.](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/y0p7w/google_to_change_search_algorithm_as_hollywood/c5r9pkj)

I'm actually not adverse to mods cleaning up the submission of spam. But the community should always trump the mod. Its entirely different to pull a thread that the community has already declared to be interesting via the upvoting/downvoting. Reddit is supposed to be a free market of ideas, if a mod has a problem with a thread, s/he needs to enter the thread and argue their own case instead of using censorship to short cut debate. 

Its weird for Reddit to fight against censorship and abuse of power when it has cancer at home. 

&gt;""As the Americans learned so painfully in Earth's final century, free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny. The once-chained people whose leaders at last lose their grip on information flow will soon burst with freedom and vitality, but the free nation gradually constricting its grip on public discourse has begun its rapid slide into despotism.

However, in the spirit of random chaos of our disintermediated plan, Tyler has emerged and is out beta testing. 

I am a little surprised. Because I had kept an eye on this and thought the consensus was that the [PM2012 peeps had spend too much time doing drugs and not enough time coding](http://galatorg.com/index.php/forum/31-tyler/1635-tyler-candidates-beta-testing?limit=6&amp;start=12#1720). 

However, it does seem after-the-fact they have realized that other Wizards have been hard at work building the foundation stones of cipherspace. Still, I was expecting more to see them angle to set up something on [I2P](http://www.i2p2.de/), [gnunet](https://gnunet.org/) or [TrouspiNet](https://github.com/Peacemaking/TrouspiNet/tree/master/TrouspiNet) for next year. But it seems someone is pushing Tyler as retroshare channel. Which isn't exactly what Tyler was supposed to be; but it represents an encrypted P2P filesharing platform that can't be censored or taken down.

I can confirm it's real, and any eR peeps who want to get faster propagation to the channel can connect to my node. It is a cute co-incidence that eR has been experimenting with retroshare recently, so this is right up our alley. 

I know some tried and hit hurdles. But it's time to get up and take another shot. Retroshare might be about to become a much more interesting platform. 

My key can be found here: 

- http://pastebin.com/9DhWMyZQ

You'll need to share your key with me before we can connect. I also highly advise people use hamachi, vpns or vps before using Retroshare. 

If your going to drop your key publicly, you can drop out the bottom line identifying your IP. We should still be able to connect as long the certs have the pgp key, sslid and location.

Ubuntu is more a gateway drug into the GNU/Linux world. It is more free-as-in-freedom than being enslaved to Microsoft or Apple; but by itself, you still lack some control over your machine.

But Ubuntu is still valuable in that it is stable and makes it easy to try out.

He also said he wouldn't sign the NDAA. They made slight edits to it--and, notably, did not fix the section he said was unconstitutional--before he signed it anyways.

Yes, of course, I realize it was a military budget and he can't line item veto. But when you have a President who will sign something after declaring it unconstitutional and threatening to veto, his threatening to veto something else loses some credibility.

Also, IIRC, he's only used the veto twice since he took office in 2009.

The senate is our last real line of defense on CISPA. I'd encourage everyone to contact their senators, and to urge everyone they know to do the same. Pro-CISPA lobbyists are pumping a ton of money into this and they have the ears of our senators.

 Mr. Reif,

As the [relative] of a distinguished MIT alumnus, I am profoundly disappointed in MIT's decision to play an active role in the overzealous prosecution of Aaron Swartz. Decisions made on behalf of your institution, to gather evidence against Mr. Swartz, and turn it over to authorities without a warrant, clearly played a part in the terrible injustice that befell him at the hands of federal prosecutors.

Mr. Swartz was one of the brightest minds of my generation, and rather than choose to nurture his genius, MIT, under YOUR leadership, actively participated in his destruction. My family has had strong ties to MIT for over sixty years, and due to the deplorable actions of MIT in regards to this matter, I am deeply appalled by what the institution has become, and so you should be. MIT played an integral role in depriving the world of all that a person with the passion, initiative, and brilliance of Mr. Swartz could have, and no doubt would have contributed. MIT participated in allowing one of your brightest and most innovative students to be essentially persecuted into bankruptcy and death. I find that nothing short of reprehensible. I am disgusted, and outraged.

I guarantee you that my family will no longer financially support MIT in any way, until responsibility is acknowledged and systemic changes are implemented. In future, I urge you to protect your students from government witch-hunts if you wish to redeem the reputation of your institution.

Sincerely,
[ninjahoevinotour]

I'll let you know if I get a response.  (highly doubtful)",,False,self,t5_2tf60,False,,,True,t3_170l0n,http://www.reddit.com/r/evolutionReddit/comments/170l0n/email_to_mit_leadership_re_aaron_swartz/,
