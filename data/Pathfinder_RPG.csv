My name is Alex Penland, and I'm an anthropology student with an awesome project.  I'm currently working on a paper about Pathfinder players, but I'd like to have more subjects than the people I've already interviewed. I've crossposted to both these subreddits in hopes of getting to as many people as possible.  I need people who play Pathfinder online (using software such as Maptools) to sit down on Skype with me for about half an hour to participate in a ""freelisting"" exercise.

The interview should follow this pattern: I'll ask you about elements of Pathfinder, and you'll give me lists of words that come to mind.  If you're willing, I'll then give you a list of terms (generated from my first round of interviews, which had nothing to do with Reddit), and ask you to sort them according to whatever categories you choose.  This second half should take about half an hour as well, depending on how intricately you choose to categorize the terms.  All in all, I estimate that it shouldn't take more than an hour of your time.  If you decide to participate, I'll give you a copy of an information sheet I've typed up that gives a full explanation of the project.

[I'll be presenting this paper at the CSAS conference in St. Louis in April](http://www.aaanet.org/sections/csas/).  Anyone who participates is more than welcome to ask me for a copy of the paper once it's done.  I'm also happy to show you the abstract, but not before we finish the exercise--I don't want it to affect the data.

PM me if you'd like to participate, and we can set up a time for a Skype interview.  Feel free to ask any questions you may have on this post, and I'll answer anything I can.  Thank you for your time!


**Edit:** Unfortunately, I am only looking for people who play online.  I don't think in-person players would skew the data too much, but because the original pool of people were all online players I'd like to keep it constant.  Also, GMs are welcome to participate as well!

I plan to design them as nice as I can (I'm an Art Director, so I should manage to make something that isn't awful), but before I get into it: Would you want such cards?

Features of the cards would include:
* School, lvl, casting time, components, etc
* Printable to Magic the Gathering size, eg; They will fit into sleeves
* Minimal use of ink
* Designed to be easy to reference for new players
* Short description of spell + page number in book

One year!

It's hard to believe that it's already been that long.  It seemed like only yesterday I was marveling at the fact that I had created a sub that had 100 subscribers, and now we're nearly at 5000! We are now the 2nd largest (that I can find anyway) PNP-system-specific subreddit! /r/dnd would be the largest by the way. Even on Reddit we're the scrappy underdog!  

I really wanted to take this opportunity to thank all of you- as cliched as it is, this sub wouldn't be anything without all of you!  The vast majority of our posts are on-topic (or at least very close to it). You've all gotten very good at reporting questionable or just straight-out illegal content, and as a group you're all a pretty low-maintenance bunch, which makes my job even easier! You guys even begrudgingly put up with my horribly out of date release list thingy I put in the sidebar, and my half-assed experimentation with a flair system (which I might revisit at some point whole-assedly).

Anyway, give yourselves a pat on the back for being a part of such an awesome community! Feel free to use this thread to give us any feedback you might have, or if you don't want to do it publicly you can always message the mods!

Thanks again, and here's to another year of /r/Pathfinder_RPG goodness!

1369767233.0,71,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1f7rof,I created and ran a courtroom drama. It was awesome!,harrypancakes,79,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1f7rof/i_created_and_ran_a_courtroom_drama_it_was_awesome/,"First the story:

* PCs come to a large walled city: River's Keep
* Gate watchmen take PCs weapons to another room for inspection, then return them
* PCs choose to go to either the rich or poor part of town
* An NPC finds them in a tavern
* NPC offers a Bracer of Armor +4 (worth 25kgp) in exchange for delivering a wax sealed letter to the other side of the city. PCs will receive the other Bracer (making a functional pair) upon delivery
* Low power thieves ambush the PCs
* A beggar asks for money
* When the PCs get to the place to deliver, no one answers, door is locked (and trapped with a Stone of Alarm)
* Unlock/untrap the door, inside a man is dead on the floor with a beautiful dagger sticking out of him, he is wearing the other bracer
* Knights show up and arrest the PCs (take weapons, the letter, the bracers, etc)

Now for the courtroom mechanics:

* The Lord of River's Keep is ill and can no longer preside over criminal charges
* A judge has been appointed to oversee, but the leaders of the 9 wards each cast one vote to convict/acquit
* To acquit, the vote must be *unanimous* aka all 9 jurors
* All votes are initially against the party (I used red/green tokens to indicate the current jury standing)
* There are 3 ways to turn a juror: Diplomacy/Bluff check (1 per PC), presenting evidence (PI), buy a better lawyer
* The DC on the CHA based check is 0, 5, ..., 35, 40 for the 9 jurors
* For every 500gp spent on a lawyer, the DCs are reduced by 5
* The party can spend up to 2000gp on a private investigator. Each 100gp buys a question to the GM to uncover evidence. Every significant piece of evidence lowers the DC by 5
* Negative DCs are automatic votes

The prosecution's case:

* The victim is the Earl of Davinsh, son of the Lord of River's Keep, the only heir
* The letter is a hit contract for the Earl, witnesses saw the PCs accept it at a tavern (it was not planted)
* The Bracer's of Armor +4 belong to the Earl, they have notable markings
* The dagger has an arcane mark that matches arcane marks on all of the PCs weapons
* The PCs were found at the scene of the crime

Evidence to uncover:

* [Weapons are not usually inspected upon entering the city](/spoiler)
* [The gate watchmen have been seen with members of the mob](/spoiler)
* [The mob control a wizard name Giasal, his mark matches the weapons](/spoiler)
* [The mob has a connection to the Marquess, now the next heir ](/spoiler)
* [The victim was killed hours before the PCs were captured](/spoiler)
* [If the PCs didn't kill all of them one can testify their location (coming from the other direction when the Earl was already dead)](/spoiler)
* [The beggar can testify their location if they gave him enough money](/spoiler)
* [Witnesses at the bar saw the PCs receive one Bracer at the tavern (indicating the Earl was dead)](/spoiler)

I let the PCs roll their CHA checks and all 5 were high enough to win 5 jurors. Then they spent their PI questions retracing their traps and uncovering the story. Each of motive, opportunity, evidence, that they could disprove I gave them a juror. Then add the lawyer cost, the last juror.

There were some great moments and we all had a lot of fun.  BB spoilers throughout:

The party was the pregen cleric, fighter, and rogue.  

In the first combat against the goblins, the rogue flanked one of the goblins and critted on her very first attack in an RPG, and that set off awesome epic noob cockiness.  She was a little unsure about the character to start, but now she loves stabbing things.

In the room with the fountain, the cleric made the check to decipher the writing on the fountain, and before I could ask, the rogue's player threw her hand up to volunteer to drink it.  She took the AC penalty and we all learned an important lesson about letting the GM finish talking.  

Things were pretty good until the water room.  They even manage to solve the fire trap.  The cleric said, ""I'll walk in with my head bowed,"" which I gave him credit for instead of crawling, same basic idea, great RPing instincts.  But in the water room, all fucking hell broke loose.  The fighter had the best swim bonus and nobody was able to get the bonus from the obelisk in the hallway because nobody could read it, so the rogue told the fighter to take his armor off so it didn't hinder him from swimming.  Good RP idea, so I let it happen.  

The fighter, naked as a jaybird, swims over to the island and the reefclaw jumps out.  WTF moment ensues.  The fighter swings at the reefclaw and rolls a nat 1, which I decided meant he dropped his sword into the water (that was my only Bastard GM From Hell moment).  It sank.  The rogue panicked and tried to throw him his armor on her turn, but failed her Strength check to get it over the pond, so that sank too.  Meanwhile, the fighter gets hit and grabbed by the reefclaw, and only has a spare short sword to defend himself.  The cleric fires a few sling bullets over and misses, and things are looking grim for the fighter, so the rogue asks if she can jump the pond.  I lay out the DC and everything for her, and she tries, but falls in the water.  Eventually she swims across and kills the reefclaw with help from a well placed sling bullet from the cleric, saving the fighter's ass, but after that the fighter refused to carry any gear for them.

They tried to ambush the arguing goblins, and the cleric tried to cast Bless on the party before they went in, and when I asked the player to describe what the spell looked like, he said it was chanting and a flash of light.  

""At the sound of your chanting and seeing the flash of light, the goblin argument stops dead.  *Who there?!*""

Extremely tense negotiations follow, unintentional introduction of dragon toy, King Fatmouth is overjoyed, lets them live.

On trying to climb the cliff, the rogue rolls two straight nat 1s and knocks herself unconscious at -2 HP.  The fighter climbs up.  ""Uh, guys, there's a rope.""

They make it up, the cleric crushes the skeletons with channel energy, and then it comes time for Black Fang.  They fanned out in the room and Black Fang fries the fighter with his breath weapon, but the acid DR from the Energy Heart reduces the damage to zero.  

Fighter get *MAD*.  Fighter *CRIT!*.  Fighter *NAT 20!!*

""OK, crit confirmed, roll damage.""

2d8 = 15, plus strength and sword bonus both times (+12 total), +2d6 dragonbane = 6 and a 5.  Total damage = 38.  Blam.

Cleric bonks the dragon on the head with her sling.  Roar.

(Much missing from all parties here....)

On the rogue's next turn, she managed to flank and deliver a killshot with her rapier.  It took three hits to kill this thing.  

After the fighter's crit, I thought I would keep Black Fang around to see if they could kill him, and they smoked him.  They barely even took damage.  I'm not planning to use him further in the campaign, so it doesn't matter that he's gone.  

They divvied up their loot and asked when we were playing again.  Success.

TL;DR (haiku):  Rogue is quite clumsy / The fighter crits on Black Fang / Cleric shakes her head.

(PDF warning)

These rules start with those from the D&amp;D 3.0 Epic Level Handbook, but expand on areas that I thought were strong and replace others that just didn't work for me or my players.

- Includes epic progressions for all 11 core classes and 8 base classes.
- Includes over 300 epic feats, many focused on keeping non-caster characters both viable and interesting.
- Epic-level magic now focuses on metamagic (with over 40 new, epic metamagic feats)

This material is 100% free and I always welcome criticism and feedback.  While I have run games using these rules and done my best to edit the document, there are doubtless both typos and oversights in game mechanics that I've missed.

I don't enjoy killing my players, I just want them to have a fair challenge, but sometimes the dice aren't on their side or they just make a really stupid mistake.

My favorite is actually fairly recent, I had a 5th level Rogue, who was extremely cocky.  And I mean he was cocky out of character....  the reason for that I guess is he was starting to amass some pretty good magic items and also, considering his previous character died to a spike pit trap (When a Kobold is taunting you from across a room, don't charge him) he was probably pretty happy to have trap-sense and would say things like ""Try getting me with traps now! haha""  so anyway, being the devious bastard that I am, I put a room on the other side of a 25 foot chasm, he could see the glint of gold coming from inside and I knew he'd go for it, I also figured he'd be the only one to attempt it since his acrobatics was so huge.  So he makes the jump, natural 20, makes it no problem.   So in the room he finds 1000gp lying on the ground and a bag of holding, but that's not all.   There was also a chest which when he saw I said ""It seems like some kind of liquid is dripping from the inside of this chest""  being cocky and thinking, ""eh, if it's a trap i'll get to roll anyway"" he walks right up to it and tries to open it...   So for the next three turns he tried ripping his hand off of the top of the Mimic..... didn't roll above 5 for those three turns.

We are basically doing the basic low level adventure of ""clear out the goblin camp.""  I think it was loosely based on the first book of the Jade Regent AP.  It had a pretty generic premise and could easily have been super boring.  But it really wasn't.  

We ran into some scouts.  Our Strix fighter wiped one out in the first round, so the other 3 bolted and managed to escape into the underbrush to warn the tribe of our invasion.  The question came up of how would goblins fend off a foe that could fly...  

And so our DM threw a squad of 6 goblins.  On stilts.  We all agreed that this was probably the most logical course of action for a goblin.  These goblins were actually able to move fairly well on stilts, since they are quite dextrous.  The problem for them was that they didn't really provide any sort of tactical advantage.  They did quite the opposite, really.  Our strix just flew a little higher, still out of their reach, and the stilts were actually tall enough that they couldn't attack our groud-based party members either.  That and we'd usually just break the stilts out from under them.  Half of them tried to run away from us after the fight started going poorly (almost immediately).  They didn't make it far though, because they were still on stilts.  Basically, it was one of the easiest encounters ever, but also probably one of the most hilariously fun and memorable encounters I've ever had.

Full story included.,Nemesis0320,60,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1cuttj/i_killed_my_first_pc_today_full_story_included/,"I had my first actual character death happen to me while DMing. It happened during a side quest I came up with almost on the spot because a player couldn't show up at the last minute. It started off with me asking the players what they wanted to do, and I went off that. I just wanted to share the experience, and ask how I did. I am going to try and fill you all in about the character as much as I can.

One of my players comes from a 'town' of arctic nomads. One day as a child she went off to explore a cave she had found while playing at the outskirts of the makeshift settlement. She came back and found that the pack had been slaughtered by a group of orcs. She did what she could to honor her parents, shed her tears, and went on. Before going, she grabbed a pack and placed what she thought she'd need to survive and went off. As she searched what remained of her people, she discovered that a few of the orcs had fallen when her tribe fought to save their lives. Along with the supplies, she armed herself with their orcich axes, and a new found hatred of the race. She couldn't carry the beat-up breastplates they still had on but she wanted ""something to help return the favor."" (her words)

Anyways, over the course of my campaign the players had a time skip, and were now much older. The elvish warrior in the group was fairly fine, and the half-elf monk that they started adventuring with was embracing his old age, but the old wizard who was with them from the beginning of their journey had passed away due to old age. The player was okay with this, and asked if he could mix his character up a bit. I played it off at though his greatest disciple idolized the man, and wanted to experience first hand the lifestyle he lived. This was pretty much my way of letting the guy play the same type of character without losing a level due to death. He didn't have all the same spells, but the ones he used most often were still there, so he was fine with it.

The elf was the one who was not present for this session, so it was just the young sorcerer savant, the half-elf monk, and the now very old woman who was feeling the fatigue of age on her body. Having the death of an old friend fresh on her mind, she started thinking that death is nothing to be afraid of, but she didn't want to pass without paying her tribal resting place a visit. The savant was ecstatic to go, and the monk preached some business about balance through atonement, so the group was off.

A few days worth of travel later, the players arrived on the outskirts of the tundra when the players found a half-orc child covered in heavy furs weeping on the side of a icy cliff. The woman calmed the child down, and told him everything would be alright if he showed them where his home was. ""I don't have a home anymore."" he managed to weep through his gnarling tusks, but he turned and pointed towards a merging point of two sheets of ice. The players missed it with their first check, but further investigation led to finding a path with bones laid down ceremonially along the makeshift walls. ""I am above killing a child, but the rest of his tribe will not fare so well. Let the kid move on as though we were never here."" She said to the group once they were out of earshout.

As they adventured down they came across a cave. At the other end of the cave was a round setting where the orcs had made their home. ""Empty torch holders surround the areas in between tents made from what looks like dire wolf pelts with fur as white as the snow. In the middle of the little grotto is an extinguished fireplace, with what appears to be decaying, unpreserved bones stacked as high up as the tents."" (from my notes) As the players ventured in further the lady placed her pack down. Putting away her enchanted axes and pulling from a pack two very old, beat up artifacts that look as though they belonged from these parts. They explored the camp and found only the remains of food that looks as though it had been sitting out for quite some time. The players came across the conclusion that the camp had been abandoned some time ago and planned on going back to see if the kid had stayed where he was.

As they turned back to enter the cave, they found that the child was there, staring at them lifelessly. As the monk moved forward to try and check up on the kid, he vanished into thin air. From the pile of bones, behind the players, a creature burst into the air. ""The creature before you appears to have the rough etymology of an orc, although his head looks more as though it were a frost elk. Though much of his skin appears to have rotted off, you can notice patches of hairy or tattooed flesh amongst the exposed mass of tendon and muscle. Where his feet would be, only exposed tibia and fibula remain, with tendons dangling off the bone. The beast gives you the same lifeless stare as its jaw slowly gasps open before letting out a ferocious, bone shaking howl. Make a wills save.""

The players started combat, and it all started off fairly well. Though none of the players made the save, the sorcerer only had one turn of fleeing, so he started by setting the Wendigo ablaze. This took care of its Regeneration, but then my players could not hit something to save their lives, pun intended. I did not think that the -2 from being shaken would make a difference. After a few rounds, I made the Wendigo scream again. I was expecting that, with the -2 to saves, they would fail the saves again. To my surprise, I was only 2/3rds correct. As though the dice were against our players, the monk and sorcerer rolled 4's for how long they had to flee. Our fighter crit her save, however, and was determined to stay. ""Whatever you do, do not turn back."" She said as she continued to fight off the beast.

The player said that he was fine with it if his character died, so I had the Wendigo finish off the woman. I have had each of the players fall unconscious this campaign, but this is the first death that I have caused while DMing. Even if the players did not have much of a chance, they had been taking out things with higher CR's all campaign, so when I thought of this I figured they'd plow through it with just a bit of challenge. I just wanted to have your feedback as to how I did. For about 40 minutes of planning, what could I have done better? What did you like about it? If your feeling up to it, tell me how your first experience killing a PC went (note that I do not consider the death of the Wizard a 'death' that I was responsible for.)

Eventually he says something, one of them rolls a 20 on sense motive on what he's saying about the artifact, and I have a huge issue: He really does believe everything he's saying, so the sense motive wouldn't do anything.

Right before I say that, I said ""dammit"" out of character. They took this to mean that he was lying. I stated that he wasn't and that that was just me, but eventually I decided to just roll with him knowing more than he was letting on.

So they decide to try and kill him. They knock him unconscious and I have a ninja throw a smokestick and save him (this was actually planned, that he had a partner and if something went wrong the partner would get him out). I did all the necessary rolls, it succeeds and he gets out. My party kinda of calls deus ex machina on it, but it was legitimately planned as an out strategy because I did eventually have the bard screwing the party over and possibly getting caught.

Now the issue is that the party decides from here to just quit that entire journey, even though they had exact directions on where to go next to find the artifact. At this point, they want to return to a big city and see what they can find. I have absolutely nothing written about this and have no idea where to go, so we ended up just ending the session.

There might be a few details left out, I'm not sure.

tl;dr my party attempted to kill a vital NPC and when he escaped they quit their quest at which point I had nothing planned or any idea of what to do, so we ended the session.

Over the last couple weeks we've been getting a bit of an increase in Piracy-like activity, and along with that a bit of confusion over what exactly constitutes piracy when it comes to Pathfinder.  After all, Pathfinder rules are published under the OGL, so that means everything is open and free and you can download .PDFs of the rulebooks, right?

**WRONG!**

Short story- *rules* are not copyrighted (for the most part, exceptions apply, see your dealer for details), *books* very much are.  

Long Story- Strap in for another *Story Time with Uncle Karthas* - Note, this is not intended to be gospel/legal advice/a totally factual recollection of the events.  I am not infallible.

So, a long time ago, Wizards of the Coast released Dungeons and Dragons 3rd Edition, and along the way at some point introduced the Open Gaming License (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Game_License) by way of releasing the System Reference Document (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Reference_Document).  This allowed 3rd party companies to publish RPGS using a familiar ruleset- the D20 rules used by 3rd edition.  Then 3.5 came out, and with that the 3.5 SRD.  Then, fast forward, and Wizard decides to not renew Dungeon and Dragon, their monthly RPG magazines then published by - Paizo Publishing.  Shortly after that, Paizo announces it will release Pathfinder- an extension of the 3.5 ruleset, using the OGL.  Without the OGL, there would be no Pathfinder, at least as we know it today.

Now, the OGL makes rules open. That's it- the basic ruleset, nuts and bolts, ""Roll 1d20 to attack, add attack bonus, get a number higher than target's Armor rating/value/whatever"". Any kind of flavor text is straight out- no gods, no history of any setting, no pictures, no nothing. That is why sites like http://www.d20pfsrd.com are allowed to exist- when you go there, you don't get scanned copies of the rule books, you get a boiled down version of the rules, some minimal flavor text for things like races and such, but that's about it.  No Paizo art, no Paizo setting.  That's what's legal to share freely. For further reference, there's always http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ 

In order for something to be considered ""Open Gaming Content"", it has to be *explicitly* published under the OGL or some version of an OGL.

So, all that aside, what's ok to share?  
* Rules  
* Non-official art  

What's not OK to share?  
* Scans of books/PDFs  
* Links to scans of books/PDFs  
* Rules without ""Product Identity"" stripped out.  

Product Identity is the lynch pin in the whole process that helps decide if something is OGL or not.  Paizo defines Product Identity as:
&gt;Product Identity: The following items are hereby identified as Product Identity, as defined in the Open Game License 1.0a, Section 1(e), and are not Open Content: All trademarks, registered trademarks, proper names (characters, deities, etc.), dialogue, plots, storylines, locations, characters, artworks, and trade dress. (Elements that have previously been designated as Open Game Content are not included in this declaration.)

For more info, see Paizo's version of the OGL at http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/openGameLicense.html

Obviously, scans of books/PDFs do not have that info stripped out.  
Hopefully that clears up some stuff! Don't pirate stuff, go buy some books!

It was so fun and had a nice comical feel to it. 

Our mission was basically to pay off our land debt so a trading company doesn't take our home. Pretty simple which lead to some pretty humorous moments. It started off with us thinking of a way to get money. So we headed off to the local tavern known as The Rusty Pipe. In there we met a dwarf who was seduced and charmed by a woman which destroyed his marriage. She ended up taking an amulet from the dwarf which he wanted back. So off we went.

I had the bright idea to set up an ambush. Have one of us pose as someone she would prey on while the others hang back and prepare for the fight. Nephelem (I think that's how it's spelled) was our lucky bait. We found her, Neph went bait mode and lured her away from the tavern (This one being The Shiny Pipe). Neph got drugged but it didn't work since he passed a saving throw. So he acted drugged. Upon entering an alley, the woman took a dagger to Neph's throat. (Me and the others were still catching up. The woman demanded Neph give her all his belongings, so he promptly agreed and dropped his pants. ""No you dipshit!"" The woman yelled. ""Your bag!"" That's when we came into the alley only to see Neph on his knees in front of this woman with his pants around his ankles and a dagger to his throat. (Not a very pretty sight, but amusing) She fled into the sewers and we followed.

Down there we fought a group of kobolds. One was killed by a fireball which promptly turned into, as the GM described, a crispy paste. (I don't know if you can imagine something that is both a paste AND crispy, but I can't.) This is where I got my first kill. Pretty much sliced a kobold right in half with my scythe. I felt good about that. Another was pinned to the wall with an arrow and we captured the last one.

To keep a long story short, we found the woman dead and fought a skeletal reptile with a scimitar. As we damaged it, the GM kept describing the amount of bone that shattered off. The amount of bone that shattered versus the amount of damage we did was too much. So by the time this skeleton had 1 HP left, it was a hand with a scimitar.

We got the amulet, sold the kobold we captured to the arena and gave the amulet back to the dwarf. So we entered as combatants in the arena. Our first fight was another group of kobolds. Low and behold, one of them was the one we captured. During this whole fight I didn't get a single hit in and got half killed. Not a proud moment for me.

Unfortunately, after the fight was finished I had to head home. The GM played my character for me, so I don't know what happened after that. But it was fun as hell and can't wait for my next game.",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_17xjrb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/17xjrb/how_my_first_game_went_for_anyone_who_cares/,

I'm the newest to this group. I'm facing a huge issue with the two experienced players who have two very well optimized characters (the party is level 13 as they just leveled up last Sunday) who can easily handle anything I throw at them, while the other half can't.

The ninja and the monk have a fighting style that leads me unable to even hit them. The ninja blows a ki point to become completely invisible (scent doesn't work with this ability) and then moves around. The monk will instantaneously dimension door in, hit, and then vanish a couple hundred feet away all in one turn.

I have thought about trying to run down ki points for the both of them, but that would mean a lot of boring battles that won't be challenging, also nothing says they won't camp out right there and sleep/meditate to regain all their ki points.

I feel like a shit GM. I can't offer a challenging battle for the experienced players and due to mobility issues the two moderate players **can't even make it to the battle**. And if they did they would have to stand back since anything they do would be useless/they could be killed in one hit. One character(one of the optimized ones) alone ended up killing a CR 15 in round.

My less optimized characters get no spotlight or action and one of the players for them is getting agitated. I want everyone to have fun but I have no idea how to handle this. Any help would be appreciated.

Help me make a rule check?,playerIII,48,3,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1k66am/creating_the_bardbarian_help_me_make_a_rule_check/,"I decided to create the Bardbarian, and upon looking at abilities I had a good laugh. But, I want to know if this is in violation of any rules I did not see.

The idea for the character is a Half-Orc multiclass Barbarian and Bard. He uses Preform (percussion) to play, using war drums.

'Cept he does not use a drum. He uses himself, the ground, and his armor for the rhythm.

But here is the catch.

He also uses *you*.

When he gets into melee range, he begins attacking you in rhythm.

From Core, emphasis mine:
&gt; Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, **but it can be maintained each round as a free action**. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. **A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round.** A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.

From this, I read that so long as the Bard is not hampered in his instrument, he could still take normal actions, like attacking. 

When he downs an opponent, he can just switch back to himself to continue the performance.

Now, there is one other thing. The Barbarians Rage. It would be shame to not be able to use it, as you cannot use mental abilities like Preform while raging.

But wait! The Urban Barbarian Archetype! 

&gt; Controlled Rage (Ex)

When an urban barbarian rages, instead of making a normal rage she may apply a +4 morale bonus to her Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater rage and +8 when she gains mighty rage. She may apply the full bonus to one ability score or may split the bonus between several scores in increments of +2. When using a controlled rage, an urban barbarian gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, **and can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills**. This ability otherwise follows the normal rules for rage.

So here we have this big strong Half-Orc angrily mauling you (in a very nice beat) dealing good damage, *and* buffing the party. 

Pretty sweet deal.

Also, orcs are mean, FYI.",outshyn,47,7,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1ic69k/so_is_the_ambush_i_sprung_on_my_players_fair_also/,"For my campaign I'm taking Vault of Larin Karr, along with Lost City of Barakus, and combining them into 1 big sandbox campaign.  I'm updating most of it to Pathfinder as I go.  I have a question (and a declaration).

**Question**

The big opening mission is to reclaim a keep that has been taken over by orcs.  The players decided to infiltrate the keep, and their characters managed to quietly wipe out 5 of the guards.  However, their next fight wasn't so quiet, and the one after that was even worse -- multiple orcs escaped, shouting and screaming as they fled.  The players were pissed about that, saying, ""Well there goes the element of surprise.""  So the PCs ran down some stairs to the dungeons below, found a room and barred the door.  I assumed they would prepare for the fight to come to them.  Instead, they went to sleep, because their healer was low on spells.

First question: how stupid is that?  I mean that seriously, not rhetorically.  Is that stupid?  That seems stupid.  Am I stupid for thinking that's stupid?

*My* thinking for the orcs went like this.  Assume you are the leader of 26 angry orcs and you just got news that the keep was infiltrated and 10 of your soldiers had been killed.  A couple of the keep rooms were now awash in orc blood &amp; body parts.  What would you do?  (Again, serious question: as a DM, what do you want these orcs to do about their dire situation?)

I felt it made good sense for the leader &amp; his 16 survivors to gather up arms, and make a room-by-room sweep of the entire place.  They wanted to find these murderous PCs, and do it with full numbers.  Down in the dungeon what do they find?  A room that is *usually* open, but it's barred and there is no answer from the guard who is supposed to be in there.  They grab torches &amp; the oil they'd been saving for pouring over the keep walls, grab a tree trunk to use as a battering ram, and they burst that door open and light up everything inside that isn't an orc.

Doesn't that make sense?

My players, however, were utterly *shocked* that they didn't get to rest 8 hours.  Like, they cannot conceive of how it makes sense at *all* for them to be attacked.  They're like, ""What, did the orcs magically *know* to come to our room?  Why would they do that?  Are they *metagaming* orcs?""

I'm so stumped by that response that I honestly couldn't respond to it.  So that's my final question: does that player response make any sense at all?  I'm currently assuming that it's just whining.  However if you guys honestly think my approach was unfair, I'll have to give it some thought.  Note: nobody has died (yet).  Most are level 4, but each is down to 10 HP or so, and we ended the game day with all of them running from the fight.  1 guy in particular probably will die, but 2 are already out of the dungeon and running.

**Declaration**

Orcs are *way* meaner in Pathfinder.  The new ""ferocity"" ability essentially gives them 12 extra hit points, because they don't go unconscious (they can fight until completely dead).  Even more, when the orcs get into negative HP, they only gain the ""staggered"" condition, but not the disabled condition (which everyone else gets at 0 HP).  So this means that if an orc is at -1 HP, and uses a standard action to swing a sword at an enemy, the orc does not take 1 HP of damage and go unconscious (as anyone with the disabled condition would).  Instead, it remains at -1 HP.  (I'm aware of the -1 HP stabilization roll, but the *additional* damage from exerting yourself doesn't apply to orcs.)  This means that orcs who go into negative hit points stay up and keep hitting much longer than expected.  These changes make a difference.

1357550025.0,43,self.Pathfinder_RPG,16426a,Best Combat Encounter I've Ever Ran,MaichenM,48,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/16426a/best_combat_encounter_ive_ever_ran/,"So I thought I'd share this with you, because it's hella badass.

Background:

The PCs are going into a Jungle to ""Rescue"" a Nobleman's son from a Coven of witches, one of whom he has fallen in love with. The Nobleman has already contacted an Inquisitor (NPC) to find the son. However, with the uncompromising nature of Inquisitors, the Noble does not trust him to bring his son back alive, and would like the players to accompany him. Inquisitors tend to be anti-magic in this world, but turns out the NPC they're traveling with is a pretty cool guy.

The PCs + NPC go to a witch camp, find the couple they're after, and disguise themselves as witches. They then go to sleep for the night, hoping to find a way to convince the son to leave in the morning.

The PCs are: A Gunslinger, an Oracle, a Magus, and a Rogue.

The buildup:

When they wake up, they find that their Inquisitor friend has been found out. He's been tied to a tree, and the witch is ranting about how his kind have persecuted them. Everyone tends to be in agreement. The Magus and Gunslinger approach, he looks at them, and whispers 'Go'. They do not. The witch starts using her hair (witch hair FTW) to torture the Inquisitor, she breaks both of his arms so that him hanging from the tree becomes especially painful.

Meanwhile, the Oracle and Rogue see the Nobleman's son, his Tiefling Girlfriend, and a few other spellcasters standing off to the side. The rogue hides in the brush, the Oracle goes and tries to talk to them, trying to convince the son to go back to his father. The conversation gets heated quickly. The Oracle casts Hold Person on the Nobleman's Son and the Rogue immediately drags the body into the brush without anyone noticing (ridiculous stealth checks). In response, the mages cast web on the oracle, light the web on fire, and then summon spiders to crawl along the burning web. They then realize that the Noble-kid's body is gone and start searching the brush for it.

Action:

What follows is a two-fold battle.

The Magus proceeds to cast spark on the witch's hair. It lights, and everyone is so panicked that they at first don't know who did it. The Gunslinger climbs the tree, and then the Magus uses Web on the crowd of Mages. They are all close enough, and close enough between two trees, that it functions. The only one not affected is the head witch, and those of them that make their reflex saves. The Magus, having made his weapon flaming, then uses spell combat to light the web by striking it. The Magus and Gunslinger are now fighting nine witches, some of whom are in a burning web.

Meanwhile, the Oracle escapes the web and then hides. Both the Rogue and Oracle are now stealthed as the spellcasters search the brush. The Rogue used a stealth check to hide the body (I allowed it) so they can't find it. There's four of them in total: A Sorcerer, Two Wizards, and an Orc Scarred Witch Doctor.

Back at the tree of Inquisitor burning:

The Gunslinger, now on the tree, cuts the bonds of the Inquisitor's rope and frees him. The Magus gets barraged by magical attacks (I just had everyone use magic missile to make it simpler) and then uses one more fire spell before taking off. Unfortunately, he ends up in a line from the furious head witch, who blasts him with a lightning bolt. Right after she does that, The Gunslinger draws her musket and shoots her, she's still not dead. The Inquisitor, despite the fact that he has broken arms, tackles her to the ground and places his weight on top of her so that her face is pressed against the burning web, 'Harvey Denting' her. I'm willing to rule that that does it. However, the Inquisitor is now in a Burning web with broken arms and is about to die. I was willing to accept that, as its a cool way for a character to go. HOWEVER, the Gunslinger then says ""I throw my grappling hook onto him, grab him with it, and then yank him out of the fire"".

To which I said ""Fuck yes.""

Meanwhile, The Oracle summons a skeleton, and it attacks the Sorceress. The Rogue uses a sneak attack on the Orc Witchdoctor, however, it's a scarred witchdoctor, as as we know, they have nothing if not HP. They do a good amount of damage and its a well-planned sneak attack, but it's still 2 versus 4. The Sorceress takes to the air and starts raining scorching ray on them. Meanwhile the two Wizards provide support and the Witchdoctor provides debuffs. They're in major trouble. Still, they manage to take down a Wizard with a well-used 'Inflict moderate wounds' (Never considered that that could be so effective).

Meanwhile, the Magus summons a rolling ball of fire to do some damage to the mages, and a lot of them, with the damage they've already taken from the burning web, die outirght. But not enough. The Gunslinger jumps down to the ground next to the Inquisitor she saved, but gets barraged with magic missiles and knocked down to -7. The Inquisitor Proceeds to pick her up, with his broken arms (I rolled to see if he could do this) and carry her into the treeline, while he himself is being barraged with magic missiles. The Magus's rolling ball of fire kills the other mages, meaning that he has just single-handedly killed 16 mages.

The Magus (who has been getting seriously lucky this fight) runs for the other battle.

Meanwhile, the Oracle and the Rogue aren't doing so hot. They can't deal with the Scarred Witch Doctor, whose strength and con are just too high for a spellcaster, and who can use a Greataxe. The Oracle uses Hold Person on the Sorceress, who is still flying, and she hits the ground hard. The other wizard is sneak attacked to death, but immediately afterward The rogue is knocked down to -5 by the Orc. Then the Magus shows up. He hits the Orc with a Shocking Grasp weapon attack. The Orc steps back, and uses hold person on the Magus, completely disabling him, but the Oracle finishes her off with another inflict moderate wounds.

The group has killed almost the entire coven of witches, and are bringing back their targets alive. (But banged up in the Sorceress's case) At the end of the fight, the party member with the highest HP was the Oracle, with 1/4 his health. Keep in mind, too, that he was also the only one left *standing.*

What made this amazing was I planned for the PCs to either choose to save their Inquisitor companion and let their quarry go, or to go after their targets and let their friend die. Both of the encounters were built for the entire group to fight one or the other. They fought *both* with a split group of two people each, and *survived*.

Though barely.

To all GMs: when your PCs are about to do something badass, take their side. There is some behavior that should just be encouraged.

1367850863.0,35,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1dskyn,Glitterdust - your interpretation please!,Multitaskingish,45,10,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1dskyn/glitterdust_your_interpretation_please/,"Hey all! I spotted the post on grease and thought it'd be interesting to bring this one up. I've always interpreted [Glitterdust](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/glitterdust.html#_glitterdust) in one way but my DM has always viewed it another. Both seem feasible and so he's said we can do either interpretation as long as I claim it first (best of both worlds really!).

So first, the spell:  
&gt;**Glitterdust**  
&gt;School conjuration (creation); Level bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2  
&gt; Casting Time: 1 standard action  
&gt; Components: V, S, M (ground mica)  
&gt; Range: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
&gt; Area: creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread  
&gt; Duration: 1 round/level  
&gt; Save: Will negates (blinding only); SR no  

&gt; A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become blinded and visibly outlining invisible things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each round at the end of their turn blinded creatures may attempt new saving throws to end the blindness effect.  
&gt; Any creature covered by the dust takes a –40 penalty on Stealth checks.  

I've always imagined this as dust that is summoned in that area which drifts down to blanket everything within the 10ft radius circle. Once it's settled that's it, it's on the floor or in your eyes. Those that are blinded will continue to be so even if they leave the area because the glittery grit is now coating them completely and, even after they've summoned up the willpower to liberally scrape their eyes clear, they'll still be covered in sticky glitter. If they try and stealth or go invisible then they get the -40 to stealth even if they are nowhere near the original radius of effect and they can no longer be blinded once they've passed their will save. On the other hand, people that walk through the area afterwards aren't affected as the glitter is now on the floor and has settled.  

My DM however, imagines it more as a floating cloud of glitter which doesn't settle but instead floats mist-like through the 10ft radius circle of effect. As such, anyone inside must roll willsave or be blinded and they must do this each round, even if they've previously passed a save. Similarly, anyone invisible or stealthy that enters the area is instantly outlined in dust. However if you leave the area then you are no-longer covered in glitter and you are unaffected by blindness as the dust doesn't settle on you, preferring to stay in the cloud.  

So my interpretation is more useful for stealth/invis breaking and for blinding someone that is moving around. The DM's version is better for more static fights as it can continually blind and reveal anyone in an area, but once people leave that area the spell has no further effect.  

Does anyone have a preffered interpretation of the rules? Or do Paizo go into more detail anywhere as to exactly how this works? Or do you simply have a better way to read it? I'd definitely be interested to hear opinions on this.

Thanks!

You should save it for after the combat!"" If you comment here telling me that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, I'll be the first to upvote you, but I want to assert that it's an oversimplification to say that heals never belong in combat. In the first place...

**If vaccines solve everything, why do we need antibiotics?**

It would be a terrible strategy to sit around waiting for allies to take damage, and then heal, but I don't think anybody is seriously suggesting that when they call the character a ""healer"" (except maybe for you crazy aasimar life oracles... seriously, you people would probably load up Pez dispensers with penicillin and hand them out to trick-or-treaters on Halloween).  

A good support cleric often starts the fight with buffs or debuffs. Personally I prefer buffs because Bless is guaranteed to work, but Bane can be resisted with a will save. Then you proceed to pelt your enemies with other things as-needed, like Dispel Magic or dire wolves. You could throw in some battlefield manipulation or evocations if you like, but the wizard probably does them better, at least at low levels. If you're out of things to do and/or playing CoDzilla, you could go whack something with a mace. But *sooner or later*, something is going to get through. Sometimes you can afford to ignore the wizard's arterial bleeding and keep fighting, but sometimes you can't. If your enemies are smart, they'll focus fire on the PC who is most important to winning the encounter. If the dying player is better suited to winning this encounter, then the most efficient use of your action economy just became keeping that character alive. Fortunately...

**Good healing is cheap**

All it takes to heal well as a positive energy cleric is a single feat (selective channeling) and 12-14 charisma. Everything else is just icing on the cake--you don't need to pick domains for it, prepare any spells, buy any magic items, or waste feat slots beyond the first level. 

I often see the complaint that it's just spending an action to rewind the opponent's action. That does sound like a bad deal. The output of magical healing is probably not going to exceed the damage capacity of a level-appropriate enemy--in fact the healing may be less. But I think this wisdom is somewhat of a hold-over from D&amp;D 3.5, because with channel energy, you're not just rewinding one hostile action if you're healing 4-5 PCs. If your allies are good, then keeping them on their feet for just one more round can enable that final push that takes the battle from a close call to just a matter of mopping up.

There are some easy tricks to make healing more effective too. Do enemies consistently see your armor and decide to go after the squishy rogue instead? Shield Other is a godsend spell in these cases because you can spread out the damage and channel energy effectively heals twice as much when it's divided between two people, meaning that you can channel half as often and spend more turns dropping pillars of heavenly fire from the sky. AC buffs also act as a power multiplier on heals, because if the enemy only hits on two rounds out of three, then that heal just reversed 1.5 turns worth of work, rather than 1.0 turns.

**In conclusion**

Healing during combat is not the be-all-and-end-all of Pathfinder power playing practices, but there is a time and a place where it is appropriate. If you're playing with a small group, or if you're trying to be the kind of CoDzilla that steals the spotlight in every encounter, then healing won't be as good for you (and I'm not even going to get into the positive/negative energy debate, other than to repeat that I would rather have a guaranteed effect than one that allows a saving throw). But you can do some decent, timely healing as a cleric with very little specialization, and if you have allies worth their salt, then keeping them up is probably a good investment, unless you have another action up your sleeve that will single-handedly finish the encounter.

tl;dr: Healing isn't bad; it's situational.",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_1h4lod,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1h4lod/in_defense_of_combat_medics/,

We've been playing Carrion Crown. Due to real life issues, our Wizard player had to leave the group after the close of the first book's adventure, leaving us with a Bard, a Monk, and Inquisitor, a Paladin, and a Rogue. Lots of buff and healing, not much in the way of Arcane ""blast"" power -- and no one really well-positioned for item creation feats.

Although treasure has been pouring in at the module-prescribed rate, we really haven't had much time to engage anyone's services to create any items for us -- and although the module does provide items, they often aren't tailored to the group's specific needs.

In the second book the GM let us ""commission"" a Handy Haversack (one of my favourite items), but let us know that it would take 1 week and a Knowledge Local at DC 20 to find any further available magical crafters for anything but 1st and 2nd lvl potions, and that said crafting would take one or more weeks. We were cool with that -- we were low level, and there had been enough +1 things laying around to keep us amused, for the most part. After all, the GM is the GM, right?

The second book passed, and we raced straight into the third book, the relentless pace of the adventure pulling us on. The GM gave us a bit of a brake, we know have a clean-up crew of Dwarven apprentices (their master being killed due to our error in judgement and degree of danger) who we give the ""Vendor Trash"" to. They carry it to market towns, and pocket a commission, and save us time that we haven't been allowed.

However this week we raced pell-mell to the fourth adventure. Many of us are 9th lvl (those trailing behind have missed a number of sessions, and they're all 8th lvl, a touch behind the ""recommended"" zone for the fourth book, but only by a session or two). However -- we're still armed with a collection of +1 items and a smattering of +2's -- often the ones we found, not the ones we desired. And although we have a very large ""bank account"" that closely approximates wealth by level -- we have no time to actually do anything with it.

So I led a mutiny of sorts. I said we needed to stop and ""re-spec"" -- I'm a Monk with a magic dagger I mostly don't need and a pair of +1 bracers -- we have ""tanks"" with armour that is neither magical nor masterwork. 

If this was a homebrew campaign things wouldn't have mattered so much. But it isn't. We're running an Adventure Path, the GM has been tossing things at us pretty much as printed (his assurances, not my knowledge). So he had us roll some Knowledge Local rolls versus DC 20. We had one success (the Bard -- who basically succeeds on Knowledge skills). So the GM ""graciously"" offered to allow us to get one item created. 

I really do feel bad for what followed. Most of us have about 20,000gp ""sitting somewhere"". So after a quick silent conference with the other players, I put forth an ultimatum. Let us spend our loot, because we're not moving from ""Big City"" until we do. 

The GM was pretty upset, and much in the way of punitive measures -- up to and including ""skipping the fourth book and tossing you right into the fifth book"" came up.

My counter was that each and every encounter in the third book was wiping us out. We had more trips to negative hit-points than trips to the bathroom. most of the tough fights saw two, if not three of us laying prone, stabilized, waiting for post-fight healing. The Monk (me) is the only character with the ability to reliably strike past the damage resistance that has become ubiquitous. we were under-geared, thus out of our league. And our original mission from the first book was well and truly dispatched -- maybe it was time some other adventurers stepped forward and  saved the damn world, because we weren't going to cut it.

We hashed it out for about an hour. For the most part we stayed pretty calm, we had an adult beverage break, headed out to the balcony where those who inhale burning leaves could indulge. And the GM caved.

However, after most of us spent 16k-18k on magical gear (over multiple items) and were brought up somewhere close to wealth-by-level the GM blanched a little. ACs went up a fair bit. To hit and damage bonuses increased a fair chunk as well -- mine went up +3/+3, as I improved my +1 bracers to Bracers of Brawling (with a +2 bonus on unarmed strikes) and picked up a Belt of Strength --- both of those costing a total of 9,000gp.

It is pretty clear, in follow-up conversations, that the GM is sure that he made a mistake. In his mind the sharp increase in our abilities is akin to giving 1st level characters quivers full of magical swords and lockers full of magical armour, and going completely Monty Haul. He's discussed ""ret-conning"" the last session with me, and is pretty upset that the group ""mutinied"" and that I (an old and dear friend) was the ring-leader for said mutiny. And that makes me feel bad -- after all, I don't want to bully my friends. I'd just like our group to have a fair chance at success.

I think I've got him calmed down, we'll see for the next session. And who knows, maybe he will skip the fourth book, as we did take a lot of time to craft those items, and toss us in over our heads into the fifth book.

On the other hand, wealth-by-level is a part of Pathfinder. Totally possible to do without it in a home-brewed campaign, but all of the published sources have it figured into their CR formulas.

1376431460.0,35,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1kb3hx,The world's greatest familiar: WAR-GOAT!!!,F0LEY,43,8,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1kb3hx/the_worlds_greatest_familiar_wargoat/,"WAR-GOAT.

Fighter (Rough Rider)8 - Witch 1
Race: Gnome

stats: 

Str: 12 

Dex: 9

Con: 19

Int: 13

Wis: 7

Cha:13


(4th level stat increase was to con, 8th level stat increase was to Str)

At a later level the Fighter takes ONE level of witch, and picks a goat as his familiar (+3 to survival... whatever), However this is where things get FUN.

He casts enlarge person on his goat familiar (Normally would not effect a goat, but since it's his familiar: It does), then pays a wizard 2950gp to cast permanency on the enlarge person spell. He now has a Medium goat familiar.

The fighter has 5 bonus fighter feats, and 5 normal feats to pick from. Now the fighter bonus feats I'll get to in a second... but this isn't a post about the fighter: This is a post about the war-goat! So let's take those 5 feats and spend them on the War-goat (His int is 6, so he is NOT limited to monster feats):

evolved familiar: Combat Mount (War-Goat is now his fearless mount)

Familiar Feat: Improved Natural Attack (Takes the enlarged goats 1d6+3 gore to 1d8+3)

evolved familiar: Improved Damage(Takes the improved gore from 1d8+3 to 2d6+3)

evolved familiar: Reach (his horns now have a 10 foot reach)

Power Attack: Since familiars use their master's BAB... This is gonna get fun!

The thing to keep in mind is that a familiar uses his Master's base attack bonus and hit dice (His hp are always half of the master's rounded down). So since our rough rider/witch has about 96 HP, this means War Goat has 48 HP (and gains 5 or 6 HP a level) and a BAB of +8 (and his BAB is going up by fighter progression). Furthermore, as the mount of a rough rider AND a familiar he gets Improved Evasion, +3 to his AC and +2 to his saves (This will go to +4, +3 at 11th, and continue increasing every 4 levels). Him and the rider ALSO each get a +1 to attack and damage whenever the rider is mounted on War-Goat (This will increase to +2 at 10th, and every 4 levels after). Throw War-Goat an amulet of Mighty Fists, medium barding (Full plate at 12th level) and you have the world's most bad-ass familiar ever! 

(At 9th level with no magic or regular equipment, he can power attack from 10 feet away (With a +8 to hit) and do 2d6+13 ) 

...Just as an aside, the rider will take mounted combat, Ride-by attack, Spirited charge, Weapon focus (lance), and weapon specialization (lance). So he's gonna be pretty awesome as well, but really: Keep the focus on the mighty War-Goat!",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_1kb3hx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1kb3hx/the_worlds_greatest_familiar_wargoat/,

So far I've included five different types of generation, but more can be pretty easily added as the needs arise.

All areas use Ultimate Equipment for the various available treasures. Otherwise...

-------------------

**City Treasure**: Uses the Core Rulebook/Gamemastery Guide rules for what magic items are available in the various sized communities.

**Encounter Treasure**: Uses the Ultimate Equipment's various ""Type"" tables for generating appropriate treasure based on CR.

**Kingdom Treasure**: For Kingmaker, produces a number of Minor/Medium/Major items, using the Core Rulebook's percentages for types.

**Treasure by Type**: Input the exact quantity of each item you want, and out it comes.

**Treasure by Value**: Input a GP budget for each area (Minor/Medium/Major) and get some random items. Uses the Core Rulebook's percentages for types.

------------------

As a plus, the value of everything is displayed with the item, along with other miscellaneous information (does the weapon glow?). I am still missing a few other bits that could go in, which I would like to address later. There is a percentage chance that a weapon/armor could be made of a special material, which right now doesn't happen (with the exception of specific items in the Specific Weapon/Armor tables, like mithril shirt). Additionally, while the tool will let you know if an item should be Intelligent, it won't do any other leg work. I couldn't find a decent table to fully generate an Intelligent item (the ones in the Core book and UE do have some random tables, but not for everything, like statistics). Of course, I may have just been blind and missed some obvious bits for it. In any event, that part will be in later.

Otherwise, all items/spells/etc. should be fully hyperlinked to their respective entries in the Archives. If something isn't linking properly or otherwise broken, please let me know! This is definitely one of the larger projects I've worked on, and while I have done a lot of testing there is always something one person can miss.

1363863515.0,34,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1aq53m,"Am I Satan? (Don't worry, not RL religion)",AtomicGamer,42,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1aq53m/am_i_satan_dont_worry_not_rl_religion/,"This is a low powered game (at first), which was limited to level one for the longest time due to an ingame artifact (since destroyed)

In this game, my CG character died, helping the dwarves fight off a hag that was plaguing them. Her LE sorcerer friend had a storytelling/RP ability to summon a contract devil that might do a lot of stuff, in exchange for a soul.

He summoned the devil on her behalf while she was dying (from a hag's curse) and he offered to save her in exchange for her soul once she died.

The problem is that because this is a fallen world with almost no schools, high level characters or deities, nobody really knows what a soul is. (and we consistently fail all our religion/planes checks to find any information on the subject) OR what a devil is (or angel or anything really)

The contract did spell out that she would belong to him in perpetuity, and so she declined on general (chaotic) principle, and then failed her save and died.

While she's dead, her friends continue, break the curse on the world, open the ancient city of the dwarves, find all sorts of neat stuff.

While this is happening, the sorcerer is talking to the devil, who explains to him that the more souls he gathers, particularly from powerful good individuals, but anyone really, the more power he'll have.

He convinces the dwarven queen to give up her soul to speak to her dead husband (a former party member who also died) one last time, and then, while the rest of the group is busy (we were manipulated into being busy, by him) he convinces her that the devils he is in contact with are actually gods, to be worshipped. (he's got a crazy diplomacy score)

While we are away, the queen has all her dwarves sign a contract of his design (both the sorcerer and the GM are pre-law students), that basically signs over all the 300+ dwarven souls to the devils, with the sorcerer acting as intermediary, their voice on earth and prophet. The contract basically forms a new religion, spelling out the 'Lawful Evil' precepts of the faith. (which is a harsh, medieval sort of 'non-believers can be tolerated as guests, but every effort should be made to convert them to the faith and sign the contract' religion)

So when we return, all the dwarves are bowing to the sorcerer, calling him prophet, and the queen is eating out of his hand (non literally, but you know)

At about the same time this is all happening, my bard had an adventure in Elysium, which ended with her bonding with an angel, acquiring the half-celestial template and retraining her bard levels into levels of a CG paladin variant (Paladin of Freedom) that is basically in all mechanical aspects the same as a paladin.

She returns to the city, on actual silvery wings to rejoin her friends just as the whole thing is going down. (the half celestial idea was my GMs, as was bringing her back, I didn't actually push for it at all). She's a renegade from heaven and probably shouldn't come too close to any angelic types.

She doesn't really 'know' what devils are either, but she knows nobody in Elysium spoke of any 'gods' and she got a definite 'evil' reading from both a ring that the sorcerer gave the queen, as well as the room in which the sorcerer summoned and spoke to the devils. (the sorcerer isn't high level enough to register as evil by himself). She also found the contract remarkably explicit and precise on the requirements of the subjects (the dwarves) and everything the gods (the devils) promised in return was vague and open to interpretation, so naturally, she tried to convince everyone to not sign. (the dwarves all had, but at this point, the sorcerer was pushing for the party to sign also)

To complicate this, she and the sorcerer are childhood friends.

Hardly anyone really listened to her, and at least one of the remaining party members signed (LN cleric, though she's probably trying to see if she can do more good by infiltrating the religion) and another got a 'special deal' for himself.

Anyway, it occurs to me that, if this religion comes to be a major thing in the next hundreds or thousands of years, what role is the Fallen angel who tried to tempt people away from the Gods and spoke against their will likely to have in the mythology?

Anyway, I've decided to try to make this playable, the world is a greyscale morality and now that my character has tried and failed to persuade people against this, she's mostly going to try to watch over her friends and keep them safe, while waiting for her Ray Patterson moment. 

(The sanitation Commissioner from the Simpsons, who Homer replaced, and after Homer had screwed up and filled the city with garbage and the people wanted to reinstate Ray, he got up on stage and said: ""I ain't much on speeches, but I can't tell you how gratifying it is to leave you wallowing in the mess you've made, you're screwed, bye!"")

Looking for motivation / advice.",Ashmai,44,8,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1i7ho8/families_first_night_with_pathfinder_wife_son_and/,"This may be a long one, but I have no one else that gives a shit about table top gaming and I'm really looking to make this a successful past time for my wife and kids.

We haven't played a table top RPG (D&amp;D, Pathfinder, etc) ever. I have always loved fantasy, play a lot of video games, and read a review about how amazing Pathfinder was so picked up my Beginners Box from Amazon, and started reading. I put roughly 15 hours into reading, forums, the Black Fang starter dungeon research, DL'ed apps to help keep track of modifiers, got everyone pencils, printed character sheets, etc. Thought I understood the basic principles and wanted to heavily rely on the books advice of ""have fun first, research rules later"". Figured if something came up I wasn't sure on I would make a call as DM, move along, and research later. I also encouraged my son and wife to be creative. Don't just walk into a room, charge an enemy, and swing with your weapon. Look over your skills, decide how to help each other, try to put the enemy between you and your ally as to gain Flanking, etc.

My first mistake (perhaps) was not using the pre-built characters that came with the Beginners Box. Since the app I downloaded (Hero Lab) wouldn't let a Beginner's Box character be in the same portfolio as a normal Pathfinders character, I made both characters ""normal"" since my wife wanted to play a Druid really bad (wasn't included in Beginners Box). This added a ton of complexity to my characters, stuff I really had no clue what it was. But I figured I would just use what I need and grow into the rest.

The very first area we are in, outside a cave thinking about going into the first ""encounter"" area, my wife starts asking questions like ""I want my frog to walk up on the wall because it has a 6+ to climb, go slowly into the room and look for enemies and report back... Of course the Beginners Box simply says something to the affect of ""After the players all take a round, goblins burst through the curtain and attack"". So 30 seconds into our game, I don't know WTF to do. Pulling something straight out of my ass like a magician, I say ""your frog companion can't speak / communicate with you, so wouldn't be able to tell you what was in there in the first place"" and we move on avoiding disaster.

This was the start of a string of ""what if's"" I could barely keep up with. ""In one round can I drop my bow, and sheathe my sword, move and attack? or does that take two rounds?"". ""My frogs attacks show he can attack with ""Single Melee 1d20+3, but that seems like a shit ton of dmg for a level 1 frog considering we are all hitting for like 1d6'ish"". ""Can I use Spellcraft the same as detect magic to identify this magical gem?"" ""What is ""melee touch and ranged touch"" that's listed here under my weapon name mean""? ""I use produce flame to shoot a fireball at the goblin. However the description I found on d20pfsrd.com was so fucking confusing I have really no clue how the spell works whatsoever. ""My frog uses Pull with his tongue, does that do damage? And does it pull the enemy to me or leave him 3 squares away?"" ""WTF is critical threat, is that the same as critical hit adding 2x dmg to your dmg roll?"" ""Can my frog put on this ring?"".

Fuck, it was a constant waterfall of questions well outside most of the Beginners Box that left me tired, sweaty, and stressed. I jotted down my questions (listed above) and said I would look into it after our session, and well, here I am... I have PDF's for nearly all rules, advanced, beginner, websites, guides, forums.... and I still find that being brand new to this game may be more than I can handle. I fly airplanes, engineer IT solutions, and speak multiple languages, but D&amp;D seems to prove much more difficult than all these other things in my life by FAR.

In 4 1/2 hours we were able to get 3 rooms into the beginners box adventure. My wife had 2 shots of vodka and a Mojito, however I was to afraid to drink with that much research and attention needed devoted to running this world.

Could anyone clarify those rules above, and perhaps offer me any advice? When I could make quick calls on the fly, I did, and I just took notes to look up answers later. However some things I don't even know WHAT to look up... So I almost have to tell them to do something else, which takes away from their fun. I must be over analyzing this, and putting to much thought into our first session of table top gaming ever, but 15 hours of research prior to game play, to make it (barely) through 3 rooms seemed so extremely time consuming.

On a closing note, when we were fighting, solving puzzles, and hacking goblin's heads off, we were having an absolute BLAST. I haven't seen my son smile like that in a long time, and even my wife admitted when I wasn't staring at 3 PDF's, a forum, and 2 manuals for 30 minutes at a time, she was having fun as well. I really want to stick with this and be successful but am feeling maybe we aren't cut out for it.

Bonus for reading until the end, here is a shot of our first attempt at turning our table into a dungeon :)

1364928735.0,36,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1bj6hc,Planning an Evil campaign that seeks to go beyond the typical childish view of Evil,AngryCyc,44,8,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1bj6hc/planning_an_evil_campaign_that_seeks_to_go_beyond/,"I'm starting to plan a campaign right now that won't even take place until fall, because that's how much prep time I want to get this thing perfect. The basic concept is pre-made characters that my players will have to choose from. There will be about 20 pre-made characters, each made up to the 5th level, and then the players will make the 6th level themselves and start with 6th level characters.

The interesting thing will be the players don't get to know everything about the characters before they choose them. Only very basic or general information will be given. This is partially to keep the players in the dark about what they are choosing before they choose it, but it is most importantly so that the OTHER players don't know what each specific person has chosen as their player.

You see, though the PC's will be united together under one banner and in a party that works for eachother, each character will have its own evil end-goal. The players might not necessarily be working against each other, but each one will be trying to complete their end goal, and I doubt very much that they'd want everyone else to know something like ""I want to obliterate the sun and plunge the world into darkness"" or ""I want to corrupt the 5 major religions and have them turn all worship over to _____.""

Furhtermore, the characters will be at varying powerscales relative to eachother. My players are fully aware of this going in and are okay with the fact that they might not be equal. But for an example, one of the characters might be Gestalt up to 5th level. Another might secretly be a vampire, or have some other template applied to it. This information won't be available to the players when they're deciding what character they want to play. Instead, they'll get info like ""This character will tend towards melee combat, but will also be very good at social abilities"" or ""This character will kind of suck at any challenge, but will be a bit crazy and I guarantee you'll have fun with it"" with the point being to let them have a generally vague idea of what they're getting into. Once they get the character, though, they get all knowledge of it.

FURTHER furthermore, different characters will be built to different levels of completeness. One character might have literally everything made except skill points, another might have only 1 or 2 levels made and the player gets to pick everything else up to 6th level. One character might have an entire backstory already made, another character might have almost no backstory but some loose associations with other characters. Oh that reminds me! Whatever characters the players don't select will still be around, doing exactly what they would want to do had they been chosen as PC's.

Okay, now that I've got the basic concept out of the way, here's why I'm posting: I'm looking for cool concepts of evil beyond ""I rape and kill and steal a lot because it's fun."" I'm looking for the kind of evil that will make my players genuinely get behind their character's motivations and say, ""hey, yeah! This isn't really such a bad thing to do... I mean he's not REALLY that bad!"" until a bit down the road, they realize they've made the starting of Hitler and the Holocaust, or racism, or whatever.

SO. With literally anything on the table, what kind of character would you make for this campaign to make available for my players? The most important thing will be the character's evil end-goals, as that is what they'll spend the whole campaign working towards. So what are some truly evil things you can imagine that are actually playable? Or, what are some really interesting mash-ups of a character's basic build that works well with an end-goal? For instance, the vampire who wants to obliterate the sun... The necromancer who wants to bring back his dead wife from Hell at any cost... The young revolutionary who starts Communism and then becomes the dictator of it.

What would YOU have the most fun with if you were just handed a character, little bit of a backstory, and general end-goal?",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_1bj6hc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1bj6hc/planning_an_evil_campaign_that_seeks_to_go_beyond/,

But the most OP things about it is the fact that you can use it to deliver touch spells.

My witch, Yssma, is the unofficial healer in the group and I use this hex all day to spam my cure light wounds hex. It allows me to heal my teammates in battle while staying nice and far away from harm. I actually have a trained pet falcon, Cojack, that spends a lot of time in my beehive hairdo. At will, I can release Cojack to attack. Another things I've done is walk besides an NPC nochalantly while my hair pickpocketed him. I've delivered touch spells from a safe (and concealed) distance, and made a bull-rush using it while my party members blocked my path. I've used it to enhance an intimidate check by growing it long and waving it about.

For class, I chose Fighter in order to get as many feats as possible. I also take the Archer archetype in order to effectively get Point-Blank Master as a class feature at level 9.

Human is the ideal race choice as well, for the extra feat at level 1.

Initially, the primary tactic of the archer will be to use readied actions to fire on casters at any point in which they attempt to cast a spell, since he cannot make attacks of opportunity with a ranged weapon; this still forces a caster to make a concentration check to avoid losing the spell when damaged ([10 + damage dealt + spell level](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration)). Things start to shake up at level 6, though, as I'll explain below.

Level breakdown is as follows:

**Level 1**

* *Human Feat* Point-Blank Shot
* *Level 1 Feat* Precise Shot
* *Fighter Feat* Weapon Focus (longbow)

**Level 2**

* *Fighter Feat* Rapid Shot

**Level 3**

* *Level 3 Feat* Dodge
* *Trick Shot* Disarm; useful for knocking those pesky wands/rods/staves out of casters' hands, among other things.

**Level 4**

* *Fighter Feat* Mobility
* *+1 Dexterity*

**Level 5**

* *Level 5 Feat* Combat Reflexes

**Level 6**

* *Fighter Feat* Snap Shot; At this point, the archer can now threaten 5 ft. squares, and does not provoke if he takes an AoO with his longbow. Moreover, thanks to taking Combat Reflexes at the previous level, he can do this multiple times in a round.

**Level 7**

* *Level 7 Feat* Disruptive; The DC for casting defensively within 5ft. of the archer is now increased by +4.
* *Trick Shot* Feint

**Level 8**

* *Fighter Feat* Combat Patrol; With this feat, the archer can take a full-round action to increase the area he threatens by 5 ft.; anyone moving, casting a spell, firing a ranged weapon, etc within 10 ft. of him provokes an AoO when he takes this action, and the archer doesn't have to move to make the attack.
* *+1 Dexterity*

**Level 9**

* *Level 9 Feat* Improved Snap Shot; The archer now passively threatens an area of 15 ft. around him, and 20 ft. when taking the Combat Patrol full-round action.
* *Safe Shot* The archer can now fire indiscriminately without worrying about provoking attacks at all.

**Level 10**

* *Fighter Feat* Spellbreaker; If a caster fails his defensive casting check within 15 ft. of the archer, he can make an attack of opportunity against him. If the archer has taken the Combat Patrol full-round action, this range is 25 ft.

**Level 11**

* *Level 11 Feat* Disrupting Shot; The check to avoid losing a spell on damage is now increased by +4 if the damage was a result of the archer readying an action.
* *Trick Shot* Grapple; If a caster is successfully grappled by an arrow, he must make concentration checks to cast a spell; it probably won't be too effective, but it's yet another attack option.

**Level 12**

* *Fighter Feat* Greater Snap Shot
* *+1 Dexterity*

**Level 13**

* *Level 13 Feat* Pin Down; Any opponent within 15/25 ft. now provokes on withdraw or 5 ft. step, and the move action that allowed the 5 ft step is preempted.

**Level 14**

* *Fighter Feat* Teleport Tactician; anyone teleporting within 15/25 ft. of the archer now provokes.

**Level 15**

* *Level 15 Feat* Vital Strike; Vital Strike is a standard action, so it can be readied in response to a caster casting a spell, significantly improving the chances that the spell will be lost.
* Combat Patrol improves to +15 ft., so the archer now threatens 30 ft. on a full-round action, and 15 ft. passively.
* *Trick Shot* Sunder or Bull Rush; I don't know which would be better.

I'm not sure what to pick yet for levels 16+, though I will point out that upon level 20, the archer will be capable of threatening 35 ft. around him when taking a full-round action.



When played as I envision (readying actions to fire at casters, using full round actions to threaten the battleground as much as possible), I don't expect that the raw damage output would be very high. Of course, if starting with an 18 Dexterity, by level 20 the archer will be able to take up to 6 AoOs per round, and that can probably add up pretty fast.

I've been so busy with work that I didn't really have anything prepared for the players. I like to do a huge amount of prep, so it's unusual that I decided to wing it.

Halfway through the night, I decide the final encounter will be a non-combat encounter. I come up with something really devious.

As the PCs go to request some information from an undead queen, she says that she will agree to assist them if they provide her with entertainment. The guys are all making jokes about it, like guys do. But then the queen says that the price will be to pull a card from the Deck of Many Things. 

As I pull out a deck of 22 playing cards, the two experienced players at my table both curse. The newbies obviously don't know what's up, so I introduce the Deck in character. One of the old salts throws himself on the grenade and agrees to draw one card. It's the Talons card. Which doesn't do anything since he didn't have any magic items on hand.

This is where it gets fun. The entire table decides that they want to draw cards. The newbies each try to outdo each other. One guy draws two cards, another three and the last FIVE. One guy lost all his equipment to the Ruin card. Another gets the Gem card and an insane amount of wealth. One got a wish and used it for the ""Best rogue gear in the world!"" (Hairpin. The best rogue in the world doesn't need very good gear.)

Then the guy who agreed to pull 5. He gets four awesome cards, and I'm hoping to drop a karma bomb on him for his hubris. The last card? The Fool. Draw more cards. After that? The Skull. 

The Skull summons a Dread Wraith that (probably) slays the card drawer. Anyone assisting him? They get to fight one, too. Pow! Right in the kisser. He died, and everybody loved the session.

It's basically a triangle, with ""I am X"" on one side, and ""You are X"" + relevant rules/modifiers on the other.  This allows the GM to scan the table for who is under what status effect, and allows players to quickly reference said rules/modifiers.

1365138853.0,32,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1bpsez,"""That provokes, right?"" A story of Tieflings and Tracheotomies (xpost from gametales)",Jolom,42,10,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1bpsez/that_provokes_right_a_story_of_tieflings_and/,"So I was playing Pathfinder with my best friend as DM, and two guys we met off Reddit. Our party was made up of a Halfling Rouge (played by me), a Human Fighter who wore an armored trench coat, and a Human Cleric who wanted to sex everything.

We were early in our campaign, still level one, and were tasked with finding the King's kidnapped daughter, which we accidentally succeeded in doing. We found her bound and gagged inside a cave surrounded by four Tiefling Rouges, and battle was soon joined. Thanks to some quick thinking, and a few lucky rolls, we quickly dispatched three of the four Tieflings, and we had the last one surrounded. Now here is where the magic started:

DM: ""The Tiefling realizes he is screwed, and Coup de grâces himself with his knife. As you three start to walk towards the princess...""

Cleric: ""Wait, why did he kill himself?""

DM: ""He saw what you did to his friends, and decided to take the easy way out. Anyways...""

Fighter: ""Ah man, I wanted a prisoner...""

Me: ""...Does a Coup de grâce provoke? That provokes, right?""

Laughter around the table.

""No, seriously, I think it does! I attack him!""

DM: ""Wat. Why?""

Me: ""Non-lethal, I want to knock him out!""

DM: ""Ok, sure, but you are at a -4 to hit, so I really doubt...""

clack clack clack

Natural 20.

DM: ""God, I hate you. Ok, confirm.""

I roll again, not so well this time, 15 total, with the Tiefling having 14 AC, as we had learned earlier.

DM: Darn, you only do normal damage. That suc-""

Fighter: ""No no, he crit! We are flanking, so he only took a -2!""

DM: ""That still gives him 13, 1 short. Like I said, that-""

Fighter: ""Bless."" The DM had apparently forgotten the Bless spell cast at the beginning of the fight, which was still very much active.

DM: ""Fine, whatever! You crit, but the Tiefling wasn't hurt, so I doubt-""

Me: ""8. Max damage, doubled, so 16."" 16 was the exact HP of the Tiefling.

DM: ""...I hate all of you.""

So we bound up the Tiefling with the ropes from the princess, and began to head back to the castle, when the DM decided he had not given up. Yet.

DM: ""Alright, since you guys don't have a guide, you will have to roll Survival to see if you can make it back. But be careful, there are Tiefling-eating bears in these woods...""

clack clack clack

Natural 20 from the Fighter.(We had a home-rule that a natural 20 meant automatic success on skill checks, to keep things hilarious and interesting.)

The DM was silent for a second, and then sighed. ""You find your way back perfectly, and avoid all the bears. However..."" The DM started to perk up.

Me: ""I check the Tieflings mouth.""

DM: ""What? Why?""

Me: ""The tiefling just bit his own tongue off so we can't take him alive, didn't he?""

The DM was silent. That was in fact exactly what had just happened.

After a quick healing from our Cleric (We decided that we shoved the tongue back in the mouth and healed the wound) the party realized we had a few options here: We could either make a contraption of a gag so that the Tiefling couldn't bite his tongue but could still breathe; we could have the cleric walk behind him constantly casting Cure Minor Wounds (in Pathfinder level 0 spells can be cast as often as you like) so he couldn't bite through his tongue again, or...

Cleric: ""We are next to a river, right?""

DM: ""Yeah, and?""

Cleric: ""Are there reeds growing there?""

DM: Yeah, sure. Why?""

Cleric: We could preform a tracheotomy! That way, he can't suffocate himself!""

The DM was aghast, and utterly refused to let us try it. We ended up going with a combination of plan A and B, and got our prisoner back to the King for interrogation.

And thus ended the one and only story of competency that our group had.

After careful thought I decided I couldn't simply not mention anything or kick him out without a warning. Part of me wants to. He does make things difficult for me. At the same time a ""rule-lawyer"" can be a boon if they can offer rule assistance in a helpful way. Additionally... I think it just is a dick move to kick someone out of a group without a polite conversation.

With this in mind I crafted this message:
&gt;
Hey. Yeah we plan on starting up again this Saturday at 1pm. Before we get you started though there are two things you should know.
&gt;
1) After last session most of the people came to me to tell me they were unhappy about the last session. They felt you monopolized the majority of the time. Which is true. This is a team game that deals with social interaction and thus you shouldn't of allowed yourself to monopolize DM time to your character so much.
&gt;
This is not to say that I am without fault. I let you play a creature I wasn't comfortable with (my mistake). I let you monopolize my time when you only constituted 1/5 of the total player amount (my mistake). In retrospect I should of give you 3 rounds of action in which I gave obvious signs of doom approaching and then simply killed your character. It simply wasn't fair to rest of the party.
&gt;
2) Rules mania. Another part that makes the game less enjoyable is the adherence to the rules. I've read the book front to cover, but yes, I don't know the rules as well as you, though I try. It makes the game less enjoyable for all when I get bogged down looking up rules since you seem to want to challenge my ruling every other turn.
&gt;
Just a few things to point out about this. I personally prefer to follow the rules, if I believe they make sense. I am not perfect. But when you point them out it, or when you think I am wrong, have a page number to turn to. Don't bog the game down in an endless cycle of rule look up. In fact I feel the best way to handle such a case would be to simply do something else for your turn and then look it up in the book. Then simply hand me the book, pointing out where the ruling is. This takes less time away from others while still helping me out with the rules.
&gt;
The second point to make about rules is that the GM/DM is the final arbiter of the rules and may throw anything out. I know you are aware of this. I also don't wish to make the rules so arbitrary that the rule books have no meaning. I also have no problem simply not using a rule that makes zero sense to me(though this happens rarely). And I also don't mind waving a rule aside for something that might be fun for a player. The point I want to make is that the rules are not supreme. It is okay to relax on them a bit. I still would like your help (in the method I mentioned) on the rules but I simply will not be stopping play every turn anymore.
&gt;
To end this... I know this sounds like an attack of some sort so I am going to explicitly say that I am NOT trying to attack you. My job as DM is try to make it so everyone can have fun, which last session did not happen. I would be more than happy to have you play again but I am simply writing this to ask you to bring your play style more in line with everyone else such that the next game will be fun for everyone.
&gt;
I understand if you feel ""picked on"" to some aspect or if you simply don't like the way I DM to the point you would rather not play than change your style of play slightly. If you do still want to play, please let me know as soon as possible so I can adjust the campaign I've created to account for your characters (IE increase the difficulty).
&gt;
-Robert



After about a day I got a response:
&gt;
i understand a lot of what you said.
i was also frustrated with how last session turned out, zero progress, no party members, and literally(or is it figurative if in game?) banging my head ageist a stone wall.
long-term separation of a single party member just isn't practical play.
i thought about this awhile, and although it might be meta-gaming, might i suggest that party members just conveniently meet after so much being lost?
But anyway, i am still interested in playing again.
i've said this before, but if i get too ""rule lawyery"" just let me know and i can zip it.
i am bad at doing that in most games, but doing it in this one means conversations like this happens.
&gt;

At this juncture I think I am fine with teh current turn of events. If a game bombs again because of him I can say I at least tried. If he shapes up he can become helpful to me as a GM.

Here is a place to post your own overpowered items that you've found from the various books. I'll start with a few of my own.

1. Quick Runner's Shirt (Ultimate Equipment). For 1000gp, you can spend a swift action to move your speed in combat once per day. This lets you do stuff like move and full attack on the first round of combat. In a pathfinder society game, we had 8 of these shirts, at a table of 5 people. Edit: Paizo's Pathfinder Society Organizer has said that this item is going to be all-out-banned for organized play.

2. Bracers of Falcon's Aim (Ultimate Equipment). For 4000gp, these bracers give +1 to ranged attacks, and keen (19-20 crit) on all bows and keen (18-20crit) on crossbows. And a +3 to perception checks. For reference, Bracers of Archery are 5000gp, and only give +1 to ranged attacks and proficiency in all bows (which you will have already if you bother to buy them).

3. Jingasa of the Fortunate Soldier (Ultimate Equipment, again, see a theme?). For 5000gp, this helm gives you +1 luck bonus to AC, and the ability to once-per-day negate a critical hit or sneak attack. For reference, an ioun stone of +1 insight to AC is the same 5000gp, and is easy to sunder and get damaged. Flat out better than the alternative.

This I plan to put at as a topic on each of my Pathfinder campaigns to clarify how I think. Since you joined the game in the first place it is not required reading but I find it interesting as an explanation to keep me and the players on the same page. 

Here I want to explain why I'm using Pathfinder almost exclusively in list form. The list is not in a particular order as I write this. I write each subject as it comes to me. 



**1)Pathfinder is Popular**


Not to say that I am one to just go with the flow and stick with the mainstream, because if you know me I'm not. But Pathfinder's popularity comes with several advantages, especially since it is mostly an iteration of the previously popular Dungeons and Dragons 3.5 edition. It's more likely that players know how to play. It's very easy to find materials that support it, even if the materials were not built for Pathfinder specifically. There is a significant amount of digital resources that support Pathfinder. There are also fewer things you have to teach, in that even if its just basic information people already have concepts of things like wizards, rogues and elves. Even if your only experience in roleplaying is Final Fantasy, you still know that with too little HP you die. 


**2) Pathfinder is Crunchy**


What I mean by 'crunchy' is that it has a ton of rules. Now this is the point where a lot of people would disagree favoring games that are far less complicated. At that I would say that there isn't a wrong answer for the complex vs rules light debate. 


But there are particular reasons why I mostly use a crunchy system like Pathfinder, the first one being that players know what to expect. One thing about rules is that most people assume they are there to regulate players and what they can do but they also regulate DMs. Even though the DM or GM is the final arbiter of how the campaign world works and how things the players do functions but with a lot of rules like Pathfinder the player does not have to do any kind of guesswork to figure out what he or she can do and whether or not it will work the way they expect even if there are alternative rulings by the DM. For a DM the rules make things way easier to re-use a campaign with new players or play with a pre-generated scenario or campaign because it is easier to anticipate what the players can do at each power level and oddly enough makes it easy to predict how to do things on the fly without them seeming out of place or overpowered. 


**3) Pathfinder is Complicated**


This seems like a reiteration of my previous point and an argument against the system in general with but hear me out. I play Magic the Gathering, a game where there are thousands of components and options used to generate single decks that may or may not work. A lot can be said about a deck's 'personality' whether it triumphs or fails, especially in casual play. It can say a lot about how a player thinks, how they like to play, what options they choose and what strategies they value. I see a lot of similarities and the same kind of fun in roleplaying games with a lot of options like Pathfinder. This does have the inherent flaw that it is very easy to make an ineffective character much like how you can make a failing deck, but on the other side of the coin you a character has a very personal flavor to it. You can make a character that is an insanely goofy build or you could min-max for efficiency. Some see this as making character building a chore while I see it as artistically crafting your character. A rules light system does give you the same if not more freedom to make the character you want but I feel like the restrictions involved in the rules gives a bit of challenge that really makes he character your build giving character creation a more 'game-like' aspect as opposed to a 'toy-like' aspect.


**4)Pathfinder is Diverse.**

 

Looking at Paizo's Golarion setting it's easy to see that they wanted to fit in a little bit of everything. The hardcover books imply this as well; Pathfinder is a game that's easy to homebrew because you can do virtually anything you want within the realm of high fantasy. It's easy to see where to cut classes or feats to mold the game more to your setting and it's easy to get third party material to get the game to do what you want. I've played a lot of indie RPGs that were too setting specific for my tastes and while any system can be tweaked a lot of Pathfinder rules supports what I want to do without limiting too many options for the players. Not only that, when it comes to new players they don't need to get used to a new system or new game just to play a different kind of game unless we're playing a completely different genre. I've done political intrigue, horror, and even fantasy science fiction in Pathfinder, sometimes even in the same setting. 


**5)Pathfinder is Free**



I have a copy of each of the hard copy core books with the exception of Bestiary 2 and 3. I've bought Pathfinder Minis and playmats. I have not spent more on a single game and each new material is incredibly useful. But the fact that the rules are free online is incredibly useful for players who don't have all that stuff, especially in between sessions, and would not be the same game without the online resources. I could conceivably play Pathfinder with no books, and I've been thankful for the times I had access to the books before I was able to buy the books.",,False,self,t5_2trms,1366069934.0,,,True,t3_1cf0dj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1cf0dj/why_pathfinder/,

He died in the slaughter of his entire war-party and... returned to life as an oracle!  (Wasting Curse)

Mechanically, I've had this character as a Cleric initially, but I struggle with the prepared spell system so the DM let me remake him as an Oracle.  Very little actually changed (still use a greatsword, still have diehard, although now by a revelation, still roll multiple times for initiative [tactics subdomain vs War Sight.)  For the next five sessions, I get to tinker with him until I come up with something that fits.

Tuntus' goal is to get into Gorum's afterlife.  (Initially the flavor was he thought he was already dead, but that ran into too much trouble.  This is more actionable, and more fun/less cartoony.)  It is an afterlife of constant battle, food, and drink, like Valhalla but with more Orcs.  MY goal is to get him as close to death as possible with each (serious) fight such that his name changes.  (At the DM's discretion.)  TUNTUS wants to die in battle.  I THE PLAYER want him not to die.  

In the last session (his debut as an Oracle) he got down to EXACTLY his con score below 0.  I spent a Hero point and a teammate did as well to instead have him at just 1 above dead and stable (cheat death hero point ability.)  At that point the DM stated my name changed, so he's now four times dead and... frustrated.  Returning from the dead makes his scarring far worse, but that doesn't bother him.

SO on to the mechanical crux of why I'm posting this.  I have the Furious Focus feat.  I didn't use it once during the last session as I forgot I had it.  I figure if it's that forgettable and I'm still hitting I can skip it for something neater.  I'd like a flavorful feat to take its place.  The two I'm looking at are [Tenacious Surivor](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/arg-feats/tenacious-survivor-orc-half-orc) and [Deathless Initiate](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deathless-initiate-combat).  I may take both eventually.  If anyone has any other suggestions for a Valhalla seeking Orc-le, I'd love to hear it.  I'm leaning towards Deathless Initiate, but I'm not sold one way or the other.  I could also just take Extra Revelation, but the game will go to 20th so I'm not worried about missing anything.

Relevant Modifiers:  STR +6, DEX +2, CON +5, CHA +6 (After enhancement bonuses.)

Current Feats:  Extra Rev, Power Attack, Craft Arms and Armor, [Furious Focus], Extra Rev, Extend Spell.  
Bonus Feats:  Improved and Greater Bull Rush, Diehard, Endurance [Alternate Race Trait], Weapon Focus and Improved Critical {Greatsword}

Revelations:  War Sight, Skill at Arms, Battlefield Clarity, Weapon Mastery {Greatsword}, Maneuver Mastery {Bull Rush}, Resiliency

Thanks for your advice

TL;DR/10 Cold Iron:  Tuntus wants to die in battle and I (his god) don't want him to.  I have a spare feat to throw at making him more badass as the moment of death approaches.  Advise at your leisure.

I wanted to post my thoughts on it, answer questions for would-be purchasers or ask thoughts on it by people who bought it already. 

Ch 1: Character Background

The first bit is explaining how to make a background for your character including different things to consider and detail when you're developing a backstory for yourself. Its really neat and explains the importance of things like family relationships, family, culture and vulnerabilities when making the events that make your character today. However that's not the meat of the chapter. The real useful things are the new traits, (including the old ones so you only have to look them up in one book) drawbacks, which grants you an additional trait, and Story feats. 

The traits are great and varied, giving you all kinds of things to represent your character. I noticed not much was added to race traits, probably because they are only focusing on the core races and they didn't want them to get too much power of variety when there is an advanced race guide out there. I also noticed a complete lack of campaign traits, probably due to them being too Golarion specific. 

The Drawbacks are fun. Obviously many of them suck but not enough to disable your character too much. 

The story feats are mostly 'meh' in power and awesome in flavor. I would seriously consider taking a story feat in place of two traits or making it an option for players. They are so interesting but I don't imagine too many people sacrificing feats in favor of a story feat. If I could take two traits and two drawbacks for a story feat I would. 

The most fun of the chapter is the Background Generator. You make different rolls to fill out your background and alignment. I spent a lot of time just rolling up characters and they more often than not come out very interesting. I even filled out missing background details for some of my current characters. The best part is that depending on how your background turns up it grants access or reccomends traits and story feats for you to take. I almost feel like this should be a requirement for the traits, as often players treat traits like more plusses to put on their character sheet without real regard for how it develops their character. 

Ch 2; Downtime

Chapter two is something I will likely never use. It gives you day jobs and establishments you own. Its interesting and satisfyingly complex but it somewhat feels like I'm playing business tycoon in between adventures. If your adventurers do want to own a bar or start a church or guild then it is invaluable. 

Ch 3; Campaign Systems

Many of these are hit or miss depending on what kind of game you're running but I guarantee that something is going to hit. It's basically optional rules for handling optional things like honor, fame, contacts, exploration and relationships. Many of these thing appear in adventure paths and are expanded upon making them really useful. Some of them have less rules and more fluff to consider. 

Ch 4; Kingdoms and War

Another thing I'll never use. While this chapter presents a deep system for mass combat and kingdom building, both of those activities, for me, turn Pathfinder from a heroic adventure game to playing Civilizations. The rules are almost like a new game itself, so much so that after reading the whole thing I'm tempted to run a campaign where we ditch the character sheets and just play a Pathfinder: Tactics, where instead of a party the players are an alliance of kingdoms. For playing a 'Civilizations V' campaign or Kingmaker type campaigns these rules are great, but they are not so useful for your typical murder-hobo. 

Overall I think this book is spectacular. I do have a few criticisms about whats NOT in it. 
Firstly we have a ton of new social systems and optional things to keep track of but none of the social systems have tracking sheets. Downtime, Kingdoms and Armies have sheets, but what I really wanted was a Contacts, Exploration or Relationship sheet. I know I can make one on my own but I wanted one made for me. 
Also speaking of Relationships I really wish there was more crunch in there involving relationship's interactions with Diplomacy, Bluff and Intimidate. As it stands I have to pile on a ton circumstance bonuses from several books to keep Diplomacy from getting too out of hand. having social skills revolve around relationships would have been a great shortcut to making Diplomacy easier to handle without making it worthless. Using relationship and contact rules you can easily Macguyver some house rules together but what I wanted was for the game to do it for me not halfway do it for me.

1366119800.0,30,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1cgkee,The art of haggling,Micp,36,6,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1cgkee/the_art_of_haggling/,"So lately it seems to me like this subreddit has mostly been about asking questions, so i thought i'd instead make a post giving help instead of asking for it.

Many people have forgotten the art of haggling, which is a damn shame. when trading a successful haggling can mean a price difference of 10-20% to your advantage, so besides just being good roleplaying it's actually a pretty significant powerboost, considering the extra gear you can buy for those 10-20%

First of all: don't just say ""i roll diplomacy to haggle"". DM's hate that and you won't get anywhere with it. As with all skill rolls based on talking: TALK. If you do well your GM might even give you a bonus to the roll.

What should you then say?

* Oversell yourself: The gear I have is clearly extraordinary, relics from a lost culture. Trust me, i should know, remember how i saved the town last week? the only reason i'm selling this is because they had duplicates! Likewise be sure to notice every dent and scratch on the salesman's gear. the only reason you're actually buying it is because you need a replacement untill you can buy some proper gear.

* Mention competition: It's not like you HAVE to buy from this guy. If you don't like his prices you could just buy from the guy down the street. in fact you were just checking prices for comparison before going over to his place. No other vendors in the town? No problem, you're a traveller after all, you'll be in another town in a few days and you can just take your business there.

* Good relations: The vendor obviously want to be in good standing with you: everyone knows adventurers are loaded, and they want to do business with you again. Not to mention you've had several meetings with the lord. If the court knows you slayed the enemies with his gear business will come booming in.

* Friendship/flattery: You can't buy bread with happiness, but your arguments will definitely do better if you are on good terms with the vendor. Likewise treat him like he is clearly a master of his trade. Most people would not realize what a treasure you have with you to sell, but nothing escapes his eyes.

There's probably more than this, but this was what i could come up with. If you have a charismatic character this is where he shines, and don't be afraid to throw in some bluff checks when doing this.

EDIT: It seems that there isn't a codified table for haggling through diplomacy. I could have sworn i have seen one somewhere but i guess it must've been another system. That said i would still say haggling is a good idea, that should belong in a good roleplaying game, and logically diplomacy would be an associated roll, but of course - which i probably should have said from the beginning - it will only take you so far. The merchant is a merchant after all and the third time you come running and wanting discount he'll probably be sick of the sight of your face, and might even charge you extra. Such is life when you as a player want to make price a negotiable thing, not to mention a good GM will always find a way to make you regret it when you start abusing GM favors.",,False,self,t5_2trms,1366131232.0,,,True,t3_1cgkee,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1cgkee/the_art_of_haggling/,

1359441957.0,32,self.Pathfinder_RPG,17hfyz,Making your own standies for Pathfinder. Images linked in the text.,north49er,36,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/17hfyz/making_your_own_standies_for_pathfinder_images/,"I'm sharing a brief guide here for creating your own NPC or PC standies for tabletop play.  I use the plastic base stands from the [Pathfinder Bestiary Box Set](http://paizo.com/products/btpy8tj5), and create my own inserts for them using Shrinky Dinks inkjet paper.

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/ED3UW) you'll find a brief photo album showing the process.  As a subject, I chose a mini I created for my character from a campaign that recently wrapped up in our playgroup. (Sculpted out of green stuff and painted with acrylics, if you're curious.)

Once I had a good photo of him, I pulled it into photoshop for some editing.  The key points here are removing the background (if you want a white background, as I did), resizing the image, and washing it out.  In the case of the character here, I wanted the standie to end up as a medium sized creature standie.  Through trial and error with the shrinky dink paper, I'm found that a printed image width of about 2.5 inches comes out right, with the height a little over twice that.

Once sized correctly, the image needs most of the color washed out of it.  When you bake the shrinky dink paper you print this on, it shrinks- obviously.  This has the effect of concentrating the ink into a smaller area, so anything you print gets way darker once it shrinks.  Using a white background for the image makes this easy, as you can just adjust the opacity of the image layer over a background layer in photoshop or GIMP for a quick and easy faded image.

If you're careful to align your images on the sheet, you can easily print  standies that have images on both sides.  Once printed to your satisfaction, cut apart and toss into the oven, following the directions that come with your shrinky dink paper.  If all goes well, you have tiny version in about two minutes.  

What makes this work is that the shrinky dink paper thickens as it shrinks, and when it's done it's at just the right thickness to fit into the stands that ship with the Bestiary Box.  If you have some talent with image editing and google, you can whip up standies for damned near anything in just a few minutes.  The result is a standie that is made from thick, tough plastic, and will stand up to a lot of wear.

**Image 1** is the photo of the figure.
**Image 2** is the edited photo, ready to print on the shrinky dink paper.
**Image 3** is meant to show you the approximate size of the printed image.
**Image 4** is a before/after shot of the shrinkage you can expect.  The middle piece is uncut, as it came from the oven.  The far right piece is after a little dremel work, as the edges probably will not quite be a right angles after shrinking.
**Image 5** shows the original figure, standing proudly with his new. somewhat flatter twin.

I get my shrinky dink paper from Michaels, but I would imagine any arts/crafts supplier has it available. Hope this is helpful to other DMs out there, as an easy way to spruce up the gaming table.",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_17hfyz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/17hfyz/making_your_own_standies_for_pathfinder_images/,
1355210448.0,31,self.Pathfinder_RPG,14nljf,Sharing the story of my most recent campaign's season finale,spoofofreality,36,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/14nljf/sharing_the_story_of_my_most_recent_campaigns/,"So, to set the scene for you guys, I was the DM for a group that's been going since September.  The party consisted of a paladin, a sorcerer, an alchemist, and a rogue.  This was a mostly homebrew setting, with various bits taken from Golarion.  The main quest of the campaign was that, a thousand years ago, a deity had been shackled to a mortal shell, and in a few years' time, that deity would be released.  However, when that happened, it would also tear open rifts to the Abyss on a global scale.  This is because the spell that allowed the deity in question to be trapped in this way was given to the people by Abraxas, Demon Lord of Forbidden Lore.  The players had to choose between releasing the deity or preventing her escape, by killing her.  Essentially, they had to choose between killing a goddess or dooming the world.  Conveniently, the deity in question was also an extremely good one, and our paladin was extremely devoted to her, so the choice was a hard one for him.

Anyway, last Saturday was our final session of the semester (we're a bunch of college kids), and I had the party entering an ancient vault where the BBEG was performing some ritual.  He was a chaotic neutral wizard, who up until this point had been thought to be assisting the Abyss.  The party hacks its way through the demons, as well as some of the vault's traps and guardians.  They find that the mortal shell of the deity has been found by the BBEG and brought here, stored in an enchanted safe room.  They must enter one at a time, and roll a d100 to see what happens.  Paladin rolls a 98, is brought face to face with a magma dragon, who questions his loyalties.  Paladin answers that he is wholeheartedly devoted to his deity, and his eternal soul belongs to her.  Magma dragon takes the form of a little girl, and exits the room with him.  She's the trapped deity.  Finally, they reach the main chamber of the vault.  Descending the stairs for hours, they finally reach a massive underground cavern, where they find the BBEG in the middle of his ritual.

Sorcerer rolls his spellcraft, finds out it's some sort of awakening ritual.  Party moves in, BBEG gives his monologue, tells them to come and see what awaits them.  They look down a grate in the middle of the cavern, and see the Tarrasque in its slumber.  BBEG wizard is downright insane, and wants to wipe out everything, all for the sake of chaos.  They fight him, and bring him unconscious.  Party is fighting over who gets to finish him off, when the little girl walks up and snaps his neck.

Then shit hits the fan.  His ritual is disrupted, and opens a portal to the Maelstrom, because he was channeling powers from a Protean.  A Keketar is summoned, and it traps the players in a demiplane.  The Keketar tells the party there is only one way for them to escape, and they begin fervent discussion/arguments over what to do.  The alchemist wants to invoke Asmodeus' help, the paladin wants to stab himself with his Holy Avenger and use a holy relic within him to restore his deity, the sorcerer wants to bluff the Keketar into releasing the Tarrasque, and the rogue wants to fight the Keketar directly.  Eventually, the paladin gets sick of debating, and says ""I plunge my sword into my chest.""  At which point each of the other players immediately says that they do the action they prefer.

So basically, the paladin commits seppuku, and releases his deity in full force.  The alchemist's call to Asmodeus damns him, but Asmodeus gives him use of his Ruby Rod.  The sorcerer is attempting to release the Tarrasque.  The rogue is trying to stop the sorcerer.  In the end, the alchemist uses the Rod to channel axiomatic power and vaporize the Keketar, vaporizing himself in the process, the paladin and his deity are whisked off to Heaven, and the sorcerer and rogue are trapped forever in the Vault with the Tarrasque.  Next semester we're starting a new campaign set 10 years later, where the entire world is feeling the effects of this session.  Since the deity was released, the denizens of the Abyss are flooding into the world, and the mortal races are fighting for their very existence.

I freaking love tabletop gaming.

I'm part of a recently-started group full of rookies. Our DM has been playing multiple editions for multiple years, and knows his stuff. I was playing a mountain orc fighter. When I say playing, I mean really playing... I was roleplaying like a monster. Doing orcy things left and right. Shoddy tactical decisions. Intimidation rolls against things bigger and meaner than me. Trying to solve problems with brute force as often as possible. Constantly suggesting, and being shot down by the group's paladin that we ransack/murder/eat friendlies, etc. All in an orcly voice. It was a lot of fun.

We came across a shaky bridge across a ravine tonight. As the other PCs were figuring out some convoluted method of affixing safety lines with rope via grappling hook or something cowardly like that, I charged across the bridge, lost my balance, and fell to my death.

Here's where my conflict of emotions occurs. I understand that playing a character prone to rash decisions makes my life drastically more dangerous. However, everything I've read in regards to group mechanics suggests to me that DMs usually reward players for staying unwaveringly in character, which I did to the last. I'm confronted with a troubling dichotomy of DMs being expected to reward players who stay in character, and playing a character who intrinsically makes ill-advised and tactless decisions. I don't blame the DM, he rolled fairly, I guess I'm just bummed out about my first ever character death and want some support. It's just a game, so I suppose I can't get too bummed. I'd love to hear some of your similar stories. What's the worst thing to ever happen to you while playing, and how did you deal with it?

My group just escaped from one plane, and fell into the lich's plane. The lich's plane is basically a constructed copy of Southwall, except with undead inhabitants. The group had some fun with the robot like zombies that were pretending to live out normal lives, and they had some fun convincing a few wights that the ""living caster"" they heard shouts about is actually the other wight that was running away from them.

The group consisted of a female elf witch, a male sylph fighter/duelist, and a female halfling rogue/wizard/arcane trickster. They are all around level 9. The witch and the duelist got captured. the arcane trickster did that thing rogues do, and hid. The AT(Arcane Trickster) then snuck into the dungeon to rescue them.

Now, once she got into the dungeon, they had to get out. This is a good time to mention that both the witch and the duelist were completely naked. Why? If I was a lich, and I had a 30 Int, I would know that it's a bad idea to give adventurers any method of hiding magical daggers or tools on them. So, the AT sneaks into the dungeon, having previously acquired the team's gear, and gave them their clothes back. So they have to sneak out, which involve getting past a single wight guard.

To get past the guard, the Duelist uses a homebrewed called shot to the head to mute the wight by cutting off his jaw. He makes it, they are out of the cell, etc. The witch disguises herself as a wight, and pretends to be escorting the ""prisoner"" Duelist out of the cell. The AT goes invisible and does that thing that rogues do. The party then decides they want to confront the lich. Now remember, the Duelist has to be completely naked for all this, to keep up appearances.

The lich was intended as a villian that the party would have to group up to defeat, and perhaps do some leveling beforehand as well. So the lich is a level 15 universalist wizard with a ring of freedom of movement and some other fun stuff. When the party confronted him, it went about as well as a goblin punching an owlbear. The duelist fails to maintain grappling him, the witch fails to curse him, the AT fails to sneak up on him, and he succeeds in casting greater invisibility and summoning an elder earth elemental. It's at this point that the party decides (wisely) to run, and they do so by jumping out the window.

But they can't outrun a flying lich. So the witch and the AT, both capable of casting fly, decide to pick up the Duelist and fly away. Remember how he was naked?

The session ended with a female halfing and a female elf flying through the air holding a completely naked male sylph as they try to flee an angry lich.

I'm currently commissioning the groups best artist to draw that scene.

Bonus points: He grappled the lich naked.

But some weeks I just don’t have that much story to write(like when the players are in a dungeon and must pass a trial of riddles or solve chess puzzles while the others defend them, and you know that what you have written will suffice for 1 to 2 sessions.) On those days, Reginald Shoe(my old gnome Sorcerer and avid magical item craftsman) pays a visit to my little corner of Holden and drops off goodies for the players to find as loot. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gauntlet of Split personalities. Cl(5th)

Description: A leather glove with a face drawn on it.

Ability(s): Allows the player a second will save, must take the second result even if its worse. 

Fun: The glove often animates in and out of combat trying to kiss the player or assaulting the player with insults. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod Of Health Cl(10th)

Description: A Mithral rod with Gold and Silver snakes intertwined around it.

Ability(s): Touching a creature at -1 or less hit points automatically stabilizes it.

Heal (100hp) Useable once per day

Cure Serious, Mass once per day outside of combat


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Never ending bag of Old Toby Cl(10th)

Description: A small brown tobacco pouch with a vine like cord holding the bag closed.

Ability(s): This bag contains 1oz of finely ground Old Toby Leaf, Smoking this leaf gives -2Int +2Wis for 1 hr per use, these bonuses and penalties can stack with multiple usages up to -8Int +8Wis, the bag contains enough Old Toby for 30 uses. The bag refreshes its supply every 7 days. 

Fun: The bag is a reference to Hobbit Leaf or Old Toby or as we on earth know it, Weed. I and some of my players like to smoke recreationally, and thus one day the item was born. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Goggles of Future Sight Cl(12th)

Description: An adjustable Leather strap and Brass frames make up these seemingly mundane goggles.

Ability(s): These goggles allow the wearer to see roughly 2-3 seconds into the future and act accordingly, however this effect is very disorientating at first and often causes the wearer to vomit. This translates to a +4 bonus to Reflex saves as long as the wearer success in a DC 20 fortitude save first (this save decreases by 2 for every successful use in combat leading up to DC 0 meaning the wearer has become completely accustomed to the device.)

Fun: This item can be used to make a Player seem far more bad ass-ed then they really are in out of combat situations by catching things thrown at them from behind to great effect on their intimidate DC's. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
APA-500 (aka Insta-Limb) (Cl 14th)

Description: Tiny red capsules that come in a very difficult to open jar.

Ability(s): Taking one of these pills acts as the Regenerate spell when taken orally.

Fun: Very simple and far more fun for players then scrolls, I gave my players 7 of these pills, the first one they ever took was to recover the Fighters lost eye(at the time they had no idea what they did), the bard then cut off a finger and took one, after it regrew they knew what they were and used them very sparingly. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bag of Breath Cl(12th)

Description: This every shifting and squirming bag shifts colors every few seconds in the most unsettling of ways, why anyone would open it and undo the chain around the top is a mystery. 

Ability(s): Once per day the bag will release the Breath of a randomly chosen adult dragon.

Fun: The bag has a secondary ability that is hidden from the players,  when used by a smart player Int 15 or more they can roll 4 times on the chart and pick from those rolls by predicting the pattern on the bag. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anymug Cl(15th)

Description: The mugs cup is made out of a green hallowed out crystal pillar, the handle is forged of adamantium and the rings attaching the two are gold, engraved with arcane symbols and inlaid with precious jewels. 

Ability(s): This mug while susceptible to heat hotter then boiling water and very vulnerable to acid is able to create any non-magical liquid in existence. This ability can be used at will. 

Fun:The secret to this mug is that if you place a potion inside of it, it will consume the potion. This allows the mug to make 6 copys of potion for the day, afterwhich the potions will louse their magic as well as mugs ability to make that potion, adding a fresh potion to the mug will allow it to mimic that potion for the day. These potions act at ½ the effect(must drink two potions to achieve effects like Enlarge Person.) of the original and become inert when a player tries to sell them. 
(Also, ya, a complete rip off of the Anymug in Goblins Comic, but with my own flavor)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Springheel Boots Cl(7th)

Description: Plain leather boots with a bit more heel in them then most men are comfortable with, however the heels hold springs enhanced by magic.

Ability(s): Allows the user to jump an extra 20ft weather its vertically or with a running start. 

Fun: My players have made great use of these boots even tho sometimes NPC's mistake the bard for a crossdresser.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pants of Ample Pockets Cl(9th)

Description: These brown pants look quite mundane from the outside, however some of the pockets are quite a bit deeper then one would think possible. 

Ability(s): The pants come with a minimum of one pocket that functions as a bag of holding, minor, however you can roll a d4 for the number of pockets that act in this way Max of 4 special pockets. 

Fun: These pants have been used to great comedic effect as well as allowing the players to think beyond, “Does it hit things? No! I don’t need it.”


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draconian Armor of Swift Girding Cl(7+AC Bonus)

Description: Armor befitting a dragon of standing, it can be made of numerous materials tho the most common is gilded steel. 

Ability(s): This armor jumps onto the dragon as a swift action when the command word is spoken and removes its self in a similar fashion. This also improves the Dragons tail attack damage by one step by adding a weapon to the end. The AC bonus varies. 

Fun: This was made for the Bards pet(?) silver dragon who was hurting a little when it came to AC (having only 19 AC while the average party member had 22+)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Necklace of Fake Personality Cl(4th)

Description: A beautiful crystal pendant is inlaid with gold and silver and hung from a silken string.

Ability(s): Gives the user +4 to all Cha based skill checks.

Fun:The story behind this one is that when I was first getting into Pathfinder someone described that Cha score was related to how personable and pretty you were, so I asked if I like garlic does that give me a penalty to Cha? Thus the joke was born that I used this trinket to combat my love of garlic frys and their damage to my breath.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod of Aquatic Mastery Cl(16th)

Description: This rod is made from a solid orb of opal whose cracks shift around always forming images of waves crashing against a golden beach. The shaft is made from silver and gilded shells form the grip of this beautiful rod.

Ability(s): Passive: Gives the owner gills when they enter water deep enough to swim in. Also allows the owner to detect the presence of water within 30ft of her current position. 

Move Action: This ability allows the owner to grow flippers, increasing her swim speed to 100ft for 6 rounds per day, they need not be consecutive.

Swift action: Three times per day the owner is able to cause a tendril of water to appear out of an appropriately sized pool of water, this tentacle has a 15ft reach and deals 1d6+4 damage to creatures it strikes, it must succeed in a ranged touch attack using the owners stats.

Full round Action: Once per day the owner of the rod can pull from any suitable source of water to encase a target in water, he may hold the water around the creature with a standard action, this effectively drowns the creature, DC 25 reflex to escape from the water. 

Fun: Recently introduced this rod in my game and cant wait to see how players use it in upcoming fights.

It needs some work, but that’s what your brilliant minds are for. I’m aware that people find rogues underpowered, but I’m of the opinion that every class has a chance to shine.

A two-weapon rogue is a raging flurry of damage, but suffers from needing to dex deny or flank a critter and have a full-attack action to truly excel at their sneak attack.

A scorpion whip is a light one-handed weapon that, if you are proficient with whips, can be used with a 15 ft. reach. It also does damage to armored opponents without the whip mastery feats. However, weapon proficiency (whip) and weapon proficiency (scorpion whip) is a little feat-expensive. You can pick up both with a level of bard AND a level of Calistra cleric, or try for an heirloom weapon.  You might also be able to argue that the light scorpion whip can be used with exotic weapon proficiency (whip) as a regular whip without the improved damage and armor ignorance.

However, if you combine a pair of scorpion whips (preferably +1 agile), a Goz mask or fogcutting goggles, and an eversmoking bottle, you’ll have the same amount of attacks as a shortsword two-weapon fighter, but you’d have 5-15 ft. reach, concealment vs. anyone 5 feet away, total concealment from anyone further than that, and ability to see through your own fog. Also, you’ll have essential invisibility when in your comfortable reach (10-15 ft), giving you the sneak attacks, flat-footed AC and a -2 AC for being completely hidden.

1: Two-Weapon fighting (1d6 sneak attack)

1 (human): Weapon proficiency (whip)

2: Weapon Training (whip)

3: Whip Mastery (2d6 sneak attack)

4: Finesse Rogue

5: Combat Reflexes (3d6 sneak attack)

6: (combat trick)Agile Maneuvers (reasoning? Disarm and Trip from distance and concealment means no attacks of opportunity)

7: Improved Whip Mastery (4d6 sneak attack)

8:(Fighter) Improved Two-Weapon Fighting

Once you’re there, you can start gaining fighter levels to get to BAB +11 for greater two-weapon fighting three levels earlier (Rogue 7/Fighter 5 instead of Rogue 15) or you can choose to stick with rogue for the sneak attack godliness. The question is, do you want to have 6 attacks at level 20 that are hitting for whip (BAB: +15/15/10/10/5/5 1d4+10d6+? each) plus rogue talents or 7 at (BAB +18/18/13/13/8/8/3 with 1d4+4d6+2(weapon training’s)+?) with 7 extra combat feats?

Eventually, you’ll have opponents with blindsight or magic (though I can’t think of anything that cuts through fog like the Goz mask). In that case, you have to rely on your frontline fighters to flank with you.

What do you see with this build that I missed?

Up to this session, I had been playing a fighter and my wife a cleric. She was not enjoying the cleric so much, and I had read some interesting things about wizards, so we asked our GM to let us reroll our characters. The whole party is a bunch of first-timers, so it's somewhat expected that people would have to change things, so he said yes.

The wizard I'm playing is going to do a lot of supporting (like [a support in League of Legends](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0jZWS0Bhhk)). I was kind of worried about the limited amount of spells at level two, since none of the level zero spells have much combat utility. But I found that in the Caverns of Wrath (Runelords), two preparations of Grease and Color Spray and one preparation of Protection from Evil ended up making me extremely useful. Spoiler: [I caused the three-armed goblin miniboss to fall with a grease, and the AC penalty against melee allowed our fighter and druid to eviscerate him in just two rounds. I also stunned two Sinspawn with Color Spray, and managed to cc the boss Quasit for two rounds with a Grease and a Color Spray, while also helping our fighter with her saving throws.](/spoiler) Honestly, with as much as I was able to do with these fairly wimpy spells, I can't wait to see what kind of effects I'm going to be able to produce at higher levels.

I guess my only point is, again, like in League, it can be easy to underestimate the effectiveness of utility characters.

Our mission essentially was to discover evidence of a 1984 style cover up wherein a person just ""ceased to exist"" (all record of that person vanished, nobody acknowledges that she was ever even a person etc.) All the while a roaring party is occurring in the embassy.

Our group:  half orc  barbarian, half elf rogue/bard (my PC) human sorcerer (with animal companion), human paladin, human inquisitor, human cleric.

The one hour time limit to complete the quest also stipulated that we had 6 strikes at being detected.

Onward!  After narrowly escaping full on detection through a series of humorous chances and displays of cunning(imagine a half orc working in the embassy kitchen chopping potatoes with his battle axe), our group encountered a cypher code essential to our mission.
Dead stop. For an hour real time we just could not break the damn thing.  Very frustrating. 
Our GM prodded us on whereby we discovered an air vent leading to an underground library where we fought an animated chair(we could not defeat it due to time constrains) and discovered the pertinent documents relating to our quest.
My rogue was still quite bitter at the indecipherable cypher and decided to ""burn this mother down.""
Striking flint on steel over ancient chelaxian tomes, a fleet getaway ensued. 
Luckily the fire proved to be advantageous in our getaway and we managed to evade detection in the commotion after casting grease on the shoes of a few guards, of course)

Long story short, our quest was a success even though we failed all the challenges and bumbled through like a group of complete amateurs. Which we totally are. 

This was the fourth tabletop game we had ever played and while frustrating and looooong i think we all truly fell in love with RPG s last night while staring into the roaring flames of the chelish embassy.

 As the title states, my players killed the Great White Whale. It went down like this: It's morning and stormy. The pirates of the Shiver, weresharks all (due to circumstances that were nearly as awesome as what is about to be described) were doing what they could to not get lost in the driving wind and gale-force winds. Suddenly the Great White Whale breaches, slamming itself down onto the middle deck of their ship, and capsizing it with a mighty CRACK! Nearly instantly, 19 crewmen were crushed to death under the massive bulk of the fifty-ton monstrosity. 

Needless to say, my players shat bricks. They had been rolling a random encounter, and this thing popped up. I was freaking a little, torn between wanting to spare them from what could very well be the death of the entire party, or holding true to the roll, and making them grit it out. I chose to grit it out. 

As the whale slides off the ship, and the Shiver rolls into the bucking waves of the stormy seas, the players pick themselves back up, most are nearly dead, (four of the five are in low single digit territory, two are at 1hp.) All are wounded. The Tengu rogue was belowdecks, and is the only one uninjured, and he starts to shout for all hands to shift to wereshark. He knows, like all the pirates, that the ship has capsized and will probably sink, but they're weresharks, if they can manage the check, they can survive the water. Then all they have to do is survive the Great White Whale. 

The Storm Druid, that's been fighting desperately to steer the ship is thrown into the water from the impact of the breaching whale, and hits hard, hurt, and scared, he shifts to hybrid form, and tries to gather all the remaining pirates that had been on deck to him. The Soulknife tries to attack the whale in the water, but is smacked hard by the whale's tail. It begins to look dire.

The Tengu Rogue, and the pirates belowdecks manage not to panic. Having shifted, they boil out of the ship, ready to fight to the death to save themselves. That's when it happens. The Druid casts Pup Shape, (from Ultimate Combat). Hilariously, he'd tried this earlier multiple times on numerous creatures it could not work on. I roll the whale's Fort-save, and stare, shocked, at the natural 1. I got a total of 22. Not the 23 needed to save. In stunned disbelief I describe the shockwave of water created by a **fifty-ton behemoth** suddenly turning into a dog-sized carp of a whale. 

But the fight is not over. No. The Sharks are in the water, and they've formed a shiver (that's what a huge group of sharks is called) and are circling the whale. They locate it and attack, since by the nature of being a wereshark they're evil, they do not have to make a will save. All miss, save two of the pc's. The size of a dog it may be, and it might only have 1hd for the duration of the spell (five rounds) but it's still got a base 28AC, +4 because it just got shrunk. Two of the players manage to roll natural 20's to attack. The first bites, but does minimal damage, and it doesn't die. The second chomps down, and does max, killing a 225hp Great White Whale, with two total d8 bites, in only four rounds of terrifying combat. 

The Pirates surge to the boat, and with the remaining forty crew, manage to roll it like a barrel back upright. Then they go to work. The party has to delve into the Belly of the Beast (think Jonah and the whale, but the whale is dead, and not quite that huge.) I pulled a dungeon crawl, complete with partially digested Grindylows out of my ass, that the party loved almost as much as the 'fight' with the Whale. In it some very nice loot was found. 

The party limped into port, dragging the corpse of the whale with them, and were hailed as heros. Now I get to spend the next week deciding how they will spend their week in port, while the ship gets fixed, they get their cut of the loot, and generally live up their new-found fame.

In both cases, I've found it's a fantastic introduction.  The ""dares"" at the beginning introduce them to skills and the idea of rolling d20s, the combats are simple enough to make them comfortable with the system but have potential for getting into the more intricate mechanics in a fun way.  Bull-rushing Vorka over a rail?  Check.

It's fun and light-hearted and silly, but even more, the pre-made characters are different enough from us as humans that it really does force even the most recalcitrant players to really *role-play*.  In both cases, my players ended up really acting like goblins, in one case they left a player to bleed to death while they went to oogle over the treasure at the end of the final fight, in the second game they ended up fighting over some treasure early on, to a point that two characters were unconscious (which meant that they burned a bunch of resources early and let me really challenge them with the fight at the boat).

Lastly, it distills Pathfinder (and D&amp;D, really) to it's most fundamental essence.  You're killing dogs and horses, but it feels like you're really battling monsters.  When the fighter tonight, the last player conscious, rolled to confirm a critical threat against Vorka at the end of the session, the tension riding on it was so palpable, and the cheer that rose when it came up a 17 and I said ""describe your killing blow"" was exactly the sort of moment that I GM (and role-play generally) for.

So I recommend it to all of you for introducing people to Pathfinder, and to roleplaying more generally, and I'd love to hear about the games (modules or homebrew) that you use for that task.",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_16zbw0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/16zbw0/just_ran_we_be_goblins_for_a_second_group_of/,

The Half-Orc Barbarian with Great Axe and Cleave.  The uber-healing Cleric.  The Flurry of Blows/Sneak attack Monk/Rogue.  These are not characters.  These are gimmicks.

These are one trick ponies which leave your character grossly under prepared for the other important elements of tabletop gaming: the roleplaying, the story, the adventure.  Your character not only has been created only for combat but has been created for only one type of combat.  Additionally once you play the gimmick you soon find yourself bored because the same trick over and over grows stale, and you have nothing to fall back on.

Consider this process in reverse.  Create a character, a backstory, a personality, some flaws, some layers.  Create this THEN add your gimmick.  Now you have something much more dynamic, something much more substantial to play with.  Now you are playing a character with a cool skillset, rather than a one note circus trick.  You do all those ""cool"" things that your gimmick vision allowed for AND you have someone who can interact significantly outside of combat, outside of that gimmick.

I expand upon this further in video form [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvYKy-L9USI&amp;feature=youtu.be).

This happens for two reasons:

 1) I don't want to take up too much attention and seem to take over the game.  I'm not all that experienced in rpgs, but there's always someone way newer than me and I try to leave opportunity to let them try to have some limelight and development and always think of how I can help without taking over.

2) I never know when people are going to be problem players, but simple things like 'shouldn't we get back to the plot and not try to have sex with werewolves' from me have caused screaming fits from players that have lasted over an hour from new players.  Thus I try to just go along with whatever random stuff other players are doing and adjust my character from there, usually becoming something of a quiet character who seems not to care about a good many things.

I'm joining a new game with a player I really enjoy.  There are two other players who are very new to rpgs and--from what I've heard--show the problems of 'chaotic neutral', as one took a dump on a goblin dog after they killed it.

Originally a party of six, we had already lost one member of the party to a fight leading up to the BBEG. We decided to push forward as we knew we were close. 

So, we burst into the room and there he is. He goes into the standard evil bad guy monologue talking about how the party has thwarted his evil plans, but we were still too late and takes a potion. No worries for us. We are used to fighting evil. We are a party of one paladin sword and board, one paladin who uses a two handed weapon (myself), one paladin that is an archer, and one paladin switch hitter (goes back and fourth between THW and sword and board). 

The switch hitter paladin whips out a scroll of Greater Dispel Magic, and ends up having to roll to take down at least fourteen spells. He gets maybe... 1/8 of them. The monk rushes up and says screw it, I'll grapple. Due to his feats, he is able to grab the BBEG. The party actually pauses here and looks at each other. The paladins declare smite evil and move in.

The archer fires off a few shots, but actually misses every single attack. Myself and the other melee paladin set up flanks for each other. BBEG nearly kills the monk with a combination of two different spells, but he holds on. Comes to my turn. In a combination of power attack, smite evil, and a +2 disruption greatclub with holy and fire on it, I wail into the guy. First two attacks hit, so I'm like cool. The next two attacks hit as well. Thankfully, the monk is lowering the BBEG's AC. By the end of my attacks, I do right around 210 points of damage. On top of the damage the BBEG took previously, it pushes him to over 300 and he goes down. 

Again, the party pauses. It was the easiest BBEG fight we've ever had.

The party all stands there, shocked at first, before we start laughing. We had completed a BBEG fight without losing anyone. We had one.

Then, the sounds of a thousand horrific screams fill the air as the body of the BBEG starts to crinkle up like paper in your hand. We can hear the bones snap and the skin tear. Then, in a blast that knocks us to our feet, we realize why the BBEG said we had already failed. 

An undead god appears in front of us, laughing tauntingly. It appears, as if the party was too late and everything we had worked to accomplish was for nothing. It lets off a Wail of the Banshee, which everyone passes. 

Things just got real.

A new round of smites goes off. First is the archer, who fires several arrows into the enemy. We learn, that due to a series of chain spiraling around it, we only have a 25 percent chance of hitting. In the course of her rolling damage, we learn that only our smite and holy damage hurts it. So, 2d6 plus our level. The archer does about 14 points of damage. The Switch Hitter paladin whips out another scroll, this one of haste, and casts it on us that had been in melee initially. The monk takes a potion of critical healing and tosses it at the BBEG, missing him but the DM allows for it to do splash damage of about two. The other paladin moves in and isn't able to get past the hit chance. I move in, and the same.

The undead god continues to laugh and continues to taunt us. Randomly determined, the BBEG points a finger at the Switch Hitter paladin. The DM calls for a fortitude save. Sadly, he rolls a nat one and falls over dead in an instant. 

Our turn.

The monk moves to pick up items from the dead paladin for any extra scrolls he might have had. The archer goes another couple of points of damage. The sword and board paladin can't get through the miss chance. I attack, each of my attacks should have hit but the miss chance stops all but one. I naturally roll my damage but pause...

Me-""It's an undead god?""
DM-""Yes.""
Me-""Make a will save versus disruption.""

The DM pauses and shrugs. In a change of pace, he rolls the save in front of us. In an instant, his smug smile goes to horror. Another natural one, on the BBEG. I shoot up automatically and celebrate my success. The DM frowns but nods, we ended that undead god. 

In what equated to maybe give rounds of combat, I kill essentially a sub boss and the BBEG. I gotta say, I really felt epic at that moment.

So, what is everyone's most epic moment in playing Pathfinder?

* Ultimate Campaign, a new book in their Roleplaying Game book series which looks to be a DM centric book with information on how to plan and run your own campaign.
* The APs Shattered Star and Reign of Winter.  The former appears to be the first direct sequel AP and follows the first three Pathfinder APs.  The latter, from what I've seen, involves the Baba Yaga and hopping between planets!
* Paizo announced Gamespace at its banquet this evening, a brand new Virtual Table that will be available soon from Paizo's website that doesn't require a download and has presets for their APs.
* A revamp of the player companion line of books starting with the upcoming book on Varisia, with a focus on making all the information easier to find.
* Shown as ""Project Swallowtail"" during the con yesterday, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game coming out in 2013 was introduced.  According to Jason Bulmahn's facebook page it is a ""non-random cooperative deck-building game"".

They will be traveling to the second layer of Hell, Dis. Their goal is to find a litch's phylactery and destroy it. They're around level 10. They're being sent by a powerful city, so they have some extra resources as far as preparation is concerned.

First, how do you prepare to go to Hell? What resources do you need? What tools do you want?

Second, I want this to be an, ""explore the city, explore Hell"" kind of scenario, not a ""fight devils all day"" scenario. I'm debating whether they should get disguises, or Dis should be open for tourism. I'm looking for ideas as far as what a city in hell would look like. What do Devils do in their spare time? how do they treat each other? Who would visit Hell? What kind of stores and services are there?

Third, there will be a fight or some kind of conflict. How can my players get in a fight in Hell without being swarmed by all the inhabitants? What kind of interesting fights could there be?

Fourth, I want to discuss the ever loved topic of selling souls. One player expressed that she may be game for selling her soul. What kind of interesting deals could be made? What could a devil offer?

Lowest hitpoints first?  Casters first?  Do your tactics change based on the type of monster (humanoid vs. vermin)?

Related questions: When a PC drops below 0 hitpoints as the result of a monster's attack, do DMs ever continue attacking the fallen PC unto death or do you move to other standing targets?  What are your reasons?

1367385857.0,26,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1dgs1y,My Ongoing Quest to Play Every Base Class,Flame_of_Anor,30,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1dgs1y/my_ongoing_quest_to_play_every_base_class/,"Soon after switching to Pathfinder in two separate groups, I decided to get the broadest experience I could. This was almost two years ago. I decided that I would play every base class and not repeat until I had hit them all. It took me a while but I set some rules:

The character must be played for at least two sessions in order to count. If a multiclass or prestige classed character, only a base class in which he has at least half of his levels will be counted. Alternate classes and archetypes are irrelevant - a Ninja is still a Rogue, and a Cloistered Cleric is still a Cleric, etc. Here they are in chronological order - I'm getting close to being done...

1. **Sorcerer**: Adolamin, Halfling (Aberrant bloodline). Group A, GM A. I didn't like this character much in hindsight; I was still rather new to legitimate roleplaying in this new group, so Adolamin was a pretty boring character. Still, he was a good first try and sort of fun at the time.

2. **Paladin**: Kevros, Halfling. Group A, GM B. It didn't take me long in a new system to start optimizing. Halfling Archery Paladins are *badass*. I did actually play Kevros for over a year and he's still my best and favorite PC in by far the best campaign I've ever been a part of.

3. **Magus**: Penguin, Human. Group B, GM C. A separate group than the last two characters. I did actually play a Cleric originally, but it was only for one session so I'm not counting it. Penguin was a codename of sorts; the whole pirate crew had them. This character was just terrible. The reason being that my DM decided to try letting me combine Magus with guns and very poorly homebrewed some rules, then blamed me for being a powergamer when I just did what he said I could. We all try our best to forget that campaign, for plentiful reasons.

4. **Inquisitor**: Siarnaq, Nagaji. Group B, GM D. This was weird because it was in a strange homebrew setting that I was still trying to figure out, so I didn't come up with much of a backstory. It was a strange cross between the Inner Sea, the Dragon Empires, and Mass Effect. Yeah. The only races allowed were Tengu, Nagaji, Gnome, and ""Turian"" which I think is from Mass Effect. But Siarnaq was an Inquisitor of Pharasma who was all about respecting the dead and shit. 

5. **Monk**: Janus, Nagaji (Martial Artist). Group B, GM D. Siarnaq was killed by a random encounter and I brought in this guy. He was way cooler. He was a bounty hunter sent to kidnap the DMPC, which he did far more effectively than the DM anticipated, while also selling out to the BBEG Emperor for tons of cash. At the end of the campaign he conned himself into becoming the new Emperor with a pet dragon.

6. **Alchemist**: Alberio, Human (Ragechemist). Group B, GM C. New campaign, back to old DM. We were all very excited for this game which was planned to be very seafaring and piratey. Alberio was an outcast who had blown up one too many houses and been run out of town. He finally died in a fight with a high-level Wererat. He used Rage Mutagen and Enlarge Person, spent a Hero Point to get one more turn after dying, and grabbed the little guy, crushed him, and fell overboard together.

7. **Summoner**: Rigel, Halfling. Group B, GM C. Same game. I liked Rigel a lot - he was a refugee from an anti-magic society and so claimed his Eidolon (who just looked like an armored and heavily armed orc) was just his bodyguard. He owed too much money to some nasty people who sent some assassins after him, so he was very paranoid and trusted nobody. I thought there was room for interesting character growth, but everyone just hated him. I eventually got sick of him and replaced him with his successfull assassin, a Swordsage from 3.5 Tome of Battle who I thus won't discuss here.

8. **Wizard**: Pavo, Human (Conjurer/Teleportation, Loremaster). Group B, GM C. Here's the good stuff. Pavo was an old man from an isolated desert nation who was traveling the world collecting knowledge. He was also a greedy, evil old bastard and everyone loved him. He was going to become a lich if the campaign had reached that level. One of the most fun (and overpowered - 27 Int at level 8) PCs I've played.

9. **Oracle**: Malachi, Human (Battle). Group B, GM C. Pavo's long-lost son and his opposite in every way. More of a Paladin in action than an Oracle, he was compassionate, generous, kind, and just, with a great backstory that I put a lot of work into. I really loved this character. He was also killed in the second session because another PC decided to just stay home instead of trying to find and kill a necromancer, and we got TPK'd by a gray render. Fuck that game, I was so mad. I'll probably bring him back if there's ever a chance for it to make sense.

9. **Barbarian**: Iudocus, Human (Mounted Fury). Group B, GM C. New campaign, set in the desert. Iudocus's tribe had been wiped out by a mysterious plague, and he was out for revenge. When it was discovered that the plague was natural and didn't have any evil wizard or anything behind it, he left the party.

10. **Bard**: Cibran, Human (Court Bard, Assassin). A diplomat and ambassador for a royal court on a mission to prevent a war with the desert nation. I played him as a totally brilliant chessmaster-type who put on a show of being some insipid nobleman to put his enemies off-guard. Went even better once I took Assassin levels. That was a great character.

11. **Druid**: Govannon, Dwarf. Group A, GM B. Finally a new Group A game! Currently playing him. He's a borderline pacifist, only fighting in self-defense and then as a last resort. It's getting hard to justify continuing, since we're currently invading a keep full of kobolds and slaughtering them just because another PC was told she was the distant heir of some old noblewoman she'd never heard of who died five years ago. Well, we'll see where it goes from here. Any advice?

12. **Ranger**: Ekchuah, homebrew race - imagine catfolk, but very warlike and with horns. Group B, GM C. Just played a mini-campaign where we were in a strike force in a war against Hobgoblins. It was pretty fun, if simple. Ekchuah had been captured by the hobgoblins and tortured for over a year, so he hated them more than anything. He got revenge on the specific torturer, by capturing him and bringing him back home to replicate every bit of it. I creeped myself out a bit with him.

13. **Witch**: Ben Ravencroft, Human (Gravewalker, possibly Agent of the Grave in the future). Group B, GM D. Just about to start this campaign. Imagine a really angsty, rebellious 17-year old, and give him the power to control undead. I'm excited to see where this goes.

So the classes I have left are Cleric, Fighter, Rogue, Cavalier, and Gunslinger. (Gunslinger will be hard since neither of the current campaign settings I play in have guns...) Then I can play my favorite classes again - Paladin and Wizard. I did play several characters in one-shot games that didn't count: a halfling barbarian I don't recall the name or personality of, a human cleric of winter named Stark who turned evil and became an NPC after the first session, a human cavalier named Regulus who was just incredibly arrogant and self-absorbed, and a human fighter named Sinclair, a disgraced son of a famous swordsman out to prove his worth.

I had the idea of packing a huge melee weapon somewhere in my extradimensional storage space (like an Earthbreaker, Greataxe or Scythe) and using it to perform a Coup de Grace. After doing the maths, I concluded I really do need the biggest weapon I can lay hands on if I want to reliably kill the enemy with this method (the character is Small sized with a -1 strength penalty; the maths was done for using a Medium weapon since I'm not sure if a Large one will fit in the haversack).

That's a very cheap method since a nonmagical (and not even masterwork) weapon is pocket change. I also considered packing a bow or crossbow with an appropriate Bane bolt or arrow (which would likely help me do more damage), but that's a lot more expensive to keep a complete set of ammunition, and also loading bows and crossbows takes time.

My group's alignments are LG, NG, CG, and a CN. Right now, there is an impending attack on Almas, capital of Andoran, that only they know about and can prevent (long campaign leading up to this). They also know about an ultimate weapon that is possessed by Andoran lies in the city. Spies are attempting to steal it and the Supreme elect and his son tasked them to protect it. After defeating the spies, they have discovered they can control this weapon (a Sphere of Annihilation). Of course, the Cheliax (Andoran's longtime enemy) have one as well, but would never use it for fear that Andoran woudl use theirs. Essentially, it is an analog to nukes and mutually assured destruction.

Anyway, the group had a long discussion about what to do with the sphere and the talisman that controls it. And I just sat back and listened, never intervening. They discussed (no exaggeration) for almost the entire session (a coupel hours.) Eventually, they decided the Supreme Elect (who I purposely made sort of a unlikable flake) didn't deserve such power and they could do more good with it by defeating their nemesis (who is currently amassing an army to attack Almas). So, they stole what is essentially a nuclear weapon and have knowingly sparked an all out war to become all-powerful and destroy their most hated enemy. Pretty sure that makes them all evil or at least neutral. Definitely not good anymore.

I'm going to enjoy killing them next week. EDIT: Totally joking about killing them guys! I want to see how this pans out too!

If so how detailed? 

Here's my character's back story. Let me know what you think.

Merrik D’Averum (Rogue Level 7)
 
Description:  Race: Kayal (Fetchling) Height: 5’ 11”  Weight: 165 lbs  Age: 47  
Hair Color: Dark Violet  Eye Color: Pupilless Lightly glowing Blue-Green  Skin Color: Ashen Gray

Backstory: My name is Merrik D’Averum. I am of the Kayal people. As a young boy I went with my father and a few other family members to the Material Plane to trade goods from the Shadow Plane. But while we were trading with the humans a large group of bandits fell upon us leaving only me alive. I was made the personal slave of the group’s leader, Garris Craigson. I did his wash, cleaned his weapons and armor and served him his food.

After a week I picked my shackles and tried to escape. Being a skilled ranger Garris captured me with ease. I was severely beaten, but only in places that wouldn’t impede my ability to work.

Another month passed as I healed. It was around then that Garris began shaming me in front of the other gang members. It started with the occasional trip as I went by, and then escalated to pissing on me in my sleep. Shamed I tried again to escape. I figured if I failed he would kill me and at least it would be over. But this time I knew better what to do. You see over the past month I watched Garris and the others. I watched how they moved without leaving tracks. How they tracked game. Watched and learned. 

It took Garris a full day to catch me this time. Lying at his feet, tied so tightly I could barely breathe, I feared the worst. Praying for death. But all Garris did was sit me up and offer me a drink. Which I took without hesitation, half hoping it was poisoned. Then he did the unthinkable. He untied me. 

After a silent minute he began to speak, “You’ve got some skills kid. I’m a pretty good tracker and you lost me several times. To be honest the only reason I caught you was one of my scouts saw you going into the thicket you hid in and found me. Not to mention those shackles you keep picking are masterwork, not easy to open. I guess what I’m saying is I’d like you to join us. You’d be a full member of the gang, a slave no longer. What ya think?”   I began laughing and when he came closer I spat in his face.  “You murdered my family, beat me half to death, and now you want me to JOIN you!” I laughed even harder. The blow that came knocked me cold.

When I awoke I found myself across the back of a horse wrapped in a blanket which was then wrapped in rope and tied. After a few seconds of pride for the lengths Garris had to go to just to keep me contained, I started to access my situation. After a considerable amount of prodding, I finally got it out of the rider that I was on my way to Garris’ half-brother Kagin in the big city.

Kagin was a master thief in the city Longmire. As soon as we arrived the rider gave Kagin a letter. I never did get to read it, but I can only assume it retold my exploits and mentioned my aptitude for the rogue arts. The first thing Kagin did, even before unwrapping me, was place a silver collar around my neck. With a click and a small electric tingle I knew I was in trouble. As he unwrapped me he began to tell me the collar was bound to a bracelet he wore and with it he could inflict varying levels of shocking pain at will. And he did, often. 

Over the coming years Kagin honed my skills to a razors edge, mercilessly punishing all but absolute perfection. He trained me in lock picking, trap disarming, stealth, poison use, and the crafting and use of alchemical items. Whenever I would try to stand up to him or rebel in any way he would shock me into near unconsciousness and rape me. 

One day after a failed job, failed because of Kagin, he started to punish me and tell me he was going to rape me again. In a fit of rage I pushed back against the pain and Kagin froze and the pain stopped. It was then I realized Kagin had actually given me the key to my escape the day we met. He had said “He could inflict varying levels of shocking pain at “will”. The bracelet and collar bond was a battle of wills. So with a shriek of rage I went for Kagin sword drawn. He raised the bracelet and pain shot down my back. But he had doubt in his heart and I pushed the pain down and kept coming. In one fluid motion I took his hand off at the wrist and shoved my other sword up under his chin and out the top of his head. Kagin fell to the ground without a sound. Then I picked up the bracelet and touched it to the collar willing it to open. 

After a while I met a bard named Lily Long, who taught me how to disguise myself and the tattooing arts. After a time I began to have feelings for Lily. But that wasn’t Lily’s way. So one morning I awoke to find her gone. Only a disguise kit and a magical raven mask she had crafted me to mark her existence.

As the years passed I became known as The Niteraven, a hired assassin known for never failing to kill his target. 

One day I was sitting in a local pub when a man approached me with a letter….(Beginning of campaign)

He will be an old but very rich man, who thinks that even though money gives a certain respect, he still doesn't get the respect wizards and other spellcasters get. 

That's why he tried to become a wizard and learn how to do magic. But he couldn't memorize all these spells, he was fairly old after all. So he failed to become a wizard. 

Now I was thinking of making this character a rogue. 
With a high use magic device skill he would use wands/staves/scrolls created by a wizard he has hired.

Because he would be very rich the price of creating the items isn't a problem. However the time that needs to be spent to create the items would limit his access, and make sure he would not have unlimited spells. 

And because he want's to be seen as a normal wizard he wouldn't use his money, as that could give him away. So the money is only used to negate the costs for wands, scrolls, etc.

I was thinking of giving him the magical aptitude feat and the false casting one. To make sure no one notices that he's really just using items. 

I would use the (rogue) carnivalist archetype as class, because then I get a familiar, and wizards just need to have familiars.

I was thinking that to get him new items he would send his familiar to the hired wizards, there the familiar would be given the created items, and then the familiar would have to go back. This would take 9 hours, emulating the 8 hour rest and the 1 hour preparation of spells. 

This would also mean that he must choose which spells he'll get a day in advance. (he sends a note with the familiar for what he want's next.)

Now I'm curious to how balanced this would be. 
The number of item creation mages can be changed but he would get way less spells then normal wizards would be able to prepare. on the other hand, when he finishes a day without using all his spells he'll keep the unused ones.

I need help crowd-sourcing some ideas for some good fantasy racial slurs.

A bit of background: I'm starting a new campaign (Carrion Crown) this weekend. The player's guide describes Ustalavians (sp?) as ""...a wary population with skepticism, religious devotion, and superstition."" That screams of racism to me, and an intense dislike/mistrusting of monstrous humanoid races especially.

I warned my players of this but two of them *still* decided to go with monstrous races, even after I explicitly warned them (again) that they would have to deal with serious amounts of racism if they did. In fact, both seemed to relish the opportunity to roleplay that. One ended up going orc, while another went tiefling.

So now I'm trying to work out how exactly I'm going to execute on my promise. I've decided to go with a ""US Deep-South"" flare (been watching a lot of House of Cards recently) rather than attempt thick, cheesy Transylvanian accents the whole time, so there will be that additional flavour to any racial tension.

So any suggestions on how I could pull that off? Specifically any suggestions for some good racial slurs that my players would really *feel* their characters being offended by?

|  
|  
**UPDATE** I'm starting to add in some of the suggestions and ideas other people have added to the mix. Awesome stories guys, I love the odd varieties of people we create. :)  
And wow, who woulda thunk that the easiest list for a bunch of geeks to fill out in excess would be low CHA? ;)  
|  
|  
**Low STR:**  
Your character has poor muscle mass, though they may still be hearty (constitution). Being physically weak makes it difficult to physically hit people, carry a heavy burden, climb, swim, or perform physical tasks like breaking down doors.  
  
*RP:* **A)** Physical deformity (mild or low dex). Born slightly warped, or wounded horrifically in the past, you have never quite been able to build up your strength as a result.  
**B)** Lazy (or efficient!) (high int, wis, and/or cha). You were never the strongest kid on the playground growing up, but you quickly learned how to coerce others into performing difficult tasks for you. These days you go so far as to have the party lump carry your stuff for you.  
**C)** As above, but with the added bonus of being a gnome (or other prank-loving individual) who enjoys taking advantage of their less mentally gifted friends by having them do things like carry them around for fun (one of my party members does this to the Paladin, who does not mind in the least).  

|  
|  
**Low DEX:**  
Your character has poor mind-body coordination. You find it difficult to react quickly to attacks in combat or in surprising situations, and have poor hand-eye coordination when it comes to firing a ranged weapon. Complicated physical maneuvers like tumbling, jumping, and navigating narrow ledges are especially harrowing.  
  
*RP:* A) Clumsy/klutz. You trip over things and yourself, and are prone to falling over or triggering traps.  
**B)** Lame. Either through a physical deformity you were born with, or an old injury that never healed right, your body is physically incapable of agility at this point.  
|  
|  
**Low CON:**  
You have poor endurance. You are more susceptible to pain and fatigue, and more easily contract diseases and suffer ill effects from poisons.  
  
*RP:* A) Wheezy old geezer, or otherwise lean and frail. Taught/powerful muscles of whatever size may still give you great reserves of strength, but you would probably blow away in a strong breeze.  
B) You have very low pain tolerance. Could be partially mental (low will), or perhaps your body just reacts to pain more strongly than it does for others.  
**C)** Sickly (low str). Either through a debilitating disease/cancer (past and recovered but left weakened, or currently ongoing and strangely incurable) or perhaps through the practice of dark magics, your body is left ravaged and weak.  
|  
|  
**Low INT:**  
You aren't the brightest light in the harbor. You may still have good common sense (wisdom), but when it comes to complex thinking, memorization of facts, or the clever devising of intricate strategies...you tend to fall woefully short.  
  
*RP:* A) ME NAME THUD. Me hate magic, me bash heads with rock!  
B) Sticks to what they're good at, even when it's wildly inappropriate. Your average fighter, solving every problem with violence, or the highly charismatic sorceress trying to hit on everything that moves.  
C) Sticks to ideals like glue. The overly noble paladin, for example, who knows they're supposed to be noble, good, kind, and all that junk...but don't expect them to stop them from trying to heroically kick down every door the come across, even when it's unlocked or opens towards them.  
**D)** Instinctual (high wisdom). You aren't overly clever, and you don't get why people laugh when you don't understand a weird word (how is it your fault you never heard it before?), or why everyone has to make things so over complicated. You just follow your gut, and it gets you through each day just fine.  
**E)** Well-intentioned (high cha and/or wis). You always do your best to be helpful, and your best is sometimes good enough and doesn't blow everyone up? Whatever.  
|  
|  
**Low WIS:**  
You lack common sense and/or spiritual connection/understanding, and decreased willpower and restraint.  
  
*RP:* A) Absent-minded but clever (high int). You lose touch with reality as you spend so much time thinking about problems and theories outside of the now. You are less concerned with the 'simple' things like how to cook or saddle a horse, and prefer to let others perform such 'menial' tasks for you, in order to make better use of your time. This may come across as cocky and jerkface (low CHA) or simply absentminded and perhaps even mildly endearing (higher CHA)  
B) Coward. Your willpower has only ever been strong with your desire to live (or similar motive). You are easily frightened, and may even run away when tested too sorely.  
C) Shiney objects! You are easily distracted, as your poor restraint leads you on a merry romp from one disaster to the next. Occasionally your good luck pulls you out of bad situations, but one of these days you may just get everyone killed.  
**D)** Low intuition. You don't maintain an easy grasp of the eb and flow of natural conversations and situations, and tend to push things too far, or not go far enough. You may come across as awkward and/or rude (low cha) or just someone who doesn't know their own (or others) limits.  
**E)** What if...? (high int) Your immense curiosity and desire to learn inevitably gets you into trouble when you approach each problem from incredibly odd and experimental directions.  
|  
|  
**Low CHA:**  
You are in whatever way repellent to others, and find it frustratingly difficult to interact with others in a meaningful way. Rarely are you able to convince someone to your way of thinking, and your inability to relate well with others makes it difficult to know how to lie or be intimidating.  
  
*RP:* A) Huge douche. Your poor self esteem or supreme ego cause you to treat others as lesser beings, and you often find their annoyance or frustration merely amusing. You don't care who you hurt or what others think of you, just so long as you get your way and have your various needs sufficiently met.  
B) Downright fugly. Something beat you with an ugly stick, or your ancestry has gifted you with an array of strange 'accessories' that most normal humanoids find at best distracting or at worst terrifying (tieflings, for example). The only problem with this, RP-wise, is it doesn't explain why you might be so terrible at diplomacy or charm if you had 'disguise self' on or something. Perhaps you're not used to being able to, but just because someone is ugly doesn't mean they don't know HOW to interact with people. People don't know how to interact with them.  
C) Oblivious. You weren't raised in a normal social environment, or you were mentally scarred by a horrific event in your past. Now, your interactions with others are best explained as 'blunt' and certainly less than eloquent. You have no social graces and find no reason why you should. Bonus points for poor hygiene! (hooray for stinky druids and rangers)  
**D)** Low self-esteem. Quiet, reserved, and unsure of yourself, you never seem to find that right moment to interject yourself into the conversation and when you do speak, no one tends to listen or take you seriously.  
**E)** A tragic, mentally-scarring past has left you introverted and prefering your own company to the company of others.  
**F)** You physically find it difficult to communicate. Perhaps your tongue was cut out, or you suffered an injury to your jaw that never quite healed...whatever the case, you tend to remain silent due to your ineligibility.  
**G)** Obscure dialect or speech impediment. Either from being raised somewhere truly 'back woods' or through a slight mental handicap, you know exactly what you want to say, but your words are never easily grasped by others.  
**H)** No-nonsense ultra disciplined. You are so dedicated to your training, ideal, or other focus that you see little room in your life for anything else. Social interaction is just a great big source of distraction.

As a first level wizard, take the spell burning hands, as an elemental-admixture wizard (so the burning hands does cold damage). Then take the feats ""Rime spell"" and ""Toppling spell"" (human of course). Then take the traits ""Magical Lineage"" and ""Metamagic Master"". Each of these traits allows you to subtract 1 from the total spell level (with errata, this caps the change at +0) of spells that have metamagic abilities applied.

End result: I cast burning hands, if you take damage (even if you make the save), you are entangled, and I get to make an intelligence-based trip check against you.

At level two, take a level of Oracle (water) and take the ""Freezing spells"" revalation. This makes it so that any time someone takes damage from a cold-damage spell and fails their save, they are staggered.

This means that at level 2, you can cast a spell to: engangle, stagger, and knockdown everyone you can fit into a 15ft cone. Total effects of making them have only 1 standard action, taking -6 to attack rolls (-4 from prone, -2 from entangle) and -6 to ac (-4 to their dex from entangle, and -4 to ac from prone), and still dealing 1d4 damage (irrelevant, mostly).

Thoughts? Comments? Any rules I overlooked?

Edit: Toppling spell is only for force spells, so instead of toppling, use ""Lingering spell"", which provides concealment within 15ft, and total concealment from 20ft or more away.",,False,self,t5_2trms,1363634007.0,,,True,t3_1ajb9a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1ajb9a/burning_hand_of_doom/,

Long time 3.0, 3.5, World of Darkness GM, first time Pathfinder GM. So this is really a question about Tabletop players and groups in general but since its in a Pathfinder game I'm sort of throwing it out here.

I'm playing in an 8 man group with 7 players, 1 DM all of which have been friends for anywhere from 5 to 10 years. We have been playing together for a very long time and there have been many arguments and agressive debates during those years but nothing quite like I'm experiencing with this campaign.

One friend is playing a Lawful Good Monk and the other is playing a Neutral Oracle. Whenever they disagree on something in game, example: (save a village of peasants or let them handle things for themselves as group completes their main mission) they begin to argue out of character and it has twice now come dangerously close to fists flying. One friend is using his in game tone (pompous prick) to explain his side and the other friend feels he's talking down to him out of game. It quickly escalates from yelling and using in game character names to yelling and using real life names. It has seriously gotten bad and is making me and the other players quite uncomfortable.

I'm looking for hints, ideas, whatever I can do as the DM to sort of squelch these. I have discussed things with others in the group in sidebars but since we're all friends and we know that one is very hot headed and the other is a bit pompous its very difficult to figure out how to change anything.

I stared at my pathfinder books for a while until something clicked. I figured I'd share it here so you can give it a try yourself, or make sure your players never ever do it themselves. After finishing it, I did a few quick google searches to make sure this hadn't been posted elsewhere. While I didn't find anything, I'm pretty sure I can't be the first person to have put all these things together.


Here's Here's what I came up with:

Step 1: Be a bard. Simply put, they play the best lyres. The Street-Performer makes an amazing Bluff build, because at level 5 they can take 10 on bluff checks, and once a day take 20. The Street Performer also gets a bonus on bluff.

As far as race goes it's important to be something that gives a charisma bump, and if possible a bluff bump from racial traits. 

For this example, I'm going to stick with a plain old Human. The Silver-Tongued trait gives a +2 bonus on bluff at the expense of trading out Skilled. This character does not need skilled.

Feats: Craft Wondrous Items is mandatory here, along with Skill Focus (Bluff) (+6), Deceptive (+4), and Voice of the Sibyl (+3)

I'm not going to say much on the topic of magic items, except that a headband of charisma and a competence item are the bare minimum.

At level 11 he's got:
11 Ranks + 3 from Trained + 2 Human Trait Bonus + 6 (Skill Focus) + 4 (Deceptive) + 3 (Voice of the Sibyl) + 20 (Glibness - note, it is possible to make a use activated magic item with this) + 5 (Archetype) + 6 (Charisma, assuming a starting value of 18 and a Headband) + 5 (Competence Item) + the ability to take 10 = +75

This goes up to an 85 if he takes 20, which he can do twice a day.

So, there I was, having finished the Pathfinder Society mini-arc where you journey to Tien and are given an animal companion AxeBeak (Giant war chicken). I was at a convention, and our task was to chase a thief through a high society bathhouse. However nobody could figure out a way in.

I'm running an evil campaign soon, and one of the major questlines will center around some Good-based nation trying to get back lost loot. They had a party of adventurers go off to this evil land to fight and slay monsters, and the party all ended up dying around this land.

Now a hundred years later, that nation wants to get back some of that high level gear the party had! The ""Evil land"" has developed into a fledgling nation of its own in that time however. So the Good nation asks/demands that the Evil nation find the gear, and maybe even the bodies, of this fabled party.

My question for you then, is what would you have on your 15th level Good and Holy warriors that would be worth trying to get back? I'm really hoping to have it entirely fleshed out, as in ""Wizard had these items... he had low fort saves and ended up dying here in this cave, where the poison gasses choked him to death... nobody could get his body so it's all still on his skeleton..."" and ""Paladin had a +5 long sword of (all of the adjectives) and sacrificed himself to a zombie dragon down in that canyon"" so that I can then have definite placement for such high level gear, and then leave it up to the party to find it on their own.

If you'd like to go a step further and even make a cameo appearance in the game, actually make up one of the characters in the party. If it's good/interesting, I'll probably plug it directly into the campaign. It might help for coming up with more flavorful/less Min-Max'ing type gear too if there is a character that goes along with the loot.

Nevertheless, the party was getting a little worried. It was the end of the adventuring day and the bugbears, waiting patiently for the kill, were poised at the top of the dungeon stairs. 

""I can get three of 'em,"" said the Magus. ""But you'll have to save against Color Spray.""

""Bring it!"" said the Paladin. 

And the spell was summarily brought. Sadly for every character who didn't list ""skulking in shadows"" and ""murdering the innocent"" among favorite pastimes, the paladin failed abysmally. More than that, being only level two, he fell unconscious at the feet of the bugbears. 

Now bugbears, as we all know, favor hit-and-run tactics when the situation allows, striking at the most vulnerable point or member of a group. These flop-eared shaggy assassins do not enjoy protracted fighting and seek to down a foe and slip away as quickly and quietly as possible. 

So the poor paladin lay at their feet, snoring gently for 2d4 rounds, neck nicely exposed. Luckily for me, the GM, all of the bugbears failed too. But it leaves me wondering...what would I have done? They're assassins. If any one of them had made the save, it's logical that they would lop off the paladin's head.

I could see maybe going with Improved DR a few times, too.  It's up to you.  Take what you like :)  

Equipment is really up to you.  I go with a couple big two-handed weapons: Greatsword and Lucerne Hammer.  With them I have all three damage types, reach, and brace.  Armor is unnecessary with this build.  It really is.  You give up fast movement so I'd go with light armor, but you're really not going to avoid anything, even if they roll a 2.  A chain shirt is fine.  

When raging, STR jumps to 30.  The power attack penalty and reckless abandon bonus offset so it's +30 to hit (+25 if you choose to apply dazing assult) 2d6 + 33 with a nonmagical Greatsword.  But the damage isn't what makes this build so stupid fun.  

Every round you can quick draw a drink (as long as your DM allows quick drawing things that aren't weapons) and as a move action down the drink without provoking and gain 20 temp hp.  This along with the invulnerable rager's DR 10/- gives you 30 points of damage mitigation every round.  You have no AC, but who cares?  You don't die!  

So attack the saves right?  He's got that covered too.  
Fort: +27  
Refl: +12  
Will: +18  
Then on top of that, he gets additional saves from Good For What Ails You and Eater of Magic.  

Even if you are taking tons of damage, you won't go down because of Diehard, and Deathless Initiate keeps you in the fight.  And if the enemy blows everything on you trying to take you down, you can use Ferocious Tenacity to sacrifice rage rounds to mitigate that damage.  You'll have plenty of rage rounds to spare because Drunken Brute's Raging Drunk power lets that drink you drank keep you from expending your rage round each turn.  

One might ask if there are deleterious effects to drinking alcohol every 6 seconds.  There would be if you weren't immune to nausea and sickened from Internal Fortitude.  

The only real sacrifice is that you can't full attack because you're using your move action to drink every round.  I could see why one might want to invest in Vital Strike feats to make up for this, but the damage is coming from his strength, not that he's swinging 2d6.  Average damage on one swing is 40.  Average damage on a vital strike is 47.  Whee...  

I love this guy.  In fact the only thing that has been known to kill it is a giant crit that gets him low enough that he can't leave rage in order to retreat.

Sure enough, here came a pretty ugly looking frog demon. (I tried to find it on SRD, but no luck) The rogues opened up with a volley of crossbow fire, but no luck, the druid spent a few rounds making the monk stronger and much more threatening while the wizard spent the early rounds trying to incapacitate the boss with no real luck. 

After the initial volley, the frog demon began to run, and ever the opportunist, our diplomatic rogue took up pursuit. The next thing you know, we have the boss trapped in a corner, the rogues both failing miserably to do any good damage on the thing and taking some nasty damage with con and charisma negatives as well. The druid and his croc make it around and begin healing after one rogue falls, and the croc tries unsuccessfully to bite the boss. 

In the last couple rounds, we knew the boss was hanging on to very little, the wizard was out of good spells, both rogues, monk, and croc had fallen and the druid who was on his last couple hit points had his shillelagh out and the wizard had cast true strike on himself. The wizard moved in and cast his last shocking grasp with moderate damage. 

It all came down to one more roll, or the frog demon would easily swat both the weak druid and the flimsy wizard down with one full-round attack. The druid swung, connected, and did just enough damage to topple the frog demon. 

The whole table collectively let out a sigh of relief when the DM said the boss went down. We spent the next hour doing what most groups would do after such a hard fight and defiled the boss' body in every way we could think of.

They come across a group of trolls and after the wizard lobs a fireball into the room the rogue rushes to the end of the hallway to get his sneak attack on.  After he dished out some decent damage it is the troll's turn.  Only two trolls can get at him as he is still in the hallway, the first one bites (miss), claw 1 (miss), claw 2 (hit, 10 damage).

Troll two attacks.  I am rolling 3 dice, a yellow one for the bite and 2 black for the claws.  I look at the yellow one, a 3, that's going to miss.  When I go to find the 2 black dice I notice that the players on one side of the table are all staring.  Both black dice rolled 20s.  Well, that is unusual.  So I pick the dice up again and roll to confirm the critical hits.  2 more 20's... OK then.  Now, our group uses a house rule that a nat 20 on a confirmation roll gets to confirm for instant death (so 3 natural 20's in a row instantly kills).  I don't normally invoke this on players but the player for the rogue insisted since it would only be fair (this rarely comes up and the players enjoy it even if it has only ever killed a CR 1/2 goblin).  So I roll again, two 5's... what the hell is with these dice?

Time to dish out damage: 2d6 +10 (claw 1), 2d6 +10 (claw 2), 1d6 +7 (rend).  Ouch.  47 total.

I look at our rogue and ask him what that puts him at, he looks at his character sheet and says ""-15, incidentally exactly enough to kill me"" (he started with 42 HP and has a 15 Con).

One of those times I wish we recorded our sessions.  This is also why I don't roll behind a DM screen, I want my players to trust my rolls.

We are actually playing Kingmaker and since the rogue was the ruler I now have to figure out how the country will take the news of their duke being murdered by trolls.  I told him that since the kingdom was prosperous and he was well liked they could likely convince folks to pay for resurrection but the player declined.

What are some spells you have created, or have seen players create/want to create?

Here's the set-up:

So the players (Druid with a jungle cat, Cleric of Iomedae, a Rogue, and an Archery Ranger) are in a large city (Magnimar, as I was just getting ready to transition them to some PF Modules) and they're all level 12-13 at this point. They get a quest from someone to investigate a mining outpost because no one has made shipments or sent word as to why. So the PCs accepted for a hefty price of 8,000 gold total, and agreed not to take any of the mining operation's supplies (I made it to be a gemstone mine).

Anyhow, *so here they are travelling up to the mining outpost when a few hundred yards out from the outpost they find a statue of a woman in a corn field. They decide ""it's nice"" and move on. Upon getting to the town they find a few more outside the buildings but these are kind of lame statues, and some have been ransacked. Finally the Rogue says, ""Wait, these aren't just statues, they're too realistic!"" and the entire party begins debating the accuracy of these claims and exploring the outpost. They all begin to bring up what beings they know can turn living people to statues, ""Wizards, yes, and basilisks....Medusa?""*

*A few seconds later, the cleric hits the deck as a bursting column of light crashes upwards into the sky from a nearby stream bed and disappears. The water begins streaming down into the newly made cylindrical hole and down into darkness. The party debates more and I decide it's time to show them what they have stumbled upon, as a giant spherical beast with a large cycloptic eye and toothy maw produces itself. Upon the top of this floating cyclops sphere are ten small eyes on top of antennae looking around in all directions.*

*A Beholder. The Party [IMMEDIATELY PANICS](http://i.imgur.com/1H4HyXm.gif) and the Cleric stands in disbelief. The ranger tries an arrow, and when that fails, bolts towards the fields. The Rogue follows, and the Druid seems confused. The Cleric finally snaps out of it and runs for her life, passing by the confused druid, who finally barks an order at her Jungle Cat. The Cat is a Statue. The Druid, crushed by the unexpected loss of her dear friend begins to panic and also scurries away, unaware of anything that's going on.*

And from the corn fields they stand, still panic stricken and confused. In essence I as the DM didn't have to do a thing during this entire session except come up with a simple story hook and every PC decided to abandon ship (though they came back next session prepared to fight). My story was just this:

Gemstone miners in a deep mountain side were digging too deep for high quality stones and opened into a Beholder lair, and in return the Beholder came out of it's lair to disintegrate or Flesh to stone all the miners and people of the outpost, wiping it from the economy.

Then I made Captain Briggs and his granddaughter Yssma. Yssma is a witch with high CHA and amazing bluff and diplomacy checks for such a low level. Two of my favorite Pathfinder moments came as a result of trying to talk my way out of a situation. 

In one instance, my party had to get into a sewer grate in the middle of a buslting pavilion unnoticed. Yssma proceeded to say, ""No worries guys, I got this"" (She used to be a ringmaster). She proceeded to get a crowd's attention by juggling and performing some circus tricks. My party got into the sewer unnoticed no problem. Then, my GM looks at me with a devilish grin and says ""All right, now how to YOU get into the sewer?"". I hadn't thought that far ahead. Then, an idea struck me. Yssma says ""Now, for my next trick, I will need some audience participation. Everyone, LOOK OVER THERE!"" Rolled my bluff, nailed it. A crowd of twenty people craned their necks to look somewhere else. I climbed down into the sewer unnnoticed when not 5 seconds earlier, I had been performing to a crowd of twenty or so onlookers. My GM facepalmed and we all had a good laugh about that.

The second instance saved everyone a LOT of trouble. Three of my party (including myself) had infiltrated a tiefling hideout. Two of them were escorted downstairs and I was left to deal with 5 tieflings all by my lonesome. Note: I have 10 AC, I would get messed up if I tried to fight. Luckily, there was a watchtower with only 1 doorway leading up. After a series of increasingly difficult bluff and diplomacy checks, I convinced all five to ""let me put on a show"" for them. I got them all to sit in the tower and have them oggle at me while I danced, slowly making my way through the entrance. As soon as I crossed the threshold, I pulled out a feather token-tree, and dropped it square in the doorway. Effectively, I had eliminated 5 enemies that would have put up quite the fight by using my wits, my words, and my boobs.

I'm Playing a level 9 Grave Knight Antipaladin (CE); there is a  Halfling Rogue, Elf Sorcerer, Dwarf Cleric, and a Strix Gunslinger. All level 10. I am only half a Grave Knight at this point because of the circumstances in which I was turned Grave Knight. Anyway, we are in a town recruiting people to our evil organization. 

One night, while we are all asleep the rogue goes out for a little B&amp;E. There is a well known merchant of magical items that also has a casino in the same building. To get in he distracted the guard by disguising himself as a child and convincing the guard  there was someone after him. So the guard runs down the alley, and the rogue runs up the stairs (stairs are outside leading up to the casino) to a point where a window to the store is located. He opens the window and locks it back behind him. When he does a guard comes running into the room, but he has a ring of invisibility and puts it to use. Guard leaves and the rogue finds a case with 3 weapons in it. He takes all 3 weapons because they are shiny, and gives them to the Sorcerer to Identify. Turns out he found a Gloom Blade, Sword of Subtlety, and a Blood-thirst Dagger(GM rolled for what they were) .

Well, as imagined, the owner of the store is pretty pissed, and offers a 100,000 gold reward for the capture of the thief. Well the rogue keeps the other two weapons, and I ask for the Gloom Blade so I can get 100,000 gold. None of the other players think I can do it, and they don't want to get the gold because they think there isn't enough time. 

So, the next day the rest of the group leaves to recruit some Dark Dwarves to our cause, and I stay back to go get some gold. So the group highers a tracker to find where the dwarves are hidden and departs. 
Meanwhile, I go to the shadiest bar I can find and search for someone that looks to be a thief. I follow him down a dark alley and come up behind him, and tell him that if he doesn't come with me I will rat about him cheating at cards. Well as you can expect that doesn't work, so I punch him in the face trying to knock him out which also doesn't work. He tries to stab me and misses, so I grapple him. I tell him that if he does what I say there is a 10,000 gold reward for him. Roll my bluff check and win (Bluff is at 19). I tell him I will tie him up and say he stole the blade and once we leave I will give him 10,000. He agrees, and once I turn him in he is killed on the spot. The merchant asks where the other 2 weapons are and I say that the ""thief"" probably sold them to someone. I bluff, and he believes me. So, I get my reward, and wait for the group.

Once they get back I say I only got 30k gold because the ""thief"" didn't have all 3 weapons. Roll to bluff and they all say that it makes sense. So, I give the thief 10k and let the other 3 split 5k. Meanwhile, I still have 85k gold.

I've had an issue with a player until recently. 

The group I currently run has 5-6 players, most of them fairly laid back (Uni students). I have one problem player however. Let's call him George. George has read every book and played since Pathfinder came out. He can tell me what page something is on when I try to think of a certain rule. Due to this he tends to argue rules with me extensively. It isn't so much trying to be helpful as he wants to argue everything to get a rule to bend to his satisfaction. He is the rule lawyer... and the Attention whore. 

I ran a special campaign with evil characters since a certain member who is leaving wanted to try it before he couldn't play for awhile. He convinced me into letting him play an overpowered monstrous race (which I thought a 2-level adjustment might work[boy was I wrong]). Anyhow, on the final night he takes up 4 hours of our 8 hour play session trying to solo a boss before his character dies. [I'm not saying I am without fault... i should of been more careful in letting him play a monstrous race...]

In the end that night was a disaster for everyone because of his insistence to ""play as his character would"" and splinter off from the group to try to solo the boss. He definitely bogged down that session by trying to be the star of the show and trying to tie everything up in ridiculous rules.

I was approached by several people in the group, annoyed by his antics and wanting him gone. They were kind of pisses off at the last session. I can replace him (plenty of other people would be up for it at the Uni). I've created a new FB group (its how I coordinate things) and I'm going to send invites to people to get it going for the new school session.

This is where I face a dilemma. People want me just to replace him but at the same time we haven't tried a softer resolution of talking to him and how his method of rule lawyering is ruining the game for everyone else. I personally think it a bit unfair to simply boot him off our game without trying to talk to him.

To sum it up: He is a pain, the other players want him gone yet I feel it to be a bit cruel to simply kick him off without trying to have him adjust his approach to the game (though I'm not sure a rule lawyer could bring themselves to play differently).

I've envisioned Room 13 as a temple where Thelsikar worships Lamashtu, and where he performs incantations.  The arcane circles are places he could perform spells and potentially summon demons, monsters, etc.

I've only been working on this for a day or so and there's still a lot of detail to be added, but what do folks think?  Would this be helpful for anyone?  Is the level of detail helpful, or does it limit your own interpretation of the adventure too much?

Also, how would folks like this to be made available?  I was thinking of delivering it as both a large map and as an 8.5""x11"" PDF, for those who would rather print it out in pieces and tape it together.  The large version could also have multiple ""states"", in which fog of war is applied on a room-by-room basis... or perhaps each room is provided separately, to be presented one at a time.

Thoughts?  Feedback?

*Edit:*

**Changes I'll be making to the map:**

1. Upon reading the background of Lamashtu, I've realized that I need to replace the statue in the fountain with one decidedly more... monstrous - probably a jackal or similar creature.
2. I think I'll remove two of the three arcane circles in the temple as three makes things too cluttered, and they're kind of jumbled together.  Besides - Thelsikar is a low-level evil cleric, so probably wouldn't be able to handle more than one of these at a time anyway, right?  ;-)
3. Not sure what color the glow in the cauldron should be - how does one brew an elixir or potency for a dragon?
4. Will be adding detail/contents to all of the rooms in the upper-right quadrant of the map, and probably filling out some detail in rooms 2, 5, 6, 7, 15, and 16.
5. The secret passageways shown between rooms 1-6, 11-15, and 10-14 have been ""covered up"" with walls in order to obfuscate their existence from players.  I have both covered and uncovered versions - I can either providing multiple versions of the map so that GMs can show one or the other as-needed, or simply let GMs draw over it with a pen/mapping tool as-needed.  Preference?
6. I am conceptualizing Room 16 as the entrance to Black Fang's lair... possibly as a ""Level 2"" of the dungeon.  In the first adventure, the map clearly leaves several large entrance/exit passageways that would fit a dragon, but this map does not.  Thus, it would make sense that you'd have to go down to this second level in order to find it.  I'm also thinking that the most likely place for a tower in the hills is... on one of those hills, perhaps one with one side that terminates into some kind of a cliff, kind of like [Half Dome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Dome).  This would allow the entrance to Black Fang's new lair to be more secret and impossible to access other than through the dungeon, to avoid unintentional first-encounters (if the party does something unexpected, such as scout the hill from the sides) to be with the dragon rather than with the rest of the dungeon.  If you want to avoid spoilers, the cave could be only visible from above, and not from below.  (Recessed top of the cave entrance means the necessary angle to view would be from level or above.)
7. I will probably do a map of the surrounding area, unless I can find one that Paizo puts out.

**Question:** Are there any other adventure paths that make use of the town of SandPoint?  Any maps of it?

Clearly, as the physics engine, it falls on you, DM, to have complete knowledge of How The World Works, so that you might impose these conditions on the players as the rulebooks impose them upon you. You're also obliged to throw in those little bits of entropy and lossiness that prevent your players from building a perpetual motion machine (or, more canonically, a peasant railgun).

We have a lot of player threads around here asking for advice on how to do one thing or another. No matter how innocuous the original poster's request seems, some comment invariably pops up about some particular combination of actions or feats or magic words you can say to the DM that make for an absurd build. (Some might think I'm joking about that last bit. I'm not. There are guides that act coy, but basically say ""See if you can trick your DM into agreeing to this condition."")

It's all well and good to say there's an opportunity cost for such optimization, but if your munchkin is just murdering his way through NPCs, his social ineptitude never really comes to bear. You could trot in your overlevelled town guard, sure, or drop a few dragon-beholder-liches into the mix, but this reeks of DM fiat, and feels like its own special kind of defeat.

It's a horror type setting/feel to the game. Demons and the like, dark arts, moral issues. Sort of pathfinder meeting call of cthulhu.

We start out at level 10, 25 point buy, full wealth of 62,000 to spend on gear and items. All races from core and advanced race guide are open. No class or alignment restrictions (I'd prefer sticking to paizo written so core, apg, ultimate magic/combat type stuff).

My to hit is a +20/22 with five natural attacks. I feel like I could take on the rest of my party.

Any suggestions for tweaks on the synthesist, and anything for another gamebreaking character? This is what the DM has asked for, so I would not want to disappoint. I'm guessing something in the beginning will break parts of peoples characters so I'm excited to see how bad it could get.

I thought I'd share to show the awesomeness that is debuffs from a level 7 bard and a level 5 witch. Didn't want to wait for the next ""how's your game this week"" thing, lest I forget details.

The boss fight went thusly:

Round 1:
 
* Boss casts Confusion, our fighter fails.
* Witch Stinking Cloud'd the boss and two archer minions.
* Bard (me) used Inspire Courage, Sound Burst the archers in the cloud, and Saving Finale to break the Confusion (Lingering Performance keeps the boost going). Fighter failed the save again, spent the turn babbling.
* Faerie Dragon (my familiar) used Grease on where the boss was in the cloud. He falls down.

Round 2:

* Boss (nauseated and prone) stood up.
* Witch Glitterdust'd the archers in the cloud.
* I move and draw my net, Inspire again, then Saving Finale again (successfully this time).
* My dragon moves up next to the cloud and uses its Breath of Euphoria. Boss fumbles and becomes staggered and sickened for 6 rounds.

Round 3:

* Boss (nauseated, staggered, sickened) steps out of the cloud (nauseated for 4 more rounds).
* Witch used Evil Eye lowering his saves and cackles.
* I entangle him in my net.
* My dragon uses Grease again, and he falls down again.

Round 4

* Boss (nauseated, staggered, sickened, evil eye'd, entangled, prone) stands up.
* Witch deafens him with Blindness/Deafness and cackles.
* I blind him with Glitterdust and bring up Inspire Courage.
* Faerie dragon recasts Greater Invisibility.

Round 5

* Boss (nauseated, staggered, sickened, evil eye'd, entangled, blind, deaf, on grease) surrenders at full health.

I'm DMing a home brew setting.  Party was a monk, rogue, and cleric (all level 1).  The cleric was new to the group (his first time playing with us), but very experienced in table top.  Other two are a bit noobish, but love the game/setting/story, and we've been playing for nearly a year.  The cleric's character is way optimized compared to the other two, and basically is hogging the spotlight during combat.  Out of combat the cleric is a little bit of a meta-gamer, but didn't come in and take over.  The RP was not disrupted, and fun was had.

The party gets to a locked door in an abandoned castle's tower.  The cleric detects no magic.  The rogue detects no traps, but is unable to open the door.  The cleric thinks he such a badass, so he decided to chop down the door.  But there was a mundane trap filled with a swarm of flesh-eating cockroaches!  The monk and rogue avoid it, and the cleric is engulfed.  

They had no aoe spells, alchemists' fire, or other method of dealing with these creatures.  The other two decide to try and help the cleric, and end up getting the roaches on themselves.  

In the last moment, the cleric triggered a magical trap that was in the room the door was blocking.  This trap did fire damage to everyone, and killed the bugs.  This was me somewhat saving the party from a TPK.

Part of me thinks it was unfair to put the roaches there in the first place, but the other part of me (who plays roguelikes btw) feels like they deserved to die.

What do you all think?

Update: alright, I got some good info from some folks.  I was also both chastised and applauded.  Strange how some people simultaneously did both.

TBH, I was worried I was being too easy on my party, but some of you felt I was being too harsh.  Oh well, we all had fun in the end, and none of the players had problems with anything (I asked them about it).

1358416256.0,23,self.Pathfinder_RPG,16qtvv,Cleric mobility tank guide,nicholsml,30,7,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/16qtvv/cleric_mobility_tank_guide/,"I'm writing this after reading a few other posts about tanks and to offer something different from the usual fighter or pally tank. If you have useful input regarding cleric mobility tanks, leave a comment and I’ll edit this guide. This guide is mostly for society play but can be applied to pathfinder campaigns to a limited extent. If you have anything to add, please share so I can make the most of this free guide :)

**Why a cleric?**

While clerics don't make the best melee based characters, they do have the best tank mobility in game and unlike a lot of other casters they have access to their spells while in heavy armor.

**AC**

This is the bread and butter of the tank class. You need a high AC to avoid spell interrupts and mitigate damage. A fighter has a slight advantage in AC at higher levels but as a cleric your mobility will be unmatched. Also Cleric tanks that have the correct domains and feats will have a much higher AC then pallies. Although pallies have an advantage with their saving throws over the other tanks and a circumstantial melee advantage with smite.

To have access to the heavy armor and tower shields you will need, you can either take one level as a fighter or spend the feats. In the long run the advantage of spending the feats is access to a better spell pool while taking the one level in fighter will give you back some feats.

You want to get your AC as high as possible. You want to focus on dodge and deflection AC bonuses within reason because they stack and they also count against touch attacks. The diminishing returns to cost/effectiveness means you simply take deflection and dodge bonuses first, you don't ignore the other bonuses, dodge and deflection just take priority and should come first.

**AC Bonuses** 

These bonus descriptions are copied straight from the [PFSRD](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/), but it is important that you read and understand what AC bonuses apply to your AC and when it applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Circumstance)**

&gt; A circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors impacting the success of the task at hand. Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses, including other circumstance bonuses, unless they arise from essentially the same source.

&gt; **Bonus (Competence)**

&gt; A competence bonus (or penalty) affects a character's performance of a particular task, as in the case of the bardic ability to inspire competence. Such a bonus may apply on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, caster level checks, or any other checks to which a bonus relating to level or skill ranks would normally apply. It does not apply on ability checks, damage rolls, initiative checks, or other rolls that aren't related to a character's level or skill ranks. Multiple competence bonuses don't stack; only the highest bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Deflection)**

&gt; A deflection bonus affects Armor Class and is granted by a spell or magic effect that makes attacks veer off harmlessly. Deflection bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other deflection bonuses. A deflection bonus applies against touch attacks.

&gt; **Bonus (Dodge)**

&gt; A dodge bonus improves Armor Class (and sometimes Reflex saves) resulting from physical skill at avoiding blows and other ill effects. Dodge bonuses are never granted by spells or magic items. Any situation or effect (except wearing armor) that negates a character's Dexterity bonus also negates any dodge bonuses the character may have. Dodge bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC, even other dodge bonuses. Dodge bonuses apply against touch attacks.

&gt; **Bonus (Enhancement)**

&gt; An enhancement bonus represents an increase in the sturdiness and/or effectiveness of armor or natural armor, or the effectiveness of a weapon, or a general bonus to an ability score. Multiple enhancement bonuses on the same object (in the case of armor and weapons), creature (in the case of natural armor), or ability score do not stack. Only the highest enhancement bonus applies. Since enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor effectively increase the armor or natural armor's bonus to AC, they don't apply against touch attacks.

&gt; **Bonus (Insight)**

&gt; An insight bonus improves performance of a given activity by granting the character an almost precognitive knowledge of what might occur. Multiple insight bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest insight bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Luck)**

&gt; A luck modifier represents good (or bad) fortune. Multiple luck bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest luck bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Morale)**

&gt; A morale bonus represents the effects of greater hope, courage, and determination (or hopelessness, cowardice, and despair in the case of a morale penalty). Multiple morale bonuses on the same character do not stack. Only the highest morale bonus applies. Non-intelligent creatures (creatures with an Intelligence of 0 or no Intelligence at all) cannot benefit from morale bonuses.

&gt; **Bonus (Natural Armor)**

&gt; A natural armor bonus improves Armor Class resulting from a creature's naturally tough hide. Natural armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to Armor Class (even with armor bonuses) except other natural armor bonuses. Some magical effects (such as the barkskin spell) grant an enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus, which has the effect of increasing the natural armor's overall bonus to Armor Class. A natural armor bonus doesn't apply against touch attacks.

&gt; **Bonus (Profane)**

&gt; A profane bonus (or penalty) stems from the power of evil. Multiple profane bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest profane bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Sacred)**

&gt; A sacred bonus (or penalty) stems from the power of good. Multiple sacred bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest sacred bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Shield)**

&gt; A shield bonus improves Armor Class and is granted by a shield or by a spell or magic effect that mimics a shield. Shield bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other shield bonuses. A magic shield typically grants an enhancement bonus to the shield's shield bonus, which has the effect of increasing the shield's overall bonus to AC. A shield bonus granted by a spell or magic item typically takes the form of an invisible, tangible field of force that protects the recipient. A shield bonus doesn't apply against touch attacks.


**Shields**

Tower shield, tower shield, tower shield. When building a tank cleric, there really is no good reason not to get a tower shield. Your offence when needed will mostly come from your spells. When you do attack it will be to make touch attacks and to gain a defensive fighting bonus, so only the effort counts.

**Armor**

Full plate is generally preferred when you can afford it. Initially its movement penalty can be offset if you choose good cleric tank domains. Also making the item mithral adds +2 to the max dexterity bonus. Outside of exotics and third party armor, full plate will be your best option in most cases. It can be feasible to use lighter armor and a higher dex but I usually don't because you have so many important stats for a cleric tank that it's usually better to go with high armor and lower dex bonus so you can spread more stat points around.

**Stats**

Dex is the most important stat followed closely by wisdom and then constitution and charisma... but you need to balance your dex with whatever armor you chose. Also take into account boosts to dex from magical items. So Dexterity is the most important stat but only up to the armor induced cap. For instance.... Full plate gives a +1 to max dex bonus. This will be upped to +3 from making the armor mithral. So with full plate make your dex 14 for a +2 dex bonus and leaves room to add 2 points of dexterity from items for a total of +3 from dex. Now you're free to add points to your wisdom and then constitution. Also be sure to keep at least a +1 or +2 in charisma for channeling.

**Feats**

You are going to want to take any feat that provides bonuses to your AC. Those feats will be dodge for a +1 dodge bonus, remember dodge bonuses stack with everything and also counts against touch attacks. Mobility is a great feat, it adds +4 AC against attacks of opportunity from movement. Remember you are highly mobile as a cleric tank and this feat is very important to you. Sometimes I purposely eat AoO's so other melee can move into flank. Shield focus is another essential feat, it adds a +1 to your shield bonus but remember shield bonuses do not count against touch attacks and anything that discounts your shield discounts this feat. So take it after getting other armor class feats. Shield wall is another great shield feat but it is only useful when you have a buddy who will be adjacent and has the feat as well. Its usefulness is circumstantial.

Toughness. At some point you will need to take this feat. While a tanks role is to mitigate damage over taking damage, at some point you are going to take a large amount of damage from something, toughness will help you survive these situations. AC is more important, but if you totally neglect your hit points it will catch up to you sooner or later. 

**Domains**

* Travel- Travel is an essential domain for a cleric tank. It adds 10 to your movement and once you gain the dimension hop ability you essentially become immune to grapples. If you are serious about being a cleric tank, travel domain is a must. All the other domains usefulness can be circumstantial/conditional, this one is essential to your mobility.

* Elemental Domains- Domains such as earth and air can be handy because of their elemental damage reduction offered at mid to high levels. For example earth gives acid DR and air gives electrical DR.

* Chaos Domain- Chaos’s ability, touch of chaos is great because it forces the next attack an attacker makes to be rolled twice taking the less favorable result. It can be tricky taking this domain in a standard society based game.

* War Domain- This domain is good because of the domain spells and buffs it offers, it is great for enhancing your party. It doesn't offer much for protection but it does give your tank a little more utility.

* Luck Domain- Luck has limited use for a tank build but it does offer freedom of movement in the domain list which can be handy for mobility.

* Liberation Domain- Liberation offers freedom of movement and helps to avoid difficult terrain. It partialy coincides with some of travel domains abilities but in some cases more can be better.

* Healing and Sun Domain- Both are handy for utility but offer little for making yourself a more effective tank. Take them only if you don’t have better options or want to combine damage or healing to your build. 

**Magical/Wondrous Items**

* Muleback Cords- Muleback cords give you a +8 to strength when calculating encumbrance. This is very useful since you have so many stats to put points into to be effective that you usually end up with a low strength. You will probably need this item to use heavy armor and heavy shields. It uses a shoulder slot.

* AC Items- Any item such as a ring of protection or an amulet of natural armor is going to be important. Take these items as early as possible and focus on dodge and deflection bonuses before others. Don't forget AC Ion stones to put in your wayfinder.

* Boots of Striding and Springing, Winged Boots, Boots of Speed- All of these items are important for mobility. You just have to decide on a persistent bonus (boots of striding and spring), Flying bonus (winged boots, less important when you have the travel domain) or Boots of speed (high movement bonus, limited number of uses).

* Stat Boosting Items- Any items that add to Dex/Wis/Con/Cha are going to be very important because they can all directly affect your survivability when it comes to health or AC. Examples... belt of might or headband of mental prowess. 

* Sash of the War Champion- The sash of the War champion gives you Armor training as a cleric, this is very useful. Basically it gives you a access to fighter armor training. The rules on this are very vague, so if you use it, read it careful and understand it might be ruled against you using it. In the end it is the GM's call so make sure you run it by your society organizer before buying.

**Prestige Classes**

* Holy Vindicator- The vindicator can be a great prestige to take because it allows you to continue to gain more channels and offers a high BAB bonus. Also it has an ability where you can channel into your shield for an extremely high shield bonus to AC until you are hit with a roll against your AC. For example, if you channel 7D6 you can add a +7 to your shield bonus, wow! Its weakness is touch attacks which remove the bonus when they hit. Take it at higher levels to piss off your GM.

* Stalwart Defender- In some cases this prestige class might be desirable but when you take it you no longer gain cleric powers that define your cleric tank. It generally isn't preferred. 

**Tactics**

* Spellcasters- One of the great parts about high defense and high mobility provided by cleric tanks is the silence spell. You are literally a nightmare for any spell casting class. Cast silence on yourself and trigger your move to follow the caster. You will effectively be moving your silence spell around wherever they go. If you picked the travel domain you will be able to fly, avoid rough terrain and have enough movement to follow them wherever they go. I have 60 movement at level 12 in full plate. Since you cast the silence spell on yourself, they get no saving throw making verbal spells useless to them.

* Compel Hostility- This  is a great spell to force opponents to attack you for a round instead of your team mates. Because of  your high armor class you can mitigate a lot of damage this way. You can only use the spell once per attacker.

* Dimensional Hop- You can use this travel ability to avoid being grappled and you can also pull team mates out of grapples as long as you can touch them. Also while the dimension hop is your movement action, it is a free ride for PCs that choose to come with you. Want to get the barbarian in fast? Dimension hop him in and on his turn he still gets his movement from where you teleported. Wizard buddy have melee in his face? Dimension hop him to a ledge or into a corner with you standing in front of him. while dimensional hop is a spell like ability, it is a move action and it specifically states that it doesn't draw attacks of opportunity. It also isn't cast as a spell because it is a move action and not a standard or full round action and doesn't operate in the same manner as any known spell outside of the domain ability.

1368820077.0,20,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1ejbvs,Why Cleave Sucks,Lucretius,35,15,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1ejbvs/why_cleave_sucks/,"Of late, I have seen a number of comments saying or implying that Cleave is actually a good feat.  This amazes me in that it is my benchmark of a bad feat.  So this post is an invitation for people to tell me what's so great about Cleave that it's actually worth expending a feat slot for.

Standards:  What makes a feat good or bad.

The value of a feat can be understood in the following mathematical formula:

	Value = Probability x Impact - Opportunity-Cost

That is to say, all other things being equal, a feat that is rarely useful is less valuable than a feat that is often useful... A feat that is useful often has a high Probability.  And, again all other things being equal, a feat that does something powerful is more useful than one that does something weak... a feat that when useful does something powerful has a high Impact.  Ideally, a feat will both have a high Probability  AND a high Impact.  However it should be pointed out that both Probability and Impact are effected by strategy, tactics, and play style.  For example, Power Attack is not much use to most wizards.  Lastly, a feat should not just be useful, but not massively less useful than alternative feats... The standard of the general value of alternative feats is Opportunity cost.

There are four problems with Cleave:  It's Probability is incredibly low.   It's Impact is at best moderate.  The Opportunity-Cost is high.  AND It has additional down sides.

**Probability**: Cleave can only work if two opponents are adjacent to one another.  This does not happen often because there is no advantage to opponents being adjacent, and numerous disadvantages to it: when adjacent to one another, they can't flank you, and are in formation to receive area effect spells.  So even before the enemies know you have cleave, they are likely going to be avoiding cleave formation by default.  And of course it's a trick you can only use once per combat because once they see you use it, they'll stop standing beside one another.  I think I'm being generous when I say that an opportunity to use Cleave will show up once every three combats on average.  Great Cleave is in some ways even worse... the probability of having more than two opponents simultaneously adjacent to each other and also in reach is even lower.  

**Impact**: An extra attack sounds powerful, but let's put it in perspective.  In order to use Cleave, one needs to take a standard action.  This means that one can't take a full attack action and use Cleave in the same round.  Now at and below 5th level, that's not a big sacrifice since one was getting only one attack anyway unless one uses Two Weapons, of Flurry, or multiple Natural Attacks.  But at BAB of 6 or higher, Cleave starts to look like an increasingly poor deal: give up two or more attacks of the full attack sequence to get two (or more if you also have wasted another feat slot on Great Cleave) attacks from Cleave.  True, all attacks with cleave are at full bonus whereas iterative attacks are at progressively lower bonuses, but that is balanced by the fact that iterative attacks can all focus on the same opponent whereas Cleave forces you into the sub optimal strategy of spreading out your damage.

**Opportunity Cost**: Opportunity cost is a term from economics.  It refers to the cost of not doing other activities because you are busy doing something else.  As such the opportunity cost for a feat is a function of the comparison of the value of other feats that could be taken in its place.  There are SO MANY better feats that could be taken in place of Cleave.  Weapon Focus... Probability is near certain that you'll use it near every single attack.  Dodge... even more certain to be useful.    Here's another way to calculate the opportunity cost of the Cleave feat: A potion of Haste at minimum caster level of 5 provides 4 extra attacks counting the lost round for drawing and drinking the potion.  If we assume a fairly standard 12 combats per level gained and use the one in three combats probability of finding side-by-side opponents that I estimated above, and assume that the opponents have an INT of 1 or higher and so separate the first round after Cleave is used in any given combat, then for a character leveling from 1st through 20th level, Cleave will provide a total of 80 extra attacks over the course of 240 combats... that's the equivalent of 20 potions of Haste.  Now, imagine you were give a choice... sacrifice your 1st level feat slot for 20 potions of Haste... would you take that deal?  Of course not, because it sucks, but taking the Cleave feat is doing exactly that.

**Down Sides**: As if all this weren't enough, Cleave also has down sides... You aren't even guaranteed to get the Cleave attack; if you miss on the first attack, you don't even get the second!  Frankly at this point as I read Cleave, I'm already extremely unimpressed, but using Cleave ALSO gives you a -2 AC penalty (as if it weren't bad enough already).

All-in-all, the only good use for Cleave I can see is that, because it's a standard action, it lets you have multiple attacks after using a move action to close with the enemy.  In essence, it's an alternative to Charge... instead of sacrificing -2 AC for a bonus to attack and the ability to move twice one's base speed and still attack, you can sacrifice -2 AC for an extra attack after a move action under certain very rare conditions.  But is this ability really worth a feat slot?

Rather than viewing the rule set as an imperfect simulation of real world physics, it can simply be viewed as the local laws of physics.

I started thinking about this because of gravity. The basic what goes up must come down still applies, and there's a terminal velocity (represented by 20d6).  It looks like it takes only 200 feet to reach terminal velocity, and acceleration is strictly linear until terminal is reached.
(Another fun flaw in the physics: an arrow dropped from 200 feet takes 20d6 damage, but an arrow with the energy to fly 1000 feet deals only 1d8 damage).
I'm not sure what the fasted possible speed is.  An extended long range spell cast at 20th level can reach 2,400 feet in one round - about 270 mph. 

But, gravity can be chalked up to ""imperfect simulation.""  That's fine.

Here's where it deviates further from physics:
1) Basic energy types.  Acid, Cold, Electricity, Fire, Sonic.  First, Cold is an energy of it's own, and not the absence of heat. An item can be enchanted with both Flaming and Frost; they don't cancel each other out.  Second, acidity is an energy type, and not necessarily a physical property, and alkalinity is not represented at all.  Further, acids aren't differentiated in terms of what they react best with (organic acids, inorganic acids, etc.).  Acid is simply a type of fundamental energy.  I find this fascinating.

2) Positive and Negative energy can also be stored and harnessed, though there doesn't seem to be quality of resistance that the five basic energies have.  Positive and Negative energy seems to simply be life energy and undeath energy - that which vivifies unliving matter into living (or undead) matter.

3) There are elemental planes, which seems to indicate that the four classic elements replace the entire periodic table.  Any material we're familiar with is simply an alloy of those four basic particles, perhaps tempered with one of the five basic energies.  Since Fire is both an element and an energy, this gives us 8 basic matter and/or force components to make an item with.

4) Morality behaves as a physical property.  There are spells which can repel creatures of a certain morality, and there are inanimate items which can be imbued with morality.  This implies (I think) that morality is a fundamental physical force in this universe.  

5) Teleportation is possible, allowing instantaneous travel over thousands of miles, and there are portals between planets.  This means that pathfinder does not obey relativity as we understand it.  OTOH, I think there's also actual time travel, so it may just be that portals and teleportation both function as extremely limited forms of time travel.  This still does squirrely things with relativity.
I'm wondering if, instead, relativity simply doesn't exist in the pathfinder universe.  There is no speed of light; light is actually instantaneous.  This seems to jive with the behavior of light and darkness spells, and the fact that invisible creatures can still see.",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_1a9ijn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1a9ijn/the_physics_of_pathfinder/,

Should they be house-ruled?,yottagray,28,4,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1a3214/crossbows_should_they_be_houseruled/,"I am running a campaign with a PC that particularly likes the idea of playing a Crossbow Ranger. I definitely want to support that, but it appears that it may be a huge struggle given the penalties of the crossbow. 

It seems to me, in order to make it viable (i.e. use them like bows), you need several feats, and even then, you can't use items like bracers of archery. Most of all though, crossbows lack any ability to add strength to damage.

I am considering house-ruling something to reflect the power of crossbows and putting them on the same level as bows. I have 3 ideas so far:

1. Increase the hit die of all crossbows (this is my least favorite)
2. Make crossbows attack vs. touch within a certain range; probably half of the weapon's range
3. All of the the above

Does anyone have thoughts on this or play with house rules for crossbows in their games?

EDIT: After a lot of consideration of all of these excellent replies, I have decided that I will not be house-ruling anything. Having considered the weapon proficiency, cost, damage die/critical,  and the lack of strength needed for the crossbow, I believe it to be a rather nicely balanced weapon.

1361709890.0,21,self.Pathfinder_RPG,194pjx,I just ran the first session of my new campaign... with 10 players. Here's how I did it.,dorkboat,27,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/194pjx/i_just_ran_the_first_session_of_my_new_campaign/,"I live in Seoul, Korea, and there is a pretty sizable gaming community of foreigners here. We're pretty tight knit on Facebook, but the life of the foreigner here is pretty transient, as the Employment system is based on One-year contracts. After the 4th Editition game a few friends and I were in ended due to the DM dealing with work drama, and my Star Wars D20 Game ending due to the DM wanting to play a game, I put out the word that I was looking for something to use the Bones Kickstarter Minis with, and Hence, Pathfinder Campaign! I wanted to skip past the first two levels of play, because Level one bores me as a DM and I had some really bad Early character death experiences with a recent online campaign, so players started out as Level Three.

I quickly got about 15 different interested individuals. I figured that the campaign itself would turn into just a few dedicated people like my last campaign in the States... but No. Three of them backed out from work issues, another Two after showing initial interest stopped responding, but that left Ten active people all interested in joining the first session. I reluctantly obliged, but after some loose prep and a lot of focus on populating the starting adventure with a lively town, small encounters, and one large uniting hook that brought the characters together, the session became an amazing experience as a DM and I've already had a lot of positive feedback from the players.

As there were a few players new to the system I made sure each mini encounter or skill test covered the range of available situations that might arise in any given session. I had six of the players come into town by three separate ships, all well detailed and populated. I rolled random encounters for them, which they solved either by Swift combat or Wild Empathy checks. The other four were teleported into town via one of the main plot devices, and the two alchemists were introduced to what would be their drug running commander. The other two were left to explore the town, but by choice they went directly to the next goalpoint, the town Brewery.

After each duo joined up, each through various means were instructed to head to the brewery to meet with the various leaders of the town. Each NPC that populated this Brewery was a mid-high level adventurer... all NPC'd, time progressed versions of Player Characters from a Campaign I ran back in the USA. As such, and as I had saved character sheets in some format from that campaign, I was able to describe each NPC in detail as needed. There was a short RP session, in which the players expressed why they had come to the town, whether it was to trade or to seek adventuring work...

And in the middle of this, I attacked the town with two large groups of monsters. One group was terrifyingly loud, Composed of two Ogres, A bugbear, and about 8 Hobgoblins, charging one of the gates of this well defended but poorly fortified town. The players left the brewery, rushing across town in a frenzy of streetwise and acrobatics checks to find their way towards the gates. The Ogres burst through the gates and made quick work of the town guards, and were slowly but steadily thinned down and kept controlled by the players until at last they had dispatched the final hobgoblin. I kept combat short by implementing the (You prepare your action and be ready on your turn to declare what you'll do, get a +1 bonus) Homerule. It really increased the speed of combat.

During this attack I had a second warband, comprised of Goblins and Goblin riders, along with a high level Ex-PC goblin sapper, who specializes in Heavy Explosives. The goblins slip in, but are smelled by the dog-mount of the gnomish gunslinger... but far too late. After running back across the town and a couple rounds of combat, having defeated almost all of the goblins, the Explosives planted in the Town Portal Building go off, destroying the main source of travel to and from the city. (Traveling by sea is dangerous, and the old highway hasn't been used in years due to the reliability and convenience of the teleportation system) After planting the explosives, the Sapper then ran into the port, lighting the ship two of the PCs came in on... that was carrying gunpowder and arms for the town guard. The Ship explodes, the Goblin sapper gets away on a goblin tinker made speedboat, and the Town is left defended, but cut off from it's main sources of food and income due to the destruction of it's main portal.

Everyone had equal playtime and every character contributed during combat. Each character had a vested interest in the town, and is now interested in surviving by finding a way to connect the town again to civilization. I plan on splitting the party and running two simultaneous groups on alternating weeks, but occasionally meeting up again in a larger group to try more mass combat oriented adventures.

What are your thoughts, have you ever tried to run a colossal sized group? How'd you do?

Some of my players are experienced, but one is not. I am new to Pathfinder, but I have been DMing D&amp;D since I was 11 (I am now 40). I am familiar with 3.x, and I know they are pretty cross-compatible, but I have a couple questions:

First, in designing the encounters for the first dungeon crawl, with level 1 players, I took the CR suggestions as gospel, meaning that I have moderately easy encounters (CR 1), a couple more challenging encounters (CR 2), and one really difficult encounter (a CR 3 wight).

I have noticed, however, that guidelines like these tend to work best for mid-level parties, since they deal with factors that can be huge differences at low level. Example: At first level, something with only three hit dice has almost three times the hit points of a first level PC. Whereas at tenth level, something with twelve hit dice only has a much smaller fraction more. The same difference in HD, but a huge difference in magnitude. 

So what I am asking is this: Despite the suggestions of CR in the book, will a CR 3 wight TPK my PCs? I intend to be challenging, but not outrageously so.

Second question: Do any of you have experience with the Artificer class made by Adamant? I really like the idea, and I am doing a home-brew campaign world with a sort of steam-renaissance sort of motif to it, so it makes sense. Is it overpowered? Underpowered? A pain in the ass to GM? I would appreciate any input.

tl;dr - I am starting a new campaign, and I want to make sure I am not windowlicking my way through it. 

**Edit: Somehow, I forgot the energy drain on the wight, which would totally screw over a party of lvl 1 players. I am sold on having to change that one.

It is fun and we're starting to get a returning cast of characters, but every week we've had new faces too.

And I've got a group, neigh, a small army that is different than most groups I've run in a while, but vastly amusing. The game is an open one where people can come and sit in for a week (or longer) if there is room at the table. Last week we had a huge party, and this week we had a group of 8. 1/2 warrior types and 1/2 rouge types.

I had to share tonight's story, because it made this GM laugh:

Tonight the group was lamenting at the start of the game the fact that they've gone almost two sessions and they have not gotten into any fights. (They had the opportunity last week for at least two and turned down the chance.) They were doing some exploring under the city and had found what they were looking for, and were thinking of heading back.

Then they heard a hiss, thump, hiss, thump. Rhythmically, and organic. 

They decided to investigate.

They find an area that is under part of the city, and they see the telltale glow of a fire in the distance. One of the group sneaks forward, trying to be cautious and quiet like. He's followed after a few moments by another sneaky type in the group.

The rest of the group positions themselves in a defensive area and takes up areas under cover and try to get ready to handle anything that may be coming their way.

Everything is going to plan. The sneakers need to see how well they're doing.

Player 1. Roll... Critical success! He has blended with the shadows and has gotten a much better view of what is going on.

Player 2. Roll... Critical failure! He has clattered over something on the ground, and it echoes down the tunnel.

The rhythmic hiss thump hiss thump comes to an abrupt end. 

A group of lizards walking upright come to see what is making all the noise nearby. The first player sees the lizards in the distance and does a quick count, at least 20 dancing around a bonfire. He steps out in front of them from the shadows.  (He assumed it was he that was discovered. ""I've been sent to see what you are doing, and to guide you."" 

The lizard stops and puzzles over this, then asks if he was sent by ""the Lady"", ""the Dragon"".

""Ummm.... .... .... YES!""

Lizard then asks ""So you have the markings?!?"" 

""Umm... ... ... yes.""

The lizard turns around to reveal in the torchlight a black tattoo of crude wings on its back.

""You, same, show"".

The player looks at me, a bit desperate. ""I carefully pull my sword on the back and cut my back, and then put it back if I can, and if I can't I drop it.""

GM - Um, ok. Roll damage.

Player ""I've been punished, hurt, for following the Lady. I still bleed from my last punishment, I came to find you, those who believe.""

After another ten minutes of back and forth, a good bluff check, and some roleplaying to back it up, he now wants to come back visiting the Lizardmen and ask for some totem they've acquired. He will bring back ""proof"" to vouch for what he says.

But first, he just needs to *touch up* his tattoos, and make the ""punishment"" believable. So he asks for another party member to literally whip his character to make it believable that he was punished for his beliefs. 

Another character has taken the whip as one of his primary weapons, hears this and gleefully rubs his hands from across the table. The sneaky type comes up to him and asks if he could please be whipped.

""Ok""

*The Staff of Churning Water is a four foot long staff made up of gnarled wood, and a clear orb with white waters rushing visibly inside at it's peak, held to the staff by four branches of wood that embrace the magic orb. The wielder can use the magical waters of the staff as a weapon to push back enemies or envelop them in a cloud of fog. The waters of the staff regenerate about 1/3rd of the staff's capacity per day.*

Spells that are casted using the staff:

**Hydraulic Push (1/3rd of the staff's water):**


CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
EFFECT

Range close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)
Targets one creature or object
Duration instantaneous
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance yes
	
DESCRIPTION

You call forth a quick blast of water that knocks over and soaks one creature or square. You can use this blast of water to make a bull rush against any one creature or object. Your CMB for this bull rush is equal to your caster level plus your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier, whichever is highest. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Hydraulic push extinguishes any normal fires on a creature, object, or in a single 5-foot square which it is targeted against. Magical fires are unaffected. 

**Fog Cloud (Uses all of staff's water):**

CASTING

Casting Time 1 standard action
Components V, S
EFFECT

Range medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. level)
Effect fog spreads in 20-ft. radius
Duration 10 min./level
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The spell does not function underwater.

**I'm also not sure what to give my druid. Any suggestions? He doesn't really use melee combat, relying mostly on spells and his animal companion.**

Then we get to the childhood conflict. The conflict? Seduced someone into doing something that might not be in their best interest. The target? A family member. The reason? Love. Suddenly that minor offense is starting to look like incest. Current relationships? Has a lover, and the love drawback.

So what I have in my game is a group of standard D&amp;D 3.5 edition races, playing D&amp;D 3.5 edition classes, with the usual D&amp;D 3.5 feats &amp; spells.  For the most part, I can abide this.  I don't want to be like, ""I force you to try new things!""

However, there is one thing that really bugged me.  They all, without exception, started looking up the Pathfinder prestige classes, building characters toward those classes... basically the old D&amp;D 3.5 way.  Not *one* of them gave serious consideration to archetypes.  Some of them, even after hearing me repeatedly mention it, didn't even bother to look it up.  So basically, some of them *don't even know what an archetype is* despite being urged to investigate how it might help them.

And that's the one thing that's blowing my mind.  So, I'm asking for your help.  They have 3 sessions to settle into their characters (meaning, they can revise anything at all for the first 3 sessions).  So I have 3 games in which to show them the power/coolness of archetypes.  I have to throw an NPC or two or three at the party, with some kind of archetype that flips expectations on its head.

I want them to fight a druid and have the druid do something so un-druid-ish that they all sit there perplexed.  I want them to fight a fighter who is completely unlike their pre-conceived notions of what a fighter is.  I want them to battle a wizard who is a level lower than they are, yet somehow has weird powers that give him/her an advantage they never saw coming.

What do you have for me?  What archetype is mind-blowing?  Even if it wouldn't be good for a normal PC, that's fine.  It just needs to be good enough to visually break their brains.  It can't fit in the D&amp;D 3.5 mold.  Help me out!  Let's make them *envy* archetypes.  Let's make them rejoice when they learn that they too can try archetypes.

Party/group/campaign starts at *fourth* level.

**Edit:** Oh my gosh, you guys are magnificent!  So far I'm looking into a barbarian Titan Mauler and bard Sound Striker.  I'll probably try 1 or 2 others, still trying to figure out what other archetypes would be spectacular.  Thanks so much!  This is great!

I've been reading the PFS info on the paizo site, but I am not sure if I raelly understand the difference between Pathfinder Society vs. regular plain old Pathfinder.  My understanding is that Pathfinder Society has a more standardized set of rules (e.g. standardized point system for character creation, no House rules, etc.  It also seemed like in a PFS game, you might not be doing a full on campaign with the same people everytime, but you could essentially just show up with your character and your Pathfinder Society # and you’d be able to get a game.

I recently have started running a new Pathfinder game after taking a break from tabletop gaming for a few year, but decided to get back into it when I had a large group of interested newbies to tabletop. I am still trying to readjust, and playing in pathfinder instead of 3.5 might be making it a bit more difficult.

Basically I was curious about house rules that people might enjoy using to either expedite or improve their games at home? 



So far the main one's I am including is stealing the minion rule from 4th ed, as well as running with an idea based off of residuim from 4th ed (allowing players to break down the magical properties of magical items in order to get half of its value in a magic dust they can use for item creation, or as currency in some locations.)

1370991364.0,22,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1g5n7k,My first time as pathfinder GM.,Kevin1993awesome,29,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1g5n7k/my_first_time_as_pathfinder_gm/,"So i had my second game of being the GM, the good thing was improvising for a short period worked. When the game started i quickly got all of them to understand how skills worked and how to do problem-solving. 

The second game i read many of the rules, invited people and i had time to prepare. My laziness decided i wanted to run a pre-made dungeon narrative. I didn't expect that i would get 5 people to be DM for. I expected more people to say they couldn't come. So i had to make 2 custom classes so we didn't have to have more then one of each class.

 I had the beginner box so i had to read on the internet and the worst part was that the people having those classes wanted them to be made the day the game was going to be instead of the day before. If you got 5 people, prepare well and drop the beginners box and get a core book, unless your a total noob you wont need it anyway, besides the beginners box character creation was just confusing. 


As i read the rules, looked at the classes, advice the players and tried to generally get the thing started i was mentally taxed before the game even started and i felt like shit. I tried to explain how on paper rpgs work to those new to the game, its goal, but got constantly interrupted. I hate this. 

They went from people who only seemed vaguely interested and who were difficult to include to being dead serious on the rules of the game. Which means they completely missed my attempts at explaining how being strict on rules mostly ruins the games, especially if you don't even know them. 


Suddenly while i was trying to lead the game they claimed to know the rules better then me, not even knowing that half the shit a GM does is to improvise. When a player decides to climb on a monolith there is nowhere in the book you can find any rule on what acrobatics DC you need to climb it. I make shit up, and i forget some rules, but at my first game i choose to ignore it so that we don't have to spend our whole game reading the whole book. i felt like explaining more aspects of the game was more important. 

Improvising worked, but i fucked up their character sheets and we got a lot of fuss out of things that didn't even matter at their lvl of play. 

One guy (cleric) even decided going alone for a chest ahead of their team was a good idea and got mad when he got consequences for his bad perception and AC skills when the chest turned out to be living. I understand that me being uncertain of myself made people nervous as they didn't really know how to play the game so they tried to focus on the rules. Be prepared or be mercilessly criticized, a bad player is a minimal annoyance, but a bad GM can ruin a whole game. 

In this game i tried to explain how it didn't matter, but once they had formed their opinion they wouldn't hear any of it. This means, if you have a couple of people who are new to this thing, explain carefully and make it a point, that good roleplay makes a great game, not following the rules. The rules can be altered and still be great, some rules can be forgotten and you can choose when to include certain rules. Mention to them, that looking in the book for every little detail ruins the experience more then it enhances it. Also with disagreements, rule discussions and arguing the GM is the one to make the final call. 

This i believe is best as that through a noob adventure you can decide later if having certain equipment will be necessary. It is important to explain this because many people make their characters based on combat style and when you fuzz with the rules it makes them pissed. 

What i also lacked was passion for my game, with unnecessary arguments, confusion and bitterness the game was hard to feel intrigued about. I followed most of the dungeon according to the pre-made campaign and it wasn't good at all. The descriptions sucked and i had no mental picture of the rooms in the game.  I feel like i gave the players a lot of freedom and they even had fun stealing from each other. 

For my next game im thinking id change up the game by introducing characters, more random events, making the world feel real, travel and making each class feel like their role has its uses.

Our party of five was spending a night at the inn. The next morning one of my more expensive items was missing, and I noticed my belongings were out of place. Three of our party was incapacitated, so that rules them out. The fourth - my suspect - was about to go to bed early when he suddenly changed his mind and spent the night allegedly sipping a pint until long after I was asleep. The next morning as we were searching for the item I had lost (with a number of fruitless rolls by myself and the three previously incapacitated members) the suspect offered to look for the item in return for a monetary reward. I agreed, and while the other four of us were searching, he wandered off then came back pretty quickly with my item in hand, claiming to have found it at the bottom of a well. I paid off, item was returned, and on our merry way we went.

For the moment my case is a bit flimsy. I haven't spoken of my suspicions at all, and have casually blamed the incident on unknown NPCs. Either in our next session or the one after I should be able to quietly, but definitively get proof one way or the other. My question is, if the proof points toward the PC how should I handle it? 

My alignment is lawful neutral, he's chaotic neutral. My character's been more about personal morality rather than trying to enforce the law on everyone, however none of the events so far have directly effected me. He has been vacillating between seemingly random acts of goodness and evil. He has, as far as I know, not gone after any PCs so far.While my first instinct was to go old-testament on his ass, I'm thinking that's a poor way to do things.

The first of these items is actually an enhancement that can be put on armor. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shocking Defense
Shocking Defense I Cl(5th) II Cl(10th) III Cl(15th)
Effect: Upon taking damage from a melee weapon this armor or shield property activates causing 1d6(+1 enhancement cost) 2d4(+2 enhancement cost) or 2d6(+3 enhancement cost) to the attacker. A successful fort save halves all damage from attacks this round. The DC save for this is 10+ the caster level of the enhancement, so DC15, DC20, and DC25 however if the weapon being used is solid metal (swords, but not an Axe) the fort save increases by +2. 
Required: Craft magic Armor, Shocking Grasp.
Side Note: I built this enchantment for a duelist I made specifically to wear down a the fighter in the party, she is massively powerful and in play tests this has helped wear down her character slowly enough to be considered balanced by me, so I made it available to my players. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thunder and Lighting 

These twin brass knuckles are made out of Adamantine and Mithral respectively. They add 1d6 Soinc or electric damage on unarmed attacks. Each of the weapons contains 3 charges per 3 days and can be recharged if left out during a thunderstorm.

“Thunder” Taking a standard action you can strike thunder against any hard surface (so sand doesn’t work) to stun creatures in a 15ft burst centered on the wielder. This ability uses 1 charge from Thunder, DC20 fort to not be stunned, success means that the creature is only deafened. 

“Lighting” As a full attack action the wielder may fire out as many ranged touch (max 100ft) attacks as her base attack bonus allows, the first deals 6d6 and subsequent bolts deal 1d6 less. If the target is wearing metal the wielder gets a +4 circumstance bonus to hit. This uses one charge from Lighting. 

“Bring the Boom” as a full round action the wielder can slam Thunder and Lighting together to make a single ranged touch attack using the same circumstance bonus from the “Lighting” ability. It deals 10d6 damage in a line to the target as well as the “Thunder” Effect to both the target and to those on 5ft on either side of the line. This uses 2 charges from both Thunder and Lighting.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fire Tamers Whip

Dmg(S) 1d2+1d6 fire / Dmg(M) 1d3+1d6 fire / x2

This whip once per week may as a standard action allow the use of Control Flames as per the power with a manifester level of 12. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bottled Tornado Cl(18th) 

Description: This small glass bottle has a picture of a crudely drawn tornado with a warning label with instructions on the back. The cork is firmly attached and when pulled off not much happens till the command words are spoken.

Ability(s): Command word: Ability

Trickle: Allows the user to breath out of the bottle for 30 rounds or 3 minuets so long as its held to its mouth.

Steady: Acts as a gust of wind spell for 5 rounds per day, these rounds do not have to be consecutive, but if they are it requires a standard action to hold the bottle steady on the target desired. 

Full Blast: Acts as a gust of wind spell, with one difference, the size of creatures affected moves up by two steps. 

WARNING: No not allow bottle or cork to cause or to be cracked or broken. Doing so will release the small piece of the elemental plain of air to exist in this material plain. (This causes a massive tornado to tear everything apart within thousands of feet, killing most things in moments [my thought was about 10d%+300])

Obviously the character is built around charging around on my Riding Dog and doing massive damage with my lance, so I would like some assistance with that, if the lovely people here could be so obliging.

After a preliminary search I realized that I can't take any of the other charge-based mounted feats yet, as I believe the next one I would use requires 9 ranks in Ride, hence level 9. 

I do seem to recall there being other feats that boost Charging, but I couldn't seem to find them when I looked through the list on the SRD. As it stands right now I may just take Weapon Specialization (Lance) unless I can find something to the contrary.

They have NEVER played D&amp;D before and only one of them has any experience play even video game RPGs.

**PC Classes** are Half Orc Fighter (Town Blacksmith), Halfling Ranger (Local Trapper), and Human Paladin (Local Temple Initiate).

I'm excited about this and I'm an experienced DM, so it's no problem to whip something up for them.

They are mainly familiar with episodic TV shows so I was planning on doing this campaign in a similar style.  The main focus is to have something very simple

-a fairly linear story
-clear lines between good and evil (the bad guys are clearly bad)
-a longer starting session, followed by shorter, episodic style sessions leading up to a finale

**Here's what I have so far:**

All the PCs start as friends in a small logging village on the frontiers of a happy kingdom.  While going about their normal evening routine in the local innhouse a fist fight breaks out.  

Eventually, the Local Temple Head Paladin (older human) arrives and is easily able to put an end to the violence with words.  He's about to leave but stops and turns, picking out someone at the bar that the PCs overlooked earlier.  It's a man in all black studded leather armor, black cloak, wide brimmed hat, and a scarf/sash covering his lower face.  The Temple Head orders him to leave and it almost becomes a fight, but the **BAD GUY** leaves the bar, saying ""Your time is coming, old man.""

That night, while at the blacksmiths house, the PCs are resting and recovering from the barfight.  Noises outside wake them up and an attack on their little village begins!  A goblin or 2 crash through the windows of the house but the PCs should be able to fight them off.

Coming outside, they see a full raid on the town happening.  Goblins, hobgoblins and bugbears lighting buildings on fire and generally running amoke.  The burning/collapsing buildings should serve a a good way to herd the PCs toward the Temple and a few small fights, where they will see the Temple Head trying to protect the other townsfolk trying to get inside for safety.

The Temple Head yells for them to get below into the catacombs and seal the door, ordering them and the Paladin initiate if necessary.  The raiders storm the Temple, with the black garbed leather wearing BAD GUY from the bar leading them.  PCs lead the townsfolk below and seal the door.

Once the sounds of fighting stop, the PCs emerge to find their town destroyed and most of it's people kidnapped.  The Temple Master is laying in the courtyard of the church, his shield and blade broken next to him and a poisoned dagger buried in his stomach.  

He hangs onto life longer enough to tell the PCs that they need to go to the Capitol and warn the King that the Dread Lords have returned and tells them he has a letter confirming this in his quarters he was writing after seeing the **BAD GUY** in the bar.  Then he dies (Que sad music)

The PCs head to his quarters to find someone already picking them over.  This turns out to be an old blind Oracle (NPC) who had visions that something terrible would happen here but that there was still hope to prevent the kingdom from falling.

She joins with the PCs, acting as mentor, knowledge store, and out of combat healer.  Using supplies scavenged from the towns ruins, the PCs head out on the long journey to the capitol, desperately trying to stay ahead of the Dread Lord's Army advancing behind them.

From here, things will move to a shorter episodic style with encounters and stuff like that on the way to the Capitol.

&gt;Casting Time 1 minute

&gt;Components V, S

&gt;Range touch

&gt;Target one willing animal of Medium, Large, or Huge

&gt;Duration 1 day or dismissed (D)

&gt;Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no

&gt;You transform the subject animal into a size category of Small, young version of itself for a period of time.

&gt;Large to Small -8 str +4 Dex -4 con

&gt;Medium to Small -4 str +2 Dex -2 con

&gt;Dismissing the spell early takes 1 minute.

&gt;If insufficient room is available for the creature to return to it’s original size, the creature attains the maximum possible size it can and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it. The spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

He'll be a lv7 Druid, Wolf animal companion (I'm assuming his primary target for the spell)

- 1 Day duration for a Lv 2 spell

- Huge -&gt; Small (or even Large -&gt; Small) with a Lv 2 spell

Previously, it was 1hr/lv duration (which I still felt was too much for a Lv2 spell...not sure how a full day (even with the dismissal restriction) is better). Additionally, being able to drop multiple size categories (even requiring a willing target) seems to be *way* out of scope for that level.

So there is someting I do as a DM a lot and I am not sure if it counts as cheating, if I should stop, or if it is common practice.

I'll explain by using an example. Last session my group fought a witch and her skeleton minions. The Druid hit her with Hail Storm and Call Lightning and the Ranger shot her with Rapid Shot. In two rounds she was already killed...but I wanted her to be memorable, I wanted this to be a hard, tooth-and-nail fight that they barely survive. So, when I saw her HP drop below 0, I casually added 30 more HP to her, doubling her total. They ended up having another 5 rounds of fighting before they took her down, and she hexed half of them, and ""feared"" the barbarian. They will certainly remember her. 

My argument:
I did it to try and make the adventure more memorable, more fun. It's no fun to just down a boss without effort. It might make the Druid feel like a bad-ass for killing her with two of his biggest spells, but everyone else would have been left out.

But was it legit?
Am I alone is doing this?

P.S.

I just saw the « My DM is insane » thread and I was starting to think of my personal homemade rules (or rule interpretations) and as I was ready to conclude that nothing seemed too absurd and that I am not too insane, one thing came into my mind: I never roll a confirmation dice for critical hits. 

When someone rolls a 20 (or a 18/19 with a special weapon), it just does a critical, because critical hits add a random aspect to the game that I find very funny (many laughs or hurrays around the table come from critical hits or failures), and because I don't like the fact that if you roll a critical hit when you did not originally have a great chance of hitting (say, a +5 attack against a 20 AC), you will probably not get your satisfying critical (and that's a shame, especially because you had the balls to try to hit the bad guy even if that was unlikely to succeed).

Of course, it implies forbidding the Critical Focus feat, and all of those who depend on it. And of course, when my bad guys roll critical hits, I don't confirm them either. But I don't forbid feats like Disarming Strike (allows to attempt a Disarm roll on a critical hit) or Improved Critical (double the critical range of a weapon). Should I? Or in other terms, could one of my players create a build which relies on those rule modifications and make an overpowered character?

Edit: Thanks for your answers! It seems that if you're Min/Maxing, then it could give something kind of overpowered, but obvious too - typically, if I see one of my players create an entirely crit-based fighter, I'm gonna have to reevaluate the rules.

I am purely interested in how / if this system would mesh with my *subjective* opinions.

Now, that said, I'm asking from the position of a new DM (although I played a small 3.5 campaign many years ago). About a year ago I got some friends from school involved in a short, messy 4th ed campaign geared on teaching them how to play and me how to DM. I specifically went with 4th ed for this reason, to ease them into tabletop gaming. I also went with this system because the variety of combat abilities for all classes appeals to me.

Now, my questions about Pathfinder are as such (and yes I know you'll likely be biased because this is the Pathfinder subreddit, but I'm prepared for that):
I'll only directly compare the two systems to illustrate my preferences and not to judge which is objectively better.

* Do you find that Pathfinder system gives, particularly melee, characters enough variety / does it push them to think outside of the box enough to compare to magic-based classes? I like the combat actions of 4e, but I find that it is harder as a result to get players to interact with the environment, favoring their wealth of abilities instead.
* I'm interested in heavily customizing a campaign, to the point of creating a number of custom classes, races, and a new setting. I know that the 3.5/Pathfinder system is more customizable, but due to its relative complexity (and while I consider myself competent) how difficult would such an endeavor with this system be for your average, somewhat experienced DM?
* I've always had trouble gauging the progression of game systems in terms of play speed. I always want to get my hands dirty and go with a long-term campaign, but the default XP gain rates seem oddly fast. Am I crazy? On a similar note, do you find that protracted campaigns become drawn out and boring if you're not leveling often? I'm not sure how to effectively balance a satisfyingly long campaign against players becoming powerful too quickly or too slowly. (This is probably my weakest point as a DM)
* This last question is related to the first, somewhat. I am personally a fan of non-linear combat and roleplaying opportunities. Namely, I like mechanics that work toward allowing players to make choices and take heroic actions beyond just a regular attack. I like to challenge them to fight in odd circumstances, like on moving platforms, or across a chasm with a vine bridge stretched across, and I like to enable them to use the environment as a weapon. As a result, rules like grappling and throwing, or acrobatics and swimming are all important to me. I know that these are all a bit more complex in 3.5 / Pf, but do you find that they are suitable for significant use? My concern is that these are all actions with potentially deadly results for the players, and a heavily chance-based system seems like it would discourage a player from being too ambitious.

I have more questions, but those are probably the main considerations I've been trying to make. Also, yes, I know I could get all these answers from doing and spending lots of time with my nose in the Pf rulebook, but I'd also love to hear firsthand opinion - after all, most of you are bound to have way more experience than I!

That said, I will leave it there. Thank you in advance and I apologize if for any reason I've totally misinterpreted something in my post (don't hurt me!)",,False,self,t5_2trms,1364860142.0,,,True,t3_1bh2kc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1bh2kc/considering_pathfinder/,

I am DMing a large party (9 people) of new players, and they are going to encounter something that they cannot beat.  They are currently all level 10, and they are on their way to assist a dwarven kingdom who is under assault by Drow and some shadow-plane natives.  As they delve deeper into enemy territory, they are going to uncover an Ancient Umbral Dragon who is allied with the Drow and bringing in his cult of shadow-plane natives (mostly fetchlings and kobolds, with some dark stalkers/creepers/slayers mixed in).

I am worried that the party is going to think that they need to kill this dragon.  If they try, the majority of them will fail their saves against its frightful presence and the those who pass will probably die to a breath and some castings of finger of death.  No one in the group has played tabletop RPGs before and are all used to console RPGs where the main characters are the most important and powerful people in the world.

Basically my question is whether or not I should tone down the dragon so that it would be possible for them to kill it, but make it difficult; or, leave it as is and try to discourage them through RPing from the dragon itself and based on their knowledge rolls.

Edit:  Thanks for the ideas folks.  I've decided that I'm going to foreshadow something horrible happening to the dwarves in a series of dreams that will come to the divine casters the closer they get to the city.  I've already sent them the first dream:

You have an ominous feeling, but can’t see anything that would cause you to feel like you’re being watched.  As you stand up, you notice your shadow growing longer.  You look around towards the other party members, and see their shadows are growing larger as well.  When you turn back to look at yours, your shadow is starting to stand up off the ground, its hands growing elongated, pointed claws instead of fingers.  You back away and draw your weapon, yelling to the rest of the party to get up, but as you glance around you see the other party members are being attacked in their sleep by similar shadow monsters.  When you focus back on the creature approaching you, it leaps at you – and you startle awake.""

The dreams will get more and more specific about a shadow dragon destroying the dwarves as they progress.

When they get to the city, if they decide to help out the dwarves then they will be traveling with some ranger NPCs who will most likely sacrifice themselves to get the group to run for their lives should they encounter the dragon.

There will be drow leaders that they will uncover and they will be their 'boss fight' for this side-quest.  Killing these leaders will cause the drow to abandon the siege against the city, and the dragon will return to the shadow plane - most likely abandoning his cultists that he brought over.  His forces alone are not enough to defeat the dwarves.  But the party will have made an enemy in an Ancient Umbral Dragon for stopping him from collecting ""his"" treasure, so potential plot hooks for the future.",,False,self,t5_2trms,1362602836.0,,,True,t3_19r786,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/19r786/concerned_about_tpk_because_my_party_doesnt_know/,

1) How does Dex work for an archer? I read that archers need Dex to hit, so does that replace attack for an archer?

2) How does Str work for an archer? Is that still damage?

3) For Rapid Shot the CRB says ""When making a full-attack action"" what is that? Does that mean I have to declare Rapid Shot at the start of my attack?

4) How does Mighty Weapon work? If my STR is 14 then my modifier is +2. Don't I already get +2 to damage? If I get a Mighty weapon then how does that affect my damage with my STR modifier.

Beginning with Waves and moving through Spellcasters, Terrain, Area Conditions, Items and many more, these elements can change a standard heroes fight villains encounter into much more.

From the scout fleeing to get others, to hidden enemies springing forth at inopportune times a Wave can really turn a fight on it's head.  The goblin that appears from behind a wall to flank the fighter, or gank the ""safe"" caster, the kobolds that suddenly rappel from the ceiling, the pack of viscous hounds summoned by the noise of battle.

One of the GM's had this mini-list when warning people not to overpower their characters: gunslingers, bow ranger, magus, summoner, alchemist, etc. 

What do you think goes in the ""etc""? What classes have caused the most problems at your PFS tables? 

I've played a summoner in the above GM's table (non-PFS) so I might be the cause of his discontent with the class (other than the recent ""retirement"") - my eidolon was decidedly not squishy at first level. I imagine it's also a hard class to be certain that the player is playing legally. I'm certain my eidolon was built legally, but it seems to require an intimate knowledge of the rules (and perhaps a mathematics degree) to quickly check the legality of the eidolon build.

Hello,

Purely for fun/interest purposes, I'm conducting a brief poll regarding player alignment preference.  I posted this to the D&amp;D subreddit and it was suggested I crosspost to here.

**The poll is closed, results will be posted in the next few days**

This poll is directed at people who have played as PCs; if you've only ever DMed and never been a PC, it won't apply to you.  Sorry :(

I'd appreciate it if you could take a few seconds to answer the following questions on the poll:

1. Which of these alignments have you played as in the past? (Multiple selections allowed)

2. Which alignment is your PREFERRED alignment to play as? (Pick one)

3. (Optional) Is there any reason you lean towards playing the alignment you selected in Question #2?

4. Are there any alignments which would interest you, that you have not previously played as? (Multiple selections allowed)

I'm going to leave the survey open for at least a week; I'll post the results to the /r/DnD subreddit next Friday (5/24) or Saturday (5/25) for all to see.

Thanks!

Me and a friend of mine have a few gripes with how most combat feels in the few Pathfinder role-playing groups that we participate in. Mainly that it's mostly about dealing damage and that combat maneuvers and other more 'flavourful' combat options are rather inefficient when it comes to getting through combat.


I'm looking for a few ways for a DM to make his players consider other options in combat as viable alternatives to dealing damage. Since I don't think it will be possible to change the intrinsic attitude of some of the players who rather like power-play and dealing damage, I'm especially looking for ideas as a DM.


From what I've experienced so far, if there's one or two players who made their characters to deal a lot of damage, the DM adjusts with more hitpoints on hit monsters, making the more flavourful fighters that don't deal quite as much damage feel rather useless. For example: an 18 strength half-orc two-handed fighter with a greatsword and power attack hitting for 20-30 damage at level 6, versus a 10 strength, 16 dexterity, 16 charisma sword-sword finesse fighter heading towards Performing Combatant and related feats. I'm glad I got to switch Strength and Charisma and that we recently got to repick our feats (due to a houserules update).


Another thing of note is that we like to play at low levels and are using our own variant of Epic 8.

How do you guys go about shopping in your games?


Magic Items -do you use a random generator like a loot generator? Do you use a pregenerated list that way you have it all ahead of time? Do you just make it up on the spot?

Masterwork - always available?

Roleplay - Do you make them roleplay the entire shopping experience?

MY EXPERIENCE:
When it comes to loot I like to use the random generators like on donjon or using combat manager. But for a list of items in stock I'm not sure exactly how to go about it. I realize that all of the options mentioned are viable, I'm more interested in what YOU do in your games.

As for shopping I've simply told players to wait until next session so that I'll be prepared for what is in stock. I then (using the CRB and GM) rolled up a bunch of random items. It took forever! I looked into using random generators but they all seemed to be missing things ie, multiple spells on a single scroll(limit of 3) along with the rarity of having 3 on a single scroll. It seemed like none of the generators mimicked the probabilities of the tables found on the GM book.

Edit:
Wow thanks for the response!

My issue was that most of the players just want to browse what magical items are in stock. Because of that I made the list using the settlement stat block. I found a generator that suits my needs however. http://www.dunknet.net/pathfinder.aspx

Had an amazing time, but wanted to get into a more serious game. Somehow managed to get 3 of my friends interested, picked up RotR and had them over for a character build night that lasted 8 hours of pure nerdiness bliss. Everyone had a great time. We decide to meet up in a week (tonight) and start Rise of the Runelords. My shiny new book comes in the mail, and I start in on the tomb of pure quality.

Reading through this thing is awesome... The lore, the stories, the history built into each character. I'm seriously blown away. I can't wait for my friends to experience this tonight. However I have one concern, that as I move further into this book keeps getting worse.

How in the H3LL am I suppose to keep track of all this information? And how do I get even a 1/3rd of it into my PC's minds? Town lore, magic lore, character history, personal issues, family issues, work places, the list goes on and on... I read an encounter in the book, and its beautifully written. And paints a perfect picture in my mind as to how everything plays out. But delivering that to my PC's? I could think of a hundred examples so far, but let me give you one.

First part of RotR, attack on Sandpoint. About the second encounter some goblins attack the PC's with torches. From the books description it says ""A group of goblins has found the cart full of fuel for the sunset bonfire just south of the festival grounds and has lit it on fire.""

So when my group runs to investigate, or perhaps don't investigate and the goblins run over to fight, how do I relate the info to the players? Since they woudln't really know that if they were in this situation in real life, since it happened outside of their view, how can I give them this rich history (both large scale, and small details like the one I outlined here) without making it un-realistic? 

The amount of quality material here is mind-blowing. I just don't know how to track it all, and present it all to the PC's without just reading word for word from the book. And even then it says things specifically tailored to the GM's eyes, and wouldn't really work just reading aloud to the PCs.

When I'm in an Inn, its giving me all this lore. All this info. Who the shop keeper is, their story, history... Do I just rattle this info out and hope my memory recalls what I have told them and what I haven't?

I'm interested in using one of the Epic X variant rule sets. For those unaware, here is the Epic 6 page for D&amp;D 3.5: [LINK](http://www.myth-weavers.com/wiki/index.php/Epic_6). Basically you stop leveling at 6 (or 8) and gain feats every 5,000 exp after that.

I'm wondering whether I should use E6 or E8. I think E8 would be better for a number of ways:

* Medium warriors (rogues, monks, clerics) would receive +6/+1 BAB.
* Higher level so HPs are higher and they can naturally take on higher level monsters (probably up to CR 15 after 15+ extra feats).
* Casters get access to 4th level spells, which can appease the casters in the group.
* Higher level so isn't as big of a change.
* Access to higher level feats such as Leadership, Improved Critical, etc.

Now you may ask, if you  want higher levels why not make a normal game? Well I want to keep the game world dangerous. With E6 or E8 the lower level enemies can still be a problem with sufficient numbers. Traveling is still a realistic problem (no teleport). And probably best of all, the numbers are kept fairly low. Unless a player is dumping all of their feats into number increasers most rolls will stay at about 30 maximum.

Or is the off-hand notion somehow tied to the character being left/right handed? So that for a character who is right handed, their left hand would always be an off-hand attack, maybe even when the only weapon resides in the left hand?

None of the rules I found really state how it works and most of the characters (NPC Codex, GM Guide etc.) I've seen always describe one of the weapons as main hand and always doing the longer attack sequence with that. While off-hand is always left to the other weapon and there is never a proper long sequence described to those.

I'll start with **the good**: of the six of us, myself (currently witch, but that character is about to die next session, which has been cleared with the group as I only played this for a couple early levels for support to make things smoother), the Goblin Gunslinger, and the Two-Handed Fighter are not a problem. 


I'm going to omit myself from this because as much as I like to think I'm objective in my self-analysis, I'm still likely biased. I intend to ask the group what they think of me in this respect when next I attempt to broach these subjects. 


**The Gunslinger** has a developed character with long-term and short-term goals, doesn't argue extensively when people's actions conflict with his short-term intentions, and just all-around is accomodating while having his own enjoyment.


**The fighter** knows very little about rules and mechanics, but is contributing with light-hearted humor and not getting in peoples way, while still being a part and getting his own enjoyment. Side note: he's a gardener that for some reason went martial, and now uses a two handed shovel and throwing spades as weapons. It's kinda hilarious listening to him describe combat.


On to **the bad: Our Catfolk Ninja** writes some fairly disturbing backstories or goals and doesn't seem to understand why these things would make him evil, and as the group is good or neutral, we would not like him and want to kill him. He's been largely receptive to the way I talk to him about this though, and has been improving bit by bit. The only other issue with him is that he doesn't learn rules easily, and often seems to misinterpret rules in odd ways, which come up in combat and just slow everything to a halt. This is something else I'm working on, as I have a bit of a knack for memorizing rules when I try, so I'm working on expanding my knowledge and establishing with the group that I'm a reliable source of information (and the SRD on a laptop for source helps)


**Our Barbarian** is a barbarian. She gets bored with dialogue, reads a book half the session because what's happening doesn't interest her, and, when she is paying attention, tends to interrupt RP with ""I attack her/him/it."". If we don't want the fight, she threatens us in character (and one time out of character) into either helping or not interfering.


And, **the Ugly: Our DM.** This one gets really frustrating, and I could probably write a whole post just for this, but I'll try and cut out the unimportant points. He’s created his whole world, and is incredibly proud of it. This is good, except he’s prewritten as much as he possibly can, and is very not-flexible when the group tries to pull off some hijinx or something. What this results in, and is the biggest issue I have right now, is that we’re on a railroad that isn’t interesting at all. We’ve been through three or four sessions at least, and have yet to actually want to do any of the quests, because there’s been no form of hook, or NPC’s that we are attached to, or anything of the sort. We’re just running some guy’s errands, and when we try to do something that’s not that, it results in arguing, death (once), and a return to the railroad.


Aside from that, the DM is also changing arbitrary rules and being fairly restrictive in random things that make little sense to the rest of the group, and explains it as not wanting us to try to “break” his world or story, and in this group, none of us are likely to try until he royally pisses us off. In fact, of all of us, the DM is the one who, when he’s a player, is the MOST likely to break a campaign. That’s why we asked him to DM this in the first place, hoping it would be better. 


**TL;DR:**  Barbarian interrupts RP to hit things, Ninja bad at rules and not being evil (though not intentionally), and DM incredibly controlling and hypocritical.

I'm pretty new at GMing, and I ran into an issue the other night and I would like some advice/feedback/suggestions. 

Basically, the beginning of the session relied on my players behaving a certain way, and it didn't work out. I had an NPC that came up to them (he was a well-known local hero) and demanded they right a wrong they had accidentally committed in a previous session. Knowing my players, I figured they would just go with it, but I had a backup in case they wanted to argue. Basically, the NPC was much higher level, and the entire town kinda threatened the players if they decided to try to fight this guy. 

But things didn't go as planned. One of the players invited the NPC outside of the tavern they were in when he started talking to them. Then the other player decided to fight the NPC. Because they were outside, there were few people around to interfere with the fight, and because the NPC was much higher level (and felt very, very strongly about the wrong that was committed previously), I ended up killing one of the player characters. 

Obviously, I didn't mean for this to happen. I kept trying to get the players to back down and just accept their quest, but they felt they had not committed any wrong, and thus felt very strongly against taking this quest. I suppose I could have had the NPC back down, but it didn't seem right, and I just kinda panicked and kept fighting. 

I guess I'm looking for suggestions as to how to effectively prod your players into doing what you want them to do, or dealing with it when they don't. ",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_1g20h1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1g20h1/getting_players_to_do_what_you_want/,

Assuming that the enemy fails the Will save (and I'm playing a Witch - they *shall fail* the Will save), then they accept the offered item and ""use"" it appropriately (putting on rings or armour, drinking potions, eating food, wielding weapons). I just checked with my GM and he agrees that if the target is given a scroll, then assuming that the person *can* cast from the scroll, they will.

[Skinsend](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/skinsend) would make for a great prank (""Ha ha, now you have no skin!"") but it's got a casting time of a full minute, meaning that after the round-long Beguiling Gift effect is over, then the recipient will simply stop casting assuming that they decide ""Actually, I like having my skin on my body, thanks"".

I also, of course, have no way of influencing how the recipient casts the spell. I could give them a scroll of Fireball and they could decide to cast it on my friends - so the best answers are probably going to be spells that give no options in how they are cast.

I'm perfectly aware that once I can be sure that the enemy will fail their Will save, they're essentially dead to the right spell - but Beguiling Gift is still only level one (and therefore can be spent on an enemy without worrying too much about my spells-per-day) and it works well with the style of the character I'm going for.

Edit:  
OK, I've found a couple that are potentially usable. [Fire Sneeze](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/fire-sneeze) states ""Once you cast this spell, you must sneeze each round as a standard action"" which implies that you can't simply dismiss it before its duration is up. It's not likely to last long, but potentially hilarious as long as you move back before you get sneezed on.

If I don't have the benefit of someone *in* my party that can cast the spell, [Dismissal](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dismissal) would logically force the recipient to use it on an available summoned creature of their choice.",,False,self,t5_2trms,1368975877.0,,,True,t3_1emo01,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1emo01/are_there_any_spells_that_can_be_situationally/,

Thus our Initiative order is A, D, B, E, and C. A Full Round is based off of that Initiative roll. After C went the Full Round would be over. At that point you subtract 10 from all of the Initiatives and whomever remains would be able to go again, and in that order. So, A would go a total of three times, D would go twice, and so on.

While I thought of this due to the fact that while some characters are agile on paper, there is nothing that makes the FEEL like they are agile. While this could easily be abused I do not think it is OP in the least as this applies to enemies as well, so it evens out within reason.

The other thought I had is if at the end of that Full Round everyone re-rolls Initiative. I think of it as the possibility of allowing the upper-hand to change during battle.

The problem I am having is that there are so many enchantments that it seems really cheap.

Spectacles of Noticing Things:

The order is Spell level, Caster level, Cost modifier, multiple ability modifier, times per day cost reduction

* Command Word Read Magic = 0.5 x 1 x 1800 = 900
* Command Word Detect Magic = 0.5 x 1 x 1800 x 1.5 = 1350
* Command Word Detect Poison = 0.5 x 1 x 1800 x 1.5 = 1350
* Command Word Detect Undead 2/day = 1 x 1 x 1800 x 1.5 / 2.5 = 1080
* Command Word Detect Secret Doors 2/day = 1 x 1 x 1800 x 1.5 / 2.5 = 1080

Total = 5760gp Cost to make = 2880gp  6 days creation time

I would rule the CL is actually 1 so that makes it nice and easy to make.

Is this right? Seems cheap to me!

Regarding the multiplier for additional effects ... I was considering a house rule that increases the multiplier for additional effects. According to the RAW, if you add a second effect to an item you multiply the cost by 1.5, i was thinking that extending that to make a 2 times multiplier for the third effect, 2.5 for the fourth effect and 3 for a fifth effect.

Or should i simply leave it as is and give the PC his shiny new spectacles?

A few games ago, the party defeated Justice Ironbriar a day after showing up in Magnimar. They were told that they were able to interrogate him in a few days, so no worries. To help pass the time, our NG Cavalier, LG Paladin and our LE Witch run into Ameiko playing in the bar. After a night of drinking with her (while our CN Rogue was trying to rob people), they bring her back to her villa and go back to the inn. Shit happens, faceless stalkers show up and Ameiko is in trouble. They save her and go to bed. When they wake up, she's gone.

And now, they're on their way to the jailhouse to interrogate Ironbriar. That's where everything went to hell. The Rogue decided to go gather supplies to walk back to Sandpoint and the rest of our team went to the jailhouse. Our Paladin loses his mind and sprays Ironbriar with oil, and our Cavalier pulls him out of the room. Then the guards leave. Witch starts to get information, and after everyone comes back into the room, Witch casts a spell to make everyone in a 100+10/caster level area start to think everything around them is a hellish place, everyone looks like demons, etc.

Our Paladin stabs our Witch and leaves, only to have a fight with our Cavalier in the streets in front of the jailhouse. While they fight, our Rogue makes his way to the jailhouse and gets the answers to two of his questions, then leaves for Sandpoint. Our Witch, after getting a little more information, casts lightning on him and sets the oil on him ablaze. Then he runs into the streets, burning and bleeding and screaming before he dies in the street. Paladin leaves to go back to Osirion, and our Cavalier has a rough talk with our Witch, then leaves to go back home to Vigil.

What I didn't expect is for that little barely-mentioned NPC to become a beloved memeber of the party, joining them in their struggles, forming fond friendships with the group (especially the CG Tengu Oracle of Fire, and even earning some affection from the normally irritable and uncaring NE Chelaxian Ranger/Rogue). I run this campaign over Teamspeak (with IM programs to private-chat to party members when necessary), and having private little telepathic side-conversations between Majenko and various party members whilst simultaneously conducting the ""main event"", so to speak, over voicecomms has been an absolute joy.

Over time, the Tengu Oracle has been imbuing him with tattoo magics to empower him (he can breath fire at will (""I'm a real dragon now!""), has increased stats, and some fairly hefty protection... which is needed, considering his hitpoints are worryingly low even after I applied the Advanced Template to him when the party hit 10). He even has his own little stockpile of treasure set aside for him to roll around in as his own private dragon hoard!

Here is what I have:



There is a nation in a high-fantasy world that was once at peace. But very recently...24 hours before the campaign starts- all of the dynasty was almost simultaneously assassinated. This plunged the nation into a state of war, because now all the lords of the land are fighting for power and control of the now shattered nation. nobody really knows how the dynasty was taken out, and anyone that tries and mention assassin's find themselves foaming at the mouth before their sentence finishes. So the PC's find themselves at the very south of the nation, in the weakest Provence that is focused on trade. The lord of the area is close to death, and in his later years, has become peaceful. So he assigns the PC's a task upon their meeting of him. 



He has an ambassador with a plan. The plan is that the PC's escort the ambassador to collect all the pieces of a shattered sword that is legend to have been used by the emperor that turned the scattered provinces into a nation. The sword is legend to have a great power: anytime it was revealed, the people would rally behind it and join the war effort of the great general, and his dragon. But upon the General and his dragon's death, the sword shattered. and each piece was given to a ruling lord of each and every sector of the nation.



So the ambassador wants to go to each and every warring state. collect the piece of the sword. find a way to reforge it, and unite the nation.



But what the PC's don't know is, the ambassador is actually a demon, who wants to remake the sword, summon the dead general and his dragon. so he can use them to enslave the land.

The party, through popular vote, [has now been assembled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQzwL73XcHg), and I am now looking to assemble a party outside of the fantasy world.  I am looking for voice actors, artists and writers to bring these characters to life in a very unique and exciting way.  I believe this project has a great potential to be both very entertaining and to draw more people to our hobby.

If you have any of these skills please consider auditioning.

Most recently, our goblin companion was bold and decided to sneak off on his own and engaged combat with at least 4 enemies on his own, one of which being a wizard that blinded him.

The problem is that, no one had a copy of their own hero handbook, and no one could memorize all the feats they chose and the spells they used etc...

There was confusion about attack bonuses and initiative when outside of an encounter, and everyone was really not caring about the entire roleplaying side of the game. It was a giant mess.

[Vital Strike](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/vital-strike-combat---final), [Improved Vital Strike](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-vital-strike-combat---final), [Greater Vital Strike](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/greater-vital-strike-combat---final): Less Attacks, more weapon damage

[Focused Shot](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/focused-shot-combat): Add INT to damage for one shot  
[Deadly Aim](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deadly-aim-combat): ranged power attack  
[Bullseye Shot](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/bullseye-shot-combat): spend a move to gain +4 attack  
[Desperate Battler](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/desperate-battler): +1 to attack/damage while allies are further than 10ft.

Precise Shot: ignore penalty to shoot into melee  
Improved Precise Shot: ignore concealment and cover penalties

Weapon Specialization &amp; Greater Weapon Specialization: +2 damage each

Still, I'd like to hear from people if they feel this is too exploity, and why/how.

So, I felt that at low levels, Summon Nature's Ally was fairly useless.  The creatures a druid -- who should be premier at summoning critters -- can summon are pretty weak.  Compared to what a cleric can summon, sometimes the druid's animals are slightly better suited for a fight, but then when you apply the celestial/infernal template to the cleric's summons (which you're supposed to do) they often get way better than what the druid can do.  This seems stupid, so I started looking for better ways that a druid can get animals.

I found this set of spells that basically gives me a summoned animal for *hours.*  First, use Survival or whatever the DM suggests to get an idea of the local creatures.  When you find a compatible animal, cast Call Animal to bring it (or a member of that group) to you.  It will sit near you, waiting.  Next, cast Charm Animal, which lasts an hour per level.  Finally, cast Speak With Animals, and run through a few commands that will be useful after Speak With Animals fades.

Now you have a summoned animal which is, I've found, slightly stronger than what Summon Nature's Ally can provide, and it lasts an hour/level instead of round/level.  Due to the Speak With Animals spell, you may have it able to handle a rudimentary command or two, and due to Charm Animal it may not require you to do Handle Animal checks.

Of course, at level 1, my druid could only cast 2 spells.  So, I had to spend a small bit of my starting cash to get a scroll of Speak With Animals.  I was only able to do my trick once, and then had to wait until I came into money.

However, my character is now 2nd level, and I've pulled this off 3 times total.  Each time, the DM gave me a thrylacine (??? not sure if I wrote that correctly, but it's a dog-like animal featured in the Kingmaker campaign), and allowed it to have 2 commands (""attack this"" and ""come to me"").  It would aid me &amp; my animal companion without complaint, and usually made it through an entire mini-dungeon (such as the mite cave system).  I tried to leave each animal in a good state (fully healed or nearly so) and the DM never had them attack me when the Charm spell wore off.

What do you think?  Is it too overpowered to allow that?  Or does the heavy spell investment offset it?",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_169nf5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/169nf5/is_my_druid_cheating_or_unfairly_avoiding_summon/,

Looking for some help/input with a specific build. One of my co-workers has expressed interest in joining my game and after discussing it with the group I told him that it was cool to join. He seems to have his heart set on creating a Halfling Barbarian that does not use weapons in combat. His backstory involves something along the lines of being abandoned as a baby, being raised by wolves and then being reintroduced into society. He says his character will not be able to speak common and I told him that he would have a bonus to handle animal if he can stay in character.

Anywho...like I said he doesnt want to use weapons, just claw/bite/punch etc.

His stats are as follows (11th level Barb): 16 STR | 20 DEX | 15 Con | 10 INT | 10 WIS | 10 Char

I spoke with him and he decided to pick up the Beast totems giving him a claw attack and bite attack while raging. Purchasing two Rings of Rat Fangs would give him 2 additional bite attacks (along with making him look fairly rat-like). He also purchased a +2 Amulet of Mighty Fists.

As for feats he went with:

* Belier's Bite (1d4 Bleeding Damage when hitting an enemy with an unarmed attack)
* Eldritch Claws (Natural Weapons are considered magical and silver for overcoming DR)
* Improved Natural Attack (Bite)
* Improved Unarmed Strike
* Multiattack 
* Rending Claws (If you hit a creature twice with a claw attack, the second attack does an additional 1d6 points of damage).

A full round of attacks (very easy to do with pounce) will do the following:

* 1d2+9+1d4 Bleeding Damage, 3 times (Unarmed Strike)
* 1d6+6, 2 times (Claws x2-From Beast Totem) + an additional 1d6 if both claws hit
* 1d3+6, 2 times (Ring of Rat Fangs)
* 1d4+6 (Bite-Animal Fury Rage Power)

At his current level (11) he will put out a maximum of 91 Damage and up to 4 Bleeding damage applied to the target. Is there anything I am missing, anything he should look at picking up or changing?

I ended up with a handmaiden from the castle, and an orphan girl.

I want some ideas on how to approach this. I'm Lawful Evil, going for the long-term goal of regaining a lot of my power. So if I have to be ""good"" now to reach my goals later, so be it. Sacrifices must be made, etc.

I started trying to come up with a system that basically utilized a Craft(money) roll. every time he wanted to make money he would make 100 gold as a set amount, and he could continue trying to make more with each subsequent roll gaining a penalty.

Now there is no way to ""fail"" this check, he always makes his 100 gold but depending on his initial craft roll he'd gain a bonus or a penalty that use the sa,e rules as ability score modifiers. Where a 14 or 15 would incur a modifier of +2 or a 2 or 3 would gain a -4.

This roll for crafting would be made and recorded by the DM. Then when the player wanted to use his counterfeit money, he'd have to be explicit about it when buying things. and this is where the bonus comes in. in order to use the money he would need to roll a sleight of hand check using his skill in it and gaining the bonus (or penalty) from his fake money against the NPCs perception. If the NPC notices the forgery the player can then make a bluff check using the bonus, or penalty, incurred by the money to try and prove it's purity.

Todays topic:

* Are worlds such as Golarion ment to be explored with in single campaign, or is it merely there to establish different kind of settings for multiple campaigns?
* Would it be better as a DM to focus campaign into Varisia for example and use other areas in later campaigns, or would it be doable to have PCs travel to new area every few levels?
* If you've done campaigns in ""world scale"", what have been the triggers to have PCs travel around?

I guess this all pools (does that make sense in english?) from my lack of understanding on game world time compared to PC level advancement. If a level = year, then obviously travelling makes sense, but if 20 levels = month, then I guess staying in one region is more likely.

The monster had no fixed health total, and died whenever it seemed appropriate. Now I've been in runs where DM's have done this, and admittedly I've done it myself when my players make a choice I never anticipated. 

I've also made up my own magic effects and items, and been in runs where DMs do the same. Sometimes it works, sometimes it feels awkward and forced. 

That being said, as a player I really don't like it. I enjoy roleplaying, I enjoy the story, I enjoy advancing my character, but most of all I enjoy being challenged. When my character survives a fierce battle, or achieves something, I enjoy knowing that there was a chance I might have failed. The possibility I might fail makes the successes meaningful. As a long time DM, its really obvious to me when a monsters stats don't follow the traditional rules. While most players can't spot it as easily, given enough time they often do. Knowing that the outcome of a fight was decided based on a whim takes a lot of the fun out of it. As for magic effects and items, knowing that some of their properties were made up on the spot or without much thought has similar effects.

I'm no stranger to rule 0, but I'm not trying to ask, ""what can a DM do?"" so much as, ""What should a DM do?"". I'm mostly curious about the player perspective on this issue, but hearing how often other DM's do this, and what their thoughts on it are would be valuable as well.

**Edit: Since it wasn't clear in the original post, my issue is not with a DM improvising a monsters stats right before a battle. I understand that as a DM you just can't have stats for every possible encounter your players might ever have. The thing I really take issue with is when they create those values as needed (during the fight), or assigning values that don't follow the general ""physics of pathfinder."" That being that a monster's health, attack bonuses, and saves are derived from its hit dice and statistics.**",,False,self,t5_2trms,1369341438.0,,,True,t3_1evqm5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1evqm5/how_much_do_you_value_the_rules/,
1369183353.0,18,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1esvyu,Phantom Steed - when is a horse not a horse?,CMEast,19,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1esvyu/phantom_steed_when_is_a_horse_not_a_horse/,"Hey all! This came up around our gaming table recently and a few of us had different assumptions as to how the spell works. I'm confident (95% /*shrug*) that my analysis is correct but feedback is very welcome as we can all roll a 1 from time to time. I've included the relevant text below, skipping actual abilities as they're pretty obvious I think. 

&gt; [**Phantom Steed**](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/phantomSteed.html#_phantom-steed)  
&gt; School: conjuration (creation)  
&gt; Casting Time: 10 minutes  
&gt; Range: 0 ft.  
&gt; Effect: one quasi-real, horse-like creature  
&gt; Duration: 1 hour/level (D)  
&gt; Saving Throw: none; Spell Resistance: no  

&gt; You conjure a Large, quasi-real, horse-like creature (the exact coloration can be customized as you wish). It can be ridden only by you or by the one person for whom you specifically created the mount. A phantom steed has a black head and body, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.  

&gt; The mount is AC 18 (-1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) and 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.  

My view - Sooo it's not a creature, it's a creation like [Unseen Servant](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/unseenServant.html#_unseen-servant) only it acts as a horse. It's got hit points but no saves or stats (though it has a dex bonus of +5 which would imply a Dex of 20). I assume that if it gets hit by a fireball then it will automatically take full damage as it doesn't have a reflex save, just like an Unseen Servant. Presumably it isn't clever or motivated enough to dodge even though it does have a dex bonus to it's AC - maybe because it's insubstantial so it doesn't dodge but it's hard to hit? Or would you give it a reflex save based on the rider so if the rider succeeds then it succeeds too? Also, is it affected by spells such as [Stinking Cloud](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/stinkingCloud.html#_stinking-cloud) and [Cloudkill](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/cloudkill.html#_cloudkill)? I would assume it's the same as an unseen servant in these cases and say no.  

More importantly I think, can it hustle and run? If it can run at x4 then that's 400ft a round that you could move. Even more worrying is that if it's not actually a creature then there is no reason why it would suffer fatigue and so overland travel could potentially be much faster, running (if my maths is right) 320 miles in 8 hours compared to a normal horse which can only do 40 miles in 8 hours if unburdened.  

On the other hand, if it can't run or hustle then when you get the spell it can only travel at 40ft a round and never faster. For overland travel it works out at the same speed as a pony and from 10th level onwards you could do 80 miles in 8 hours, still twice as fast as a horse. However if you get ambushed then while everyone else has urged their mounts into a run you're still trundling behind at, at best, half the speed of a running horse.  

So I would say that the movement speed is it's flat walking speed and that it can't be made to hustle or run; even though it is horse-*like* it is still not a horse.  

I think my analysis is accurate but I'd love to hear your thoughts; I think a lot of people overlook this spell which means that there is a danger people might mis-read or mis-use it.

Last night during my RotRL campaign we ran into quite an interesting situation. An argument broke out between 2 PCs; a bard and a rogue. After a heated exchange the bard used charm person. A 3rd alchemist PC was standing between the two and tried to grab the bard's arm to prevent the spell from going off but was unsuccessful and the spell hit the rogue as he failed the save.  

This was a great bit of role play but I have some concerns about the effects. Immediately after the spell hitting the rogue PC became very friendly with the bard, discussing the bar they were in and ignoring the fact that they were just in a verbal turned physical fight. The bard wanted to go investigate the smuggler tunnel under and had no trouble convincing the rogue to join in (the rogue was originally not fond of the idea).  

The way we played out that encounter,  charm person seemed to have negated the entire previous argument and made the rogue entirely agreeable. The bard did not threaten the rogue or do anything to break the spell according to the rules (from what I can tell).  What will happen when the spell wears off in a few hours? The rogue is aware of what he is doing, heis just more agreeable when under charm person correct? So when the spell ends the rogue will undoubtedly be really upset with the bard,  assuming nothing happens to break the spell early?

His parents were adventurers and when they were together they were fighting against a a scourge of demons. The parents were soon captured before the child was born, but because of some divine intervention their baby was saved and brought to a church for the divine's god. He was then raised at the church not knowing anything about his parents but showing promise towards the divine powers. However, in his teen years the abyssal powers of the arcane started to manifest (from his parents exposure to the demons) and his psyche is left torn between his upbringing in the church and his demonic nature.

Obviously the sorcerer side is the abyssal bloodline, but I'm having trouble determining if cleric would work best for a multiclass. Also, besides the major differences what are the inherent disadvantages to multiclassing these two? Is there a prestige class that will work with these two classes? I guess the character's favored class would be the cleric as he'd be fighting against his demonic nature.

edit: This has also renewed my want to play John Constantine as a Mystic Theurge (however broken they might be) with some really kickass artifacts and magic items. But I'm going for more of a nature vs. nurture thing with this idea. On one hand, his arcane powers are coming from the abyssal, and on the other he's spent his life so far praying to the divine and studying to help people.

When it's my turn to DM, I always limit my players in weird ways.  ""Oh, you're from this city, so you can only play one of these five races.""  ""Oh, your a ship crew, so we need a Pilot, a captain, an engineer and some muscle""  Stuff like that.

My newest plan for limiting is to build characters as we go along.  So, for the first 3 or 4 sessions their characters would start off with 10s in all their ability scores (adjusted by racial), and zeros in skills.  Over the course of the first 3-ish sessions there would be a typical adventure (but with very low DCs).  Then as they go along, there would be rewards of ability or skill points for successful challenges.  If they make up some story from their past that would help them accomplish this task, then they get a modifier to complete it.

Let me explain:  ""You figured out a way around this issue cleverly and something that I hadn't planned for.  You spent time making sure that the details were worked out, therefore you get 1 intelligence point!""

And, DM: ""You are trying to move this boulder, it's very large.  If you succeed your roll, you gain 1 strength.  If you fail, you lose 1 strength.""  PC: ""But when I was a kid in the mines they worked me extra hard, so I'm used to moving these kinds of boulders.""  GM: ""Okay, you get a +2 on your roll."" 

There would also be skill checks.  You rode the shit out of that horse with that roll.  Gain +1 Ride.

etc.

Now, I know what you're thinking.  THIS TAKES AWAY MY FREEDOM!!! THE GM IS CREATING MY CHARACTER FOR ME!

But the idea is that there are lots of different tasks, so you can chose which tasks you attempt, and depending on how you attempt it you'll gain different points.  My hope is that this happens while building a character that's much closer to the way you'll actually play them, rather than dumping a stat and using it anyway.  AND developing a back-story as you go along, so that it's got all these little details and memories that come into play, rather than the generic, ""I was orphaned and went looking for adventure.""

After 3 sessions or so, once Ability scores are filled out nicely, they would chose a class, get their class skills, spells, etc. and be ready to continue the story as level 1s (or possibly level 2s).

What do you all think?  Could it work?  What are the pitfalls I'm not seeing?",,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,t3_1di3dq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1di3dq/i_want_to_try_something_new_with_character/,

For those of you unaware, my site (http://www.archivesofnethys.com) is a massive database collecting all of the Feats, Spells, Monsters, Traits, and other juicy mechanics from any official Paizo material. This includes all books released within the Adventure Path, Campaign Setting, Module, Player Companion, and RPG lines. It is similar to the other 3rd-party site (d20pfsrd), with a couple differences. I only enter Paizo material, no 3rd party, in an effort to keep things less cluttered and easy to access. Additionally, I make an effort to tag any PFS-Legal material with the Glyph of the Open Road, for those of you who play Pathfinder Society.

If this sort of thing isn't desired for the subreddit, just let me know and I'll cease making any kind of monthly (or other) announcements here. :)

This month (just copying from my Paizo announcement):

----------------------------------------------------------------

The new releases from April have been uploaded to the Archives. All new material currently marked as PFS Illegal until ""Additional Resouces"" on Paizo are updated with the new books (except for Ultimate Equipment, which has the correct information).

Speaking of which, Ultimate Equipment is finally complete! That massive book is all in the Archives and ready to be viewed.

Lastly, the site has undergone a much needed facelift! Please let me know what you think about the new design, whether good or ill.

Enjoy!

For my regular game that I host, currently at level 4, I am going to have them play out a historical flash-back, using pregenerated characters.  

I want them to play out a short dungeon ending in a final fight with the ultimate BBEG of ages, at which point they 5 sacrifice themselves to trap it.  It'll give them some experience at end-level play, allow them a chance to play a different class, and I think will be really fun for them.

Gnome Rogue (Charlatan) 1/Cleric (Erastil) 1
Domains: Community, Travel(Trade)(GM approval)
Brigand Trait

High CHA and WIS, he's turning out to be quite the perfect liaison with the bandits.

Started a garden at Oleg's. 

Backstory: 

“Smooth trade, even hands.” He said the quick prayer to Erastil before almost every transaction, especially when he was fencing illicit goods. The irony was lost on him for years. How could he pray for a fair deal when he had procured the goods by threat of force? It was just another stone on the scales of guilt plaguing his mind and spirit. He seldom thought the gods would ever forgive him his sins. 

But Merilee holds out hope that the gods will weigh his deeds justly, if only he can do enough good in the second act of his life. 

Born Merristor Boffin Leelik (at least those are the given names that stuck), Merrilee was a happy-go-lucky youth with a strong family and a strong community. His clan was a rustic yet learned pack of gnomes in a secluded area of the Boarwood in Galt. They maintained their connection to the fey First World here, believing it was a source of spiritual comfort and guidance. Despite the harshness of the surrounding wilderness, the thirty-some families managed to thrive for centuries out of fierce devotion to defense, enlightenment, and each other. 
Bored with learning, he excelled in extracurricular activities such as conning the matrons out of extra sweets. As his marks at the community school declined, his parents put pressure on him to work hard, lest he be sent to apprentice at his uncle’s cobbling enterprise in Edme. Sure enough, his parents’ threats proved true. Edme was a colorless place, with less spirit than he thought a place could have. Shoe making was less interesting than even his studies had been, but his uncle allowed him free reign. Seeking some form of excitement, Merrilee soon found his skills of extortion to be most profitable when unfettered by parental scorn. He was making more money with his new friends via illegal means than he could ever make as a cobbler. It was a quick, slippery slope. He moved out, sleeping in robber’s camps and living in community with brigands and highwaymen. These camps were filled with dancing, song, drink, and wild women. Despite their vile trade, these folks appeared to have more spirit in them than the lawful Edme populace. 

Merrilee never could intimidate even a copper from someone, and desperately wanted to fit in with his new friends. He started excelling in their eyes as their go-between with the legitimate world. He could negotiate better prices and built strong relationships with fences in Edme. Occasionally, he could outright trick travelers on the main road into handing over their goods without even the threat of violence. 

One twilight, however, their mark turned out to be bait. They were becoming so good at their trade, word of their exploits had caught the ear of Galtan national advisors. Wanting to make an example, an inquisitor set up an ambush. As they stopped the wagon, it burst open with a score of swordsmen—nearly triple his accompaniment. His friend fled, but his short legs couldn’t make flight fast enough. He was the sole prisoner, and the inquisitor was determined to make him pay for the sins of the whole group.

He lost count of the days he served in The Monolith in Isarn. It was easily months, but he couldn’t keep count as they kept shifting his holding cell, his meal times, and his waking hours to torture his mind. He was certain he had now found a place even more sullen than the dirty streets of Edme. Songs were forbidden. His only solace was whispered humming of his mother’s old lullabies. He met a human man by the name of Yacques who had no fingers. Nearing his death by malnutrition, the man shared his story. He played lute in a troupe of performers who joked and sang about political oppression in Galt. Once they started changing the minds of the people, they were all maimed so they could never ply their craft again. One thing Yacques said stuck with him: “Promise me one thing, boy. If you ever get out, learn the lute. Play the thing so loud that I can hear you in the afterlife.” Tears streaming down his face, Merrilee swore to Yacques.

It wasn’t long after Yacques’ passing that Pentuk (LG clr 7), an ebony-skinned wandering missionary of Abadar, swept through the Monolith preaching repentance. Broken by all he’d seen, Merrilee was willing to hear any message of hope. He remembers few details from the sermon, but what spoke to him was Abadar’s commitment to civilization, taming the wilderness, and bringing thieves to justice (which in his head meant redemption, not the guillotine). 

Merrilee sought religious guidance, and found it in Erastil. The Bull’s Eye Monastery in Isarn was within earshot of the Monolith. He could hear the chanting and bells before, but didn’t pay any attention until his spiritual hunger awoke. Merrilee convinced the warden that it would be good for the less threatening prisoners to make a weekly trip to the monastery for worship. It was in these weekly meetings he learned of ‘taming the wilderness’ (a term used by the priest for the suppressing of evil desires, but which later would hold new meaning for Merrilee). He was also deeply moved by the sermons on dealing even-handedly with others, which put his feeble, one-line prayer in new perspective. 

After a time, overcrowding in the Monolith meant execution for some of the veteran prisoners. Merrilee convinced the warden that he was no longer a threat to Galt or its people, promising never to mix with brigands again. He regurgitated lines he had heard from the faiths of Abadar and Erastil, making a case that he would be a good addition to the world. The warden bought it, and Merrilee walked out of the Monolith at dawn on a brisk spring day 
with naught but ragged clothing. 

Life was harder outside than Merrilee thought. He had become accustomed to regular meals and directed waking and sleeping hours. He had made bonds of friendship with those inside, from prisoners to guards. He was alone, cold, and hungry. His usual charms failed to work on the citizens of Isarn, as his shaven head and ratty clothes painted him as a prisoner.  Despite their rhetoric, the Erastil monks would not take him in. Desperate, he turned to the only life he knew: thievery. But this time, it was different. Every theft was accompanied by guilt and the understanding that he was not dealing even-handedly with people. Every time he stole a potato to stave off hunger or a blanket to keep from freezing, he secretly donated labor to the owner, either by pulling weeds in their garden or by cleaning their windows under cover of night.  

Despite this, he found no solace. He lacked community. Against his better judgment, he began the long hike back to Edme where he knew people. Merrilee was accepted back into the thieving group easily, because he refused to sell out his companions in questioning. He said he wanted to refrain from all stealing, however, and instead he’d man the camp and offer aid to wounded companions. But the need to belong soon broke his commitments to change. Slowly, he found himself back at his hold habits. First, he started fencing goods again (always with a heavy heart). He used his first profits to buy a lute. He spent his free hours teaching himself the notes and chords, determined to honor his promise to Yacques. Erastil seemed to smile upon his efforts, as he seemed to be able to heal even the grizzliest of wounds. 

Then he started suiting up for jobs. It was all too much. Guilt racked him, but he had nowhere else to go. Still, he determined he would be a force for good. He began healing both friends and victims supernaturally in the fray of a raid. He would talk his allies out of killing victims. He truly thought he could walk the razor’s edge and maybe even turn his pals towards good.

One night, however, they caught an elegant carriage on the highway. The scenario reminded him of the Galtan ambush months (years?) past. He refused to have any part in it, and fled, hiding in the bushes nearby. The passengers put up a fight, and it was bloody. Several of his friends died at the end of a sword; the rest fled. After the rout, the carriage failed to continue its movement down the road. He moved to investigate. His friends were lying there, lifeless. One gasped and twitched, but death was too close for his saving. Inside the carriage, two well-dressed elven swordsmen gushed blood, breathing their final breaths. Their ward sat lifeless: an adolescent elven maiden in the finest dress. So delicate her frame. So undeserved her early death. He stared at her for minutes, thinking how lovely she was. The sound of approaching horses broke him from his trance. He was holding her hands in his, thinking of a life that might have been (for her and for him). Knowing that getting caught again would mean a swift execution, he fled. It wasn’t until he was safely away that he realized he had her lace glove in his hand, ripped free in his rapid flight.

That night, he returned to the camp, aided his wounded brethren, then left after all were sleeping. Never again would he associate with these men. Never again would he allow his own weakness end in harm to innocent people. Erastil, the only truth he knew, would guide his way. He didn’t know his teachings, only what lore he had gleaned from the monastery and campfire tales, but it didn’t matter. Erastil was good and right. Word of new opportunity in the so-called Stolen Lands meant a fresh start in a frontier country, where no one would know his failings. Perhaps, if he toiled on the right path long enough, he would be forgiven of all the evil he allowed happen. But could he ever forgive himself?

I have Power Attack and Raging Vitality.  Usually, I would just go the Cleave route... but my group is already kind of annoyed by the amount of damage I'm doing and I'm happy with it too.

So, my question is: What are some fun feats that go well with a Barbarian build that aren't centered around damage dealing?

This is not my intention, but if you have little patience for fail, you've been warned.

So, I have a lot of trouble with combat in Pathfinder, and have famously for years. I've been in about 4-5 campaigns, and not a single one had a combat-competent or viable character. The most fun I've had was my first campaign when I was an elf druid. I don't know if this was because he went easy on us, or because it was a druid -- I find them a lot less difficult to build and use. I spent many a fight moonwalking into the wall as an earth elemental, or tangling enemies with vines so that our fighter could mash them into a fine paste. Our GM at the time wouldn't reward us with gold too often, but I didn't care because I could turn into a bird and fly around. I was my favourite magic item and the character was bad-ass to boot.

But since then I've played a bard (Ugh. Not ugh that it's a bard, but ugh that it is not useful in combat and I know this going into the situation), a gunslinger, and currently have an inquisitor and rogue. I can't hit the broad side of a barn and combats have just become kind of a joke from my end. The less than polite members of my parties ridicule me for my uselessness, while the polite ones manage to not laugh as I consistently miss over and over again. 9/10 times I am not rolling sneak-attack because first of all, you can't do that if you can't hit, and secondly, I'm very squishy and maneuvering to flank usually puts my life at risk.

It's gotten to the point where I've asked my GM if I can sit combat out, which he would not consent to. Part of this is abysmal dice roles, which I have no idea how to change, and part of it is that we're lower levels, but generally I've come to hate combat in Pathfinder because I see no way to be decent at it, never mind good. For me, it has become a barrier that I always have to navigate around to get to the parts of the game I have any skill at or enjoy. Has anyone ever had a similar situation? Is this a funk that you eventually get over, or is this **supposed** to be a grueling process that isn't fun? Help.

EDIT: OK, after a lengthy discourse, I've come to a few conclusions: Firstly, just because, I'm getting new dice. Probably these GameScience ones that claim to roll truer. Normally I wouldn't be so inclined to believe claims about random accuracy and minor imperfections, but those videos someone posted about egg-shaped dice and low center of gravity on low numbers worries me based on my sub-standard rolling.

Secondly, I'm not playing a class suited to melee combat in many of these cases, so it seems like from what many of you have been saying, I have unrealistic expectations about what my character can do. IE: The fighter is cleaving bad guys left and right. Why can't I do that? It's because he's a fighter and I'm not. I might reroll in the future and see how playing a full BAB class is, but for now I'm going to try and focus on what things can aid my party without me necessarily needing to be a high roller or deal as much damage as out front-line fighters.

But third, a few of you have pointed out that my opinions of the game and what I want out of it seems to be at odds with people in my party. When we talk 'shop' we never talk about what cool ideas or concepts we incorporated into our characters. We talk about what we did to maximize our combat skills, and I'm just not that kind of player. Partially because I'm less interested in combat and partially because I don't have the know-how to min-max or even optimize a character for combat. Not really sure how to deal with this one. I don't have many people I know who play, so the groups are largely the same people, but it's entirely possible that this might just not be a good match for me.

I've recently started DM'ing for a group of friends whom have not played many tabletop RPGs, so their RP experience is somewhat lacking from what I'm used to.

Here's a little background:  
A player of mine has been tricked into signing a contract with a certain devil - Who has been following them (spying on them) and attempting to recruit the party to the devil's side.  

The player was interested in looking over the contract but when touching the scroll (which was barbed with metal spiked designed to trick interested parties into accidentally signing in blood.)  The devil took back the contract (now signed in blood.)  The devil has promised the character that he will have 'power' in trade for 'services rendered' and during his time in contract will not have to kill or harm any friends or loved ones.  

Here's my issue: 
The player has been expecting some sort of reward or boon for his ongoing 'loyalty' (as he calls it)  to the devils but so far but they have given him no plans, no expectations, nothing to do.  So far the player feels trapped and tricked - which is what I want.  The player's character is currently a level 7 rogue only about 1000 XP away from leveling.  Next level he will gain a second attack, and all the d6 sneak attack damage which comes with it which to this player is everything.  However - I will be making the player take a level dip into Diabolist (Book of the damned Vol. 1 - Princes of Darkness).  I will be bending the rules on allowing this prestige class obviously and the player will be saying he is dipping into a sorcerer incase anyone in the party beings asking why he is casting spells.  However just so that I don't completely break his idea for his character for too long - The party will at some point in the near future be going back in time and across planes to kill the same devil that had this player sign the contract - At which point the player will be allowed to keep all items gained and in essence swap any levels gained for Rogue level's as if this little trouble has never actually happened.. 

I feel that looking ahead this is an 'okay' decision for a GM to make a character do - temporarily.  
The player feels wronged as if I am purposely nerfing his character. 

Is there any way that I can convince the player - or character that this is just something temporary without giving him too much player knowledge? I expect this devil's contract to last for 3-5 more sessions or for 1-3 more levels.

1374261963.0,14,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1infq6,Fiasco for Pathfinder. Brainstorming needed!,lyra256,18,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1infq6/fiasco_for_pathfinder_brainstorming_needed/,"Hi All!

I love Fiasco, and I've heard all over the place that building character relationships fiasco style for DnD/Pathfinder works really well. The issue is that Fiasco is so contemporary that it's hard to fit into medieval settings. So I wanted to make a new page or two of fiasco for DnD/PF specifically.  (I was made aware that there are a couple of modules already available.  I think they suck.  If you're interested, [Dragon Slayers](http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/wiki/index.php?title=Dragon_Slayers_Elements) and [Fiasco's own Dungeon Delve](http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/104769/Fiasco-The-Dungeon-Delve?term=Dungeon+Delve).  These aren't right yet ((IMO)).  Some points are too specific, and other points don't add anything fun.)

For those of you who don't know/haven't heard of Fiasco the whole game is based on small time crime gone horribly, horribly wrong. (Think Fargo, Burn After Reading, etc.) How you start the game is by sitting in a circle, and having a notecard between you and whoever is sitting next to you. You then roll to get the following:

Relationship with that person.

First you roll to see if you're romantic with them, friendly with them, coworkers, etc.

The you roll to get the detail. ""Friendship... With Benefits!"" 

""Coworker...Professional Rivals""

Stuff like that.

You roll for motivation the same way. What is driving you?

""Need to get laid"" Need ""to get even""

""Need to get the Truth... About Someone's infidelity""
____________________________________

You get it, right?

So here's what I'm thinking. We make a new couple of pages. I need 36 (or more if this takes off) different relationships for party members; and 36 different Motivations that can drive characters (not super epic, campaign driving motivations, just little side plot kind of motivations).

Reasons why I'm not just using Fiasco's book:

First: sex can make parties awkward in my experience, so I'd like to cut out some of the inter-party sex. It's a big part of fiasco, and I just want to cut it down a little. (Though I think ex-lovers would be hilarious.)

Second: It's very contemporary and not very magical-y. So some good brainstorming will definitely help with that.

I will definitely make this all into a PDF and post it here when it's finished for community use!

*TL;DR:* What are some of the funniest/best inter-PC relationships that have happened in your games?

1374175968.0,17,self.Pathfinder_RPG,1ikvwv,Linking Spells to Character Idea: Oracle of Time,Vrathal,20,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1ikvwv/linking_spells_to_character_idea_oracle_of_time/,"I have recently decided to make a character that is a Samsaran Oracle (of Time).  I haven't decided on a name, yet, so I will refer to him as OT.  His previous - and indeed, only other - incarnation was a reasonably powerful human* wizard who was alive during Aroden's death, and felt that humankind was cheated of its rightful glory.  In a rather vain attempt to fix the problem, he attempted the Test of the Starstone to become the god of time and prophecy (which he felt had been abandoned by Pharasma), in order to set the future back upon the course it was supposed to take.  However, that's all that OT can remember about his past self; he has utterly no memory of the Test itself.  Currently, OT's main goal is to discover his past self's name and explore the world in hopes of reawakening memories of his past self, and perhaps to one day attempt the Test himself.

In any case, OT has been gifted with various ""time"" based powers.  However, where I could certainly use some help is on which spells to select.  I should note that I plan to take the Improved Eldritch Heritage (Arcane) feat to grab New Arcana, which will grant me access to any one wizard / sorcerer spell at levels 11, 13, and 17.  I also am taking the Samsaran racial trait that grants access to four (or at least, that's how many I can take with my stats) divine spells of any class, inquisitor, paladin, and druid included.


So here's my question: What spells should I take to contribute to this character's flavor?  Moreover, how can I ""skin"" different spells to complement the character idea?  For example, re-skinning Cure spells so that rather than healing the character, they simply rewind wounds and injuries.

Thanks in advance!

*Samsarans give birth to human children.  This character's previous persona was born as a human and reborn as his current self.

2) I'm reading conflicting messages on how the Cestus and Brass Knuckles function with a monk's unarmed strike.

3) Speaking of the cestus I thought I saw the listed damage as 1d3, did this change and if so when?

4) When wielding a cestus or brass knuckles it says the language says that you are using unarmed strikes technically. In situations like Domain Strike where you get an ability via your unarmed strikes does a cestus prevent these abilities considering that It's possibly the weapon, not the fist, that's doing the damage?

Is it too crazy to work, or do people really play such ambitious campaigns regularly?**

---

Thanks!

Alright, so I have a dream campaign. I'll be upfront and say that I'm somewhat new to ""serious"" roleplaying--most of my experience has been brief one-off games with friends or kids at a camp I worked for that never went anywhere meaningful. As such, much or all of what I envision might be completely typical and accepted or so egregiously insulting to the average PF/D&amp;D player that it would never fly in a million years.

The basic idea is an entirely original world (initially a single continent approximately the size of North America, with the potential to expand from there depending on events and player choice) with largely original races, several overarching meta-plots that are either regional or temporal (i.e., that is that players could choose to ignore them entirely and they might go on of their own accord, for better or for worse), and a heavy emphasis--whether they follow the plot or not--on exploration of a depopulated world.

Set several decades after a cataclysmic event destroyed an enormous portion of the continent, killed the majority of the military forces of the  major political entitities therein, and massively destabilized the world through a mixture of ""nuclear winter"" type calamity and political upheaval, this campaign focuses on players ""rediscovering the world."" While they do so, they can choose to explore the mysteries of the past--including the reasons for the cataclysm--and the present. They can unseat evil kings (or good ones!), rescue (or damn) peoples on the brink of extinction, stop (or help) power-mad villains, guide a fledgling race into the light (or stamp them out with an army), fight (or join) an invasion, and more.

They would do so using wholly original races (even humans will be differentiated by a few mandatory background choices) and tweaked classes (fewer tweaks here, as PF provides less rules for a newer GM like me to ensure balance in classes than they do for races). The gods, the nations, and the history would be completely unique, and barring some pretty spectacular plane-shifting ludicrousness out of a high-level party, elements of the default setting would not enter into the campaign at any point.

I'd ideally love the campaign to alternate between plot-driven thriller and map-clearing hexcrawl (e.g., while stabilizing the southern arm of a mountain range, they might come upon the starving remnants of an ancient empire there and choose to either get involved and solve the food crisis or overthrow them and forge an empire of slaves. . . or just leave them to the wolves). Given the sheer number of pre-existing plot hooks, characters, cities, empires, polities, and ""world-events,"" along with the newly released *Ultimate Campaign* (plus maybe some elements liberally borrowed from *Kingmaker* and even the **Adventurer, Conqueror, King** system) guides to randomizing or dynamically generating world-content, if the players were willing, they could engage in an extremely lengthy game--even spanning generations if they were willing to watch their old characters age and die.

Finally, because I am largely unable to purchase or make much in the way of dungeon tiles, flipmats, miniatures, fully realized 3D to-scale dungeons, etc., I'd prefer to opt for less-tactical ""theater of the mind"" combat centered on concepts like ""at range, in close, engaged, retreating, etc."" I'm poor and a poor craftsman, and frankly find extremely particular combat to be a little boring and frustrating after awhile--but that could be because of my relative inexperience with rules (that is, it takes so long because I don't know how to streamline it).

----

So, am I a madman? Is such a thing flat-out impossible in the system, or far too much for a newbie GM to handle (even if he starts small and learns how to do new things as the players expand their range of influence)? Do Pathfinder/D&amp;D3.5/4.0/etc. players hate this kind of stuff? Should I get over my aversion to institutional racism in OD&amp;D clones and play ACKS with people instead?

It's worth noting I'm in a large urban area with a significant college and techie population.

I am going to play as a blind Druid, starting at level 2. A friend and I are going to be taking turns DM'ing, so the character won't always be acting entirely as a PC.

I discovered the Pack Lord archetype, which seems like a great fit for a blind character, although the major advantage won't come into play until 6th level. So it seems like the biggest challenge will be making it to 6th level without being too much of a burden on the rest of the party.

As per the rules regarding blindness, my co-DM and I have discussed that since my character has been blind for roughly 12 of the 17 years she has been alive, she has become accustomed to the condition.  As a result she no longer takes penalties to AC, does not lose Dex bonus to AC, and does not take a -4 to Str and Dex based skills. 

All checks and activities that rely on vision still automatically fail, and all opponents are still treated as having total concealment, however we agreed that she would get the Blind Fight feat for free. We did not discuss whether she would need to make a DC 10 acrobatics check to move faster than half speed, however, given that acrobatics is not a class skill, she would need to select a trait which provides access to acrobatics in order to avoid constantly falling prone.

One possible solution to the movement issue that we discussed is to have the Woodland Stride ability slightly modified, so that rather than not leaving a trail in wilderness, my character can move through wilderness terrain more fluidly without the risk of falling prone, or having to move slowly.


Here is what I've worked out to help overcome blindness, specifically in combat.

One of the characters animal companions will be a mount, specifically a deer/elk (think Yakul from Princess Mononoke), which will have the same stats as a horse. In combat and much of the day to day activities the character will rely on her mount for movement. The mount will be combat trained and she will be primarily selecting feats from the mounted combat line of feats.

She will also memorize speak with animals on a daily basis and if she senses combat is imminent she will cast that in order to communicate clearly with her mount and help direct it in combat.

She will carry/use a quarter staff so that if she is on foot it can act as a 'white cane' but in combat it will be a shillelagh.


My biggest issue I've yet to think of a solution to is spellcasting.

Many spells require you to target an individual, and even spells that have an area of effect could potentially be difficult to cast when blind. One she gets to 6th level and can utilize her animal companions sight, then targeting spells should become do-able, but until then I'm thinking she will have to rely on melee combat, buff spells, and summoning spells.


Anyway, I wanted to see if anyone has any other suggestions or advice that I might have overlooked in playing a blind character.

Oh and by the way, I do not want to change to be an Oracle with the 'semi-blindness' drawback.

My halfling isn't fond of ""roughing it"" in the wild. I've got some GP to spend, and was considering a magical item to cast Secure Shelter each night. But reading over it, it's kind of overkill: it's sized for a whole party, and includes 6 separate 1st level spell effects. I asked my DM if I could come up with something more fitting. 

*****

Traveling Hobbit Hole
School conjuration (creation); Level cleric/oracle 3, druid 3, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3

CASTING
Casting Time 10 minutes
Components V, S, F/DF (a brass doorknob, pressed into the target surface)

EFFECT
Range touch
Effect 10-ft.-square underground structure
Duration 2 hours/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no


DESCRIPTION
You excavate a comfortable, if small, dwelling into the surfaced touched. The target area must contain sufficient volume of stable material for the hole, or the spell fails. A mountain, large bolder, hillside or even flat ground will work, while water swampland, or loose sand will not. 

The floor is level, clean, and dry, with a low 5' ceiling. The lodging resembles a normal halfling hole, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a cooking hearth (complete with cooking vessels, utensils, and a supply of firewood).

The shelter contains furnishings sized for a small creature - a comfortable down bed, a trestle table, two stools,  an armchair, and a writing desk.

When the spell effect ends, the created items disappear and the hole refills with its original material. Any creatures still inside are ejected, landing prone in the nearest unoccupied square.

*****

It's basically Secure Shelter minus the ""secure"" part, sized for a single small creature, and with a few of the comforts of home. My question is, what level would you set for this spell? And for what classes?

tl;dr - Made a halfling flavored spell between Web Shelter and Secure Shelter, seeking feedback.

The rules are about as clear as mud though.

1: Looking at a [Large Animated Object](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/animated-object/animated-object-large) as a base. For its Melee attack, it has ""slam +9 (1d6 +9)."" The Slam +9 is easy to figure out, the 1d6 is the damage die, but is the +9 the damage mod? By my calculations it should only be a +6... unless slam attacks do 1.5 STR?

Under special abilities it lists the number of [Construction Points](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/animated-object#construction-points) I get, which is 3. First I pick out is Stone, which is straightforward.

2: Second ability I'm looking at is Improved Attack, which I'm a little confused on. ""All the Animated Object’s melee or ranged attacks do damage as though it were one size category larger"". Is that just the damage dice, or for that attack is the STR bonus the same as for the larger Animated Object? That would take 1d6 +9 (or +6 if its just normal STR) to 1d8 +15 (or +10 for normal STR). Just a d2 die bump isn't worth it, but a d2 +4-6 would be worth it.

3: The [Building and Modifying Constructs](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/building-and-modifying-constructs) page under **Pricing a new Construct** states ""Constructs with multiple special abilities cost more to create. The first special ability is included in the construct’s base cost."" The only thing listed under Special Abilities on the Large Animated Object page was the 3 CP, does that mean those are the ""Special Ability""? Or can I use one of those CP for an actual ability from the Bestiary? 

Farther down it says ""Animated objects are a special case—their base price is not increased by any abilities paid for with Construction Points, since these abilities are already factored into an Animated Object’s CR."" which leads me to think I can only use CP based abiliities. This is offset by the first paragraph of the [Animated Objects](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/animated-object) page which says ""Stats are included here for Tiny through Colossal animated objects (with Construction Points that have not been spent to gain additional abilities)"".

By my confusing read of this, I'm thinking I can use my 3rd Construction Point to pick out an ability to add to my construct, such as listed in actual Bestiary listings for constructs like the [Soulbound Doll](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/constructs/soulbound-doll).

4: I see on the Building and Modifying Constructs page it talks about **Weapon Modification**. Does simply adding a weapon to a construct replace its Slam attack with the weapon attack? Or is there a CP cost required to change that?

5: I can find no rules about using a construct as a mount. Is this within the rules?

I'm having some trouble with my local PFS Game Day organizer. I have been playing with him and several others for over a year, and recently he made what seemed (to me at least) a very prejudicial and personal decision to ban me unilaterally from my local tables. I haven't been rude or disruptive, in fact if i think i have i immediately apologize, even if i haven't been. I have had a generally good relationship with him as a GM, player and event organizer. But with this ban now in place, I can't make it to other games in my area due to distance/transportation issues, and it feels like i have been left out in the cold.

Now since it usually helps you guys to know the whole story, i will give it to you, leaving out names to protect the innocent (and not-so-innocent).

2 weeks prior to today, I had played two adventures on the prior area gameday, both with this GM, whom is also the organizer. Let's call him M. M was great that day, keeping the game going, moving things along without railroading too much, generally doing a good job as GM. So the day ends, and its ~2130 or so. As i am packing up, the game already finished and most of the players departing or had done so already, i recieve a call from a friend of mine, let's call her A. A requested my help in procuring some medicinal-grade herbs for a mutual friend of ours. My phone's speaker was turned up so i could hear her better, and when she mentioned that specifically, (i had NO idea she wanted this, she never needed it before, but friends are friends you help them out, right?), the GM looked up from his clean-up/pack-up, and informed me that he had heard someone mention said herbs.

Now, I'm in my 20's, and most of my friends are fairly lax when it comes to these things. Since it had never been an issue before/never brought up before, i informed him that I was headed out to assist A. 
Here is where the crux of the problem stems, and what he, M, decided the reason for said ban: when he told me that not only was i to quit any involvement in such things, but that he regarded myself and my friend as immoral and despicable. I politely informed him that it wasn't any of his business, and that since i do not meddle in his private affairs outside of the gaming table, he should respect me enough to do the same. He told me that i should leave immediately, as he felt a moral obligation to summon the constabulary. I left, and i did not say many of the things i would have liked to say to him that evening. 
After i returned home, i promptly wrote him a quick e-mail, asking him to agree to disagree regarding personal lives and issues, and that i hoped that it would not affect our gaming relationship. after 2 weeks, he replied, and said that i was banned from PFS play henceforth, and that he believes me to be immoral and depraved.

Now i KNOW this is a huge text block, and i apologize. But since i have no other recourse, I was hoping my fellow redditors and pathfinders might assist me in finding a way through this, as it has gotten quite murky and dark treading through this now treacherous swamp of morality and accusations. Before I take any formal action though, do any/all of you have any advice for me?

- The Oracle's Curse abilities for the eyesight curse are usable and will advance as stated in the entry.

That's about it. So far I am tossing around ideas in my head of making a Half-Elf Monk that has the Vow of Peace, uses almost nothing, but Readied Actions, and takes advantage of Feats such as [Strike Back](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/strike-back-combat---final) (depends on the situation for usefullness), [Disrupting Shot](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/disrupting-shot-combat) (finding a way to fulfill the Fighter level 6 requirement), [Target of Oppurtunity](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/target-of-opportunity-combat-teamwork) (maybe via Inquisitor's Teamwork ability), and [Rhino Charge](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/rhino-charge-combat) (to be quite deadly if I go for a blind charge build).

What I'd like to know is what kind of Class, Race, Archetype, PrC, Feats, or etc of ""combos"" am I possibly not seeing that might fit in w/ having the Condition: Blind, hitting unseen targets, or using the Ready Action?

I tend to play thematic characters, so I'm not looking for obscene min/maxing here. (Example: I was thinking of keeping the Skill Focus Feat gained from being a Half-Elf and choosing Perception to signify the exchange that went from the loss of sight to the slight increase in hearing over time.)

I've had an original group of five players, IRL friends, and from that original group, only 1 remains that still is playing. No matter, I figured that my players still needed to be sure wether they wanted to play, so now I've got a group of five enthusiastic players.

Alright, enough backstory.

One of my players is great during the sessions. He RPs alongside the rest, figures out exciting tactics during combat, and blends in well with the group (Ranging from a restaurant chef to a biology teacher and a stoner dude).
So during the sessions there's no problem.

But as soon as I ask him to do ANYTHING outside of the sessions, like writing a short backstory, leveling up his own character, reading up on some additional rules about his class (Paladin), he just doesn't do it. I tried giving incentives (I give my players a bonus for having a well-rounded backstory and character, sometimes it's a specific skill boost, a perk/flaw combination, XP, you name it) but he clearly stated that he doesn't want to devote any time to it.

Now, my first suggestion to other people on this reddit is to talk to the player about it, and I have, but he just doesn't seem to think it is important to me, despite me saying so.

I would have no qualms of tossing him out of the group, seeing as he is an IRL friend of mine and knows how seriously I take the game, but this isn't important enough, especially since I enjoy his presence during the sessions.

*EDIT 2: Belay that, the crit threat calculation at low probabilities is wrong too. &lt;--- this ended up not affecting the calculations much, except it made Keen look better than it is at very low hit probabilities.*

You can copy this spreadsheet to check your own stats. The light green boxes are the ones you want to edit. You could also add other possible modifiers (which I haven't implemented). Share back any interesting results!

Previous arguments were just squabbles; I would insist he's an agent of the devils, and he would protest that he's merely lawful neutral drawing upon powers that would help avenge the bandits that enslaved him in the past.  Nothing got out of hand...until this previous encounter.

After fighting a group of zombies raised by a Thunderbird rider (who unfortunately escaped), the halfling and I were attacking the last remaining zombie.  I rolled a 20, scoring a threat, but a 1 on my confirmation roll.  Our GM ruled that I hit and dealt damage, but my greatsword was lodged in his ribs. Halfling's turn followed mine, and he proceeded to finish it off with an Eldricht Blast.  Although it wasn't enough damage to harm my sword in any way, it was torn out of my hands and was flung into a puddle of nearby mud.  Angry, I demanded greater care and respect for the valuable heirloom of my tribe.  He responded derogatorily.  And I took exception to that. 

As the GM stood up to begin putting away the mat, his encounter finished, I asked him to sit down for a moment.  I walked over to my halfling companion, and began grappling with him.  He failed his escape artist check, and on his turn he started to cast eldricht blast.  He had to make a concentration check, but since eldricht blast is a spell-like ability for him, his Concentration check to pull it off was amazingly easy; I believe all he had to do was roll higher than a four.

The gods must be kind, for he rolled a 1.

Having gotten the free pin, I was holding him face down in mud, demanding an apology, until the paladin finally noticed our struggles and intervened.  She made a plea to our party spirit, our communal struggle, but nothing worked till she threatened to dock my pay.  Suddenly ""coming to my senses,"" I picked up the poor little guy, wiped him down a bit, let him go.  By this time my friend playing the halfling was furious [see second edit], and promised to never come to my aid again, while at the same time promising a slow and agonizing vengeance someday, which finally brings me to my question.

I wish to get the jump on this pretentious little OP as balls character.  As a warlock, I know he's planning something nefarious, but at least I have some idea of what his character can do.  As a Sorcerer who hasn't revealed his magical prowess except in the subtle, oblique ways, I have a whole host of options, the first of which I would like to be Bestow Curse.  However, to out-sneak him, I want to apply the curse while he sleeps.  According to the pathfinder srd, an unconscious target is automatically counted as ""willing"" and forgoes his will save.  Will this wake him up?  And more importantly, the spell description says nothing about being limited to one curse. Do multiple bestow curses stack?  I can't imagine my GM will let me give -6 to every stat, but I can't find a ruling that says I cannot.  What would you GMs allow, and how do you players feel about this?  Your feedback will determine how I present this to my GM for our next session. 

Edit: Some words.

Second Edit: So a lot of you seem to think this is something to avoid entirely.  That my character is a ""psychopath"" and that I'm ruining the game for the other players.  I've made several replies about this, but I thought I'd add the key points up in here.  At the table, we're all friends, regardless of what goes on in game.  We're not going to break immersion, destroy old friendships, be so immature as to get tied up in this.  Everyone in the room had a good time playing this out or just watching from the sidelines.  Everyone.  Even the halfling's player, despite being ""furious"", privately told me he was having fun. We like variety, the unexpected, sticking to a personality for our characters.  Having a laugh is more important than just slogging through monsters between point A and B.  If it carries on? So be it.  We settle it? Okay.  Regardless, as of now our two characters are stuck in an antagonistic feud.  I've gotten a lot of great advice on how to proceed, from hiring an independent Inquisitor to investigate the halflings Devil-pact, to inspirations for several methods of cursing him.

More people were there than we even expected, the group was up to 11, and I'm afraid it was going to keep growing.

    Abilities
    0 Points - 1 ability point per 3 levels    
    1 Points - 1 ability points per 2 levels
    2 Points - 2 ability points per 2 levels
    3 Points - 1 ability point per level
        Can substitute Str for Con, Dex for Int, or Wis for Cha or

    Feats
    0 Points - 1 feat/2 levels
    1 Point - 1 feat/level
    2 Points - 2 feats/level
    3 Points - 1 feat/level - No stat/BAB/feat requirements for feats

    Spells
    0 Points - free spells as Paladin/Ranger
    1 Point - free spells as Bard/Inquisitor/Alchemist/etc.
    2 Points - free spells as Wizards/Sorc/Cleric/Oracle/etc.
    3 Points - 1 spell like ability per level of level castable by 
           Wiz/Sorc/etc. Useable 1/day + 1/day each level after
           DC based of highest stat

    Unforged (weird leveled magic weapon thing)

    1 Points - 3 points/level
    2 Points - 4 points/level
    3 Points - Dual Unforged (2 with 3 points/level)

An Anti-Paladin, a Monk and a Wizard. This is the first time I've really tried to do an evil adventure because every time I've seen it tried it always falls through.

The three players all had their lives torn apart and have had everything they've loved stolen from them. They all followed the trail until they all had one thing in common; They were all after the same man. They eventually met up along their own separate travels learning they were all after him.

Over the course of 4 sessions they found a good lead, learned his location, followed his trail and are now coming up on him fast. I've figured they'd catch up to him in a session or two.

Here is my Dilemma. Well, actually it's a few things. Here they are.

1. When they catch and kill him, then what?

   When the man they seek is dead they'll have no motive to travel together anymore. They have all stated they are only together to catch him. And I don't want to force something upon them to make them stay as a party. I'm all about choice. This leads to my next question.

2. I know I could prolong the chase but I don't want it to be too cliche or 'scapegoatish'.

    I could just let him teleport away of something like that but that makes them feel like no matter what they do he'll get away. i just don't know how to keep it interesting. Since they have no moral standards and are only together for this man. Once he's gone I've got nothing.

So I'm playing around with a character of mine, which is the first one I've had that possesses natural, racial Scent (ratfolk, taking the alternative trait). The penalties are harsh but I'm confident that the extra ability will trump boring +2s. Getting scent otherwise is rather expensive (you basically need to be barbarian with the right rage power, or half-orc/orc and take a feat... or the full-blooded Orcs can trade away their Ferocity and weapon proficiencies, yuck). There's also Alter Self to become an appropriate race that *has* scent but you need a piece of the original creature whose forms (and abilities) you are assuming.

So anyway. I'm thinking that there's got to be some reasoning why scent is one of those things that the normal adventuring party is not ""supposed"" to have easy access to, like flight.

Uses that have already come up or seem obvious:

- Make tracking easier on hard surfaces (like a dungeon floor)  
- Thwart Alter Self and similar illusions, especially if they didn't change their clothes  
- Automatically detect invisible creatures within 30'  
- Identify spellcasters that use material components (ever smell bat guano and sulfur?)  
- Gunslingers and alchemists too, I guess.  
- No darkvision? Find your way to someone's bed in pitch blackness anyway.

Classified as Monstrous Humanoid (3 RP) (Dark vision and smaller est. 5'5"")
Ability Scores: +2 Dex +2 Wis -4 Int (-1 RP)

Bite (2x1 RP): Prerequisites: Small or larger size; Benefit: Members of this race gain a natural bite attack, dealing damage equivalent to that of a creature two size categories lower than normal for their size (1d2 for Small races, 1d3 for Medium, etc.). The bite is a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the creature is wielding manufactured weapons. Special: This trait can be taken up to two times. The second time it is taken, the bite damage increases by one size category.

Carrion Sense (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have a natural ability to sniff out carrion. This functions like the scent ability, but only for corpses and badly wounded creatures (creatures with 25% or fewer hit points).

Weapon Familiarity (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Choose up to two weapons, or one weapon and a racial weapon group. When choosing a racial weapon group, you must choose a group that includes the same name as one of your subtypes. Members of this race are proficient with those weapons. For the purposes of weapon familiarity, all bows are considered one weapon. Special: This trait can be taken up to two times. The second time it is taken, the race becomes proficient with another two weapons or one weapon and a racial weapon group. (Simple and bladed weapons made of bone).

And I really like this one.
Frightful Gaze (Modified to Laugh)(6 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race gain the following supernatural ability: Creatures within 30 feet of a member of this race that meet its gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + the 1/2 user's character level + the user's Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A target that successfully saves cannot be affected by the user's frightful gaze for 24 hours.

Light Blindness (–2 RP): Prerequisite: Darkvision or see in darkness trait; Weakness: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds members of this race for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.

Race builder says Standard=1–10

Monstrous Humanoid 3
Ability scores: Weakness -1
Bite 2
Carrion Sense 1
Weapon Familiarity 1
Frightful Laugh 6
Light Blindness -2
Total= 10

The Gnolls in my mind are tribal and stubborn in their traditional ways. Wise in the way of nature and the hunt, but defiant about learning new methods. Metal is alien to them, so they forge weapons from the bones of their enemies or prey. They fear magic unless it is accompanied by nature. This would make for some good Rogues, Fighters, Rangers and to a lesser extent Druids.

I need tips/tricks/ideas on how to avoid him finding me out while maintaining my position within the organization. I am 6th level gestalt cleric/vitalist
To explain why I must maintain my position in the organization, I will explain briefly. Basically, I am an evil character within an evil party of players. We were originally sent to unravel this organization so another could come and over take the one I am in currently. However in a sudden change of events my party members decided they liked the cause of the wizards organization and are now attempting to keep it in tact. However my character has signed a geas (unknown to the party) to take out the head of the wizards organization. So now in the large scale battles I spend my time sneaking about trying to cause as much havoc to the wizards agents as possible without being too obvious. Luckily to this point I have been very successful with my sneaking as not even the party (in character and out of character) have no idea whats going on. But now the wizard has caught the scent of my character and means to put an end to it.

*Gerrid, Human, Rogue (Having chosen to roll his hit points each lvl, he has never rolled anything but a 7 -- he is a two-weapon combat striker with more hit points than anyone else in the party, which comes in handy as he tend to get out of range of Cure X Wound spells).

We have 7 players at the table- our biggest issue seems to be time management. It can take upwards of 45 minutes to get back around to your turn with all the bad guys and other players (and their familiars or pets or summons). People lose interest and have no idea what is happening at the table by the time their turn does come up, which drives me crazy! Also, our battles either end in 2 rounds (making even round/level spells insanely strong) or drags for days.

Besides that- the amount of scaling I have had to do to the monsters presented in the book is kind of insane. Pretty much every one of my bad guys gets a +4 to their constitution and whatever their main stat is, or I will double minions, or group together bad guys from different rooms hoping to make a more involved encounter.

I've had to keep the XP of these monsters the same to keep the party at the right pace for the books, they're inching ahead almost always, and like I said there are 7 of them, not 4, so they pretty much demolish everything. I'm considering skipping several of the encounters in the next book to put them into harder territory earlier. I am also considering removing the availability of many magic items. Currently (at level 10) anything they have money for, they can buy- all items are available. It has made them pretty powerful. I don't think I want to scale it back down to what the book offers (A D3 of medium level magic items, or something else extreme), but I'm sure this would help slow them down- although HOLY CRAP will it piss off my players.

Other advice? suggestions? Thoughts on my ideas? Kicking people out is not an option and we don't meet enough to split into two groups. Does anyone here have experience with this?

To start off, I kind of have a ""thing"" for grafts.  By ""thing,"" I really mean ""horrifying addiction.""

My Magus has the following grafts:  

1 Massive NightShade Eye taking up most of my forhead

1 Pair of Displacer Beast tentacles coming out of the back of his shoulders

1 Ghost hand at the end of one of the Tentacles

1 Pair of Draconic-ish Wings

1 Fiendish Long Arm graft (right arm)

1 Fiendish Fast Leg (His other leg is normal.  So he has a gangsta lean)

And finally:
1 Arm of a Hecatoncheires (It's 6 feet long and replaced my left arm)

If you couldn't tell, this is a very laidback, super-highly-epically-powered campaign.  It's been a lot of fun and no one takes it very seriously (hence my ability to take random parts from monsters and graft them to myself).

So the other night, we stole from a really powerful lich wizard and he had a few random body parts laying around his lair including 2 Hecatoncheires arms and the head of some epic-level madness creature.  After our escape (for now), all of us were concentrated on attaching these grafts on ourselves.  That was until we found out the details.  The DM gave us a 90% chance to die outright with no chance be revived immediately after attaching one of the arms.  Even if you survive, there is a 95% chance that the arm will start regenerating back into a full Hecatoncheires and destroy our entire plane of existence.  

So I immediatly volunteer, summon and bind a devil to perform the surgery, and cut off my disgusting ""normal human"" arm to get started.  The DM picked a random range of 10 numbers for the first roll, and nails it.  Then, I let him pick the next range (he's luckier than I) and he gets it again.  So, all I'm missing now is a new left leg and something fun for my stomach and my character will be complete.

TL,DR: DM Gives me a .5% chance to graft an arm on myself from one of the strongest beings in the universe.  Nails it.

I was just posting it here to see if anyone could sketch a picture of my character for me.  I'd just like a momento of the epicness of getting that arm and I have absolutely no artistic talent.

comparing a common crossbow, to a revolver, a piece of technology that should revolutionize warfare, this is what we get.

revolver 4000 Gp vs Crossbow 35 Gp. Okay revolver is new technology, make sense that it's expensive, means it's going to be awesome right?

damage : Small Crossbow, 1d6 Small Revolver 1d6, Medium, 1d8 for both.

Same damage for both? that does not make sense.

Critical, crossbow critical on 19-20, and does X2 damage. Revolver does X4 but only on a 20. Depending on your preference Crossbow may actually have the advantage here.

Range: Crossbow 80ft Revolver 20. Revolver has 1/4 the range. So advantage goes to the crossbow.

damage types, Crossbow is P while revolver is P and B, so revolver has an advantage here.

And it top it off, firearms can break when you misfire (nat 1)

Wall of text incoming!  I'm kind of long-winded, heh.

So the group I usually play with was joking around about campaigns where everyone plays the same class (initially spurred by [this](http://i.imgur.com/V7XIS.png)), and we actually liked the idea of an all-bard campaign.  I'm normally a player rather than a DM, but the concept seemed silly and fun, so I'm volunteering to run a medium-short (expecting roughly 6 sessions max) game on these rules.  I don't *think* any of my players are regular redditors, but if you do then you know we're planning this game and you know my username so stop reading here!  :P

Anyhow, it's going to be a rather comedic (I hope), not-very-serious little game.  If you've ever seen Metalocalypse, that's very much the sort of vibe I'm going for here.  We're looking at 4 players now, but I might see if I can get a 5th.  The players are all starting at level 6, will probably hit 7 after two sessions, and finish out at 8 for the last two.  All Paizo-published feats/races/archetypes/etc. are allowed (the game is not going to be super-intensive and generally I'm the only min/maxer of the group so we should be fine).  They're allowed to multiclass, but at any given point at least half of their levels must be in Bard and they must have the maximum ranks possible in at least one Performance style.

The party is going to be an actual band, somewhat renowned across the globe for their unorthodox performance and totally brutal shows.  The game starts off with the band in some rather hideous debt and a bit of a downswing in popularity.  They're specifically at a rather fancy dinner to try and get some more positive publicity.  A ballroom blitz breaks out as some hired thugs bust in and attack their manager.  Turns out he'd gotten his hands on several maps to some treasures that could turn their career back around - artifact instruments from legendary rockers.

So the main meat of the game will be them flying their tour airship around to recover these instruments with a very soft time limit of ""before the show"" - their next big concert on the top of a volcano was scheduled at the last possible second before the loan sharks come to collect.  I'm not actually going to track or impose any kind of solid time limit, but it'll help keep the game focused and from meandering too much, as well as add some ""do or die"" tension to the actual final ""encounter"" of the performance itself.  I'm running into a couple of snags.

1.) The artifacts are going to be in individual little dungeons that the players can tackle in any order.  So the game will be narrow in focus, but not completely linear.  The only problem this really creates is the players are essentially voting on who gets awesome stuff first.  The instruments aren't going to be super unbalancing, just a +3 to relevant Perform checks (only 1 higher than the standard rules for Masterwork Magic instruments as per the book), but do you think this could be an issue?  The players are all pretty chill so I think they'll be fine, but I could see it being annoying playing a game where everyone gets shiny new things and you're the very last to get one, thus also having the least total time to make use of it.

2.) Along the same lines, one of the players basically just wants to play as a roadie - a Half-Orc that I'm houseruling can use Perform (Flex) to work his guns that works mechanically as Perform (Dance) and is just [too hot to handle](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ultimateCombat/spells/blisteringInvective.html).  What should I do for him?  Legendary pyrotechnics kit?  That seems like a stretch, heh.

3.) Each dungeon is going to end in a similar way.  They have to open a vault with the power of their rocking - basically just a magical door that reacts to a specific type of Peformance.  The idea I have now for these seems a little...  Plain.  Basically the character whose instrument they're going for will have to sit out of a combat to simply concentrate entirely on performing until the door opens.  Meanwhile, the other characters will have to protect them from a small swarm of the dungeon's thematic enemies.  Basically what I'm looking at is a medium-low DC that they have to make every turn.  Every round they pass, they accrue a success.  Failure doesn't lose a success, they just don't gain one that turn.  Being attacked or otherwise distracted will obviously confer a penalty.  When they get a certain number, say 6 successes, the door opens and the monsters flee from the sheer metal they witness inside the vault and the encounter ends.  Does this sound good?  Is there a way to spice it up, maybe?  What the hell would the roadie do for his dungeon?

4.) Puns!  Any and all puns, jokes, references you can think of.  All of the instruments are going to belong to legendary rockers that are clearly expies for real musicians, and I like throwing in groan-worthy jokes otherwise.  Each dungeon is going to have thematic enemies like grunge golems or devilkin that literally ""throw the horns""...  All of the dungeons will be these elaborately decorated tombs dedicated to the musician, except the bassist's tomb has a giant pillar blocking the entrance from sight and instead of themed guardians it's just inhabited by some goblins slumming it because they didn't know who he was, jokes like that.

We've been playing through an old, classic Swedish campaign for a completely different game (""Den Femte Konfluxen"" for Drakar &amp; Demoner, for any Swedes out there). Due to my studies, I really haven't had the time to sit down and rebalance and change everything to fit into the Pathfinder rules and/or mindset. I've mostly been winging it, which so far has worked out quite well.

Thing is, my players are now around level 8 and they don't really have a single magical item - except two swords that they picked up early on that are completely balanced according to the other game's rules. As the campaign progresses, and the enemies reach higher CRs, I fear that we'll run into a bit of a snag when anything more or less can obliterate them.

I'm toying around with the idea of making a melee combat-oriented sorcerer for a pathfinder campaign that will hopefully be starting up soon. I'm fairly familiar with 3.0/3.5 but don't have a ton of experience with Pathfinder. The core of the idea is to put my highest attribute scores into strength and charisma, use a big two-handed weapon (probably a greatsword, but I'm also thinking about a glaive), and self-buffing spells to boost my melee-combat abilities. Stuff like *True Strike*, *Magic Weapon*, *Bull's Strength*, and *Heroism*. I'll likely be taking the ""Abyssal"" bloodline. Overall the idea is to be able to fight competently on the front lines while also having a few magic tricks up his sleeve (possibly some *Summon* spells?).

I've got the *basic* concept down, but could use some help fleshing out some of the details and making certain choices.

First off: Spell selection. I've got some of the basic ideas down for the lower levels (*True Strike*, *Magic Weapon*, *Mage Armor*, *Bull's Strength*, *Invisibility*?, *Heroism*, *Rage*), but I'm interested in hearing people's suggestions, particularly for the higher-levels. I'm not interested in the ""blasty"" spells like *Shocking Grasp* and *Fireball*. My Charisma score probably won't be through the roof, which puts more emphasis on ""buff"" spells and other spells that don't force my enemies to make saving throws. At first glance it doesn't seem like there are a *ton* of great spell options for this theme at the higher levels, which brings me to my next question...

To multiclass, or not to multiclass? I'm very tempted to start with a level of Barbarian. Pros: No need to spend a feat on martial weapon proficiency; a nice chunk of hitpoints to start with; Rage for even *more* strength; an extra point of BAB; picking up a Sorcerer level after character creation is easy to explain in roleplaying terms with ""innate powers being discovered"". Cons: Slower spell progression; won't hit the ""core"" of the concept until level 2; Barbarian Rage wouldn't stack with the spell *Rage* (but would give me more potential rage-time per day?). That said, if the higher-level spells don't have *that* much to offer, this becomes a more appealing option. I might even pick up more levels of Barbarian later on.

Alternatively, I could pick up some levels of Eldritch Knight later on. This would allow me a decent spell progression, more hit points, more BAB, but less progression with the Abyssal bloodline powers. It seems like all I'm *really* interested in there is the bonus strength—the other stuff is *cool*, but maybe not necessary—so the Eldritch Knight levels seem like a solid bet.

So, any thoughts/suggestions/comments in general?

It is thought that they indeed have the power to exile the Pactmasters but bitter feuds with one another prevent it. An example relayed to me was very telling:
	
An elder of the Swanzi clan struck swiftly against the Slavszisk clan. Using a great deal of the Swanzi wealth he bound a Jann to him. Through unknown magic he made the Jann abduct and rape the young daughter of a leading Slavsziskian leader. The Swanzi elder thought this would be enough to bring down the Slavszisk Clan. Through guile the Slavszisk clan managed to locate and destroy the Jann, capturing the Swanzi elder in the process. The Slavszisk clan still possess the tongue of the elder to this day. This young girl eventually gave birth to a boy whom the clan sold to the slavers.

It was later explained to me that the major clans of Katapesh view children born from rape as abominations. With such brutalities it is unlikely the clans will ever consolidate to overthrow the pactmasters.

“Indeed, there was nothing I could do. My first mate told me that a young slave, no more than 10 years of age, stood up upon seeing the Jann summoned. A gray tremor seemed to jump through his chain as the chains shattered setting 10 slaves free. Right then the Andoranians started to bombard my ships as the slaves started to attack my men. I could do nothing as they sank all three ships! By the gods I have no idea how this child broke the chains! Still, master, I swear by my right hand, that child could not have survived, whatever he was…”

“I suppose that will be sufficient payment.”

-	Translation of the interrogation of the one armed captain Sam Treddik


Whilst our cause is just it is uncertain if slaves once set free can live normal lives as free Andorian civilians. We recently rescued a boy who merely stated his name as slave “6178-002”. Perhaps the water he fell into while escaping caused permanent damage. I gave him a new name, Roy Fronde, in hope that he may find an identity outside his past. He is solemn, yet charismatic and terrifyingly strong for his age. I believe he may have a future... and will be recommending him for the cavalry. Still, despite our attempts, slavery might leave scars we simply cannot heal.

-	General Sigmund Aust, Eagle Knights, Reflections on Slavery

I had traveled through Molthune and Nirmathis, I had finally arrived in Varsaria. Lightning and I could finally rest. I appreciated the training from the Eagle Knight but I had too many objectives in life. Calmly living in Andoran was not among them. I put Lightning in the stables as I gave her a swift hug before entering the Tavern. The Rusty Blade. The drink was good, the women beautiful, the stew hardy. I was well on to my third drink when I heard a slight commotion. Looking behind me I saw a massive half-orc looking threateningly down at a bard. He had a Taldoran look about him as he looked arrogantly up at the half-orc. 
	
I was half tempted to watch the fool get flattened before I saw his bags. Full of books and scrolls. If I was to achieve my dream I needed a scholar of some sort. He looked fool enough to take directions. Some spoiled noble’s son by the look of him. Sizing up the half-orc I quickly moved behind him just as he knocked the Taldorian on his arse. Pulling out a dagger or two I went up to the half-orc telling him to back off the idiot unless he wanted to taste his own blood. For a moment or two I thought things might get fun but he backed down. I walked over and helped the fool to his feet, introducing myself. As we sat down he stared at me wide-eyed as I took a long drink. In a quick breath he asked me, “Roy… can I write a story about you?”

I'll be at the game as soon as I can, but I'll be late. I'll get a Linnae *(his character)* sheet to you guys before gametime so you can run her for the first part of the giants/dragons combat.

That'll work out for the best I'm sure.

*20 minutes later*...

**Player**: My ideas on how that would work out 'for the best':

The dragon is a ""fleshie"", one of a sad and misunderstood subculture of dragons who like to go to cons dressed up as / polymorphed into bipedal humanoids, and who look at humanoid porn afterhours in the scrying mirror. Other dragons think his fetish is extremely weird, and after a prom fiasco early last century, his mother told him he should settle down with a nice dragon girl. ""You're not allowed to bring any more girls home,"" she said, ""unless they have wings, a nice healthy claw/claw/bite attack routine, and the Multiattack to back it up.""

 When he sees Linnae in full mutagened glory, his heart skips a beat. He kidnaps our heroine and brings her back to his mountain lair, where things are awkward for a little while as knights and nobles begin showing up to rescue her, because rescuing maidens from dragons is a sure way for some adventuring street cred. 

Realizing that all her would-be rescuers are at least as bad as Aldern ""I'ma send you creepy notes, paralyze you, and tear the flesh from your bones"" Foxglove, Linnae and the dragon kill or rout all would-be rescuers and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, the midwife who delivers their firstborn turns out to be one of the dragon's old spurned lovers from SpeciesCon '08, a chronomancer using Threefold Aspect to disguise herself, who declares that on the baby's twentieth birthday, he will be sent spiraling backward in time to the moment when his parents first met.

So we are doing a new campaign. Our GM this game was the paladin of the last game I posted. The players are thus:

A Changeling Rogue
A Tiefling Witch
A Drow Sorcerer(As explained in the title)
A Human Fighter
An Orc Fighter
And A Nagaji Fey Mystic Theruge (This guy!)

Fast forward to the scene. The Sorcerer was in a mage's edifice while the rest of the party went into a highly advanced kingdom led by a highly conditioned Elf Magus who worked on educating barbarians. So there are very strong, highly intelligent guys there.

The mission is to incite any event that will cause the king to declare war to the other kingdoms.

When everyone was in the capitol, the GM described the inner workings of  the kingdom. The kingdom is built inside a pocket dimension, its maintenance is upheld by a combination of mechanical and magical constructs. The king decided that expansion was needed, but with the advanced nature of this near-Utopian kingdom, he needn't  have to physically increase the space.

So the Drow got hold of this information, so he decided to change the party's appearance into Elves for to blame it on the elven counsel in a rival kingdom, grab some Greater Dispell Magic, gave it to the crew, and simultaneously cast it.

This extradimensional spell is based on Rope Trick, the only difference is it can hold an entire nation, and the implications of dispelling. When dispelled, the inhabitants on the edge of the field were simply dropped while everyone else in the extradimensional space will be shot at the speed of light. 

The inhabitants, the buildings, anything that was not the land within the extradimension was expelled with so much force, if it wasn't for the impenetrable wall, we might not have to see the entrails throughout the kingdom's walls. The carnage was so immense, that no one couldn't  hold their stomachs unless you are a ruthlessly sadistic bastard (Like Drow in this campaign).

--------------------------------
The GM was kinda pissed.

I've got the bulk of the character hammered out, but I'm stuck on naming his horse (can't have a cavalier who doesn't name his horse!)

I was thinking to name her after one of Choral the Conqueror's dragons, but neither seems to have a name in the lore.

Any suggestions the community could give would be appreciated! Oh ya, and the mount is probably going to be a snow-white mare (barded, of course, and decked out in all her heraldic finery.)

They are magical amulets that can be added to weapons or armor which have augment slots. This system can either replace magical items, or exist alongside them for extra- interesting outcomes. 
Augments are magical items which you can add to weapons, but you can't add as many as you want. Weapons/items have 0-3 augment slots: The more slots, the rarer and more expensive. If you want to, you could make a four- slot item as a reward for completing a huge campaign, but unless these are nearly impossible to get, the system isn't very balanced. Some augments could be bought, and some would be treasure from completing adventures. 
Augments are a great way to customize your weapons and make them more powerful. Some of them can also boost the effectiveness of armor.

We haven't exactly decided how to handle removing augments. My friend wants to use the Torchlight method (You either get the weapon back or the Augments back, and the other one is destroyed). Since this isn't totally decided upon yet, we suggest you just make house rules.

Ladies and Gentlefolks, I present onto thee, a Simple Game of Bounty. One too many times, a group may gather, and nobody has a campaign in mind, or do not feel like actively running one, and as such, a Simple Game of Bounty is an entirely randomly generated campaign... generator.... guide... of sorts. Its pure intent is to give a gaming group a set of tables and rules, that allow a group to easily and quickly set up an entire game with very little set up.

While a lot of the rules were pulled from 3.5 D&amp;D, it can be applied to Pathfinder just as easily. Course, its a work in progress, so, here ya go. Feel free to try it out, give it a spin, and by all means let me know what I can do to make it more streamlined, balanced, or fun! I'm heavily open to suggestions, and this is completely for non-profit purposes. It was designed for fun, and was meant to be played for fun.

Not saying abandon any of your current ongoing campaigns for this, but, it's here in case you have a need to start a side game with no heavy work in the details.

If this is the completely wrong subreddit for this, by all means, direct me to a more proper place to share this. :)

I never had the desire to tackle crafting in 3.5, nor did my players, so even through the Pathfinder transition we remained blissfully ignorant. However, during the jump between the last campaign and this one, the surviving characters spent a period of 2 years fighting in a large-scale war. An ambitious PC who took Craft Wondrous Item asked if he could use some of this time to craft, making a case that they wouldn't be in battle 100% of the war's duration, he could increase the DC to craft faster, and he has a ring that makes him require just two hours rest to feel refreshed.

I conceded these points and gave him a small portion of the two years for some crafting. He came back with a list of things he'd like to craft, all thoroughly broken down into costs and crafting times. I've looked over the crafting section, but there's a handful of questions and uncertainties I have (number 2 is the money maker):

1. I can't seem to wrap my head around the equations. I get the days worth of crafting per 1,000 gold of item - it's all the potential variables that spin me. Many of them seem really ambiguous. What makes two magical effects ""similar""? How similar is similar?

2. Is Craft Wondrous Item strictly for preexisting book items, or is it also meant for the creation of modified/custom items? Some items on his list are a Frankenstein combination of effects pulled from multiple items of the same type. My personal favorite and the most extreme case of examples is his proposed ""*Belt of Physically Perfect Stubbornly Thunderous Resolve +2*"". Seriously, that's right from the list. He (I think) reverse engineered each item so he could find the specific cost of the magical effects he took from them to combine via book rules. I like his gusto but I don't know if something like that is normally allowed, and frankly as the DM it's kinda scary.

3. If #2 *is* kosher, what's to stop someone from giving the item some racial/skill prerequisites that they already fulfill just to bump the crafting cost down 30% or so?

4. Can you take 10 on a craft check to avoid the potential failure?

5. While we're on the topic, why is crafting a magical item so much faster than crafting a mundane one? I'm a noob to the system and only glanced the other crafts, but it seems like creating a regular longsword takes a freaking aeon compared to a *+2 vorpal flaming longsword*. And don't even THINK about crafting traps. The simplest ones take months, yet magic traps take a tiny fraction of this. Should you make every trap glow slightly after it impales something? What's up with that?

They of course wanted the weapon.  So they went in, took care of the shitty monsters, the shitty trap, and all of that with no issue whatsoever.

So it's a Cairn Wight Fighter 2.  It's wielding a broken +2 Fey Bane Bastard Sword, which it has the proficiency feat for.

I figure that a regular cairn wight with no class levels (CR4) has a +3 BAB, with a +3 strength mod (16 str) on top of that.

Going by straight stats, this boss creature (CR6 for the added fighter levels) should then have +3 BAB from being a wight, then an extra +2 for fighter levels, then *+5* to hit from its 21 strength, leading to a total of a +10 to hit, down to a +8 because it wields a broken weapon. 

WHY does the book list it at a +1 to hit instead of a +8? It couldn't do jack shit to my PCs, and they just sat there doing shit damage to it because it has AC 26 and a fuckton of health.

I've been playing with a group and things have mostly gone well. We are playing an adventure path ([Rise of the Runelords](/spoiler)) and our party is a monk (me), witch, oracle, paladin and ninja. My issue is scouting.

Whenever we enter a new area the ninja will insist on scouting ahead stealthily, which makes sense. However, this becomes tedious and lately has been taking fun from the game. Entering a new room means he looks for secret doors, searches for traps on every door and uses disable device on every door. After we choose a path, he enters using stealth, does a perception check and checks for traps everywhere in the room. 

I understand he’s just being careful, but sometimes the game becomes really boring for us non-ninjas. Last week after inspecting half a ‘dungeon’ ([the dwarven brothers’ haunted cabin on the last book of RotRL](/spoiler)) without finding a single enemy or trap (the nature of the place was clear by now) he kept scounting ahead by himself and searching for traps everywhere, leaving the rest of the party with nothing to do.

I get frustrated having these stretches of time when only the ninja is doing anything.

All of these questions have a theme of practicality for my character - I'm a low level squishy caster on a mount and I need options for the scenario when a big burly fighter gets into melee range.

1. If my mount takes a normal move action to get away, that provokes AoO - on me, or the mount, or is it (as I expect) the attacker's choice?
2. Can the mount make a 5-foot step without cutting into my options for making standard and move actions (possibly for actual movement)?
3. Can the mount make a withdraw action? If it does, does this cut into my available actions?

And to finish off we're going to go through a hypothetical series of actions. The worst has happened - an enemy beatstick has got into melee range of the caster-on-his-mount. The caster has no spells that he can reliably cast defensively *and* will remove the threat from the battle (or maybe he's flanked by two fighters so he can't just take out one). The low-level caster wants to get out of danger in one turn.

The caster defensively casts Fly on himself (it is assumed that he is confident that he will succeed). Then as a Move action he performs a Handle Animal check to command his mount to perform a Bull Rush... on himself (the caster)... aiming straight up.

By the rules as written, this bull rush shouldn't provoke any AoO from the enemy beatstick, only one from the caster on the mount (which the caster chooses to not take, obviously). The caster, due to Fly, should have practically no effective weight (and be easy to move).

I've just begun playing Pathfinder with a bunch of friends. They're all old hands at playing RPGs and while I've always been interested in them, I've never had a group of friends who were even remotely interested in playing until I befriended these guys. We've only played one game together so far, but, it was a lot of fun. I got to do what I love most in RPG/fantasy style games... Just cut everything to pieces with a big ol' greatsword and laugh while doing it. We've all written out character biographies (as you do!) and posted them to a shared google plus community where we plan everything. I posted mine the other day and our DM really dug it. He said I should post it here and see what you all think.

So, here it is. Now, I'll admit that I'm not very well versed in the Pathfinder world. I really enjoy it, but, I haven't played enough and read enough to venture that I know -anything- substantial about it. So, forgive me if there are some glaring errors in this. As we go on playing and I learn more, I'll update it/change it/ret-con it as I see fit.

Enjoy.

They always say the moon was red the night he was born.

O’ all the stories I’ve heard, all the smoke and all the lies associated with his wretched birth, every single one o’ ‘em starts with tha’.

A red moon, high in the sky, bathing the world below in its horrific, blood soaked glow. 

Some say he wasn’t true born, like us normal folk, but he was created, patched together by some of the darkest and most arcane magicks this world has ever seen. Tha’ some crazed Necromancer scoured the world, looking for the pieces of long dead heroes and warriors of legend, scavenging the corpses of the greatest champions to ever stalk the field of war. They say tha’ when the ritual was complete, he burst into life in a shower of blood, slaying the Necromancer and his familiars in an orgy of crimson soaked violence. They say he wasn’t born a child but tha’ he came into life as a full-grown man. 

Some say tha’.

Others reckon that the God of War himself, Gorum, came down from the Heavens and found himself a virgin to impregnate. He did this ‘cause he wanted to create a perfect avatar of himself in order to keep the flames of war ever burning.

I even heard one ol’ geezer in a tavern years n’ years ago whispering into his cups one night that he swore he was there tha’ night. Says he saw a crimson scar open up in the night sky and tha’ Deskari himself slammed a hand down into the earth with the force o’ a thousand hammers. When Deskari took his hand away, a child was left there, screaming and covered in blood. The ol’ man said he tried to get closer but a swarm o’ locusts chased him away. He says tha’ the child is to bring ‘bout the Apocalypse or some such nonsense. 

I tell ya, I’ve heard lots n’ lots o’ stories ‘bout him, ‘bout Ranek the Red. I cannae say any of ‘em be true. But I can tell ye the story I believe. 

They be right about the red moon, tha’ be for sure. But it was no moon o’ war, but a harvest moon.

The southlands be full of nomadic tribes, groups o’ folk living their lives day by day, traveling the great lands. They traded with some folk, warred with other folk. Normal folk, y’see. Thing about nomads is they don’t care much about what race ye be, only if ye can hold yer own and not slow anyone down. Ye can keep to yerself as much as ya like but ya gotta provide for the group.

Tha’s why Ranek be the half-elf bastard tha’ he is. His father was a man, plain as you n’ me. His mother was an Elf. Some say she was highborne, like any o’ dem Elves ain’t, or that she was a servant who ran away. Others reckon she was a drow, one o’ them who dwells in dark caverns and steals little children in the night. Some say a lot o’ things. Me? I don’t care about no she-elf bitch. She was his mother and he was her son.  Got that? 
An impure breeding if I ever heard o’ one. No good comes from mixing tha bloods and Ranek is a testament to tha’.

Eh?

Right, harvest moon. It was deep into the harvest season and the moon was bright. Ranek’s mother was long into her labour by now and all them midwives were doing wha’ they could for her. Seemed like there was trouble with the birth. 

Trouble outside, too.

Shouts rang out. They were attacked, taken by surprise. Now, these nomads be good fighters, quick as you like with a blade and not afraid to use ‘em. But these weren’t just any attackers. These were Knights, heavily armoured in full plate mail, wielding castle-forged steel and riding barbed chargers. Seems like the nomads had strayed too far into someone’s territory and were about to pay tha price for it.

It was a slaughter. Ranek’s father left his pregnant wife’s side to go join the fight, though she begged him not to. He returned to her after a time, though not in the way she would have liked. He burst into tha tent, maybe a few minutes later, screaming as flames licked over his body, crossbow quarrels sticking out of his chest and legs. He died screaming, just as the baby was born, screaming, too. 

One o’ the Knights, not even a Lord, came stomping in after the burning man to finish him off. He discovered the elven woman, legs splayed and a baby born. Ranek was still in the arms of a midwife when the Knight killed his mother with a single thrust of his spear. 

Somehow, and this be part of the mystery, tha’ midwife escaped with Ranek. Some say she seduced that Knight, on her knees right then and there. Others say she killed him, summoning up some motherly power and used a sword tha’ she would have never been able to wield normally and sliced the bugger’s head clean off. Some say it was both.

Me? I don’t care much. 

What I know is tha’ Ranek lived. Ranek was allowed to grow into the great big Barbarian bastard he is now. They say the midwife took him to the far north, to her people and there Ranek was taught how to fight and to kill and to survive. 

They say a red moon follows him wherever he goes.

They do say tha’.

Always.

And it requires a rather specific build. I'm building a character who wishes to expand his rank and eventually enlist in the military and rise to a commander of others. Now I looked over the classes and The [Battle Herald] (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/prestige-classes/other-paizo/a-b/battle-herald), is pretty much what fits the flavor. This basically requires levels in Bard, and Cavalier. Which is ok because the requirements are good classes, and both work off of CHA, which fits the character.

The game starts at 5th level, I've started with [Arcane Duelist 2] (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard/archetypes/paizo---bard-archetypes/arcane-duelist)/[Honor Guard 3] (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier/archetypes/paizo---cavalier-archetypes/honor-guard) taking the [Order of the Dragon] (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier/orders/paizo---cavalier-orders/order-of-the-dragon). He's stated out right now as a bodyguard, able to give +6AC(2 base, 1 helpful trait, 1 OotD, 2 benevolent armor) on aid another, in addition he'll be casting with a caster level of 5 in bard due to racials, and the magical knack trait. And still being somewhat competent on his own, though that's more due to his equipment than his abilities. 6'th level will be another cavalier level to get that second chalenge a day, then into Battle Herald for the full 10.

Now the problem is... the honor guard loses his charge stuff, but not his mount, and this is a problem as I'm already a quadrepedal race, so mounts don't really make sense. I was thinking that I could get the Inspiring Voice ability from the [Inspiring Commander] (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier/archetypes/rite-publishing---cavalier-archetypes/inspiring-commander) to replace the mount, as mount and banner are shown to be interchangeable in level by the [Standard Bearer] (http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier/archetypes/paizo---cavalier-archetypes/standard-bearer), so power couldn't be too bad if a little minmaxy, though even with that the flavor is perfect, what medieval commander didn't need to be heard above the battle.

Basically, I'm looking get your opinions on other options I have for replacing the mount that I'll never use. Also opinions on the build would be appreciated, even if it'll probably not change (can post the whole build if requested).

I liked some of the changes that came with the new edition, though I've forgotten what most of them were, but mostly I was just trying to keep up with the evil treadmill of products Wizards(coughcoughHASBROcoughcough) was shoving at my enthralled face. 

I'm really excited, looking at all the great PF content out there. I especially like the Psionics content put out by Dreamscarred Press. In general, one thing I -liked- getting away from was vancian magic. While I think it works well, its called Vancian magic because it is modeled after the magic system of a particular setting. I'm not playing in that setting, nor do I want to. The setting that I've been working on for over 5 years is high magic, and I expect that what sets PC's apart from other highly-skilled-but-mundane people of this world is magical characteristics... and I'm not talking about shit tons of stat-rific gear. The Mythic Adventures playtest by Paizo looks awesome, and I'll definitely be incorporating it into my game. However, I was curious if anyone here had any suggestions for balanced alternatives to the vancian magic system (besides the weird words of power system). I've seen a couple ideas for spell points or ""mana"" systems, which convert spells per day to points that are spent on any known spells (essentially making everyone a lot more sorcerer like). Anyone have any experience with that? Could it be balanced by other things? I personally like the idea of spells requiring a roll of some kind against an opposing defense. Magic may be common for PCs but it shouldn't be easy to execute, or without consequences of failure. Maybe I could find a way to provide spellcasters with more spells but have it come at a price? (health, sanity, some kind of pool?) 

I get that I probably won't find much. Most people just seem to say ""refluff psionics. done."" But I'm curious, and I know there are endless bounds of creativity out there! I'm also curious if there is any way to convert the spellcasting levels of a class to psionics, such as a ranger, or even a cleric (with power lists for domains and keeping some of the iconic class features). Is there any rule to substitute powers known/ power points per day progression for spells known/ spells per day progression? 

Any and all ideas, shoot! Positive feedback please. I know the arguments for Vancian magic, and I also know that I prefer the PF system while also disliking that kind of magic for -my kind of games-. I'm not here to yuck your yum, and please give me the same courtesy.  I'll use it if I have to, I just am curious about alternatives! Thanks!

Sorcerer 1 (Crossblooded draconic and orc), wizard 5 (no specialty needed)

Feats (with the wizard bonus feat at 5, can be done without needing human for the bonus feat):

1.Spell focus evocation

2.Spell Specialization (fireball)

3.Tattooed spellcaster (evocation)

4.Bloodmage Initiate (evocation)

Trait:
Gifted Adept (fireball)

The feats and trait combine to give a total bonus to casting fireball of +5 to your caster level. The sorcerer bloodlines give a total of +2 damage per die rolled to fire spells. So you have a terrifyingly dangerous fireball at 5th level.

Late edit: I know most people won't read this by now, but I've figured out how to do 15d6+40 at level 7. The combination is spell specilization, the trait ""metamagic master"" with the feat intensify spell, gnome with the fire magic alternate, robe of flame, cracked orange ioun stone, a goblin fire drum, tatooed spellcaster, bloodmage initiate, and dual-bloodline orc/draconic.

Obviously deities and major demon/devil lords can and often do project their images or perhaps even avatars onto the Material Plane with probably little effort. But is there a rule or general consensus within Pathfinder as to how deities and other major powers truly enter the Material Plane? For example, I'm sure Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undead, would delight in fully transferring himself to the Material Plane and causing havoc for a while.

As I see it, there are two possible explanations that come to my mind (at least) as to why deities and major powers rarely, if ever, fully enter the Material Plane:

* Inherent threat and risks. I assume that once any being, regardless of how powerful, enters the Material Plane then he or she stands a chance of being killed. Obviously that can happen on any Plane, but I find it highly unlikely that Orcus is going to be somehow murdered or slain in his own realm unless done so by other god or opposing demon. So perhaps they don't do so for fear of these chances, however small they might be?

* The other possibility I see is that there is a general agreement among the deities not to directly enter the Material Plane. If this scenario is true, then Orcus or Asmodeus do not shift themselves to our worlds because they would then receive the full brunt of opposition from practically every good, neutral, and perhaps even other evil deities. So this threat of uniting the other powers against [insert deity here] is more than enough to persuade them not to even attempt to plane shift to worlds like Golarion?

Until now I have played spontaneous spellcasters and enjoyed them, but I'd like to give the other side a try.

Anyway. Two questions!

1) How on Earth do you folks manage to anticipate beforehand which spells you'll need? I would think this would cause problems with, for example, preparing too many Fireballs and too few Hastes. Spontaneous casters don't have to worry about this, and I've quite enjoyed that particular freedom. Short of simply preparing one of everything, I'm not sure how I will be able to deal with this.

**Edit:** Yikes, I can't believe I didn't think of scrolls, and how I can use them to supplement my spells/day. Thanks, people. This is gonna completely change how I play my wizard.

2) On creating a higher-level wizard: A 1st-level wizard begins play with three 1st-level spells (plus his Intelligence modifier in bonus spells) and gains two spells of any level that he can cast when he levels up. However, he also has the ability to learn new spells from scrolls and spellbooks. Therefore, I'm noticing a difference between a wizard who is created at 7th level and a wizard who starts at 1st level and is played up to 7th level. The newly created 7th level wizard will have three 1st-level spells (plus his Intelligence modifier in bonus spells) and twelve additional spells of any levels he can cast. The normally played 7th level wizard, on the other hand, will have those spells as well as spells he's learned from scrolls and spellbooks in the course of his adventures.

When creating a higher-level wizard, are there any rules in place for closing this fairly wide gap between the two wizards? The only solution I can think of is allowing the newly created wizard to spend some of his starting gold on scrolls, and have him automatically learn those spells. I dunno, maybe it's a situation governed by house rules.

I want to keep it to friends that I have enjoyed playing with so far, so I will not be looking for players outside of my circle.  If it happens that I play with two players, I would like to supplement them with an NPC (maybe two if absolutely necessary), but I really want to avoid them playing multiple characters because of the ""sin theme"" tally that is discussed in the appendix of the Anniversary Edition of this book.

If I have NPCs join them I want them to join at their level and level up with them.  I don't really want them to grow out of the NPCs at their side unless there are later options of higher level good NPCs that can replace Ameiko or Shalelu.  I would like to split exp to the NPCs equally since they will be contributing, but I'm not sure what to do about loot and I fear the players may get greedy or feel cheated if an NPC wants an item.  With the ""sin theme"" in mind I think this could play out great, but I don't want to lead them to committing sins every time loot comes up (though theoretically without NPCs in the mix it could be just as bad).

Here's some campaign information:

   * Single Empire ruled by ascended tyrant

      * The dragon has a branch of the government to oversee the noble houses composed of two separate groups

         * The Faith

            * The Ministry of Faith keeps everyone in line.  They are few, but each is extremely powerful and is a judge, jury, and executioner.  
         * The Service

            * Ministry of Service oversees all legal business deals, from weddings and trades to real estate purchase.  All legal dealings are taxed by the Ministry of Service.  The Ministry of Service is also the only legal way of obtaining magically enchanted items.  
      * The noble houses serve him.  They are composed of kobold houses, dwarves houses, and dragonborn houses

         * House Vythrax: Kobold house of bankers
         * House Kythex: Kobold house of engineering
         * House Tysix:  Kobold house of slaves and gladiator trade
         * House Anvilward: Dwarven house of smithing and metalwork
         * House Bloodvein: Dwarven house of mining - controls all mithril and adamantine mining

         * House Swiftscale: Dragonborn house of traveling - deals in inn keeping, safe traveling, ship passage, and overland travel
         * House Athax: Dragonborn house - sole growers of bloodweed and producers of ale and wine
      * Government control is strongest in the City of Light, but falls dramatically the further out you move from the capital.  Drug-running, illegal trade, house skirmishes, and underground activity are more prevalent, as well.  
   * Elves, the original rebels, have been persecuted almost to extinction.  Feral, savage elves live on an unconquerable island far to the south, but any who still live in the empire are either working for the underground or wanderers who hide their lineage.  


The Synopsis:
The group, composed of Thakk Rumbridge, Gasbode the Wizard, Sharn Willowstrike, and Zint Albatross, met on the road at the sight of a burned wagon.  Thakk pulled a burning crate from the wagon before the flames consumed it for Sharn, who discovered fine silks and a false bottom inside.  In the hidden space, Sharn found 4 pouches of bloodweed, a controlled substance that the dragonkin are addicted to, but is an inert weed to any other races.  

The group kept the box and made their way down the road, traveling through the night, to arrive as dawn broke in the town of Umbar.  There they found lodging at The Rat's Hide, owned by Hod and his wife.  A display of magic from Gasbode forgave any cost of staying at the inn, though the wizard still offered aid, should the owners need it.  

Hod told the adventurers of a group of brutes that, for the last week, had been harassing his common room, not settling their debts, and destroying property.  The adventurers agreed to help Hod that night and went to sleep, planning to wake up in time for the ruckus after dark.

Several hours later, the adventurers woke up to the sound of the town watch pounding on their door, demanding their arrest.  

After a short panic, Gaspode was able to convince the watchmen that they needed to work off their debts and would come willingly once their work was done.  The Captain, Slynt, agreed, but posted guards at the front and back of the inn.  

After some deliberation, Gaspode made his way to the front guard to ask if they could leave the barracks, even to ask Captain Slynt questions.  The guard let him knew that the only way he or any of his companions were leaving the inn was under arrest and to the barracks.  Gaspode excused himself for a moment and retuned with Thakk, volunteering the both of them for arrest so they could get to the bottom of the problem.  

While Gaspode and Thakk were escorted to the barracks, Sharn and Zint schemed in the inn.  They decided to hide the box by tying the bedsheets together and having Sharn lower Zint to the stables.  Unfortunately, Sharn dropped Zint while lowering him, causing enough noise for the guard around the corner to investigate.  Zint ran behind a shop across the street, while Sharn climbed down the window, threw the crate into the stables, and allowed himself to be arrested.  

Back at the barracks, Captain Slynt accused Gaspode and Thakk, as well as their companions, of attacking a caravan, setting fire to it, and stealing a box from it.  While there, Rifen al'Athax, a red scaled Dragonborn noble, revealed himself, stating he had witnesses to their crimes.  

Sharn was brought in and Captain Slynt sent out more guards to find the fourth member of the group as well as the missing crate.  During this time, Thakk told their side of the story, which conflicted with the accounts of the eye witnesses.  Captain Slynt asked Rifen al'Athax to produce his witnesses.  The dragonborn was unable to do so, however, and so Thakk, Gaspode, and Sharn were at the mercy of the guards finding Zint and the box.  

Zint had, in the meantime, retrieved the box, hidden it in the alley behind the shop he had fled to, and asked the shopkeeper to hide him.  

Hours passed and neither appeared and Captain Slynt had no choice but to let the three go.  The three released captives left the barracks and made their way back to the inn, seeing Rifen al'Athax and two other dragonborn with him watching them.  Sharn gave Rifen the stink eye the whole way back.  

Back at the inn, the three returned to their room to await their original job: to run the brigands harassing the inn away.  

Time ticked by and the sun set before Hod arrived and told them the thugs had arrived.  One at a time, Sharn, Thakk, and Gaspode made their way to the common room, placing themselves around the four troublemakers, who had taken to a game of dice.  

The night wore on and the dicers grew drunker and drunker, until one of them reached across the table and punched one of his companions, knocking him to the floor.  The four brigands burst into laughter and as the prone man stood, he grabbed Hod's wife and attempted to make her sit on his lap.  She managed to get away, but Thakk knew that was it.

After missing in his first attempt to get their attention, the barbarian pounded the table and demanded their apology to Hod's wife.  This earned him a punch in the face.  The punch earned the brigands far more.

In an instant, Gaspode had dazed one of the four, Thakk and knocked out the thug who had punched him, and Sharn had managed to bury her longsword in the chest of a third, by way of his neck.  

Zint, managing to hear the commotion, sneakily made his way to the inn and entered just in time to see Thakk shoving one of the brigands against a wall and demanding they apologize to Hod and his wife.  The brigand wet himself and crawled over to the wife, begging forgiveness.  

Reunited, the adventurers let the three thugs run from the inn while Hod and his wife cleaned up the murder.  

Realizing it was high time for them to be on the road, the adventurers hastily grabbed all their gear and left out the back of the inn, retrieved the crate, thanked the cigar-maker that had hid Zint, and started to make their way into the wilderness.  

Just as they got past the last building in Umbar, they heard a commotion coming from the front of the inn.  In mere moments, the front of the inn was engulfed in flame.

For instance, in our previous campaign, I played a monk that had higher AC than everyone (except the Barbarian when he chose to use his shield instead of 2h), but when I would get hit (which happened more often than I would have expected), I got hit HARD, 2-3 shots would take me out. Granted, he only got up to about level four.

Now, I'm playing a Paladin using 2h weapons and wearing medium armor (still level one, buying items from max gold based on class, so I couldn't afford the weapon I wanted and proper heavy armor yet), and even though I only have 16 AC I still kind of feel tougher. Maybe it's the fact that I have a nice 2h I can reliably hit with and deal good damage on.

Is it worth worrying about AC / max HP as a melee fighter? It sounds kind of stupid to write that out, but I wanted more opinions. Or is it better to try and glass cannon everything?

My friends and I have just moved on from the beginner's box, and started one of the adventure books. but i've found that 70% of the time seems to be asking if they can do something, or us being confused about rules. Being the GM of the group, i attempt to consult the rulebook, but it can be very difficult to navigate. Most of the time we end up having to stop playing for 5-10 minutes as one of the brings out the laptop and google searches a rule or mechanic. The only time things seem to go smoothly is in combat - and that is only until someone tries to deviate from standard attacks, then we have to work out the logistics of a spell or ability. 


Is there anyway to get this moving smoother? It seems like there are way too many rules to keep track to the point that it becomes less of a game, and more of a scavenger hunt to see who can find how something works. For instance, in the last session we had to stop to look up: 

how often can a player heal? 

can players move past each other if they are in a hallway only a block wide? 

how long is a day? 

what determines if you can jump over a space? 

can you aim at certain parts of the body and, if so, what does it do?

when, exactly, does a perception check happen? do i offer it if i think there is something they should know, or can they walk into a room and request to do a check?

These are only a few, and we found the answer to only some of these questions.

As the GM, what am i doing wrong in these sessions? I remember watching the Robot Chicken writers play, and it went so smoothly, and it seemed really epic and fun. Ours is like a mediocre slide show, and feels like a cheap board game rather than an immersible story. 

I also ran into various issues in portraying the story. In the adventure book it gives little subtext to me things like what a villain they are fighting likes, his personality, as well as other things about the setting and people. But if it's not in a section that i am implicitly told to read to them, then i am unsure how to convey these things. In a room with only the villain, how am i to portray that he is a salty bitter old sailor? i'm new to the whole role-playing thing, so my portrayals of the NPCs are often stilted and uncomfortable.

I am friends with all of my players. We were friends before we started gaming, and most of them are parents. This means that we start late (after the kids are fed) and end late (after midnight is late, because we all have jobs and commutes, and some of us work weeekends).

Even when it's not Pathfinder, we all usually get together and play board games, or whatever. But lately, getting everyone in the same rom at the same time has been a nightmare. 

It's like herding fucking cats. 

I'm a new DM, and we're all new players, so the game moves a little slow. I wrote a great campaign about chasing goblins through an underground complex, getting trapped by a cavein and coming out the other siide of the mountain only to find that in the confusion of the last encounter, a player's character was taken for a slave by kobolds, and is being transported to Qadira to be sold.

We're at the part where the capture is *about* to happen, and I can't get everyone together to close out the chapter!!!!!!! 

I'm sorry, but it's just driving me nuts. With the school year, new jobs, and everything else (to include illness), this last section of the first chapter has been on hold for a fucking MONTH!

I love the game, I love my friends, but I think I have too many interested friends to make up a cohesive party. It's almost to the point where I want to split the group into two and run the same campaign on different nights just to be able to game. 

When I used to game in high school, the group was 4-5 people, tops. I have 7 players (and it's about to be 8), and *nother* couple interested in joining. It's like a Pathfinder orgy, and I feel like it's ruining the fun of the game for me.

*EDIT:* There semes to be a consensus that I am railroading my players (this is a new term for me). I'm not (or at least, not intentionally). The kidnapping of the pc was the player's idea (he pulled me aside between sessions, wanted to know if I could help him change characters because he wasn't happy with the mage he originally rolled, but was otherwise loving the game). I talked to the other players, made sure they knew that there was going to be a siginificant party change and got everyone's consent.

There wasnt even going to be a second chapter, but he wanted a new character, and everyone else wanted to keep the party going because when we're all together, we're havving a good time.We ended the last session early because a player didn't feel well (later turned out to be the beginnings of walking pneumonia), and then every session we've tried scheuling after that gets cancelled at the last minute for this or that. I really just want to wrap up this portion of the story.

I'm sorry if that wasn't clear in my initial whining, but I was frustrated, and didn't think to explain myself properly.

*EDIT2:* I think what I am going to do at this point is run one last session and have the kidnapping take place, and see where we stand at the end. I'll talk to my players at the end of the session and suggest splitting the party, and I'll run each one every other week. This will give the players a two week break between sessions, and allow me to work with smaller, more focused groups.

I run a group every other week where they love a real challenge, so I often put them up against moderate to well optimized PC character builds, i.e. the royal guard. They are level 11 with a well optimized party blend and are about to take on a king and his guard in a 2 on 2 duel, limited magic. I'm looking for ways to boost the kings AC to near unhitable levels as long as his guard is near. 

So far I have bodyguard, dragonic defender, benevolent armor (+4) and the idea is a cavalier for the guard. The king is in armor that is more for show then practicality because of his guard. Any ideas?

Also the 2 players in the duel (the mage and rogue are helping covertly) are a fighter with a sword and shield style and a ranger with a non-ending supply of throwing knives, dual wielded of course.

So far the following are the best ways to get more spells known as a sorcerer:

1. Be a human. The human favored class bonus for sorcerers is that they get a new spell known that's at least one level lower than the highest spell level that you can cast. 

2. Arcane Bloodline. One of the bloodline powers is getting a new spell.

3. Veiled Illusionist. The level 1 power of this PRC involves adding a new Illusion spell every level, AND these spells can be the highest spell level you can cast. You can get into the PRC at level 6. 

With just the above a Human Arcane Sorcerer 5/Veiled Illusionist 10/Sorcerer 5 will have 21 spells known on top of their normal and bonus spells. 

Anyone else want to add to this list? 

*Edit: As a side note to anyone planning on trying an Illusionist Sorcerer. I recommend a human with the racial heritage feat. Select ""gnome"" as your racial heritage and thus gain access to the gnome exclusive spells. Amongst them you can get minor/major creation as an Illusion spell. People get will saves to disbelieve them, but you can use your spellcraft check instead of the appropriate craft skill to make whatever it is you wanna make. If you take the ""focused study"" racial archetype you are forced to take skill focus at first level, but in return you get 2 extra skill focuses at levels 8 and 16. Put one of those in spellcraft and you can make almost anything perfectly.

The « Negative energy affinity » racial trait of the [Dhampir](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-dhampir) seems a little bit ambiguous to me.

I'm playing an Asmodeus cleric, so I can channel negative energy to hurt my opponents. I can also channel negative energy to heal undeads, and according to the rules of [channel energy](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric#TOC-Channel-Energy-Su-), this power « affects all creatures of one type (either undead or living) », so I can not do the two things (hurt living people and heal undeads) at once.

But Dhampirs are living creatures, so it would make sense to say « I choose to affect living creatures » and hurt my opponents/heal my dhampir friend at once. The problem is that the rule is phrased in this way:

&gt; Though a living creature, a dhampir reacts to positive and negative energy as if it were undead—positive energy harms it, while negative energy heals it.

If by « a dhampir reacts to positive and negative energy as if it were undead », they mean « consider dhampirs as undeads when reading channel energy's rule », then I can't. But if they just mean « positive energy harms it, while negative energy heals it » (like the — maybe indicate ?), then I can.

1) Excessive raising of the wealthy dead over centuries has made diamonds exceedingly rare, so purchasing diamonds is very difficult to do, unless you're in a major city and know where to look, and cost twice (or more) of their base cost. As a result, the cost of diamonds required to cast the spell also would rise accordingly. Diamonds in found treasure are usually saved for the largest hoards.

2) Not any cleric can raise any PC. 

* A cleric of the PC's deity can readily perform the resurrection. 

* A cleric not of the PC's deity, but of a deity of the same alignment as the PC's deity has a 75% chance of success.

* A cleric not of the PC's deity, but of a deity of an alignment one step away from the PC's deity has a 50% chance of success,

______________________________________________

A few things for him.

1, if he shows up at all, it'll be through a space/time rift in the middle of a fight, so he's going to be in evidence with his combat loadout and that's pretty much it (how many pockets for random jargon is there on his suit?).

2, he's a stealth-type with both close and long range weapon proficiency (Ghost/Spectre proficiency training's probably restricted to simple weapons, short edged weapons, and firearms), so both of the only two approximate existing classes that would fit would need a retrofit. For future reference, those 2 classes from what I can find (if there's extra stuff I'm not considering, let me know) are the Psionic Warrior and the Shroud archetype of Marksman. Those are http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/psychic-warrior and http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/marksman/archetypes/dreamscarred-press/shroud respectively. The first would need to be modified to be more of a stealth class than a Fighter class like it is, and the second would need at least a stealthy Combat Style.

3, the iconic Ghost/Spectre loadout would need to be retrofitted for PF. The cloaking could (as an idea) be a function of the suit assisting the psionic cloaking to let him run a Concealing Amorpha with some minor Chameleon thrown in at will as long as it's undamaged (Tosh knows how to repair or make a new suit as needed, but this is NOT mid-field work) and maybe crank it up a notch when he needs to (by spending power points of course). The gun would be a bit of a bitch to work with, but not impossible (gun has armor penetration, does decent damage but can't be fired more than once a round even with FRA). The real problem would be the psionics from Starcraft. Several of his passive abilities could be translated to something similar to a psionic tattoo that doesn't dissipate (Spectres are supersoldiers, their origin government is willing to pay for quality), but what about something like Psionic Lash, or even Consumption?

Any thoughts on making this big lug a PF character would be greatly appreciated. Aside from the fun that would be playing this guy in a fight, he's also an interesting character as well, especially if someone were to take his Knight in Sour Armor tendencies as far as possible. Despite his lipservice to being disillusioned with humanity, he comes across as the kind of guy to go running towards screaming on instinct. A potentially fun dichotomy to play. His screwy relationship with Nova should also be a fun hook to yank on for any inventive DM.


__________________________________________

It was suggested that I migrate this to here, since Psionics isn't 1st Party in PF. Just one thing, in addition to the above.

I don't want his Spectre stuff as a PrC. He wasn't trained from preschool as a Rogue, he was trained as a Spectre.

All criticisms encouraged. I understand they're very strong and probably way overpowered, but I tried to make them as realistic as possible.

**Warforged**

**+2 to One Ability Score:** Warforged characters get a +2 bonus to one ability score of their choice at creation to represent their creator's purpose. 

**Varied Size:** At 1st level, a Warforged may choose to be a Small or Medium creature to reflect their creator's purpose. Small creatures gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a -1 penalty to their Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Medium
creatures have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Varied Speed:** A Small Warforged has a base speed of 20 feet. A Medium Warforged has a base speed of 30 feet.

**Warforged Immunities:** Warforged are immune to sleep effects, poison, disease and nausea, and gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against such effects. 

**Cyborg:** Warforged count as both Humanoid and Construct-type creatures for any effect that targets living creatures or constructs.

**Semi-organic:** Warforged only receive half the bonus from all heal effects (rounded down, minimum 1) and only take half damage (rounded down, minimum 1) dealt by negative energy. Spells and effects that repair damaged objects, such as *mending* or *make whole*, can also heal a Warforged but they receive only half the bonus from such effects (rounded down, minimum 1). A character can use the Craft (Construct) skill on a Warforged like they would the Heal skill on Humanoid creatures. Warforged may also benefit from the Heal skill.

**Built for Battle:** Warforged receive Toughness as a bonus feat at 1st level.

**Unnatural Presence:** Warforged receive a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate checks made against non-Warforged creatures.

**Bloodless:** Warforged are immune to bleeding. In addition, Warforged automatically stabilize below 0 hit points. 

**Always Armored:** Warforged are treated as always wearing light armor for the purpose of spells, effects and class restrictions.  Warforged receive a +1 Natural Armor bonus, a -1 Armor Check Penalty, and have a 5% Arcane Spell Failure Chance.

**Woodforged:** At 1st level, a Warforged may choose to forego the “Always Armored” racial feature for this feature instead. The Warforged is no longer treated as wearing armor for the purpose of spells, effects and class restrictions, and receives none of the bonuses or penalties. Instead, it receives a +2 bonus to Stealth when hiding in a wooded area or among wood.  In addition, it is considered combustible for the purpose of spells and effects.


EDIT: Unlisted negatives of being a warforged include poor healing rate and weakness to Electricity or Fire damage. A Woodforged is significantly more vulnerable than a Warforged since any stray fire could potentially kill it. A Warforged is restricted to certain classes since Monk, Druid, Sorcerer and Wizard take penalties for wearing armor, and it takes double Electricity damage, but this might not be a big enough weakness to balance a Warforged out.

EDIT 2: Took out the Energy Drain immunity. It seems pointless if they could be fatigued and exhausted but not energy drainable. Added Small Size option.

EDIT 3: Re-worded Semi-organic to match the appropriate wording, and made the effects of heal/neg energy spells round town to a minimum of 1 for consistency with PF mechanics

EDIT 4: Updated Semi-organic and Warforged Immunities to reflect their Humanoid-Construct nature.

&gt; (optional backstory below)

The idea is that the main heroes failed in their mission to defeat a great enemy. As a precaution, one of the heroes invented the first Warforged, living constructs designed after the heroes. Upon their deaths, a spell would awaken the Warforged and fight to avenge the heroes. With the heroes untimely demise, the Warforged awaken with only a limited memory of their creator(s) but plenty of battle instinct.

Except there's one thing I can't seem to figure out: Cool things to give to a fighter.

So, it's my understanding that Fighters are one of the more bland classes in Pathfinder. The fighter in our group is considering multi-classing at level 10, because he's getting pretty bored with Fighter, and they apparently don't get much more useful after level 10.

He has decent equipment including a spell-storing guisarme +1, and a dragons-bane longsword +1. He has a gem that absorbs up to 10 points of elemental damage per day. In terms of feats, they don't get used too often. He has a lot of feats that affect multiple targets, and he worked up to whirlwind, but he doesn't get to use it very often right now, at most once per session, sometimes once every other session.

For comparison, our Rogue has gotten roped into restoring the power of, basically, a god. In return, the god is granting him the ability to call on some neat abilities from a token that was given to the Rogue. Right now, the symbol has two abilities: flight, and very short-term pseudo-incorporeal form. The abilities are limited so as not to make him overpowered, but definitely help him provide more utility to the group.

The thing is, I'm not sure what I can give the Fighter to help him out. I've tried asking him, but he's sort of given up on Fighter... so he's not really interested in making Fighter more interesting through items or abilities that don't scale with his Fighter level.

So, some questions

* The sword he has is actually part of the story, and belonged to a powerful king from a long time ago. I can do something similar where he can restore it and gain abilities. What abilities would be interesting for a fighter?
* What existing items might be interesting/cool/useful treasures to plant for the fighter?
* What class choices pair well with a 10th level Fighter? He's not even sure what class to take at the moment, but just wants to be more useful to the group.
* What can I do in combats to help him feel more useful than just a damage dealer? I've thought about having certain areas that flood low HP, close-range, tightly packed units together so that the warrior can use whirlwind multiple times. What else might help him feel more useful?

Finally, the group is a Wizard, Cleric, Rogue, and Fighter. Also, the Wizard is mostly utility but always prepares two or three damage spells. At the moment, most of the damage is dealt by the Rogue.

Looking forward to the responses!

**TL;DR** Fighter is bored. Wants to multi-class... what classes pair well with 10th Fighter? What are cool items for fighters? What are cool spell-like abilities I can grant him through a home-brewed item? How can I help him feel more powerful in combat?

I took the rogue talent Bleeding Attack:

Bleeding Attack* (Ex): A rogue with this ability can cause living opponents to bleed by hitting them with a sneak attack. This attack causes the target to take 1 additional point of damage each round for each die of the rogue's sneak attack (e.g., 4d6 equals 4 points of bleed). Bleeding creatures take that amount of damage every round at the start of each of their turns. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 15 Heal check or the application of any effect that heals hit point damage. Bleeding damage from this ability does not stack with itself. Bleeding damage bypasses any damage reduction the creature might possess.

Now, I read the ability as applying the bleed effect in addition to dealing the usual Sneak Attack damage being that it refers to ""additional"" damage. Also, the other rogue talents that affect Sneak Attack are all clearly additional effects on top of the damage.

My DM disagrees, saying that the first sentence (""can cause"") implies that I have to choose to either apply the bleed or deal SA damage. He also believes that triggering the bleed and damage together would be greatly overpowered, but at lvl 6, 3 points per round doesn't seem excessive at all to me being that it doesn't stack, only applies when I can sneak attack and won't affect specific creature types.

I've done a pretty solid sweep through Google search results and couldn't find anything that says definitively one way or the other how it's applied, but most people reference the bleed as ""extra damage"" so I'm inclined to think that it's applied in addition to the normal SA damage.

I know that at the end of the day, it's up to my DM, but I figure having a crowd-sourced ruling is better than nothing in arguing my case.

So I am playing in a Pathfinder game and I've built an Aasimar Summoner. We are taking a hyper aggressive approach to leveling (basically 1 level every session) until we hit a certain point (I think level 10) and this is a blessing and a curse.

We played last night (we were at level 7) and it was the first time I've actually been able to get my Eidolon out for combat and work with it. During this fight I realized I had no friggin idea what I was doing. I haven't played much Pathfinder and I have not played as a pure caster in it before.

Basically, I could use as many tips as possible for Summoner play. Our game is a little tricky because it's not alignment forced. There are only 3 PCs left (a 4th may be coming) and the other 2 are evil. I am CN.

I've used my Summon Monster ability far more than my actual Eidolon because I've been playing the fact that I'm a Summoner pretty quietly. An engagement with a dragon last night made me throw that out the window, though.

I also have always had problems feeling like my Eidolon's stats are correct :/

What I'd like to do is write up as objective a description of what happened and what the three characters involved actions and motivations were, and then get your guys' opinions on what alignment their actions represented and why. The three characters are Sorcerer, Paladin, and Barbarian.


The three characters come upon a town that was attacked by bandits of a known gang affiliation(Crimson Thornes). They went to a town, and found some. After a little brawl(no blood shed) Sorcerer convinced these two bandits to renounce their gang, and lead them to their gangs hideout. The two bandits agreed, but were suddenly murdered by an assassins attack. Barbarian witnessed the assassin and could identify him.

Paladin, Sorcerer, and Barbarian chase after the assassin, barbarian catches up, and subdues him by injuring him. 

Barbarian tells the man he will release him in exchange for leading the group to the bandit camp(admittedly bluffing, plans to kill him the whole time because he knows he's a murderer).

Paladin tells the man he will release him in change for leading the group to the bandit camp. Whole heartedly plans to do this.

Sorcerer tells the man ""When I'm done with you, I'll let you go"" planning to force the man to lead the group to the door of the bandit leader's tent. Then release him inside the bandit camp, making no ruse of disguising who the group is or why they're here. Whole heartedly plans to go through with this.

The man agrees, and leads the group to where the bandit camp is. Barbarian grabs the man, wanting to break his legs, so he will be there when the group gets back.

Paladin gets angry, doesn't want this to happen, because he gave this man his word he'd let him go.

Sorcerer wants the man to lead them right to the door of the bandit camp.

Man begins to beg for his life.

Barbarian smashes the guy into the ground,breaking his back and killing him.

I decided I wanted to share an idea that popped up in my mind yesterday (before I read the post - pure coincidence there) and hopefully receive some feedback. I made a new self-post, as I figured that would get me a little more exposure as well as avoid hi-jacking the other thread.

Here's the general outline:

Players start with blank, base characters with only their race, gender qne possibly traits and ability scores (lower than usual) filled in. Depending on their background story, I will allow them to add some very basic feats or abilities (i.e. weapon proficiencies, cantrips of some kind, class skills)
Everything else has to be earned through role-playing.

Before a session, each player tells me what they will be trying to achieve for their character that session. If they succeed through good role-playing (or at least a good effort), I will reward them accordingly, by allowing them to add feats, skill(ranks), class abilities or an ability score increase.

Why do I want to try this? Because, while I think Pathfinder is quite awesome, I don't really like the restrictiveness of class-based systems. Pathfinder partly circumvents this through the use of archetypes, but I want to take it a step further.

I realise this is basically allowing players to create their own classes, using whatever combination of abilities, feats and traits I deem a logical combination, in accordance to how they role-played their character. This, along with the gradual character advancement, is what I think I will like best.

I will probably have to analyse all the classes and assign value points to their abilities so I have some sort of guideline to rule by. Alternatively, once such a point-value analysis is done, I can just give players character points to spend, while still requiring them to justify their choices. Also, I will still hand out experience points to keep track of overall character advancement. A lot of abilities will require a minimum XP (no 9th level spells during the 9th session). Maybe I can even ""fix"" the 'linear warrior, quadratic wizard' syndrome this way.

So, am I crazy in trying to undertake something like this using pathfinder as a base system? What do you think of the idea in general?

I've used a handful of online/digital tools for various RPGs over the years and have always been let down - either buggy or incomplete or unsupported or really difficult to use or not very full-featured etc.

Granted these were mostly free things that fans did in their spare time so maybe my expectations were a little high, but my experience has made me wary. I keep running across Hero Lab and I know it won an ENie a few years ago, but I can't quite justify $30.00 on a maybe.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses. The tl;dr of the comments seems to be that Hero Lab for Pathfinder is an excellent product and the more you play/DM Pathfinder the more worth it it becomes, however $30.00 only gets you the core rules. Depending on how many other source books you want access to it can cost as much as $150.

I really like the flavor of the class it adds an interesting set of abilities that could be handy for any Stealth like character. I am working on a Fetchling Ninja/Ranger/Shadow Dancer and need some advice about a certain ability. 
The one ability that I have a few questions on is 'Hide in plain sight'. For those of you that have never read this prestige class it states the following, ""A shadowdancer can use the Stealth skill even while being observed. As long as she is within 10 feet of an area of dim light, a shadowdancer can hide herself from view in the open without anything to actually hide behind. She cannot, however, hide in her own shadow"". 
My stealth score is a 27 and I took Fast stealth as a Ninja Trick so I may move at my full speed. Now if I am fighting in Dim lighting conditions or an area next to shadow could I technically Attack someone and then ""sulk"" with in the shadows immediately? In theory could I constantly become invisible after every attack if my stealth roll is high enough? Can I use stealth next to a creature and is stealth allowed around creatures with Darkvision? I read this ability and understand the basic mechanics but I feel like there is something I am missing here. I have read otherwise over the years but sometimes I feel like I get 3.5 information mixed with pathfinder stuff sometimes. Hey I played it for over a decade who wouldn't!

The group dynamic consisted of melee, melee, melee, spellcaster/melee. The logical decision was to choose something to fill a role that hasn't been filled, so I chose Rogue. Not just any rogue, though, but a Sniper. I thought it would be so cool to shoot things from hiding places for massive damage. I thought I could contribute to the party with my mountain of skill points. I was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO wrong.

First off, we haven't had an encounter where I can shoot from cover. I have had 0 places to hide for my sniping, so I've had a grand total of maybe 3 ranged sneak attacks because I acted fast enough for first round sneak attacks in 3 of the 5-7 encounters. Luckily I also carry a dagger, which gave me an additional 2-4 sneak attacks out of probably close to 50 attack rolls if not more. Even if I wanted to ambush the enemy, the rest of the group would blindly walk into combat without giving me a chance to assess the situation. One person blames it on taking the flaw ""whimsical."" That same person is an Adept Godling (didn't know 3rd party stuff would be allowed so I assumed no and went Rogue) who shoots magic missiles out of her greatsword. What happens when she doesn't have spells left? Greatsword. There's the fighter, which because he's a fighter he should do more consistent damage, so no complaints there except he likes to point out that I haven't done shit. There's the Inquisitor, who shares in my ""I'm so f***ing useless"" feeling since he apparently didn't specialize enough. And lastly there's the Cavalier, who this session maxed his damage to 120 on a crit, and deals a solid 15-20 damage per hit. What do I do most of the time? 1d6+1 (composite +1 shortbow) or 1d4+2 (dagger).

Level 9, though we level arbitrarily to keep it interesting, and the most damage I've done in 1 round is 32 (almost maxed damage on SA dice), though I shouldn't have gotten my SA dice since you can't SA an ooze, but I wasn't about to tell my GM that. I got to feel useful, I wasn't going to give that up. Then there's the fact that I should have died but he pitied me so much that he was more than likely doing min damage just to avoid killing the last hope in my character. I wouldn't have minded having my character die. It's a learning experience. I would've gone back and tried something completely different, like the 2-handed Ranger I was going to be originally. But he continues to put my rogue on life support.

Oh, and what about those skills that I piled on my character? out of the 117 skill ranks (those of you doing the math, that's 8 for rogue, 3 for int cause I wanted Focused Shot, 1 for Human, and 1 for fav class bonus) I've been able to utilize about 23. Perception, Stealth (like 3 times), and Knowledge (I loop all the knowledges that I know that I've used, which is like 3). 23 out of 117... What have I done?

I know I'm just whining, I built this character with a goal in mind and it doesn't fit the campaign I'm in, but I'm tired of holding this back and I needed to rant about this somewhere to get it off my mind. Thank you for listening.

PS: I won't be leaving them because despite the fact that my character can't do anything, it's still fun to hang out with those guys, and I probably never would've hung out with them otherwise.

I was also able to craft a story where players got to play their characters in flashbacks. I found this easier to do because I had written the story of each character into the larger plot from the moment of their birth up until the player started playing them. This level of detail allowed me to create some intricate plot twists. I am not saying this is impossible to do when a player creates their own character, but it is certainly easier if you have full control.

My initial idea was she was going to be an adopted half-elf of a human Sandpoint family. Then I would take the Adopted trait and Family Ties from the Rise of the Runelords player guide.

Her adopted father would be a craftsman that taught her his skills now she's a bowyer and weapon crafter. She's made her own bow and practices when she's not crafting.

We're almost done with the first chapter of RotRL and the idea was at the end of this chapter the current adventurers would disperse and then a month or two (in game time) would elapse and a new group would need to come to help the town. My thoughts were when the original adventurers didn't come (because we're all rolling new characters) she would step up and help defend the town.

But I'm curious about a few things. Why did she step up now? I'm iffy on her fitting into the town or not. She's got a low charisma so she probably wouldn't fit in so why step up?

I do want her to be chaotic good. I want her to help others based on what she thinks is right. 

I want her skills to fit into her backstory also. If I didn't make her a crafter what about a traveler. Not necessarily an adventurer but someone that could step up to help. So maybe ride and climb, and acrobatics. But I've talked to the GM and he said there wouldn't be much need for Ride in what we're doing. Perhaps Perception. (I know perception and acrobatics aren't class skills).

Or suggestions for something better? I'm not a creative writer.

**Background:** We're part way through the second book of a kingmaker campaign. My old character was a halfling bard (archivist) ""archaeologist"", and though beastly out of combat he was very lacklustre in battle. I got bored and my DM agreed to retire the bard to a role as an NPC adviser to the realm and roll up something new.

What I went with was a Human cavalier (Order of the Cockatrice). STR 18, DEX 13, CON 12, INT 10, WIS 8, CHA 14. For feats I went Mounted Combat, Ride-By-Attack, Spirited Charge, Wheeling Charge, Power Attack, Precise Strike (teamwork).

My cavalier, by comparison, does 3d8+27 on the charge. If it's against his challenge target it's 3d8+45 (or 51 if he's the only one threatening). That's a charging Power Attack one-handed with his lance (DM ruled lances can't be used two-handed while mounted). Off the horse he deals 2d6+12 power attacking with his Greatsword.

I guess it's silly to deny that my character is pretty min-maxed. It's not as min-maxed as I could possibly make it, for sure, but the combination of a medium-sized cavalier in a Kingmaker campaign is pretty deadly. Adventuring days are so short that I can challenge at least once every combat, so my damage can keep up with the min-maxy fighter (who people grumble about a bit as it is). The open terrain means that it's rare his mount can't be brought to bear. And every one of his feats is geared towards grinding as much benefit out of that advantage as possible.

That said, I don't want to be seen as the player trying to steal the show, and just stomping all the encounters on my own. It sorta makes matters worse that my character (Order of the Cockatrice...) is trying to do exactly that. 

So...what do I do? Right now my thought is to burn more actions on things like Tactician and Dazzling Display, buffing my allies and debuffing enemies to make everyone else hit harder. I'm also going to drop my greatsword for off-horse combat and focus on sword-and-boarding with my longsword (it helps that my DM has collapsed some of the feat requirements for doing so, to make non-THF builds more palatable).

I'm going to be DMing a one-shot Christmas adventure with my group in two weeks, and thought a CR 20 encounter with good ol' St. Nick would be an appropriate climax. Think the fantasy equivalent of Robot Santa from Futurama. Unfortunately, I can't think of a good way to build Santa and make him both thematically coherent and actually a good challenge. Anyone who wants to throw me some ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Here's what I've considered so far:

1. Inquisitor: What does Santa do? He *judges* whether you're naughty or nice, and overly zealously good Santa is going to smite your ass. The thing that bugs me is that this is going to be a many on one fight, and all the Inquisitor's teamwork feats are kind of wasted.

2. Cleric of some sort: This seems like a very good fit, but the obvious domains (artifice or good or law) don't feel like they would increase the challenge for my players.

3. Druid with a reindeer companion: I can't find a reindeer in Bestiary, and the wildshaping isn't very Santa-y.

4. Ranger with a reindeer companion: same as the above, and the Ranger is far less magical than I would consider him to be.

5. Paladin: The Smiting's good, but the magic isn't and Santa doesn't seem all that heavily armed.

6. A wizard? I dunno about this one. My gut is against it, but it makes sense that Santa would be a Transmutation or divination wizard.

One of the asshole pirates? He *might* have cut off a finger and an ear off my character for being mouthy. 

Basically, GM was playing Scourge and blahblah doing a *great* job of being a dick, so I muttered something insulting about his dick size to another PC...unfortunately the GM decided Courge heard that, and had my character tied up and thrown overboard and dragged along for a bit.

The problem came from me making all the checks and not suffering/starting to drown when I was supposed to. GM had her thrown in five times...no go.  So in order to get the ""Don't fuck with the NPC's"" message through, he cut off one of her ears. 

No big deals, ears aren't necessary. What's an actual issue is that I *continued being mouthy* so he had a finger cut off. 

I'm a goddamned sorcerer and we're low level, so *all my spells have somatic components, shithead*.  

Now I have a spell failure chance until I get the stupid finger back, but the goddamned cleric quit the campaign. 

The GM said he'll work with me in-game to find an object/potion/random healer to give me back my finger, and our next stop is some abandoned island where we find a boat? (We've seen it ""in the distance"" and Plugg has decided the party has to crew it to sail it back somewhere safer, that starts next session). 

What could I reasonably find on an abandoned island/ship that could heal my stupid finger? 

TL; DR: I shouldn't play Pathfinder while drunk. i rolled too well, smarted off too much, and  lost my goddamned finger.

Edit: To make it clear, the cleric completely quit the campaign after the finger session was completely over. If we'd known he wasn't going to be coming back, we'd have continued the session long enough to re-attach my finger.

In the Tieflenwald Forest, a Wicked Witch has cast an evil spell and unleashed terrible monsters upon the countryside.

But now a few players are MIA for personal reasons and the rest of the group would get slaughtered in Jorgenfist, and I don't want to water down the encounters - it's supposed to be the chapter finale after all.

So I, with the remaining players, meta-decided that they would investigate a Shoanti subplot I introduced a while ago:

The players got a hint from a shopkeeper they know that he'd pay their weight in gold for a specific Shoanti artifact if they'd deliver it to him. After that the players encountered a group of Shoanti from the Shundar-Quah tribe who asked for the same artifact, because they believe it can be used to unite the Shoanti people to a single tribe once again.

Long story short, the players found the artifact (A non-magical ancient human skull) and after a heated discussion took the high road and returned it to the Shoanti.

This is the part I need ideas and help for. I've got some notes with no cohesive plot:

The players need to convince leaders of Shoanti tribes that they're worthy of pursuing the quest further. Perhaps with trials of some sort, one for each Shoanti tribe? If they succeed, they get a few NPCs of that tribe helping them too many failures and the Shoanti quorum won't let them near the dungeon.

The skull is a clockwork item used to open the dungeon of a great Shoanti leader from the times of the Runelords.

The dungeon itself is either a grave or a jail. I haven't really decided yet. One solution would be to have the Great Leader be in some kind of stasis, ready to be woken up when the Runelords need him to lead their old slave caste once more.
Another would be to have him be dead, but have some inspiring texts and writings aid the Shoanti to re-unite.

In the dungeon the first levels before the skull-locked door would be just generic desert dwelling monsters appropriate for the player levels.

For the finale I thought Terracotta Soldiers would be appropriate. Maybe accompanied/led by a bigger monster of some sort - or the Great Leader him/herself undead or alive.

I still need traps other non-combat encounters.

My current interpretation is that once the PC ends his movement within 30 ft of the NPC, the NPC can spot him without a roll because he is now perceiving the PC with one of his senses, sight.


EDIT: End result is it is official that being able to see 30 ft in dim light does not equate to a DC 0 sight check to see something within that 30 ft.

The game is very open world. With no real guiding story, the story that is there, the DM let us know he's TOTALLY fine with us just abandoning it.

Anyway. I'm playing a Tiefling Sorcerer. Alignment is Lawful Neutral, with Evil tendencies. His backstory, is that he was a former Infernal Duke in the Eighth Circle of Hell, a lore and records keeper for Mephistopheles. He was exiled from Hell after some conspiracies and whatnot, the others (Aside from Asmodeus) were jealous and concerned because my characters knows more than anyone about Hell and it's business, except for Asmodeus himself. They conspired, he fled. Now on the Material Plane.

My sorcerer always wears a Hat of Disguise to make himself appear Human. Wears a black pinstripe suit, red shirt, with black tie. 

**WHERE I NEED ASSISTANCE** is with playing a neutral/evil character. A lawful one at that. After being on the Material Plane for awhile, he grew a bit soft. But mostly on the ""I don't murder children"" front. But I have no idea how to play a more evil inclined character. Chaotic Evil is easier, but Lawful Evil? And at the same time, trying to keep party cohesion. Also most of his strengths are involving role-playing elements. High CHA with high Bluff and Diplomacy, Sense Motive, etc.

**EDIT:** He prefers to avoid combat, but doesn't shy away from destroying people with his power if it comes to it. Killing can be good for business. BEING killed hurts business even more.

- Broke Scourge's wrists on two separate occasions  
- Fired a dart into one of Scourge's broken wrists  
- Made Scourge's whip sound positively silly instead of the whip's usual crack!  
- Impersonated every officer to every other officer, leading to mass confusion  
- Violently abused four crew members while impersonating various officers, including the captain  
- The entire crew now believes Scourge and the captain spend all night as lovers  
- Scourge has been seen walking around wearing makeup on two separate occasions  
- The entire crew believes the ship is haunted due to all the unexplained shenanigans, and...  
- Literally summoned ghosts as the ship's cleric tried to downplay it (the superstitious crew is now in a frenzy about the hauntings)  
- Spent a week in-game fooling around, half-heartedly attempting to steal back our gear, exhausting the officers by having them keep a close eye on us and constantly ""thwart"" our ""plans""... only to have the quartermaster give us our gear as part of a deal.  
- Befriended Owlbear, the huge grizzled thug, and turned him into somewhat of a shy, cuddly pacifist.  
- Killed the cook, made it look like an accident. Ghosts blamed.  
- Stole most of the medicine and medical supplies.  
- Continually demonstrate a total disregard for the ship's rules and a complete incompetency in the general life of a pirate... and then outperform the seasoned crew at tasks, every time.  
- Nearly every day, all meals have been some form of bacon or pork, despite there being no apparent pigs on board.  
- As a result of the nonstop pork, the crew is starting to believe that there is a Portal to the Plane of Elemental Bacon onboard the ship, and is also possibly letting in the ghosts. They are very upset about this but can't bring themselves to actually confront any of the officers about it, because it sounds ridiculous.  
- My artificer created Rainbow Ratchucks -- nunchucks made out of rats and able to trigger the Color Spray spell effect. He's constantly showing them off, much to the great confusion of the crew. He routinely dares people to call him crazy while expertly whirling the brightly-colored implements around. They want to so, so badly... but who would honestly mess with a guy swinging magical rainbow rats around?  
- Rode a pig around the ship making pork puns. (Note again that there were apparently no pigs on this ship.)  
- Waging extremely unnecessary psychological warfare on the crew by alternating irrational threatening behavior towards them one hour, and then sweet, friendly behavior towards them the next. They're starting to learn that only if they are nice to us are they left in peace.

Since wizards do more impressive things than normal people, I wanted more impressive servants for my potential wizard school, so I was looking at how to create simulacrum as servants (I'll have to wait until level 13, but that's fine).  I couldn't find a solid rule about what spell-like abilities the simulacra get - in fact, the only thing I could find related to it was the universal monster rules about [spell-like abilities](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-):

&gt;For creatures with spell-like abilities, a designated caster level defines how difficult it is to dispel their spell-like effects and to define any level-dependent variables (such as range and duration) the abilities might have. The creature’s caster level never affects which spell-like abilities the creature has; sometimes the given caster level is lower than the level a spellcasting character would need to cast the spell of the same name. If no caster level is specified, the caster level is equal to the creature’s Hit Dice. The saving throw (if any) against a spell-like ability is 10 + the level of the spell the ability resembles or duplicates + the creature’s Charisma modifier.

So the reduced hit-dice of the simulacrum doesn't appear to impact what spell-like abilities the simulacrum would have.

My questions are these, given those rules:

A simulacrum of a [Solar](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/angel/solar) (22hd creature, 11hd simulacrum)

* can it use wish 1/day?
* if i give it a mundane composite longbow, would it still be able to use its Slaying Arrow abilitiy?
* could I use its at-will animate objects to Permanency some constructs?
* given the limitations of [Wish](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/wish), particularly its ability to replicate 8th or lower wizard spells and handle up to 10,000 gp of material components, could I wish for more simulacra?  The Solar simulacrum cost 5,500 gp to create, for reference.

EDIT:

* would the solar's regeneration restore hit points and damage caused to the simulacrum?  usually this can only be repaired in a lab for 100 gp per hit point

EDIT 2:
To be clear, this is mostly a thought exercise.  In my game, I am not going to make simulacra that can impact how easy the game is for the party - my simulacra will purely be for flavor to add to my wizard school.  However, I want to see if my interpretation of the spell was incorrect or if it is as potentially game-breaking as I suspect it is.

Also, I put together a solar simulacrum for reference in hero lab:

I am in a campaign were there is a undead apocalypse. So far we have seen zombies and a vampire (main villain).  The zombies are somehow tracking my character specifically in the group, at a distance. The Vampire is also following our movement with bats.

I am a lvl 6 Chaotic Neutral Halfling Ranger with the Trapper archetype. Our party includes a Paladin and a Monk. I focus on stealth, use a sling and have the following equipment: 
wrist sheath,
cloak of elvenkind,
Shadow Leather Armour,
halfling sling staff,
sling

Questions:
What are possible ways he is tracking me? Detect Chaotic?
How can I better hide myself?
DM has stated he has something planned to screw my character, what should i look out for with a vampire?
How best can I hurt the vampire. I am currently planning on getting all the Fire traps (Fire Trap, Burning trap, and exploding Trap.)

Familiars gain hit dice. Number of hit dice is equal to the caster's appropriate class level (or the familiar's normal HD total, whichever is higher). A familiar's *actual hitpoint total*, however, is half the caster's HP total.

Familiars gain new abilities at caster levels 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13; other odd levels are strangely absent (indicating to me that these abilities do *not* represent abilities that the familiar is ""buying"" with new feat slots).

Familiars have certainly got sufficient intelligence (starts at 6 and reaches 15 by 20th level). 

Familiars do *not* get their own skill ranks. They use either their base animal skill ranks or the master's, whichever is better (using their own bonuses and modifiers).

There do exist some feats with odd wording: [Evolved Familiar](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/evolved-familiar), for example, is clearly for the caster due to the way that it refers to ""your familiar"" and that in the case of changing familiar, the old familiar loses the bonuses and the caster may apply it to their new familiar. However, other feats like [Critical Conduit](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/critical-conduit), [Familiar Focus](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/familiar-focus), and [Spell Sponge](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/spell-sponge) are worded completely differently, both in effect and listed prerequisites, making me think that they are taken by the actual familiar rather than the master.

I'm not sure what traits would fit him, as I'm not overly familiar with PF. I've only recently moved back to where this GM is and when I left they were doing 4E.

During an ensuing fight, one of our npc's that had rescued us from a dungeon fell unconscious. An enemy next to him goes for a coup de grace and I paladin sacrifice to take the blow. There was much debate afterwards whether I would just take the damage and move on or whether the coup de grace affect would affect me as well. The spell reads that I get resistances and immunities which allowed me to argue that because I was not helpless than I would be immune to a coup de grace effect. After much arguing it was decided we would treat it exactly like as if I was helpless. He rolled a 29 in damage and I needed a 39 fort save to survive but fell short at a 28 fort save. So my life ended. 

Was just curious as to whether anyone else has encountered a similar situation or if they know the exact rules pertaining to this situation. My character is now dead and I hold no resentment over the fact because he went out in true Paladin fashion but just wanted to see for future games what the ruling would be.

Half-Orc
City Raised - Proficiency with Longsword and Whip instead of Weapon Familiarity

Feats:

Level 1 - Dodge

Fighter 1 - Mobility

Fighter 2 - Spring Attack (Retrain at level 4)

Level 3 - Combat Expertise

Fighter 4 - Whirlwind

Level 5 - Enforcer

Thug 1(lvl5) - Enemies shaken by Demoralize for more than 4 rounds become Frightened

Thug 2(lvl6) - Evasion, Rogue Talent - Weapon Focus (Whip)

Level 7, Fighter 5 - Whip Mastery, Weapon Training (Whip)

And... I guess I'll go into two-weapon fighting or power attacking here for when we're fighting fewer enemies.  Scorpion Whips and Whip Mastery are pretty good for getting around all the downsides of whips.  Alternatively, I could go into improved -&gt; greater trip for all the OAs.

If I took Lore Warden, I'd be able to get Combat Expertise at 2 for free and pick up Whip Mastery faster... at the cost of my armor proficiency and armor training.  

The build's crazy feat-intensive (so much so that I don't know if I could even do the TWF chain after this), and I'm basically playing a weak Fighter until level 4.  I also don't have the best saves.  The idea is to stay behind the rest of the party, preferably enlarged, and provide support fire/debuffing/combat maneuvers from the back line.
