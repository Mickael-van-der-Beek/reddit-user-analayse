The game is called ""Dysfunctional Systems: Learning to Manage Chaos"", and it's the first episode in a series of 5. It's a story-based game, so there's no real interaction other than making some choices for the main character. You can read more about it on the official site: http://dysfunctionalsystems.com/

We also made a short and free game last year of a similar type. It has no choices though, you just sit back and enjoy the story. You can find that one here: http://junipersknot.dischan.org/

Thanks for you time! I'll be around for a few hours, so if you have any questions for me, feel free to ask!

We were sick of the constant overtime, of dumbing down our games for the non-existent ""average gamer"", and of someone else reaping all the rewards, while the team got the sack. We wanted to make games that we felt were meaningful and in genres that actually interest us.

We've had some savings, a good deal of experience and contacts, and a clear idea on what we want to do. What could go wrong?

Our first VN, [a mature retelling of Cinderella with heavy emphasis on choices and shaping the story](http://moacube.com/games/cinders/), was supposed to take around half a year to complete. That's what our savings allowed us for, with maybe a tiny buffer. Between [some production trouble](http://moacube.com/blog/cinders-postmortem-2-production-and-business/) and our own perfectionism, it took a year and a half.

We've had to stretch *really* thin to make it. I still remember having to decide between paying the rent and the electricity bill, pondering if they'll cut my power off before they will throw me out of my apartment, and if I can still finish the game then. Today, it's just a funny story I tell to my friends when we go out for a beer. But back then -- holy shit was I stressed!

Still, we've somehow made it through, living like ascetics and borrowing money from friends and family. Cinders eventually came out! 

It wasn't a huge hit or anything, but it gathered [a lot of good press](http://moacube.com/news/what-the-press-says-about-cinders/) and -- most importantly -- the players liked it. It was enough to get us out of our debts and secure some profit. We actually started living off doing what we love!

It's been a year since the release now, and we're still making a humble-but-steady living from the sales of our games. In this time, I was able to release another smaller title and make significant progress on our next VN. If we're persistent, the future ahead looks quite bright :).

So, why am I writing this? 

I hope that our story will serve as an inspiration for some of you. Becoming a full-time indie developer is hard as hell, especially if you are into something as niche as VNs, but the rewards are *so* worth it. If you believe you have something really special -- keep at it. Even (or especially) when things get rough. If it fails, you can always get back to your old life. But you will hate yourself forever if you don't even try :).

I would also like to voice my thanks to the visual novel community. At first, we were very afraid that our game is going to be rejected by the VN fans. After all, we were a completely new face and Cinders doesn't follow the anime conventions in both art and writing. We were wrong. The community proved to be really welcoming, open to trying out something new, and willing to share their knowledge and feedback. In fact, I don't think I've ever met a gaming community as friendly as this one in my seven years of game development.

Thanks, people! We wouldn't make it without you :). ",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,1372683224.0,,,True,t3_1hf8j3,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1hf8j3/its_been_a_year_since_i_started_living_off_indie/,

I made a custom patch for FSN which changes the in-game BGM to the soundtrack reproduction released late last year ( http://www.aniplex.co.jp/staynight/ ). It's essentially the same but its arrangement is better. Made it mostly for myself so I can re-read the novel with a slightly different feel to it, but I certainly don't mind sharing it with everyone.


You can download the patch here: 

[MEGA](https://mega.co.nz/#!q55wULAJ!AtIL2SH5GUl04d2vThsKwlXy5cpHSWrwAK5VDXH668k)

[RAR archive for checking the integrity](https://mega.co.nz/#!zoRmCLzA!dJNea2Dh3tZ5ZZP39KVrynl-QmFhFmT5UljWeL4wsYY)

I understand file-sharing services are bad, but I don't have any other means to share it with you right now.


Simply place the file into your FSN root directory and it should work. I tested the patch with the latest Realta Nua patch (4.2) and latest mirror-moon translation patch (3.2 I think. All these patches are so confusing lol). If you don't like it, just delete the file from the game folder.


Known issue: seems like there is a problem with the in-game vorbis decoder, all the .ogg bgm files skip a couple hundred ms forward at the beginning, which causes looping to be a little off. I don't really know how to fix that, I'm not that savvy with all the technical stuff, but this problem is not hugely impactful anyway.


I am also not really knowledgeable about the legal stuff, but I'm pret-t-ty sure this little thing I did is illegal, since, well, I share something released on a CD. Download and use it at your own risk.


Some other notes/concerns from the thread:
If the latest patch you have in your game folder is lower or higher than patch8 (i.e. patch7.xp3; patch6.xp3; patch9.xp3), you need to rename this file to the patch with the next highest number (i.e. patch8.xp3; patch7.xp3; patch10.xp3 respectively if we take the previous example)",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,1364971537.0,,,True,t3_1bibnq,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1bibnq/custom_patch_for_fatestay_night_which_changes/,

And now that there's enough of a community to merit a subreddit, why don't we do just that?


Here's how I see it working. We select a VN to read by vote. We all read or reread it as a group. There's a weekly discussion thread, posted by someone who's already read the novel and can break it down into smaller pieces for discussion. Pretty simple stuff.


If we're reading as a group, we'd have to decide which routes and decisions to take, which'd take away some of the charm of VNs.


Thoughts?


**EDIT**: It appears that there are four main concerns:

- Enforced playing order kinda sucks
- People need enough time to read
- The VN we ultimately pick shouldn't be too long
- Discussing one VN for too long will disinterest fast readers


For the first point: why don't we pick a linear VN to start out with? That gets rid of the first problem, albeit temporarily.

For the second and fourth points: whoever is 'running the discussion' should have read the VN once before and figure out how best divide the VN into reasonable lengths for discussion. I think frequent threads will keep people's interest longer. Biweekly might be a good compromise between frequency and giving people a chance to catch up. Some VNs are naturally very episodic, and lend themselves well to this sort of approach.


The third point: I agree completely. Even though I love CLANNAD to death.


I propose we choose from the following. If we ever get around to actually doing this, I can make another thread and we can decide via upvotes.

Now we need to find someone who has read Planetarian to take a leadership roll in deciding how to split up the game. Additionally we need to decide as a group how quickly we want to go through the VN. Planetarian is a short VN (2-10 hours).

Thoughts? Volunteers to decide how to split up the VN and lead discussions?

Edit: Another thing we have to decide is how often people want to have an organized discussion about the VN and when.

Edit 2: The general consensus seems to be we all play through it and have a discussion afterwards on a specified date, probably 2 weeks into the future. What day of the week and time of day would work best for everyone?

**Edit 3: Unless there are any objections I would like to set a tentative discussion time of Sunday afternoon, June 10th.**

I hope that this will allow people to explain their choices. I also hope that people will respect everyone else's opinions and not judge them much about their choices. Also, try to keep spoilers to a minimum. You're explanations don't need to be as long as mine.


To start it off, I'll give my top 5 and the reasons that their in my top 5.


**Fifth**: Utawarerumono - I played this game a while after I watched the anime and sadly, it was almost exactly like the anime. That's not too bad of a thing considering the anime was amazing, but it was slightly sad considering I knew the whole story already. You're basically a man with amnesia that wakes up somewhere and gets involved with them leading you to some great adventures, to be vague lol. The drawing was amazing and the character sprites were also great. The battle system that was incorporated was also a great addition that added to the fun. The graphics were great, but I wish that the story was not linear. If only it branched at places to give more variety... but oh well. It was good despite that. Get it if you want some fun with a great story and you don't mind it being a linear story.


**Fourth**: Sengoku Rance - Rance is actually a big series by AliceSoft. Sengoku Rance is the 7th game in the Rance series if you don't count the what-if game Kichikuō Rance or the side games with the fourth Rance game. This game is amazing both in its system and its story. You're basically a foreigner that gets control of one territory in Japan and try to take over all of Japan. I love this game because it has a good amount of comedy and ero in it with battles. I involves a lot of strategy because there are many territories that you must deal with. The battle system is simple to understand, but you have to actually plan ahead for attacks that may come later and how capturing some people or doing some side-quests may effect how hard the final battles are. The story is good, the ero is good, the drawing is amazing, the sprites are amazing, the scenario is great, and the music is also great. Although there is basically one general story that ends up coming to pass, anything can happen along the way through the story. I love that it's so varied and requires thinking rather than just clicking, like some battle systems are (ex. Koihime Musou battles, although they weren't really the point of the game and were put there as extra rather than being the point of the game like Rance). The Rance games all build up on each other which gives the Rance series a great appeal. I'm especially looking forward to the next installment Rance Quest. I can't wait until the English version of it comes out or an English patch.


**Third**: Clannad - For some reason, I kept putting this visual novel off. I thought it was being overrated and kept on moving it down my list as I found other visual novels to play. I just finished it recently and... I hate myself for moving it around. This visual novel is AMAZING. A few of the routes are not that great but the majority of them are just fantastic. This is one of the few visual novels where I can say ""I cried so much"" and not care if anyone judges me because it was just that amazing. I especially loved Kotori's route and ending T_T. After Story was an amazing addition as well and I love that they had it included in there. I heard about the Tomoyo After visual novel for this as well and I can't wait until the English translation is finished. Clannad has great replay value because the stories are just so moving and the characters are brought out so well that you feel so connected to them. You can see yourself grow as a person through interactions with each of the heroines and your best friend. There's a reason many people recommend this visual novel, ITS AMAZING!


**Second**: Muv-Luv Series - I started this visual novel because people kept saying how great it was, how amazing it looked, and how it was the top of the list in VNDB. I was a little dubious since I didn't think that it could be THAT amazing. Boy was I wrong. To be honest, Muv-Luv wasn't that AMAZING. It was just another high school drama type visual novel that has a few heroines to choose from etc. One thing I can say about it is that the stories for each of the heroines were actually pretty good. I felt drawn in to the story. I finished it giving it a thumbs up despite the typical high school scenario and moved on to Muv-Luv Unlimited. Now to tell you the truth, I read some of the Unlimited and Alternative manga, so I knew the gist of what this was about. Muv-Luv Unlimited turned out to be very good. It was well written had a good story and brought a lot of excitement. I only read some of the manga so up to a point, I knew what was going on, then everything from then on was a great surprise. The story was set well, but the thing that brought it down for me was the branched endings. The fact that you could go for different heroines at the end just seemed too hastily put together. All you have to do is change the person you think about at a point already close to the end and you get their ending. And each of their endings are the same. It makes it sorta disappointing to have those branches only for them to be the same stuff. The original Muv-Luv did better on that point than Unlimited did imo. Once I finished that, I went on to Muv-Luv Alternative, the one that everyone was going crazy about. When I started it and watched the opening to the start menu, I was awed. I LOVED the [opening video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVtKXauXEJQ) especially the song ""Asu e no Houkou"" which I have since listened to countless times. Needless to say, this was a great beginning to my impression of the visual novel. The title menu even had great music with it. Once I started the visual novel, I noticed some key differences between it and its predecessors. The camera had different angles of places that I have since become familiar with which added to the atmosphere. The text was not in a big box that covered 1/3 of the screen. It was just there floating on the image in differing colors for different characters that actually worked pretty well with the backgrounds. I never thought that it was hard to read at any point. It was a good start. Once I started it, I couldn't stop. I ended Unlimited at 3am. I started Alternative and played from 3am to the 6am of the next day. I had been awake for 44 hours. My eyes and head hurt, but I loved it so much that I continued. The only reason that I didn't continue after  6am is because I made the fatal mistake of laying down while playing it instead of sitting up like I had been for the whole time and fell asleep because I was too comfortable. The story was probably the best thing I've read. It was amazing and I don't think I'll find another like it. After playing it, I couldn't play another VN for a while because they just didn't seem as good after playing Alternative. The story was better than anything I could have asked for and it gave me ALL THE FEELS. I love it when characters grow. And the main character Shirogane Takeru, grew like no other in his journey between the 3 games. That was part of the reason that I loved it. All the difficulties he's faced, all the demons he's had to conquer, all the tragedies he's had to endure, all of it made him a better person. That said, I was slightly unsatisfied by the ending, [](/s ""the fact that he returns to his world with none of his memories or abilities which basically disregards all the progress that he's made on this journey kinda makes me mad although I understand that he's not in the other world anymore so none of that is necessary for the peaceful world he lives in now. Still, I wish that all that character growth didn't just disappear..."") If anything, I wish that they could have made it have a few different endings that could happen. But despite that, it was one of the greatest visual novels I've read and I can see how it earned the #1 spot on VNDB. There's no doubt in my mind that you must play this because you'll love it. GET IT!


After talking about all that, you're probably wondering what is better than this to be #1. It isn't exactly BETTER, but it holds a special place in my heart which bumps it up to #1.


**First**: Fate/Stay Night - This was the third visual novel I played after Brass Restoration and Farland Symphony. I was just starting out and found this beauty. This is what made me so passionate about visual novels. The stories were amazing. When I finished the Fate route, I was conflicted because it was such a great game that I was sad that it already ended. Then the screen says ""Start again from Day 3"" and what do we have here? The Unlimited Blade Works route, which by the way is my favorite. Not only were the stories great, the drawing was great as well. I loved the expressions that the characters would have and the character sprites themselves. Is it weird that I focused on the fingers when I think of the art? I just love the way their fingers look in this game... yeah I know I'm weird. I can't tell you how many times I've played all the routes over and over again because I just can't get enough of it's story. I played it again recently when I got the Realta Nua version with extra CGs and voice overs. I was so happy and it made it a new experience again to play. I loved that atmosphere that the visual novel made. In each of the routes, you can see how much the characters struggle with themselves and each other. The characters are flushed out well which adds to how much I like this game. This game was the game that brought me into the world of visual novels, has amazing replay value because the story is just great, and has a special place in my heart. GET IT. Especially the Realta Nua version because I love the voice acting for it.",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,False,,,True,t3_xol47,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/xol47/your_top_5_visual_novels/,

&gt;    Osaka, June 10 (Jiji Press)--A man was arrested in Osaka, western Japan, Sunday over an apparent indiscriminate stabbing that killed two people.
   The suspect, identified as Kyozo Isohi, 36, told investigators that he is not acquainted with the victims, according to the Osaka prefectural police department.
   Isohi also told investigators that he thought he would kill anyone no matter who they are, according to sources familiar with the investigation.
   The incident happened in the busy Higashishinsaibashi district at around 1 p.m. (4 a.m. GMT) when the two victims, a man and a woman, were sent to hospital after being stabbed several times, according to the police department.
   The male victim is apparently Shingo Minamino, a 42-year-old resident of Higashikurume, Tokyo, according to the driver's license. The female victim is in her 60s.

&gt; According to Mainichi News, Minamino Shingo, the music producer of Nitro+, was killed by a random slasher in Osaka. A 36 year old jobless man was arrested for killing Minamino and a woman. The killer deposed to the police that he was just released from the prison last month and was not acquainted with the victims. Minamino was attacked on the way to a live concert of Nitro+’s music label. The killer stabbed Minamino 20 - 30 times in the middle of the busy street in Osaka and attacked an elderly woman riding a bicycle nearby. He returned to Minamino, who fell on the street, and stabbed Minamino again straddling him.
Minamino's twitter account
Minamino is the representative of Nitro+’s music label Georide, which Ito Kanako and Nitro+’s character Super Sonico belong to.

The last time a lot of you saw me, it was here, at /r/VisualNovels. I had come up with the not-so-original idea to create a totally free Visual Novel, with only the help of non-profit volunteers from reddit.

Surprisingly, we're still going strong.

However, like a band at concert, we feed off of our community's energy. And right now, our community is pretty small. We'd love to have more fellow VN enthusiasts (maybe even other creators?) follow our work. After all, your demand is required for our supply.

Much has changed since that initial post. We now have a full-blown team of wonderful volunteers, who have given up a considerable amount of their free time to creating something beautiful with me.

So far, we have made considerable progress, considering where we started just a while ago.

We've decided to make it a Murder Mystery VN. So if you like solving mysteries, this one is for you! I can't give any more details now, because spoilers.

There will be ladies. An unknown amount right now, but we're planning on between 4 and 6.

We currently have our own subreddit! If it's something you'd be interested in, please check out /r/alienworks, and follow our progress! Plus, you'll be privy to early info and sneak peaks (character concept art, music samples, etc.).

And, as a mac user, I was always dismayed by the lack of VNs for the system (I know, I know, I know. Macs. But hindsight is 20/20). As a result, we're shooting to release the game on both Mac and PC. So we're showing the Mac users some love.

Anyways, so ends my desperate ploy for your love and attention. Please! Ask questions! I'll answer them here. And please, consider following our progress, because truly, we're doing it for you!",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,False,,vndev,True,t3_1272rz,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1272rz/remember_us_were_making_a_free_vn_for_you_still/,

However, the two seem to be closely linked. Anyhow, I'm just asking because although I've read a fair amount of visual novels, I haven't actually played a full on proper ""dating sim"". You know like the ones that are always referenced in anime and other visual novels. Like where they joke about hitting the correct ""flags"" to get the girl and making sure your ""stats"" are a high enough level. I'm really curious to try one of these games out. So could you guys give some recommendations for the BEST examples of these types of games. The only promising one that I could find after a quick search was one called amagami. I don't really mind if it's cliche since I've never played something like this before. I just want a title that is a good example of what the dating sim genre can achieve.


These types of games seem to be mighty popular amongst otaku and i'm just curious to see what the fuss is about. Thanks in advance.

I just finished Umineko no Naku Koro ni, and it was an epic. Note that I didn't say it was epic - which it was - but that it is a tale in the epic genre of the same sense that the Iliad, Romance of the three kingdom, or Ramayana is in the epic genre. It is a tale of love, of human value, of cunning deception, and of the protagonist struggle against a cruel god; heck, it even technically begins in medias res, contains a praepositio and features a journey to the land of the dead. The only major difference, aside from the obvious medium change, is that a) Umineko is also in the Murder Mystery genre, and b) the protagonist on this journey is you.

What do I mean by that? Well, let's consider an analogy. A great visual novel, or any story for that matter, takes you for a ride; a trip in a convertible speeding down the pacific coast high-way. Having a good protagonist is like having Michael Schumacher himself drive for you - every curve, every straight, every climb and fall is orgasmic. Taking a ride down the Umineko highway, however, is slightly different: here Schumacher gets in the passenger seat, prepares a highway map in case you get lost, and then says ""you may begin driving at your leisure.""

There's a serial murder on the island of Rokkenjima, purportedly to revive the Golden witch Beatrice. Then everything turns absurdly meta and it's up to YOU to figure out for yourself what the hell actually went down. Yes, this VN is a fight between you, the reader, and Ryukishi07 the author. The protagonist exist as a vessel for your thoughts, and together you'll face waves of uncanny scenario, analyzing the situation and possibly learning a few logical deduction technique along the way.

Umineko was originally conceived as a sound novel, so it's not surprising that the music is excellent. The art style is 'different', but by no means subtract from the experience. However, there is a patch which redoes the graphics and adds voice acting - and I promise you these are some of the best voice acting in the industry. The cast of characters are extremely lovable, but takes a backseat because this ride isn't really about them; it's about you!

You can get Umineko patched in English by checking out [Witch-hunt's](http://witch-hunt.com/) website. You can get the ps3 graphics tweak/voice acting from [Umineko tweak](http://uminekofix.wikia.com/wiki/Tweaking_Umineko_Wiki). I highly recommend you check it out even IF you've seen the anime. You will not be disappointed.

For a long time, I've wondered whose mug that is that's pasted over /r/visualnovels reddit alien. I now know it is the Endless witch, the Golden Beatrice. I assure you she's earned the honor. After you're done with Umineko,  I'm sure you'll agree.

I started with Extra and it was at best, mediocre. I only read Meiya and Sumika's routes and ctrl skipped the other heroine's. 

For Unlimited, I only read Meiya's route and needless to say, it had good transition. 

And as for Alternative? This one takes the cake. No wonder many people love this series. Though, I can't help but feel some scenes were too strong for me to handle, mainly the [](/s ""TENTACLE RAPE SCENE""). I seriously hate those sorts of scenarios (lol). Now I'll have nightmares. [](/s ""Marimo's death"") was also pretty freaking gruesome. 

The story was somewhat predictable at times, like which characters will die. Though I never expected the ending to be as is. I thought it'd be only [](/s ""Takeru dying a heroic death canon ending instead of everyone else dying"") which also adds to why the game is great. Deviation from the norm, g/j. 

What a great way to spend my last Summer before going into university.

It seems like everyday people ask for recommendations here, and while we do point to some images (such as /v/'s list) I think its about time that we make our own for the sidebar.


As a simple way of voting, I request that you just list 5 titles that you think should be on the list. I will go through and pick the 20-30 most ""voted"" titles. I do plan on taking every vote seriously, so do try and stay away from the joke recommendations.


To get the ball rolling, my votes are in for:


Steins;Gate

Little Busters!

Ever17


Hoshizora no Memoria


Wanko to Kurasou



Edit: this might be the fastest mass response I have seen on this board. Some of you are not voting for five things, and I want you to know that you can, and probably should. The more people we can have input on this the better, so tell your friends :3


on a related note, grouping together a series (Muv-Luv) is fine.

1) Prepare your SD card, go into your root folder create a folder named VNDS.

2) Within the VNDS folder create another folder named Novels

3) Visit http://digital-haze.net/vndswiki/index.php?title=Category:Complete to download the visual novels that you want and their sound package if you wish.

4) Unzip the novel, please note that you may have to go into the folder created while unzipping it, and unzip the new file.

5)Download the VNDS Interpreter off the android market place, there are two versions, lite and the other. With the lite, you can't save, but if you are going through short novels it makes no difference

6) Insert SD card back into the device, launch the app, select your novel and enjoy.

What did people like and dislike about it? In general did you enjoy it?

Favorite scenes or lines from the VN?

I'll start with my favorite line from Planetarian:

*""The thing that was broken... was not me... but... ""*

*Her eyes of optic resin reflected the world around her.*

I love how the writers completed Revvie's sentence without her having to say anything.

So without further ado:

**[""What do you think about the Planetarium...?""](http://i.imgur.com/8Le2d.jpg)**

Edit 1: Copied text from Uguublog's post below.

From [vndb](http://vndb.org/v34):

""""An uninhabited, sealed off city, abandoned 30 years ago after a sudden biochemical warhead strike. The deserted ruins are ruled by autonomous battle drones. And there, you meet a young woman whose name is Reverie. A member of the planetarium’s help staff who continued to wait for customers for thirty years.""
Now don't get me wrong - I love Key. I think Clannad is better than bread. I fought all three of those stupid shadow creatures in Little Busters. When Rewrite gets translated, I'll probably vanish for a week or three.
Notice anything common about those VNs? They're all disgustingly long - over forty hours long. And, at least for the first two, their stories are bound around a single point, a single idea. That's what I've always liked about Key VN's. Aside from all the silly dating sim business, there's always an underlying idea that drives everything else. They're not just stories about chasing after high-school girls - they aspire to be more than that ( - although, they're sure as hell about high-school girls, don't get me wrong).

So, with all this in mind - I didn't really care for Planetarian. Yeah, shocking. I didn't care for it because the VN revolves around that old moe schtick that we've all seen a million times over: here's a weak, emotionally naive girl, and she needs your protection. Even though Key compulsively indulges in the moe stereotype, their characters usually given the chance to rise above their helplessness to develop and grow. Nagisa [goes from being utterly fragile to being very self-sufficient](/s ""goes from being utterly fragile to being very self-sufficient""), as does Rin (and the main protagonist of Kanon too, if I recall).

It's not like Planetarian doesn't give Reverie a backstory - but she has such a one-dimensional inorganic constancy that I never really buy into her as someone I want to care about. She's a very transparent character. Very likeable. Very predictable and uninteresting. The result? The last few moments ends up seeming melodramatic for no good reason at all.

But, hey, that's just my opinion.

Mind you - there's a plethora of things that Planetarian does right. The world itself is quite convincing, and there's an interesting dichotomy between the rough protagonist and the pure Reverie. In a way, the robot seems more human than the protagonist - there's something poetic in that. From the main character, we get the most character development and internal struggle - although I think it comes too late in the story for it to make any difference.

Other fun questions: did that whole repeating monologue thing with Reverie work? What are your thoughts about the art style? Is the insani translation group cool, or supercool? Did you call Battle-Mech A01 before the second date, or did you stand her up? And does Ayu Ayu-chan need more taiyaki uguu~?""",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,1339427060.0,,,True,t3_uuvud,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/uuvud/planetarian_vn_book_club_discussion_thread/,

If you're a Key fan like me... then you probably can't speak or read Japanese. You probably don't buy most of your VNs because of how expensive they can be, and how difficult they are to locate/ship. Key has created some of the best VNs out there, if not MOST of the best VNs. Clannad, Little Busters, Kanon, Air, and now Rewrite as well!

Maybe you've been wondering if there was another way to send some support from your far away country all the way back to Key? Well, one way you can do this is by making a quick submission to the ""Key 15th Anniversary Letter Project"". It can be made anonymously, and it doesn't take much time at all.

Here's the info about the project:
http://key15th.com

And here's the link to submit your message/letter:

I know some of you wont want to bother with this, and that's fine. However, if Key VNs &amp; Anime have effected your life the way they have mine, than I strongly urge you to write them a simple letter of thanks from where ever you may be.

That is all, and if you got all the way through this post, then thanks for your time!

Interested in a 3000 word teaser?",Keric,23,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/y24zi/we_need_testers_for_our_indie_visual_novel_themed/,"Test location (on Lightborne Lore's website): http://bit.ly/tstVNsbr

We’re curious what people think of our writing style and music direction, so we built a simple visual novel prototype using a 3,000-word chunk of the script draft. The art, music, and voice acting are not final, but the same artists will be creating the final versions. The gameplay is also pre-beta, but it's functional.

We've built a feedback form into the app with a few questions and a field for comments, so please leave any feedback there.

*If you're downloading the PC executable (no install required), it may be ""unrecognized"" by your virus protection. I promise it's nothing shady, just an unrecognized program by an unknown developer (us).*

*For anyone interested in our development/prototyping process*: We'll be posting the results of our test (insight gained, changes made because of feedback) here once we process everything.

Thanks a ton, Reddit!

EDIT 1: A lot of downloads and 4 survey responses so far. Thanks so much for the interest in our game! I know it's a lot to ask, but the more people who respond to the survey at the end of the demo the better. We'll be doing more of these tests throughout development, and feedback is crucial.

EDIT 2: We received a total of 21 survey responses, and even more downloads! This subreddit is full of beautiful people. Thanks to everyone that checked out this first teaser. **As promised, here is everything we learned from this experience...**

We primarily set out to test our writing style and the overall premise of the game. Our engine was too rough to be a good baseline for feedback, as was the voice acting.

* Based on the title of the post, the response to the overall concept of the game was incredible. Even though it's just a few words, it is valuable to see such a strong response to the paranormal and college elements of the game.
* People like the writing, even though it's an unpolished draft! 15 survey responders gave the writing a 4/5. 4 responders gave it a 3/5, and 2 gave it a 2/5. We have a lot of room to improve, but it lets us know that we're on the right track.
* This community is awesome.

A few more good bits of feedback, based on text comments left in the survey...

* Testers generally liked the music, and commented that it fits the text well.
* The main character's voice acting is passable at best. If we can't at least hit that quality with every character (and hopefully do better), we may be better off without voice acting. *Note: no final voice actors have been chosen yet*

Thanks again, everyone, for checking out our teaser and leaving feedback. It's really inspiring to see such an active response! **We will be putting out another teaser this evening. I will be making a new post with more info!**

Why it's there in the medium, what it does, why it should be there if it's just an artifact of the eroge roots of any game... I feel like perhaps there are some games that have taken sex and actually made something of it, but to be honest, I think I've only seen one instance in a visual novel where I thought they perfectly talked about two people having sex, and it made the game better for doing so... And that was in Ever17, which isn't even an H-game. [](/s ""I've had questions when I mention this before and I'm talking about when Takeshi and Tsugumi having sex in the Qualle, which was handled so delicately with Tsugumi being so extremely vulnerable for just a moment... It added some serious depth to her character. The notion that she was pretty caring had been out in the open for a bit with the whole mother aspect, but it confirmed it well."")

So, looking at Katawa Shoujo especially has made me wonder why the game should include sex if it doesn't want to come off as offensive. (I believe the dev team has come out and said that they set out to make a porn game and did, but lord knows the effect that the game has had on [people](http://www.reddit.com/r/katawashoujo/) is pretty [immense.](http://i.imgur.com/Kgade.jpg)) If it isn't looking to fetishize what makes it unique, why include it? I can't think of a person who actually came out of KS remembering it for the porn experience, and we're talking about a game that people talk about rather candidly if r/KS is any indication. So even though it may have technically failed as porn, why would that need the draw in the first place? Why not let the merits of the emotional appeal draw people instead and just cut the ero content?

Really, I don't think an h-scene itself is what makes the VN 'genre' so far ahead in the story department than a lot of other modern games; rather, I think the open nature of subject matter has kept the genre to be such a nice breeding ground for wild concepts that it can be such a good place to let creativity fly. If sex isn't taboo, what could be censored? Saya No Uta certainly didn't pull any punches talking about Fumanori's twisted mind. CROSS+CHANNEL didn't try to lighten up any of the more negative effects of their environment and scenario. Likewise, Katawa Shoujo never plays down the notion that you have to learn to accept your own faults as much as those of others.

I think the aspects of the relationships become so much more believable and personal when the game isn't limited by the boundaries of what other people let the creators use. A good VN lets the world that it tries to portray come out in full swing without trying to cut any corners, and since there isn't a topic that can't be touched on upon in a genre with such heavy sexual content, I don't think there's much worry that anyone is overstepping their bounds.

And I love that. I fucking love it. VNs have created some of the most coherently amazing worlds from writing, music and visuals, and the fact that people can develop them in any damn direction they want makes me love the genre so much. I don't know if True Remembrance's mute colors and contrasting warm and cold make it so uniquely warm and fuzzy despite the lingering sharpness of suicide, and fate/Stay Night's grim take on just about everything and love of characters with absurd amounts of power would be possible if they had any fear to make them be any lighter or have any limits on how they can portray the negative aspects of the elements that make them up.

I would say, though, that I still can't quite think of a time where I was impressed by an h-scene. Hisao's monologue made KS's at least insightful to read and relevant, so that alone made me fine with most of them ([](/s ""lemons, naturally, being the PRIME EXAMPLE"")). But something like KiraKira, which were VERY much shoehorned in sometimes ([](/s ""take Sarina having sex in the middle of being sick, which was just silly"")), most of Nasu's H-scenes in Tsukihime and fate/Stay Night ([](/s ""Akiha's was definitely not the right way to make a brother/sister thing seem right""))... I can't help but skip over sometimes. An H-scene seriously there for more than just rewarding the player with porn needs to be about more than sex to be anything more than an H-scene. (If, of course, that's something that's even possible when we're talking about a product that needs to sell. Naturally every H-scene would be integrated as well as it needed if developers were completely given free reign in a eroge, but I think the business aspect of the H-content itself holds the games back just a bit...Still, it isn't as bad as trying to dial it back for a safer audience.)",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,False,,,True,t3_pkm7t,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/pkm7t/after_thinking_about_it_im_glad_that_some_visual/,

I suppose I'm a little new to the scene but I'm excited to see everyone's stories nonetheless.  
My first visual novel was **Kanon**. I'll be honest, I was kind of depressed and lonely. I don't know how the conversation lead there, but a friend mentioned dating sims and how Kanon was a popular one back in the day. I figured I'd try it, thinking it  would just be something to kill time with.  
Visual novels more or less took me out of depression. I was so engaged in the story, getting to know all the characters and trying to figure everything out. For the first time in a loooong time, I was genuinely interested in something.  
**For anyone who hasn't played Makoto's route in Kanon, there may be some spoilers up ahead.**  
I accidentally got on her route, given I had no concept of how to make these choices. I was actually trying for Ayu or Nayuki, haha. I had no concept of the heroine archetypes, but I felt like I really didn't like Makoto. She was just annoying - up until the point where you choose to follow her. The good guy in me couldn't leave her alone like that, and when she started to actually be nice to me I started to really like her.  
When she started losing her humanity though,  it hit me hard. Seeing her struggle to eat and read, becoming useless and not knowing why.. it was so upsetting for me, and I had no idea this would happen. I cried like a bitch. And when they had their photo taken, my god....  
In my struggles in life, I never really cried, however it felt damn good crying for something like this. I even felt happy that I cried. It reminded me that I could actually be into something. This novel brought colour back to my black and white life.  
I'll always remember my first visual novel. This eventually lead me to try such novels as Clannad, Little Busters!, Kamidori Alchemy Meisters, Rewrite, Hoshizora No Memoria, Tomoyo After, the Muv-Luv Trilogy, and most recently Steins;Gate.

1368687425.0,19,self.visualnovels,1efs6o,"Hi, /visualnovels. This is a bit complex. Could you help me in a unique scenario? I have to give examples of VNs in a professional context.",Immaneuel_Kanter,20,1,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1efs6o/hi_visualnovels_this_is_a_bit_complex_could_you/,"I've been commissioned to write a science fiction VN for my university.

I met with the lead programmer today, who is a gentleman and a scholar, and, while the meeting was great, and he was relieved I was familiar with the genre, the examples of previous attempts he gave me were spartan: black text on a white background with blue hyperlinks for dialogue choices, in javascript. Not that I could do better--far from it--and he admitted it was less than what he was fully capable of, but it still took the wind out of my sails a bit. He mentioned his introduction to the concept of VNs were through games his daughter played on her DS. (I forget which ones.) He was excited over the possibility of mini-games as a gameplay feature.

I'm sure many of you are similar to me. It's all about the feels--the emotional connections we create with the characters' arcs. I haven't played many VNs, but the ones I've found and clung to as influences are heavy on story and character. (In my case, *Katawa* and, probably, anything Dischan will ever create. Making my way through *Stein's* right now as well.) I felt there would be a clash of visions if I didn't address my background.

So, I showed him RenPy and, being careful to avoid *Cradle Song*, directed him toward *Juniper's Knot*.

He was *very* enthusiastic about the potential of RenPy, had no idea about the larger world of VNs, was enamored by the screenshots of *JK*, and promised me he would play through it by the time we have our next meeting this coming Friday, along with the assistant programmer. At the end of the meeting, he asked if I could provide more examples like *Juniper's Knot*. In the moment, at a loss, I suggested *Dysfunctional Systems: Episode 1*, and told him I'd get back to him on it.

Earlier, I mentioned having him avoid the great *Cradle Song* demo hosted on Dischan's site. That demo is amazing. I still fire it up every once in a while just to replay that moment everything goes sideways and you're in a Windows 95 screensaver and oh no everything is terrible people are dying oh dang. Thing is, even that demo is a bit on the risque side for this particular context. This gentleman's exposure to VNs is through games his daughter plays on her DS. I doubt she's playing *Katawa Shoujo* on her dual screen.

This is a bit politically tricky.

So many VNs are complex in this way. It's the reason I can't recommend *Shoujo* or *Cradle Song* to friends, and certainly not to superiors, because I know what they are/will become, even if I personally use and prefer their optional SFW experience.

**The Point:** I need a list of the best games, games with engrossing stories and thorough characters, without a *hint* of NSFW. Something that would painlessly introduce a married, conservative seeming, father and professional to the potential of VNs as a medium. *Juniper's Knot* and the recent *Dysfunctional Systems* are good examples of what I need, but they were all I could think of.

Even though I appreciate the suggestions on the side bar, especially the ""No Erotic Content"" tag, this is socially complex enough that I feel I need some expertise, especially considering how gray the definition of the word erotic is to different people, and how little I know of the genre compared to most of you.

I need to show him examples of VNs that will blow any idea that mini games are a better idea than fluid story telling.",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,1368688966.0,,,True,t3_1efs6o,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1efs6o/hi_visualnovels_this_is_a_bit_complex_could_you/,

1356829118.0,19,self.visualnovels,15neqk,I finished the heroine routes of Rewrite today. Here is my spoiler free review. ,mamoranai,23,4,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/15neqk/i_finished_the_heroine_routes_of_rewrite_today/,"Since the common route is longer than any of the heroine routes, I thought that it deserved its own review. Your enjoyment of the common route is going to be determined by how much you like the characters and how amusing you find the humor. Fortunately, I related to Kotarou and found his crazy antics and insane stream of consciousness in the common route to be hilarious. Kotarou’s interactions with the heroines were all entertaining, but the scenes between him and Yoshino are some of the most memorable. Rewrite’s common route is a great example of how slice of life should be written. If Muv Luv Extra had been written this well, I don’t believe there would be as many people complaining that the trilogy began slowly. The only part I can fault the common route for is that the beginning is somewhat dry. You’ll have to wade through several weeks of Kotarou’s life before the characters all come together.


The common route is also filled with a great deal of foreshadowing and supernatural occurrences. The foreshadowing is sometimes subtle and other times obvious. There are many times that an experienced reader can pick up on the hints the writers of Rewrite are leaving, but there were other times that I was dumbfounded or taken aback by plot revelations. I can think of certain instances where I guessed what might happen correctly but was still surprised by the twist. The supernatural occurrences might start to feel convoluted, and the reader might start to wonder how everything is connected. Personally, I was satisfied with the answers given, and all plot points did stem for the same place. These rare delves into the supernatural might frustrate some impatient readers who wish that the story would move to the bigger picture it keeps teasing at. However, my advice would be to enjoy the common route for what it is because the heroine routes are filled with all you want and more. 


The common route does take on a much more serious tone towards the end, but it still does not compare to the heroine routes. Four out of five of the routes branch at the same point. The common route ends earlier on one heroine’s route. On that note, I was impressed by the amount of new scenes added for each heroine if Kotarou is heading towards her route. Only one heroine added almost nothing new to the common route, but it was forgivable since she had, in my opinion, one of the best routes. All the additional scenes provide even more foreshadowing and set up the reader for what is to come. 


I should comment on the interactivity of Rewrite as well. During the Mappie segments, you can explore the town and various other places. These segments are filled with nonsensical jokes that will leave the reader laughing hysterically or shaking his or her head. The Mappie segments are quite difficult to complete, and there’s a plethora of quests that can be completed and friends that can be made. Overall, I enjoyed the small amount of interactivity. Rewrite also has a number of decisions to be made, but the outcome of all is quite obvious. A bad end can be reached in the common route, but I have hard time thinking that many people will reach it unintentionally. 


Overall: 8.5/10

Kotori 

The creators of Rewrite should have enforced that Kotori’s route be played first. Kotori’s route is full of terminology and mythos that you will be seeing in the rest of the heroine routes, and it does a wonderful job of introducing it all. To top it off, Kotori’s route is full of many emotional climaxes that are sure to choke you up. The main complaint I’ve seen from fans is that Kotori’s route has no sense of closure. I have to disagree with this. I found the ending to be quite cathartic, and it remains one of my favorite endings. I’ve seen the story told in this route described as “barren”, but I found the emptiness it instilled to be captivating. I can’t say much about this route without spoiling anything, so I’ll leave it at that.

Overall: 9/10 

Chihaya

Chihaya’s route is filled with shounen tropes. While I don’t find that to be bad in and of itself, I feel that the story was too short for its own good. Some of the ideas presented were not given the proper amount of time to have the desired impact. Chihaya’s route also had the weakest writing of the five. Since the route is chock full of battles, this is even more noticeable. If the production had been better, this could have been avoided, but there weren't enough CG events to fill in the gaps of the vague descriptions. 


The route does have its good points, however. There are many sweet scenes between Kotarou and Chihaya, but it was the relationship between Kotarou and Sakuya that carried the route. The humor of the common route is present, which is missing from most routes. There were a few scenes in particular that I did find moving. Despite its faults, I never found Chihaya’s route boring. In my opinion, if something entertains you, it can at least be considered good. Therefore, Chihaya’s route was enjoyable, but it didn't grow into anything spectacular. 

Overall: 7/10

Lucia

I must point out that this was the route written by Ryukishi07. Allow me to use this time to talk about what an incredible writer the man is. If Umineko had been trimmed of its fat, it would be my favorite visual novel. Thankfully, Lucia’s route doesn’t suffer from the long-windedness that plagued Umineko at times. In short, Lucia’s route is everything that you should love about Ryukishi07. The man has a brilliant way of spending time on a subject that seems irrelevant at first and then making you feel like a fool for not realizing its significance sooner. If you have read Umineko, you’re aware of how talented Ryukishi07 is at writing moving romance. To my surprise, Lucia’s route was the most romantic. The deep investment you will have in Kotarou’s and Lucia’s relationship is enough to make this route great, but it also contains a well-crafted plot that only the twisted mind of Ryukishi07 could conjure up. 

The story of Lucia’s route stands alone from the rest of Rewrite. It has significance and intriguing world building, but I would have been more impressed if it had tied itself together with the other routes. I should also note that this was the first route that had an ending leaving me in complete shock. After finishing the rest of the visual novel, this was only the tip of the iceberg. From an objective viewpoint, this is one of the two best routes, but something in me wants to rate it little lower than Kotori’s and Akane’s. At the same time, I don’t want to understate how incredible it is. 

Overall: 8.5

Shizuru

Some people find an amazing ending to change their impressions of a story. Once you know what a story is working towards, it’s much easier to enjoy the entire ride. Most of the time, I disagree. I believe a story needs to be interesting a greater percent of the time to be called good. Well, this is one of the few times that the ending has altered my initial thoughts. I still can’t bring myself to call Shizuru’s route amazing, but this could be due to my personal preferences. I do like Shizru, but she’s my least favorite heroine in Rewrite, and Kotarou is the least heroic in this route. The beginning and latter half impressed me, but the middle was missing any exciting sequences. 

Shizuru’s route has a lot of crossover with Chihaya’s. They both add more impact to each other, but I wouldn't recommend reading Shizuru’s before Chihaya’s. It will spoil some plot twists. 

Overall: 7.5/10

Akane 

This is the absolute pinnacle of Rewrite’s storytelling. From beginning to end, Akane’s route immerses the reader. This story is the most grand in scale. Like Kotori’s route, it’s hard to write about without revealing too much. Suffice to say, the writing is mind-blowing. Like Chihaya’s, Akane’s route could have benefited from better production, but it’s hard to fault even that. Akane’s (arguably Kotarou’s) story is moved well enough with words. This lends credit to how strong a writer Tanaka Romeo is. After finishing all the heroine routes, I’m tempted to read everything translated by the author because what he wrote in Rewrite impressed me to such a great extent.

At the very least we can find something interesting to listen to! So here's mine. In no particular order, grouped by VN. Note: Possible minor spoilers or slightly NSFW content in youtube videos.

**Fate/Stay Night**  
Most people tend to know of [Emiya (UBW music)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uvhmN5EJNI) and/or its [various](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSm6nnwesV4) [remixes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZF29ATE3PTE). However, my favourite piece is probably [Trapped Thoughts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1djIkk7zpHE) and the [remix by ZTS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mShtsRXiNxM). Some good original music pieces also came out of the anime.

**G-Senjou no Maou**  
The VN remixes classical music to use as most of its soundtrack. The piece I like the second most is [Nigeba Nashi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm-EUknpIxw). I listened to the [original piece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7GftdLYSsI) - this one is 100% faster or so. [Sayounara](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V77PC5XzdY) is my favourite piece, but only because it evokes reminiscense of [SPOILER] so I'm not sure if it's as interesting for others who haven't read it.

**Umineko**  
Pretty much every long piece by ZTS is good, as well as a few others like discolor, although [worldenddominator](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR6PYrjEzcQ) and [goldenslaughterer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAupQUUglkU) are the ones I like the most. Also, [corruption](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQ97g2SMY7c) is a piece that sounds a bit like a ZTS but actually isn't (apparently by -45?).

**Hoshizora no memoria**  
The [ending song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4j-3YthFlGk) is great (also comes in instrumental and [music box](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcQB3l20724) versions), but a lot of the background music is quite interesting to listen to. [Mayoi Hoshi](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftxxFpfvGxc) and [Onaji Hoshi ni Umarete](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pWexzNMcv8) are nice.

Finally, **Majikoi** had a nice [ending song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CX02QFxJ8ww), sung by KOTOKO.

I'll churn through these books but I can honestly say I've never really felt any real connection to them, at least nowhere near to the visual novels I've come across here on this subreddit. Perhaps the extra dimensions of music and visuals are a factor in this, but I'd say visual novels just generally have better story-telling than the average classic, or at least story-telling which evokes a more emotional connection to the characters than any book. 

And then there are certain visual novels (Kara no Shoujo and Saya no Uta come to mind) that can flawlessly give that disturbing vibe of a horror story, while reading some of the most renowned horror authors (Stephen King, Bret Easton Ellis) just can't replicate that chill.

So r/visualnovels, are there books that you have read that you could consider on par with the visual novel style of story-telling?

I cannot, even with all this flattery, begin to describe my awe. Unlike Angel Beats! and Madoka Magica, I had heard nothing of the story beforehand, save the bits the anime has covered so far. No one ever alluded to what an experience it would be. 

Although now the VN I've been working at for a couple of months is gone. I need some new ideas. What other VN can I use to occupy my time? I doubt there can be another quite like Little Busters!, but I need some more quality titles. 

I tend to like romance, but really as long as it is a quality game, I'll play pretty much anything. I've already gotten Clannad and Muv-Luv, to name two. 

I expect Reddit to deliver. I'll go finish off Kurugaya's True Route, then I'll be back.

In this guide I'm gonna go step-by-step to help you hook, extract and then translate VN's text, for your full enyjoyment. I've written this guide 8 months ago and i wanted to update some things.
Things needed:  
*[AtlasV14](http://www.fujitsu.com/global/services/software/translation/atlas/downloads/trial.html) - The main translation program. ([PATCH](http://www.mediafire.com/?lysntwex7p5d1zp) - extract to ATLAS main directory)  
*[Mecab](http://sourceforge.net/projects/mecab/files/mecab-win32/0.98/)  
Things recommended:   
(Or [Download whole package](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?rpa2qbd646smv2a) &lt;- TA,TAH,ITH,Jparser,replacement scripts,devOSD,noregionloader in one file).  
*[ITH](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/208860-Interactive-Text-Hooker-new-text-extraction-tool) - Our main hook program.  
*[Translation Aggregator](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/94395-Translation-Aggregator-v0.4.8) - Our translation output program (contains AGTH but we'll use it with ITH)  
*[TA Helper](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/94395-Translation-Aggregator-v0.4.8?p=1811363#post1811363) - Clipboard revise program. ([Replacement script](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/94395-Translation-Aggregator-v0.4.8?p=2269439#post2269439) - Better translations)  
*[Jparser](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/edict_doc.html) &lt;- download and extract edict2 into ""dictionaries"" folder of TA.  
Optional:  
*[Apploc](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=8c4e8e0d-45d1-4d9b-b7c0-8430c1ac89ab) - small program that changes program locale, may come in handy.  
*[SpolierAl](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?d4zy26p6j4z2a9p) &lt;- Cheat Engine for VN games, lots of SSG inside (sry it's in japanese:P)  
*[NoRegionLoader](http://www.mediafire.com/?f0xx89sow1b5x5i) - some games are Japan only and you won't be able to run them, this little program bypasses that check.  
*[AGTH code database](http://agthdb.bakastyle.com/) - Hook code database (more on it later on).  
*[devOSD](http://www.hongfire.com/forum/showthread.php/139063-devOSD-transparent-eroge-translation-overlay) &lt;-Transparent overlay for games.
Now to proper guide:  
Installation:  
1. Install ATLASv14. Apply provided patch.  
~~2. Extract TA, TA Helper, ITH to the same directory.~~  
~~3. Extract replacement script for TA helper to the same directory (overwrite if needed).~~  
3. Extract my complete package.  
4. Install Apploc (optional)  
5. Change your unicode enviroment to Japanese (optional).  
Usage guide:  
1. Run TA, TA Helper and ITH.  
2. Make sure your TAhelper screen looks like [this](http://imgur.com/DYtRx) (turn your attention to the circled things).  
3. Now run the game you want (if you can't run the game then run it through Apploc, or change your unicode enviroment to japanese).  
4. Go to ITH  
5. Choose process tab. Then choose the game exe on the left and click attach.  
6. ITH will inform you on hooking up to the game.  
7. Go to the game and when text appears; ITH will find that text address.  
8. You must then choose the proper text hook (the one that matches your screen content) by clicking on that bar above the console (at start is says: 0000:0000.......:ConsoleOutput &lt;-click this).  
9. Now when going through the game ITH will send the text to TAhelper and then the output will appear on TA screen.  
10 (optional). You can use devOSD to make a transparent overlay on your game.  

Using custom hook codes with ITH:  
1. When you choose the game in process tab and attach to it use ""add profile"" button.  
2. The game should appear in ""profiles"" tab.  
3. Add custom hook to the user hook space. Click SAVE.  
4. Restart the game. ITH should autohook to it. Choose UserHook on ITH main window and translated text should appear on the TA window.  

That's it. Feel free to ask any questions. I'll add more images later, and also provide more advanced options like linking threads.

	I’d like to introduce all of you to The Human Re-Ignition Project.

-------------------------------------

Thanks to technology, people now live more convenient lives than ever before, and humanity has striven to use it to do away with the more bothersome aspects of life: shopping, sending letters, talking to friends, and work. All of these can now be done from anywhere in the world. There is no longer any need to go anywhere, meet anyone, or do anything sociable, and somewhere along the line these activities faded away. Gradually, and without much protest, the human spirit decayed.
This in turn made socializing the sort of thing that only happens on television and in movies. The minority left wanting to return to life as it was before stubbornly blame various leaps in technology, and while it may have been the catalyst, the truth is much more simple: society has atrophied, slowly and steadily. No one saw it happening, and if they did, they likely didn't care.
And thus is the setting for our story. Herein lies a tale about friendship, love, and how a group of random students living in an antisocial society will band together under an eccentric, and possibly insane Professor's leadership to bring color back into the dead world. It's a story about how technology quelled the flames of the human heart – and how the hard work and passion of a few will re-ignite it. 

-------------------------------------

If you’re interested in the project, please drop us a line at our [subreddit](http://reddit.com/r/alienworks) or our [blog](http://alienworksproductions.blogspot.com). We look forward to keeping you guys updated as time goes on! The final product will be 100% free, and is planned to be released on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

I mostly find reading e-mails and letters in games boring because they are about random people you never meet and rarely care about. So if most of the game consists of that, I can't say I'm to excited to contineou playing.

**So my question is: Should I soldier through it? Does the game/story pick up and become more interesting as it goes along. Is it worth getting past the boring introduction?**

2.  G-Senjou No Maou (first one)  Probably my favorite game, but looking for a more happy one =O  My favorite of them was probably Tsubuki just because I really liked her and her's was probably the happiest in my opinion, but it was still really sad at times.  Something like Tsubuki's with the sadness taken out would be freaking amazing =D

3.  Hanabira.  Hopefully something with a lot more plot than this, but it was still enjoyable

4.  Shuffle.  This was a great game.  Not as good as G-Senjou No Maou, but still fantastic.  It had it's sad parts too, but at least not to the same extent in my opinion.

5.  A drug that makes you dream - This is probably my second favorite behind G-Senjou No Maou.  Only gone through Aeka's though.  I would just feel too bad doing anything mean to her....

The second time it happened was with the opposite effect.
When I first finished Saya no Uta I thought it was good, but nothing overly special.

I didn't think about it much until I heard Shoes of Glass about 3 weeks ago. I started to remember the themes of it, and how fucked up the situation really was.

Got frustrated with the lack of options provided, and made me reconsider the necessary ingredients that make them good.

One of the best auto mode configuration I've ever seen implemented was, I believe, in Rewrite. You can configure:

 * The speed at which text appear
 * The delay before next page as a [multiplier] X [text length] + [Constant]
 * Whether to wait for voice-over to finish or cut/continue playing voice-over if proceeding
 * Had a preview window which reflects your configuration change in real time.

This basically accounts for all the factor my brain internally computes if I were to manually hit next-next-next over a ~40H VN; except now I don't need to mash a button. I can sit back AFK, eat, pour tea or whatever.

But if the auto mode configuration sucks, I almost prefer reading at my own pace than obeying the whim of some nebulous next.function().

How do you use auto mode? Do you even use auto mode? Do you like the text to appear really fast, then have a delay while you process, or do you like to read each word as they come up?

After reading through the majority of MLE and MLU, I thought people must be exaggerating when they said that MLA is one of the best VNs ever. And boy was I very wrong. MLA was simply a master piece.

It takes a very long time to read through all 3 series. However, thanks to this length, the Muv Luv universe was crafted with extremely fine details. There's admittedly a lot of infodump sessions during MLA. However, even though I did get tired from time to time, I was able to appreciate all the thoughts that went into every little things from geography to TSF's control to combat tactics. To not be outdone by background details, character developments were also very refined. I could understand and appreciate the convictions of even the low class soldiers. The main characters were all built off of the previous games, making their personalities that much deeper and more powerful. All the tragedies in the game really got to me; every deaths were meaningful and powerful because they were all reflected through the main character's attitude. I must say that telling the story through Takeru's first person view was a very effective way. His understandings, emotions, and perceptions of those around him really helped me become part of the story. Through Takeru, I could feel the desperation and the suffering ""humanity"" carries.

Everything was explained pretty well at the end and I'm glad for that. And of course, the secret ingredient for a great story is, most of the time, [](/s ""a bittersweet ending. It is pretty sad that Takeru does not remember anything, nor does anyone in MLA world remembers him."") Kasumi is the only thing that was left to interpretation but I think it was more like they wanted us to play Muv Luv Altered Fable. And damn right I will when the patch comes out.

This was an emotional roller coaster. If you're looking to immerse yourself not just in a game but in a universe, then give this a try. This game has helped me see the fragility of human life. I also learned a lot about kindness, helping others, and mourning is okay but continue to move forward in the face of tragedies. There's a lot more but now I'm just preaching. Ah well, go play the game!

TL;DR: If you've been postponing MLA because MLE was too slow, it's time to get to it. You'll get the full experience if you go through a few routes in MLE and MLU. But in case you want to jump straight into MLA, check out the summaries for MLE and MLU [here](http://amaterasu.tindabox.net/mlplot/)

1342438532.0,14,self.visualnovels,wn0t8,r/visualnovels reads a VN! - Take 2,uguublog,16,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/wn0t8/rvisualnovels_reads_a_vn_take_2/,"So our last attempt at a VN-book club was a bit thin - but no matter, let's give it another go!

Here's the criteria:


1. Linear VN's only. No branching plots, please.

2. Nothing too long - let's keep it in the 20-hour range.

3. Nothing too short either - Planetarian was nice and all, but its compact length doesn't entertain the sort of discussion that makes a book club fun.

4. Something that can be easily broken into smaller parts would be nice. Highly episodic VNs or something already broken up into smaller chapters would be preferable.


5. You may want to nominate something you're not in a great hurry to read. Collective reading tends to happen over a long period of time.


If you want to nominate a VN, post it as a main-level response. If it's already there, vote on it. Please keep general discussion out of the main thread and keep it under the nomination posts. The top vote wins.

If it's a VN that I've read, I can try organizing it into sensible parts to discuss. If anyone else wants to help out and set up the discussion threads and such, send me a PM. I'll count the votes next Friday.


For this run, I recommend that we read something unconventional, something that's difficult to understand. I think that'll give us a lot more to talk about. Anything by Liarsoft fits the bill: they're of moderate length and tend to be hideously difficult to make sense of. Lots of fun to read, though.

We wanted to do something simple for our first project, so it's a romance-based VN with just two pursuable characters.

It focuses on themes of death, love, the supernatural, and isn't as much of a ripoff of Angel Beats as it sounds.

I'll be frank - Forest is awesome, but it sometimes gets utterly incomprehensible. That's where half the fun is - there's logic nested deep in the madness of Forest's plot. I've read it and reread several times, and there are still interesting things to find.

It can bit tough to read, though - but power through! It's one of my favorite VNs, easily.


Before I explain how much we read, I'll explain the structure of the VN.

The following contains no spoilers about the plot, but if you'd rather figure out the structure of Forest on your own, then I'll hide my explanation.

[ ](/s ""There are two types of choices in Forest: the regular VN choices where you direct the plot, and 'signpost' choices, which simply play scenes. The regular VN choices work as they usually do. 'Signpost' choices appear in between major plot arcs, and are labeled by date. Clicking on a 'signpost' (they look like leaves) plays a scene taking place on the listed date."")


[ ](/s ""Beware, though - after you view the signpost's scene, any signposts taking place prior to that signpost become unselectable."")


[ ](/s ""Signposts appear in between major plot arcs. This is the general structure of Forest: plot arc, series of signposts, plot arc, etc. Start major plot arcs by clicking on crimson colored leaves."")


**If you'd like to read as much content as possible, read all the signposts in chronological order, starting from the earliest.**


We're going to read through the first two plot arcs: 'Prologue', and 'An Invitation Carried on the Wind'. Once you click on your second crimson leaf, read the scene it triggers and then stop. There are no choices in these first two sections, and they're both fairly short.


We'll convene two weeks from now, on August 5th. I'll post a summary of the plot material, as well as a few questions we might want to discuss. If anyone wants to lend a hand, please send me a PM.

I remember that I loved the music and atmosphere of this game so much that I sometimes even forgot to fap to it and just played it for the story.
Unfortunately everything I remember about the game sounds so generic, I had no luck with Google. Maybe any of this rings a bell?

It was a fairly polished game, with an ok English translation, good music, and next to no bugs. 
If I remember correctly, the story started out with me being in a car accident, and being saved by a mysterious lady who first had her way with me, of course, then brought me to a kind of... hotel for troubled ladies with supernatural problems?

Anyway, I had to go around seducing all of the troubled ladies who were suffering from being sexually repressed in the most creative and symbolic ways. First I had to find out about their particular brand of sexual repression, then seduce them to heal them. When I met them they were always either shy or abrasive, and after fucking they were happy and relaxed and departed from the hotel.

The first one was just an uppity bitch living in the hotel room next door, I think. One was tomboyish, always climbing on trees. Another was locked in a barn and haunted by a monster or something. Another was a ghost with silver hair who only appeared at night. There was a submissive maid. Towards the end there was a little red riding hood story. There must also have been some kind of underlying mystery about the mysterious saviour lady that got resolved in the end.

The sex was pretty straightforward, although there were some reluctant or ravishment scenes. There was only one scene towards the end that scarred teenage me deeply, where a woman in a french maid costume was tied up and given enemas until her belly swelled up.

I figure a lot of people here may have started with Yumiko's or Makina's route based on the guides and information that was around, but I wanted to talk about Amane's route.

What did you guys think about it? Were any feels had at the ending?

I personally thought it was alright. My friend was hyping it to infinity, as it's his 2nd VN played and he says he cried for 15 minutes towards the end of this route, but I personally some issues with the route.

Main issue: The backstory and its purpose. I don't see the point of a 6 hour backstory to illustrate regret and blame belonging Amane. I thought the backstory was pretty good for the most part, and interesting at the end, but predictable for the most part. After all, we were told Amane was the only survivor.

In terms of the development, the backstory really fleshed out MC's sister, Kazami who was incredibly and logically about to think her way out of any situation. I guess this will serve some purpose in the future novels, but I kind of wanted to see something more interesting with Amane. The necksucking part was admittedly pretty lewd and awesome.

The romance between Yuuji and Amane was fun and upbeat. The other heroines from the main route and the sillyness of it all made it pretty enjoyable to read. Yuuji decided to, of course, disregard Amane's painfully long backstory in regards to potentially being responsible for Kazami's death, and continued to love her despite that. 

I kind of didn't like the whole situation with Sakashita's father hunting for revenge, although my friend re-explained to me that it was due to him looking for a scapegoat after all his time, and he conveniently found where he could find Amane when he talked to the girls around the time of the festival early on the route.

The ending seemed a bit bittersweet. I would've enjoyed something without too far ahead of a timeskip, and with less cancer. The pubic hair bear was supposed to be that sweet kind of ""gift of grandpa"" part after Yuuji left, but the mention of the hair kind of killed the moment from me. It was fine that Amane continued to live and remember Yuuji's words despite her blame from the incident. The story had its own sort of closure, although I would've liked it to have ended off earlier, rather than skipping ahead all this time to try to give us some sort of heartrending moment with a newly contrived granddaughter. Overall, I think I just found Amane's blame from the backstory to be so ridiculous because of how we clearly knew it wasn't her fault. I didn't really  get emotional from her regret, and her past suffering didn't seem to negatively affect her throughout her route and the common route, aside from of course Sakashita's fated appearance.

I think my expectations were that of a nakige, and that probably warped my perspective of the route going into it, but despite that, I had some fundamental issues with how the story developed. It was a fine story, ~8-8.5/10 I'd say, although the slow story development and narrow scope of the events kind of disappointed me. The common route seemed to have some relative variety, but only a few drawn-out events seemed to happen in Amane's route. The writing, however, was excellent throughout. The writer of the Common Route and Amane's route is pretty competent at writing believable environmental details and witty characters (Yuuji and Kazami).

So what did you think about this route?

I personally like those with a lot of feeling, and here's the one's I've played:

Katawa Shoujo was the one I kind of got suckered into by a few friends. I didn't know about the genre, but whether it was just from being my first VN, or just how well it was written, it really hit me hard, and probably will always be my favorite.

After that, I tried out Yume Miru Kusuri, but Mizuki's path kinda got boring with [](/s ""the extreme amount of h-scenes that got tiring after a while."") I enjoyed the very intense ending for Aeka, and Nekoko's path was alright in my book.

Kira Kira was next, and I really enjoyed it. I'm pretty sure I'll play the sequel, but overall it was really great. Kirari's normal end left me in tears, and I was really satisfied with the overall story and all of the paths. 

Right now I'm about halfway through CLANNAD, but I haven't super-enjoyed it. Even though there are some pretty tense moments, I don't know if I'm just becoming less sensitive to them, as this has been a pretty positively-reviewed game. However, I'm not getting hit too hard in the feels, and the story has been alright, but with so many paths, it doesn't feel like something as central to the rest. I'm going to still finish it properly, though. I feel like I just need to play more for things to pick up.

[MINOR+EARLY SPOILERS],styr,17,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/15igtz/so_i_just_started_playing_muvluv_alternative_and/,"It was quite early on, during the part where Takeru goes back to his original world to speak to Yuuko-sensei about her theory. He was outside the school and saw his other self and Sumika, so he tosses the shoe at himself to avoid being seen. He talks with Yuuko and finds out the date: November 26th. Later on, while walking the streets of his city, he comes across Sumika and they talk; mostly about him being from another world.

That wasn't what blew my mind. What did blow my mind was when I fired up Muv-Luv Extra to see if this happened in the original, since I had forgotten by then; having played Sumika's route first, almost a month ago.

And I'll be damned, on November 26th, two things happened. The first is that, when searching for Sumika's shoes, her shoe rolled towards him for 'no apparent reason' and Takeru was none the wiser.

The second, and most important, was when Takeru, Sumika, and Meiya were having dinner that night. At some point, Sumika says something along the lines of ""I'll tell everyone about the *weird things you said today*"" to which Takeru dares her to respond, since from his point of view (and Extra players) he has no idea WTF she means. Sumika says that he was ""*talking about going to another world*""... and although Takeru blew it off, my jaw dropped.

Little things like that.... I expect I'll see more crazy things like that being foreshadowed from Extra if I look carefully. It wasn't anything special, but it really hit me then how well the Muv-Luv trilogy was put together, where a tiny event in Extra that was originally glossed over at the time is due to events from the future... ***that*** is what blew my mind!

What I am wondering is what things do you just hate in the Visual Novels that otherwise go in your top 5. Or even of the VNs you've played in general and enjoyed. Please put all the text in Spoilers and just the name of the game on the side so people can pick which games they want to look at.

Muv-Luv-Trilogy - [ ](/s ""So, overall I really enjoyed the Muv Luv series, and put it in my top 3. However I have to say that it got let down a little at the very end for me. This may be a a little nitpick that I have. But I really dislike it when the protagonist doesn't remember what he has done at the end. Usually it isnt as bad because you can still see the effort and rewards or some change in the game world. But in muv luv its like he didn't do anything, he only affected an alternate world."")

Chaos;Head - [ ](/s ""Chaos head wasn't the best game ive played, but its story was certainly enjoyable. The problem for me was their delusion system. It just didn't feel like you were doing anything. It was like hmm, situation, do you want green or red. And even if you chose the good one, bad shit could still happen. I just ended up not choosing any for the entire game. "")

Steins;Gate - [ ](/s ""So this game is amazing, but that doesnt mean I have nothing to say about it. It annoyed me that he forgets the time machine was on the roof in the other world. I can almost see it, since so much shit had been going on. But the other thing is the ending, it was good. But if you are going that far to say that they remember each other then please just a little further and give me some closure. This is just a personal opinion but I like more concrete endings.  "")

Sharin no Kuni - [ ](/s ""My biggest complaint here would be how unless you go with the sister, that nothing is done about the government. I understand it, but it just annoys me how they just say oh well, that time sucked. See ya sis. Also This may be wrong but is natsumes route automatically a harem route? That depresses me to hell and back. "")

G Senjou no Mauo - [ ](/s ""Has to be the ending. I am ok with bittersweet endings. But the police department are fucking retards. If he would of just told most of the truth then I feel like he would of gotten off with alot less punishment. Also to me, it pretty much felt like Maou won, he got everything he wanted and no one stopped him."")

In fact, all of her stories were ranked pretty high, especially her latest one.

The premise of it was that some guy gains the power to stop time, who then uses his new-found power in all sorts of ways to pleasure himself. Each chapter of hers is a full day of the main character's life.

I was very pleased about the fact that the story was not purely about having as much sex as possible. There's actually a fair deal of non-sexual scenes; not only that, the guy does not remain the same — he develops as a character.

As the story progresses, the main character starts using his power in ways that I didn't think he would, yet in ways that I enjoyed them nonetheless.

Sadly, the story seems to be abandoned, as day 6 of the story was posted around 3 years ago. Her inbox appears to be full as well and she has not given her readers any news on whether she would ever continue it.

This gave me an idea. Would it be okay to create a new visual novel based on her story, and actually end it? With multiple endings of course, based on how twisted the main character becomes due to the player's choices.

I realize that without getting her approval, adapting it would be plagiarism. Even so, I'd like to see it happen. Why? Because it's the best time-stopping erotic story I have ever read; including doujins and even a number of JAVs. Of course I had *some* problems with it, such as most of the girls during the ""party"" being *way* too eager to get laid, but those parts didn't stop me from enjoying the story.

It was amazing, the true end completely blew my mind, and now I need more

What would you guys consider the ""Must play"" VNs? Kind of like how Death Note is to anime

I've watched Clannad, STEINS;GATE and Higurashi; I don't feel like it'd be worth playing them seeing as I already know the plot, although if you feel otherwise tell me why

I'm kind of interested in CHAOS;HEAD, I watched the anime and thought it was shit, but some people say the VN is much better, and the guy who made it completely regained my trust with STEINS;GATE

I'm also interested in When The Seagulls Cry; same reason as CHAOS;HEAD. Heard the anime was crap (Havn't actually watched) but the VN is actually good.

I've seen that Cripple VN around a lot recently, but I have doubts about a VN that completely focuses on romance. I feel it would need some sort of plot to go behind it like Ever17 had.

I found it quite tough going, I finished Tsugumi's route first. Man the feels. Then I played through Sora's route. But I think I hit a ""chicken sandwich wall"", I found it a bit drawn out and I was finding the characters a little two dimensional [ ](/s ""unintended spoiler!""), I came back to it a couple of months later and played though Sara's route and half of You's before hitting the chicken sandwich barrier again.

I knew, from what people had been saying, that the whole reason for playing was to find out what actually happened on the true route, so this weekend I made a concentrated effort to finish off You's route and enjoy Coco's. I have to be honest I wasn't convinced at first. I thought it would be more of the same.

How wrong I was. I can't recall the last time I read a VN that made everything from the previous routes click so neatly, and the last few scenes I played with a big grin, and a nice little Epilogue afterwards also.

&gt;Hi Jean,

&gt;Thank you for your interest in our game. Yes, the game is an official release, and not a translation by a fan.

&gt;This release has been rated Teen and above by ESRB, and has also been given a 12 rating by PEGI.

&gt;It contains love content, but explicit content has been removed. There are kissing scenes and kissing sounds, but there is no actual animation showing that.
Beach scenes will show girls in bikini wear, and bathroom scenes will show girls covered by water, or by towels in bathroom scenes.

&gt;The translation might be a little stiff as we have restricted the dialogues to be similar to the Japanese version, and not allow it to stray from the original meaning.

&gt;Thank you for your support, and I hope that you will find our game interesting.

I know, im lazy and making you do all the job but meh, i just want to waste time.

Time to list stuff!

_____________________________________________________

So thats it. Thats all the VN that i put in my bookmark list. Which one should i play? Which one should i add to this list or remove?

Also, now is the time for me to do some sort of short review about the VN that i already completed even though I just did that in the list itself.
___________________________________________________

Clannad and Little Busters!: Those were just great. I mean, Key is just awesome. Those 2 are on the top of my list when it comes to VN greatness. Key is really great a creating characters and relations between those characters and when you are happy with everything, they kick you in the balls as hard as possible. God damn Key, never stop please. Also, the anime version of Clannad is surprisingly great. Not the same thing can be said about Little Busters! anime.

Ever 17: Man, that fun. This game just starts simple but then just keep giving you mysteries again and again and then just exploded in your face.

G-senjou no Maou and Sharin no Kuni, Himawari no Shoujo: What the hell is going on in those VNs? I mean, I hate what they do. They create a story and you go through that story by viewing in for the perspective of the protagonist BUT they put a big fcking mystery that is misleading on purpose and the answer is already known by the protagonist. Whats the point then? It just pisses me off but for some reason, i completed both. I mean, i figured some of the stuff on my own but the story lies or mislead you on purpose to create a greater sense of tension or something and i think that shows that the writing is not so good. But then again, thats just my opinion, some people like that kind of stuff. Even me, i admit i completed both and i had fun doing so but it happened too many times that i was angry because something that was known by the protagonist was left aside to surprise the reader. Whats the point of viewing everything from the perspective of the protagonist then? I just dont get it.

Hoshizora no Memoria: I loved it except for the end. The characters were interesting but the true end was bad in my opinion. I just didnt like the girl. I wanted the guy to meet her again but when it happened, she started acting like a bitch. At least, thats what i think. Still a fun VN.

Katawa Shoujo: Simple yet great. Of all the routes, only one was bad because it was made too simple. And its probably the only VN that i actually think the h-scenes are good, necessary even. Because they show the relation between the characters unlike most VNs which I feel like they include h-scenes because its fan service or something. Again, perfect for first timers.

Kira☆Kira: Simple. Nothing special. But still manages to make me feel bad. Nothing to say about this one except its fun.

Muv-Luv: Who still hasnt completed Muv-Luv? I mean, that shit was just great. I admit that the beginning has nothing going for it. Even completing all the routes feels tedious. The second chapter has does not feel as forced but still doesnt have much going for it. Dont get me wrong, its still fun and the characters are interesting but you just dont know where the story is going. But then comes Mother Fucking Muv-Luv Alternative and just rapes you. In a good way. If you haven't played Muv-Luv yet, you better put it in your list of ""Must do"".

Rewrite: I dont know what to think about this one. It was fun but it feels like the focus of the game wasnt put in the right direction. It feels like the story only needed 4 heroines but to balance that out they added Lucia which is kind of ironic because she was my favorite. Why I think they added her for balance is because all the other heroines's route are focus on other things than the relation between the protagonist and the said heroine. But not her route! And thats why i prefer her route. I mean, all the other routes are just [](/s ""foreshadowing for the Terra route""). Its still a good VN and the story is great but i feel like the way that was used to tell it wasnt fit for purpose. Plus, the end [](/s ""just feel fcking wrong. I mean, the guy just saved the entire world and what does he gets? He forgets everything about himself. He is transformed into a goddamn tree. He becomes a slave/servant. Some people might say thats not so bad because its the 5 heroines who get him but none of them remember him so whats the point? 3 of them knew him when they were kids and none of them remember him. Thats bullshit. Kotori wanted to be with him all the time or something and now she doesnt remember him. He saved Akane like twice or something and she doesnt remember him. Ok its true that she had some sort of mental illness if i remember correctly but it still pisses me off. And Shizuru only met him once but she is Shizuru and i though that her weird personality would actually allow her to remember him. But nope. So it doesnt feel like there is any accomplishment."") At least thats what i think. Also, Yoshino is my favorite character. Doesnt that tell a lot about the story? Isnt someone's favorite character suppose to be one of the heroine or maybe even the protagonist? Maybe that just me over-thinking things but thats how things are. Im so full of shit. Key is great but that wasnt one of there best in my opinion. Its still worth playing. I mean, this whole text is just about things that i dont like about it but there is also shit tone of good things that i didnt mention. Go play it.

Tomoyo After: That was awful. If you expect the ""After Story"" of Clannad but focused on Tomoyo instead of Nagisa well fuck you because thats not what you are gonna get. Im gonna spoil it all and wont hide it because its not worth it. Everything felt wrong to me when i play it. The beginning is just dumb. 5 weird h-scenes right of the bat. The new characters are annoying. Even Tomoyo felt annoying for me. The kid just pop out of nowhere and everybody is just like ""Yeah a new kid thats not mine so im gonna take care of her even though that means those responsible for her will just go away without a problem."" And she doesnt have anything going for her. She is just used for jokes, and bad ones at that. The brother has no personality. He is just there so we can laugh at Tomoyo and his problem is just boring. The random girl is so annoying. I dont know how she is suppose to be likable. It happens so often too that the story feels forced to make Tomoyo strong like she was in Clannad. I mean, in the original game, her strength and what not was used to make jokes and build her character but in this VN, it feels so forced. Also, what kind of end is that? At the end when the story finally gets to the point where Tomoya and Tomoyo have to get over a problem together (im talking about the [](/s ""memory lost"") thingy), it doesnt feel like it makes any sense. It just comes out of nowhere and it has nothing to do with any of the characters. Its just a problem the writers used because it could be used in any situation. Also, what kind of ending is that? I heard that in the true real end, Tomoya [](/s ""dies"") but in they changed it so he just [](/s ""lose the use of his body""). I dont understand how this is suppose to be a fulfilling end but meh, the whole VN felt wrong so its normal that the end does too.

Yume Miru Kusuri: Its just full of wtf and for that its worth playing. Not much else to say.

I got into VNs about 5-6 months ago (through Katawa Shoujo, of corse) and I've been slowly going through more and more. (I've built up a list of ones I'm going to read eventually.) Anyway, I'm in the middle of reading ""G-Senjou No Maou"" which I'm sure, if you're reading this, you're familiar with. I'm really liking the writing quality and ""production value"" of the VN.

There's been one thing that's bugging me though.

I can't connect with any of the characters, PARTICULARLY the main protagonist. (he's kind of an ass) and it's making hard for me to like it. I've read that (especially the 'true route') has brought people to tears and that it's amazing... but so far I'm not impressed.

So my question is this: From the perspective of someone who loves ""likable"" characters, does it get better? Is it worth continuing to read? and is the ending really THAT amazing?

I recently played a game that had a mission where I had to infiltrate a party and it got me thinking about how much I've enjoyed other games and books that have this kind of thing in.

I really like the idea of politicking, hanging out and generally gathering information mixed with backstabbing and plotting.

The problem I have is that this seems to be a ""feature"" of a number of different games, books and tv series that I enjoy but I haven't found any game that has this as the main attraction.

By politicking I don't mean raising faction reputation and the like. What I'd really like is something more like [Long Live The Queen](http://www.hanakogames.com/llq.shtml) where I have to mingle with people, involve my character in political relationships, make friends and also make friends as a means to an end.

I guess my main question is, do the 3 routes (Fate, Unlimited Blade Works, and Heaven's Feel) have good endings along with their bad endings, or will I have to live with bad endings for some without any compromise?

This was my third visual novel, after Katawa Shoujo and Clannad. I truthfully enjoyed it. 

When I first started to play, I had this feeling that the humor was a bit too absurd and silly and I might end up not liking it at all, but after a while I understood how funny it actually could be (Remember Masato?), so I started to enjoy this game on a whole new level. 

So I finished my first route, and of course I immediately started a new one. [ ](/s ""Well needless to say, to those who played this game, know that Riki just attends his first semester over and over again, like he is stuck in a loophole. In the beginning I had a feeling it was something like this, because after you were done with one route and started a new one, the player sometimes carried his experienced from the previous route into the new one, like faint memories and sudden bursts of emotions. I didn't pay too much attention to this at the beginning. I never had a feeling this game would turn into something really serious."")

[ ](/s ""When I started with Rin's route (After finishing all other ones.), I just knew shit was about to get *real*. This game became so creepy (Man, that monotone music.) and so many new things just unraveled before me. Gradually I began to grasp the situation and things got a bit easier to actually understand. For a while although, because I noticed that Rin and Riki didn't know something that everybody knew. The game made a really good job at making the player feel hopeless and alone. Well, needles to say when you learn about the *secret of this world*, despair truly sets in. The ending was so heartbreaking, knowing that everybody died and Riki and Rin were the only ones that survived. Kyousuke and the rest did everything to make the two stronger so they could live happily after the accident. I seriously could not accept this. I couldn't control my gladness when I actually saw the real ending. After you finished the shitty one, the player gets to chose if he want to keep fighting on. Naturally I kept going on, saving everybody's asses. Well fuck that was insane. Seriously."")

The ending felt like ALL the good endings of all the routes, just made into one glorious ending. Little Busters really had it all. So, let me ask you something. For the people that played Clannad and LB, which one of the two visual novels did you like more? Oh and can somebody help me with this, it appears so that I only completed 55% of all the available CGs, after completing all the routes. I think this is quite strange, I'm not sure what I should do anymore. Also, I noticed that when I want to play the 3 new routes, everything is in gibberish, so if anybody could point me to a legit English patch that would be super nice.

Hey guys, Non here, with an annoucement to make. Cphere Studios is a very small group we organized with one goal: To create this visual novel. We all love visual novels, so making one was a dream come true. The plot of this visual novel in a ( very small ) nutshell is :
You are Sato Fuyuki, stereotypical highschooler. Through the story you meet 3 different heroines, each having their own unique personality. After you finish part one, depending on what choices you've made, you'll be led into part two. (Similar to Katawa Shoujo), part two will be locked onto whichever heroine you have ""chosen"" to be with in the first chapter. In part two, you'll be battling your own war, not knowing what's a dream and what's reality. At the same time, you'll learn about your partner's back story and personality, all while growing closer to her. Each story has a unique twist to it, so get ready for it~

I hope you will enjoy the project, I don't know when it'll be released, but I'll update you all in this subreddit with posts titled (Yume Update #).

Thank you all again, and if you could, help publicize the project with social media and whatnot, it'll help motivate us a lot on this project!",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,False,,,True,t3_1jm7q5,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1jm7q5/yume_ni_oikakeru_chasing_a_dream_visual_novel/,

But even though it've been great, there are few things I just don't get. I hope you guys can help me clear them out.

1.  In 7th game, we get quite a good explanation about story behind Beatrice, but in the end it's unclear who it was. That person clearly existed, and yet I just can't figure out who was it they were referring to in this game. Was it Shannon second personality? (Which I doubt but hey, it's a probability)

2. The date of the tragedy: 1986. It's mentioned that if Battler came back some year earlier, or year later the tragedy wouldn't be this big. Is it ever explained why this date exactly? I couldn't catch anything...

3. I guess that all these games are just Tohya's way to sort his memories of Battler out, but the single fact still stands -- just what happened on Rokkenjima and why? As we can gather from Ange's reaction it was something really... easy? Can't find a better word for it. I have a theory or two, but I'd be interested in reading your thoughts.

4. I just remembered another quiestion I had. Just what is the solution to the 6th game closed room? 

That's it for now, I may add something tomorrow after I get some sleep, I just wanted to get my thoughts out while they were still fresh. I'm looking forward to your comments and I hope I haven't asked anything obvious.

Recently I had an idea. Why don't we as a community get together on a regular basis and discuss our favorite VNs. Talk about the ups, the downs, and the in between. In doing so, we could naturally create our own multi-perspective views on several titles, while simultaneously getting a better understanding of each other and what it is we like about VNs. What if we saved these discussions, so that now if I want to know a bit about Clannad I can simply go to this weeks discussion thread, find the link to the previous discussion on Clannad and read up on it?

I thought it was worth pursuing, so I asked the mods and they told me to go for it. So why not? If this is something you'd be interested in, post here, and say what you'd want!

In my mind, there would be a (tentative/flexible) schedule of upcoming discussions so it would give people time to read upcoming VNs if they wanted to. I'd want to mix in a variety of VNs, with a focus on some of the more primarily known/popular ones, but every now and then throwing in something a little more unknown out there. I'd want to keep spoiler rules mostly in tact, as hopefully this could eventually become a guide for newcomers to discover a little more about a VN they are interested in. And above all I'd just like to get a regular dialogue going in our community.

I know we kinda already discuss VNs all the time here. But often times it's announcement of news, or a thread about some technical question. Once a week, I'd like to just sit down, and talk about my favorite VNs, or learn some more about one's I haven't even read.

Fate/Stay Night, Fate/Hollow Ataraxia, Yume Miru Kusuri, Sengoku Rance, Majikoi (all but the untranslated parts),Tsukihime, Chaos Head, Katawa Shoujo,  G-Senjou no Maou (playing), and lots of hentai-centered titles.

1335087377.0,11,self.visualnovels,smgv6,Hoshizora no Memoria -Wish Upon a Shooting Star- What did you think about this game? ,Cactu4r,12,1,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/smgv6/hoshizora_no_memoria_wish_upon_a_shooting_star/,"I started playing a few days ago. It took almost 9 hours to finish the common path. I also thought it was going to be a kinetic novel the way it didn't have a choice until about an hour into the game. 

I've only played 2 routes so far. Asuho and Isuza. 

I am anxious to find out more about the common path. I learned ""her"" name is [ ](/s ""Yume"") through Asuho's path and learned nothing else in Isuza's. Hopefully the other paths will delve into more of ""her"" story. I was thinking that Mare's path may shed light but I'm not so sure she even has a path. I did notice choices opened up for Chinami after I finishes Isuza's path so it may be that I have to play more routes. 

Anyways, I'm just curious what everybody who has played thinks about the girls, the common route leading up to the [ ](/s ""showdown on the hill between You and Kosame""), and the game in general. 

As I've played only Asuho's and Isuza's routes, I'll say that I liked Asuho's a little more than Isuza. I enjoyed Isuza's outcome the most though. I guess it was just the way Isuza acted. It was endearing at first but got so annoying after 10 hours of ""Jump off a bridge"". I started losing passion for the play through. I did find myself generally wanting to help her and felt bad for her situation. I did tear up a few times. The payoff for Isuza was worth it I believe. 

Asuho's was generally more enjoyable than Isuza's. Her personality was easier to handle and the secret about Asuho and why she always positions herself the way she does was pretty neat. I loved the few lines from Kosame about their [ ](/s ""encounter on the hill and how You was even cool and composed during the event""). 

As for the other girls. 

Chiname: I should hate her. I want to hate her. Everything I've learned from anime and visual novels screams at me to hate her. I love this girl more than any of the others however. I think it has to do mostly with Isuza's path but even before I fell into that path, I wasn't annoyed like I should have been. 

Hisakaki sisters: I liked the [ ](/s ""confrontation"") with Kosame during the common path. I can't wait to play her path. Komomo doesn't really hit anything special with me but I am interested in more of the [ ](/s ""confrontation"") story to come out so I can't wait to play either of their paths. The whole yuri bit I could care less for and I'm hoping they don't play that out too much during the paths. 

Mare: like I've said earlier, I can't wait to play her path in hopes of finding out more about ""her"". Not the biggest fan of her attitude but it can be cute and adorable when she is obviously smitten by You. 

The black haired ""on paper"" girl: Other than what happened at the end, I could probably care less for her since their is not interaction. I am sure she will show up in Hisakaki or Mare's paths and am interested in seeing more of that story. I'm not sure if she has a route or not because at the end of the common path it surely gives her a reason to have a route with the way it shows her emotions wavering to her job. 

Suzuha: I hope she doesn't have a route unless its a non-romantic option. I still love this girl to death though. 

Anyone who hasn't played it yet, it's pretty long for a game that has branching paths.

&gt;If you're working on a visual novel, feel free to announce it here, but wait until you have something to release before making an announcement. (Recruitment demos are fine, just don't post ""here's my idea"" without anything to show for it.)

This way, we can keep [/r/visualnovels](/r/visualnovels) to discussion of VNs, general development of them, and the medium in general, but give people a space to ask for help for their ideas or start up new projects.

Any VN project that has something to show for it besides snippets of script or concept art is welcome here. But for those projects that don't have anything that we can play with yet, we mods feel that this isn't the place for them.

A.) Treat it as a navigational book and use walkthroughs to reach the ending? You're just in for the ride and you're trying to enjoy the plot?

Or...

B.) Treat it as a game, where you put yourself into the protagonist's shoe and make decisions based on what you would personally make?

I'm clashed on how to play. I recently started Clannad, my first VN, and I'd love to play it like a game. But... I'm afraid I'll miss out on scenes, lines, etc., not to mention that doing things my own way without any sort of guidance would lead me to getting confused on what I did, didn't do, where it branched, etc. It would end up turning into a game of backtracking to the point that it'd get tedious and I'd quit. Or, at least that's my worst fear anyway.

But on the other hand, just reading it like a book and using walkthroughs like a tool without any imput/decision from me seems almost... boring.

My thoughts and request for help in finding something a little specific.",BlaineCraner,16,8,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1738yy/so_ive_finished_3_visual_novels_my_thoughts_and/,"My adventure with visual novels started on a bit snobbish side. The first time I've heard of them was from a creepy otaku with a pedo-mustache that I had the pleasure of sitting with in the tram for half an hour. He (and a fanbase from a local manga-club) gave me the impression of VNs as just another mediocre, weird, filled with tentacles shit that Japan decided to shat out one day into the international orbit. You can say I was bit of a hater of anime/manga/games from Japan at that time. Mostly because I couldn't find any good ones that weren't prehistoric ""classics"" or simply filled with ridiculous stereotypes,  annoying charaters, moronic plot and, in case of games, bad design elements. I was on the verge of prefering to inhale lage quantities of powdered glass than to touch anything from Japan ever again.

Well wasn't I surprised after finishing ""*999: Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors*"". What I thought was a medicore adventure game with anime-ish flavoring turned out to be one of the best piece of interactive fiction I've ever experienced. The characters were likable, the plot was solid, the mystery was cool and I loved the decision making that led to multiple endings. MOAR, I said.

So I started researching *999* with the goal of finding more stuff like it. That's when I learned that it wasn't just an adventure game per se but also a Visual Novel. ""This isn't right"" I said to myself ""where is the batshit crazy plot and annoying fucks that could drive a hardcore buddhist monk to suicide?"" 

My research ended there, but then my brother told me about this anime based of a Visual Novel. In other words: Steins;Gate happened. At first we made fun of it like hell ""Hur hur, Shutainzu Getoru, hur dur durp!"". Later we praised the TV on our knees for blessing us with the presence of such an awesome, well written and original story.

Thats when I said ""Thats it!"" and decided to try out another VN. I lurked around here and there, asked around and made fun of people treating anime and manga like the second coming of Christ or something like that. ""OK, let's see. Ever17. Seems everybody is talking about it and sounds emo enough to riff it to oblivion. Let's try this shit out!""

...

This is the part of the writing process when I stop typing for about fifteen minutes and remember the profound experience I had a couple of days ago called ""*Ever17*"". Never in my life had any medium invoke such a strong emotional response in me. I liked every single character, the story was genius, the mystery was engaging, the revelations were mind blowing and the ending was satisfying. I laughed, I cried (""Fuck tissues! I need a towl""), I felt guilty for choosing one path and not the other (after one of Takeshi's endings I just couldn't stop thinking ""It's all my fault"" for some reason... weird huh? ;] ). 

It was simply and literally **awesome**.

Feeling a hunger for more I've picked up Chaos;Head next. It was made by the same guys that made Steins;Gate so I just had to try it out... and I don't know what to think of it. It was kind of disappointing but also unique... in a sadistic way. Reading through it was painful at some times, but the delusion mechanic was interesting at times. Then again some delusions were too much and I found the protagonist unrelatable. The only thing I could feel about him was pity, because of the suffering he went through.

After all that I can say I'm no longer so bitter and hateful towards stuff that comes from Japan.

**Tl;Dr: A hater of stuff from Japan, like anime and manga, lost all his bitter attitude after discovering visual novels like 999, Ever17 and Chaos;Head.**

So, right now I'm looking for something specific. One of the aspects of visual novels I really like is the decision making. I just like the feeling that each choice has meaning, that each choice is important and can influence the ending. I would really like to play a visual novel with a lot of choices next. Can you guys recommend one?

First of all, if you're reading this, you're probably at least somewhat interested in creating a visual novel of your own.

Sure, you've read visual novels. Sure, you watch anime, and maybe even read manga. But you're looking to making your own content!

If enough interest is expressed, I'll start up a subreddit for coordinating details and the likes. But, this thread is primarily for establishing a few things early on.


People we need:

- Artists. People with experience drawing backgrounds or characters in the traditional anime style. Menu and window design is also desired.

- Programmers. Although the production is likely going to be via Ren'Py (the same engine used to program the well-known Katawa Shoujo), we'll need people who feel comfortable incorporating all of the various elements of a game into a whole symbiotic package.

- Musicians. Depending on the atmosphere the writers agree on, you will be trusted with deciding what music goes where. Oh, you'll also be responsible for writing that music. Oh, and performing it.

- Writers. Were you picked on in high school because you knew what auxiliary verbs were? Then we want you (and we promise not to pick on you)! Although everyone on the project will have some say as to the general storyline, once that has been decided on, you will ultimately be responsible for writing that story. 



This will not be a short process. I don't want the final product to be some turd tossed on the side of the road like so many visual novels before. We should take our time and really make something we can be proud of. So what say you reddit?

Besides the usual suspects of spelling and grammar errors, be on the lookout for plot holes, logical inconsistancies, incoherent dialog... that sort of thing.

If you've any suggestions or criticisms, please make them constructive.  If you've an idea that will make the awesomeness over 9000, we'd love to hear it.

While I enjoy any visual novel that has a good story, I prioritize on playing the ones that have erotic content first because it adds more depth, it's more realistic.

What is not realistic though is the overly vocalized and exaggerated sex acts that describe everything. I mean everything. It's not even funny how bad that is to read. I get it if developers ever did a couple of them to add variety but so far ALL OF THEM have been like that. It's the same with hentai stuff in general. No I don't want to hear the girl say ""your cock is so big"" every time they see it, no I don't want to know how their juices are mixing and how their hips are thrusting. No I don't want to hear the girls moan on the first touch on the tits as if their sexual sensitivity is somehow 500% higher. No I don't want  to read shit like ""let's cum together"" or ""your cock is inside me"" and the list goes on. I don't even want to think about them, I want to forget.

So far all of them have been like that so my question is, is there any VN that breaks the clichee or it's simply not possible for anything that's made by Japan to be different in that aspect ?
Hell even Katawa Shojou wasn't more different.

Also sorry if this is NSFW, I don't know how to make the thread as such.

EDIT: I must also mention that the VN should have a story and not be completely based on sex.

That is to say I have only very faint idea about how the route system works, so during my first playthrough (and still the only one), I chose options that felt right to me and not those that were recommended by some walkthroughs. It seems that my choices led me to the Rin's route. Then I looked at [this walkthrough](http://tlwiki.org/index.php?title=LB!:Walkthrough) and I reckoned that at the end I decided NOT to cheer her on, which led to some short scene, then Riki thought he wished this to stay forever and the game ended. Fortunately I had some a position saved close to that option, so then I tried to cheered her on, which lead to prolonged scene, where Riki and Rin guide the visitors through the school and after couple of days she is offered to change the schools for a few terms but she is thinking about declining the offer and then Riki passes out in the hallway, when there is an abrupt end. So are those two ends the only ones for the Rin's route? When I'm on my next playthrough, what choices should I make, to get the most of the ends without having to repeat the scenes I've already seen/read. Any other tips for the beginner like me? I've chosen the Little Busters VN, because I've seen Clannad + AS anime and it completly blew me away, how awesome it was, and knowing that LB is another VN by Key to get an anime adaptation, I decided to try the VN first. Any help with as little spoilers as possible will be appreciated. Thanks

Secondly, do you think it would be mildly ""profitable"" to create a service like this? I'm thinking: grab licenses from the original Japanese developers then work with current fansubbing groups (Baka-Tsuki, Doki, etc.), not by packaging the fan translations directly, but by pointing the customers to these groups. By profitable, I mean enough to pay for new licenses and server hosting at most. Basically just in the black enough to keep afloat. How difficult do you guys think this would be to set up?

[NSFW][Spoilers all over],Nightray,17,9,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/rj72j/fatestay_night_did_sakura_raped_shirou_in_heavens/,"//I'm not using spoiler tags because the whole post would be blacked out. You proceed on your own responsibility//

My best friend and I are huge fans of Fate/ franchise and we used to talk over the series for hours. Lately, I brought back a most controversial topic of our discussions in which I set a bald theory that in between the lines Sakura raped Shirou during the Heaven's Feel scenario. Even though I provided an indisputable evidence, my friend still refuses to accept it as a fact. Since I can't find anything about that matter on the internet (because whenever I type 'Sakura' and 'rape' in one phrase I end up with items about her being raped by Shinji) I thought I can introduce this topic here and see how you, my fellow Redditors, feel about this theory.

The scene that I am refers to happenes at the 5^th day, after Sakura collapses in the bathtub. At that point we don't know why did she collapsed, however later in the game it is revealed that she is infected with crest worms and needs to replenish prana through sex. From [Shirou's description](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#0) we clearly see that her condition is caused by crest worms.

After Shirou took Sakura to her room he went to Ryuudou temple and returned late at night, then he went to bed and had a wet dream about Rin. [As he later describes this dream came suddenly](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#1). The dream was weird in few places, first of all [he did realize that this is a dream](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#2). Secondly he couldn't wake up or rest even though he wanted to: [He starts to pass out](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#3) but [the dream doesn't ends](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#4) and when he is convinced that [this is finally over](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#5) against his will [the dream continues](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#6). 

**My first evidence** to prove that this is Sakura's doing, is the fact that on all of the screens Rin has closed eyes and [she opens them only when Shirou want's to stop](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#7) after that he is forced to move on. Did you noticed? Her eyes are definitely not normal. [She has Rider's eyes](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#8). Shirou did met Rider on the  4^th day, but she was blindfolded all the time which means that he never saw those eyes, thus he couldn't possibly be dreaming about them... unless the whole dream was caused by Rider and her Mystic Eyes.

**Second evidence** is in the very next scene where Shirou has a nightmer. He dreams about the fire from 10 years ago and [he sees something that wasn't suppose to be there](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#9). Again, he couldn't possibly be dreaming about the [graal](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#10), unless he transfered this image from Sakura.

**Third evidence** is the fact that at the morning Sakura seemed to be fine. She shouldn't be if she didn't replenish her prana. Shirou, on the other hand, is shocked when he wokes up. After such a dream [he was sure he would have to clean](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#11) but [he doesn't have to](http://imgur.com/a/5Jrwg#12). Impossible, unless Sakura used his semen to replenish her prana.

**And the last one**, Sakura is pretty much aware of what happened that night. When she thinks that Shirou is sleeping, she sneaks into his room. He opens his eyes surprised, so Sakura lies to him that she's there to take his temperature (He's not feeling well) and comes closer to him. When she gets too close he recalls the dream and stops her. When she asks why, we have a choice to lie or tell the truth. If we choose to tell her that Shirou had a dream she is excited and asks who was in that dream, and when Shirou confess to her that it was Rin, Sakura immediately leaves the room and is obviously pissed off.

Inspired by Katawa Shoujo, we want to create a Visual Novel diverging from the typical mold. It actually began as a web-manga, but due to an unfortunate event, we could not bring it into fruition. With the release of Katawa Shoujo and other amateur VN projects, we are determined to see this project through to the end.

So, with the effort to attract fellow creative people, I'm putting together a preview of our vision. Over the course of a month, I've learned the basics of Ren'Py, a Python-based game engine commonly used to create VNs, and wrote one of several prologue chapters into it. I am currently using placeholder images for the backgrounds until a design choice is finalized.

Sample: http://forums.lux-iris.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=10

**The premise:**
The story is set in an original but generic fantasy world. It follows the adventures of several characters with radically different backgrounds who are part of an adventuring agency. An agency is a company whose employees take on dangerous jobs. While each has their own personal agenda, they all have a stake in the world-changing events that are developing around them.

**Setting:** Hard Fantasy

**Genre:** Adventure, drama, mature.

**Presentation:** Third-person view, multiple POVs, linear story.

**Engine:** Ren'Py

**Release:** The current plan is to release it for free. 

...

 
**The Team:**

**Writer:** Magic (Myself)

**Editor:** Ren (Story), C-Kun (Proofreading), LandBassShark (Grammar)

**Artist:** Aisolus (Colorist)

**Music Composer**: Walko [Sample: http://forums.lux-iris.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=9]

Right now, we want to build a team. What will follow is brain storming/drafting to flesh out the setting and story. Once we have a good grasp of the scale, we'll need to figure out the amount of assets that we need, and who will do what. The first milestone will be completing the prologue chapters, which will also serve as the demo version. 
None of us have any experience with making VNs. We do not expect anyone who wants to join to have any. We can learn as we go. But what we do expect applicants to have a skill to bring to the table, and the dedication and time to make this a game worth playing.

**What we want:**

- Writers

- Artists (Background, CGs, sprites, colorists)

- Programmer (Python)

- Director

- PR/Marketer/Community Manager

I will be self-funding this project. I have a significant portion of my income that I can spare. So, we are willing to negotiate commissions with the artists, provided their skills are good enough to be paid for.

If you are interested in joining the project or simply following it, then check the development blog and forums for more information.

I've been a semi accomplished comic colorist for the last 4 years, and have assisted on projects for Marvel, Dc, Image, IDW, ect. I've also really taken a shining to writing and recently released my first 5 page pitch issue of my creator owned book Android Panda (www.androidpanda.com)

Anyhow, I have struggled for a while with my love of comics and games. Games have kept me alive for years, allowing me to escape reality when shit got real, so I have a deep love for the medium. Comics are creative powerhouses that have also served the same function to me and many other readers, though I come from games and would love to leave my mark there. 

I could never really grasp coding, or even felt a ton like messing with the non coding interfaces of game makers. I could find and artist and coder and work on an indie title, the ideas come cheap to me and that is one way to go, though I can't offer much if any pay, and would feel bad expecting a team to work on a promise or a hope to get paid later. 

Interactive fiction is something I've been watching for a while, mostly on the text based side of things, but stumbled upon visual novels and it all seemed to click. I can't claim to be an expert to the medium, or even experienced, I'm just getting started with being a fan of the visual novel. Though I've been a student of telling stories, and producing music, and some art for a good half of a decade now. 

Anyhow, I guess I'm just asking if people would like to see a more western take on the visual novel? I know there are some, but they seem to emulate the stories that have came before them. I love me some manga, anime and eastern traditions, though it's just not where I come from, and not my style. 

I think my first foray into it would be with my already developing comic Android Panda. Not a  serious, gripping tale, but more of a love letter to 80's cartoons. Though if it turned out to be an awesome experience I could see jumping quickly into Noir, Crime, Femme Fatal, and even some way more experimental ideas, like a Dear Esther or playing with a more psychological experience using audio, writing and color to provoke emotion. 

Just an idea at this point, always open to ways I can team up with few people and express my ideas and maybe earn or make some pizza money at the end of the day.

1374480971.0,9,self.visualnovels,1isuhd,[Spoilers] Finished Danganronpa was a cool experience,stitchwithaglitch,11,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1isuhd/spoilers_finished_danganronpa_was_a_cool/,"I started the visual novel after I saw the anime and just had to see what's was going to happen next, but with the detail that a visual novel would provide instead of just the anime (from what I watched the game made a good transition to the anime).

Anyways, seemed like a death battle mystery stuff in the beginning which are two genres that if done well = a very entertaining story. I enjoyed the fact that each murder past the 1st trial led to unexpected plot twists such as who actually did it. I honestly didn't get a single suspect right besides a certain one, but I didn't actually believe it because I didn't think a trial would actually happen if it was suicide. 

The real thing I care about though besides the mysteries was the story of about the world where this set of events was actually happening. The mystery of the academy itself was something interesting because the main reason these children were put into the school to murder each other by Monobear's claim was DESPAIR. After the first anime episode, I thought to myself this plot is going pretty far across the line to have a survival game like this for the sake of causing despair among it's students. I honestly didn't think I would be alright watching the show, but I knew there had to be a deeper meaning to the events besides causing despair. I'll get back to this later.

The cool thing about this novel for me was the fact that I could walk around the school and investigate it at the same time. Sure it isn't anything crazy revolutionary where I'm basically just moving my character and clicking on objects as the story is holding my hand throughout the novel guiding me, but it still felt really good in a sense that I had the freedom to be able to do this in a visual novel which I hadn't experienced in the previous ones I played. The school itself was also really cool as new parts of it were unlocked and even though I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life in it, I never got tired of going to the cafeteria every morning to meet up with the cast. The artwork of the scenes and the world looked great too. The characters were all detailed and the use of their sprits and 2D images in place of the world gave them a unique and satisfying feel. The other things that looked cool were the I'm guessing CG kinda cutscenes.

The next thing I want to remark on is the cast was pretty good. These are the type of characters that already have their defining feature and personality where they don't actually NEED to grow to be interesting. The game ignores that and still gives you the option to learn more about just them the basic, ""Hi, I'm the super duper something student."" Since we as the player get to make relationships with them  and in doing so learn more about their characters which is added to the profile. Aside from all the characters, my favorites being Byakuya, Naegi, Kirigiri, and Asahina. The real cool thing was the actual antagonist. Monokuma was done really well, even though hes basically evil in the form of a bear, I just couldn't hate him. He's does all his actions in such a silly lovable way that everytime he popped up onto my screen, I was just say hey mono-bro wazzup? And then I'd get scared when he would respond with a morbid action that gave no care to human deceny.

The next thing I wanted to remark on was the sense of danger and excitement I got from this novel. Visual Novels have made me feel a lot of different emotions when I read the, but this was the first one where I was just freaking out scared about what was going to happen. Coupled with athe great atmospheric soundtrack, the idea that there would be a good chance past this door I'd see a corpse was scary as heck. The executions that occurred were also scary, but exciting and even humorous as well. It's all so well done at setting a pace of things that it left me wanting so much more as the novel progressed. 

Next thing refers to the pace. The class trials that happen were basically interactive mini-games that allowed you to piece together all the clues you found in one exciting event. Everytime I found the lie in the non-stop debates I just went BOOM YOURE WRONG. Solving mysteries never felt as good as in a class trial. The games for the most part were pretty fun, although it was a little annoying to learn and get used to them as they grew more difficult. This didn't deter from it in anyway unless the instructions were too vague so I probably got stuck momentarily at some points, but its not a big deal because nothing major happened. The only other bad thing I can think of about the class trial is no matter what, even when Naegi wasn't the most targeted suspect in the debate, if you get a game over, each time Naegi is the one decided as the guilty party. It's kinda lazy on the makers side to not make a specific bad ending for each trial to keep consistency with the story.

Lastly, and and I'll and put a spoiler tag for this is the actual endings of ending. [](/s ""I wasn't able to figure out any of the murder cases besides Sakura's because the only possible way she could've died was suicide with the poison. I didn't actually believe it went that way because I didn't think a class trial would occur if she died through suicide but besides that the point it, each class trial murder led to me not figuring it out before hand and being completely unpredictable. What I did manage to piece together was the ending. First and foremost, I wanted to say since I first saw that Kirigiri was titled, ""Super Duper ???"" I knew she was a super duper detective. It was one of the obvious things about the novel. The rest was pieced together rather quickly. I just needed three major hints. Information about the 16th student, a realistic idea about the what the world was like outside the school walls, and more concrete proof of the two  time skip happening with the characters having their memories erased. Anyways, I the main point was I thought the ending was done really REALLY well. Besides the fact that the game trolls us by throwing a kangaroo court class trial, they finished off pretty strong in terms of the FINAL class trial. All the pieces were put together really well, and even though I didn't realize the mercenary girl and model chick were twin sisters, I still figured after I saw the clue that 2 of the students were traitors, it seemed obvious that things about the model girl were more suspicious than one would think due to the type of death she had."") 

[](/s ""In terms of the ending class trial and epilogue I thought they went really well except for some minor complaints. What was done well though was the class trial itself, the unveiling of the true antagonist which was super duper model girl and her many entertaining personalities, the world being what it was, and the use of hope to fight against it. The ending did bring in a lot of just unbelievable things to the table such as the great tragedy that ended the world which gave reason to why the Danganronpa events were happening and how why the students were stuck in this closed off school. They were really out there though, and only in a video game could it be made possible but still, they are really unbelievable in terms of circumstance. The information was still delivered well and felt shocking as despair seemed ever so likely to close in on me (This sense that an inevitable bad end looming over my head provided great tension). The way that Naegi ended up fighting back using hope in a non-stop debate was crazy awesome though and a GREAT idea by the game makers. Seeing everyone slowly gain the courage to look past despair and move on was something special. That shinning light to fight this terrible idea of despair that was being thrust down their throats by model girl was spectacular. Her execution was also something... indescribable. The only thing I didn't like was during the epilogue was when they're about to step out into the unknown world that was supposedly ended. WE DONT GET TO SEE THIS APOCALYPTIC WORLD. Instead we skip to the credits and I'm left sad and incomplete, would've liked a kiss or something with Kirigiri, that would've been awesome. I can only guess what it is without concrete proof from the story, and until I get my hands on more information concerning Danganronpa's sequel I can only be left in the dark until then. The other thing I wanted to mention that I didn't like was the fact that the world did somehow end with a super duper malefaction event. It's another one of those things where it just sounds too far out there to be a possible event even in fiction, but nvm that. Main point is THIS VISUAL NOVEL WAS AESOME."") 

[](/s The thing that will probably stick out to me the most from the ending was, it used ""Hope"" well. There are many times when plots will use hope, friendship, courage or some other random crappy happy feeling that allows them to vanquish the evil, but most of the time its done poorly or as if you didn't even need to go through the trouble of doing it. Danganronpa allowed me to use hope in such a gratifying way that I didn't need to think this was some cliche, because it wasn't. They used hope in a very instrumental fashion to give the story's end in the fight against despair, and very fulfilling ending."")

TL;DR Danganronpa was an awesome visual novel experience. It brings so much intense excitement to the incredibly dark story through the gameplay, plot, and characters that its a unique adventure you don't want to miss. The best thing to me is how ""Hope"" is used in completing the story and I am just really happy I got to experience it.""

Apparently some people got bored from the slow pacing, but I managed to pretty much marathon it for the past 3 days to finish it.

Anyway, heavy spoilers incoming, in case you didn't read at the top.
I had some questions that I missed, mainly regarding Tsugumi's behavior in 2034, and You(haru)'s incentives.

So, in You and Sara's routes, which take place in 2034, Tsugumi is supposedly lured to LeMU by You(haru). She's told that she would be re-united with her children and whatnot. Did You(haru) let Tsugumi in on the plan, which was to fool the KID in 2034 into believing it was 2017 in order to bring forth Blink Winkel? I mean, Tsugumi knew she had a child with Takeshi, and that this guy suspiciously had the same name, and she was being trapped in the same LeMU from 17 years ago, so I assume she had to be 'in' on the plan.

My next question is about You(haru)'s incentives. I found this paragraph googling for Blink Winkel.

(Its hard to say who is the real mastermind though. Blick Winkel told You'haru the plan only because he knew about the plans from watching You'haru and Kaburaki carry it out in the year 2034. However, You'haru and Kaburaki only carried out the plans because they were told to do so by Blick Winkel. But Blink Winkel told them the plan only because he knew about the plan from watching... See the Temporal Paradox here? No one will ever know who originally came up with the plan. Then again, if you studied real life Time Travel philosophers, you might argue that the plan did not originate from anywhere, and it never needed to.)

I'm kind of confused, because I don't think this is what happened.
Here's what I thought:

Takeshi drowns and dies in 2017-&gt; You(haru) somehow comes up with the plan to awaken Blink Winkel and excutes that plan -&gt; Blink Winkel watches over everything in 2034 -&gt; Blink Winkel goes back to 2017 to wake up Takeshi at the ocean floor, so he can get back inside LeMU with Coco -&gt; Blink Winkel tells... one of the You's (Or maybe it was Yukine, I forget who it was) that Takeshi and Coco are still down below. -&gt; Takeshi and Coco are unable to be saved directly in the year 2017, because of a time paradox, and Takeshi turns to disgusting goop and Coco disappears when BW checks the results in 2034 -&gt; BW goes back to 2017, tells Coco and Takeshi to stay in the pods (for 17 years) and then goes back to 2034. Now we're at Hokuto's (Takeshi's son) perspective, and he dives down and saves Coco and Takeshi after they've been asleep for 17 years.

So I guess the main questions are...

What inspired You(haru) to awaken Blink Winkel, if it wasn't Blink Winkel himself? Time paradox with no real start?

Why is Tsugumi going along with the plan from 2034?

I figure these are all the preserve the mystery in the visual novel anyway, but I'm still wondering anyway. I'm reading through the TVtropes page, it's so cool x.x

[Rewrite] Spoilers(?),EternalSmoke,9,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1b15i2/just_got_done_with_lucias_route_rewrite_spoilers/,"Hi guys, this a follow-up to [My previous thread.](http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1al5pw/just_got_done_with_chihaya_route_rewrite_spoilers/) Lucia's route is definitely the best I've played through so far. It did not move me to tears like Chihaya's (probably because of my mancrush on Sakuya) but it had the best writing so far and is the deepest(?) in terms of the heroines problems. That being said, I could not agree with some parts of the route and i'm hoping that we could discuss it, as in my previous thread.

Lucia was very, very unfortunate, i admit that i have not experienced anything even remotely close to what she went through but i can understand on some level having been bullied as a kid. She handled it pretty well, to my surprise... up until the end. Do you guys think she was being a bit too bratty in the last thirty minutes or so? She's unfortunate yes, but all her friends came for her, who is she to say she has nothing to live fir, she was brainwashed yes, but i did not see any signs of that at the end. Kotarou too must take some of the slack too for being so damn dense, but it was required for the story i guess.

Now this is my biggest issue with this route, i dismissed the last one because i could not possibly understand what it felt like to be her, but this one is real bad. She killed 200k people! Are we just going to ignore that? She also tried to kill Kotarou twice( It can be argued that she knew Kotarou would survive the poison) The second time he definitely would have died if Chihaya had not saved him.

I found [Hesitation Snow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIbCgbvfgRY) a while ago, for the VN [Hatsuyuki Sakura](http://vndb.org/v7302). It's the OP song. That led me to fripside, for which I only really like the last two albums because of the heavy use of vocal distortion in the earlier albums. 

More recently, Youtube showed me [ 絢爛 _ finality](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAmX2l4EoGA), track #28 from the [Mahoutsukai no Yoru](http://vndb.org/v777) soundtrack. It sounds like a combat piece, and it's pretty great. I haven't listened to the entire soundtrack yet but [Track #2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3EUoJ_X7fM) is nice (starts off slow, the beat picks up after 30 seconds).

Since Amaterasu is going to translate [Coμ](http://vndb.org/v1896) before Rewrite Harvest Festa (sigh, I want some extra closure. Second symptom of post-novel depression: obsession with music), I decided to check out its music. [It's got a nice OP, at least](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvMwK1M21Wk). And [here's OP #2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhfsjDnZ-q0) and an [insert](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LorhkaiS-U).

Finally, back when I finished reading Hoshimemo, I really liked Chata's ED so I went and listened to all of her other works. [Here's the ED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loFHPMy85o8) to [Suiheisen Made Nan Mile](http://vndb.org/v972).

**tl;dr:** Has anyone found interesting music from VNs that ~~you~~ I can't read?

First up. The thing that made me think of this, The summoners from Rewrite. I started to realise that in most Key VNs there is a creature of some sort that doesn't seem real. Chibimoth is a familiar that can alter people's mind to make them think he isn't a mammoth. The same goes for Botan and Potato. Potato doesn't look like a dog at all, but nobody except Yukito really seems to notice. Also, Yukito is a weak summoner who can only control a small practisc doll.


Secondly, In little Busters they create another world. Much like the City of Stone in Rewrite. The Little Busters created a small closed space where the flow of time is stopped.


Third, Mai from Kanon has a superpower, the power to heal with her tears. Also possible that she is a summoner and that's how she created the demons. It's also plausible that Ayu created a familiar of herself, Eating away at her lifespan which is why she never woke up until she disappeared.

On one hand the story was amazing of course, the characters, CG, music, etc... were all exceptional, but I never found myself terribly moved by anything that happened. I didn't cry at all although there were some very sad moments. To put this in perspective, I bawled all through planetarian, and even Saya no Uta made me tear up at the end. I'm thinking maybe I didn't play it fast enough (I spread it out over about 2 weeks) and didn't get emotionally invested in the characters, but perhaps I just didn't care for them at all. I played through all the routes in Extra/Unlimited before hand though and found them reasonably enjoyable.

I also found the ending a bit disappointing, unfortunately the massive amount of hype left me expecting a lot more out of it so I'm afraid my experience was severely diminished by this. This is largely my own fault of course, and now I feel like I've missed out on something great, but I can't decide whether that's true or if I simply didn't connect to the characters. It definitely didn't feel like I had played over 50 hours of the game, I can't tell if it's just because I'm a fast reader, or because of how exciting it was. Oh yeah, the story was incredible and I constantly wanted to see what'd happen next, but in the end I think it relied too much on the drama of everybodies deaths to make a memorable ending instead of using the overall story to bring it to a better close. I wasn't really fazed by any of the deaths as I saw them all coming from miles away (lucky guesses some of them), so the ending just really didn't do it for me.

This is just my opinion of course, everything about this VN was excellent, but I believe the massive hype as well as my indifference to the characters really took away from the experience in the end. I wish I could've enjoyed the ending more, because although I really enjoyed the VN overall, all I can think of now is how the ending could've been better.

---

I noticed that I really enjoy series with a mitxure of comedy, drama and supernatural themes and I especially love the moment where you realize that these characters are deeper than they seem. I think it was a good idea to use stereotypes as tsunderes and yanderes and write it in a way that shows the dark, less amusing sides of them. I began to really like the characters while fearing them as the same time. I am also a big sucker for character development, especially if the MC was kind of a douche the whole time before. This whole saviour/messiah thing gets me everytime, sacrifsing himself for his friends and so on.

While I personally prefer happy endings, it's still good to see a series which does not follow often walked path. Nevertheless, I wish that Taichi could escape his prison of isolation. At least he kinda looked happy at the end.

Now to balance things out: I would be more satisfied if they would explain two things a little more in detail - Nanaka and the whole phenomenon which is occuring. I am still wondering if Taichi could'nt just escape that place if he wanted to by just either wishing for it or oberserving himself through a mirror. Maybe he didn't want to?

(Spoilers Everywhere, read at your own risk)",ParadoxQc,9,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/17avju/little_busters_spoilers_everywhere_read_at_your/,"So... Today, I finished Little Busters! and I got to admit, it was one of the most amazing experience I ever had.

Just so you know, at the moment I am writing this, I have no idea of what I actually want to talk about or where I am going so if you read this, you are probably gonna see a lot of jumping from one subject to another. Its probably not gonna be that interesting either but go ahead and read it if it entertains you.

Now that's out of the way, lets begin. For starters, I am pretty new to Visual Novels. I started with Katawa Shoujo like many others and after finishing it, i actually thought that that game would be the one that would get the most emotion out of me. Then i found out the VNDB and was quite surprise to see it wasnt on the first page when put by popularity or rating. Somewhere on a forum about KS, i saw a post that said something like: ""People that play KS and praise it too much and stop it there wont be able to appreciate any other VN."" That made me think about what i was doing. I actually was praising the game a lot too and was interested on trying some other VN but i didnt know where to where from that point on. Also i was pretty depressed so i thought about trying some VN with a lot of H-Scene just to change my mind. Something less serious probably wouldnt hurt.
Thats when i found 3 other VN that i tried. 1 was about Human pet or something. I liked it but for all the wrong reasons. Lets say that i was laughing at the game instead of with it. It was pretty shitty. The second one was Yume Miru Kusuri (A drug that makes you dream) and i actually had fun with it. For some reason i didnt like it as much as i thought i would. Probably too much sex bullshit which is kind of ironic because that's what i was looking for in the first place. It isnt bad but not the best in my opinion. Then it was Monster Girl Quest's turn. Holy crap thats good. I cant wait for the last part. Sometimes you find the best things where you less expect it. Now that i talked about my whole experience with VNs for some stupid reason, its time for Little Busters!

Now the spoilers are gonna come from everywhere (probably... i dont know, i haven't writing it yet).

I dont remember why i tried this game in the first place but holy crap it was so worth all the time spent on this game. I am just remembering every little details that i didnt really cared about at first and i finally realize how much details there is. When I started reading, i thought it was going to be a simple concept like KS. Choose a girl, make the necessary choices and enjoy the little story between the characters. It was enjoyable. All the characters are fleshed out and are fun. All the mini-games are fun at while doing the prologue. Then i tried to do Rin's route. i was wondering why to game would stop it when it was getting interesting. I was following a walkthrough so i already knew that Rin had a second route unlock-able by doing the five others. I thought it was because she was Riki's childhood friend and her route would have more impact, that it was just a way for the devs to make the players enjoy the game as much as possible before the big end. Simple stuff. It was the same for when you complete a route and Riki become stronger the next playthrough. In my head it was just a way to give a little sense of progression to the player so the prologue wouldnt be always the same. But the parts about the text that change a little bit and the routes that get blocked when completed picked my curiosity. Dont get me wrong, i wasnt thinking the game had a whole plot hiding behind it and what not. Again, i thought it was just a choice by the devs the make the game less... repetitive i guess. I got to admit, now that i think about it, i wish every character routes would have been a little longer. I dont know why that it, i mean they are all great and complete (Execept maybe for Kurugaya's route which bugs me. I'm not sure i get the end. If someone could explain it and help me confirm my theory, that would be really appreciated). But then... I got to do Rin's second route which was already a big surprise for me. The ending of it felt really weird but that's what the devs were aiming for i suppose.

Now comes Refrain. I just dont know how to talk about it. It was just so... Great. There is so much suspense. How did they manage to do this? They kept talking about how Riki had to become stronger but i didnt know why or wtf was going on. I think thats the right expression for the situation ""wtf is going on"". The childhood friends then gets their own little routes and some events are explain. I cried so much during these parts. If only i knew where it was going.

The moment things begin to become clear... I dont know how to describe it. It was so powerful. I mean, the guy who decided to use the fact that you need to start the game over to start a new route and make a whole story based on that is a genius. Because of it, things like why Rin was acting weird at the beginning of Refrain gives so much suspense even though you actually know what happened. You just dont have that one little detail that you need to make the connection. I still cant believe it. The ending has so much weight. And i thought i cried a lot while i was doing the normal routes... What a fool i was.

If you are still reading this post, you probably noticed that the only thing i did was just tell what happens in the game. But i guess its the best way to describe my feelings for it. I spent so much time liking and reading about the characters, i spent so much time enjoying the atmosphere the game has yet i dont think I cant express it all clearly. But one thing is for sure: the Little Busters! is a masterpiece! Or at least its in my list of favorite games ever.

Now, i am currently watching the anime based on the VN. Its a shame, really. Not the anime itself, i think its quite interesting. They try hard to make it feel like the VN itself, they use the music and the ideas like the battles thingy from the game which is really nice. I wonder if Key as a lot of power over the anime or if the name of the company is just put in the credits because they own it. I just think that its a bad idea to make a anime out of the VN to start with. Why? Because they cant get the same feeling or atmosphere or whatever. Its too rushed, things happen too fast and the characters arent as interesting because they are not developed enough. I guess its a different situation for those who actually finished the game. I wonder if there is many people that watch the anime who didnt play the VN. Its cool that they try to include every little event in it too but it doesnt feel right sometimes. Maybe its because some characters dont have the same voice and its really bugging me. Anyway, i actually enjoy watching it even though they cant give the viewers the feeling of restarting a new game and making the beginning different each time because there is only one beginning. Im really curious how the end is gonna be show. Are they rushing everything now so they can focus on the poignant ending? I hope so. If not, where are they gonna stop? With Riki and Rin in the hospital? I hope not.

Anyway, im done rambling about. I made this post mostly because i dont have anyone to talk about it so i dont really care if no one reads it. It would actually make sense if nobody reads it because its not really coherent.

Lets just say that I am now a fan of Key even though i havent play any of their others VN (yet)

[SPOILERS],needsmorerage,10,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/15jqwj/finished_gsenjou_have_a_question_spoilers/,"Hey r/visualnovels, First off, this first paragraph or so is about G-Senjou, and if you don't want to read that you can **skip to my question at the bottom**.

So it's been a week, and some of you hard-core guys who're on here all the time might remember my ""Should I finish G-Senjou?"" post from a week ago. Well I finished it.

There were great things about it, and some not-so-great things... but all in all I really enjoyed it. I was pleasantly surprised when I reached the end and realized it was loosely based on *Crime And Punishment*. (One of my favorite books.) I thought this was a really cool adaption... but the irony is that the things I disliked have not changed with the knowledge that it's based on that book. I feel like there was an over-all Silliness to certain parts that actually became really annoying. (If you've ever read Crime and Punishment, you know that it's NOT a silly story.) IMO this novel would have benefited from being more serious and sticking to the overlying dark theme. Also, the poorly set up sex scenes were definitely disappointing. I'm not one of those guys who can't appreciate a good sex scene in a story, but I AM one of those guys who hates ""unnecessary"" sex scenes that are just there for the ""fan service"". This didn't quite go that far, but it did get to the ""uncomfortably stupid"" kind of feeling. To cite Crime And Punishment again: There's no (obvious) sex in the book, however if there was it wouldn't have happened at least until what is the ""epilogue"" in the VN. Another thing that bugged me was that I couldn't fall in love with the characters like I always want to in a good VN. The protag. was too much of an asshole, even compared to the book... and the girls were a bit too ""typical VN heroin""-ish. (You know, the goof ball, the tsundre, and the shy one? We've all seen it before.)

Anyway, **TL;DR**: The VN was based on a dark book with a deep message, and it ventured just a little too far away from that core. Still a great read though. 8.5/10

**Here's the real reason I posted this**:

I always really want to fall in love with the characters in a VN... (since in this medium it creates character-reader bonds that can't be had in books or movies.) and my biggest let down was that it didn't get a really strong emotional reaction out of me. I'm one of those psychos who like a story to tear out my heart and bring me to tears. haha

What's a good VN to read next if I'm looking for LOADS of feels/tears? (Keep in mind, I'm not just asking for VNs with sad endings, although that is okay... just something that will make me REALLY emotional.)",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,False,,,True,t3_15jqwj,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/15jqwj/finished_gsenjou_have_a_question_spoilers/,

For more indepth info on the project, or too follow development, [visit this link.](http://prt-chips.deviantart.com/)

But the reason im posting here (other than to take a break from copying and coding) is to look for a few people to alpha test the early build, and to look for an artist (even if its only a temp. Right now the only thing holding me back from coding full time i the lack of art, or artist to fill the needs of the project). Normally i'd have my assistant Naoko do it for me, but seeing as how its 5am, and hes passed out, i need more help!

Im looking for 3-5 people to test the early alpha, give feedback, find spelling/grammar errors, and just to get the word out there that this project is happening! If you'd like to apply for the early Alpha, please post below, message me on here (preferred method of communication), or on the DA page. 

As i said though, this is only the early Alpha (now 1.6). There are bound to be quite a few grammar errors, no art to speak of, not a drop of music or a single sound effect (though we may have a musician willing to help us!), and possibly some problems with the game itself (Choice trees not working, missing triggers). Even the pacing is probably going to have some problems (as writing is not my strong suit, and the script is still undergoing a state of flux as to where me and Naoko are going to place events). But this is why i'm looking for early feedback!

I want to make this series one of the greats! So anything you can do to help out is more than appreciated! If you know an artist, put me in contact with them! If you know a musician, see if they mind doing a little work. And thank you for reading, and i look forward to any replies i may receive!

Update! Were up to 1500 lines of code, and 6 choice trees with full consequences mapped! Nearly 1000 screens of dialogue, with a total of over 15,000 words in them!

1345447132.0,8,self.visualnovels,yihqx,Period english translation has been out for a week now. Thoughts and opinions? ,Cactu4r,8,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/yihqx/period_english_translation_has_been_out_for_a/,"I don't believe I've played a Little Witch game before this. I really enjoyed the different art style. I just have to wonder about their obsession with loli. 

It's hard to miss that they have an obsession with it. The oldest heroine which is in her 20's is the youngest looking sprite. The most non-loli heroine, well I'll have to stop there as to not spoil it for people but the ones who've played the student council path knows. Then there is the one that's still essentially in middle school. The other heroines aren't all that filled out either but they aren't as bad as the previously mentioned. I don't mind it and I'm not griping about it but they just kind of made it the main theme of the girls so it's at the front of everyone's minds so why not being it up? 

As for the game, there is a bit of light drama in each path. Some paths have a bit heavier but it's mostly a light drama dating sim. Once you have your common route saves, it takes about 4 hours for each heroine. 8 heroines total. 2 you have to unlock. The ones you have to unlock, you have to start a new game rather than loading a save if you want to hit their paths after they are unlocked. 

Opinion part. 4 really good paths. Asahi, Aoi, Kohane, and Rin. The rest were mildly entertaining at best. The translation is top notch. Haven't looked if it's a professional or fan translation but it seemed perfect. The character design is awkward at first because it's so different but when I got used to it, I really fell in love with it. 

The H scenes aren't exactly necessary but I felt a few of them added to the story plus they have a bit of dialogue during them. Not important dialogue but interesting dialogue that adds to the path you're on so it was hard for me to skip through all the ""Nggg agh ooh oh yeah Mitsuki"" stuff. 

The protagonist is your average school kid. Boring through most of the game but he still has his good moments where it's meant to convey empathy for him worked to a degree so it wasn't hard to feel like you are him in most instances. The comic relief best friend wasn't dull. Reminded me of Sunohara (Clannad) Watashi (?)(Da Capo 2). 

This game is nothing more than a date sim. It is above average. The quality is excellent. The music is great. The feel is great. It took a few hours to really get myself into the story but once I did, I couldn't stop going to the next scenario as soon as I finished one up. 

All in all, I had fun. I haven't played a light hearted VN lately and if you're looking for one, I'd suggest to try this one out. ",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,False,,,True,t3_yihqx,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/yihqx/period_english_translation_has_been_out_for_a/,

""An uninhabited, sealed off city, abandoned 30 years ago after a sudden biochemical warhead strike. The deserted ruins are ruled by autonomous battle drones.
And there, you meet a young woman whose name is Reverie. A member of the planetarium’s help staff who continued to wait for customers for thirty years.""


Now don't get me wrong - I love Key. I think Clannad is better than bread. I fought all three of those stupid shadow creatures in Little Busters. When Rewrite gets translated, I'll probably vanish for a week or three.


Notice anything common about those VNs? They're all disgustingly long - over forty hours long. And, at least for the first two, their stories are bound around a single point, a single idea. That's what I've always liked about Key VN's. Aside from all the silly dating sim business, there's always an underlying idea that drives everything else. They're not *just* stories about chasing after high-school girls - they aspire to be more than that ( - although, they're sure as hell about high-school girls, don't get me wrong).


So, with all this in mind -  I didn't really care for Planetarian. Yeah, shocking. I didn't care for it because the VN revolves around that old moe schtick that we've all seen a million times over: here's a weak, emotionally naive girl, and she needs your protection. Even though Key compulsively indulges in the moe stereotype, their characters usually given the chance to rise above their helplessness to develop and grow. Nagisa [ ](/s ""goes from being utterly fragile to being very self-sufficient""), as does Rin (and the main protagonist of Kanon too, if I recall).


It's not like Planetarian doesn't give Reverie a backstory - but she has such a one-dimensional inorganic constancy that I never really buy into her as someone I want to care about. She's a very transparent character. Very likeable. Very predictable and uninteresting. The result? The last few moments ends up seeming melodramatic for no good reason at all.

But, hey, that's just my opinion.


Mind you - there's a plethora of things that Planetarian does right. The world itself is quite convincing, and there's an interesting dichotomy between the rough protagonist and the pure Reverie. In a way, the robot seems more human than the protagonist - there's something poetic in that. From the main character, we get the most character development and internal struggle - although I think it comes too late in the story for it to make any difference.


Other fun questions: did that whole repeating monologue thing with Reverie work? What are your thoughts about the art style? Is the insani translation group cool, or supercool?

I feel like the small gap made for localized otome visual novels will close, but it was nice while it lasted.  I thought the localization was done well and so far I've only done Okita's route and will go for Saito, Heisuke, and Kazama's route and that's about it.

While doing Saito's route, I realized I missed a lot of things while sticking with Okita.  I guess pursuing a tuberculosis victim would affect story exploration...  Not like I have any complaints with that.  Okita had an appealing voice, but in reality I wouldn't pursue a guy who kept joking about killing left and right.  Good thing he warmed up, but I was so sad when I first got the bad ending and I was like ""WTF MAN, NO...NOOOOO"".  Then I realized my mistake and got the good ending, but I was still sad ; __ ;

I mostly liked the characters (hell, even douche-wad extraordinaire Shinji got a surprising amount of pity out of me at the end of UBW), the action, and the general plot; it's just that the tone and atmosphere of it get so dreadfully depressing.

I'm not saying this is really its fault... mostly. Maybe it could have presented the themes and ideas it was going for in a way that didn't kill my mood so much. But that's more of a gripe than a real complaint. Objectively, I recognize that it's executing those themes pretty damn well. It's just that I find myself not caring.

1372493988.0,8,self.visualnovels,1haw4w,Unlimited is done! My thoughts...,Actawesome,9,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1haw4w/unlimited_is_done_my_thoughts/,"So, after only a week or so more I've finally finished Unlimited. It was eh...well...for lack of a better word, aight. There are some things I noted as done well, and some logical nitpicks that pissed me off just a smidgen. Overall it was much more enjoyable than Extra, though I might be feeling a little Stockholm syndrome from spending so much time with these characters.

Let me address the high and low parts of the story. My favorite was the Cumulative Combat exam on the island. Some other notable parts were the very beginning, piloting the TSF for the first time, and the ending, which was Meiya's for me. Of course this time I pretty much skipped the H scene, seeing as I knew it had little reference to anything else and I wanted to fap to something else. I liked that she had Takeru's kid, though I sort of wondered how she didn't get preggers when they did it the first time. Oh well. The lowest scenes for me was when Tama shot the missle from the roof. I don't know, that whole speech Takeru gave, the scene itself, everything just seemed kind of cliché. For some reason I found myself cringing a bit during that part. I liked the little game guy arc (it happened with Meiya) but it strikes me weird how Yuuko didn't just take it away when he was in the detention barracks.

What I did like is that the main character didn't start battling the BETA right away like this was some sort of Evangelion or Gurren Lagann. Instead they put a large emphasis on how much of a city boy he was and explained in detail the training he'd done to become stronger. Now that all this world building is out of the way, I hope it's put to full use in Alternative.

Seeing as I'm about to start what most consider the greatest VN of all time, I've got some minor speculation:

-When Tsuyomi said Takeru was dead she was referring to the Takeru in the Beta World. I don't see how this would affect much of anything.

-They've been shoving it down our throats that Sumika and Kasumi are connected via that brain in that one room. I don't know what this has to do with anything, but definitely Alternative IV. I can only vaguely guess what Alternative IV was supposed to be: some sort of device that connects our world with the ones that have the Beta in it? 

-Sometime during Alternative Takeru is going to find a way to get back to the Extra world. I still remember Sumika saying that he was talking nonsense about other worlds.

I've only got one question before starting, and there might not even be an answer to this. Which routes were canon in each game? When Takeru started sexxing up Meiya during Unlimited he had a brief flashback to his time banging her in Extra, but remarks that he doesn't remember doing it. Also at the very beginning they show the whole bathing scene confession battle between Meiya and Sumika. Did Takeru actually go through any of the endings of Extra, or was he transported right before they actually occurred? I'd much prefer if Sumika's or Meiya's route happened, but since Takeru mentioned he was a virgin in Unlimited, I doubt it.

If Extra was a shitstain comedy that I'd give 3/10, then Unlimited is twice as good, a 6/10. I'm quite excited to finally start this Alternative I've heard so much about..Thanks for reading. If Alternative ever makes my brain shit rainbows and my tears cry pigs, I'll make another thread and update it whenever I've read each segment. 

Another (meta) note: I'm actually dealing with a lot of personal stuff at the moment. Trying to get off this shitty drug called Xanax (and using the times I don't feel like a zombie to play Muv Luv) and I might have some sort of surgery in the next few weeks.

[Spoilers]",Wolfiexe,8,0,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1amqt2/just_finished_999_nine_hours_nine_persons_nine/,"Ok so I'd been meaning to get round to this one for a while as the synopsis for it interested me, and I like the whole survival and escape themes that are involved. I just finished it around 20 minutes ago I'm still in a mix between mind-blown and confusion. 

I think through the course of the entire thing, my favourite characters were Snake and Seven. Snake because I found him really interesting early on and was heavily anticipating to find out more about him and what happened to him in the hospital bed room. Seven was just pretty damn awesome all the way through, and was one of the only characters I didn't really have any doubts about.

I started off with the COFFIN ending which wasn't great I guess, as I understood it would essentially have been the TRUE ending but I needed to make progress elsewhere first. So, my endings went in this route:

COFFIN -&gt; SUB -&gt; SUB -&gt; KNIFE -&gt; AXE -&gt; SAFE -&gt; TRUE

It was pretty incredible though, and my mind was blown on multiple occasions. The SAFE and TRUE endings in particular were awesome, intense and helped clear a ton of things up. I still have some confusion over the TRUE ending though in relation to the rest of the story...

So, from what I understand, 9 years before the start of the game was the first Nonary Game, and supposedly in this one, Akane died in the incinerator after being unable to solve the puzzle. Nine years later, the second Nonary Game began and things such as experiments, kidnappings and other mishaps were mentioned from people such as Santa and Seven, in particular there was the mention of a girl who died 9 years ago. Then through the use of morphogenetic fields, she connected with Junpei between the 9 year gap to solve the incinerator room puzzle and ended up escaping with the rest of the kids and Seven.

This is where I get a little confused though. Scenes like where Seven would talk about the game 9 years ago, and where Santa would mention his sister had died and how he couldn't protect her...Don't they directly conflict with the fact that Akane/June is there at the time? I sort of understand that the POV of the narrative orbits around her mostly as she's directing Junpei on the right path (I think), but it's all leaving me very confused.

All in all though, it was a brilliant VN which left me satisfied but still a little confused I guess. The very last scene also left me stumped with what appeared to be Alice stood in the desert hitch-hiking. Was that thrown in for some comic relief or is that somehow...canon? I wasn't really sure, and felt maybe it could've done without it.

Edit: Just minutes after posting this I came across this [Answers page](http://aksysgames.com/999/answers) on the 999 website which is answering a lot of my questions. I understood that Santa and Akane were working together but didn't even consider that he wasn't telling the truth to avoid a paradox. The whole idea that Akane's illness / headaches represent an incorrect route is also really fascinating.

If anything it's making me even more interested to find out more. If spoilers can be avoided, is Virtue's Last Reward considered a sequel as such? Or is it more of just a similar scenario or maybe set in the same world?

It's all spoilers so I'm not going to black out anything; this topic is for people who either have finished the game or just don't care about being spoiled. If you don't belong to either group, this thread is verboten to you.



Summary:

First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed this title, the story was involving, the artwork pleasing to the eye and the eroge content suitably sexy without being too extreme or unrealistic. Bonus for some nice voice-actress work--wow, I wonder how they felt doing the sex scenes? I'd be red in the face during the recording sessions either way. Hehehe.

 The structure was fairly simple since the chapters are pretty much linear in sequence so I followed each branch in order of length (Tsubaki, Kanon, Mizuha, Haru). Notable plot points: as you go deeper into the story, more and more plot surprises and twists pop-up, hence Haru's end is really the story's complete and true end while all the others are technically ""dead"" ends in terms of plot; you realize that the MC, Kyousuke is a bit of a dick, but he has good reason to be once you read his tragic backstory; since Kyousuke is a cold-hearted adopted son of a ruthless yakuza lord, the plot is essentially how the 4 girls (plus one side character) use their wiles to win his heart and free him from the chains of materialistic selfishness as well as achieve their own, individual, happy endings.

Analysis of the Endings

Primarily, I wanted to talk about the various chapter endings with each girl and how this story pretty much goes from bad to worse for just about all of them the further you go into it! There are clear winners and losers, sadly, so there is almost no way for everyone to be happy at the end. In some endings, the story is very tragic for some side-characters. To make this clearer, I've decided to break down the endings in the form of a relative score chart based on happiness/fulfillment for each major person in the VN. And for one character, Yuki, who is also on the cover, every end is basically tragic since she is an un-lockable route (except for Mizuha's bad end sequence where you get to bone her after tossing aside Mizuha like a used condom, but you end up literally killing each other in a bloodbath). Yuki is doomed because she sold her soul to Maou long before the VN start, simply not going to jail is her best possible ending.

Essentially, the overall scale of happiness is inverse to Haru's good ending--the closer to Haru's happiness/fulfillment you achieve, the relative happiness of just about everyone else goes down! Except for Maou himself; in fact, Haru's best ending is also the best Maou can achieve given the choices.  However, Haru's ending is her only possible good ending, all her other endings suck even more if you don't finish her route!

Note on my happiness scale -- range is from -5 to +5 and is based on relative, not absolute factors (in other words, not compared to any potential sequels or additional info or alternate universes, etc.). It's also a subjective scale, weighted by my personal feelings and biases. Please feel free to add your own comments/suggestions to my weighting. The reason I am using this scale is to quantify how, objectively, the plot is tragically backwards (but still awesome and entertaining).

Tsubaki Route Happiness/Fulfillment Results

Tsubaki : (+5)  -- She gets the love of her life, her family gets the to keep their house, though they sell it later, they make a modest profit. Life is beautiful. She played it a little too loose at times (Kyousuke even warns her once that she could be mistaken for an ""easy"" woman when she agrees to hang out at his place) but her earnestness saves her from losing a point.

Kyousuke : (+4) -- He achieves stalemate against his yakuza father, but he is still in debt, so -1 for that, however, he gets to keep his mother, has a healthy relationship based on trust and honor. Gonzou considers him a sheep but so what, the guy is a thug.
                    
Haru: (-4)  -- She is defeated by Maou, loses the love of her life that she has been searching for to another girl, she never plays the violin again, and probably ends up either dead or a lonely old cat lady. I'd make it -5 if it was certain that Maou kills her at some point.

Kanon: (0 ) -- she is a selfish, spoiled brat at the beginning and remains so with this chapter; she pretty much gains nothing, nor loses anything at this point.

Mizuwa: (0) -- since so little of her is seen at this point, essentially she is no better or worse.

Maou: (+1) -- only for not being caught and being a mystery, otherwise he fails to achieve all his ultimate goals; it is assumed his main goal has a time limit since their father is on death row.

Yuki: (-3) -- She starts off negative because she already sold her soul to evil for revenge plus she never even gets to do anything in this chapter.

Kyousuke's mom : (+3) She is mentally unstable but now has a daughter in law and a wholesome family who can help his son take care of her.

Kyousuke's Dad: (0) He remains on death row for a crime he was guilty of so he doesn't deserve anything else than no change. From an absolute scale, he's screwed no matter what.

Society at large: (0) From society's standpoint, it's a slight positive, a new nuclear family has been created, no one died, no major overt criminal activity, usual corruption continues.


--------------

Kanon Route Results

Tsubaki: (-1) --  She fails to gain her love interest, her family is broke and in debt after losing their home. Overall, she's still has a chance at a good life because she is a decent person at heart otherwise I'd make it -2.

Kyousuke: (+3) -- He allows himself to fall in love to a famous, beautiful, strong-willed girl. He is still in debt but his prospects are decent since Gonzou gives him some begrudging credit for taming his daughter. However, he is still a bit of a sheep and his love for Kanon is mired by potential scandal.

Haru: (-4)  -- She is once again defeated by Maou, loses the love of her life that she has been searching for to another girl, she never plays the violin again, and probably ends up either dead or a lonely old cat lady. I'd make it -5 if it was certain that Maou kills her at some point.

Kanon: (+4) -- She has reconciled with her mother, achieved inner piece and matured into a decent human being. She found love, although she practically had to serve herself on a platter naked in order for him to fall for her, but it worked out (hence, the loss of a point).

Mizuwa : (0) -- Still pretty neutral for the most part, though she gets to see her sister now.

Maou: (+1) -- Just barely a plus one for still not being caught or revealed, but his plot ultimately failed. 

Yuki: (-2) -- She is still doomed, but at least she got a chance to do something. (She is doomed because she has already entered a life of crime; even if she isn't caught, she has soiled her adoptive father's honor and she knows it)

Kyousuke's Mom: (+1) -- There is a light at the end of her tunnel but still too many unknowns, plus can Kanon really be a dutiful daughter-in-law when her father is the man who took her son away?

Kyousike's Dad; (0) -- Still on death row.

Society at Large: (0) Slightly negative, because of scandal and corruption plus yakuza activity but no overall change in society.

---------

Mizuwa Route Results

Tsubaki: (-1) -- Same as Kanon route.

Kyousuke: (+3) -- Although he wasn't really interested, he allows himself to fall in love with a very attractive girl with good prospects. She will be a strong and successful wife, though it took her a while to mature. He's made more inroads with the yakuza, so his cash debt is a lot lower now, though it means he will have to deal with Gonzou and crew more in the future. His mother is still an unknown factor, but at least he can take care of her financially.

Haru: (-4) -- She's still pretty much screwed. Her association with the yakuza now may help her survival prospects, or not. Dunno.

Kanon: (-1) -- She tried but failed to win over Kyousuke. She practically served herself to him but he rebuffed her at every turn. She remains selfish and insecure and doesn't reconcile with her mother.

Mizuwa: (+3.5) -- She has reconciled with both her father and her estranged sister and finally nabbed the boy she has loved for years with her sister's help and several more years of self-improvement. However, she hasn't achieved perfect happiness because her sister is a jailed murderer and there were lonely times when Yuki was missing; Kyousuke had a bit of coldness and distance towards her, though he seems to truly respect her as a woman now and not as a fuck-toy.

Maou: (0) -- Although he still remains a mystery and he has made more inroads toward his ultimate plans, however since one of his plans is the release of his father from death row and nothing seems to have happened in that regard, this is an over-all no-gain for him. 

Yuki: (-1) -- She has succeeded in her goals: she has avenged the murder of her mother, she has found some measure of peace with her father and has set-up her sister to live a happy life, a life she can no longer have as a convicted murderer who has soiled her name and given up any honor for revenge.

Kyousuke's Mom: (+1) -- Not much hope for happiness but at least some consistency, similar situation as to Kanon's route.

Kyousuke's Dad : (0) -- Still on death row.

Society at Large: (-1) Crimes have been committed and not all punished. People died, even if they deserved it. Yakuza activity has been rampant.

I, too, believe that love of boobs will be the cause of world peace.  I found it worth the amount of time it took to go back through the games to finish the quests and getting all the friends.

Overall, I enjoyed the game.  I think my favorite character, outside of the main heroines would be Esaka, particularly during the Terra route where we finally discover the reason why he randomly yells sometimes.

My favorite heroine is Shizuru, which is a shame, because her route is, in my opinion, the worst route in the game.  It started out good, but it started going downhill once she wakes up from being in the hospital.  As skilled as Kotarou becomes in other routes, he just seemed pathetic in hers.

I found Chihaya's route to be enjoyable, though it went a bit heavy on the fighting scenes, something which I would have liked to see spaced a bit better throughout the other routes (Kotori's route had very few)

I think Lucia's route was my favorite.  Even though I don't normally like tsundere characters, I think they did a good job with it.  

Akane's route was great, but I think it fell apart at the end.  Nothing specific, it just didn't mesh with me.

I found Kitori's route alright.  Overall, it felt lacking.

As far as the Moon and Terra route, I really didn't see what the point was in separating them.  It would have made more sense to me to combine the two into one route.  

The only thing I really didn't care for was the way the Terra route handled the text aspect, with it taking up the entire screen.  I would have preferred they kept it the same as with other routes.

One thing I'm unsure of is Kotarou's power.  In Kitori's route, it seems like his rewrite abilities and aurora come from being partly a familiar and having part of the Key's ribbon inside him, while others seem to imply that he naturally had the rewrite ability, but gained the aurora from Kagari.  And then Terra, it seems that he has both naturally (the aurora coming after he rewrites himself towards the end)

Is this due to the Earth going through re-evolution with each route and so he changes slightly each time?  Or is something else the reason?",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,False,,,True,t3_18mon1,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/18mon1/just_finished_rewrite_spoilers_all_routes_and/,

 * Fate/stay night: Réalta Nua Patch -- Adds additional ending (No clue how to tell if this is installed easily)
 * Fate/stay night: Uncensored patch -- Removes blurring in some images (Obvious during game)
 * Cross Channel: Tower of Friends -- Adds additional scenarios (Second executable with 2 options on starting a new game)
 * Umineko no Naku Koro ni: PS3fication patch -- Huge update with additional sound and improved images (Noticeable graphics improvements right when starting)

EDIT:
Ok...for everyone, who will come to this problem, I have found a solution (I will post that on forum once the admin approves me):

1) What you need to do is to save before the crash, then exit the game.

2) In the game folder, there is a folder named 'Plugins' and in it there is a file 'mlhookv2.rpo'. Move the file away. Just renaming the file won't work, it needs to be deleted from the original folder.

3) Start the game. The game will now be untranslated. Load the saved game. While the game is now completely in Japanese, it shouldn't be that hard to find the correct buttons.

4) Skip to the part just after the (now gone) crash and save and quit the game.

5) Copy the 'mlhookv2.rpo' file back to 'Plugins' folder.

6) Run, load and enjoy the game

I'm pretty confident where I am, so it does not need to be restricted to only the ones with basic Japanese. I might take some time to figure out the vocabulary using a dictionary but I will do my best. I just hope it wouldn't get too philosophical, although it might be a fun challenge too.

The more voices it has the better, but again, I'll accept it either way.

If I understood correctly, Sumika got her powers due to the G-bomb explosions. She could ""summon"" Takeru to her world and loop him when he did not choose her. After all alternative stuff, Takeru returns to his original world, which has been modified. But here is the thing - I don't know if my thought process is correct, so if I'm wrong then by all means, correct me.
If Sumika could change Takeru's original world to a better one, then why couldn't she change HER world? I mean it just seems absurd to me, why would she loop him all the time when she could make Takeru choose her? Her powers obviously were able to change the past (Meyia and her sister at the ending - Sumika had to change the past to prevent Yuuhi's death). Or is not the original world? If yes then how the hell did Takeru get there? I mean, according to Professor's theory, he could only go back to his original world because he remembered it, so he couldn't possibly go back to the another one.
So my point is - If Sumika was able to change the world's past, why didn't she do that?

On April 15, 2010, roughly a month after Cross Days was released, BBC News reported on the spread of a virus name Kenzero masquerading on peer-to-peer (P2P) networks as unlicensed copies of erotic games;[29] one of which, according to software developer SPAMFighter, included Cross Days.[30] Users tricked into installing the virus, termed a form of ""ransomware"" in the report, were asked for personal information and then had all of their web history posted to a blog, operated by shell corporation Romancing Inc., for public access.[29] NetAgent, a property rights company, reported that at least 5,510 people were collectively infected.[31] Those wishing to have their information removed could do so after acknowledging to viewers that they had attempted to download the game illegally. SPAMfighter has noted that the intrusive nature of the trojan was ""in fact explained in [the software's] terms of service"".[30]

I said that I'd have this thread up on Sunday, but I'm not sure if I'll have internet access then, so I'm posting this early. I'm gonna post a huge-ass synopsis of the prologue as a comment so its massive doesn't make the thread hard to navigate. I'll wax lyrical about the second red leaf ('An Invitation Carried on the Wind') a bit later when I get a chance.







***RUNNING CHARACTER LIST - PROLOGUE***


**Layer 1 -'Real' World**


Faceless Storyteller: ?

Faceless Listener: Alice


**Layer 2 -'Shinjuku' World**

Office-worker: Amenomori

Prostitute: Nagatsuki

Restaurant Manager: Kariya

Med Student: Mayuzumi 

?: Akeru

**Layer 3 - 'Forest' World**

Real Alice: Storyteller/Listener Alice

Alice in Wonderland/Guest -&gt; Stranger : Amenomori

Mad Hatter: Nagatsuki

March Hare: Kariya

Dormouse: Mayuzumi 

Etrangere -&gt; None: Akeru

**THINGS TO THINK ABOUT**

- So we got two nested stories, at least. On the outside, we have the faceless narrator and Alice. Inside, we have the rest of the cast, sans the faceless narrator. You might argue that the 'Forest' is a third layer,  another story underneath the mundane Shinjuku story. **We also can't trust anything below the first layer.** Alice and narrator-dude keep fucking around with the continuity, revising how things should be and how they need to resolve. To borrow the words of a wise man: what the shit.


- A lot of 'what' questions are kinda futile at this point of the story. What's a gift? What's the forest? What's a riddle? Why these particular people? I trust the VN to be kind enough to my narrative sensibilities to at least partially answer these questions. What's far more interesting to ask is **why we start off examining Amenomori's neuroses, and what her connection is with Alice**. They seems rather opposite in many ways. Alice is the spitting image of order and decorum. Amemori can barely contain herself. They have wildly different senses of style. And what's up with the narrator screwing up her name? A typo? I don't even know.


- This prologue is hemorrhaging Lewis Carrol. Alice in Wonderland is rather popular source material to draw upon - but what the hell is Reepicheep doing here? That dude's from Narnia, not Wonderland **Is the Forest maybe some sort of weird fantasy land rife with western story references?** You gotta admit - it's all a bit weird.


- Akeru has serious beef with Alice. That kid knows somethin', and he ain't talking.



Next thread on the 19th - we'll do the next red leaf, Shinjuku Drifters. It's a real fun chapter, but a bit long. Enjoy!

My Recommendations:

**Clannad**: Very complete and satisfying VN, although I did not care at all for the main girl the main plot was very good. The different girls had very good stories as well. Highly recommend.

The anime is good as well.

**Brass Restoration**: A simple yet interesting VN. The protagonist reminded me of KS a bit, and although I felt the main story was a tad simple minded, and the choice options in many cases pitiful, there were some specific stories which were entertaining.

**Little Busters**!: This was a tough one. I loved the main story plot, but I did not connect with the main girl, at all. HOWEVER, the other girls/paths were fantastic. I was not expecting much, but in the end it was totally worth it going through the game. (its pretty long)

**Yume Miru Kusuri - A Drug That Makes You Dream**: Now this VN is way over the top in crazy exaggerated situations, and extremely pornographic, however, there are some scenes and situations that surprised me in a very positive way. Some paths have little to no plot development in them, but as it is a short game and I do recommend it.

So when I got my friend to read a VN a few years ago, he surprisingly ended up really liking it. We jokingly threw around the idea of making a VN for fun before we graduate college, but didn't take the idea seriously at first.

But around a year and a half later, we were inspired to start writing up a story, and now two years later we ended up actually writing up a comprehensive basic outline.  We're almost done with our main route (8500 word detailed outline, so the script will probably be much longer), and it will probably be the only route considering we don't have much time left to work on the other two routes we had imagined up.

We luckily have a friend who can make some great music, and he's already started to make some music that we've requested (I can link up some of his work if requested).

---------------------------------------------------------
The big problem we're having is finding some talented artists. Unfortunately we can't really go the Katawa Shoujo route with backgrounds because our setting is rather unique, and significantly different from your typical high school setting. Same goes with the CGs. The general inspiration for the story itself is Milton's [Paradise Lost](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradise_Lost).

Anyways, we both agreed that we don't want to half-ass anything about this VN. We really hate how low quality most OEL VNs seems to be (with a few exceptions), so our goal is to make something at least on par with Katawa Shoujo or Cradle Song.

The last thing we'd want is our project to end up like this [OEL VN](http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2011/05/19/curse-of-slate-rock-manor-truly-terrifying/) x_x

So any suggestions on how to find any good artists? I can detail parts of the story if anybody here is interested. After all, I'd say we have 80-85% of our route set in stone.

---------------------------------------------------------
**TL;DR** we're looking for a good artist because we don't like crappy OEL VNs, and don't want to end up making one of them. Any suggestions?

--------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT: Synopsis. Warning, it's kind of lengthy. Stuff is also subject to change, though most of it is set in stone**

The year is 2097. World War III breaks out, consuming the entire modern world in a bitter battle over the scarce natural resources that have yet to be tapped. However, this war is short lived and only four years into the war, a supernatural phenomenon instantaneously melts down much of the northern Polar Ice Cap. The resulting flood consumes all the major coastlines of the world in a matter of hours. Billions perish, and human civilization is thrown back to an era that hasn't been seen for centuries.

Amidst this chaotic world, ancient societies of magic-wielding sorcerers move about, shrouded in secrecy. They slowly help rebuild human civilization from behind the scenes, and now, over 450 years later, humanity has restored much of it's former glory.

On an island city in this new modern age, a young man named Alastor makes his residence. In his early twenties, he is a self-made man who has worked his way up in the business world by his own merit. This man has only one mission; to seek revenge upon his father, who abandoned him and his older sister after putting her through severe magi training, leaving her brain-dead and hospitalized. He carefully plans his revenge, which includes conducting meticulous research, spying on his father's magi associates, and thoroughly researching Eternum, the magical society run by his father that governs from the shadows.

And yet, there is far more going on in the shadows than Alastor is aware of. Mysterious assassinations, epic battles between magi to the death, strange phenomena within the city, and a curious connection to the mysterious phenomenon that caused the Great Calamity over 450 years ago.

Yet strangest of all, a seemingly young woman who goes by the name of Aurae confronts this young man, accusing him of murdering magi throughout the city. There is more to her than meets the eye, and her sly, smart attitude proves to be quite worrisome.

In this world of magic and science, where the modern world and myth collide, what is the truth that has begun to unfold within this city?",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,True,,,True,t3_macej,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/macej/trying_to_make_a_oel_visual_novel/,

Second, I thought the music really dropped the ball. A lot of times the music is what keeps me playing for a long time, but it really didn't help keep me interested. The only song I enjoyed was the credits song.  
Third, I really felt like Tsubaki and Shiratori's routes weren't even necessary. I went through all of them and found those two to be snoozers. However, Kanon's (I held my breath at the end) and Haru's were great.

I'm not new to visual novels, but I typically don't play romance-based ones. I find them generally uninteresting, especially when compared to other genres. However, I followed Katawa Shoujo since the project first started and only recently downloaded the full version, where I had previously played the Act I demo when it was released.

First of all, I love it. I've never played an ELVN that was so well executed. That being said, I've noticed over the past few days since I've started (playing about an hour a night) I've been quite a bit more emotionally exhausted than I typically am. It's kind of hard to explain, really. I'm typically fairly well composed, but have been stressing over the story quite a bit more than I should, even if it is just a game.

Don't get me wrong, I think it's beautifully written and am having quite a bit of fun with it - maybe I just don't want it to end, knowing that it's finite.

(Spoilers)",tommyth3cat,8,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1braca/finished_my_first_routekotori_in_rewrite_looking/,"So I finished Kotori's route today.  I loved her quirky personality in the common route so it was clear she'd be my first choice.  It was extremely emotional and set the bar pretty high for the rest of the routes.  It seems that her route is specifically meant for a first time clear as she does a lot of explaining of the world around you and why things are the way they are, but at the same time she is clueless to what exactly is happening around her with the numerous factions all converging in on her.  After finishing it I was curious how all the plots played out around her so it does feel like the first stepping stone.

**What I'm curious about is just whos side everyone is on in the Occult club?**  I may be jumping to conclusions but it seems as though Kotori was the odd man out with at least 3 factions trying to stop/kill her unless I am misunderstanding.

That kind of irked me a bit because assuming each girl works for each one of these factions then they went from school buddies to mortal enemies of Kotori in a heartbeat.  I'm sure it's more complicated than that and from Kotori's ending it seems at the very least Shizuru has no desire to hurt them.

Am I way off base here?  After the friendly common route it seems like everyone goes their separate ways(which makes sense as it's their route) but from my limited perspective it seems like it puts the heroines at odds with each other.

Final question, any recommendations on the next route to take?  I got the Shizuru route unlock when finishing Kotori.

I recently finished Umineko no Naku Koro ni episodes 1-4 and am now waiting for the 5-8 to be patched with the PS3 graphics and such. In the meantime, I need to discuss it with others and get across how much I enjoyed going through it.

I went into it because I was a fan of the Higurashi anime, but I had heard bad things about the Umineko anime so I ended up looking elsewhere. Over the course of the past two months, I've been sucked into the story and the characters so much. Within a few hours I'd already grown to most of the characters and began to remember the massive cast that it'd introduced to me.

Episode 1[](/s "" was brilliant to start things off, and overall it was pretty damn scary too. I was messaging a friend telling him of my progress as I went along and I remember getting to the point a CG with Maria having a really eerie expression. Man that was terrifying, and alot of my enjoyment from the first episode was down to it being pretty eerie and confusing for the most part, with me eager to know what was happening. I love how it all kept building up as people got separated due to suspicion and people were getting picked off one after the other."")

Episode 2[](/s "" left me excited and once again, I wasn't disappointed. Straight off hearing the opening 'Chikai Hibiki no Igureja', I was raring to go. This was when the whole Battler vs. Beatrice thing starts happening which I found incredible. The battle of wits was always my favourite moments, and how it all related to closed rooms and bizarre murders. I began to find it less scary and more entertaining to see how people react to the situations, and things also started to get much more supernatural it seemed with Kanon and Shannon using their blade/shield things. Seeing Battler pretty much give up near the end wasn't expected, but it was great to see him make a return in the Tea Party segment."")

Episode 3[](/s ""was probably my favourite episode (partly down to Ronove being a brilliant character). When it started, I was getting the feeling that it was starting pretty slowly, or that maybe my interest in watching the same scenario was dropping ever so slightly, but that was all thrown out of the window soon enough. EVA Beatrice was...terrifying, and her faces creeped me out endlessly. One of my favourite scenes was when Rudolf and Kyrie were fighting against a seperate Stake of Purgatory each, but the biggest surprise would be how I was fooled the entire time by Beatrice. My opinions of her were changing throughout, and I thought massive character development was happening in a good way. A chill ran down my spine when Beatrice and Virgilia's faces changed when telling Battler to sign the contract towards the end, and my mind really was just blown."")

Episode 4[](/s ""probably took me the longest to get going for whatever reason. It wasn't that I found the Ange sections at her school and such tedious at all, but I was in such a rush from the last episode that I really wanted to see more Beatrice &amp; Battler at that point. Another creepy face from Maria appeared, as well as a hilarious scene involving Goat-san. Aside from all that, the Tea Party in episode 4 stands up there one of my favourite scenes from all 4 episodes so far. It was just epic to see Battler and Beatrice have a showdown recollecting the past 4 games and try to prove/disprove everything with the battle between the red and blue text."")

The soundtrack to Umineko is also phenomenal. The composer (or composers if multiple) has really done a fantastic job. There are so many stand-outs to me, such as [Black Liliana](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7QQsRcfdFI), [DreamEndDischarger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDMpVwCsTy8) and also [Door of Summer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sxfABkV3oU), but I don't think there was a single track I got sick of hearing.

Can't wait to get started on episodes 5-8 anyway, and as someone who hasn't played a whole lot of VN's (Umineko only being my 3rd or so), it'd be great to hear some similar recommendations to Umineko! \^^

1. How is the Service? Reliable?
2. How long did it normally take for a backorder to process?
3. How much does the average Visual Novel weigh?
4. Were you happy with purchasing off them?
And the optional Question: 
Is there a better (cheaper) site than AmiAmi that Aussies can purchase off?

I'm used to KEY games having routes for each heroine, and that appears to be how this game operates, but according to the synopsis of the game it's split into two halves, so I'm not sure how it's gonna do things. I also haven't had many girl (or in this case Akane) specific choices for anyone but Kotori yet, so I'm unsure how I should proceed. I love Kotori, but I'd like to do Akane's route more right now. My game just ends when I try to dodge the kotori options, though.


So my questions are as follows;

Does this game use the individual route for each heroine system like Little Busters or Clannad did?

Do I need to choose these kotori options in order to progress through the game far enough to get into routes, or could my investigation and club activitiy decisions be giving me the bad end?



If you can't answer those without spoilers then I'll just find out myself, but I'd like to know if possible.

Here's a small snippet of what DH is about from the blog:  


[Dizzy Hearts Blog](http://lupiesoft.blogspot.com/)  

+ *Dizzy Hearts is a 18+ futanari romance Visual Novel featuring the story of Seriva, a young girl from the sun-filled land of Assard, leaving home for the first time, in the tradition of her people. 
She meets the young Princess Mercilia a hermaphroditic ""fiore"" who is at odds with her duty to become queen.*  

-

Dizzy Hearts is an eroge with a strong romance theme, with elements of a G/G or yuri game and futanari. The universe this game exists in is also different from usual, with a much more high fantasy, pre-modern feel. Currently the aim of my game is to create a story that I feel is strongly underrepresented in VNs, and in erotica in general. That is, a more serious take on the futanari story with more emphasis on reasonable proportions and erotic themes, rather than hyper, or other size fetishes. While they've been done before, they are very rare.
 
- 
  
Games/stories you see today with futa have it just for the sake of futa. They are often fairly extreme. So DH is not only my personal aim to do something different with the medium, but different with the futanari genre. Because the game deals with things of a highly sexual nature (i.e a hermaphroditic elven race) the game is restricted for mature audiences. However, I hope this isn't as a problem. If you're like me, you lament the lack of serious games that try and tell a story, and that sex is just randomly thrown in because people
expect it to be, not because it has significant plot elements. I want DH to be different.

-

Because I'm both doing the art, managing the programming and doing the scenario writing. I have a lot on my plate. I recently announced that the scenario for the game (3 medium sized chapters), is complete. And now that i'm focus focusing on doing the writing for chapter 1, and pushing for a beta to begin around February 1st.

To aid this, the compiler also generates a warning file of all the bugs it picks up in the users text file.

The principle is very simple. In the engine you can either have one of two  things. 

An object stores data against a handle, the object also has a unique name. So for example you can have an object called Player1 and store Health=100 and FavouriteColour=Red in this object. With Health and FavouriteColour being the handles, and 100 and Red being their respective stored data.

The second object is a Script. It is a bit more up in the air than the object, but essentially it is what will be written on the screen. Currently you are able to query objects for their data via their handle. i.e. Placing VAR=Player1.Health in the text, so when the game is run whatever Player1.Health is at that time will be printed. I plan to include the ability to actually modify object variables from script, as well as a simple form of logic to control the story flow from script to script.

So an example file to compile right now is:
OBJECT=Player1
Health=100
FavouriteColour=Red

SCRIPT=Beach
Wow! VAR=Player1.FavouriteColour is my favourite colour too!

Exciting because, well, Battler is pretty much wizard Buddha. It's disappointing because I actually had a fairly large hunch that Battler was the culprit since episode 2, but thought it was too ridiculous to be true. It wasn't until Natsuhi got the phone call that I realized the Battler-Culprit theory could actually be true. After all, Knox's 7th says that the detective cannot be the culprit.

There is still a suspicion in my mind that Battler is hiding something else, though. When everyone was looking at the scene of Hideyoshi's death, Battler actually stopped Erika from looking in the closet where Natsuhi was. It was almost as if Battler didn't want Natsuhi to be found.

So now that we know the *whodunnit*, all that's left is the *Whydunnit* and the *Howdunnit*. The howdunnit would take more than a few reddit posts to explain all of the locked rooms, so I'll explain my theory on the whydunnit:

If Battler is truly the adopted child of Natsuhi chosen by Kinzo, that would mean that he would also be the child of Krauss and the direct heir to the Ushiromiya family. So, in a sense, Battler would have inherited Kinzo's gold whether or not he solved the epitaph. Being deprived that right must be a little infuriating, eh? But I feel like this is more than an issue of money, greed is a pretty shallow motive for Ryukishi07. I mean, there is also the motive for revenge for abandonment, but that would only concern Natsuhi, why kill everyone?

Battler also never returns from Rokkenjima. Does he commit suicide, or does he sit on an island with a shit ton of gold piling up? Maybe he gets a new alias and lives in another country for the rest of his life? Even if the roundabout ways of murder made sense, what did he do with his life afterwards? It seems like the more I think about it, the less it makes sense

In any case, I'm excited to 'play' the sixth game ran by Battler. It seems like the game has shifted to Battler vs. Erika, and I'm excited to see how it plays out.

P.S. Knox is best character.

First of all, I have to praise Ryukishi for balancing the two opposing viewpoints of witch/no witch so well. I honestly have no idea whether Ange is a witch or if she's just delusional. In fact, there are a lot of thing I have no idea about after reading episode 4.

The only thing I am sure about, however, is that I can trust nothing that Battler hasn't seen with his own eyes. The Battler from episode 4, specifically. The Battler from episode 1 (the one that is currently in purgatorio) is either crazy or actually in the witch's realm, and either way cannot be trusted. Also, I believe the Tea Party (where Battler 'killed' Beatrice with the blue truth) is a delusion, and can therefore not be trusted either. After all, if we trust any other viewpoint, witches are most certainly real.

I have absolutely no theories for this Episode. Well, that's a lie; I do have an idea that a lot of the crazy things victims see are delusions brought upon by paranoia or something else. Maybe lunacy is hereditary in the Ushiromiya family, but not everyone give in to it until something happens. Either way, none of those thoughts are organized enough in order to make any solid claims. What I did put some solid effort into, however, is solving the riddle of the epitaph.

Now, before people say 'don't do that, you need to know other languages!' I know. I probably won't be able to achieve anything with wikitionary and a translator. But it never hurts to try, eh? Anyways, here's what I've got so far:

- The epitaph obviously has something to do with maria. The novel specifically pointed out that Maria shares a character in her name with the word villiage. The secret area that Eva found has to be on the island somewhere as well. The only place where these two thoughts directly intersect is where the rose wilted, but that conflicts with a different idea that I have, which is shown below.

- Ayu, the japanese word for sweetfish, is written with the kanji 鮎, which can also mean bountiful. I think the bountiful description is the key to solving this aspect. The 'bountiful river' is actually not a river, but actually some sort of path that appears bountiful, probably into the woods and to the kuwadorian (which is where I think the treasure is)

- Maria's name,  真里亞, consists of the characters meaning: True, Villiage, and Follow; in that order. Follow the True Villiage.  里, however, can also mean a few other things, among them being Surname and *Country House*. So what Maria's name could be saying is 'follow the true house' as in, kumadorian. This is why the epitaph specifically used the character 里; in order to point Maria's name out.

- The 'golden land', 黄金郷, consists of the characters for yellow, gold metal, and village. This method of writing golden land, however, is different from using the character for villiage found in Maria's name. This method uses the character 郷 instead. 郷 can mean multiple other things besides village, the most notable of them being *birthplace*. It is entirely possible that Beatrice was born in the Kuwadorian, considering hold young she appears, specifically in her non-witch clothing.

It isn't much to show for, but my guess is that there are some sort of paths or markers that make a path 'bountiful' to go to the kuwadorian and find the treasure. I would look up the kanji for kuwadorian, and whatever the guest house is called (something-dorian), but I'm trying to avoid spoilers at all costs and looking at the wiki is probably the quickest way to destroy that hope.

I might not go on to read Episode 5 right after Episode 4. After all, I have Steins;Gate as well as G-Senjou no Maou (probably butchered that spelling, but it's 6 AM and I'll be damned if I let words get in the way of my thought process) collecting dust in my VN folder. Would it be better to carry on with Chiru while thoughts are fresh in my head, or should I give my worn out brain a resting period?

1. Make sure you have the latest Realta Nua patch. You can download it [here](http://rnpatch.blogspot.com/2009/12/realta-nua-patch-version-42.html). ""Main Patch"" and ""Update 01-07-13."" Hopefully the latter hasn't changed as of your viewing.

2. READ THE INSTRUCTIONS IN THE README FOR THE PATCH. This is where I was messing up; I didn't rename the patch files when I moved them to the directory.

3. You don't need to have all the CGs; just the five endings + forty bad endings/tiger dojos.

4. When you boot up the program, you should have the big ""Last Episode"" option in the title screen, like [this](http://i.imgur.com/socL4Bd.jpg). My screen has the background for Unlimited Blade Works, so I think that's different for each person or something.

5. If you're still having problems, feel free to PM me in the next three months or so (so by 9 October 2014), because any later and I'll probably have forgotten the steps I took.

I went into this episode with the thought 'never give into witches' since it is essentially the easy route: If you believe in magic, there is no mystery and no fun aspect to reading forward. That being said, Magic puts a lot of pieces into place that would otherwise be scattered. (after all, my Homunculus argument is [getting more evidence by the chapter](http://imgur.com/dZQP0KL)) I think it's fairly plain to see that Beatrice's claim that she would disprove witches with red text was a bluff in order to get Battler to submit though, so there is no solid evidence for either argument.

Ange's backstory is still a little scattered in my mind, but here is what I have so far: She was Rudolf and Kyrie's child, but didn't meet Battler until Asumu died, which forced him to move in with Rudolf. Then she got sick and everyone except her died, leaving her in the care of Eva. Then Eva died and Ange inherited the title of Golden Witch. The only problem is, how is she going to help Battler fight the existence of witches if she pretty much time-traveled to him, making the existence of witches apparent in her eyes. 

Also, Lambda is a bitch.

Anyways, here are my current working theories. Some of them are absolutely crazy, others I have some evidence for. I don't feel too strongly about any of them, though.

* When Eva was trying to figure out the riddle of the epitaph, Beato-Eva mentioned two japanese characters specifically: 里 and 岸. The former means village, but it can also mean surname (as in, the Ushiromiya name). Latter means shore, but it's the characters cliff and edge of land smashed together into one character. Another place  where there was a cliff is where Beatrice died. I think that area is where the gold is hidden, although I'm not sure.

* Witches aren't really witches, per say, but actually illusionists. On Rokkenjima, there exists a sort of illusionary dust (or maybe a virus) that makes people see what they believe they *should* see. For instance, if someone says a giant ox man is going to appear and kill them, that's what they sense. If you've ever played Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box, it's much like that. So a lot of people had their brains 'shut off' when they thought they would die, making there no murderer and no suicide for many of the locked rooms, but rather an incident caused by enviromental factors. This dust can also make people go crazy and kill others. The source of this dust would probably be the place where the gold is stored, which would explain why Eva acted strange and fever-like after she found the gold. 

* Beato said there were only 18 people on the island, but with the illusionary dust theory, one could've actually died before stepping foot on the island, and then a 19th person would have room amongst the 18, with the family members not noticing being of the dust. The dust theory is extremely flexible, but that makes it almost a bad theory since I might rely on it to explain too much. After all, I'm only on episode III, I doubt I have all the pieces to make a full theory.

I find that in mystery stories like this where a binomial option is presented (witch/no witch, in this case) the truth lies somewhere in between. So I think the answer is not that witches don't exist, but that witches *are not what they appear*. What exactly that means, I have no idea. Hopefully I find out in the next chapter.

Just finished this one. I really enjoyed it. I thought the delivery in the novel was like an anime and I think I'm going to check out the anime. The story was neat and I felt a lot of connections between a lot of the characters. It's a shame Kuuya was just a side character! She reminded me much of Meiya from Muv-Luv. She even talked similar.  I haven't shed any tears since Muv-Luv but I surprisingly did in this one.

I didn't pay attention to the H scenes either, but I will give them credit for not making them really unrealistic and long.

Some more thoughts I've had,Ipskies,5,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1gk1h5/finished_act_ii_of_umineko_some_more_thoughts_ive/,"Since I'm a pretty rabid Higurashi fan, I like to compare Umineko to it a lot, despite the extremely small connections between the two. One thing that stuck out in my mind the most was the two titles and their significance. In Higurashi, the namesake animal is a cicada. The cicadas are always chirping, to the point that they are background noise for a large portion of the story. In Umineko, however, You never hear Seagulls except for the title screen. How this is significant, I have no clue; maybe it's explained later. It's interesting to think about.

Anyways, this arc was pretty hectic, almost to the point of throwing everything I thought I knew about the story out of the window. I think [this](http://imgur.com/klPWlO9) was the exact point where I realized how little I actually knew about the story.  The end part (with the witches banquet) also threw me for a loop. Everyone who survived got mauled by hungry witches or bull-people, and absolutely no mention of any golden land. 

I also got to meet LambdaDelta at the ??? portion of this arc. I feel like the association between her and Takano Miyo was a severe curveball. Maybe, just maybe, they will still have some sort of relation. I have some theories on that, but they have pretty much zero evidence and I'd sound like a crackpot if I put them into words.

Current theories are as follows:

* Shannon and Kanon are homunculi. They can't possibly be human, otherwise how can they make laser swords and forcefields? This would fit in with Beatrice calling herself an alchemist instead of a witch while in human form, as well as Kinzo's obsession with dark magic. It would also explain why they are allowed to wear the one-winged eagle, **they were created using kinzo's blood as a base**. The orphanage is actually breeding ground for homunculi, which would fit considering none of the orphans would have parents. Finally, it would explain why they call themselves furniture: They are not actually human, but created to serve a purpose. By this logic, Genji would also be a homunculus. Gohda and Kumawasa are human (though why they were hired is a mystery to me)

* Witches powers are dependent on the belief of others. This would be one of the reasons why Beatrice desperately wants people to believe despite the fact that she obviously has some sort of magic power. It would also explain why the more sacrifices occur, the more elaborate and impossible they become (Battler could figure out how a human did the first twilight, but not the others). As more twilights occur, more people start to believe in the witch

* The seven icepick's names are references to [Peter Binsfeld's classification of demons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_demons#Binsfeld.27s_classification_of_demons) with the person being stabbed by the icepick of satan (Kanon) having the sin of wrath etc etc. Does that mean being without sin make you immune to the sacrifice? In that case, since Battler and Maria always survive, are they somehow impervious to being killed due to their innocent nature? That would be my guess.

Hopefully this is interesting),OilySalmon,6,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1g0x18/little_busters_route_analysis_kudryavka_noumi/,"A couple days ago, I decided I wanted to give Little Busters another whirl. It's a fantastic game, and it's got a really fascinating plot which I think is even deeper than it seems when you first play it through. I noticed some new stuff after I played Kud's route for the second time, but only thought to write anything down right at the end. Hopefully what I bring up here will be at least mildly interesting, something that at least some people on here didn't notice in their first playthrough. Or maybe I'm just just being a mix of stupid and arrogant, and everyone noticed these things immediately.

Without further ado, here are my notes on Kud's route. Be warned, they're sloppy. I hadn't intended to post them anywhere, but I figured that at least one other person would find some of this interesting.

&gt;Kud mentions getting a letter from her mother inviting her to return to Tevua before the bus accident. She refused. The ""Important thing"" that she mentions when she's bound up in the cave would supposedly ""destroy the world"" or something along those lines (I don't recall exactly what she said- just that she mentions the world and says おしまい.)

&gt;Her regret over not going to see her parents, mostly her mother, before the bus accident, her fear of never being able to see them again and her wanting to atone for that manifests into her route; she's not in conscious control of what happens.

&gt;Kyousuke acts pretty suspicious in a few places along this route too, especially when he, Masato and (I think) Kengo all show up to help pack up some of her things, a few days before she leaves. When Masato asks him if something could be done about it, Kyousuke says something along the lines of this being 'the way it has to be'. My guess is that Masato wasn't asking Kyousuke to stop Kud from going. My feeling is that he, Kengo and obviously Kyousuke knows what's going on with Kud, her parents, and everything else. Knowing what we know about how this dream world ends, Masato and Kengo know what this world is from the very beginning. I think Kud realizes what's happened to all of them too, at least she does when she's half-delirious in the cave. She knows about the bus accident, and that the world they're in is a fiction.

&gt;One thing doesn't make sense to me though- Ricky finds the dog tag with the gear melted onto it in that box soon after Kud is captured by the rioters, right? When she's in the cave, though, she says ""I was stupid. I made a mistake at a critical moment. 'That thing' (the dog tags) is a piece of the crashed rocket I got afterwards.""

 My knowledge of the plot wouldn't be really harmed even if I would skip the first one, since I have read the Alternative manga a good deal (the 18 scanlated chapters) so I know most (or atleast I think I do) major plotpoints from Muv-Luv.

I also read the ML manga a bit, the chapters that were scanlated. No time travelling or whatever was the thing the series is based on had time to happen.

In response to my question about distribution, this was the answer:

The boxed version will only be distributed through Playasia and will only be available in stores in America. We are also planning to distribute the game through Amazon. If you would like to purchase the Online version of the game, it can be purchased through Playasia, Amazon, and a few other gaming sites, which will be announced once the release rate approaches.

While that seems to contradict some things I've seen online, I'll take it as canon for now.

Also, Mangagamer is going to have and hand in distribution assistance, and more or less confirmed the release date shift rumors that had been going around, placing the current date at **June 28th**

**Edit**: forgot this https://twitter.com/MangaGamer/status/333828198733320193

**Super Edit**: So I mentioned that I could probably do a corrective content patch, but there are several roadblocks to that:

The first is repacking. I have a block of code (not mine) for extracting, but I would need someone who knows C++ better than me to reverse it to repack the archives.

Some of the Menus would have to be reworked, and not all labels would be translated, so if people wanted that there would have to be a graphics artist.

Translation I can do, but I would need a copy of the game as well. I have another game translation I have planned for the summer right now, so it would get put off to at least after that (expect it late summer/fall).

The last major risk is that of legal action on the part of MoeNovel or the ESRB. It would be an unauthorised modification to a retail game that adds content that would knock up the rating from a T to AO. I'm not sure how willing I am to take that risk.

Regardless, I'll keep it open as a possibility.",,False,self,t5_2r5yf,1368563231.0,,,True,t3_1e8cfl,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1e8cfl/more_info_on_the_upcoming_release_of_if_my_heart/,

1366518405.0,6,self.visualnovels,1cs8ij,I finally saw Steins;Gate choice! But now I have lots of questions. [Spoiler],Keksus_,6,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/visualnovels/comments/1cs8ij/i_finally_saw_steinsgate_choice_but_now_i_have/,"After watching the anime 2 years ago I finally got around completing the VN. And with completing I mean completing. Played it for maybe 50 hours and watched every single ending. The [true end](http://i.imgur.com/gO1E1OZ.jpg) made me tear up.

But some questions popped up in my head, even though the VN explains more things than the anime. So you can understand my questions better I will start with explaining what I understood so far.

First of all the time travel theory the game uses. If I put everything together correctly than there always exists only one world line and all other world lines are only figuratively. They only are possibilities what could be if this and that happened but don't exist parallel.

And then Reading Steiner is an ability everybody has, but with varying degree, correct? So some people like Okabe notice a change in the divergence directly while others only remember when hearing some kind keyword. Also the world line only changes when a change in the past has an effect. So all the spam mails they sent during their experiments didn't activate Reading Steiner because the Divergence didn't change at all.

There may also be people who can't notice at all. This isn't mentioned in the VN, but it seems logical. Maybe they are as rare as people like Okabe who notice the change directly.

Then after every change made due to time travel the world is completely rebuild.

What I don't understand is why a D-Mail has such a great effect on the divergence but a time leap or even physical time travel has barely any effect. I mean the principle is the same, isn't it? You just send data. And the amount of data you send during a time leap is even greater than the one you can send with a D-Mail. Why is that? To use an example: Why is it possible for Okabe to change when Suzu departs to 1975 with a D-Mail but not with a time leap? Of course you couldn't have jumped so far back with the time leap machine, but that aside Suzus departure is a great influence on the divergence. A divergence so great that it couldn't be accomplished with a time leap, according to the theory stated in the game. But theoretically he could've time leaped and known that he mustn't stop Suzu. Wouldn't this lead to the same result as sending the D-Mail?

Next is Makise death. How could he prevent that? Of course the plan was to deceive his first self to deceive the world. And it was said he can deceive his first self because he only saw lying Kurisu in a puddle of blood but didn't observed if she was alive or not. But at the first time he time travelled there he did observe her death. So how was he able to change this?

The next thing has also to do with the time travel during the true end. Everything that happened there is part of the S;G world line. Meaning the arrival of Suzu as well as Okabes time travelling to save Kurisu. Yet the Steins;gate worldline is a world line with an unwritten future. Suzuha vanishes because there is no future she can return to. After all that future is still being written. But that also means there is no way that Suzu could have come with a time machine and travelled back with Okabe to save Kurisu. This is a paradox. Suzu has to time travel to make Steins;gate possible.

Also the ""second"" Okabe can't possibly accomplish anything there. They tried to explain this with future Okabe saying he has to fail once so he has the ambition to create a new time machine. But why would he do that than he succeeded the second time? It's not a matter of how often he tried, the only thing interesting here is the result. Does he succeed or does he not. When he succeeds he has no intention to develop a time machine. This is another paradox. Okabe HAS TO develop a time machine and send Suzu back to the past.

To be precise he has to deceive the ""second"" Okabe in the Steins;Gate timeline. I actually thought at first that this is exactly what he was doing. He sends Suzu back and tells her what she has to tell the second Okabe. So WW3 and so on were just a lie. But that would mean that Suzu can return to the future. But she vanished without a trace because, as I said before, the future isn't written in the S;G world line. It seems like the story is contradicting itself there.

Another point is the movie D-Mail. Why could he suddenly watch it?

And did I understand it correctly that Moeka and Mr. Braun are still working for the Rounders who are still trying to find all the IBM5100s for SERN?

Another thing isn't related to the story but to how I can unlock stuff: I have every CG unlocked except for the last one on page 7. How can I get that? After all I saw all 6 endings and I think I should've seen everything the game has to offer.

This is all I can think of for now. I hope you can explain some things to me.

First of all, excuse my english, I'm not a native speaker.

I'm still waiting for [TakaJun](http://yandere.tindabox.net/) 's translation of Miyako's path. It kinda sucks, because its the first route I intended to play. (didn't know that it wasn't complete) :c Well, since I can't speak Japanese there's no help to it.

So to my other question: What do you guys think of the ""route-deciding-system"" or however you wan't to call it. Majikoi has this [""Orb-system""](http://imgur.com/NwDnSC1). You can (almost) directly decide with path  you want to read. To be honest, I prefere it over the standart system. You don't have to worry about every decision.
