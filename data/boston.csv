As you all may know, tragedies effect a community in a number of ways.  One of those ways is economically.

Please join me in supporting my fellow restaurant workers down on Boylston Street as soon as the area clears.  Eat, drink, and be happy in their restaurants and bars.  Perhaps most importantly, tip well.  People will be afraid to go back to the area and bartenders and waitresses will lose their jobs without their help.

Thank you all and God bless.

Without a doubt, losing a limb is difficult for anyone but I imagine it must be absolutely devastating for those who are passionate enough about running to participate in/complete the Boston Marathon to lose a leg since legs are essential to running. 

Since it was my leg that was amputated and not my arm, I'm afraid I can't offer as much advice to those who have lost arms because I can only speak from experience **but I really encourage other amputees to reach out and talk to people** to let them know that it will take some time, strength and work but it will get better soon. The technology and medical expertise we have today in combination with the power of human adaptation can yield extraordinary results.

So if you know someone who could use someone to talk to, PM me with contact info and I'll do whatever I can to help. I hope others will join me as well.

Her name is Stella and she is a long-hair brown tabby with a white chest, stomach, and paws and green eyes. She is super friendly and normally comes when called or when you shake a bag of treats. One of my roommates must have let her out on accident without noticing either last night (Thursday) or this morning. We've been searching all day and haven't found her. I'm very worried about her because of the snow.

Please, if you might know where she is message me directly. I just want my cat back :(

Also, she is microchipped and I have been in contact with the MSPCA and shelters. Hopefully I'll find her soon.

Edit: She went missing in Mission Hill, at the intersection of Parker Hill and Hillside.

Edit: YOU GUYS WE HAVE HER BACK! One of our neighbors had apparently taken her in this morning and we just managed to find them. Thank you all so much, especially to all who looked for her!

The management response was salaried staff was free to leave and make up later in the week, however hourly was told they would need to take an occurrence. However build up too many occurrence and you risk termination. With the manhunt on in Boston, today the same has occurred, those employee's in the lock-down area or who cannot access transit were told to take an occurrence, carpool, or find some way in. 

Circles has decided that corporate profits and credit card client demands seem to have a greater directive then safety of their employee, adherence to state ordered directives. 

I am one of those who cannot commute in today but being salaried I'm in no jeopardy of termination, however people I work alongside are not in the same position. If I call it out like I should; I'll just be fired to shut me up and remove me from influencing others. 

I'm in a real shit position with my personal karma right now.

This thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9g1gg3 is on the top of /all as a thread in /bestof, and I wanted to show why it is all a big lie.

First, I want to say that I am a bilingual Korean-American, and am familiar with bad English. I will try and show why yoonalee's posts are a contrived caricature of Korean stereotypes, but there are just so many that I will try to limit it to the most glaring ones. 

1. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gc3sr The guy originally writes ""Please sensor the names,"" but yoonalee apparently knows he means ""censor,"" and proceeds to correct him. ""Censor"" is not a common word in either the vernacular or as a vocabulary word, and it is highly doubtful that a poor English speaker would be able to recognize the spelling error. A non-native speaker is also NOT confident enough to assume that a native speaker made a mistake and carry on with confidence.

2. There are numerous times where she writes extremely American and almost slang-type of phrases. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gcxs9 This shows her saying ""wiring money"" and ""financial assistance."" There are just much, much simpler ways of saying that in a safer manner, the manner that a real non-native speaker would take. 

3. There are many English mistakes that are inconsistent and downright silly. Plural and singular nouns are one of the easiest things you can learn in English, but she constantly messes it up. lazercat1 goes into more detail about the linguistic mistakes here: http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gelxg

4. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gden7?context=3 She writes a near-perfect sentence, then when someone comments on it, promptly devolves into gibberish, saying ""prepare me well for English exam back in Seoul."" Then a comment about how she wants to get a 100, to play up the Korean stereotype. 

5. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9gbjae ""Front Page is big honor""? Why not just say ""Front Page bring great honor to my family!"" I immigrated from Korea. No one actually talks about ""honor."" This is just an Asian stereotype that OP knows that non-Koreans will eat up. I'm genuinely surprised she didn't make a Starcraft reference. 

6. http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cfp6a/thank_you_citizen_of_boston/c9g57xb Someone types in all Korean, and she says she cannot read Korean on her computer. The guy proceeds to take a screencap, and asks if she's OK with her finances. She proceeds to say that her hosts are kind, and that her friend is OK as well. The screencap merely said that he is glad she found a good host, and told her to ask Reddit for financial help if she needed it. She answers in a vague, off-topic way, and it is clear she does not know Korean.

There are many more, like when she asks if a cat gif is the poster's cat(there are gifs and videos of things in Korea. No one is dumb enough to think people only upload things of themselves!!!), the general playing up to a caricature of a Korean, and most importantly, the general feel. Both the boston and bestof thread are full of people whose intuition just tells them it's fake, and I agree. I have left out many things for the sake of (relative) brevity, so feel free to ask about things you are still not sure of.

There were people in need of help, and people who stepped in to help. Period. Rich, poor, black, white, gay, straight, if you live in Boston, this affected you.

So, it hurts me to see other Bostonians turning to racism and hate in the wake of the bombings. Last night in Malden, my hometown, some jackass beat up a Palestinian woman walking on the sidewalk. This makes me angry. I think Bostonians are better than this.

I don't care what ethnicity the bombers were. A douchebag is a douchebag.

Let's not give in to hate, OK?

The whole world is giving us its sympathy right now. If we want that good will to continue in the future, we should show the rest of the world our character and class, and not ruin it by being racist assholes.",,False,self,t5_2qh3r,1366375527.0,,flair-Malden,True,t3_1co9qi,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1co9qi/disturbed_by_some_of_the_racist_sentiments_im/,

Here's the repost:

""I've got about 70000 (actually over 80k) points with Southwest. If you know of any runners/families that need to get home quick/quicker than originally planned, I'm willing to do what I can. I'm not sure if this is the right thread for this, please direct me to where I can offer this assistance if not.  For that matter, anyone who needs to get TO Boston, as well.""

Travel in the area is going to be difficult right now, so I'm not fully sure what to expect.  For reference, a cheap roundtrip is about 12k points.  Right now it looks like a one-way out of Boston, tomorrow, would be almost 30k.

I also have enough for a night or two at a Marriott-chain hotel.

EDIT: And a $100 voucher I forgot about from a stupid 6 hour delay in San Diego.

EDIT EDIT: Someone gifted me Reddit Gold from the main thread, so thanks for that!

EDIT EDIT EDIT: /u/robertsonwx offered their miles as well.

The only things I have to offer are two stupid, friendly dogs who make *me* feel better when the shit hits the fan.  So my plan is to head to Boston Common with my pugs and offer free dog cuddles to anyone who might want them.  I'll be there from noon until 2ish tomorrow (Wednesday 4/17) on the grass near the Park Street station entrance.  If you see a nerdy lady and two black pugs with derp faces, that's us.  So come by and say hi, pet a dog or two, and try not to feel like shit for a few minutes.

(Also, this is my first post on reddit, so I hope I'm not violating some code of conduct or otherwise embarrassing myself.  Come say hi tomorrow!)

There is a regular who comes into work everyday, buys coffee sits by the window and reads his book. He always checks in on us to see how we're doing and how are lives are going. I've had many conversations with him ranging from politics to just life. 

Last week he came in and notice that I was really tired. I explained to him that I haven't been sleeping well sense the weather changed and the heat kicked on in my apartment. He told me to get myself a humidifier. I told him I would have to save up for it, but that I would look into it. 

Yesterday he comes to work, just to see if I will be there today. 

Today he shows up with a new humidifier and tells me to get some sleep and that he was worried about my health. Thank you for the humidifier Mr. Regular. He has made my year and restored some of my faith in humanity.

If this were Chicago, or Philadelphia, or Atlanta, or pretty much any other big city in the US, then Cambridge and Somerville and Brookline and Watertown and a few others would all be under the same city government.

Until very recently, I considered /r/boston to be about the metro area as a whole, but recently I've seen the moderators and others making comments suggesting ""you've got your own reddit, go there"" to people in Somerville, Cambridge, and other nearby towns.  IMO, shoving relevant content (or people) away from /r/boston would make this place less useful and less fun.

Having separate reddits for some of these cities - and even for neighborhoods within Boston proper - is not necessarily a bad thing, for posts that are very specific to those places.  However, it does have a cost.  Having one general gathering place for everyone in Boston, where we can see what's happening all around the city, is a good thing.  Pushing that content out of the main reddit means pushing it away from people who'd be interested, but don't know to look at each one of the smaller reddits.  It would fragment the community when there doesn't seem to be an overriding reason to do so.

Since some of these comments are coming from moderators, I'm worried that we have a new moderation team that's hostile to any neighborhoods not part of Boston proper, and is pushing this fragmentation.  It's a stealth change of the purpose of a subreddit into something other than what it has been, without the users asking for such a change.  Can we please expand the moderation team to include advocates of a greater /r/boston, that includes the whole city?

----------

EDIT: Clarification of what I propose ...

Never use either of these:

* The fact that a particular location is inside or outside the municipal boundary of Boston proper

* Whether or not there exists another subreddit for that place

... as a reason to or justification for:

* Whether something is relevant to /r/boston

* Whether something belongs in this subreddit

* Any decision about how this subreddit is managed or moderated

In other words, whatever opinions or decisions you state or make about the scope or management of /r/boston should be justifiable *without* resort to the specific borders Boston proper, or the existence of other subreddits.

Of course nobody can force anyone to act that way.  It's just my proposal.  But if the moderators follow that proposal, and most participants do as well, we'll avoid fragmentation.",,False,self,t5_2qh3r,1369266977.0,,,True,t3_1eu1ai,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1eu1ai/pushing_for_the_fragmentation_of_rboston/,

So, since the last time we did this, a FUCK TON has gone on.

How do you get them? Same way as always. 5 cookies. 5 dollars. Free delivery. Just text 424-241-2825! (Although, some of our new flavors are a little more pricey and are $5 for 4 cookies, but they are bigger and also SUPER AWESOME.)

Details inside!,yiseowl,370,43,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1iyvmd/my_friend_and_i_have_finished_the_boston_events/,"[TheBostonCalendar.com](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/)

Hey everyone, my friend (Saurav) and me (Sean) launched a Boston event website today geared towards Boston redditors. We're hoping it will serve as a helpful resource for people around here to find (and perhaps post) interesting, fun, under-publicized, mostly-free events happening around the city and surrounding areas (e.g. Cambridge, Somerville, Brookline).

The brief background of the site is four months ago I read [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/19bz00/would_it_be_possible_to_make_a_boston_google/?sort=top) where a user ([xerxesxerxes](http://www.reddit.com/user/xerxesxerxes)) inquired about putting together a list of events happening around the city. I thought that made sense, because while there are plenty of Boston event calendars already out there, none are specifically geared towards the cost-conscious reddit user/young professional/student simply looking for something cool to do around the city.

A lot of the events currently on the site are ones that I added myself -- mostly things I think redditors might be interested in (e.g beer tastings, free dance lessons, panels at universities, free yoga sessions, board game meet-ups). I'm also planning to keep up with any and all events that get featured in the Boston event subreddit ([r/BostonSocialClub](http://www.reddit.com/r/BostonSocialClub)). For example, try clicking '[Next three months' and filtering by 'r/BostonSocialClub](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events?day=24&amp;year=2013&amp;month=7&amp;three_months=1&amp;tags[]=r%2FBostonSocialClub)'. By doing that you'll probably find the [r/Boston: Beach Day \(Revere Beach\)](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/r-boston-beach-day-revere-beach) event (something I'm looking forward to going to myself).

So, please do check out the site, and feel free to provide feedback in the comments as we know there's a lot to be improved on. Finally, here are a few of my personal picks currently on the site:

* [Drawing in the Galleries at the MFA](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/drawing-in-the-galleries-at-the-mfa--2) (draw in an MFA gallery - for free - supplies included!)

* [Beer tasting at The Old State House](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/beer-tasting-at-the-old-state-house) (10 bucks. Learn what kind of drinking games Sam Adams used to play - in the Old State House!)

* [Stair Workout at Harvard Stadium](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/stair-workout-at-harvard-stadium-the-november-project--2) (The November Project) (""grassroots workout tribe."" $0 forever!)

* [Open Mic Night \(for comics\)](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/open-mic-night-for-comics--3) (Union Sq, free)

* [Public Open Night @ the BU Astronomical Observatory](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/public-open-night-the-bu-astronomical-observatory--3) (free star gazing -- multi-million dollar telescopes)

* [Office Hours with George Mabry](http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/office-hours-with-george-mabry) (talk with a Venture Capitalist on-on one -- for free!)

The more reputable news organizations aren't saying his name, but the sloppier right-wing ones aren't being so circumspect (I'm looking at you, FOX news!) which means that I bet there's a lot of nasty hate about to head his way.

I guess there's a chance he's actually involved and I'll feel stupid about this post, but if not, can you _imagine_? You're a student, just a regular kid. You're far from home, so you've got no family to support you, and you witness this awful, terrifying thing. You're badly injured, and the police show up at the hospital and start interrogating you (and even if they are being basically respectful of your rights, can you imagined how intense that must be?), they search your house, question your roommate, take a bunch of your stuff...and then your name gets out and is spread all over the internet, so that all of your social media is flooded with hate and psychosis. In a way, the one thing that makes this okay is that the whole city has rallied together to support the victims...except for this one guy. Think about how lonely that must be.

Especially if we get to a point where the police have definitively cleared him, I think it'd be nice if there was some way to show our support. Does anyone have any thoughts? If you want a little bit more information on this, I found out most of my info from Google after reading [this Snopes post on Marathon-related rumors](http://snopes.com/politics/conspiracy/boston.asp) which is definitely worth a read in its own right.

Also: cats.,saucisse,359,42,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1ess1c/pedestrian_justice_in_somerville_also_cats/,"So I'm crossing Washington St. in Somerville, just outside of Union Square towards Sullivan.  Its a sort-of-four-lane road, for people who like to get creative with their driving.  I've lived here for a decade and have been almost-hit at least a dozen times when someone stops to let me cross and people pass them on the right.  

Tonight, I'm in the crosswalk and a car stops for me.  I walk out, give the guy a little wave (because I'm polite like that) and wouldn't you know some guy in a sedan some whizzing down the road and passes the stopped car on the right, apparently not cluing into the fact that crosswalk + stopped car = pedestrian in the road.  I see him coming and kind of step back to keep from getting run over.  After he goes by, I start to step away from the car who has stopped for me, and at just as I take a step the car who stopped *puts on his blue flashers*, drives around me, and pulls the guy over! Yes MA'AM, the car was an unmarked police car!  Oh, sweet sweet instant justice!  I literally doubled over laughing as I walked away.  There are so many bad drivers going through my neighborhood (as I said above, I've nearly been hit as a pedestrian multiple times and was very close to getting t-boned by an oil truck that ran a hard red light that everyone runs with no cops in sight to stop them.)  This was just the most glorious moment, and I needed to share.

Also, because it's my ""cakeday"" as the kids call it, apparently I'm supposed to show you pictures of my cats.  Here they are, in my living room:

Do you like cookies? Do you like being able to get cookies late at night? How about delivered to you? **ON A BICYCLE**.

[Sweet Idea](http://www.haveasweetidea.com) is a new cookie delivery business coming to Somerville, primarily operating around the Tufts University campus. I'm gonna be biking around with bags full of cookies from 9PM-3AM Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. I also wear an orange jumpsuit, really easy to spot and flag down for superfast deliciousness. [The full uniform, in action.](http://imgur.com/PrUJc)

Initially there are only going to be two flavors, chocolate chip and snickerdoodle. I will be adding more variety soon! How much? It's $5 for 6 cookies. Trust me, they are decadent. That $5 includes tax and delivery is **FREE**. For only $5 dollars I will bust my ass and bike to you, even in the snow, rain, rapidly approaching apocolaypse, whatever. If we get a hurricane this year, maybe I can fly around instead. (The cookies are just a little airborne, they're still good, they're still good!)

Basically, I love baking cookies and making drunk and high kids happy. Those are two big goals of mine. (Good goals, lofty goals.) If you want to eat some bomb-ass cookies (not bomb ass-cookies) late at night, text Sweet Idea at 424-241-2825. (No time to answer the phone, got cookies to deliver!) You can also order online at [www.haveasweetidea.com/order](http://www.haveasweetidea.com/order). Cash is preferred (credit card fees suck) but I can also accept credit cards at the door using [Square](http://www.squareup.com).

FIRE AWAY

e: Hey everyone, wanted to say thanks for the huge turnout! Way bigger than I expected. I will keep answering whatever questions roll in during the next few hours and then turning in. By the way, I'm planning on being open during the Super Bowl. What kind of cookie would Gronk eat?

Assuming this is true, do you think it'd be possible to get some sort of recognition in the form of a plaque or ""historical marker"" or something? I see a lot of plaques all over Medford Square marking some important event in history (creation of Jingle Bells, one of Paul Revere's stops, the rum distilleries, etc), and I think it'd be fun to see a marker signifying that Medford was the birthplace of Reddit.

And yes, I understand that Reddit isn't really on par with historical events like the ride of Paul Revere. And no, I don't expect the city or its loyal taxpayers to pay for it...this would be a ""hey, anyone want to chip in $5 for an official Reddit plaque in Medford?"" sort of thing. 

What do you think?

I just got physically intimidated and verbally harassed by an agent from ABA who was showing my place to prospective renters. I'm not looking for advice, in fact, I got some useful reminders courtesy of the Medford Police.

For those of you who are getting run ragged by strangers wandering through your home, the officer assured me that you can refuse entry to ANYONE at ANY TIME without 24 hours notice, and the only person who you need to let in with notice (provided doing so would not make you feel threatened) is the Landlord. This is all part of the ""quiet enjoyment"" clause in the MA tenant rights laws. 

I was hoping to file a restraining order, but the officer said that they need three reports before they can file a harassment order. If informed that they cannot come and they do, or if you feel threatened by them when they come, call the non-emergency line of your PD and make a report. Three of those = restraining order, and the fourth = handcuffs.

If they open the door without prior permission, even if they have keys or the door is unlocked, that's breaking and entering and you should call the police.

TL;DR realtors don't actually have the right to show the apartment while you're living in it (it is at your discretion and comfort), and it is totally illegal to come in without getting your consent.

Now, I'm going to go breathe into a paper bag a few thousand times. Share your horror stories if you've got them!

EDIT: wow guys, it's...great? to know that AllBoston isn't the only douchnozzle agency. Since there's been some misinformation in this thread, I'd like to reiterate that tenants are NOT obligated to comply with showings, and only the Landlord has any right to access the premises while you live in it. My lease says otherwise and yours probably does to; that doesn't matter. If your landlord isn't a jerk (mine isn't) then by all means, let them show the apartment, but I'm talking about an agency that was hired to show the place, a ragtag band of thugs who have keys to my living space, threatened me in my own home, and I'm extremely glad that I don't have to let them in.",,False,self,t5_2qh3r,1374234774.0,,flair-Medford,True,t3_1ilfq1,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1ilfq1/all_boston_apartments_harassmentyou_has_the_power/,

Here's the news report, which just posted hours ago: http://www.myfoxboston.com/story/19751064/2012/10/05/search-for-missing-grad-student-in-boston

He's 23, and the brother of one of my best friends.
He's been living in Boston in the Allston neighborhood with one roommate, who was home when he left at 8:30pm on Tuesday night.

It's thought that he only has his phone, debit card and a small amount of cash. His glasses, phone charger, Drivers Licence, Passport, computer were all left at his apartment.

His phone is off and no activity has been made on his debit card since tuesday afternoon. His car has been accounted for.

He has no Tuesday or Weeknight routine aside from occasional coffee shops on his work breaks
Given the circumstances (no behavioral history, no record of drug use, depression, etc) the disappearance is super Mysterious. So far no explanations have been proposed.

There's the likelihood of abduction I suppose, but from what I can tell even in his neighborhood, a kidnapping/disappearance of sorts would be a very freak occurrence. ...perhaps a Boston native would know better.

He's got an adventurous spirit, but not much further beyond riding his motorcycle which he did not have up in Boston. Basically he wouldn't have wound up in a scenario prone to a becoming mixed up in a kidnapping, or flat out disappearance. Essentially a straight laced guy who is dearly close to his family and friends.

Please share with anyone living in Boston. And any Boston reddditors with any thoughts/advice please share. I'll post updates from his parents as I receive them.

**Update 3**, 2/28  
For those still following the story, thank you - our main concern is keeping the press on this until we can find some answers. Nothing turned up after two days of searching the reservoir, as far as the police tell us, pretty thoroughly. The most unsettling part of all of this is the complete lack of information - there are people all over the place, he wasn't out incredibly late, and there are cameras around the area he went missing - but nothing has turned up. We have been speaking to specialists to bring in more help for the search, but we're pretty confident we're not going to find a body anywhere near Chestnut Hill. Will still keep you all posted.  
  
One way or another, my friends and I are coming out of this ordeal a lot different than we went in - for better or worse. Thanks again to all those praying and wishing well, and please continue to keep your eyes and ears open.  


**Update 2**  

* Fox25 news just aired a 2 minute spot about him  
* We're having a publicity rally in cleveland circle tomorrow, [join us here](http://www.facebook.com/events/262255087182818/)  
* Please tweet with #FindFranco, or copy and past this to whoever you can: Missing Boston College student! Please help spread the news! http://www.facebook.com/groups/224465344316495/ #FindFranco  
      
Thank you all for your continued support.  
  
**Update:**  
To keep the news going, we're holding an info rally tomorrow from 9am to 4pm in Cleveland Circle. We would be happy to talk about anything in person there.  
  
We are working with the Boston College Police department and the Newton Police department currently. We are hoping for the Brighton and Boston police to get more involved (especially since Franco was last seen in Brighton). If anyone has connections to Boston, Brighton, or State police, we could really use them putting attention into this!  
  
**People around Waltham:**  
Franco works at a CVS in Waltham. If anyone has seen him there, or has ever noticed suspicious activity there (before or after last Tuesday), we need your help!

1366254593.0,230,self.boston,1ckz2g,Open Letter to Janet Wu of NBC News Regarding Krystle Campbell - victim of Boston Marathon Bombing,prettyautumnleaves,266,36,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1ckz2g/open_letter_to_janet_wu_of_nbc_news_regarding/,"Good Evening,

It’s nice to (informally) meet you. My name is Autumn. It’s unfortunate we have to meet under these circumstances. I’m hoping this letter will change that.


I’m 24 years old, and I'm proud to say I've spent my entire life as a Massachusetts resident. My family was born and raised here. I’d consider myself blessed. While times may be hard, the people of Massachusetts have a way of holding everyone together. We are a community. We are strong, resilient, and diligent. God, I love that dirty water.


Like most, I am deeply troubled by the unfortunate events that occurred at the Boston Marathon on Monday. However, I've rejoiced in the humility and acts of kindness shown by complete strangers to one another. It takes someone completely estranged from sanity to commit such acts of evil. Watching the recent news coverage has been mentally and emotionally taxing. There isn’t a word I can conjure synonymous to how it feels watching a shaken community come together in times like these. It has reminded many how quickly things can change, how important it is to say a simple “I love you,” and how unequivocal it is that your Dunkin order came with two packets of Equal instead of three (give it another 2 blocks or so, you’ll stumble across another drive thru). 


While watching NBC’s 10 o’clock NightTeam News on Channel 7, I listened in as Janet Wu (an NBC news anchor) began her story on Krystle Campbell – a vivacious young woman who was one of the 3 lives claimed by the bombings on Monday. I noticed quickly that Janet was not in NBC’s newsroom, but rather standing in front of the Campbell family home. It was 10 o’clock at night. Somehow this didn’t sit well with me – is she really reporting from the Campbell’s driveway at 10 o’clock at night – as they mourn the loss of their daughter?
Janet Wu featured a press release the Campbell family issued earlier that day from virtually the same spot as she stood now (you can view the press release here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2KP20kCIC0). 


I watched the remainder of Wu’s news story, wondering if maybe a member of the Campbell family was going to appear, or that something new had come up, but instead Wu simply wrapped up her story before a commercial break.


I couldn’t help but feel enraged. Did Janet Wu – or her camera crew, ever consider that giving the family space as they mourn the loss of Krystle, would be far more appropriate than setting the stage on her lawn? Did Janet Wu ever consider that this could have easily been her daughter? Could anyone at NBC have spared just a little common sense and decency, and enlighten Ms. Wu on just how disrespectful and insensitive this decision might’ve been? The story could’ve easily been given from a cozy newsroom and have still had the same effect on viewers – while giving courtesy to the Campbell family.


Assuming the answer was “no,” I decided to take matters into my own hands. I wrote Janet Wu on Facebook, and told her how disappointed I was in her broadcast and that I felt it could’ve been handled differently. Within minutes, I had numerous strangers messaging me, explaining that they were also outraged by the news coverage – and it wasn’t long after that Janet Wu – or whomever is in charge of her Facebook page – deleted my comment. Still bothered, I decided to take it a step further and post to  NBC via Facebook. This was my message:

 
&gt; Hi,

&gt;I would like to leave a comment regarding your News7 Boston Channel and your anchor Janet Wu. I'm a Massachusetts resident and have been personally touched by the devastating events that occurred at the Marathon. I've rejoiced in the humility and acts of kindness shown by complete strangers to one another. It takes someone completely estranged from sanity to commit such acts of evil. However, whom I'm not as humbled by is Janet Wu, who was broadcasting her live report in front of the Campbell family home for the 10 o'clock news. The Campbells had already given a statement earlier that day - the mother in shambles and clearly grieving for her daughter. Janet Wu should be ashamed of herself. When I wrote to Janet Wu on Facebook speaking my opinion, she promptly deleted my post and went along with her day. While I'm not one to judge, I am deeply unnerved by her ruthlessness and insensitivity to the matter at hand. I pray that one day she will be able to put dignity ahead of her salary. 

&gt;NBC, you have very much disappointed me.


Within minutes of posting it, NBC had also deleted my post.
I am entirely outraged. As far as I’m concerned, this is inexcusable. We as a city are helping complete strangers in need during a moment of panic. We are comforting those who have been injured. What is Janet Wu doing? She’s getting her name in every living room and coffee shop in the state – on the front steps of a suffering family.  As a human being – as a woman – as a Massachusetts resident – Janet Wu should be ashamed of herself. 


Please – I urge you to pass my letter along, simply to get the word out. Matters like these should not be ignored. I can’t imagine losing my daughter like this, only to find Janet Wu standing on my front lawn in the middle of the night. This message is too important.


Thank you for your time. Keep Calm and Boston On.

1341426636.0,216,self.boston,w1i9l,Why I quit Subway two years ago tonight. ,streetsim,280,64,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/w1i9l/why_i_quit_subway_two_years_ago_tonight/,"I was working for about half a year at the Beacon Hill Subway sandwich shop when I was put on the schedule for July 4th. Our new owner/managers were from India and it was their first month or so in the country. I tried to take it off, they said no. 

I show up at work around 5pm and quickly realize that I'm the only one on the schedule for the entire night. Anyone not familiar with the area should know that this is the closest Subway to the Esplanade, so I had an uncountable amount of customers. 

I sold out of bread within the first two hours. I called my bosses asking if I could be let out, as we had already run out of bread and there was no more ready to be made. 

They told me to hold on. 

So I closed the door. People banged their fists, hungry. I opened the door and they came in, I told them I had nothing. They yelled at me as if it was my fault. I told them to get out.

An hour later, my bosses came in with a three trash bags filled with bread from various stores around the city. 

Two hours later, there were about three dozen of these left, and the fireworks show had just gotten out. 

Thankfully, one of my co-workers (who might even be on Reddit?) came from the show and helped me out. That was the best thing anyone's ever done for me. 

Drunken idiots came in, requested sandwiches, drank in the store. I told them to get the fuck out, but they just laughed. When I told them to get out again, they threw their sandwiches at me. I dodged them, but picked up the sharpest knife I could and screamed at the top of my lungs that the store was closed. It was a fucking mess. 

I didn't clean up, or put anything away but the stuff that needed to be refrigerated. I left a note saying that I quit. 

The next Monday, I got a call from my boss asking why I was late to work that day. 

I told them that I quit on Independence Day.

As I was trying to board the Green Line B at Boylston, the operator closed the door on me and I had to push it open in order to get in. Keep in mind that I was right behind the person in front of me, so there was no way she (the operator) could not have seen me. Nevertheless, I thought nothing of it and let it go.
Now, along the way towards Boston College, I noticed that this kind of thing was happening at every stop; the operator either failed to open the door until passengers were forced to rush and board the secondary car or she opened and closed the doors before everyone had gotten on. I was getting annoyed but again did nothing.
And then it happened. As the train stopped at Kenmore, an elderly Asian couple tried to get off and right as her husband got off, the doors shut in her face. I was furious along with everyone else on the train. The couple didn't seem to speak English and I wasn't even sure if they could even call each other. Despite people basically screaming to open the back door, the train just moved on. It was fucked up.
I was really ticked off and made my way to the front of the train to speak with the operator. When I got there, I told her that she stranded an elderly woman on the train without her husband and that people (including me) are complaining that she has not been operating the doors correctly. She was completely oblivious to everything that had just happened.
I am writing this because I am angry and really worried for the couple. This should not be happening at all. The only thing I regret is not speaking up earlier. I don't know what kind of trainee orientation the MBTA puts its employees through, but it obviously needs to be revamped. A 19-year-old should not need to tell a grown man or woman how to press a button.

As a Bostonian, I feel that we cannot allow this to happen without push back.  

I've never tried to organize something like this before and have very little details right now (I just read the news of this this morning) but would other Redditors in the area be willing to join in and keep these people at bay if they do show (in the same manner the Patriot Guard does)?

FINAL UPDATE:  A huge thank you to all that came to show your support! There were literally hundreds of you and it was awesome to see people make the effort, I was truly moved.  Also, a huge thanks to the Boston Police, they were amazingly helpful.  The WBC did not make an appearance, which is the best outcome we could have hoped for.  Finally, thank you to the organizers of The Human Wall, you did a fantastic job!  Please, if you have the means to, I urge you to donate to The 1 Fund to help support the victims and families effected by this tragedy.  Take care!

UPDATE 4:  Thank you everyone, it truly makes me proud to see that people care enough to make an effort!  I am calling it a night but hope to see you all there.

From the Human Wall Facebook Site-

* WE ARE MEETING AT FRANKLIN SQUARE on 4/18, a public park 3 blocks away from the church. 

* Please DO NOT GO DIRECTLY TO THE CHURCH: the sidewalks are very narrow, and they will quickly become clogged unless we organize down the street and enter the area in an orderly fashion.

* Please ARRIVE 1 hour early, at 9:00AM to learn where we need you to go. Event coordinators will be present to direct people towards the church. 

* Please TAKE THE T: take the Orange Line to Back Bay Station, the Silver Line SL5 to Washington &amp; E Newton, or take a bus.

* Please AVOID BRINGING BAGS OR BACKPACKS. There will be very little room on the street, and bags may be subject to police search.

* Please WEAR BLACK, as you are able. This is to show solidarity with each other, and to honor the somber nature of this memorial for the dead. 

* Please DO NOT BRING SIGNS or other counter-protest materials. A memorial service is not an appropriate venue to express personal or political views. 

* Please DO NOT INTERACT WITH THE WBC. Do not respond to them, do not even look at them. They thrive on attention: don't give them any. 

* IF PEOPLE BEGIN TO SING, to drown out the WBC, please DO NOT take this as a cue to begin chanting or making other noise. There is a big difference between singing a hymn and yelling in the street. Maintain the peace at all times. 

* Please PRACTICE RADICAL SELF-RELIANCE and bring everything you need: food, water, medication, contact information, whatever you need so that you can be self-sufficient during this action. Plan ahead.

* Please HELP AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER in maintaining the peace. The WBC can be very antagonistic. Help each other remain calm. 

Remember, even if the WBC do not show up, your peaceful presence will do a great deal to comfort the survivors. So, rest up, and we'll see you tomorrow.


UPDATE 3:  The biggest Facebook group that's helping to organize this is asking that we meet in the park at Franklin Square (Washington St at E Brookline St, in the South End) at 9 am tomorrow so we can properly organize before moving to the Church.

I have also read another group is planning at meeting in Peter's Park (Washington St at E Berkley St, in the South End) at the same time.  


UPDATED 2:  If you plan on joining us, please try to arrive around 9 am at the Church (75 Union Park Street) tomorrow (4/18).  As others have noted, security may be tight and we may not even be able to get close, which hopefully means the WBC won't be anywhere close to the memorial either.


UPDATE: The WBC has announce that they will be picketing from 10:15 until 11am on 4/18. We will be there before they arrive and after they leave.  Be sure to arrive a early as it will be busy, word on some facebook pages was to arrive around 9 am.

The memorial will be at Cathedral of the Holy Cross, 75 Union Park Street, Boston and is set to begin at 11 am on 4/18.

Stand in solidarity with the survivors and the families of the victims and show support by creating a human wall to block the view of the WBC. Please consider wearing black to reflect the somber nature of this event.

We strongly oppose any use of violence. Do not intend to make noise or other disruptions at the memorial.  The WBC will be antagonistic and will try to get you to stoop to their level.  DON'T. 

This is not a political demonstration.  Please don't bring signs, pamphlets, or other materials intended to advance a point of view. Remember that our sole purpose in this action is to support and protect the families.

Ate at La Famillia Giorgio based on your recommendations (A++++).  Took the kids to the children’s museum.  Just wanted to thank you all for being an awesome city with really awesome people.

I had a completely different image in my head about Boston being a rough, hard assed east coast town.  When we got to our hotel last Thursday it had been raining most of the afternoon.  We were walking on the sidewalk and some Masshole drove by and splashed us and our luggage.  I thought, here we go already.  Ever since that one incidence, every single time I turned around, there were Bostonians offering to help us out.  If anyone overheard us talking about something, they would jump in and offer directions, restaurant  opinions, thanking me and my Twins Hat for beating the Yankees, you name it.  You didn’t even need to ask for assistance, it was awesome.

It has restored my faith in humanity and when I die, I want to come back as a Bostonian.  Thanks for the great trip.

1366421367.0,170,self.boston,1cpqxg,"MIT police officer, Sean Collier, was truly the best of us. Here's one reason why.",lynnjdsmith,189,19,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cpqxg/mit_police_officer_sean_collier_was_truly_the/,"When my sister told me she was going to the police academy, I didn't worry about her finishing. But, I admit - despite the fact that she's wicked tough, I feared for what she would face on her road to becoming a Boston cop. The proud and historic MBTA police training academy is well known for it's superior training; and, it's brutality and sexism. The year before my sister applied, the FBI were brought in to investigate the rape and assault of several female cadets. In a separate incident, one female cadet was pulled out because her police chief 'feared for her safety.'

The first week, we talked every day when she got out of class. True to her worthy-of-Boston-PD mettle, she didn't reveal a lot when I asked my litany of probing questions. She often sounded exhausted, and she sometimes sounded a little shaken. A month or two in, she was utterly exhausted the few times I got her on the phone. She, along with all the other cadets, was clearly going through a very difficult trial. But, she kept her chin up. She assured me that there were 'some nice guys there...' Here and there, she shared a few anecdotes. She told me a funny story about everyone being forced to do pushups in the ocean surf until someone threw up. She told me of the trip to the Boston morgue, the advanced decamp room stink, and the ribbing of the unfortunate cadets who threw up (she did not). Overall, it sounded like there was a lot of puking involved. Yet, at her silence on some subjects, I drew my own conclusion that the cadets were pushed right to the limit and even treated horribly at times. 

But my sis, she toughed it out. Knowing there were a few cadets who were welcoming, I worried a little less. Near the end of the six months, she looked thin, sick and pale. I made her promise to eat more, and there was nothing more anyone could do. Our whole family was so proud of her the day her class entered Faneuil Hall, gathered upstairs in the historic cradle of liberty, and became police officers.

In the end, my sister proudly spoke of the camaraderie felt towards her MBTA academy class. I accompanied her to the graduation dinner celebration. Several of the men there wouldn't give her the time of day - would barely speak to her, despite all they had been through together. It was a vast minority. Still, I got a small glimpse of what the academy might have been like at times. On top of the difficulty all cadets face, I think the male instructors and cadets had choice - they would be welcome to make it harder for the women and minorities, or not.

Finally, my point. After the academy, I continued to hear the names of the few friends my sister made at the academy. Among them, Sean Collier. In the difficult times my sis won't talk about, Sean impressed my sister with his kindness and made a friend. He probably didn't think much of it. But, that's what makes it great. I barely met him. And, I'll remember him for the rest of my life. Thanks, Sean.",,False,self,t5_2qh3r,1366588635.0,,,True,t3_1cpqxg,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1cpqxg/mit_police_officer_sean_collier_was_truly_the/,

Guy damaged my car, broke the windshield, threatened to pull out a gun and shoot me, the whole nine yards. Chased me in his car to Neponset Avenue. If any one in the city, specifically Dorchester, near the Adams Village/St. Marks area, see's a white [Toyota Highlander or Rav4](http://investigator.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/Toyota-Highlander-2011-white-crossover-image2.jpg), license plate began with a 4, had a 3 in there somewhere, contact the Mass State Police (Not BPD as Morrissey Blvd is State Police jurisdiction).
The guy was a
 
* White male

* 35-45 years old
* 5'8-5'9 possibly taller
* Around 220lbs or so
* Glasses
* Blue eyes
* Had a heavy ""Boston accent.""
* He was wearing a green t-shirt, gray [Red Sox hat](http://lf.hatworld.com/hwl?set=sku%5B20457221%5D,c%5B22%5D,w%5B400%5D,h%5B300%5D&amp;load=url%5Bfile:product%5D).

Bulk of the incident occurred today at approx. 6:40PM, at the intersection of Victory Rd &amp; Neponset Ave in Dorchester. Any info or help would be greatly appreciated. Officer I spoke to was Trooper C. Flaherty at the South Boston State Police Barracks

**EDIT: A lot of people are criticizing my driving, especially on [Uhub.com](http://www.universalhub.com/crime/20130721-guy-water-bottle-fists-fury-gets-all-road-ragey-do.html), almost making it sound like his reaction was justified. Let me clear something up for some of you guys. The incident in question was that I accidentally cut this man off. This guy was NOT just hovering in my blind spot. When I checked my mirrors, this man was a good 50-60 feet behind me. He was driving a good 65mph on Morrissey Blvd (where the speed limit changes between 35-45mph), I was going a good 40. When I flicked on my turn signal, this man sped up in an attempt to fly by me before I could turn. Whether I'm at fault or not, this man followed me, damaged my car, and threatened my life. Believe it or not, while driving, accidents happen. I may not be the most experienced driver, as I have only had my license for two years now, but I will tell you, I checked my mirrors, and turned me head to see if anyone was coming. When I did look, I saw no one in my way. When I turned, there he was. As I said before, regardless of who was to blame for the Morrissey Blvd part, it does not justify his actions on Neposet Ave/Victory Rd.**



**EDIT 2: Also want to explain that during this entire incident, I did not threaten this man. I did not swear at him. I did not insult him. I didn't even give him the finger. I told him, ""Sorry, it was an accident,"" and he responded, ""You know what? I don't think it was!"" And began his tantrum.**",,False,self,t5_2qh3r,1374651217.0,,flair-Dorchester,True,t3_1is646,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1is646/road_rage_incident_could_use_some_help/,

Thanks for the help by the way. I'm just back in Dublin now and can't believe how much the City has changed.

Where has everyone gone? Every street was busy all the time back then and now it's so much calmer and quieter everywhere. It's also so much cleaner. Every building, street, monument and park was so much cleaner this time around. The City looks amazing. 

Southie completely blew my mind, I can't believe it's the same place at all. So upmarket now! I heard it was changing but it's been really drastic. 

All the irish seem to be gone, in the mid nineties you couldn't go anywhere without meeting someone from home or hearing a local accent from home, this time around I saw and heard nobody. You'd think I'd know the answer to my next question seeing as I am one of them but where did we disappear off to? Back home during the Irish boom I guess. 

I lived in Allston and it hasn't changed much at all really, actually one of the only places that seemed not to. All in all I have to say I still love your City. It's a great place with a great attitude and now I'm home I miss it all over again. I suppose it has changed a lot for the better or at least it appears that way to a visitor.

For those who have not been on his train, imagine a sports broadcaster with a likable voice and hilarious inflections when he's emphasizing station names. He's also pretty witty when it comes to letting people know they need to stop shoving onto the train. This morning he said ""phew! Problem solved"" as soon as we moved out of North Station after people battled the doors and everyone laughed on their ride over to Haymarket. While he may not be comedian of the year, he sure does stand out as doing way more than probably is expected of him as an MBTA conductor in the customer service/communications department.

I'm a 32-year-old from St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador - now the most eastern part of Canada.

A few weeks ago I booked a short trip to your city from April 21-23. As it drew closer, I was surprised to find I grew a little bit paranoid. My mind kept exaggerating all the differences between our two countries until I all but convinced myself that, within minutes of arriving in Boston, I'd be forced by TSA to walk naked through the airport while police officers tazed and beat me before shipping me off to Guantanamo.

But as soon as I saw this horrible act of terrorism on the news, my worries just went away. They suddenly seemed so childish and irrelevant. Now I'm proud and excited to come and express my support for you all and your city in this simple way. And I'm sure there are many others like me. We won't stay away.

As an aside, your city helped mine tremendously after we suffered the devastating Great Fire of 1892. You helped my island again following a tsunami in 1929. In both cases you sent ships and trucks weighed down with aid. You have been a wonderful, generous neighbour. 

So thank you - and see you soon! :)",,False,self,t5_2qh3r,False,,,True,t3_1clnz6,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1clnz6/dont_worry_boston_were_still_coming/,

&gt;Authorities are investigating numerous complaints of credit card fraud in Allston, a Boston police spokeswoman said today. 
&gt;
&gt;Officer Neva Coakley said Boston police detectives, the Secret Service, and several major banks are looking into reports by residents of the neighborhood that their credit card information was stolen and used to make fraudulent purchases. 
&gt;
&gt;Complaints by residents in the online forum reddit.com centered around Blanchard’s Liquors, a large shop on Harvard Avenue popular with students. 
&gt;
&gt;While police would not confirm that the investigation was centered on a particular store, Blanchard’s manager John Corey acknowledged that the store had received complaints, and said managers were cooperating with authorities investigating the fraud. 
&gt;
&gt;Corey said the problem may be linked to the company Blanchard’s uses to process credit card purchases.
&gt;
&gt;“There might have been a problem with one of the credit card processors,” Corey said. “We’ve been working with the people that have been complaining, and the different companies and authorities to get to the bottom of it.” 
&gt;
&gt;Corey said that, as of Saturday, “the problem has been resolved.”

The gist of it is this:  If communicating with your landlord is not working, you should call Inspectional Services at **617-635-5300** and schedule a **free inspection**.  Do it within the first week of moving in.
 
We did this last year, and the inspector was very sympathetic to us as tenants.  He made a list of things that the landlord needed to take care of (ceiling caving in, no covers on wall outlets, even the fact that we had no doorbell, though that might have been because he was frustrated when it took us ten minutes to realize he was standing at our door.)  They gave the list to the landlord and told him he was required to fix everything within three weeks.  They also noticed that we needed one more smoke detector and told him he had 48 hours to install one.  I have to say, it was very satisfying to see our apathetic landlord reprimanded by the city.

NOTE: It can sometimes be very difficult to navigate the Board of Health phone system and reach the right person for scheduling this kind of inspection.  Also, this must be done very soon after moving in, and someone has to be there when the inspector arrives.  Be patient and considerate if the inspector doesn't show up when they're supposed to -- they are truly busy people and they are on your side.  It's a free service, and it's an important asset in the fight against sleazy landlords.",,False,self,t5_2qh3r,False,,,True,t3_z8g3p,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/z8g3p/just_moved_in_to_a_new_place_and_its_falling/,

One of the runners had to stop running, apparently because of a leg cramp or something. It must have been pretty bac because he wasn't able to stand on his left leg at all. Now after running 42k I can only imagine how hard it must be to stand on one leg and he couldn't move forward at all, so it was all he could do to try to not fall over but he could hardly keep standing. The spectators couldn't come to his help because of the fences and somehow, the marathon staff didn't react. Some runners ran by until finally one stopped to help keep him standing. Then another one stopped to help.

Now, this was roughly 100 meters before the finish line and we could see the two helper try to convince the hurt guy to walk to the finish but he just wasn't able to do so. So, without thinking for two long, the two runners who had stopped took the hurt guy by his arms and half carried him towards the finish. 

Those runners decided within seconds to abandon their strive for good running times and instead helping a hurt stranger pass the finish line at all. They did this after running 42km and without thinking much. I think that's an outstanding display of kindness and shows how intrinsically good those two people were in their hearts. I stand in awe!

1351434092.0,139,self.boston,127wam,How to Prepare for a Hurricane - Tips from a Louisiana Transplant,firedrops,176,37,138,http://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/127wam/how_to_prepare_for_a_hurricane_tips_from_a/,"This post is mostly for other transplants since preparing for a hurricane is pretty similar to preparing for a blizzard. But a lot of my non-New England friends in Boston seem to have no idea what to do about Sandy, so I thought r/Boston might also appreciate some advice. I grew up in south Louisiana, lived through Andrew and Katrina unharmed, and am quite used to the ""will it hit or won't it?"" dilemma. The best advice is to be prepared for strong winds and a week without power just in case. Below are some tips for how and what to prepare:

1. **Water**: Often during bad storms the main water sources will be compromised and a boil water order issued. But if your tap water is clean there is no reason to go out and buy water to prepare. Instead, get a big box of gallon sized ziplocs (spring for ones with a good seal.) This will kill two birds with one stone and be a hell of a lot cheaper. Fill the ziplocs with water from your tap and put them in your freezer and fridge. Bags of water are easy to squish into even a packed refrigerator and take up less room than bottles. Plus, if your power goes out your refrigerator will stay cold longer with more things in it. And the water bags in your freezer will be handy ice packs, which may be important if the weather turns warm. 

2. **Canned Goods**: Make sure you have enough canned goods for about a week without power. Even if your power is out longer than a week, usually by then the roads are cleared and you can leave for more supplies. Some good options are: peanut butter, chili, tuna fish, canned chicken, and instant sides like rice or potatoes. If you have a gas stove you will probably still be able to use it if the power goes out (you'll just have to light it yourself), so dry goods will work then too.

3. **Lights**: Obviously without power you'll need another kind of light. Flashlights are great, but usually have a narrow beam and take a lot of batteries to run hours on end. They are best for short use. I prefer candles, camping lanterns, or oil lamps for just keeping the room lit. For candles, I like to go to the ""Mexican"" aisle in the grocery store and stock up on the basic white candles in glass (they are with the Saints candles - sometimes called 7 day candles). They are usually about $1 each and are meant to last for days. Oil lamps are also super easy to make. You can find a tutorial [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Glass-Bottle-Oil-Lamp/) though to be honest you can just punch that hole in the top of a glass olive oil bottle. 

4. **Bring it Inside**: A rookie mistake is to forget about the things you have outside. If the storm has high winds your grill, chairs, and plants can all become flying projectiles. If you can't bring them in try to tie them down. And tell your neighbors to do the same. Their outdoor decorations can go through your windows just as easily as they can go through theirs. 

5. **Activities**: When the power goes out and you're stuck in your house or apartment for a week it gets really boring. Like really, really boring. So think about what you can do without power. Get some board games, cards, and stuff like that. Alcohol works too.  

6. **Weather**: Is it going to be cold or hot when the power goes out? How will you deal with that if you don't have power? Most likely for us it will be cold so make sure you have plenty of blankets. I like to keep some hot hands around as well - throw one under your blankets before bed and it will keep you toasty. 

7. **Hurricane Parties**: Hurricane parties are a time honored tradition in Louisiana for a reason. First, if you've gotta be stuck inside why not have fun? But second, it allows you to merge resources and pick a spot that will be safe and good to ride it out. So here is how to prepare and pick a place:

* A good spot is a house or apartment second floor or higher (no basements!) with a gas stove, multiple bathrooms, and space for guests to sleep. 

* Coordinate with guests to get food, water, games, sleeping bags, and alcohol. You all might be stuck there for days so make sure everyone brings enough for the group. Remember that while beer is great, it kind of sucks when warm. Hard liquor and red wine, on the other hand, are much more drinkable when warm. 

* Have someone bring a grill and charcoal so you can cook outside. Make sure you also have some pans and utensils for cooking canned goods on the grill. Be prepared for neighbors to beg some.

* In Louisiana we love to invite musicians because an acoustic jam session is great entertainment when the power is out. Maybe that's why half of New Orleans can play an instrument. 

* Remember that guests at a Hurricane Party are there for friendship, entertainment, pooled resources, and safety. But this sense of community is also important for rebuilding and helping one another afterwards. You'll all get to know one another real quick and these things can form life long friendships if you have a good group. Don't invite assholes, really annoying people, and selfish jerks. You're going to be stuck with them for a long time

**Edit: Forgot to add that if you have a car you should try to park it away from trees. Branches and whole trees can fall if the winds get high.** 

**Edit 2: Have some cash on hand in case power is out for a number of days and you need to go restock on supplies. Also fill up your car with gas if you don't live within walking distance to basic necessities. You can fill up your tub with water so you can use it to flush your toilet if needed. Battery powered radios are useful so you can hear if there are any boil water orders or safety concerns. And, if the eye of the storm is predicted to go over your place remember that there will be a period of calm then.

I think it is a mix between corgi and chihuahua, but I'm certainly no dog expert.

Last night my roommate left the pub for a smoke and a guy walked by and offered him the dog. He said he found it and couldn't take good care of it, so he was trying to find it a good home. The dog stayed at our place last night. He is very friendly and outgoing, and clearly house trained. He will sit, lay, and perhaps other things as well I just don't know the command words.

The dog was given to us with no collar, but as you can see he is well kept so must not have been wandering outside for too long before being given to us. I would really like to get this dog back to his rightful owner if possible. I plan on making signs and posting them throughout the neighborhood where we got the dog. What other steps can I take to make sure I get him back to his owner? It's not likely that I can keep this dog long term, so if the owner is not found what is the best way to find him a good home?

We will have everything from N64s to Dnd, Boardgames, Card Games, Tabletops, Magic the gathering and more!  See the [Facebook Page](http://www.facebook.com/GameOverBar) for more details.  June 26th, 4-10pm 18+ no cover 28 kingston St Boston, Ma 02111.

Game Over started as a ""hey wouldn't that be cool if..."" idea and is finally becoming a reality.  We are striving to create a place for gamers and nerd of all interests and sub groups to come together and enjoy their hobbies and passions in one place.  It is for this purpose Game Over was created and hopefully because of this that it will grow and thrive.

We will have everything from board games to card games, DnD to MtG, n64s and Wiis, and anything else that we can think of or people decide to bring.  We are even working on building an arcade cabinet just for this event and future events.  

Getting into specifics we will be coordinating with the good folks over at /r/bostonboardgames to bring in the cream of the crop of Boston's board game community and hopefully introduce some new people to the awesomeness that is board gaming.

We will be having Magic the Gathering tournaments at the event as well, I haven't decided which type yet (boosted or sealed) but we will be working with [Pandemonium](http://www.pandemoniumbooks.com/) who are being good enough to provide us with two Avacyn Restored booster boxes per event which will be used AT COST (ie if we do a booster draft entry will be 7.50 instead of the usual 15 so you get three booster packs for half of what you would normally pay) so hopefully we see a strong showing from the local MtG community.

Table top games will also be an integral part of the night however it is sadly one of the areas in which I am lacking experience or friends who play.  All tabletops are welcomed, maybe some will consider starting a new campaign to be held at Game Over, if you are interested in getting involved and helping us find some people who love to tabletop then get in touch!

We will also have 3 n64s (to start, we will probably acquire more later) being provided by [Game Underground](http://www.game-underground.com/) hooked up to some of the tvs playing old favorites like mario kart 64, goldeneye, perfect dark, and anything else people bring.  We will also have one wii (again just to start with, these things are surprisingly expensive) with Super Smash Brothers Melee on it or anything else that is brought to the first event.  We are always accepting feedback in this and any other areas, if you think of something we are missing or should add please let me know!  For our soundtrack I have found a long list of favorite video game theme songs and other related tracks, the list can be previewed [here](http://www.youtube.com/user/SupraDarky#p/c/9B23A78D3D249A74) it has over 1,000 tracks so far and will be on shuffle so it will hopefully provide a sufficient ambiance to the night.

We are always accepting suggestions so if you think we are missing something or should add a new game/system/idea please let me know.  I will also try and answer any questions you may have.
