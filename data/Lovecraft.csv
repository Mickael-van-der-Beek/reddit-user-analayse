1339368920.0,249,self.Lovecraft,uv7w0,How 'Prometheus' is basically 'At the Mountains of Madness' (spoilers),donald20,286,37,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/uv7w0/how_prometheus_is_basically_at_the_mountains_of/,"I regularly listen to the H.P. Lovecraft literary podcast, and on their most recent episode, they mentioned how Del Toro said that 'Prometheus' was basically 'At the Mountains of Madness'. Now, after seeing the movie, I do not doubt this in the least. So, for those who are interested, I am going to explain why.

There is actually a major point to make, though: In AtMM, what they found was accidental. In Prometheus, they were intentionally looking for something, but they just ended up opening a giant can of worms.

Alright, first thing is setting. Though Prometheus takes place on an alien planet and AtMM takes place in Antarctica, they both function relatively the same; they are both extremely inhospitable environments (the planet in Prometheus having toxic levels of CO2 and dangerous weather patterns), they are both extremely isolated (The Planet, as it will now be called, is a two-year journey from Earth) and they are both relatively unknown in their construction.

Both teams are composed of mostly scientists, though the Prometheus does have a little bit of military force. However, the lead scientist (and thus lead character) is a female archaeologist, Shaw, while Dire is a male geologist. For the most part, Holloway serves as the Danforth character for a time, but I'll explain that later.

They even have similar equipment: the Prometheus being analogous to the S.S. Arkham and the S.S. Miskatonic, the land transports being similar to the planes, and the small ATVs being dog sleds.

So, both stories basically start with geological discoveries, Prometheus with a map to Planet, while AtMM starts with some strange soapstone markings.

Eventually, an away team is sent to explore. In Prometheus, they begin to investigate the alien (they are called the Engineers) base, while in AtMM they begin to discover some ruins of the Elder Things city.

Soon, they discover specimens: a well preserved Engineer, or several well preserved Elder Things. In Prometehus, they jump the gun a bit before AtMM; they start discovering murals and the language of the Engineers right away, while in AtMM, it takes them a while. The crew of the Prometheus also discovers the 'shoggoth' of this story, the mysterious black goo.

Soon, however, there investigation is cut short, with a silica storm in Prometheus and a blizzard in AtMM. Two people get left behind in the Engineer's base, and they are forced to stay the night with no contact to Prometheus due to electrical interference. The entire away team of AtMM is cut off, though.

As they are cut off, the crew left on the Prometheus poke around with the head of a dead Engineer, and the AtMM crew poke the Elder Things.

Now, things begin to diverge a little. In AtMM, we all know that the Elder Things came and killed the scientists. In Prometheus, however, it was the black goo that killed the two scientists remaining in the base.

The black goo is pretty different from the Shoggoth, although it serves the same purpose. In Prometheus, the android David intentionally poisons Holloway with the goo, which slowly kills him. Later on, the goo and the shoggoth will line up thematically in a more distinct way.

Anyway, the remaining team eventually goes to find the away team. In Prometheus, they discover one of the scientists is dead, another is missing, and Holloway is eventually killed by his own request, thus ending his reign as the Danforth to Shaw's Dire. In AtMM, they discover the corpses of almost the entire away team, though one of them is missing as well.

This is where Prometheus diverges again, with the whole 'pregnant with an alien creature' plot. That was, in my opinion, just an homage to the original Alien, and it didn't really have any connection to AtMM.

However, with Holloway dead, David slowly steps into the role of Danforth. Though David is a bit malicious, he does offer help to Shaw on several occasions.

Soon, David discovers the analogue of the Elder Thing city, the Engineer spaceship. He also discovers a preserved (and alive) Engineer, which could be a better analogue to the frozen Elder Things.

Soon, they discover the remaining scientist, though in Prometheus, the outcome was much more bloody, with the scientist killing about 5 people before he was finally put down.

Another divergence here is that the 'final' team in Prometheus is larger than the AtMM 'final' team. They had Shaw, David, Weyland and a few military goons, while in AtMM, it was just Dire and Danforth.

At around this time, the main thread between Prometheus and AtMM is drawn; the fact that an advanced alien race made something as a tool, but it backfired and basically caused their extinction. The Engineers made the black goo as both a tool to create life AND as a biological weapon, and the Elder Things made the shoggoths as a tool. However, both died at their creations hands.

Furthermore, in AtMM, it is implied that the Elder Things created humanity. In Prometheus, the whole point of the movie was that the Engineer's would seed life on planets. It is also shown that both the Engineers and the Elder Things were scientists, and when they were reawakened, they basically freaked out about the situation and went, for lack of a better word, ape shit.

The story then basically diverges for the rest of the film, but I will make the last comparison, being the shoggoth eating the Elder Thing's head. In the end of Prometheus, a creature brought about from the black goo attacks the reanimated Engineer ala the facehugger from the original Alien. It shows the final confrontation between creator and created, with the creator subsequently losing, much like in AtMM. And also like AtMM, only two of the main characters made it through the entire film; Shaw and David, who are the analogues of Dire and Danforth.

So, though Prometheus is different in some places, it is actually REALLY difficult to not see parallels between the two stories.

As for his shuttered H.P. Lovecraft adaptation ""At The Mountains Of Madness"" project that got killed in 2011, del Toro said he's going to try one more proper kick at the can soon. ""I'm going to try it one more time. Once more into the dark abyss,"" he laughed. ""We're gonna do a big presentation of the project again at the start of the year and see if any [studio's] interested."" And yes, Tom Cruise is still game to be on board if they can find a home for it. ""Yeah, Tom is still attached. I think it would be so fantastic to make it with him.

*I would certainly have loved to interview Lovecraft, and could not think of a better place to do so than in some cloistered hall at Brown University (which, regrettably, he was unable to attend, although I was lucky enough to do so). The funny thing, of course, is that many of my own tastes and predilections have been shaped or inspired by Lovecraft--not only his own particular favourites in weird fiction (Machen, Dunsany, Blackwood, etc.), but such things as colonial antiquity, atheism, and so forth. I came to Brown chiefly to study Lovecraft and, more generally, to soak up the Lovecraftian atmosphere of Providence, R.I. No one can understand Lovecraft without thoroughly absorbing this colonial haven, which remains much as it was in his day.*
 
**What would you like to ask him if you could?** 

*It would be tempting to have a debate with Lovecraft on the matter of race (I am perennially amused by his comment in a letter of the 1930s, ""The more one thinks about India the more one wants to vomit""--a comment, I imagine, inspired by the turmoil in India caused by Gandhi), but I suspect we would not make much headway in the matter, since Lovecraft believed he had science on his side to justify his prejudice against blacks, Jews, and others. I think it would probably be safest--and, in fact, highly stimulating--to discuss with him the nature of weird fiction and individual weird writers. Lovecraft had a remarkably keen understanding of the philosophical and aesthetic foundations of weird fiction, and I have quite frankly appropriated many of these in my own writings on the subject.*
 
**Given his own martial interest and Anglophile, his attempt to enlist etc, why didn't Lovecraft's later fiction reflect the greatest known horror of his time, that of the Somme, Ypres and Paaschendale?** 

*This is certainly a curious thing, since World War I was such a culturally traumatic event throughout the Western World. One might say, however, that in the US (which was only involved in the war for a year and a half, in 1917-18) the effects of the war were not quite as devastating as in Europe, and Lovecraft, in his early creative years, did not feel that weird fiction should make explicit references to political, social, or cultural events; he felt that such references might detract from the atmosphere of weirdness that he wished to establish. I did write an article (""Topical References in Lovecraft"") that claimed that there are more references to the war than one might initially think, but they remain peripheral to most of the stories in which they occur.*

**Though we are aware of your idea in your work  that Lovecraft's early illness was more psychosomatic and that it was alleviated after his mother's death, I have long wondered if there was an alternative source of Lovecraft's poor health and unique visage: Could he have suffered the genetic problem Marfan's Syndrome, whose symptoms include overall poor health, cardiac weakness, early death and in some cases elongated limbs and visage. Have you ever considered or heard this possibility about Lovecraft?**
 
*I don't know anything about Marfan's Syndrome (of which, indeed, I have never heard), and it would certainly be worth exploring. However, some of the symptoms you outline (e.g., elongaged limbs and visage) don't seem to fit Lovecraft's condition (unless you are referring to his prognathous jaw, something he clearly inherited from his mother). I still think the psychosomatic explanation is more satisfactory, since the remarkable improvement in his health coincided so precisely with his mother's death (something he even alludes to in ""The Thing on the Doorstep""). However, more work on this matter is warranted.*
 
**Given all your extensive study of Lovecraft...do you like him?** 

*Do I like him as a person? Well, yes--I think he is almost entirely an admirable human being (excluding, of course, his racism). He was kind, generous (with his time and even with what little money he had), morally upright (didn't lie, steal, cheat, etc.), and actually had a good sense of humour. His intellectual and aesthetic gifts speak for themselves. ... But if you mean, Do I like his work, I can say that I have actually not re-read his stories in a long time, but I suspect they would still carry something of a punch--and, quite frankly, I might even gain some new insights by a thorough re-reading, since Lovecraft's work is of a sort that always reveals new things upon a fresh reading. Currently, I am reading little of his work except his letters (I still hope to publish his complete correspondence, in at least 25 volumes), and even the shortest and most perfunctory of his letters has something of his distinctive personality. There were times in the past when I thought I was getting a bit tired of Lovecraft (especially when I was spending two full years--1993-95--writing my biography), but I now have enough other interests that, when I come back to Lovecraft, I still find him refreshing and engaging.*
 
**OK, time for lunch! ... Hope the above is satisfactory. Feel free to prune or edit as you wish.**

Joshi to participate in an AMA. However due both to pressure of work and not being enamoured of online forums he declined. So we (/r/Lovecraft) had a discussion and collected some questions for him to which he very quickly and kindly responded. We are deeply appreciative.


**It is popularly held that Lovecraft has been one of the greatest influences on modern horror literature, but Lovecraft's own stories weren't exclusively horror stories. Often they had traces of science-fiction as well, especially in his later works. Do you think Lovecraft has had as big an impact, or any impact at all, on modern science-fiction as he has had on horror?**

*In answering this question, I am hampered by my relative ignorance of science fiction in the generations after Lovecraft. As a youth I did read some Asimov, Heinlein, etc., but it never connected with me the way horror fiction did. But my understanding is that Lovecraft is indeed a presence in science fiction, albeit in general a covert one. Some science fiction writers have reacted with great hostility to Lovecraft: Asimov referred to him as a ""sick juvenile,"" and Avram Davidson wrote a famously ferocious screed that accused him of nearly every literary sin imaginable. I think much of this hostility (among Golden Age science fiction writers, at any rate) resides in the fact that Lovecraft's bleak view of the future (in which humanity, already dwarfed into insignificance by powers incalculably greater than they), will merely die out and give way to other species) is in stark contrast to the generally naive optimism of mid-century science fiction. And yet, Arthur C. Clarke has testified (in his autobiography ASTOUNDING DAYS) how much he enjoyed Lovecraft's two long stories in ASTOUNDING, and I have to believe that Philip K. Dick has been influenced by Lovecraft. Nowadays, with science fiction itself becoming somewhat bleaker in its outlook about the future (as typified by steampunk, cyperbunk, and the work of such a writer as Charles Stross, who has indeed been markedly influenced by Lovecraft), I think there is more receptiveness to Lovecraft in the SF community.*

**What was it that drew you to Lovecraft originally? Why have you developed such an interest in him?**

*I think it is a good thing to have discovered Lovecraft as a teenager--which is far from saying that he appeals only or even predominantly to teenage mentalities. It is at that age when one is looking for literature beyond mundane reality, the weirder (or more imaginative) the better. I came upon Lovecraft at about the age of 13 or 14, in the course of delving into weird and mystery fiction in general. I recognised from the outset that his work featured an intensity of vision (expressed chiefly in his dense and occasionally flamboyant prose) that was rare in weird fiction except in such writers as Poe or the early Bradbury. I think that even at that early age I had already come to find such standard ""monsters"" as ghosts, vampires, and werewolves to be stereotypical and unconvincing, and Lovecraft's extraterrestrials--realised with such meticulous precision, as in AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS--seemed to me an extraordinary imaginative conception. As I learned more about Lovecraft, I was struck by parallels--some superficial, some more significant--in his attitudes and mine: love of cats, love of the past, atheism (I was not then a full-fledged atheist, but Lovecraft's writings largely made me one), and so on. There was a time when I almost entirely identified myself with Lovecraft (for all our differences in upbringing, ethnicity, etc.), to such a degree that, in my own nascent attempts to write horror fiction, I would often mimic Lovecraft's ideas without the faintest realisation that I was doing so.*

**What's your favourite poem/story/letter?**

*My favourite story remains AT THE MOUNTAINS OF MADNESS, for its extraordinary richness in detail and verisimilitude, and for its tremendously powerful concluding tableau (the emergence of the shoggoth), which to this day I regard as perhaps the single most terrifying passage in all horror literature. Among the poetry, it is difficult to discount FUNGI FROM YUGGOTH, but I have always had a fondness for the brooding poem ""The Ancient Track,"" which I believe I once memorised. And there is a touching little two-stanza poem (not a weird poem), ""Sunset,"" which I find ineffably poignant. ... It's funny that you should mention the possibility of a ""favourite letter."" There is a letter to Frank Belknap Long (Feb. 22, 1931) that I think is one of Lovecraft's greatest literary accomplishments. (This letter is in fact misprinted in SELECTED LETTERS III, where it has been conflated with another letter of slightly later date.) This letter is not only full of substantial discussions of philosophy, aesthetics, etc., but is written with a verve and passion that make it unique.*

**How do you think he would react to the seething mass of humanity that is the internet, beyond the initial poking, prodding, and scepticism?**

*It is always a bit dangerous to pluck an historical figure and place him in our day and ask what he would have thought of modern developments. I imagine Lovecraft would have been disdainful of the Internet, chiefly because it does not allow for the slow and careful digesting of knowledge that he (correctly) identified with true learning. But conversely, Lovecraft was always keen on having the most up-to-date knowledge in many areas of inquiry, and I imagine he might have made tentative use of the Internet to keep up on such developments. But of course this is all conjecture, and rather idle at that.*

**While you have clearly established yourself as the pre-eminent authority on Lovecraft you were once the new kid on the block, turning to elder fans like Yozan Dirk Mosig and Kenneth W. Faig, Jr. Are there any new Lovecraftian critics whose work you think deserves wider exposure? Any young scholars you would care to champion?**

*I would certainly like to take the time here to acknowledge how much help and advice I received in early days (and in some ways even now) from my elders in Lovecraft scholarship, chiefly beginning with Mosig (whose correspondence with me constituted a virtual tutorial in the study of Lovecraft), Faig, David E. Schultz (still my closest colleague), George T. Wetzel, J. Vernon Shea, Peter Cannon, and several others. As for younger scholars, I confess that I am a bit disturbed that not many of these have emerged in the past decade or so, but I think there are a number of people doing outstanding work. Robert H. Waugh (my senior by at least a decade) will be publishing a second collection of essays on Lovecraft, all of which are highly stimulating. Another scholar, T. R. Livesey, has done some outstanding work on Lovecraft's interest in science, especially astronomy. This is a field in which I myself am woefully deficient, and Livesey has written some keen articles showing the links between Lovecraft's scientific enthusiasm and his weird fiction.*

Thank you for the inquiry.

We are primarily a Christian bindery. We also do repairs and restoration on items outside the Christian influence. However, creating artistic bindings requires some special insight into the book. Our binders are not comfortable working with occult literature, so we'll need to pass on this one.

Obviously this demanded a retort and so I responded thusly: 

Hi, Eric.

I appreciate your prompt response, but find it slightly unusual that you consider the works of Lovecraft to be occult. He was a fiction writer that wrote short stories in the horror genre, and while some of his writings were somewhat dark (as horror fiction tends to be) they were hardly meant to be taken literally. However, if you are uncomfortable working with it that is certainly your prerogative.

That said, not everything should be lulz.

This has all been said before, and yet we still end up removing an average of about one post each day (sometimes more) simply because the subject matter is light, comedic, of little to no real tangible relevance to Lovecraft or Lovecraftian horror (tentacles alone do not a Lovecraftian reference make).  The last few days have been busier than normal.

If you have some lulz send it over to /r/cthulhu, where lighter fare will not be removed.  

It's not just funny/lighthearted pics though.  Pictures of books are frowned upon as well.  Photoshopping tentacles to something is, too.  Comics (not graphic art...we're talking lighter stuff here) as well.  Lighthearted pics of crossovers (e.g., ___Enter_Famous_Character_Here__'s Encounter With Cthulhu) are also ill-suited to this sub.

The idea behind this is that there are innumerable subreddits that are either intentionally for funny or lighthearted stuff, or have evolved into nothing but that despite any intentions otherwise.   

Let's all try to keep /r/lovecraft a place for Lovecraft, Lovecraftian horror, and weird fiction.  This can come in any number of forms and yes that includes pics if they really do fit the bill (there is some really spooky Lovecraftian art out there).  It also includes movies, rpgs, video games, statuary, buildings (we had a great post recently about the church that inspired Haunter in the Dark), music, et al.  Heck, even news stories/scientific reports that have Lovecraftian implications are nice.  And, possibly most of all, it includes books.  

Are you reading something in the vein of Lovecraft right now or have you read something recently?  Give us a post containing a link to it and/or a review of it.  There are probably others here who have read it/are reading it/want to read it/want to learn about this sort of thing.  I'll be posting a couple of reviews tonight, relating to Ramsey Campbell and W.H. Pugmire. 

Also, reporting links that don't fit here is a big help.  Also also, please downvote the lighter fare and upvote the appropriate content.   We check the sub regularly, but not incessantly...so any help you can give in keeping the place tidy is great.

So in short: Lighter fare is for /r/cthulhu, not /r/lovecraft.  Consider /r/lovecraft  to be the /r/TrueReddit of Lovecraftian content.  Please report and/or downvote lighter fare.  Upvote the meatier stuff.

I don't like adding meta posts like this one, but due to the increased volume of lulz (most of you have not seen the bulk of them, thank Shub-Niggurath) I felt it was necessary.  I'm not trying to pick on anybody here...if you're into Lovecraft, welcome.  Some may not know that there are two subreddits, or that this subreddit is a little more choosy.  As a rule, the folks who post and comment in this sub are amazing and I am grateful for those who do so.

Thanks for your time and all the help many of you are already providing.",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,False,,,True,t3_vh16a,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/vh16a/some_clarification_about_rlovecraft/,moderator

First, please welcome your two new mods **[cthulhufhtagn](http://www.reddit.com/user/cthulhufhtagn)** and **[santiagopazm](http://www.reddit.com/user/santiagopazm)**. Ia!

There has been some discussion in comments and posts recently about the changing nature of r/lovecraft. All successful growing reddits face the same dilemma: as user numbers increase the reddit becomes a greater tareget for karma-whoring. 

Calls from mods and users more inclined to the original sub-reddit ethos for a retrenchment or re-alignment are usually met with at best a shrug of the shoulders, (as has happened here).

Therefore the time has come where we must attempt a rebalancing. Both the new mods have been vocal in calling for better quality of discussion and submissions. They are not alone, I know many of you agree with these calls.

The reddit rules on the sidebar have served us well with little change for over two years since KBPrinceO and 8-Mighty-Arms implemented them. But recently people have been completely ignoring the guidelines.

So before you post a submission please consider whether your post will add to or edify in some way the community. Ask yourself if you are simply karma whoring. Example submissions which fall very definitely into this category are Cthulhu (Lovecraftian) tattoos, pictures of you showing your book covers, memes and rage comics. These may be funny or unique to you but they do not add to the community as a whole. We will be taking a harder stance on these submissions in future. 

Are you posting because you recognise only Cthulhu as a pop culture meme? Why not (and no disrespect intended to mod airbrushedvan) try [/r/Cthulhu](/r/Cthulhu) instead?  Got or getting a Cthulhu tattoo? [/r/tattoo](/r/tattoo) or [/r/tattoos](/r/tattoos) are your place. Made yourself a Cthulhu wool hat? There's [/r/knitting](/r/knitting), etc, etc. 

These are general guidelines. Will we lose users as a consequence? Possibly but if the only reason they were here was karma whoring that's a price we're willing to suffer. We'd prefer however that they stay and learn more about Lovecraft, add original user creations, participate in discussion and questions of Lovecraft and his works. 

For example: subjects we do not see enough of which are always open for further exploration: 

Lovecraftan anthologies and reviews, 

Post-Lovecraftian authors, 

Weird fiction authors and Weird Fiction as a genre, 

Discussion of Lovecraft's many influences (Poe, Machen, Dunsany etc), his contempories and friends, 

There's always room for more original art such as user Duapo's excellent 2012 Mythos Calendar or original weird fiction

Thanks for your assistance and help in the re-alignment.

With that in mind, I'd love to see more actual Lovecraftian and/or Cthulhu Mythos content in all forms.

Articles, fiction, nonfiction, music, films/video, rpg (like Call of Cthulhu) games, et al.

If it isn't scary or unsettling, it doesn't seem to me to be applicable.

Yet were they too remote from humankind.

He wasn't too impressed by Lovecraft as a writer.

These seem like the words of someone who has never  read Lovecraft...

Sure, Lovecraft's preferred content could be viewed as a corner cutting tactic, but the reason I think he was a good writer, particularly regarding his descriptions, is because the things that he *did* describe, he described well. In fact, many of his descriptions are haunting and beautiful.

(No sculpting or artistic talent required).,TheGreatCthulhu,73,12,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/rt1a5/howto_make_your_own_call_of_cthulhu_statuette_no/,"We've all seen very expensive custom sculpted ones online. So here's how to make your own.

First you'll need a Fantasy Flight [Bag O' Cthulhu](http://www.amazon.com/Call-Cthulhu-LCG-Bag/dp/1589946006/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333553550&amp;sr=8-1).


Ok, now you've got lots o' Cthulhu.

1. Take one of the larger ones, and check the plastic model for any mould lines. They seem really well cast, but if there is any plastic ridge sticking up, file it off. Best do that at the start.

2. [Drill a hole up through the centre and glue some brass rod into it.](http://i.imgur.com/QDzmi.jpg) Make sure to add a twist at the end of the  rod. This is to give the putty something to grab onto in the next step. Oh, btw, file or cut down the edges of the base, I forgot to do it until after step 4.

3. [I had a bit of lead in the garden so I cut it into slivers and hot-glued it around the rod](http://i.imgur.com/YXaVK.jpg), then put some air drying putty around it. You could alternatively use some steel washers, ball bearing, wheel-balancing or fishing line weights.

4. [Next further build up the base with air-drying two part epoxy putty](http://i.imgur.com/LaXQY.jpg). I used Milliput White, because I already had some and it dries very hard. Don't try to do it all in one day. Do a bit, leave it dry overnight.

5. I cut some simple glyphs into the base with a mini drill engraver head, looking loosely like those on Lovecraft's sketch. 

6. [Spray the whole thing black in a few light coats](http://i.imgur.com/np1dE.jpg).

7. The CoC description of colour of course difficult: *a green stone colour with gold flecks like nothing ever seen on earth*. Green it is so.

8. [Mix a couple of acrylic greens and/or blue/greens. Add some black to make a dark green](http://i.imgur.com/iTxMn.jpg). Don't mix the paint uniformly but leave different streaks. Dry brush it on with a flat brush. In dry brushing, you brush most of the paint off onto a cloth until the brush seems dry, then apply to the figure. Paint will be left on the raised areas. With a bit of practice you can do this with a wetter brush and mix the colours a bit more.

9. I added a final highlight of a bright bronze acrylic mixed with green as a final highlight. Hit it with a couple of light coats of spray varnish. Finished statue is ~~6 inches~~ 10.5 cm high. The key to making it feel right is the weight we added when making it, which gives it a proper heft, unlike so many bad TV props. [Finished](http://i.imgur.com/79wzV.jpg).

10. Bonus: You now have most of a bag of Cthulhu's left over. One for the everyone in the family/cult for Summer Solstice?",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,True,,,True,t3_rt1a5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/rt1a5/howto_make_your_own_call_of_cthulhu_statuette_no/,

Never again. 

I don't think I could bear the burden of their understanding - or rather, the consequences of that understanding. But you, gracious stranger, you I can tell. I am free to paint a mural of text for your edification because we shall likely never meet. If by some unholy coincidence and we should lock eyes and mutually recognize that terrible *knowledge* burning in our souls, I shall have met a kindred spirit, rather than the personification of my guilt.

And so I will honor your request, sir, and attempt to explain my ""illness"":

Most days, I get up, perform the necessary ritual, and continue with my day as everyone does. I eat, I work, I play, I sleep - in short, I live my life. Oh, there are concerns - I worry about my father's recovery from surgery, I wonder how I shall pay my bills, I am annoyed and disappointed if I burn dinner - but if everything is not perfect, it is generally tolerable and occassionally quite pleasant. 

Some days, however, there is a haze in the air - not a fog of combined oxygen and hydrogen that can be seen with the eyes, but rather a miasma seeping through the porous skin of reality. I truly believe all people can sense this, but as a species we have learned ignore this ability - deliberately allowing it to atrophy in order to ensure our survival. The withered remnant of awareness is buried deep beneath the conscious mind, and lucky are they for whom it remains interred. 

Some of us are not so blessed. 

Trauma may wake it, as does death. This terrible understanding blazes outward from the eyes of soldiers and refugees alike. We introspectives foolishly dig up and examine every facet of our psyche, and ignorantly awaken this sense of the space beyond reality; an ineffable vast realm that should have remained obfuscated by ignorance. Someone once said, ""you gaze into the abyss, and the abyss also gazes into you."" He must have been one of us.

When the cloying miasma seeps into existence, the prudent observe their rituals more faithfully. We focus our minds on daily tasks and superficial events, and from this irrelevance fashion a blanket under which we can shiver, praying that the manifested nothingness does not find us. We impose upon ourselves a strictly enforced amnesia and avoid anything that might recall us to the horrifying presence of the abyssal tendrils blindly seeking us out. 

When the shadow passes, we injudiciously allow our awareness to return. Our carefully constructed fortress of inanity is allowed to dissolve, and arrogantly we embrace the undeserved intellectual superiority adopted by survivors of a catastrophe.

Fools.

One cannot help but realize this reprieve is temporary, though of course we must furiously and desperately pronounce it permanent. To do otherwise would be to fully realize that we are living Cassandra's curse - knowing our terrible fate but disbelieved and scorned for claiming such knowledge; we are *humored* by those we love, yet hear them scoff at such tales when we turn our back. It is a bittersweet comfort that those who scoff are spared the chilling weight of comprehension.

There will come a time when all preparations are insufficient - when the looming presence infilitrates my defenses and encroaches on every mote of my awareness. My body will continue to exist, an automaton repeating the last instructions given, dutifully performing even the morning protective ritual - a surreal mockery ignored by the insentient malevolence. Many will not realize that this moving, breathing being is but a husk, occupied by a decaying imprint of who I was. As for myself, I fear that I will remain aware as my will is slowly picked away, each memory individually degraded and discarded as I am digested by oblivion. 



Now that you know the nature of the ""illness"" I believe you will agree that it is quite incurable. 

Do have some more tea.

There are hoards of unique pictures of Lovecraft himself surrounded by or in proximity to tentacles.

But does it make sense?  *Should* it be the defining characteristic of Lovecraftian Horror/The Cthulhu Mythos?  How many of Lovecraft's own stories actually involve tentacles?  Certainly there are many stories dealing with aquatic horrors, but tentacles are - though present - much less common.

In his entire list of works, the word tentacle appears only 28 times ([apparently](http://cthulhuchick.com/wordcount-lovecraft-favorite-words/)).

Certainly, those coming after Lovecraft have gone wild (and continue to) with tentacles, including myself on a couple of occasions.  Why has the tentacle been featured more prominently in those he has inspired?  To what extent has Chaosium/The Call of Cthulhu fed off and also in turn fueled this phenomenon?

How did the tentacle become the symbol of Lovecraftian Horror?

Personally, I like it.  It's a pretty creepy, otherworldly thing  (very different from our own appendages) with an undercurrent of sexual implications.  Therefore, it does have the famous Lovecraftian compulsion/repulsion thing going for it.  I'm just curious how it came to be our signature emblem.",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,False,,,True,t3_t8dha,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/t8dha/questioning_the_legitimacy_of_tentacles_as_the/,

The first one is called 'Black Goat' and I personally think it oozes atmosphere. It's short, and I think it loses it's way a bit towards the beginning with the axe-gadget but all complaints aside it really is a great little short. (Canadian too, yeeep)

http://blackgoat.ca/

After watching this short I was directed over to the Lovecraft Film Festival website it won runner-up in. And wouldn't ya know it, guillermo del toro himself was a judge! He tied first place of the competition with two titles, one called 'Static Aeons' and another based off of Edgar Allan Poe's 'The Raven'.

Now keep in mind these are only short films, but hopefully they'll quench your thirst until we or someone else make a feature length film on the matter. Enjoy!

And I'm not saying that I don't like Lovecraft's work.  The bar for fandom has been set pretty high, so I couldn't really say that I like HPL as much as the next guy, but I've read a handful of his stories, two novellas, and that essay about supernatural horror.  I find his work interesting, entertaining and enjoyable.  But I'm never really scared by it, at least not any that I've read.

My personal belief is that (at least his better known works) work on a scale too grand to be viscerally terrifying.  Maybe it's my own temperament.  It's just that when I read a ghost story, I can be scared because, hey, maybe there's a ghost in my house.  But when I read about Cthulhu, no part of me is worried that there's a Cthulhu in my basement.  Is that a defect in my character?  Do you get scared reading those tales the way you get scared reading about a poltergeist or MIB encounter?

And a follow-up question: what HPL stories scared you the most?  I just got his complete works and I'm done with school.  Which story should I read if I want to lose sleep with fear?",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,True,,,True,t3_titg3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/titg3/genuine_question_thats_not_at_all_flame_bait_how/,

much less above everything else, he postulates gods that are immortal and alien to the extreme and neither care for us nor are kind to us in any way. Their motives are so alien that we do not typically figure into their plans except as food, sacrifices for pleasure, or to further their goals that would definitely be detrimental to us.

He says they are mad and emanate evil, but I think the madness would come from being immortal for eons, learning all they could, becoming bored, malignant and eventually insane from it. As far as emanating evil, I think they either have this as some sort of mental ability or that their appearance was just so alien to men of his time as to be utterly frightening and even beyond comprehension. I think their emanations of fear would be negated by a sufficiently scientific, rational mind or by someone who is already mad in some fashion, so that the fear does nothing to warp their mind.  We must remember that science was in its infancy when he wrote these stories, and that his purpose in writing was to induce the very fear and apprehension that his gods supposedly would emanate, so this may be purely an invention of his to enhance his stories.

The thought of immortal alien races far more advanced than our own and having agendas that ignore us or are not in our interests makes perfect sense. so does their madness over time, so their actions may appear irrational and even be 
ridiculous to them, were they sane, like sacrifice or converting humans into some sort of alien form similar to themselves.  ",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,1355768404.0,,,True,t3_14zzi6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/14zzi6/how_i_see_lovecraft/,

The deity/entity is repeatedly referenced in HPL's works, but is never detailed beyond being ""[Shub-Niggurath,] the Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young.""

Never do you learn what this entity actually is, what it does, what cosmic ""role""/function it serves. The other Outer Gods are vaguely described/defined, but you can at least reason that Azathoth is the center of the Universe, somehow the incarnation of its indifferent vastness and arbitrary destruction. In a way, it *is* the Universe, its ""true spirit"" or whatever. Yog-Sothoth is the Gate and The Key, the one who brings and/or binds realities/dimensions together, in this respect it is possibly even *more* powerful than Azathoth. Nyarlathothep the ""Mind and Messenger of the Outer Gods"", the one among them who has the capability of understanding/relating to mortal beings(while being a total dick, obviously).

I'm not really looking for ""canon"" answers here, i.e. I'm just interested in learning how others imagine Shub-Niggurath? What does it look like, what does it actually *do*?

I tried my hand at an illustration years ago, but in hindsight it's really dreadfully uninspired, being just a reworking of the ""great roiling mass with tentacles, random mouths and so on""-type of drawing.",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,False,,,True,t3_1hitsi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/1hitsi/shubniggurath_what_is_itshe_really/,

First of all, you have the patriarchal founder figure in Obed Marsh and Mr Chaco who both establish an industry by securing good fishing through the Deep Ones and by establishing the Chaco Chiken plant, respectively. The difference here is that Mr Chaco would be an amalgamation of all three Marshes(Obed, Onesiphorus, Barnabas).

Another similarity of theirs is that they both introduce their respective towns to a different faith from the Indies involving ritual sacrifice. Both faiths promise immortality, although the SoI one only to the Deep Ones/Human offspring.

The post-intro scene with the person who went insane after a brief visit to the town is also reminiscent of the fate of Robert Olmstead, the protagonist of SoI.

In terms of the town, they are both xenophobic, insular, and tightly knit communities. They contain the ""normal insider"" in Zadok Allen and Doris Kearns(Though extremely trimmed) and dysfunction in the disease for ""Our Town"" and the economic destitution in SoI. There are also visual similarities in the procession of lights, bonfire, and more.

To me it seems that ""Our Town"" was very much inspired by ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth""",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,False,,,True,t3_zzq4k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/zzq4k/our_townthe_xfiles_and_its_parallels_to_the/,

To me, I have a hard time seeing him as racist; rather I think he's xenophobic. He doesn't seem to ""hate"" other people, but feels very strongly about preserving his own (English) culture.  I wonder, too, if this is the source of the note of disapproval in *Mountains of Madness* where he talks about the ""decadence"" of the bas reliefs on the walls - that the Old One's culture was eroded and that led to their downfall.

I find it interesting, too, that he asserts that the only source of meaning in one's life is in one's culture and heritage, and that it is a great wrong to interfere with a person's connection with their culture.

Some quotes from Lovecraft's letters:

&gt;In other words, we are either Englishmen or nothing whatever. Apart from our inherited network of English ideas, memories, emotions, beliefs, points of view, etc., we are simply bundles of nerve-centres without materials for coherent functioning. Unless there exists an English world for us to live in, our total equipment of interests, perspectiveness, standards, aspirations, memories, tastes, and so on—everything, in short, that we really live for—at once becomes utterly valueless and meaningless and uncorrelated; a nightmare jumble of unsatisfiable outreaching, without objective linkages or justification, and forming only a source of illimitable misery. Of supreme importance, then, is the secure preservation of an English world around us. 


&gt;Nowadays we need more than the mere fact of being English in heritage and speech in order to keep so. We need the added and positive factors of being consciously and symbolically so, in order to offer the tangible resistance (a vigorous back pull, and not mere inertia) necessary to check decadence. When we fight the ideal of quantity and wealth, we must have the positive English ideal of quality and refinement to pit against it. We must have a rallying point of our emotional life in order to prevent the disorganising influences around us from recrystallising our milieu into definitely hostile and repulsive shapes. 

&gt;I hate the rebels of 1775 because they commenced a wreckage which is making their territory unfit for their descendants to live in. 

&gt;Within the lifetime of people now middle-aged, the general tone of our northern cities has so changed that they no longer seem like home to their own inhabitants. 

&gt;The loss of a collective life—of a sharing of common traditions &amp; memories &amp; experiences—is the curse of the heterogeneous northeast today. There is no real solution--&amp; all the American can do is to forget about the foreigners as much as he can, be on guard against alienation from his own tradition (apart from which he is lost &amp; deprived of that normal adjustment to a coherent fabric &amp; continuous historic stream which is everyone’s right), &amp; do his part toward cutting off further unassimilable immigration. 

(**EDIT**: I just want to make it clear that I have no emotional investment in the question of whether or not Lovecraft was ""really"" racist. If he was, then he was, and that's just life. Like sexism, I think racism comes in degrees, and can have varied origins, and it can be worthwhile to examine the nuances of an author's writing, in an attempt to understand him and his work better.)",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,1340994743.0,,,True,t3_vr1j2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/vr1j2/lovecrafts_xenophobia/,

The thing that struck me while looking at visual representations of Lovecraft on the web is that I found that Cthulhu is way over represented compared the rest of the author's invented deities but also compared to how often he's mentioned within the author's overall literary output.  

When you examine Google trends you find that, out of a peak search volume of 100, Cthulhu tends to net a 45 while Azathoth and Nyarlathotep each score 1.  When looking at overall trends, with just Nyarlathotep and Azathoth included, Nyarlathotep scores a 36 while Azathoth scores a 21.  Perhaps we could account for a higher Nyarlathotep score because of Lovecraft invokes him in his stories more often but I'm still struck by Azathoth's relative underrepresentation among fans.

When you look up Azathoth and Cthulhu on DeviantART you find a similar disparity.  There are 30,835 related images tied to the term Cthulhu and only 851 related to Azathoth.  Is Cthulhu being represented so often because there is a intertextual line of visual models (a history of representation) for artists to utilize?  Is Azathoth underrepresented because there is a lack of visual models or perhaps the complexity of his description does not lend itself well to representation?  Both of these creatures are imaginary objects but are represented through cultural materiality and on this point there is a huge disparity.  

Lovecraft did place Azathoth at the top of his invented gods' hierarchy and supposedly he was the source of deities such as Nyarlathotep, the Nameless Mist and Darkness.  A ""nuclear chaos beyond angled space which the Necronomicon had mercifully cloaked under the name of Azathoth"" has to be one the more remarkable concepts that Lovecraft originated during his monster spawning literary career.  So, going back to the title of my post, why do you think Azathoth is so underrepresented and do you see this as continuing indefinitely?  Is Call of Cthulhu such a popular story that it overwhelms the rest of Lovecraft's tales within this little subculture of fans?  Perhaps Lovecraft's literary circle and immediate followers did more to seed Cthulhu through references within their own works to the neglect of the author's other creations.

My friend thinks that it leans more towards survival horror.
My argument: 1. Alien shows that we aren't alone in the universe, and our cosmic neighbors are more horrible than we can imagine. This is classic Lovecraft, the aliens may not be godlike but they are terrible. 2. There are those that show a perverse interest in the alien, similar to the cultists in Lovecraft's fiction. 3. Sexual horror, there is definitely a sexual undercurrent to the Alien. Its head is phallic, the face huggers and chestbursters are reminiscent of rape. There was a sexual undercurrent to Lovecraft's work as well, many of his monsters share a vaginal motif.
Her argument: 1. Psychological vs. Physical: She argues that the Alien is an archetype of predator horror, similar to the shark in Jaws. The horror incurred by the Alien is more physical than psychological, as horrible as the Alien is it is just another predator. Nothing about it violates our most basic beliefs about the universe, unlike the old ones. 2. She argues there is no sexual aspect to the Alien. Her words: ""Yeah the head is phallic, so are their guns."" 3. She also argues that there is no apocalyptic threat in Alien. The movie is about the crew's attempt to survive not prevent the old ones from stir frying the planet.

http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1460165270/cthulhu-playing-cards/posts/317074

It seems to me that Chaosium are attempting to claim copyright/trademarks on not only ""Call of Cthulhu"" (for which they may have point - but should be easily solved by the name change) but also the Elder sign? I respect the Chaosium guys, having enjoyed their RPG, but almost everything they've done has been based on public domain works - I really don't think they have the right to be throwing around lawsuit threats to indirectly linked projects.

I'm hoping this will be the last of this nonsense with the name change, but it does make me worry. I wanted to bring this to the attention of r/Lovecraft as perhaps someone has some experience with this or even a contact within Chaosium?

**Edit:** well, it seems they've given in and are getting a license from Chaosium. I'm really not certain their rendering of the Elder Sign would be infringing - but I guess they didn't want to take the risk (fair enough to them).",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,1348761751.0,,,True,t3_10kbjl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/10kbjl/chaosium_appears_to_claims_copyrighttrademarks_on/,

As it was announced, today our topic will be *The Dunwich Horror*

Written in 1928, it was first published in the April 1929 issue of Weird Tales (pp. 481–508). TDH is being regarded as a core story of the Mythos. Lovecraft commented in a letter to Derleth that is was based on several New England legends, particulalry one involving the notion that whippoorwills can capture the departing soul. It is also said that some of the inspirations for this piece are the stories of British horror writer Arthur Machen, particularly The Great God Pan (which is mentioned in the text of ""The Dunwich Horror"") and ""The Novel of the Black Seal"". Both Machen stories concern individuals whose death throes reveal them to be only half-human in their parentage. According to Robert M. Price, ""'The Dunwich Horror' is in every sense an homage to Machen and even a pastiche. There is little in Lovecraft's story that does not come directly out of Machen's fiction.

Lovecraft took pride in ""The Dunwich Horror"", calling it ""so fiendish that Farnsworth Wright (editor of *Weird Tales*) may not dare to print it."" Wright, however, snapped it up, sending Lovecraft a cheque for $240, equal to $2800 in modern dollars, the largest single payment for his fiction he had received up to that point.

For those who would like a second look before they start to discuss:

http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/dh.asp

And for those whou would like to have it told to them, the honorable born_lever_puller (also known as Nyarlathotep's Left Nut) had the kindness of posting a [link to it](http://archive.org/details/NearlyCompleteHPLovecraftCollection).

In Shadows Over Innsmouth, Zardok Allen explains the port town's fall from grace at the hands of Captain Obed Marsh. For NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month) I've dropped my other writing projects to present a prequel to Shadows that follows the corruption and fall of the good Catholic Sailor, Obed Marsh and then the subsequent fall of his beloved Innsmouth. My question is concerning the interest that might be found in this. Is there any? What concerns would die-hard Lovecraft fans have? As a Lovecraft fan myself, I'm trying very hard to stick to mythos while also taking my own creative license. I also find that its important for me to keep to the voice of Lovecraft as closely as possible without losing my own writer's voice as well. I'm halfway through the novel now, and would love feedback on concerns or words of encouragement (encouragement always rocks). You can check out my cover I made for NaNo (not necessarily the final cover) here: http://nanowrimo.org/en/participants/spazenport/novels/the-trials-of-obed-marsh . If you're at all interested in looking into my other writings, you can check out my author page at Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/Matthew-Davenport/e/B004P44U8U/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1352757673&amp;sr=8-1

My homemade encyclopedia was mostly comprised of printed Wikipedia pages on zombies and aliens and whatnot and I wasn't really sure of it's purpose other than it was fun.

These were the days when every high schooler was using programs like Kazaa and Limewire to share music and images. I don't remember what I was searching for, but I happened to stumble upon a .pdf version of the Necronomicon. I was not yet a Lovecraft fan and was only vaguely familiar with the book from its appearances in video games. I had no idea whether or not the book was real and was surprised to see an actual copy supposedly existed. I downloaded it and quickly printed it for my collection.

The introduction explained the story of the mad monk Abdul Alhazred and nowhere explained that the contents of the book were a work of fiction (I would finally learn who HPL was years later.) The bulk of the book was a collection of thirty some odd demons and the proper spells to summon their power for specific uses. Memory fails me, but I seem to remember the demons in the book were closer to those of Christian mythology rather than Lovecraft's outer gods and the spells read like those from a spellbook on TV. For example, ""to invoke Baal to help with monetary gain, place a red candle in a northward facing pentagram, sprinkle salt around the edge and recite this chant..."" I never tried any of the spells because I was often lacking in the ingredients.

The night I printed the Necronomicon, a series of painful rashes started to appear over my body. I paid no attention to it at first, but for three straight days, I developed an inexplicable, itchy, bumpy rash that spread to every inch of my body. My mom, a nurse, rarely worried for me, but was freaking out by day three when I had a 104 fever and uncontrollable itching. 

I explained my weird illness to my friend over IM and he jokingly suggested it was because I had a copy of the Necronomicon. It was funny but, to a slightly superstitious, easily encourageable teeanger, it almost made sense. I snuck out of my house with my printed copy of the tome and a lighter to meet my friend at the ditch behind my house. We were going to ritualistically destroy the infernal book. To a couple of sixteen year old boys, ""ritualistically destroy"" meant ""light on fire."" 

We found a spot out of sight from the public and began to burn the pages. It was only overcast in the sky, but the moment we touched flame to paper, it began pouring rain and blowing incredible winds. At this point we were pondering if the text really was cursed. After a couple fruitless attempts to light the book aflame, we tore it into a million tiny pieces and buried it in the sand beside a sewer pipe. 

Maybe it was all a psychological thing, but the rash and fever faded almost immediately. I felt right as rain by the time I got back to the house. I deleted the digital copy of the Necronomicon from my computer as soon as I had the chance and vowed to never illegally download scripture from the nether realm again.   

I read my first HPL story (The Music of Eric Zahn) when i was twenty and was immediately hooked. It was only after reading a few more of his stories that I recognized the common themes, curiosity of the unknown, diving head first too far into discovery and regretting the consequences, and ultimate resolution of the consequences without a satisfactory explanation, that I realized I had experienced something very similar to these characters, albeit to a somewhat lesser degree. 

For what it's worth, my friend and I revisited the spot where we had buried my printed copy several times and were never able to find the torn pieces in the sand. ",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,False,,,True,t3_qcao5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/qcao5/im_pretty_sure_i_was_a_character_in_a/,

I hadn't read anything by him since I was in highschool, moved on to different literature, but my buddy and I were talking about him earlier this week and I decided to plunge back in.  I started where most would, The Call of Cthulhu.  The story is, of course, great, but some of the descriptions of black people are abhorrant. I don't know why I didn't realize this in high school.  Maybe because I lived in the south and I thought perhaps these ideas were commonplace in the early 20th century, but upon doing my own research today I found this was not the case.  Lovecraft's racism is quite extreme: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft#Race.2C_ethnicity.2C_and_class  
and taken from another reddit post: http://www.heretical.com/miscella/hplc-dr.html

If you dig around you can find other quotes that I don't think need to be posted here.

So a few questions: Do you think this has prevented Lovecraft from being taught in schools?  He is unquestionably an excellent writer and I would say his work is having just as much influence as Poe's.  Also, should the personal views of an author determine whether or not his material is appropriate for the classroom?  Finally, and of more interest, can we use Lovecraft's work  to begin discussions on racism, especially since his work so intimately conveys feelings of xenophobia as one of its core themes?",,False,self,t5_2qjt4,False,,,True,t3_j83pn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Lovecraft/comments/j83pn/so_the_elephant_in_the_room_lovecrafts_racism/,

Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.

Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep,

Then once by man and angels to be seen,

In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.

There is a joke comedians tell each other called the Aristocrats, there was a movie about it but just in case you haven’t heard of it this is [Wikipedia’s description of it;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aristocrats_(joke)

*The setup: The joke always begins with a family act going in to see a talent agent.*

*Those who meet the agent can include the whole family or just one family member (usually the father).*

*The agent asks what they do (sometimes after saying that he is not interested, and a plea from the father).*

*If the whole family is present, the act may be performed for the agent, rather than described.*

*2.The act: It is described in as much detail as the teller prefers.*

*While most tellings follow one of a few basic forms, the description of the act is meant to be an ad lib.*

*Traditionally, the description is crude, tasteless, and ribald The goal is to significantly transgress social norms. Taboo acts such as incest, rape, coprophilia, coprophagy, beastiality and murder are common themes.*

*3.The punch line: The shocked (or intrigued) agent asks what the act is called, and the proud answer (sometimes delivered with a flourish) is: ""The Aristocrats!""*
 
You may have heard this joke or a variation this joke and not realized it was a secret handshake for comedians. I know I had never heard of it and I had tried to be a stand up comic in my younger days. (The less said about that the better.) The idea is to have your version outdo the previous tellings in vulgarity. Bob Saget explained that the beginning and end of the joke is set, the middle joke is where you have free reign to do whatever you want.

Now you may wonder what the Hell this has to do with Lovecraft, well it occurred to me recently that in a certain way a lot of Mythos/Lovecraftian fiction follows a similar structure.
 
Consider the way many of our favorite stories go;

1.The setup: The story begins with a protagonist, usually an innocent academic or unlucky bystander

In many cases the story is told in the first person viewpoint.

The protagonists own tale is frequently told in a nested format with other people’s stories making up his tale. The final part of the Call Of Cthulhu is a good example of this; the main character never sees Cthulhu in the gelatinous flesh, he just relates to us what he read in another man’s journal.

The more our hero learns the more of what he thought to be the rational world falls away.

2.The investigation: The protagonist is frequently exposed to a secret society, cult or lineage that has transgressed social norms. In almost all cases worship or direct exposure to the Mythos has either been the cause or result of their transgressions.

The protagonist then either encounters undeniable evidence of the Mythos or an actual creature of the Mythos. The encounter could be with an established aspect or creature or could be a entirely new creation but this is the part that has the most elements of the author's imagination and style.

3.The Conclusion The protagonist has his worldview utterly shaken, or goes mad or dies. In some stories the world itself is destroyed which is a Hell of a worldview changer.

So, what do you think? Do you agree,? Disagree? Need a SAN roll?

""What is CthulhuTech?
CthulhuTech is an innovative storytelling game that started out as a combination of two popular genres. The first was that of cosmic horror, made popular by H. P. Lovecraft and culminating in the modern day with elements of Mike Mignola’s Hellboy and John Carpenter’s In the Mouth of Madness. The second was that of giant mecha Japanese animation, made popular by such series as Robotech, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Rahxephon. But the setting has grown far beyond what it started out to be. CthulhuTech is now a truly unique hybrid of genres – cosmic horror, anime, post-apocalypse, traditional horror, and science fiction blended together seamlessly.

Ultimately, CthulhuTech is set in our world less than one hundred years from now, though as unrecognizable to us as we are to the people of the early twentieth century. Through the unorthodox blending of arcane principles with modern science, Humanity has created an inexhaustible power source that has revolutionized the world. Hand in hand came greater cosmic understanding and the acceptance of what was once thought to be magic. Our blossoming power brought an alien race that had hidden amongst us into the foreground as they descended upon Earth to enslave or destroy us. Celestial mechanics have brought ancient sleeping gods back into our world. The Aeon War rages and three-quarters of the people on Earth have been wiped out. But, combined with the might of unexpected allies, the New Earth Government makes certain that we will not go gently into the dark night.

It is in this rich setting that players take on the roles of hot-shot mecha jocks, staring down the front lines to save the world, self-sacrificing Engel pilots, who have psychically attuned themselves with giant cybernetic monsters, knowledgeable occult scholars and powerful sorcerers, who use an understanding of the hidden world and cosmic laws to bring eldritch power against our enemies, brave combat soldiers, fighting where giant machines cannot, and frightening Tagers, who have undergone lost rituals to bond in symbiosis with a thing from beyond space and time. And these are just a few options in a much larger world.

Built on Framewerk
Gone are the days that hobbyists wanted intricate, complex mechanics in their games. Simple, intuitive systems like White Wolf’s Storyteller or Eden Studios’ Unisystem are now the order of the day. Even Wizards of the Coast’s d20 has been streamlined from its more complicated days.

Framewerk, the proprietary system upon which CthulhuTech is built, is not only simple and intuitive, it is cinematic, exciting, and puts destiny back in the hands of the player. Its easy to grasp nature makes the game straightforward to learn and quick to start. Its clever dice mechanics make even the simplest of task resolutions exciting.""


**TL:DR** Cthulhu Tech is an amazing game where you fight lovecraftian horrors in mechs or in bio-mech made out of lovecraftian horrors. While that sounds a little silly the execution is very well done and you get a definite sense of horror.
So go grab your free PDF and enjoy!

Do you think Lovecraft had, as this person stated, deliberately wished for his work to be bastardized?  Is there no wrong way to do Lovecraft?

What do you think Lovecraft would think if he could see what has been done with his creations today?  What would he think of things like Hello Cthulhu and Cthulhurotica?  Do you think he would sit down for a marathon run of Jeffrey Combs movies?
