Please stop. 

The reason why the developers opened Torchlight to modding is so that YOU can play the game the way YOU want to play it.  And if you make a public game and someone joins that IS cheating, you will know and make a choice. However, please do not condemn people for playing the game the way they want to.  

It's perfectly reasonable that you only want to play the vanilla game, no respecs, carefully choosing points and grinding it up.  

It's also perfectly reasonable that people don't like to grind gear, money, exp, or whatever, and feel like using cheats/respec potions/mods to help them progress at a faster pace.

But, it is completely unreasonable to expect everyone to only play this game YOUR way.  Do not complain about cheaters, as you choose whether you play with them or not.  Do not complain about about missing a global economy.  Do not complain about abusing glitches, it's your choice.

In the end, the game framework is here, everything expected in a MRPG.  Now that you own it, it's time for you to start playing it your way.

Before getting notice that doing so would have branded the character a cheater.. I went ahead and did it... because I was so eager to get it done. (Eager.. I know.)  Then I got the warning. Well shit.

Let's see.

This is a level 23 Ember Mage that I've been playing with my brother *since the start* of the game, we're maybe a little ways into Act 2, ... and my character has been branded a cheater.

I have four options.

1:

Reroll.

2:

Cry about it.

3.

Rage quit.

4.

Something I don't think will work... because it's 11:41 PM EST. E-Mail Travis Baldree &amp;/Or Runic Games support and bawl my eyes out like a six year old kid who has just recently had their candy taken away from them and admit they were a cheater.

----
Option 1 went over for about... 20 minutes.. cut to 12:10 AM EST.

&gt;I severely screwed up my character, so I thought I'd respec him using the console command to respec him.

&gt;I didn't know this would brand him a cheater.

&gt;This makes me sad because my brother and I have been playing the game together from the very, very start.

&gt;If I sent you my character saves, I don't know which ones he is.. He's named Minifig, the Embermage that's level 23, could you please, *please* clear him as a cheater?

&gt;All I wanted to do was fix my skills because they were so badly broken. :( 

----



20 seconds later I get a nice little message in my inbox:

&gt;Here he is, de-cheated-

1348733666.0,178,self.Torchlight,10jzcv,Attack animations in Torchlight 2 - why kiting feels awful,rewision,214,36,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10jzcv/attack_animations_in_torchlight_2_why_kiting/,"The ranged classes in Torchlight don't have the same tools for surviving in combat as the melees do; heals that is. The Outlander and the Embermage are supposed to kite in order to stay alive, however, kiting doesn't feel as fluid and good as it could, like it does in, say, Diablo 3.

Well why is that? The attack animation in both of the games are sped up or down so that the loop completes as the next attack can be started. The difference is that in Diablo the player can interrupt the animation almost instantly after the projectile is fired, allowing them to move around. In Torchlight, however, the animation cannot be interrupted. The problem isn't very evident when using a bow or a crossbow, but the amount of 'air' pistols have in their animation is glaring.

The inability to interrupt an attack animation causes two problems: firstly, kiting feels awkward and clunky in a game that is supposedly fast paced. Secondly, if a player kites they cannot get the full DPS out of their weapons.

Well, why is this a problem then? Both the melee classes can pretty much get their full DPS out while keeping their health up; the engineer with the healbot, passive shield and the occasional forcefield, while the Berserker mainly just has to attack, with the crit proc, shred armor, battle rage and the occasional shadow burst. Their mechanics for survivability aren't dependent on them being able to move around in combat as much as the ranged classes, especially the Outlander has to.

Letting the player interrupt the attack animation prematurely would lead to exactly one problem: you couldn't initiate an attack whenever you were moving. If you tried to attack before the attack timer had reset in Diablo 3, the character would keep running towards the location you clicked to and would execute the attack command once the attack timer allowed it. This happened regardless if the premature attack was queued with a shift-click or a click on an enemy.

This wouldn't just have to be changes for the ranged attacks, though. I don't see why this couldn't be done for the melee classes as well. I mean, it wouldn't even look weird if the attack stopped when the weapon hit the enemy, it's not like you could inflict partial damage onto someone with a halberd and still have it pass through them in real life. This would give the melee characters more mobility when dealing with huge monsters with slow attack animations that are meant to be dodged. And on the whole, every class' spells would feel more responsive when cast mid-combat as they would execute sooner rather than later.

TL;DR: Players should be able to interrupt attack animations once the damage was dealt.

Edit: [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFgTh0x_fM4) a comparison between the two games. Two notes: the diablo crossbow has a .05 seconds faster attack timer and I get full dps out of it, unlike in Torchlight.",,False,self,t5_2rb10,1348756326.0,,,True,t3_10jzcv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10jzcv/attack_animations_in_torchlight_2_why_kiting/,

1348236976.0,132,self.Torchlight,108yh3,My review of Torchlight 2 thus far,Uberslaughter,166,34,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/108yh3/my_review_of_torchlight_2_thus_far/,"A little preface: I invested months of my life into D2 and while the graphics haven't aged well, still feel that it's one of the best games I've ever played. For many reasons that I won't go into (decade wait not withstanding), I was really let down by D3. Yet I still took all 5 characters to 60 and some to past that to paragon. Suffice it to say after a decade, the final experience didn't come close to my expectations. 


I never played Torchlight, heard some buzz about TL2 and kind of forgot about it until a few days ago. I spent yesterday doing researching and watching some trailers/gameplay videos on YouTube and made the decision to pull the trigger last night. $20? What the hell, why not. I spend that on dinner eating out.


Wow. No, not WoW. WOW! The only apprehension I had about purchasing was the slightly cartoonish art style, but that quickly subsided as I became fully immersed in the game. From the opening screen, the music sucked me in. Vaguely reminiscent of the Tristram theme from D2, but still unique and enjoyable in it's own way. 


I rolled an Engineer and before I knew it, had hit 15. I'm trying to be as objective as possible (and granted I'm only a few hours in), but I'm having a hard time coming up with any negative feedback. 


The combat is awesome. Took me a minute to figure out, but as soon as I found a cannon and sunk some skills into Blast Cannon (I waited till level ~6 or so to start investing skills/stats), it was game over. 


Everything is so convenient and intuitive, but not to the point of being easy or dumbed down (which is how I felt playing D3). I love the pet system and the fact that you can send them from town, removing inconvenience and down time. It all just feels so well thought out. 


The loot system is awesome. One of my biggest gripes with D3 post-patch was how theirs works. I feel like they almost did it intentionally to get people to utilize the RMAH. I've been finding awesome items frequently and have even purchased a few upgrades from the town vendors. What a novel concept!


The fact that, even though I couldn't link my steam account to my runic account and play online with my bud last night, was a non-issue. I can play off-line single player and import him later once the servers finished getting their collective asses, understandably and deservedly, kicked. 


The humor incorporated into the game is actually funny and not cheesy and some of the item names and their subsequent descriptions are hilarious.  


I can feel the love and passion that the Runic team put into this game. You all did one hell of a job and put out a high quality product at an incredible price point. I thank you for that and now that things seem to be running smoothly, take a deep breath and pop some bottles. You guys deserve it.

Uelmen's score is incerdible. From the guitars, to the drums, to the creepy ambient music, Uelmen's work evokes all the perfect emotions. It is so vital to the gaming experience, and it is one of the main reasons I feel that Diablo III failed in capturing that ""Diablo"" feeling (aside from the artistic design that Blizzard decided to go with, of course). It's just not the same without Uelmen's brilliant work, and I am glad to see it in this great game (which, imo, feels more like a true Diablo successor than Diablo III ever did, even with it's artstyle). 

Another aspect of the game which I don't see enough credit given to is the sound design, specifically the creature sound design. Perhaps it's just me, but the creature sounds are very reminiscent to those in Diablo I and II, and that is by no means a bad thing. In fact, coupled with Uelmen's score, it makes for an experience which is both unique and nostalgic in many ways.

I've never done anything like this before. I don't represent a company or anything like that. Really I just love video games. I have been a gamer all my life, but I have recently just been astonished by the customer service at Runic Games, particularly one of the employees Travis taking time to help individuals. This really impressed me, and I thought I would take a chance to support them! I thought I could spend the money on borderlands, but heck, why not give back every once in a while! So, hopefully there are 12 of you out there who are interested in this! Little background on myself: I am a 24 year old high school teacher and have been for a few years now. I love teaching and I love my students, so I hope you don't mind me getting them involved in this a little!
In order to decide who gets the 12 copies, I will do it with a small competition that you can choose from. Sorry if you don't like competition!

4 Copies will go to the best Torchlight related drawing (needs to have evidence that it was done for this contest)

4 Copies will go to the best Torchlight poem

The last four copies will be decided as follows: if you could give ONE piece of life advice to my students (predominately poor and behind in academics), what would you say? :)

You can just post your entries in the comments. If you enter, most of all have fun with it :). Hope you guys are willing to participate! Thank you so much.

Edit: I forgot to mention. First, don't just try to bum a copy if you already have one (sorrryyyy, wanna help those who don't have it). Second, the contest will end Wednesday night at 11:59 CST. I will look at the entries Thursday and post winners so those people can start playing Thursday night/Friday for the weekend! :)

Edit 2: Hey guys! Just wanted to let you know that there is just over 8 hours left to submit! Get your submissions in! Also, I have a cool surprise for those who have been providing life advice. It's not a copy for all of you, but it is something cool (I think at least). Carry on!

Edit 3: Thanks for all the submissions guys. I will post the winners tonight!

While TL2 is quite popular, it is not popular enough to support this limitation and will fracture the multiplayer base very badly as it already is doing. I know Runic designed mostly with playing with a smaller group of friends in mind, but for many of us online MP with some random folks is a big draw for us. 

Please Runic consider removing the limitation and allowing those further along in + tiers to go back and play with folks not as far in. A filter in the server browser to show only certain tiers, or all tiers, would resolve this. If it is a technical limitation then I hope you will spend the time to fix it - it would mean a lot to the community.

I've seen this brought up a lot, but as players aren't that far in yet, I think more discussion is still going to be popping up as more have the same problem.

With any game that allows random pairing up with other players comes people who want to upset others by ruining their hard work. 

Griefing isn't a new activity in the gaming community, but we can do some simple things to avoid it, and hopefully lessen the chances of it happening.

* We have an [Official /r/Torchlight Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/RedditTorchlight) group where you can find other like minded players and users of our wonderful community. This is a great tool to meet new players (and eventually friends), and removes the ""random"" element.

* Use our weekly ""[Looking for Partner](http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/109bez/official_week_2_coop_partner_search_thread/)"" co-op threads to find players who are also from our subreddit. We're able to moderate posts and ban players who use this as an avenue to cheat.

* The [Runic Games Forums](http://forums.runicgames.com/) are a great place to also find players. The /r/Torchlight moderation team has no ""jurisdiction"" over the Runic Games community, so use this at your own discretion.

As always, if you have any issues with cheating, hacking, or other negative behavior, do not hesitate to contact any of the moderators listed in the sidebar. 

As the community grows after Torchlight II's launch we will undoubtedly encounter a few hiccups, but we can all be vigilant in doing the right thing by other users.

1349138389.0,101,self.Torchlight,10shpn,The case for Embermage: class mechanics for newbies,stigmate,120,19,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10shpn/the_case_for_embermage_class_mechanics_for_newbies/,"So you want to roll an embermage but you feel a bit overwhelmed by the amount of skills and how they are supposed to work? Here you will find a brief explanation of some key mechanics and how to use\not use them.

Stat:
--

* Focus: this stat increases your elemental damage, both on skill and on weapons. It's your go-to stat if you are going for the classic caster approach.

* Vitality: mages are squishy as hell, so I'd argue that vitality is your second best stat to invest on, especially if you play on veteran+.

* Dex: just for the critical strikes.

Weapons:
--

Staves and wands are the key weapons for this class, and using one will alter the way you play the embermage. You can ofcourse use any other weapon (granted to meet the requirements), but those two types are what define the class.

* **Staves:** Staves are empowered by the passive [Staff mastery](http://torchlight2armory.com/skill?i=Staff%20Mastery): this talent will apply elemental armor debuff to all the target hit by either your staff itself (basic attack), or by ***skills that use staff damage***. Staves are a melee weapon, and so you will need to go 'in the face' if you want to use the basic attack.

* **Wands**: Wands are seriouss business, and so using [Wand chaos](http://torchlight2armory.com/skill?i=Chaos%20Wand%20Passive) will make your dirty work even more dirtier. The passive adds a random effect to each attack dealt with the wands (basic attack), or by three specic skills only: Magma Spear, Icy Blast and Shockbolts skills. The random effect can be, in no particoular order: bigass meteor, acid rain, vortex that blocks your foes, and many others. Wands are (very short) ranged weapons and can be dual wielded for additional badassery. Wand + shield is the perfect combo for veteran\elite.

Either of the two are viable, although they offer different bonuses: I'd say that staves are more coop oriented, as your group can benefit greatly from the elemental debuff you will place on the targets; wands are just fun to use with their random effect.

Skills:
---

Here comes the interesting part, the aspect of the embermage that most of the player didn't notice, yet is the biggest mechanic of the class: the distiction between skills that use **weapon dps** and those that scale entire (or mostly) off **the focus stat**.

Be aware: Although focus increases all elemental damage, the modifiers appear to be way lower for weapon-dps scaling abilities.

**Examples:** 

* Weapon DPS skill: [Icy blast](http://torchlight2armory.com/skill?i=Ice%20Blast). As you can see, its damage is dependant on your weapon damage (30% for rank 1). This means that to get the most out of this skill you will always need to pay attention at your weapon damage, upgrading it along the way to keep the skill's damage up to par.
* Focus scaling skill: the infamous [Prismatic bolt](http://torch.light2armory.com/skill?i=Prismatic%20Bolt). It doesn't matter how badass your weapon damage is, this skill will base its damage only upon your focus stat. 

Since you are going to dump 90% of your stat points into **Focus** as an embermage, it should be clear why skills like prismatic bolt are so good (and unbalanced) especially in the early levels where the weapons are mediocre. Also, you are gaining Focus not only on each level up, but by gear also; on the other hand you only gain weapon dps through your weapon.

Both category benefits from + all damage, + elemental damage.


Now, there's another interesting mechanic: while it is clear that only 3 skills trigger **Chaos wand**, it is more subtle to understand that **focus scaling skills** do not trigger Staff Mastery thanks to the line *""The effects are also applied to any skill using staff damage""*: since Prismatic bolt doesn't factor weapon dps at all, staff mastery won't get into play at all.
This means no elemental armor debuff with prismatic bolt and staves, not even a chance. Also, please notice how the three skills that procs **Chaos wand** are all skill that base their damage off weapon-dps: focus-skills don't trigger wand chaos either.

Basically: 

* if you are going to use focus-skills you are better off not taking either staff mastery or wand chaos at all, because you won't benefit from their effects. If you are building around **prismatic bolt** (or **infernal collapse** etc) and you want to spend talents into the two masteries then please consider that you will apply their effects only by using **base attacks**, which you shouldnt be doing in a usual nuker build.

* Staff mastery and wand chaos complement theirself very well with all the weapon-dps scaling skill, so go for those two passive talents if you want to use (mostly) skills like: Icy blast, magma mace, arc beam, etc.

To conclude:
--

Now, I ***think*** I understand what Runic had in mind: split embermage's ability in two category, one that would perform better with high-level (or end-game) gear, and that would be furthermore empowered by passive talents (Staff mastery, chaos wand); one category that would perform better regardless of gear level instead, but would not yeld any bonuses upon using - as in no elemental armor debuff for example -; the former being the **weapon-dps skills like icy blast**, the latter being **focus-scaling skills like Prismatic bolt**.

I hope this will help you understand how to build a mage and how to use class mechanics at your advantage.

A few devs have generously donated copies of their games, including Torchlight II, Tiny Troopers, The Magicka Collection and Crusader Kings II, to give out as prizes during my marathon.

I thought that the best way to do this would be pick winners from anyone who donates a £2 min - meaning the charity gets money and you could get a great game for the fraction of the price!

1351202613.0,90,self.Torchlight,12397l,"How Arc Beam and Shocking Burst work, and how to use them effectively.",Zikel,105,15,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/12397l/how_arc_beam_and_shocking_burst_work_and_how_to/,"A lot of people are saying that those 2 skills are weak and I think this is because they don't really understand how they work.

So I did a bunch of tests, here is what I found out.
_______

It is true that both of them **do NOT apply** Staff and Wand mastery, any conveys on hit and chance on hit effects and of curse health/mana on hit.


This is because they attack very fast, how fast ?

______

From my observations:

**Arc beam: 5 hits per second.**

**Shocking burst: 7.6 per second.**


Now you see why they don't apply on hit effects. If they did for example apply Staff mastery, with only 3 ranks in that passive both skills would drop the resistances of multiple enemies down to zero in less then 2 seconds!

_____


* It is very important to note that **those skills are affected by casting speed, higher casting speed = more hits per second.**

With 100% bonus casting speed Shocking burst will be hitting 15 times a second, applying on hit effects 15 times a second on multiple targets would be absolutely ridiculous.

______

*   But **there is one on hit effect that is applied and that is  -x armor on hit.**

This means you don't need staff mastery to quickly drop the armor of enemies to 0, a single armor shredding ember gem will do the job!

For example a level 36 gem removes 31 of all armor per hit for 5 seconds, with no cast speed bonuses Shocking burst can remove 1178 of all armor with just one -31 armor ember.

______

* Also very important is that **those skills cost mana per second, so no matter how much faster they attack the mana cost remains the same.**

So casting speed greatly increases your damage output (100% bonus cast speed = double **total** Arc beam damage) at no additional mana cost.


______
The tooltips are not clear enough and forget to mention some things.The % of weapon DPS listed in the toltip is damage per hit.
So it really means :

* Arc beam with no bonus casting speed does 50% of weapon DPS per second at rank 1, 120% of weapon DPS per second at rank 15.
Also the flat electric damage listed is done 5 times per second.

It is also not mentioned that **Arc beam gains increased range with every rank**, it is something like at rank 15 arc beam has double the range of rank 1.This makes a huge difference.

* Shocking Burst with no bonus casting speed does 148% of weapon DPS per second at rank 1, 258% of weapon DPS per second at rank 15.

Note that the electric damage this skill does is done over 1 second, so that damage is not increased by casting speed.

Also note that the damage over 1 second primes Lighting brand and any of the 7+ attacks per second can activate the brand, making it amazing for using lightning brand to the highest possible efficiency.

If you want to compare the 2,  Shock burst uses slightly less mana and does quite a bit more damage, but because of the greater range Arc beam is much easier and safer to use.",,False,self,t5_2rb10,1351203016.0,,,True,t3_12397l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/12397l/how_arc_beam_and_shocking_burst_work_and_how_to/,

Outlander build advice:

&gt;Outlander - Some comprehensive advices

&gt;Another thing about dex: 110 dex + max charge + max dodge mastery + max &gt;share the wealth yields max dodge (75%) for outlanders. In practice, your dex &gt;will be higher than this because a lot of good outlander gear has dex on it. &gt;Once you reach around 110 ""natural"" dexterity, put your points into str (for &gt;physical attackers) or focus (for poison builds). Vitality is questionable, unless &gt;you are using a shield build in elite hardcore.
&gt;Shotgun builds are hard, but highly viable. You can perma-blind bosses with &gt;rapid fire and shotgun mastery. At upper levels str and focus are viable, but &gt;you'll level easier as str (unless you are playing a hybrid glaivelander).
&gt;Oh, and rapid fire, chaos burst, and vh (maybe shadowshot) transmits procs (% &gt;chance to cast a spell) and DOTs from your mainhand weapon, as well as &gt;shotgun mastery status effects.
&gt;Shattering glaive is exceptionally long range. You can use it to snipe dangerous &gt;things.
&gt;Venomous hail, chaos burst, shadowshot (but NOT rapid fire) all work if you &gt;have a gun in your left hand, but will use right hand dps. If you go focus and &gt;equip a wand in your right hand, you can do insane damage (and proc effects). &gt;Your gun just becomes a stat booster. Search for one with +crit damage or &gt;other &gt;stats. (Empyrean on the official forums developed this build, I'm making &gt;one as a hybrid glaive/chaos burst/VH focus build. Might have a guide up soon).
&gt;edit: Minimum viable cookiecutter glaivelander, for people who like things to just &gt;die and don't want to worry about anything:
&gt;Dex to 110 Foc all the rest Build focus first to gear, then dex, then the rest in &gt;focus
&gt;Glaive throw: 5 points
&gt;Rune vault: 1
&gt;Dodge Mastery: 15
&gt;Share the Wealth 15
&gt;Master of Elements: 15
&gt;Stone Pact: 15
&gt;Repulsion Hex: 5+
&gt;total points: 71 of 132. Everything else is optional. Cursed daggers is &gt;probably worth a full investment. Gear: wand+shield or double wand. &gt;+Focus, + %poison +%all damage are the desired modifiers. Socket with &gt;dr%, health, or focus if possible. At low levels, socket weapons with mana &gt;steal (act 2 rift ember will serve you well). Past Act 2-3, you should not be &gt;autoattacking ever.
&gt;spells: Concentration. All others are optional.

Stat and skill points issues:

You get 132 Skill points only , 100 from leveling and 32 for Fame ranks

You earn 5 stat points per level, atm there are a few known issues with leveling stats

Vitality is underpowered, getting a max of 100 points in it is enough to reach the max block cap(75%) with the right scrolls(+12% block) and shield, the HP per point is too low and you will gain much more by having gear with bonus armor, vit or HP 

Dexterity has its diminishing returns, for berserkers, when you have 226 points in it + Battle Standard you reach the 75% Cap of Dodge, Surely the +% Critical Hit chance is good but you might not want to put many points beyong the above said  here

Focus and Str are points that will be raising the damage of your skills(if they are Weapon DPS% based they need STR, if they are * improves with level, they are magic and need FOCUS)

Now the reason why you shouldnt bother too much with your stat points is that, in a certain moment of the game you will meet a powerful enchanter known as Borris, this guy can help you achieve much more than 1000+ points in a certain stat (if you have the money and luck) via enchanting your equipment, it is pretty common to have at least 200-250 points in every stat around lv 80

There are a few types of enchanters and the most important are

&gt;* **Jurick** (Puts a maximum of 2 sockets in your gear)
&gt;* **Borris**( Attribute enchanter, maximum of 3)
&gt;* **Master Enchanter**(powerful enchants, maximum of 4)

Maybe it just made it to Steam today.

Anyways, patch notes:

GRAPHICS: 
 
* Intel HD graphics cards should not show ghosting/smearing effects if shadows are enabled

PERFORMANCE: 
  
* LARGE performance optimization to buff/debuff bar displays when there are a large number of overlapping, nonexclusive effects (damage over time, and duration based effects or knockback )

SKILLS: 
 
* Shield Bash bonus damage now deals the stated amount(charged and uncharged)
* Wolfpack will properly strike turrets
* Bonuses due to proximity now always expire properly
* Damage bonuses/reductions for Battle Rage properly expire
* Fixed Critical Hit bonuses on some effects not properly incorporating bonuses to crit
* Pet damage bonuses are applied to effects

LEVELS: 
 
* Three Sisters zone now has an appropriate level range for proper NG+ reward scaling
* Various issues resolved in Luminous Arena in multiplayer
* Level determinism fixed (Was broken with precacheing in previous patch - could result in triggerable elements and some structural elements re-randomizing on load, or in multiplayer)

ITEMS: 
 
* Set reward for Inquisitor set altered to a functional bonus
* Fixes to the summon skull proc on equipment (prevents it from spawning exactly on a target)
* Effects based on proximate monsters now work properly with socketables
* DOTs were not properly attributing experience if the effect was applied from an item instead of a skill

MISC: 
 
* Target Dummy is Charm resistant
* Fixed issue where rebinding Close All Menus could lock you in pause mode
* Fix for shift-click casting a left-click spell and then selecting an item (would previously auto-attack)
* Pet enhancing bonuses work more consistently for pets attached to OTHER pets",,False,self,t5_2rb10,1350588630.0,,,True,t3_11pe0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/11pe0f/new_torchlight_update_300mb_just_started/,
1349172612.0,83,self.Torchlight,10t5ya,Feedback from an experienced hardcore mode player.,Nukemi,102,19,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10t5ya/feedback_from_an_experienced_hardcore_mode_player/,"Hi,

I love torchlight, it is one of the most rewarding hardcore experiences ever, in it's on way. There is nothing more fun in my list currently than trying out different builds and swimming in the amount of loots i receive.

I have died on several 50+ characters by now, and im in no way a bad player. I have played hardcore mode since beginning of diablo 2 and diablo 3, and never even touched the softcore mods. I consider myself a top class hardcore player with several years of experience.

However, in TL2, something is a bit off.

I know how to build my characters, i have a very very good idea how to balance damage and durability of my character, but in TL2 the balance between spike damage and normal damage is a bit too high.

Every character i have died with has been instakilled so far, and i had absolutely no way to react to that.

I've had decent resists (at least 2 slots of different armor embers in each slot) and still this is the way i go every time, and there is nothing i can do about it. 

The hardcore is near perfect on TL2, but i would like to ask the mods (if possible) to read this feedback and think about the damage some monsters are able to spike through.

I do understand it is very nice that there is a challenge all the way from the beginning till end, but the challenge should not just be avoiding being instakilled, it should be more consistent.

The biggest problem is that, it is very difficult to prepare to this. I always pimp my characters to the fullest, mainly focusing on durability and defensives. But in the end, nothing can prepare me for this.

In other games, you can get an indication from normal monsters of how much some champions/bosses can hit. They do manage to make your healthbar budge, but they are hardly able to kill you. This for me, usually indicates that i need to be very careful with champions/bosses of that type i might encounter.

However, in TL2 my Hp bar might not even budge for 30minutes in a row, and then suddenly, a boss appears and instakills me. And i can not do anything about it.

I think this requires a bit of tweaking, to make this amazing experience even more amazing.

Thanks for reading!

Ps. I do not give a damn if i die really, i have died in so many games so many times i've lost count ages a go. But, i think that this needs to be looked at in order to make TL2 even more amazing than it is. With occasional spike damage like this, it is hard to enjoy hardcore to the fullest.

This is not intended to start a flamewar; I'm just pointing out what the views of many people are. Many of you will disagree with some or all of the opinions presented here; I understand that. Please don't hate me.)

1. Harmonix creates Guitar Hero, an instant classic that defined its genre. That game set in stone virtually every mechanic and trope that would be emulated by countless imitators.

2. Harmonix releases a sequel, which iterates and improves upon the original in virtually every way. It easily eclipses the popularity of the original, and (despite feeling a bit dated in 2012, especially compared to the rest of the genre) is still regarded by many as the genre's pinnacle. They also released an expansion pack (I'm considering Rocks The '80s to be an expansion pack).

3. At some point, Harmonix splits from its publisher, RedOctane. Meanwhile, the publisher gets assimilated into the Voltron that is Activision, taking the rights to the Guitar Hero name along with it.

4. Activision takes a bunch of experienced developers from a different genre, and releases Guitar Hero III. Backed by an enormous budget and an even-bigger marketing campaign, it quickly becomes an earth-shattering success, despite being regarded by many as a soulless cash-in, with the personality of the first two games being replaced by something unmistakably corporate. The game smacks of a money-grab, what with all the product placement and Activision's policy of flooding the market with discs instead of releasing DLC. The launch is also plagued by technical issues (the Wii version had to be recalled because they accidentally mixed the whole game in mono).

5. Harmonix releases Rock Band. Its sense of style and personality, its carefully crafted production and its general fun factor make it the game of choice for many fans. It becomes successful, though not quite as successful as Guitar Hero III.

6. Harmonix releases Rock Band 2 and 3, cementing their positions in many peoples' eyes as the kings of music gaming. Instead of going in the same direction (or lack thereof) as the Guitar Hero series, they instead focus on refining and expanding upon the gameplay experience, without losing their own personality. Those games are now regarded by many as the true successors to Guitar Hero, and the new pinnacle of the genre. (The astronomical number of songs available as DLC doesn't hurt either.)

1. Blizzard North creates Diablo, an instant classic that defined its genre. That game set in stone virtually every mechanic and trope that would be emulated by countless imitators.

2. Blizzard North releases a sequel, which iterates and improves upon the original in virtually every way. It easily eclipses the popularity of the original, and (despite feeling a bit dated in 2012, especially compared to the rest of the genre) is still regarded by many as the genre's pinnacle. They also released an expansion pack.

3. At some point, the Blizzard North staff split from Blizzard and form Runic. Meanwhile, Blizzard gets assimilated into the Voltron that is Activision, taking the rights to the Diablo name along with it.

4. Runic releases Torchlight. Its sense of style and personality, its carefully crafted production and its general fun factor make it the game of choice for many fans. It becomes successful, though not quite as successful as Diablo III.

5. Activision takes a bunch of experienced developers from a different genre, and releases Diablo III.

The game smacks of a money-grab, what with the always-on-DRM, and the RMAH and the balance decisions that come along with it. The launch is also plagued by technical issues (Error 37).

6. Runic releases Torchlight II, cementing their positions in many peoples' eyes as the kings of ARPGs. Instead of going in the same direction (or lack thereof) as the Diablo series, it instead focuses on refining and expanding upon the gameplay experience, without losing its own personality.

However, I did not like D3 because it had none of that, and GW2 is complicated. I would not hesitate to buy Torchlight II if someone didn't tell me people can simply mod their items or drop rates, and essentially have the best items to use in PvP etc. This sounds really bad to me. D2 was 10 years old, and did not allow mods to be online, how can Torchlight II have this possibility? Are there a few as I like to call them ""hackers"" like that playing? If not, I'd totally get this game. I'd like to hear your feedback on this. Thank you.

Edit: Also, are there runs? I love runs.

Edit2: Thank you all for your replies, I greatly appreciate it! Yes, I am worried about that economy, and the interference of the mods. As somebody suggested, Runic has to devise a way to separate modded characters into online play. But I could see it being difficult if you just mod the drop rates, and get items, then go online.

EDIT: Here's the list, thanks to teh_eria:

    STABILITY
    *Fixed a potential crash bug when applying affixes and effects in certain circumstances
    *Fixed rare crash when turning in quest in the Undercurrents.
    *Put in protection against character save file corruption. Corrupted characters will not appear in the list of characters. (And thus can't cause the game to crash on load)

    SKILLS
    *Fix for Berserker geyser proc showing up as a mappable skill.
    *Fix for triggering Shocking Burst and Arc Beam out of range while hitting shift that could cause chain casting.
    *'Resist Slow' affix fixed.
    *Proc affixes scale better with player level.
    *Berserker 'Wolf Shade' now has the (intended) 60 second cooldown applied to all ranks.
    *Fix for mistriggering when chaining two skills together when there is an early hit-frame.
    *Safety check to stop any looping skills that get stuck in the 'on' state when the character is not performing a skill.
    *Fixed bug with 'Poison Burst' procs (they should properly engage at more distant ranges).
    *Fix for potential issue when units would queue removed/unavailable skills.
    *Fix for having more than 100% reduction to charge decay or a negative flat charge decay.

    PERFORMANCE
    *Made significant optimizations to particle collisions.

    SYSTEMS
    *Fix a bug when recalculating the price on objects to make sure the calculation is based on the correct data.
    *Fix for bug where rapid clicks could misspend stat points.
    *Removed access to console commands in multiplayer games.
    *The game's login dialog now correctly allows passwords up to 64 characters long.
    *Removed display of other users' IP addresses in multiplayer games.
    *Removed Steam Cloud toggle in the settings file (it didn't do anything); the ability to toggle is available in the Steam client.
    *Removed logging for achievements to potentially reduce some FPS drops for some users.

    LEVELS/SCRIPTING
    *Tweaks to various areas to prevent units from getting stuck.
    *Changed lootable rocks to be non-colliding as they could occasionally block very narrow corridors.
    *Fixes to some level scripting logic in the Frosted Hills.
    *Fixed a bug that could cause multiple Tower of the Moon entrances to appear in the world.
    *Implemented a few specific boss room pathing fixes.

    ACHIEVEMENTS
    *Fixed friends list based achievements.
    *Spell-learning achievements now don't incorrectly trigger based on other players.

    MINOR
    *Fixed several typos.
    *Improvements to journal tooltips.

Wow. I never expected this place to get this big. I looked at /r/planetside getting to 10,000 before the surge here and thought that it was such a feat compared to our paltry 3,000 or so. 

Yet here we stand, about 8,000 members bigger than when I first stood at the helm of the subreddit about five months ago. [This Red Bull is for all of you guys. Cheers!](http://i.imgur.com/QctAA.jpg)

As an added little bonus, I am going to announce a new activity to start, well, right now: the /r/torchlight challenge runs. These will last for two weeks a piece and will normally start on Fridays, with the results due by the time the next challenge post is out. Our first week will be a relatively easy one. The shield only run. You must only have a shield equipped at all times, nothing in the other hand. Play on the highest difficulty and with hardcore mode on. When you die, take a picture of where you died and you character on the character select screen and we can all laugh at you or stare in awe of what you were able to accomplish. There will be special flair rewards to everyone who participates and an even more special one for those who manage to complete playthrough 1. I've also heard rumblings about actual tangible (not tangible, digital) rewards for whomever gets the farthest. More on that on Friday.

Tips for the challenge:

* If you want a generic sort of build, go Aegis engineer. You can get shield bash and sword and board to increase your offensive power

* Don't be afraid to try a new character on an easier difficulty to get your build right. You have two weeks and the game isn't that long

* Turn off auto equip items

* You can play however you want until you get a shield :)

Other stuff

* Try not to cheat. I am not going to go through everyone's skills and calculate if they respecced or if they hacked an item in. These are for fun, so why rob yourself of it?

* Feel free to give me ideas for challenges. I have a couple rattling around in my head right now, but I am very open to suggestions on how to improve it.

* I'll post a thread next Friday that you can start putting results in, so no rush.

* Once again, thank you for to the old crowd for sticking around after the beta, there really was quite the drought of content for a while there. To the new crowd, I'll officially say welcome aboard now! I see that most of you are already acquainted here, but it's better late than never.

My favourite method comes from Act II. The Genie Djinni gives you a few tasks including heading through a trial of sorts called The Luminious Arena. Although quite tough for a lower level Embermage (melee range champ mobs are frequent) if you level up through at II and come back when it's a grey area for you, you should still find you can breeze it.

Here's the nice part. You get a host of fame from running it, you get at least one Mysterious item from killing a large boss mob at the end, and you can repeat it indefinitely. My friend and I went for about 20-30 runs and almost completely decked ourselves and our alt accounts out in Orange quality gear.

Also, on a side note once you complete the first area (with the light) stick around at the last chest for about 20-30 seconds and a lever will spawn, leading you to two more large chests and a mysterious statue that will drop a trinket that gives you 90 something life steal. Beast of a trinket, I now have one on each fist weapon I wield. &lt;3

At the moment until it's patched (if it'll be patched) you can also reset any phase beast room by logging out and back in again whilst in the phase room. Complete room.

I was stoked about the game the very moment I beat the 1st one. How where they gonna flesh out the world, story, this art direction, etc? I bought it off of steam during a sale, immediately fell in love with it. My step son and GF both caught a glimpse and started playing too. We were playing so much we setup the Spare room to be the Torchlight room. I setup a dropbox with our stash files and with careful coordination and backup cycles we were able to share items with one another. 2 was announced and we couldn't have been happier with the simple idea of playing together.

Then it came out.. I had been out of work for nearly 6 months and I had to hear stories of all my friends enjoying it. So I did it! I pirated the game 2 days after release. I was going to set up a LAN with tunggle, etc. The issue was, he entire time I felt bad, terrible actually. Runic put a lot of work and soul into the game. The game is super fun, deep and amazingly priced. So I felt terrible about gypping them from money to pay their employees to keep making kick ass games. The fact I didn't have a job didn't justify me pirating it. It's a video game, a luxury item, so I should learn to do without.

Then I got a job! Nothing fancy but a simple web development project for a mom and pop shop here in my hood. So I just got paid today and with my 1st check I'm not only buy one but a 4 pack to share with my family. We are really stoked, ordering lots of pizza, and playing Torchlight II all night tonight. =)

I know there is the argument that chances are, someone who pirates a game will buy the game down the line, but very rarely do you hear from people who do this very thing. I'm adding to the very likely miniscule pile of testimonials of people who pirated a game, felt genuinely bad, and bought the game to support a company. Sorry guys, didn't want to wait to play. Hope you can forgive me..

There are some players who love and support the idea of an offline mode, but at the same time they hate on the individuals who use the console or back up shared stash files. An important thing to understand is the trade-off that occurs between these two. Torchlight II trading away cheating security and any chance for legit competitive PvP or PvE for having an offline mode. All of these trade-offs are fine for what Torchlight wanted to do. It is a fun, casual, non-competitive action RPG. Sure, legit tournaments and competitions can still happen among close groups of friends with a certain level of trust, but the idea that you can host public tournaments and competitions without players ""cheating"" is ridiculous.

TL;DR If you support offline mode, it is silly to argue with people who use the console or file manipulation to ""cheat"". It is not against the ""spirit"" of the game, because the spirit of the game is to simply have some good casual fun.",,False,self,t5_2rb10,False,,engineer-decal,True,t3_11ddop,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/11ddop/the_tradeoff_between_offline_mode_and_competitive/,

1364530810.0,47,self.Torchlight,1b8364,Tip/Reminder: Enchanters will respawn along with enemies.,Xen0nex,54,7,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/1b8364/tipreminder_enchanters_will_respawn_along_with/,"This may be common knowledge already, but just thought I'd post it in case others were under the same misapprehension I was.

So, looking back I never actually heard someone *literally* say that once Enchanters ""wander off,"" they are gone forever, but somehow I got that idea in my head and there isn't really any info out there (that I've been able to find) that clearly tells you how it really works.  With how big a deal people were making of how rare certain Enchanters were, or rerolling worlds to keep looking for the same Enchanter, or ""parking"" an Enchanter with a Waypoint Portal, I just assumed it was the case.

So I did a quick little test last night, and it seems that Enchanters respawn along with all the enemies in an area when it ""Repopulates"" (Not Rerolls), even if you've already used them and they 'wandered away'.  

**Thus, the only real reason you'd ever need to use a Waypoint Portal to ""Park"" someone is:**

**A.**  If you found the Enchanter in the Mapworks, and want to keep using other Maps without losing him

**B.**  If you used a Vendor Boon Scroll and need to ""park"" him

To explain in **great unnecessary detail**, here's how it seems to work:

* If you encounter an Enchanter somewhere, he will stand still until you use him to enchant something

* **Disenchanting** does **not** make him ""wander away"" (This has been very convenient with Fondo (who disenchants for cheap), and eventually if I ever find the one who disenchants for free.

* Once you use him to enchant something, as soon as you close the Enchanting dialogue box/panel, he begin to ""**wander away.**""  Once he walks off the edge of your visible screen (approximately), he disappears from the area.  (You can sort of work around this by placing a Waypoint Portal right next to him, and very quickly portaling in/out of the area before he gets a chance to walk offscreen, effectively ""**parking**"" him there.)

* **However**, an Enchanter is just like any other part of the area, and so will respawn along with any enemies, Locked Golden Chests etc. when the area ""Repopulates.""

All areas in the game ""**Repopulate**"" after certain conditions are met.  ""Repopulating"" causes the following effects in that area:

* The map becomes fogged over / unexplored again

* All enemies/Champions/Bosses respawn

* Any regular or Locked Golden Chests reset

* Any collectible items in the area reset (E.G. the elemental crystals in The Sundered Battlefield)

* Any Enchanters respawn

* Any Shrines reset.  Notably, any Monster Shrines seem to remember what particular thing(s) they summon.  When I found one that summons a **Golden Crab**, I was able to farm him by repeatedly visiting other Overworld Areas in rapid succession to make his Shrine reset.

When an area ""Repopulates,"" the following things do **NOT** change:

* The shape of the map for the area remains exactly the same

* The locations that items/enemies/Enchanters were in are the same

* Which areas you are allowed access to remains the same (Unless unlocking it involves collecting items in that same area, E.G. you need to collect the elemental crystals in The Sundered Battlefield again to access the Elemental Oasis)

* Your progress for any completed Quests

* The level of the enemies remains the same


It is important to note that an area where you have placed a Waypoint Scroll Portal will **NEVER** repopulate until you move your portal somewhere else.  It seems that placing a portal in Singleplayer mode, and then resuming the character as an Internet/LAN game, can **sometimes cause portals to disappear**, and vice versa, so be careful.  [Causing an area to ""Repopulate""](http://forums.runicgames.com/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=40118#p358478) depends on what type of area it is:

* For **Overworld** areas (The big huge places like The Temple Steppes, The Mana Wastes, The Sundered Battlefield, etc.), they will repopulate once you've entered at least 2 other Overworld areas.  

* For **Pass** areas (The short paths that connect you to Overworld areas like Crow's Pass, The Rotted Path, Rivenskull Gorge, etc.), they will repopulate once you've entered at least 2 other Pass areas. 

* For **Towns**, same rule; visit at least 2 other towns.  This is mainly useful for quickly refreshing the stock of the town's merchants.

* For **Dungeons** (Basically anything with only one entrance, often has multiple floors and is smaller), they will repopulate 10 minutes after you enter a different Dungeon area.

Note that **Mapworks Maps** seems to basically count as Dungeon areas.  Since you can always revisit your last Map by clicking the bottom button at the Map Selector even without a Waypoint Scroll, you can cause them to repopulate (in 10 minutes) by entering another Dungeon.

By comparison, **Rerolling** your world does everything that Repopulating it does, but *additionally* **randomizes** all of the maps, layouts, Champions, Rare Secret Dungeons on some Overworlds, Enchanters etc. in all of the areas of that character's world.  Rerolling only happens if you check the ""Reroll World"" box when starting an Internet or LAN game.  However, it is important to note that if you join another player's Internet/LAN game, your character inherits a copy of their world, **overwriting your world**, which is much the same as a Reroll from your perspective.

**tl;dr:**

**If you find an Enchanter somewhere, don't freak out.  Use them whenever you want, and if they disappear, visit other areas until they respawn and then come back.**",,False,self,t5_2rb10,1364532823.0,,engineer-decal,True,t3_1b8364,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/1b8364/tipreminder_enchanters_will_respawn_along_with/,

Eventually though, the rush went away and so did the items. It became a need. I'd farm levels to get gold only to spend it all on items, and at this point I was rarely getting any unique cannons at all. I'd buy maps for dirt cheap in Mapworks just so I could scrape up the gold to buy the next cannon. It typically ended up in dismay and melancholy. This is not a sob story or one written for the purposes of attention; it's a cry for help. My gambling addiction has taken over to the point I can't play without him being my first stop. Somebody, anybody... I can't do this alone any longer.",,False,self,t5_2rb10,False,,,True,t3_116mov,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/116mov/true_life_gambling_addict/,

Story time:
Dateline 1993.  Max Schaefer, Erich Schaefer, and David Brevik start a game company called Condor.  Blizzard then buys out Condor and renames it Blizzard North.  Blizzard North then produces Diablo, which turns out to be hugely successful.  Blizz North then makes Diablo 2 and the expansion, before beginning work on two more games in the same vein as the Diablo games in 2003.  Just a few months into development of these games, several key members quit, and when the dust settled, 30 of the developers, including all of the higher-ups, had quit Blizzard North to start two independent companies, Flagship and Castaway.  Neither company did particularly well, the most notable contribution being Hellgate: London and Mythos from Flagship.  Finally, in August 2008, Travis Baldree, Max Schaefer, Erich Schaefer and Peter Hu form Runic, in order to sort of ""get the gang back together.""  Many of the devs behind Diablo (including  Matt Uelmen, composer of Diablo's excellent score) and all of the developers of Mythos then joined the Runic team.  Runic wanted to create a Diablo-esque MMO in the Torchlight universe, but needed funding, and so produced Torchlight in a staggeringly short 11-month period.  After this was highly successful, they put the MMO idea on the back burner in favor of Torchlight 2, which is currently in beta, and here we are at the present.

So, **TL;DR Blizzard North makes Diablo 1 and 2, then everyone quits, they try their hands at a couple of companies before getting back together to form their own studio, Runic, which made Torchlight.  Diablo 3 is NOT made by the developers behind Diablos 1 and 2**

    I just got home from workout and I need to take a shower and get some water.  After I get back I plan on starting to hand out the copies of the game.
  
  I wish I could wait a little longer but I have to go out tonight with friends and because the sale only lasts until 5AM my time and I would prefer it be added through steam friends I want to make sure it's a convenient time for others.
  
  See you guys soon!  
  
  Edit - 8:27 PM CST.  Getting the names in a list for a randomizer to choose.
  
  Buying the copies now and putting them into my account.  Steam store is getting hit right now so It's going slow.  Some of you didn't PM me your steam account because you were so excited.  I PMed you letting you know.
  
  Edit - I have 9 copies bought on my account and steam and or my bank has officially started to deny me to buy another copy.  LOL.  Hold on.
  
  Edit - I've put in a support ticket with steam because I'm pretty sure it's them.  Either way I'm going to start adding people and gifting the 9 copies I DO have and If I get back later tonight and I can pickup the 10th before the sale ends I will and give it out to someone for sure.
  
  Edit -- I've sent out all the invites.  When you accept them I will get the games to you.  I'm going out and will be back later tonight.  So don't freak out if I don't get them to you asap.

Recently we've been hit by a couple of sour grapes (which we believe is actually one sour grape). We don't want to martyr the behaviour, so I wont go into too much detail.

The general gist is a user has been downvoting a lot of submissions and comments within our fine subreddit. Many users have felt their posts have been downvoted unfairly, and that is totally true. It is not however the ""average"" Reddit user doing so. 

We don't know why, but we know who is doing it and it's being pursued through head admins. In addition to this abuse of the upvote and downvote system, the user has also been abusing members publicly and moderators privately.

If you see any unsavory content on the subreddit - both now and in the future - (comments, abuse, ""Inboxes"", etc), please report it and we will deal with it promptly. 

Thanks, and keep looting!

There's a lotta stuff in this post, so let's get started!

------------------------------------
**Weekly Loot Threads**

As many of you have noticed, the subreddit is practically flooded with pictures of loot people have found and other inane things. We've received many complaints about this, so we're *testing* [keyword here is *testing*] a weekly loot thread for people to post any and all loot they've found in the game to share. Here's some quick bullets: 

* Threads will be posted every Friday evening starting **Friday, September 28th** and a link will be put in the sidebar.

* Threads will be for showing off loot only. **This includes completed sets, gambles, and legendaries.**

* Any posts showing off loot not in the thread will be deleted and redirected to that week's loot thread.

---------------------------------
**Submission Rules**

I'll give a quick rundown of the submission rules in one post rather than the 3 we have right now.

* No co-op threads or trade threads. Please redirect those to /r/playdate or /r/torchlighttrade.

* All silly content goes into /r/torchlightmemes - this includes memes/reference/pop culture posts.

* Loot goes in loot threads!

* Please try to Google any basic information - like ""how does this skill work"" or ""what does this do"" - before posting a question.

* No circlejerk posts, like ""I'm so happy to be playing TL2 after D3."" 

* Use spoiler tags/spoiler link flair!

* Be nice, be constructive, and be a great member of our community :]

That's about it! If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or ideas for improvement, please feel free to comment and let your voice be heard!

A bunch of my friends who actually never played Diablo now bought Torchlight during the steam sale, and I was wondering is it worth it for me to get it? A few things, I've heard a lot of people say it is a pure Diablo clone, and I'm not sure I want to bother with it if its a copy of a game I already own. Does it really bring enough to the table to be worth $15? On top of that how much better does the game play, if at all, than say Diablo or Torchlight 1. I played Torchlight 1 for a bit, got it in a bundle, but the lack of multiplayer made it pretty dull really fast, so also suppose I should ask how is the community on Torchlight 2? 



Anyways, just looking for your opinions, if the game is worth getting or not. Veteran Diablo players take on the game would be very welcome.


Edit: Thanks for all the opinions guys, really appreciate the feedback, am very impressed with the community here as a whole. Heres hoping Torchlight 2 goes on 50% sale 1 more time this winter sale!

1351450596.0,42,self.Torchlight,128asu,Torchlight II and difficulty: or why higher difficulties discourage dynamic gameplay,kazegami,58,16,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/128asu/torchlight_ii_and_difficulty_or_why_higher/,"So I've started a good number of new characters (elite and veteran) recently, and I'm increasingly noticing how Runic has designed some enemies in such a way that they really damage the gameplay on these higher difficulty levels. This isn't going to be a claim or rant that the higher difficulty levels are ""too hard"" in anyway, but rather I want to talk about how I think the way they are *made* difficult have negatively impacted gameplay (in my opinion).

The major thing I've noticed is that the cooldown time for elite and veteran enemies is incredibly low, and I think is a problem. Two enemies in particular stood out to me: Mordrox, and the sturbeorn frost casters.

In the Mordrox battle, you may have noticed that enemies respawn near instantly after you kill them in order to maintain a hefty supply of units to constantly mill around Mordrox. That's cool and all, but enemies that instantly respawn upon death *completely removes the incentive to kill them*, and I think this is a problem. It becomes a battle where your only choice is just to go directly for Mordrox and attack him incessantly, without any regard to what may be attacking around you, or really anything that is going on in your surroundings, and that kinda sucks.

Similarly, with the sturmbeorn casters, that *fucking whirlwind attack* is a pain in the ass, but what makes it truly terrible is the instant it dissipates it can be immediately recast. So you can go through whatever hoops you want to dodge the attack, but sucks to be you because it's going to be following you again in another millisecond. If you're an engineer or berserker, it's probably easy enough to just walk up to the caster and whack him to death and just soak the damage, but it becomes a realproblem for outlanders and embermages, where the one thing they rely on most is painfully ripped from them (running away).

Both are definitely manageable, however, I don't like the way my options seem to be limited when fighting either. It becomes ""just go up and kill the main guy, there's not much else you can do."" I think the problem is definitely mitigated more for melee characters, and NG+ characters, because in the first case you are expected to be able to soak up damage coming at you from all angles, and in the other, by that time you have a variety of tools that provide buffs and abilities to not really *deal* with it, but I feel more like *circumvent* it entirely (i.e. abilities that pierce through enemies; homing attacks). This may in fact just be an issue related to newly born characters, and maybe that's why it has only recently stood out to me, but I think it points to a larger concern with combat in the game: the enemy relies very heavily on instant cooldowns, instant-adjustment to player position, and homing attacks to give the perception of difficulty, rather than providing a strong cycle of attacks that the player has to consciously decide whether they can soak it up or if they need to avoid it. The topic can be elaborated on substantially from this, but I'll end it here.

After seeing a post a few days ago, about the ability to sell things to vendors, then from the buy back tab, being able to drag the item over the close button, you'd be able to drop the item on the ground.  I decided to go play with the vendors a bit and see what I could find out.

There is a way to know what you can get from the gambler every single time.

Steps to do so.

1. Open the gamblers shop.

2. Drag any item type you're interested in overtop of the buyback tab in the bottom right of the shop menu.

3. When you drop the item onto the buyback tab button, the item will enter the buyback menu, but will be 
identified.

4. When you've dragged an item into the buyback tab and decided that's the item you want.  Simply drag the item off the buyback tab and onto the close button, and drop it onto the ground.

This will work every single time until patched, and you can easily get a full set of gear or uniques for free.

I had to go into a nearby cave and find some general dude that was causing a ruckus for the water guardian living in there.

The fight to the general was interesting. The scenery was detailed and colorful, the mobs weren't too hard (except the fire mages were a bit difficult), and despite being a little low on levels and gear, I managed to push through to the end.

The boss was very large in size, and it took a long time to whittle him down. His attacks were powerful, but slow and choreographed, allowing me to dodge them. He would randomly cause the ceiling to collapse, dealing AOE damage and dropping enemies into the room. These enemies were a mix of ranged and melee, some spawned other mobs, others had shields (which needed to be broken). It was a long drawn out fight, and I chugged a lot of mana potions to keep up my skill bombardment. I even found myself equipping other weapons I picked up earlier in the cave, just to boost my DPS. Eventually I took the guy down, and was rewarded handsomely for doing so.

One of my gripes in Diablo 3 is that all the boss fights suck(except maybe the butcher). Even the Lord of Terror is a dumbed down version from Diablo 2. They took away his best offensive attacks and replaced them with *teleport*. Once I beat normal difficulty and started trudging through act 2 on nightmare (decked out with rares from the AH, like blizzard intended), I simply didn't want to play anymore. The game became shallow and completely boring. Out of all the skills I had unlocked, only 6 of them were worth using, and those skills had only 1-2 useful runes. The solution to every encounter was spamming my nuke ability. Everything on screen would die in 2-3 hits. There was literally no depth to the game, no challenge.

Back to Torchlight. I turned in the General quest and chose an epic mace as my reward. My weapon DPS went from 30 to 140 in that one quest. When I ventured out into the next area, I felt like I was a god, whacking things to death in just one swing. That feeling was short lived, because enemies were still quite capable of kicking my ass, even though I was stronger. I also had to fight more enemies at once. It was a nice balance of things, because I got to feel more powerful while the game also became more challenging.

I'm becoming a Torchlight convert very quickly. There's just so many little things that are noticeable, that give it life. Things like having a customizable pet that can sell your wares while you crawl deeper into a dungeon, or having to use certain abilities to break enemy shields, catching fish in a pond that will turn your pet into random monsters with different effects, or walking up to a little cave and having wolves jump out to attack you, or being able to weapon swap, etc. These are all little things that I've noticed in the first hour of play.

I'm going to pre-order Torchlight 2, and I'm very excited to see what Runic has in store for the game. If I had to choose between a hollow game with Hollywood-level CGI cutscenes, or a game filled with creativity and soul with penny-arcade cartoon illustrations, I would gladly choose the latter. Even though I mistakenly chose the former. &gt;_&lt;

I'm going to try and convert both my friend and girlfriend to this game, and maybe even get them into the beta. My friend is also getting tired of D3, for the same lack of depth.

Here we go. Torchlight 2. 10 days and 3 hours from release. I had wanted to avoid this thread entirely, but I didn't want to wait. So here we go with the most meta post I've ever made: a post commenting on the post that I'll make in three days about how the subreddit about the game is going to change. 

With the release of the game I am planning on opening a couple other subreddits that I am grooming now, and want some input on the changes here before that happens. I'm going to go ahead and list the changes to this sub first, followed by the introductory rules of the new subreddits. None of these changes will go into effect until at least the release of Torchlight 2.

**Changes to /r/torchlight**

My intention is to keep this as the general one. I would like the quality of the posts to stay high, unlike some of the general game subreddits. My proposed changes are:

* No trade threads

* No ""silly content."" By which I mean no image macros, rage comics, reaction gifs, basically anything that would be at home at /r/asongofmemesandrage.

* Implementation of an image post standard much like the one that I instituted over at /r/bindingofisaac. [Here's a link to the post where I discuss them over there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bindingofisaac/comments/ya0c5/new_image_post_standards/)

* No co-op partner searching threads 

**New Subreddits**

&gt;**/r/torchlighttrade**
&gt;
&gt;This will be the general place to organize trades of items. My proposed rules are as follows:

&gt;* Please format your trades as [H] brief item description [W] brief item description. 

&gt;* Images must be included in every post.

&gt;* If you are really uncomfortable with making a trade, message the moderators and we can act as middlemen.

&gt;* If you find a post in violation of the rules, please report it and message the mods. 

[ ](/s)

&gt; **/r/torchlightmemes**

&gt;This will be the catch-all for that silly content I mentioned earlier. Not sure about rules here if there even are any needed.

That's the master plan, everyone. At ten days prior to launch, there is still plenty of time to change it still, hence this post. Tell me how I go too far/don't go far enough below. Also: if anyone has problems with how everything is organized after launch, I have /r/truetorchlight and /r/torchlightloot available for use when they are needed. Go ahead and message me if you think I should be breaking them out. Also: don't forget to give us shoutouts on any other subreddits you frequent. I love the attention and we have some exciting things planned for launch.

They've given us a wonderful product and service to match. Let's write them a thank you letter. I've never done anything like this before so I only have an untested theory on how to make it work. 

1. Everyone says something they want in the letter, 
1. everyone votes, 
1. top 20 posts make it into the letter, 
1. Everyone who submits gets their name at the end of the letter as if they had signed it. If you have nothing to add to what has been said but want to sign submit '**asdf**' and I will add your name to the letter.
1. I format it and sent it to Runic sometime on October first.

If this idea sucks give me a better idea or input on how to make it better. Please PM me suggestions so that the submissions for the letter are not cluttered. I will make changes to the OP with credit to the suggester if desired.

If you want to send runic a screenshot of your character upload it to imgur and I will do what I can to get them organized into some sort of pretty collage without making them indescribable as characters. (a load of cropping will probably be done on my part. Please PM me if there's something in your Screen shot besides your character that you DO NOT WANT CROPPED [ie: pets, dead bosses, npcs, other players, rocks you thought looked cool, ect.])

THIS IS NOT MY PROJECT! I want it to be a letter from all of us and I want it to be nice.

Thanks. :)

EDIT: I will be putting the letter together on the 2nd instead of the 1st because my schedule was changed and I am off tomorrow. Sorry for  the delay.

EDIT2: and it's sent. Noone sent me images but we had a wall of texty gratitude. I'll let you guys know if they reply but I'm good just expressing my thanks.

1355890069.0,37,self.Torchlight,153afs,Things to keep in mind while playing multiplayer with random people,kazegami,45,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/153afs/things_to_keep_in_mind_while_playing_multiplayer/,"I've put about 200 hours into TLII at this point, most of which has been multiplayer with strangers..however, some players aren't as courteous as others and they may not realize it, so here are a few things to keep in mind while playing multiplayer:

* Don't stray too far away from the group. If there are 4 to 6 people in game then it's probably better to avoid a large clusterfuck, but even then, going too far away makes it more confusing for other players. Players usually go where enemies are, and if there are no enemies, it's easy to assume they've already been there when they actually haven't.

* Also, don't get too far ahead. People are in the game to kill stuff and pick up loot. If you're always going far ahead and killing everything  leading up to an exit, what is left for the other players that may be lagging behind a bit or taking their time to explore side-routes? Multiplayer is about sharing the experience.

* Along the same lines, don't go and kill the boss by yourself. Though it's possible to reset boss instances, sometimes things happen and you could end up depriving other players of the experience and loot.

* If you can manage it, wait for all players to be present before finishing off a boss, or even a champion. Sometimes people die, and for whatever ridiculous reason, players may have to go through several load screens before they can get back to where they were. Waiting a bit makes sure they haven't been deprived of XP or loot, especially if it has been a particularly tough fight and they died towards the end of it.

* Don't join games in which you'll be severely over leveled. If your level is much higher than other players' that means you are probably brutally murdering everything. Sometimes this isn't a big deal, but from experience it's more irritating to have a level 60 player come into a game full of level 40's to precede to destroy everything for us. Some people may be okay with that, but most of the time it's not cool to make other people chase after you while you kill stuff.

* Be considerate when joining a game in which you are under-leveled. If you're dying a lot, you may be making people wait for you a lot, too. Also, other players may not be as eager to go back and do quests that you may be behind on. However, most players are totally okay with this in my experience.

* I really recommend not joining games if your character is a low-level but wearing extremely high-level armor and using high-level weapons.. It's irritating in a very similar way to high-level players joining low-level games. It's also sometimes very suspicious....

* Obviously modded clients and cheated gear or whatever will also make your fellow players uncomfortable, but that's a given. Though some people will probably appreciate you donating 100000000000 of your cheated gold to them, they might feel a bit bummed when they realize they don't have to care about money any more.

Just some things to keep in mind. My overall experience with other people has been positive, with the obnoxious modders who insist on showing off being my only real problem.

I'm cool with that. Once modders get their hands on the toolkit and want to make PvP, it will be up to them to balance it however they see fit.

That said, **what do you think is the most OP skill you've used or seen??**

My nominations:

Offense - Glaive Throw (Outlander)

This is the default starting skill for outlander. At tier 2+ the skill hits 6+ targets and aims all by itself. I can just aim somewhere in the middle of the screen, hold RMB and everything dies in about the time my mana disappears. It charges my bar every enemy it hits which means my bar is full after one or two packs of mobs. At level 30, I was doing 1200-2000 per enemy per hit on critical. It also slows and interrupts any mobs I didn't 1 hit. Did I mention no cast time? 

Defensive - Frost Phase (Embermage)

This is essentially like the D3 wizard teleportation without the pesky cooldown and can freeze/knockback. I generally don't like the idea of glass cannons because I'm not very nimble when it comes to kiting and attacking, but virtually unlimited teleport makes surviving pretty easy. Any death with this skill equipped means you weren't paying attention or got greedy. This also makes traveling a long distance a much quicker process.

Within the mines, an ancient, fell demon awoke.  Ordrak drew human servitors to him, desperate for the power he promised.

After he fell, his heart - still beating with venomous life - corrupted another.  Slaying his one-time allies and laying waste to Torchlight, the Alchemist set himself a quest to rid the world of all Ember, and thus, all Emberblight, including his own affliction - but destroying all magic as well.

In response, the Empire sends its Vanquishers - loyal and elite troops - to stem the tide against their allies, and forestall a war upon their shores.  Their General - known only as the Destroyer^1 - has suffered a serious injury at the hands of the Alchemist, and has only a single warrior to send forth to halt the coming nightmare.

To enable him to achieve his goals, the Alchemist needs ever more power.  He passes through the Estherian Enclave, spreading illness in his wake - a fey sickness that transforms those who succumb to it, into thralls of the Netherim.

Unbeknownst to the Alchemist, the Netherim are using his disrputive acts to spread their influence into our world.  As the Alchemist drains the power from the Guardian of Water, their influence spreads further.

In addition, an opportunistic Sturmbeorn, General Grell, takes advantage of the chaos of the Alchemist's passing to ransack the Guardian's Temple and seize much of the surrounding countryside.  Vale, the Commander of the Emperor's Vanquishers, is taken prisoner as well.

Leaving the Guardian of Water, the Alchemist advances on the Watchweald Temple and drains the Guardian of the Wyld.  The Guardian and Grant Regent Eldrayn, weakened by their struggles against the fell sorcerer, are possessed by Nether-Beasts.

Among the Alchemist's incidental allies are the Mirka, potent savants of the frigid tundra, the Goblin King Pogg, and the Blackguard Slavers.  The Goblins and Blackguards hold the keys to enter the Watchweald Temple, while the Mirka are simply content to make life an unmatched pain in the ass.

The Nether-Beasts, Kings of the Netherim, empower their servants far beyond what the Alchemist's influence alone could, and they establish a beach head within our realm to summon their servitors.

The range and damage boost you get from Long Range Mastery makes the wands crazy deadly, and with the Master of the Elements skill and a high focus stat, you'll be putting out incredible amounts of damage.

I like builds that focus only on a few specific skills with tons of passives to back them up, and this fits the bill. You have great survivability due to easy kiting, you'll be churning out ludicrous damage, you can deal with crowds or single targets easily, and with the right tank pet (crabs, always crabs, crabs for life) you can deal with literally any problem the game throws at you.

Seriously give the build a shot, it's a really fun twist on the gunslinger class and provides a unique playstyle with some really neat effects.

I was surprised reading a thread about phase beasts earlier I decided to post this little tid-bit to help everyone out.  

1.)Find a phase beast portal (preferably in the frosted hills or ossean wastes as these phases are easy with around 10k gold each time)

2.)Enter the phase and finish the task but do not leave the phase once you finish.

3.)Log out to loading screen and Log back in.  You will notice you are still in the phase and the phase has reset.

You keep the gold/ items from the previous phases and can do this indefinitely till you die of boredom.

For example, this may just be a bad case of the dumb hitting me, but I leveled from 1 to 7 last night without realizing that I was for the most part only using the auto-attack and not the skill I put points in.

Can anyone point me to resources online or whatever that can break down the basics?

Also, I want to make a Zerker Stormclaw Dual-Wielding bad-ass. I haven't assigned any stat points yet, because I don't really know what would work well with my Stormclaw idea. I've also been hesitant to assign skill points, because of my lack of knowledge about how stats affect skills and whatnot. Any suggestions?

I've almost never lost a weapon gamble because of this. I've mentioned this before, but I'll say it again because I think it's very helpful. Going for items whose requirements you don't meet is a very good strategy. Just be aware of class restrictions on armor, so it might be better to stick to weapons.~~

1368824786.0,30,self.Torchlight,1ejhl7,The Legit and Boring Gold Farming Guide,Cassirer,38,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/1ejhl7/the_legit_and_boring_gold_farming_guide/,"So if you feel guilty exploiting the phase beast portal reset trick to get lots of gold, here’s a more traditional way to get lots of money. Thankfully, it’s not too hard.

This is assuming you’re at least level 50 and have beaten the game once. 

Go to mapworks, and start buying up all the Ezrohir type maps (ignore the Deserted Foundry ones which use the same icon at the vendor), though Bloody Catacomb type maps are your plan B. Reasons for this:

* Ezrohir maps spawn lots of little enemies that make for easy kills. Flying copters, wall scarabs, etc. Make sure you have adequate fire and shock armor.

* Lots of secret rooms and lots of golden chests. The Catacomb maps have similarly a large number of secret rooms, but not as many golden chests. (stuff like [this]( http://imgur.com/ZuceXDl) right before the boss battle is an added bonus)

* Try to buy maps that are 5-10 levels lower than your character level. Gold drops aren’t heavily level dependant, and you want quick kills (unless you prefer the challenge). Obviously, give preference to the ones that drop +25% gold as a map setting if possible.

Now, basically kill stuff, that’s it.

Things that help:

* Lucky Coins (they range from +1~6%, you want the higher end ones obviously). Jurick the Socketer enchanter spawns about 25% of the time on any of the Frosthorn type maps in mapworks, pay him to max out sockets on the armor you plan to use for farming, it’s worth it.

* Demoza Skull (+6% gold found)

* Treasure Hunter (spell)

* Barter (spell)

* Filip the Lucky (enchant+disenchant until you get +% gold drops if you have the money, repeat for critical enchants if you really have the money)

Things that **REALLY** help:

* Argonaut armor pieces

* Nephanic Skull (+20% gold found!)

* Anything else that gives high +%Gold drops (e.g. The Triskelion Fragment, Precision Manumorphic Gloves, Tarroch's Helm, Blatand, Rohac's Comic Boots, etc)

My gold farming engineer runs Argonaut+Celestial Armor pieces with 2 sockets blinged out with Nephanic skulls and Loaded- er Lucky Coins, you can easily make 40k per floor just slaughtering enemies as usual and having your pet sell the excess. (That’s about 80k profit per mapworks scroll)

Even if it’s not a secret room, your average scene of slaughter should look like [this]( http://imgur.com/5GNiaIp).

Other tips if you’re scraping the bottom of the barrel for enchanter fees:

* Sell everything. Those potions taking up slots in your pack which you rarely use? Sell them in bulk. A x99 stack of Ultimate Potions goes for around 6k. Rare loot which other characters might be able to use it? Cash it, they’ll find their own stuff sooner or later.

* Destroy all pots and urns and root through everything on the map. A surprising number of barrels or rocks will drop a bucketload of gold into your face because someone obviously stashed their life savings there before dying (what else would all those Dead Adventurers do before kicking it?), make use of it for them!

* If you die, *do not ever revive*, go to town! The fees are never worth it, particularly as you accumulate more gold, and you shouldn't be under any particular time constraints. 

* Finally, remember to have fun! Farming and grinding can make any game dull very quickly, so throw in as much variety as you can on the quest to glorious efficiency.

And then we have mobs that have little tooltips that give a bit of info about them, ie cannot be interrupted or does such and such an attack.  Why don't any of them say they're resistant to stun or anything?

I'm entirely fine with a lack of information, but I very much dislike inconsistent and inaccurate information.  I enjoyed figuring out for myself in D2 that skeletons and other ""fleshless"" enemies do not confer life leech, but it was also extremely intuitive that all weapon skills did confer all weapon properties, and generally functioned off of attack speed instead of cast.

In a game that is going against a genre defining system of intuitive rules to a more complicated system with nonintuitive rules, functions, and etc.

I'd be fine with a system of symbols that indicated these things, \ confers health leech, / mana, X both, @ applies weapon effects # applies shred only, ! doesn't generate charge, % scaled crit.  

Whatever, I don't need paragraphs outlining things, but indicators would be so much appreciated, especially to reflect bugged state (and a patch to add single symbols to text files could be done by a hobo with ctrl+f in the code and follow some notes printed off on a piece of paper and add in the stuff in the descriptions.",,False,self,t5_2rb10,False,,,True,t3_124vpx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/124vpx/would_anyone_else_really_appreciate_all_tooltips/,

**/r/&lt;Act&gt;\_&lt;Your Name&gt;**  
**/r/MW\_&lt;Map Level&gt;\_&lt;Your Name&gt;**

Use ""2.0"" for just starting Act 2 or ""2.5"" for being half way through Act 2.

Include your name so that people who have played with you before can find your game again and join you for more adventures!

Games are automatically sorted by the NG level of your character so including that was redundant and has been removed per Erichilles' suggestion.

So, an example game where I just started Act 3 would be:

**/r/3.0_NeoSatus**

Or if I was doing level 105 map runs:

**/r/MW_105_NeoSatus**

If you search for /r/, you should get all games matching this format and pick appropriately. You can also search for /r/2.5 to find only games half way through Act 2.

The goal is simple: beat the game on Elite difficulty in a group of 2-4 players using characters dedicated only to this cause. I'd like to play a Tankgineer, but am open to other classes based on what respondents are interested in.

We ~~currently have 3 of 4 spots filled.~~ are currently full, with the following roster:

Engineer (tank)

Outlander

Outlander

Embermage


Looking for availability on Tuesday and Wednesday from about 20:00 GMT-5 until 01:00 GMT-5. Those times aren't concrete. We are going week-by-week on weekend availability.



The rules:


-No console use (we can talk about muling respec potions as a group

~~-One player/class~~

-No shared stash TO your character, but if you find some stuff you want to pass to other characters, that's fine. I'd like this to be a self-found run only.

-Have a microphone and the ability to participate in Steam VOIP or Skype conversations, this is necessary for maximum teamwork and fun times

-Be nice and respectful

-Play as a team

-Have tons of fun


If anyone is interested, leave a reply here with your timezone and desired class. I'm in GMT-5 timezone, so keep that in mind as I mostly play weeknights after 19:00 GMT-5 or weekends at varying times.

Cheers!

Edit: We're currently full.

I think this is a pretty solid build, please critique it and give feedback.

This build is based on being level 42+. Yes I've used respec potions and will continue to do so. Leveling into this build is a lot harder. After 42+ it gets a LOT easier. My advice is to use whatever kills the fastest up until that point, and respec into this if you want to try it.

Also note that this is based off a final min/max build, meaning yes I will use a respec potion in the future to get rid of skills that i dont think are necessary, but required now that theres no respec.

***Ending build explanation: (skills)***

*Blitz Skill Tree:*

**Emberquake**: 15/15 points - Great skill that hits multiple mobs, as well as can do multiple hits on single target mobs and bosses.  Works really well with shield bash, where you shield bash into large groups, and emberquake in the middle.  KEEPING THIS UP AT LATER LEVELS REQUIRES A LOT OF MANA POTS!!!!!  I cannot stress that last part enough :P  Its rough, but to me worth it.

**Onslaught**: 15/15 points - Replacement for shield bash.  Very accurate movement and amazing debuff.  Onslaught into a group and emberquake them to death!

**Ember Hammer**: 1/15 points - Must have skill.  Those annoying enemies later on with shields?  One hit with this breaks them and makes for easy kills.  Has a large hit area, and is an easy grab.

*Construction Skill Tree:*

**Healing Bot**: 15/15 points - the skill name says it all.  The little bot follows you around, heals, and regens mana within a certain area.  Excellent for group play.  Also get a nice armor boost at tier 3.

**Bulwark**: 15/15 points - required for anyone going tank build.  the skill adds armor and gives great damage reduction.

**Fire and Spark**: 15/15 points - adds fire damage which only buffs your emberquake.  must have.

**Charge Domination**: 6/15 points - this is really just one of those moments where I don't know where to put my final few points.  It makes it kind of annoying that the skill points don't even out.  But this should give roughly a 5% chance when an enemy is killed to fully fill your charge up.  Awesome if it works, but with this build you wont really notice when it doesnt.

*Aegis Skill Tree*:

**Forcefield**: 15/15 points - this skill will help keep you in god mode if you keep this up and have Aegis of Fate constantly going off.  Also shields allies which helps the squishier classes.

**Immobilization Copter**: 5/15 points - this is an amazing skill.  it follows you around slowing targets.  With five points in this, this just helps with those champion mobs and bosses really.  its great to have and i recommend nobody skip it.

**Aegis of Fate**: - 15/15 points - AMAZING skill.  this plus forcefield are pretty much god mode.  when you shield bash into 10+ enemies the chances of this going off at 15% are very high, and you will constantly see ""absorbed"" spammed on your screen from enemy hits.

**Charge of Reconstitution**: 15/15 points - heals anyone?  the great thing about this is, if you get low, and cast forcefield, forcefield protects you from further damage, while this heals your missing life.  this is why i love to have forcefield as the only charge skill.  both work amazing together.

-------------------------------------------------------

Common skill questions from comments:

**Why not use Flame Hammer instead of Emberquake?**

*When testing, I ran into a few issues.  Let me make sure people know this is based on my play style, and what seemed to be more effective.  Flame Hammer is a great skill, but when testing it I saw a few issues.  Flame Hammer does a couple things I dont like.  First off the way it hits the ground, and projectiles go searching for enemies.  It doesnt track nearly as well as emberquake, and doesnt put off nearly as many splinters as emberquake does.  Now Flame Hammer has a chance to do two additional blasts if it uses a charge.  The issue with this is, the actual additional blasts get pushed out too far in front of you, and again just dont track enemies well.  I don't see it hitting nearly as hard as emberquake, and another downside is it actually uses charges.

**Why not use sword and board?**

*I simply see it as this.  If I have a shield with 200 armor.  Max sword and board gives you 90% of that armor to weapon DPS.  So that adds 190 weapon DPS for 15 skill points of mine.  That doesnt give me nearly enough.  If you are going for max DPS over being able to survive, you will run into issues.  Testing max DPS and seeing people spec'd into max DPS while in a normal difficulty game with a full party of six, they were dropping like flies.  The game can get very hard, you want to survive.*

**Stats**:

Honestly theres very little to say here.  You will want to do your stats based on needed gear.  you wont need higher level vitality for higher level armor until level 30+, at that point start to really invest in vitality with strength over 100.  this build is very protected by forcefield and aegis even at lower levels.

I will say that you will possibly want to invest a little bit into focus for mana, maybe 50 points max.  shield bash is very spammable and emberquake takes up a lot of mana.  so if you dont constantly chugging mana pots, then take some focus a little later.  thats of course if your current gear doesnt provide.

**Gear**:

You will be looking for +fire damage gear, and as high armor as you can get.  your shield needs very high armor for shield bash damage.  I'm still debating on whether or not a slow weapon for higher damage is better, or a faster weapon with lower damage is better.  since shield bash is dependent on your weapon speed, ive always used a fast weapon to spam it as much as possible.  maybe having both available is good.

One thing I noticed, is get weapons with the highest flat weapon dps.  not elemental damage, highest absolute weapon dps.  you will see drastic changes in your actual emberquake damage.

In general I look for armor that has a few main attributes.  Highest armor value &gt; life &gt; fire dmg % &gt; weapon dmg %.

Socketing the gems that give 3% Damage reduction in your armor can amount to an easy 30% extra DR, if not more, with just 10 armor sockets filled up.  Will test when I find enough to have that much :P

**Pet**:

Please don't forget to utilize your pet.  put him as straight DPS.  when you get spell scrolls, your pet becomes a absolute monster with the right fish.  honestly mine was doing more DPS than me up to level 40, and still does with the right fish.  Adrenaline + haste + other scrolls = AMAZING.  set to aggressive as well, not defensive.

After you start to do more DPS than your pet, you wont to set it up with spells that benefit you and the group.  things such as heal all, barter, treasure hunter, etc. ( i believe treasure hunter spell works on pet? )

**Update 1**: added pet info.

**Update 2**: updated with new confirmed max skill points of 132.  added new information on why this skill over that in regards to comment feedback.  tested using respec potions in game @ level 55+ versus level 75+ maps, normal difficulty with max party. (which is very hard).  Added screenshots of my current character sheet + skill panes

**Update 3**:  Changing shield bash for onslaught.  Shield bash seems to be bugged, and just turns out later is much harder to hit with, doesnt seem to apply attack speed debuff either?  at least no debuff icon appears on mobs.

**Update 4**:  Added new leveling info.  TL;DR use respec potions at level 42 :)

Hope you like it, please let me know if you have any questions and feedback is greatly appreciated!

I play Synergies and use such mods as Extra Chunky and Zoomy and so on. Now continuing...

I think TL2 is one of the best games to come out in a while, especially having come from Diablo 3, which I thought failed the franchise, and having played Diablo II thousands of hours. The community is certainly not to the masses that D2 was, but I do remember for a period TL2 was getting more attention that D3. And it seems now it is dying down a bit. Certainly plenty of people still play with friends. I do, but I still miss being able to join a game easily.

And why? Because to join a modded game as a person who plays with mods I need to sort through that giant INCONVENIENT drop down menu list of mod configurations. 90% of which are synergies mod servers! Almost half the time of which for some reason wont even show up in the list when i try to find the single server with that specific mod configuration, and that's not even taking into consideration they might be level 75 and I'm level 20 or vice versa. See the incredible headache you guys have made Runic? I will say the little amount of functionality you put in for the server browser is appreciated but it needs to be polished! But it isn't, and because of this I feel NO ONE wants to join an internet server. At least not one that isn't their friend playing. I remember before workshop I very often joined a public game. Even with Synergies. Not anymore. Its next to impossible, and always time consuming to find. And I even tried  making a vanilla character but alas, it seems almost everyone plays with mods. I can only find a few vanilla games.

TL2 NEEDS a new server browser. I feel they should just have a simple check box, or just call different lists for modded saves and normal saves. MODS or NO MODS. It already lets you restart and download the needed mods? So why not just have the giant list of modded servers, and a list for normal. It would be so much easier and i really feel it would help the online TL2 community a bit. Heck, maybe even a lot. So dev's if you see this PLEASE PLEASE take into consideration! I love your game and I want to see it live on and prosper in the online community! And if players agree please please upvote! Or repost this idea on Runic's forums! Or anywhere else!

I played almost everything in Singleplayer without respec or anything like that. I play an Embermage with almost every point in the [fire tree](http://i.imgur.com/NpH9a.jpg). 

First of all, I really enjoyed the game so far. The pace of the game is nice, the dynamic and the atmosphere all works really well for me. But there are also a few flaws. As an Embermage I need to kite, but sadly you can't kite really well in TL2. I don't know why, but moving between casts always feels like a gamble. I can't control my char as I want to which cost me a few of my deaths.

The amount of Rares is high enough for me, I was a bit unlucky with tho. I found a ridiculously high amount of rares for the engineer and the berserker, leaving me with level 50 Boots on level 90. But everything was manageable. 

I loved collecting the sets tho. I got a full Blue Set and I'm now working on Emberweave and Winters Reach. I don't know if I will wear them when I complete them, as I really like my Equip as it is at the moment. But I will for sure test out the bonuses once I finished them. 

I sadly didn't found a Legendary yet. I know they are supposed to be really rare, but in 80 hours of gaming at least one would have been nice. Maybe I will be more lucky in the Mapworks.

The Embermage itself is an awesome character in my opinion. There was only one Skill in the skilltree which I regretted skilling. Firebombs just didn't work for me and I threw them out of the rotation. I won't do the same mistake with my next Embermage which I'll try to focus on Dex. 

I won't try to compare the game to Diablo 3, both games were fun playing for me and everybody should enjoy what he likes the most. overall TL2 was and is a great experience. 

On a side note. I hate it that Immolation Aura turns off when you enter a new zone and I hate it that you can't take the quest with the robot parts with you through game modes. Why isn't that possible?

* The ""+X% improvement in vendor prices"" effects found on weapons and armor **do** affect the sale price when your pet goes to town.  (Haven't tested whether it affects the price when you pet buys stuff for you...)

* The effect applies at the point of sale, i.e. when your pet **returns,** or when you **meet it in town**.  This means you could keep a piece of equipment with a bunch of ""+X% improvement in vendor prices"" effects in your inventory, and keep an eye on your pet's timer while its on the way to town to sell junk.  When it's almost back, just equip it before it returns, then swap back to your combat gear.

1357446339.0,27,self.Torchlight,161m8j,[mod] Like hoarding loot? Check out these shared stash mods.,yParticle,28,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/161m8j/mod_like_hoarding_loot_check_out_these_shared/,"Coming to you courtesy of our gamer friends in ~~Korea~~ China:

The [**Super Shared Stash**](http://bbs.3dmgame.com/forum.php?mod=attachment&amp;aid=MjIyMDI3MnxjMzY2NDc1M3wxMzU3NDQwNjgwfDB8MzUyMDUyNg%3D%3D) increases each tab of your shared stash from 5 to 125 rows, giving all of your characters easy access to 1000 slots for organizing loot.  It does this by utilizing all of the vertical space when the shared stash is open and adding a scrollbar.  [**Source with screenshots.**](http://bbs.3dmgame.com/thread-3520526-1-2.html)

The [**itemSlot**](http://pan.baidu.com/share/link?shareid=86592&amp;uk=2198009541) mod quadruples all of your inventory space by shrinking the icons to a quarter of their standard size.  This lets you store four times as much in the same space across all of your inventories, at the cost of rendering smaller, less detailed icons which also takes a performance hit.  For some reason, the smaller grid on the inventory side only displays when moving items around.

Finally, the [**Big Shared Stash**](http://bbs.3dmgame.com/forum.php?mod=attachment&amp;aid=MjIyNzM3OHw5NzZmNTJhYXwxMzU3NDQwNzMxfDB8MzUzMDI1MQ%3D%3D) combines the two mods above, giving you a crazy 4000-slot shared stash as well as quadrupling your other inventories.  Rendering and resizing so many items caused a noticeable performance hit on my system, but it was pretty cool to see so many items crammed on one screen. [**Source with screenshots.**](http://bbs.3dmgame.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=3530251)

*Compatibility note: You can upgrade from an unmodified stash to the Super Shared Stash or itemSlot without losing anything, and from either of those to the Big Shared Stash without losing anything.  Going backward will lose you any items that no longer fit.  Back up your save folder before playing with any of these!*

After testing them all, I really prefer the first since it feels fast and clean, but a die-hard collector might like the option to have so much extra on-screen space to organize everything.

**UPDATE: I've converted the Super Shared Stash to GUTS and bumped it up from 1000 slots to 1600.

Hey guys! First let me say **THANK YOU** for your enormous response to my thread Tuesday night. I honestly did not expect such a big turnout, and it was really cool to see creative and thoughtful submissions. Let me just add that there were a ton of really great things submitted, and believe me, it was beyond stressful just choosing four of each one. So! **I decided to buy another 4 pack, making the total number of copies 16!** With that said, here are the winners (please message me your Steam ID):

Thank you everyone for participating! Most of all, those of you who participated in the Life Advice contest... Just know that my kids read ALL of your submissions (yes, all of them). They were able to pick their favorite and write about it, so while you may not have won a copy of Torchlight 2, I hope you know that you still impacted a kid in a meaningful way. To do something for me, that's great. But to do something for my kids -- thank you seems small. Regardless, a huge THANK YOU again for your submissions.

I bought Torchlight 2 on the first day of the release and played it like 80 hours or so.

After all I really enjoyed the game and really liked the playstyle, artstyle and all that stuff.

I know that the game is not supposed to entertain one for ages but still I wanted to know if you guys have something in mind that could maybe get me to play again?

You do not need Internet in order to play it and you can choose to play in a LAN if you want. I see a lot of new folks around here so I just wanted to share a couple of pointers.

1) Torchlight 1 is cheap, and it's good. It doesn't have MP but it's still a good game with three different classes.

2) Torchlight II is really fun but some people are disappointed because it might become a little bit to repetitive at the later levels, to prevent this I think you should play on ELITE difficulty. There's not a big deal if you die, but it's way more fun to actually have to be aware of your surroundings.

3) You can always MOD the game, but I suggest that you play the original through at least to NG+ (new game with harder mobs) since they've added some more additional content in the latest patch.

4) There's no respecc system without ""cheats"" or MODS, the closest thing you get is to revert the last three points that you've spent. So chose wisely, but it's not the end of the world if you mess up.

5) A lot of classes can have an insane amount of different builds, give them a try if you feel like it.

6) Disregard everything I've told you and play it as you want. I've been playing this almost weekly since Torchlight 1 so I have my ways set in stone. Some might dislike the fact that you're ""cheating"" with mods, others love it. Find your own playstyle and have fun. The game has a lot of bugs and exploits, it's up to you if you (mis)use them or not.",,False,self,t5_2rb10,False,,alchemist,True,t3_1bqshd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/1bqshd/a_tip_for_some_new_players_out_there/,

I, and all of the mods, hope you had an incredible holiday season and got plenty of sweet drops (both in real life and our beloved ARPG).

When we launched the /r/torchlight subreddit we created specific ""threads"" for people to look for co-op partners or leveling friends. In light of the game's release we've decided to allow people to post threads in this subreddit looking for co-op partners.

The only request is you preface them all with [COOP] and a short summary of your level/difficulty, etc. For example, ""[COOP] 49 Embermage on Normal"" or something similar.

1. Pace.  TL1 seems a bit sluggish compared to D3.  Both the movement and combat were a bit too slow.  Is TL2's pace a bit faster than TL1?

2. Voice Acting.  TL1 voice acting sounded like someone recorded it in their garage.  Is this a bit better in TL2?

3. Overall Presentation Quality.  Is a bit better in D3 than TL1.  How's TL2's?

The Grand Regent, the Artificer, Grom the so-called ""Murderer"" - all who stood before him fell into ashes.

Thrash focused his mind, pulling the elements into him.  His blood hummed as he unleashed the full force of his fury on the unaware brute.

Pillars of fire erupted, closing on the Troll like bloodhounds; gouts of pure magma leapt from his fingers.  The flames burrowed hungrily into the beast's skin, searing it from within.

The Troll was not idle - its axe, larger than Thrash, cut deeply into the Embermage.  Thrash paid it no mind; he'd survived far worse.  The Troll wavered, but scored deeply into Thrash once more.  

The Embermage turned to run, his fingers fumbling for a potion flask, as the axe descended again; an inexorable judgement against the human's arrogance at standing against it.  Like a thunderbolt from the Gods of Old, the rotted blade cast Thrash into fetid ground of the swamp.

1349266350.0,21,self.Torchlight,10vczr,Does anybody else feel like the skill and class design is by far the weakest point of this game?,,55,34,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10vczr/does_anybody_else_feel_like_the_skill_and_class/,"... which is a shame because almost anything else is so good.

My biggest problem with this game is more of a general thing but still related to the skills. It's the god damn spell animations. This game is so fast paced. *Why can't I animation-cancel*. *Why does every animation have to take two years to finish*. It just makes the skills feel not very fun to use and feels so out of place compared to the pace of the game. The rest of the combat is actually pretty fluid but the animations make it feel so awful.

Next up is the actual skills. Even disregarding the spell animations, the skills don't feel very satisfying to use. D3 classes have a bunch of problems but the skills feel **so** much better to use. D3 has a bunch of underpowered skills which can be fixed by tweaking the numbers, but half of TL2's skills just feel useless because they are fundamentally flawed. Again, I think a lot of this is done to the awful spell animations and the fact that skills in this game have *very* low range. You can't even see the mobs until you are pretty much right in their face.

Then we get to the overall class design. I could spend a lot of time picking this apart but I think that if you've played a lot of other RPG's before, you'll probably realize that the overall class design in this game isn't very good. The basic idea behind their stat/skill system is actually very decent. It's just that the actual skills and passives aren't designed very well.

A good example would be the Embermage. 2 out of 9 passives are downright useless unless you use one of the base spells (out of which only Prismatic Bolt is really good) which scale of weapon DPS. To a new player this will never be apparent and he'll probably spend a bunch of points into mostly useless passives. That's just not good game design.

Another example would be the Outlander. This is a more subjective opinion but it really feels like a failed experiment between a hunter and a mage. Autoattacking, especially with guns feels very satisfying yet there are next to no skills that actually use and interact with the weapon you use. Instead, one of the best Outlander skills makes you throw a glaive. Why do I even have an awesome shotgun if all I'm going to do is throw glaives at people?

Ok I've been ranting on for way too long. But hopefully you get the point I'm trying to make.

**TL;DR: The spell animations in this game are awful. The skills don't feel very satisfying to use. The overall class design isn't done very well. Don't get wrong though I want this game to be good. The rest of it is bloody awesome. I just can't enjoy a game when my character doesn't feel satisfying to use.**",,False,self,t5_2rb10,1349266710.0,,,True,t3_10vczr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10vczr/does_anybody_else_feel_like_the_skill_and_class/,

To me this is pretty big, but knowing there could be some side affects and problems along with it (Such as being able to cheat easier) I could see why it'd be difficult to incorporate into the game. 

* **Timers on summoned units, or some indication of whether they're up or not.** This bugs me quite a bit, as I have a Engineer and also tried out the new Necromancer with the synergies mod, it's quite difficult to tell if you need to refresh your summons again and it's wasted a lot of mana at times.

[Torchlight 2 Render Distance],akaanalrapist,22,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10dhc2/if_a_tree_falls_in_the_forest_torchlight_2_render/,"On single player, it appears that when an enemy is off screen from you, time stops for them.  This means that if you stun an enemy and walk enough away that he doesn't render anymore (1.5 screens is generally enough), your cooldowns reset and when you re-engage the enemy is still stunned.  Same with DoT effects -- monsters don't tick down when they're not on screen.

The downside to this, though, is that on huge monsters you often waste shots into the darkness or get screwed for other reasons.  For example, in Act 2 there is a boss with a gigantic rock golem that summons walls of rock everywhere.  The rocks are timed to disappear in X seconds.  But if you're kiting the boss around, the rocks he spawned way back when don't despawn.  So when you have to turn around, you'll run into tons of rocks that still have their full duration on them even though they've been on the ground for minutes.  On the same boss, even shooting long range shots is difficult -- with Blast Cannon, I found that I had to come significantly closer than max range in order for my shots to hit.  The boss would leave render range otherwise, and just sit there until I walked a bit closer to him.  I believe this is because the game only renders a monster if his entire frame is within render distance, and for humongous monsters like the rock golem that range is quite small.

I wonder if this is the same for multiplayer -- I would assume not, but I'm not sure.  Potentially it works the same with the exception that the true render distance is the union of every player's render distances.  Potentially this could lead to some strategies of de-rendering adds or something similar.  I remember on Grell there were certainly times when the blue wavey energy shooters wouldn't aggro me because they spawn at the corners of the arena, outside of render distance.  There was also a boss in Act 2 (the one right before Luminous Arena) that had two boss-adds -- as I was kiting the main boss, the two boss-adds (unintentionally) de-rendered and I ended up soloing the main boss without any issues.

Anyone have thoughts on this?

There are a few new things, and I'd like to at least touch on those. I think I did a pretty good job on it last time, but if you guys have any questions/concerns/suggestions I am happy to address them.

First things first: Co-op partner threads. I'd thought that Torchlight 2 was going to be Streamworks for whatever reason (probably Borderlands 2 on the mind) and that led to my decision of using the Steam group for looking for groups. It turns out it doesn't use Steamworks, so I'm modifying that slightly. We will have a main LFG thread, a new one every week to keep the popularity up. For best results in there, sort to new. I'll probably post the first one later today, so if anyone needs to get the jump on that they can. 

Second: I've implemented [spoiler tags](/spoiler ""Not actually a ""). Use these often. I'll be removing any improperly marked posts I see. There is also link flair for the threads. When you submit a post, you can click on flair and you get the option to choose the spoiler flair. I'll do the best I can to remove any spoilers that aren't marked, but between Torchlight 2 and Borderlands 2 *(come on Runic!)* I won't be as quick as I could normally be. If you come across a spoiler that isn't marked, report it. It'll be a lot quicker to just remove them all in my modqueue than search through every thread. 

Speaking of Runic employees making terrible mistakes: we have four resident runic employees that you may have seen. They are clearly distinguishable by the big Runic and Runic emblem by their names. If you can't see the Runic emblems, the users are /u/jedifreeman, /u/greg_runic, /u/bellawonder, and /u/devjustinian. 

Finally: a little generic troubleshooting. If you can't see spoiler tags, spoiler link flair, or Runic tags, turn on your subreddit styles! If you have RES it will be above the unsubscribe button, if you don't you'll have to go into your preferences and allow subreddit styles.

r/torchlighttrade seems to be pretty dead so I thought we might try doing a consolidated trading thread here that we would change every week.  That way we've got way more visibility and hopefully more people getting the things that they need.  A few quick things:

No one can know if your items are legitimate or not, but we're trusting everyone here to only offer legitimate items up for trade.

Don't spam this post with the same listing again and again.

If you find a trader who is fast easy and dependable feel free to respond to your thread with positive feedback so we get a list of trustworthy players.

Other than that, have fun, and happy trading!

EDIT:  Thanks to a brilliantly simple suggestion from iisten if possible, please remember to take a screenshot of your legendary item on the ground and unidentified before picking it up.  Although minor this will be a helpful step toward insuring the legitimacy of the items being exchanged.  Also, just don't be an asshole.

3. Should we allow posts made to show off single items?

4. Should we allow looking for co-op partner threads?

5. Does anyone want to be a mod? If yes message me with your qualifications and stuff. Do it quickly and you may get it this weekend, as I have to leave my computer for labor day.

Diablo 3 has been stale for a long time, and will continue to be up to after Blizzcon in November. They are revamping the Loot System.

Torchlight 2 should be Diablo 3's model for itemization. Itemization is so deep and there's a lot of things you can do with your items. I LOVE the Items Meta Game!

e.g. I got a Level 17 Unique Polearm with 1 socket. Would you believe that this Polearm has been very useful to me up to Level 36? I love the ability to enchant the items with additional affixes!

Wow I can't believe Diablo 3 doesn't have this feature. There was supposed to be an Enchantress NPC in D3 that is supposed to give additional item affixes, but they decided to pull it out. Maybe reserving it for expansion? Then I heard they will bring her back in Loot 2.

1. I LOVE the vast maps of Torchlight.

2. I LOVE that the maps are NOT ONLY have RANDOMIZED PATHS, but also there are MANY KINDS OF MAP PARTS BEING RANDOMIZED. I don't notice much repetition in the map, unlike Diablo 3.

3. I LOVE the itemization system.

4. I LOVE the Music. Matt Uelmen is the most epic atmospheric music composer in the history of gaming.

5. I LOVE the Combat System, Pets, Scrolls Skills, Sockets, Recipes.

The single best pieces of advice I have found so far though are that:

* Forcefield + Healbot are basically mandatory for all Engineers regardless of spec.

* You should put at least 1 point in:
Storm Burst, Coup de Grace, Bulwark, Charge Domination in pretty much every spec. 1 point in Ember Hammer if you're using a melee weapon to destroy shields.

Where I don't really know what to do any more is after that. Sword and Board I am told is not really a great skill, especially if you're planning to max Shield Bash and Fire Bash since they ignore your weapon DPS stats completely and rely entirely on Focus for damage.

However, say you are using a shield and ignore those? What if you go Flame Hammer 15/15 for main dps output? Then Sword and Board boosts your Flame Hammer because it is weapon focused.

I noticed Emberquake (best offense skill I guess?) has a weapon DPS component, but it starts out at only 35%. Is Emberquake better for a Focus build because you'll have more mana to spam it, or does it actually scale better with weapon damage?

If I go the Flame Hammer route what is my primary bar builder?

Another tip I got was to max Tremor, which seems like an OK idea.

You decide.,BroCube,23,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/11cnaa/i_confirmed_you_can_find_and_open_secret_areas/,"I am in Chapter 3. I farmed Notches Mine a handful of times via rerolling, got every sword, and decided to move on with the game. I rerolled my map one extra time for good measure, and was slightly disappointed when the map I decided to actually play on didn't have Notches Mine. C'est la vie.

Fast forward a while later. I full-clear the map, kill Cacklespit, and then quit to eat dinner. When I load the game back up, I head toward Emberworks. Just as I am about to enter, I notice that Notches Mine is   on my map. I was 100% certain it was not there before, and 100% certain it was there now. I decide to finish Emberworks first before I go kill creepers. Well, I died, so I warped back to find that the cave was gone again.

With a lot of experimenting, I figured out how to get the mine open without a reroll:

* Go to town, save, quit, exit the game
* Open the game, take the warp to Sundered Battlefield
* Check your map. If it's open, enter. If not, just close the game without saving, and try again

The reason I think this may be a bug is because you can enter the mine fine, but when you leave, you spawn in front of the door to Rivenskull Gorge and Notches Mine is no longer there. However, if you find the mine normally on a fresh reroll, you leave through the door you came in and the mine persists.

You see, I really want to do cool things with my guns/bows when I'm playing a ranged class and the Outlander has only a few skills that focus on this style.

After giving up on the Outlander, I thought about building a cannon Engineer. I mean, cannons are both awesome and ranged! To my disappointment, there are only 2 offensive cannon skills, and none of them uses the charge mechanics.

Now I guess that I'll have to try a  melee class. It seems like the Berserker should feel adequate as a melee guy. Is he the guy for me? How should I play him?

And a more rethoric one: why don't I have real shooty guy in this game? I'd pick a Mage/whatever if I wanted to throw spells out of nowhere at my enemies.

Wat do, r/Torchlight?

**edit:** Thanks for all the replies. It seems that I might have been misunderstood by some of you. My main gripe with the Outlander, is that ""Role Playing"" a shooty archetype has a pretty narrow choice selection, not that it doesn't exist at all or isn't viable. Same for the cannon Engi.

This makes sense, as I have decent stats/level, so as long as the item isn't for a **higher** level than I am **and** requires a lot of a stat **I don't have**, the only reason I wouldn't be able to equip it is because its not equipable by my job (which I've only seen on uniques)

1365077157.0,19,self.Torchlight,1bnm5e,Anyone else worried that Multiplayer will be extremely splintered with the GUTS Mod system?,Xen0nex,23,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/1bnm5e/anyone_else_worried_that_multiplayer_will_be/,"Hi, ~~I haven't actually played since the update (Had a ton of stuff in a giant Shared Stash Mod, so I'm working on getting it converted to GUTS in order to retrieve my hoard before continuing)~~[converted it and got my gear back :D], but the new Multiplayer Mod system, at least the way I've been led to understand it, sounds very worrying.

Please correct me if I'm wrong(And I really hope that I am), but I think with the new system, You can **only** play online with others who are using the **exact** same combination of the **exact** same mods as you.  

With the old system I used a Shared Stash mod, a Stash Mod, and an Increased Draw Distance Mod, all of which only affected my client.  I was able to easily play online with others using Vanilla, or using any Mod that **didn't** change something game-wide (Like adding new classes, new skills, etc.)

I'm still trying to either find or make GUTS versions of those mods, but even once I do, I'll only be able to play online with people who are using exactly those 3 mods, and nothing else.  Furthermore, the mods will need to come from the same source (e.g. If I'm using my homemade conversion of the Sharedstash Mod, but someone else uses an 'official' version the author creates later, even if they are identical, they will be incompatible).

**EDIT (I checked out the Steam Mod store):** This problem is exacerbated by the fact that there already seem to be several mods in the Steamworks site that do almost exactly the same thing.  E.G. Out of the half-dozen Inventory/Stash Mods, 2 are nearly **identical** (one adds 25 Shared Stash Gear pages, the other adds 30, everything else is the same), and one of *those* has a regular and a ""Lite"" version.

If you're into using either combinations of mods, or mods that aren't super popular, then odds are you won't find anybody else with the same mod-combo.  The way things stand now, I can only see this translating as, 

* **If you want to play online, you can only do it as Vanilla Torchlight 2, or using the Synergies Mod by itself.**   

*****

Do I have an accurate view of the new system, and if so, is anybody else worried about this?  

I don't know what the best way to address this would be.  Could possibly a separate tier of Mods be made: ""**Clientside Mods**"" to include things like Shared Stash Mods or cosmetic UI mods that only affect the client and therefore shouldn't be incompatible with Vanilla / most other mods?    Or conversely, only tag Mods that alter game-wide elements like enemies/classes/skills/etc. and only make *those* ones necessary to be enabled on all players in an online game?

Does damage reflect reduce damage by X or does it just damage a monster for X every time they damage you (similar to how thorns works in diablo)?  

Does it take effect before or after resistances?  

So from my understanding different ways it could work are as follows. Lets assume we have 50 damage reflection:

A.

 -Player is hit for 100 damage  

-Damage reduced by 50 

-Monster takes 50 damage

-Damage reduced by physical armor   

-Damage reduced by physical damage reduction %

B.

-Player is hit for 100 damage

-Damage is reduced by physical armor

-Damage is reduced by physical damage reduction %

-Damage is reduced by 50

-Monster takes 50 damage

C.

Damage is not reduced at all and the monster simply takes 50 damage.

    





Option A seems good, maybe a bit powerful with how much damage reflection you could stack.


Option B, where an additional reduction happens after the % reduction seems too good to be true.


Option C seems pretty worthless.",,False,self,t5_2rb10,1349769958.0,,,True,t3_116qkj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/116qkj/how_does_reflect_damage_work_in_torchlight_2/,
1349151882.0,17,self.Torchlight,10sulg,No-Dex Outlanders??,CobaltBlue,24,7,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10sulg/nodex_outlanders/,"I was somewhat dismayed as I was playing my Outlander, that *unlike* the other classes, all the stats seem really beneficial to them. Mages can ignore strength entirely, Berserkers can mostly ignore focus, Engineers can mostly ignore dexterity. So I thought about it.

I've come to the conclusion after some testing and thinking that the Outlanders ""ignore stat"" is actually dexterity! 

**Reasoning**, noting that this is just for outlanders *in general*, who may use a variety of skills, *not* some specific build that doesn't use attacks X, Y, or Z, in favor of only using A, B, and C:

**Strength** improves crit damage.

**Strength** can improve damage from the following skills:

* Most ranged weapon attack (left click) damage, including wands
* Burning Leap*
* Chaos Burst
* Flaming Glaive*
* Glaive Sweep*
* Poison Burst*
* Rapid Fire
* Rune Vault
* Shadow Shot
* Venomous Hail*

**Focus** improves chance to Execute with dual weapons.

**Focus** can improve damage from the following skills:

* Magical weapon attacks such as wands and extra elemental damage on other weapon attacks
* Bane Breath
* Bramble Wall
* Burning Leap*
* Cursed Daggers
* Flaming Glaives*
* Glaive Sweep*
* Glaive Throw
* Poison Burst*
* Sandstorm
* Tangling Shot
* Shattering Glaives
* Venomous Hail*
* Vortex Hex




**NOTE* that some skills (those with asteriks) are improved by both STR and FOC! Also, some skills only appear on a list after extra skill point allocation

**Vitality** obviously keeps you alive when you get hit and you have to put some into vitality  no matter what your build is.

What does **Dexterity** do for the Outlander though? Dodge chance is nice, but you really should be avoiding getting hit anyway. Crit chance is nice, but unlike the berserker, there are no outlander mechanics that proc on crit or anything. Fumble recovery is also nice, but unnecessary. Dex also lets you equip weapons earlier than their level. 

AND THAT'S IT. It doesn't increase damage significantly except through crit chance, and your damage is likely to be more greatly increased by STR or FOC. It doesn't increase survivability except through dodge which shouldn't proc that often since as a ranged class you should avoid getting hit anyway. If you can stand to wait until item level to equip stuff, you could never put a point in Dex and be amazing.

I hate how counter-intuitive this seems. I instinctively started putting points into Dex from the get-go on my Outlander because it's a ranged class and all the ranged weapons require dex to equip, plus that's just the RPG trope.

Do you guys agree? (Though please don't tell me that *your* special build only uses wands and a magic attack, I want to discuss the class as a whole)

**(As usual, I have all the mods linked in the video description and I will happily answer any of your questions about these mods here)**

So there are a few new updates for the SynergiesMOD but nothing big lately like we're used to; just a few skill tweaks. Salan recently posted on his twitter that he would like to bring on another mod author to help him with fleshing out the Paladin. [Here is the forum post where he goes into detail about things](http://forums.synergiesmod.com/index.php?topic=2763.0)

Combine the all has had quite a few updates to it, *[literally 5 today alone](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/144038875)* so there's been a lot of stuff going on with his pack. There is a pretty nasty bug involving any vendor that has modded-in items that aren't in the pack but I believe that he's already working on it as I type this so don't expect it to be around for long.

-So Death's Grim Gate is a mod by Bandit that makes Dying a little more interesting by throwing in 12 random death events into the mix instead of the 3 choices you usually have. It's a nice addition for those that feel choosing your fate is too lenient but permadeath is too harsh.

-The Recnam Rising mod is a new quest line in the Estherian Enclave that has a full story in it already and the author says he's got a lot more coming. I like what's already in it and I'd definitely recommend it!

-Last but certainly not least is the Dragonus. The Dragonus is a polearm centric class but has several other builds as well. All of the skills seems to be there but the class is in it's alpha stages so expect lots of tweaks in the future. The class is playable and not too OP'd at the moment but something needs to be done about it's quest drops (it's hard to make a lance character if you never get any stinking lances)

My main probably will be an outlander ... great set of skills love the shotguns, you have critical chance/damage  increase, increase range/damage ... and not to forget the later 27 i think evade passive ... which all in all give you a ton of survivability in the game ... 

The mage i found to be one of the most weird skilled one ... i mean i understand probably that bottom line you want the Charge-up passive at max to be able to spew skills at no cost ... but from my perspective it didn't last that much ... and most of the time i would end up with no mobs to spend the skills after i downed them all just to charge it up, so i chose another playstyle ... found a 15 mana per hit wand with another character and dumped my skillpoints in the molten hammer skill witch is tons of fun as long as you can find the means to get the mana for it ....

The engineer i realized was the 2hd weapons god ... like my first char was a berserker and i was a bit disappointing that i wanted to go heavy weapons and it was specialized on claws ... which is great though i thought of him in a more barbarish kind of way ... but look no further the Engineer has what it takes to scratch that 2hd big arc itch that you want ... :D loved it .... 

Berserker ... this is a more fast paced character ... didnt get him to 21 cos i made an engy after i hit 15 with him i think ... but i thought his charge-up was the coolest ... every hit you deal after the bar is filled is a 100% crit ... which is awesome ... 

Bottom line:

Mana per hit is a great affix to find ... be it on weapons or prolly on soketable stones ... which are in a great variety ... Also mana pots are not as common as health pots and the charge is progresive rather 15 mana per every hit ... which i found to be a lot :)

Shotguns are AWESOME! great firepower, awesome play dynamic ... being able to pulverize mobs at no mana cost as a ranged class is awesome. 

Its a great game and i'll buy it as soon as its out :D

I progressed quite nicely with my Embermage after a disappointing start with an Outlander and have since arrived in Act III. I haven't read up on builds much since it's my first playthrough, but I consider it solid, having put most skill points in the fire tree passives, Magma Spears and Blazing Pillars.

Except for the Luminous Arena so far nothing has caused too much trouble, but I had this nagging feeling something wasn't alright and now that I've switched the Act I noticed.

I'm drinking health potions non-stop. 

Combat has barely begun and I've already lost half of my health. My little mage is sitting at 2.000+ health, wears a shield, has most resistances between 100-200 yet every single fight is just as much about potion management as it is about positioning and damage. If it weren't for the Ice teleport I'd probably be dead a lot more often, too.

The thing is, I'm not missing out on damage or anything, most foes drop after a spear or two and only named monsters and bosses last for a significant amount of time.

So here's my question - this can't be it, right? Is this how the Embermage will play out throughout the rest of the game? Or am I missing some core itemization or skill options?

I'm semi experienced at ARPGS from D2 way back when but I'm no pro in my opinion.  I played through the game as an embermage on single player elite, dying maybe 20 or 30 times.  I don't find this number that impressive, as I am a long shot from being a HC talented player.  However, it also is not an excessively high number.  I never died more than once or twice on any one particular encounter and was never significantly frustrated by slow progress.  

I happened to glance through my achievements when I got my spam from killing the nether king and I noticed that globally 21.5% of players completed the game but only 1.7% of players did so on elite.  So only about 8% of players who beat the game are playing on elite.  I found this very surprising given my experience playing through.

My question is:  Is there a practical reason why that figure is so low?  Am I better than I thought I was compared to average Joe?  Is there no loot difference so people just don't care?  Do people prefer to be under-challenged to avoid death related stress?  Has the general ARPG skill level dropped since it has become a less popular genre compared to 10-15 years ago?  Or maybe I'm missing something?

I went into the portal and the event was ""Avoid the Lava"", There were several platforms with chests ranging from normal to blue style.

I ran around the platforms and found the exit portal, but was greedy and continued to collect chests, until I became trapped and the lava killed me.

I chose to resurrect at the start of the dungeon, it ended up bugging out the exit for me but allowed me to continue to use the entrance portal, which would just reload the event over and over again.

So, for the next 90 mins (until my pack and my pet pack was completely full of unique) I farmed blue chests.  I found a perfect path in which I could collect 5 blue chests before having to use the portal to reset the event.

Went from 25,000 gold to 345,000 in 90 mins.  Went back to town and identified all the gear and put away all the unique gems in the stash.  Replaced all my gear with the lvl 47 unique's execept for the helm which I needed more vitality to wear.  

Dual Longshot pistols are....amazing at .48 attack speed with mana steal gems in the weapons and 25% to pet/minion dmg in all the gear.  (I am glaive toss/bat minion build)  

So at this point, I can shoot and kill a mob, a bat will spawn which stays up a long time with the build, my bird rushes in, and he has zombie summon 3, and ghoul summon 3, he summons 5 minions, and BOOM, +25% pet/minion dmgx 6 gear items, they shit on everything hahaha.

* So long as it's not from a gem, it scales with Focus (Yes, this includes Physical DoTs).  

* Some DoTs apply damage within a random range, like most weapons do.

* So long as it's not from a skill, it will stack with itself, but not extend the duration of any DoTs already on the enemy (and vice versa for skill DoTs).  

* If it's a weapon native ability, enchant, or gem, then skills that use % Weapon DPS will apply the doT, albeit reduced (or increased) to match the % of Weapon DPS they do.

However, I was fiddling around with a a pistol I recently got some nice DoT enchants on, and am now confused.  As far as I can tell, the console combatlog doesn't even list DoTs at all (please correct me if I'm wrong.  Reading that thing is like trying to learn a new language)  So going just by the little icon tooltips above the combat dummy in town, everything seems to be behaving as expected, except for two things:

* My Fire DoT is doing **way more damage than it should** and I don't know why.

* My Ice DoT *does* deal the damage I expect, however **that damage seems ""locked.""**  It neither stacks with itself, nor gets scaled down according to % Weapon DPS when applied by skills.

Again, this is assuming the tooltips are accurately telling me what is happening, which I am starting to doubt.  I've tried it using Rapidfire and Venomous Hail with consistent results.  For simplicity, [**here is what happens**](http://i.imgur.com/BWrY7ba.jpg) when I shoot the dummy once, and [**here is what happens**](http://i.imgur.com/WNsRLFm.jpg) after I shoot it continuously for 10 seconds.  On average, I end up doing almost exactly double the damage I expect with my Fire DoT, and the Ice DoT is just always around 1000 damage, no matter what.  

For reference, [**here is the pistol with DoT enchants**](http://i.imgur.com/tJ1JPMd.jpg) being used (I took off the other pistol to do the tests) plus Arcane stats, [**and here are my Attributes.**](http://i.imgur.com/CrBY7Qk.png)

Although...I've been reading how fun Canoneers are having and even the possibility of DWeers.  I've been putting most of my points into Flame Hammer, Heal Bot, Forcefield and getting Supercharge, Heavy Lifting and putting my stats into mostly Str and Vitality, usually a 3/2 ratio for now.  I've also put Dex up to 50 for the Crit chance.  

I'm playing on Veteran...and it's taking quite a while...which is perfectly fine for me, I enjoy a nice challenge.  However...bosses just take FOREVER to kill.  And lots of kiting...which also isn't necessarily a bad thing.  However...should I be putting my points elsewhere?  Should I be getting better gear?  I feel as though my gear isn't quite up to par to where I should be.  I'm level 50 right now and am currently using Wraith Lords hammer.  Any thoughts?  Should I respec to something else?  Maybe reallocate my points somewhere?

I'm not complaining...just trying to maximize my potential...and I certainly don't want this to just be face roll easy either.  I'm enjoying the game and just would like some input!

Thanks 

*Update-So I played around with Emberquake for a while with my Wraith Lord's Hammer and I enjoyed it...but I still felt something was a miss.  I finished up the final boss in the Emberworks with Emberquake...and received a unique shotgonne.  It's always tempted me to go Blast Cannon so I though...why not...chug a respec potion and have at it.  Switched my skills to a summoning/cannon build with Forcefield...and holy cow...my damage skyrocketed.  I can stand back...throw up all my minions and just unload with blast cannon and melt enemies in front of me.  What would have normally taken me 5 minutes to clear I can clear in a minute if not less.  The Alchemist?  So easy...took less than 4 minutes for all 3 phases of him.  Where I would have been using FH or EQ it would have taken longer.

* A more difficult fishing mini game in the harder game modes such as Veteran/Elite. Basically, remove the icon that alerts the player if there is a fish so that they have to depend on the slight tug seen on the fishing line. Also, having slightly weaker fake tugs could be good too.

1348434313.0,16,self.Torchlight,10cwe2,Berserkers - my experience with skills that broke the game,atterana,18,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10cwe2/berserkers_my_experience_with_skills_that_broke/,"Hi! So I've been playing a Berserker as my main toon and I specialized in the following skills:

Passives - Blood hunger - ALL THE POINTS, Frenzy Mastery 5, Shred Armor 5

Actives - Shadow Burst - ALL THE POINTS, Eviscerate - ALL THE POINTS, Battle Rage - ALL THE POINTS &amp; finally, this little baby right here Battle Standard...and yes, ALL THE POINTS (although getting just tier 2 bonus would be enough I guess)

The thing that was frustrating me the most on my berserker was that I was almost always mana starved. I'd been putting points between strength, dex &amp; vit kind of randomly, although once I crossed level 30, I've been biased towards Strength a LOT more than Dex.

So first and foremost...I firmly believe that every single berserker out there (yes every single one, without exception) needs to have Battle Standard up to Tier 2. The standard buffs your crit, dodge, charge generation and if you get the Tier 1 bonus, Mana Regeneration. It starts you off with 24 mana over 4 seconds and just keeps improving (I'm at 30 mana per 4 seconds atm).

This is HUGE. So huge that I am able to stand in one spot and keep Eviscerate pressed and spam that thing till the cows come home...and my mana globe doesn't even show a decrease, it regens back that fast.

Losing health you say? You have Shadow Burst maxed out (I'm currently getting 40% of my total HP back from each cast as long as I hit 4 mobs with it)...spam that 3 times and you just got your entire HP bar (and then some) back.

The nice thing is, with a few points in Frenzy Mastery, you're going to have your Charge bar filled most of the time. And the DOT on Eviscerate stacks. And the crits...keep you healed all the time.

Also, in case this was not obvious, you get Battle Standard bonuses for the entire 25 second duration of the summon (10 sec cd) as long as you are in the area. If you are outside the area, 4 sec timer applies. If you dash back in and run out again real quick, the 4 sec timer is refreshed...no diminishing returns.

I've been facerolling through Act 3 Veteran and so far it has been a blast. I ditched dual wielding and just went with Fist wep + Shield for the extra armor and block bonuses, as this lets me stand in extremely huge packs and spam Eviscerate &amp; Shadow Burst while also allowing me to survive the huge burst damage incoming from those dirty mob packs in Act 3 (I also stacked poison resist up to ~350, phys armor ~390).

(level 38),BrainsAreCool,18,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/10a4i9/just_thought_id_share_my_experience_and_thoughts/,"So far (level 38) I **love** this character, as soon as I noticed that Large Weapon Expertise affected Cannons and that cannons let me AOE stun at early levels I knew I was going full ranged.

My play-style is basically me running around with a giant cannon AOE stunning and blinding mobs with Blast Cannon. The only thing I spend charges on is Forcefield which helps tremendously in all situations. I have a Tier I Heal Bot that is fairly useful, but I rarely take damage anyway and the healing is pretty negligible. 

Since I rarely spend charges as an engineer I decided to abuse how tanky Forcefield makes me in a real big way, Forcefield in conjunction with Charge Reconstruction is amazing - you'll pretty much have your shield up at all times which means that you'll pretty much absorb all damage. o_O

Although, at this point, it's not like I need to absorb all damage anyway - Blast Cannon pierces through enemies, hits like a truck, blinds them, stuns them and knocks them back. 

Right now I have a single point in Charge Reconstruction, Aegis of Fate, Shock Grenade, Gun Bot, and Seismic Slam. I *really* wish I could remove my points from Seismic Slam and Shock Grenade since I never use them and will probably never need to since my normal attacks stun enemies so frequently. 


_______________________________


I find the engineer to be pretty damn strong and honestly wonder how the other characters measure up to him. I'm ranged yet I'm not squishy at all, I have *passive aoe crowd control and debuffs*, I buff my allies and minions, and my bread and butter spell, Blast Cannon, does a good chunk of damage and goes through units. 

The only thing that does seem to occasionally suck on him are boss fights, but now that I have a good amount of points in Forcefield it seems like that's becoming less and less of an issue. 

What do you guys think of the engineer? What do you think of my approach? How do you play him?

I bought Diablo 3 thinking it was going to be amazing, and much to my chagrin, I did not enjoy it and I found myself having to constantly force myself forward. My main gripe is that none of the loot felt rewarding enough to justify playing.

Now I downloaded the Torchlight 1 Demo and was playing through it and I was blown away. I even forgot how much I missed skill trees. &lt;3

Anyway I had some questions about Torchlight 2 as I am eager to get it!

1) One thing I missed from Diablo was the red and green text on items indicating if they were lower or higher values than my current equipment. Will that make an appearance in TL2?

2) How exactly is the multiplayer hosted for TL2? Is it locally hosted and our friends connect to us? Or is there some servers that Runic has that we will play on?

That's all for now I think.

I'm strongly considering creating a paladin class mod for Torchlight II, as I've always loved the paladin archetype and playstyle in (A)RPGs.  I know others enjoy the paladin playstyle as well, and I wanted to get some suggestions and feedback from the community before fleshing out the character too much.  I've never made a mod before, so I'm not entirely sure what I'm in for, but I'm willing to give it a good effort, and hopefully it will see the light of day as a balanced, functioning character.  If I can't manage it, I will gladly pass on whatever progress I make to an experienced modder who would be willing to finish it.

I played the original Torchlight (and the paladin mod created by [CCCenturion](http://forums.runicgames.com/viewtopic.php?f=20&amp;t=8905&amp;start=0)).  The skill trees I currently have in mind are as follows:

**Paragon/Templar**:  A defensive skill tree focusing on shields and one-handed weapons.

**Divine**:  A blend of offensive and defensive skills with some medium range spells and group buffs (holy bolt, auras, etc.).

**Zealot/Crusader**:  An offensive-focused skill tree specialising in two-handed weapons for maximum fun and damage.  

Any input would be greatly appreciated, as well as any tips, tricks, and resources for creating this mod.  I understand that Runic will be releasing a new version of TorchED for Torchlight II, so I'm not sure how much concrete information is available; I'm mostly focusing on nailing down the core concept and abilities at this point anyway.

1337377810.0,13,self.Torchlight,ttvqv,Torchlight II beta thoughts. (x post /r/games),ZoomyRamen,17,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/ttvqv/torchlight_ii_beta_thoughts_x_post_rgames/,"Played since it kicked off, reach Level 20 with outlander as well as reaching game rank: Well known, super fucking famous basically.

I've actually been very excited for this since really liking the first, not being much of an ARPG fan this was a turn for the interesting. I was pretty chuffed then to get into the Weekend beta pretty much as soon as it started and after vigourously preparing my clicking finger I was ready to go.

First things first graphically, the game just looks a whole lot nicer. The world is much more attractive and my eyes weren't just witnessing a grey blur as I wandered about the sometimes lucious, sometimes, snowy and sometimes piratey world! It's a leap up from Torchlight artistically and technically. It makes a world worth exploring and explore you most certainly will (segway ftw)

Torchlight had size issues, it was a relativaly small game, and speaking from experience sometimes size does matter but lets not ponder my inadequacies lets talk about just how god damn BIG Torchlight II is. Torchlight II is god damn BIG. There is plenty to explore and with quests and loot boxes lying about theres always a reason to explore. Another thing I like is the fact that in a given ""area"" the enemies will change radically, for example in one snowy area I was one minute fighting Skeletons, to then ghosts and then onto human bandits. One issue is that perhaps quests are spread too thin among a relatively big world. Could also do with more skeleton pirates - they are the best kind of pirates.

Combat was another thing that recieved it's fair share of complaints in Torchlight and thankfully it's been pretty much fixed. The combat in TL2 is fast, fluid, heavy and fun. Nearly every encounter is thrilling and I've had a lot of fun playing with my Outlander. I can throw a glaive so hard that enemies will blow up, that is fucking awesome. Only problem however is that the explodefest that is my glaive is pretty much the only ability I use, I don't really need to use much else to get through combat. Whether that's changed further on or more likely it's because I'm a wimp and on normal. Overall though, left clicking to kill is pretty damn fun in TL2.

One thing that does need tweaking is mana potion drops, at a rough estimate I would for every one mana potion i'd be getting 378 health potions. Aside from that, loot was pouring out of each orrifice and not just plain old grey/white loot, plenty of rares and uniques were about, this was couple with a good number of ""elite"" mobs which made for a rewarding experience! 

Overall, bravo Runic, bravo. It's a massive improvement on Torchlight and one i'm eager to purchase and play to my hearts content.

Also, you can turn an eagle into your personal shopper. Think about that power.

**[This is the Sprite by SkiesUpHigh](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Faqj6wOtBvM&amp;feature=youtu.be)** *(Of course I am going to name something called the Sprite ""7Up"")*

The Sprite is currently an Alpha WIP that is available direct form the author or in The Community Class ModPack. The Sprite has many ranged magical abilites and even **starts with this cool wand that fires spirit wolves instead of projectile energy bolts**. It has a couple staff, club, and hand centered abilities in one tree but what drew me in was the Bow/Wand abilities. This is not quite the ranger class a lot of us are waiting for, but it's pretty close to a Bow specializing class.

Not all of the abilites are finished and a good portion of them don't even have tier bonuses yet or skill progression (it only takes one point to get the whole skill for some abilities) If you want the latest form the Sprite as they happen I'd suggest subbing to SkiesUpHigh's version of the mod too so that you can get the latest updates as they happen.

A couple last minute things too:

**Derinkuyu 1 has been fixed up so it's a lot smoother now**

-while we're on SynergiesMOD, **The Sprite was not intended for use with synergiesMOD, However, I played using Synergies and I was just fine and the class preformed just fine against the volume of enemies SynergiesMOD throws at you**

-Lastly, I may be focusing a lot more on first impressions of classes for a but since It's a long grind to 100 (even with an x2 XP mod) and a lot of the new mods are more endgame-focused.

[Meet the Techmage!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e2RVK_OBww&amp;feature=youtu.be)

So I've found a few new mods to take a look at like combine them all, which comes pretty close to living up to the literal interpretation of it's name, and some other new mods like the Ringbearer Text pack and Final Fantasy weapons pack. I also take a look at the new Techmage class and find out an important bit of info we'll get to in a sec. Oh, and I give a quick tour of the new Table Mountain area in the SynergiesMOD since I never got around to doing that before.

Let's get that PSA out of the way first, ***If you intend on playing the Techmage make sure that you use the same mod for it each time. Your save files will not work if you start the character with the Techmage
mod and then load it with the Community Class Modpack and vice versa. Hopefully something will be done about this soon***

Other than that, I enjoyed what I've done with my iterations of the techmage so far and I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that I don't lose this one too (He's DrHorrible #4)

So as for the other mods, I tried combine them all and I find that it does pretty much have everything you could want short of runescrolls, a texture pack, and custom classes. It's quite the bargain for the sheer number of classes it contains.

As for the Final Fantasy Weapons, they've got a lvl 50 requirement or a low-mid level (like late 30's low 40's) stat requirements. *However*, It's Level rated for **level 90**. I figure though that if you download the mod that you're not doing it for your build. (they're drop or store bought by the way)

I was curious how the ""Charge rate increased by X%"" gear affected skills which say they gain a set amount of ""Bonus"" charge (E.G. Dynamo Field, Shield Bash, Blazing Pillar, Glaive Sweep, etc.)

Basically I checked how many casts of Dynamo Field on the town dummy it took to fill my Engineer's Charge Bar, then equipped a ton of ""Charge rate increased by X%"" gear until I was supposedly gaining +81% Charge and checked again.  In both cases, it took exactly 18 casts to fill the bar.  My rank 5 Dynamo Field says it gains 0.28 charge per enemy, so 0.28 x 18 = 5.04 matches up with the 5 Charge pips on the Engineer Charge Bar.

I haven't tested this with all the other skills that gain a set amount of charge, but I assume it will work the same way.  I thought this might be helpful for anyone considering what type of gear or method to use when looking to fill their charge bar.

**tl;dr:**

**""Charge rate increased by X%"" gear seems to only affect the charge you gain from dealing direct damage, not the BONUS charge you gain from skills which specifically gain a set amount of charge.**

Warning: I am using this build on ELITE level. 

This is a great farming build for mapworks as its almost too easy and you can do high level maps at earlier levels. 

Prismatic Build: 

I was level 70 and doing all mapworks maps (even lvl 105 though I died one hit quite a bit when caught).  The 86-95 maps were a breeze. Think I am lvl 82 now and everything is a breeze. 


**TL:DR** 

Here is the build showing skills,spells,stats



http://torchlight2armory.com/skill-calc?i=2#gBqqkSATSYwCEfU7k_u7tBc5wB3Bl6eVD-nfhMbJWpe3

**Skills**







Prismatic Bolt: Tier 2 bonus. 10 points


(mana is no issue folks!my charge bar is full in like 4-5 casts anyway. I find Teir 2 is the sweet spot to never have a mana issue, you can go Tier 3 but you may run short at times, although never at later levels) 



Charge mastery: 10




Elemental Boon: 10



Immolation Aura: MAX (full time 15% damage reduction- thanks **tetracycloide**)


Deaths Bounty: MAX ( Provides health and mana which you likely will not need but it doesn't hurt. Also slows enemies down which is a big help to this build. Also provides some stun at high levels) 

Hailstorm: MAX ( Has a high chance to stun and freeze mobs, also makes enemies 60% more susceptible to ice and electric damage, both of which are components of your prismatic bolt. This skill works great with the bolt build) - Thanks again to **tetracycloide** for this information. 


Fire Brand: MAX

Ice Brand: MAX

Lightning Brand: MAX

Astral Ally: 10  (great guy at later levels, deals and absorbs damage) 

Frost Phase: 1 Point (necessary to get out of trouble with this squishy build, also travels fast) 


**Optional Skills**: In my opinion



Frozen Fate (optional): 1 point is nice to have a chance to freeze mobs



Ice Prison (optional): 1 point is great to keep enemies distanced and then dead


Prismatic Rift (optional): Not a bad skill for a couple of points although with this build its almost useless because if your farming higher level maps your a one hit quit anyways. 


**Stats**

Since your using prismatic bolt your weapon dps and all that great stuff doesn't really mean squat. So you need to concentrate on boosting your focus stat. 

I put 3-4 points into focus every level and put the others in Dex/Vit

I think I am about 400 focus, 125 Dex, 100 Vit, 50 Str

Focus is most important as it boosts your mana and your direct prismatic bolt damage and magic damage (the effects like burn, shock, etc).  

A bit of dexterity and vitality and strength does not hurt though as Dex will help your dodge and crit, Str will boost your crit damage, and Vit is armor and HP.  I usually leave the Str and Vit to the gear and invest my stat points in Focus and Dexterity. 

**Gear**

Note: Weapons will be covered later

My gear is all aimed at these things:

+Attributes (Enchanters are great for this! Save your money for Attribute/Socket Enchanters). I tend to try and boost my DEX/STR on my gear so my critical hit change and damage bonus go up. Once you are at full charge you are hitting crits all over the place. Especially when you factor in the weapon bonuses (covered later) 

+Cast Speed (The most important) 


+Charge Rate (Very important)


* + Elemental damage % (recall prismatic bolt does all 4 elemental damages and gets boosted by elemental attunement) 


+Crit damage and chance % (Not very important but doesn't hurt if you have room to spare)

**Weapons**

I have 2 setups on my Weapon 1/Weapon 2 slots


1) Weapon and Shield-  I use a weapon and shield in one of my slots for situations where I might need that block chance to survive. Also my shield gives me +20% cast rate which is HUGE!

2) Dual weapons- My other slot has dual weapons (notice I am not saying wands?) 

Things to get on your weapons and shields (notice it is the same as your gear boosts?) Also note it does not matter what the weapon is as you never auto attack with this build only prismatic bolt. 

+Cast speed (Super Important) 


+Charge Rate (Super Important) 


+Elemental damage % (Super Important)


+Critical chance/damage % (Does not work well with the prismatic bolt due to the hidden crit chance adjustment)



Since Prismatic Bolt is not a DPS/Weapon DPS skill nothing really procs off it so focusing on these  first 3 just above is how you improve your damage output. 

Earlier I mentioned that I am not saying wands when I mention weapons. This is because I am currently using a unique pistol that gives me +20% Charge and Cast Rate! (The 2 important boosts for this build). So don't worry that your mage is not using a wand or staff because its the effects that matter on this build not the weapon.  Having said that you may find two wands that are +cast rate/charge rate which is fantastic! Go for it! 

I am changing my gem suggestions from the original post and inserting what was said by **tetracycloide**

""Crit and crit damage aren't very good for prismatic bolts as the skill simply doesn't scale very well with either of those stats. Every skill has a hidden crit chance adjustment and for prismatic bolts it's a measly 8% (most skills based on weapon DPS with a single projectile are 100% by comparison). On top of that each elemental component crits independently so while you may see 'critical' pop up frequently what's actually happening is one or more pieces of a given bolt are critically hitting which isn't much additional damage. You'll always be better off with full focus then a mix of dex/str/focus for prismatic builds when it comes to damage.



**Spells**

This changes as you get higher in level so I will say the higher level spells I am using now. I say this because once you get so much bloody focus you do not need spells like arcane tools and concentration. They become useless. 

Must have spell is DERVISH (+ 30% cast speed, so much ownage)

I use elemental Overload (+30% to fire, ice, poison, lightning, Prismatic uses all four of those elements so guess what folks?) 

Now the last two can be a matter of preference. I am using Adventuring and Barter myself. I know some people will say elemental protection but elemental boon really does a nice job of that. Also there is no need for Concentration because with a high focus and such a quick charge rate mana becomes a non issue. 


**Pets**

 I try to limit my pets to one summoning spell, Dervish, highest Frost I can find, and Elemental Overload or protection.  



**Taskbar/Skillbar/Right side skills**


Slots

1) Deaths Bounty 


2) Dervish


3) Elemental Boon 


4) Elemental Overload


5) Astral Ally 


6) Frost Phase


Right side/Main skills (2) Prismatic Bolt (duh?) and Hailstorm. 

**Summary**
It kicks ass. 

I hardly even have to use my buffs like boon, overload, dervish. The only time I even bother is right before a mapworks or game boss even though I don't really need to. I was level 70 on this build getting loads of gold and giant gems etc from maps way above my level.

let's say i'm an outlander and i want to use [the voice of pain](http://torchlight2armory.com/item?i=-4523214007552755639).

since 3/4 of its damage is elemental, pumping focus would raise its DPS more than str, right?

Then I use venomous hail, which does damage as a % of weapon DPS.  as far as i'm aware, this is based on weapon dps with all damage modifiers counted.

the skill is purely elemental damage, which presumably uses focus again as a modifier to increase its damage, right?

so, a sample calculation with numbers simplified:

    100 DPS elemental weapon + 200 focus (+100% damage modifier) = 200 DPS modified

    200 modified DPS * 100% weapon DPS skill = 200 elemental damage

    200 dmg + 200 focus (+100% damage) = 400 final damage.

It works great so far. I am super squishy as long as I don't keep up forcefield, which is hard to not do. Beat the game on elite so far and on NG+ now. Aegis DOES NOT proc while forcefield is up but is a good contingency in case I can't get forcefield up for whatever reason. Charge domination because you're bound to get a full charge with emberquake on a big group of mobs. Full charge = Massive forcefield. Rotation is to jump in with Onslaught, then stun with Seismic slam, then emberquake. Jump around to avoid damage, keep up forcefield and emberquake to murder monsters.

EDIT: I would like to add, after looking at a few things, if you don't want that aegis of fate due to forcefield, take out those points and max seismic slam and onslaught for more damage and additional debuff duration.

EDIT 2: Build updated based on recommendations from pistacioshell.

The 3 heroes from TL1 kill Ordrak.  The alchemist, suffering from ember blight, takes the heart and studies it to try and figure out a cure.  He thinks he finds one, in that being near ember causes ember blight, so get away from the ember.  His thinking, what with hundreds or thousands suffering from it every year, is that he should use the heart to destroy all the ember in the world (since the heart can destroy ember and all).

Unfortunately the heart in its current state isn't powerful enough.  But, he figures the Guardians have buttloads of power.  If he sucked off (heh) the power from one of the guardians it would certainly be enough to fully charge up the heart to accomplish his goal, destroying all the ember, and thus curing the *world* of ember blight!  He's so thoughtful!

But, (again, being nice and thoughtful) he knows that draining a guardian of all its power may kill it, and that could have disastrous effects of the element they ""guard"".  So he figures he'll just take a few samples, from each of the guardians.  A little here, a little there.  See, he's being nice again, not wanting to kill any nice innocent guardians and rob the world of, say, water, or anything else.  So that's what he's up to, running around draining of little smidgens of power from each guardian.  All for the sake of the world and trying to cure a horrible disease known as ember blight.

Unfortunately, when the guardians are in this weakened state after being power-drained, really bad dudes from a long time ago called Nether-thralls have a chance to posses them.  Specifically the really powerful baddies called Nether-Beasts.  Furthermore, as mr. alchemist is traipsing across the land, the heart he's carrying is causing this sickness that makes anyone else attuned to magic susceptible to this possession too.  So, alchemist's plan isn't working out so well so far, or at least, not so well for the rest of us.

So, it's up to us other heroes to find him and smack some sense into him...or just shoot a shitload of magic at him, either way.

Shame though, his heart(s) was in the right place, trying to do something nice for everyone.

Dealt with smart game play and 'Rune Vault', quite manageable.

http://torchlight2armory.com/skill-calc?i=4#mB3f3DGIc0GlDBXUT_QlnDmwKAXiqAWs_

Stats - Focus
All stats go into Focus, you build is based around poison damage.
Your stats and gear will be invested into goal and that is damage, each point is .5% damage.  (The debate for max dodge can be made, but until level 75+, all focus)

Skills - 

Your main attack will be 'Glaive Throw' **No not level this skill until level 30**, you need to spam this skill at level 1 the mana is nothing, increasing the level of the skill is a small increase in damage.  The damage is not enough to be worth it.  Level 5 is worth the extra bounce, at level 30+ your mana is a little more manageable. (i am level 60, currently using level 5 glaive)

**Curse Daggers(max)**, is a nice increase to your overall DPS and -20% damage is huge.

**Rune Vault(1/15)**, move across the map in seconds, jump over enemy's and walls, 9 mana? take it use it for no reason, and spam it.

**Dodge Mastery**, Max it, nice buff.

**Share the Wealth(Max)**, You also receive this buff, as well as anyone in your party, summons and pets.  there is also a rumor that the 10% might be 15%.

**Master of the Elements**, At level 50, 44% more poison damage which will add nicely to the poison gear you are sure to find.  I sit at 150-250% at level 50.  (i farmed)

These are the skills you will only need to truck roll through the game, 1-2 glaives for most mobs.  Cruse for when there was a full room, 1 cast everything dead. 

Gear - two paths.  +mana regen = more glaives, still dont upgrade to high. +poison %, i like this option.

Weapons, currently using Dual Pistols but i might go Gun/Shield. Please take note, i have not fired a single shot since level 1.  


Skills you should not take goes as followed
Shadow ammo/Posion burst - You do no weapon dps, no triggers.
Long/Shot/Dual Mastery - You really do not attack with your primary, Long mastery might increase the range, personally 15 skill points wasted. you are not weapon dps!
BloodPact - my understanding -armor does not mean more poison damage.
those are the skills i thought i might clear up.

Skills moving forward - 
Flame glaive - rank 2/3 35%/50% more poison damage to on fire targets. 
StonePact - Healing, Armor, Aoe Buff - get it
Replusion Hex - Very strong, fast and will keep things at a distance. easy mode on.

Past this point, everything really doesnt matter.  Dps is capped, and you are hard to touch.


Sorry for the hard to read writing i am terrible.

I am also working on a quite strong, Shotgun Dex/Str Summoner build(Feels like how they wanted gunslinger to played)

1337699615.0,14,self.Torchlight,tzc2q,Comparison between Diablo 3 and Torchlight 2 - A buyer's guide maybe yes?,ieattime20,16,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/tzc2q/comparison_between_diablo_3_and_torchlight_2_a/,"I was typing this up in the other thread about T2 &gt; Diablo, and I figured it got big enough to merit its own post, so here we go.

Here are the relevant differences that I've seen, having been playing both constantly for the last five days:

**1. Pacing ----** 

D3 has this slow, deliberate pacing that fits the style of game it is. Everything is very ""punchy"" and powerful. The space between engagements seems 'longer' in a way, and you move slowly through relatively small areas from elite group to elite group. OTOH, the load times are much, much faster. T2 has a much quicker pacing, with smaller spaces between engagements, enormous maps with lots of sub-areas and a quick move speed. Elite fights involve a lot of running around, kiting, set-up activation, and cleaning up of mobs. All in all, a much faster-paced exploratory focus. (The key system only underscores this and I love it.)

**2. Art style ----** 

D3 has a very tight and consistent, highly detailed art style typical for the game series. The upside is that it's *gorgeous*, especially in Act 3 and 4. Some of the earlier acts suffer from ""grey/brown color creep"" but after that the game gets colorful and vibrant. The downside is unit variation-- there's just one relatively small set of enemies and NPCs per level, and it gets sort of visually boring quicker. T2 has a cartoony, simplistic art style that is often at odds with themes (big-headed cartoony brigands splattering blood everywhere seems visually clashy). However, the simplistic design means LOTS of character animations and LOTS of different enemies and NPCs with wide variations in appearance and color. The areas are huge and intricate (though not so much detailed) with a variety of themes in locations.

**3. Environment ----** 

As I mentioned before, D3 areas are relatively small (though some of the catacombs and caves can be large if claustrophobic) and relatively the same. I'm now playing in my third playthrough on Hell and honestly there's just not that much map variation; in some of the larger catacombs you can see where they've rearranged large ""chunks"" of the map, but by the third playthrough you're down to a routine of ""find the event or submaps that you know will be there, then move on"". 

T2 has *huge* environments that are randomized at seemingly every level, and though the available subequests per new area seem the same (I was hoping they'd be semi-randomized), each playthrough offers completely different map flow, orientation, and all sorts of other reasons to explore. The set pieces are awesome; enemies come crawling out of specialized nooks and crannies and from a variety of directions, the little mini-fights for treasure (the spawning waves around sarcophagi or obelisks), etc. My favorite moment in the beta was in the second undead catacombs, I had been fighting undead waves for about 30 minutes. I noticed a ton of skeletons lying around basically as ornamentation; some would come alive and stand up, but most were just set pieces. Then I saw a big skeleton impaled on a wall. I walked past thinking it was just more level flair, then watched it take the sword out of its chest, leap down from the pillar and come at me. This was *just a regular mob*, not a boss fight! It blew my mind.

**4. Game design and metagame ----**

I'll be honest, I think the skill point system is vastly outdated. TL1 brought some much-needed updates to it, such as Fame and so forth, but the basics of the system had been created in D1 and D2 and largely perfected in the latter. D3 represents innovations that I liked, and honestly it reminded me a lot of Dawn of War II's Last Stand mode, with 'wargear' acting as skills and runes. I think that faster-paced leveling up and insta-respec'ing represents much more user-friendliness and playability over restrictive and punishing skill point no-respec systems like TL and TL2. 

That said, the difficulty levels in D3, from what I understand, are either nonexistant (the first ramp up is not a bit harder really) or punishingly brutal (soloing Inferno as a casual is unheard of), and I greatly dislike gear-grinds like D2 or Dungeon Defenders becomes at the higher levels. The addition of a real money auction house makes me more nervous, not less, because it ups the stakes and makes exploitation and game-breaking more profitable. D3 was the first game I've ever gotten an authenticator for for this reason. TL2 simply doesn't have that concern, and for someone who plays games relatively casually, this is ideal. Plus, A. mods, and B. indie developers, which are both huge points in my book; Blizzard simply can't risk innovation because it's accountable to shareholders, while Runic can be quick and nimble, and the fanbase moreso. (Respec mod FTW!)

**5. Conclusions ----**

I will play D3 through to its logical conclusion, maybe beat it with another class and play around with the Hardcore mode. After that, it will get put down and left to collect e-dust on my hard-drive until the expansion comes out, in which case I will enthusiastically pick it back up for a while. But TL2, much like Torchlight, I will continue to play and pick up and tool around in for years as new mods and updates come out, and the addition of being able to play online or with friends makes that all the better.

After hitting level 100 on my first character I'm a bit tired of the vanilla acts and map works just feel very empty. That's why I thought I'd give Synergies a shot. However, I'm not quite sure how to get started with it in the first place.

1) How do I access all synergies features? I noticed changed spawns in the vanilla regions, but couldn't find any specific new mapworks maps to set me on track.

2) Do I need to grind through vanilla story mode till ng4+ again to be able to access the jolly goodness of high level Synergies content?

3) Is it maybe possible to just quickly grind through this leveling dungeon that's supposed to be included to level up to 100 without giving a f**** bout the story?

4) Can I maybe port my freshly grown up level 100 ""mad genius"" outlander to Synergies without getting my ass handed to myself immediately?

5) When ""raid dungeons"" are mentioned on the synergies web page, does this literally need I have to bring friends or can I also beat those solo?

1364185777.0,14,self.Torchlight,1ayfyf,Akimbo Shooty Outlander in Veteran.  What am I doing wrong?,Xen0nex,18,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Torchlight/comments/1ayfyf/akimbo_shooty_outlander_in_veteran_what_am_i/,"**UPDATE:**  
**So after incorporating a mixture of you guys' advice for [changing skills](http://torchlight2armory.com/skill-calc?i=4#f9FnRSsZx_r4ereH4v5wXqAzyqXQdGIvVedq603xT1d7f) and [improving gear](http://i.imgur.com/tJ1JPMd.jpg), I think I've made some progress!  Tonight I cleared the War Titan and the Three Sisters without dying once :D  (Although to be fair I think they were all a bit slower than Vyrax).  It definitely helped now that I know I can spam Entangling Shot to eventually get a snare, and though there were some close calls, I've got about 10% more Health, 30% more armor, and the 20% debuff from Cursed Daggers to keep me alive.  Even got [my first ever Legendary](http://torchlight.wikia.com/wiki/Mutant_Action) off the Three Sisters!  Thanks for the tips so far!**

I've been having a lot of fun with my Outlander in Veteran, but lately in Act 3 I've been running into issues, mainly with **Bosses**, and wanted to check if anyone had any suggestions / criticisms for what I could change in terms of gear / playstyle, or what I should have done differently for stats / skills.

* So, my build [**looks pretty much like this at the moment**.](http://torchlight2armory.com/skill-calc?i=4#f9FnRSsZx_r4ereH4v5wXsuUYQ5eQUZorlRJUB_KSPsml)  (Yes, yes, I know I've already kinda shot myself in the foot by using a Str-based Shooty Outlander, but I feel like I should still be able to get better results than what I'm doing now :P)  I'm not planning to add more Dex, and mainly prioritized it early in order to use some nice Pistols + armor my Engineer had found earlier.  My Aggressive pet Falcon has **2 Summon Skeleton, a Summon Nether Imp, and a Frost spell**, and is also sometimes a **Spider.**

**EDIT:**  Here are some screenshots showing [**Weapons/Arcane Stats**](http://i.imgur.com/obL4xpt.jpg) as well as [**Attributes**](http://i.imgur.com/CrBY7Qk.png).

* Gear-wise, I think I have around **250 Physical Armor**, and about **175 in all of the Elemental Armors**?  I use **two mainly Physical Pistols with about 0.50 sec attack-speed**, and according to my Arcane Statistics page I get around ~**700 DPS** and ~**1000 DPS** from my mainhand and offhand gun, respectively, with a 55% Execute chance.  (My Mainhand does less DPS because it has Conveys 155 Fire / 895 Ice Damage over 5 / 8 sec Enchantments, and I figure those end up dealing more damage.  In fact, a single shot to the dummy applies 250~400 Fire Damage over 5 sec and ~900 Ice Damage over 8 sec, which confuses me...)

* As far as tactics, I keep up **Repulsion Hex**, and usually have my **Nether Imp** out.  When I come across a big group, I typically open by hitting them with **Blade Pact**, putting up some **Brambles**, then laying out some Venomous Hail and picking off stragglers with auto-attacks.  For tougher foes, I'll attempt ensnaring them with **Tangling Shot** while I stand in a **Stone Pact**, then alternate between lowering their armor with **Rapidfire**, blasting with **Venomous Hail**, and using **auto-attacks** to quickly regain mana / take potshots.  **Rune Vaulting** away when surrounded as needed.

Now, with the exception of a few weird enemies who seem to take me out in under a second (Rock Trolls, those Mushroom casters that place blue fire that instantly kills me...), this method serves me quite well.  Starting in Act 3, however, **Bosses** have been proving much more difficult.  I died at least *half a dozen times* taking out Vyrax last night, and other recent Bosses have been similarly difficult.

I know I'm probably not doing as much damage as I could, but my main issue is that I'm spending the entire fight trying to avoid the Boss so I don't get instantly killed, and thus only get an opportunity to attack if I stand still for a suicide rush.  I'm guessing I either just have woefully inadequate gear and should be able to take several full hits with a Boss without dying, or there's some technique for fighting Bosses that I'm missing.  The problem is all my normal methods, like Blade pact, Brambles, Stone Pact, Tangling Shot etc. just have no effect on Bosses since they are either immune, move around way too fast for Pacts to be useful, or are in an open area where they can just skip around / fly over the Bramble walls.  Thus **I'm just always on the run**, even without taking into account any minions they summon, until they inevitably get in a solid hit and kill me.

So, more experienced Outlanders, is there any way to make this basic build viable, or have I just been using it wrong?  I know I could just make a cookie-cutter Glaivelander and blast through everything, but I really want to use an **executing dual pistols character for style reasons**.  I'm not averse to changing up a few skills or using Respec potions if it's necessary, so is there something with either my stats, skills, gear, or tactics that I could change and get a similar build to have a chance at killing bosses without dying?

* ~~For the past few days, whenever I try to log in, I immediately get an~~  
~~""**Unable To Connect To Authentication Server**""~~  
~~error.  (Not using any mods or anything, checked firewall, etc.)  Singleplayer still seems to work fine.  Is anyone else having this issue, or is it just people in Japan, or just me?~~  
**FIXED.  I had a sneaky instance of peerblock running secretly despite closing the program; had to track it down in Task Manager...  My bad :P**

* For life/mana steal, I understand the mechanics of how it gives you life/mana, but I'm confused about how it affects the *enemy*.  Since it says ""**steal**"" rather than ""**heal**,"" to me that implies it is actually taking something away from the enemy.  Does this mean, that when I add a +100 lifesteal ember to a weapon, that my attacks now cause 100 more damage?  If so, I assume this damage is neither affected by armor nor boosted by any of my stats/passives/etc.?  
The differences between ""+X lifesteal"" and ""+X% lifesteal"" then become a little blurry, because I understand that the ""+X% lifesteal"" means it just takes a portion of the damage you are *already doing*, and converts it to health for you, without adding any damage.  At least, I *think* so?  
Similarly, if I have enough mana steal effects, can I prevent an enemy mage from casting spells by depriving him of all his mana faster than he can regen it, or do enemies essentially have infinite mana?

**EDIT:  Bonus question!**

* Is there anyway to get the bonuses from fish without your pet visibly transforming? Perhaps a mod?  
I like how cool the different starting pets look, but in practice no matter what type of pet I choose I'm just running around with a giant spider anyway due to fishes :/
