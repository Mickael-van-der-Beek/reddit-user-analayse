However, we were sad to see that somebody had smashed the windows out of several cars that were parked along Channing St NE and 24th St NE, just one block north of the club. Our car was one of them. They didn't take much except for my book bag. Most everything in the bag is replaceable except for a pair of my late grandfather's WWII dog tags. They are worthless to anyone else but are obviously priceless to me. I know it's a long shot, but crazier miracles have happened here on Reddit. If any of you who are reading this live around there or find yourself in that area today, and you happen to find a green/black/gray Eddie Bauer book bag in a trashcan, behind a bush, in a dumpster, in the gutter, etc. or you just happen to find some old looking dog tags, could you please contact me via PM? I would also like you to upvote this post for visibility. Like I said, I know this is a long shot, but I can't just sit back and not try. Thank you for reading this and for any help you might provide.

tl;dr If you find dog tags and/or an Eddie Bauer book bag in DC close to where the Excision show was last night, message me. 

edit: Thank you for all the love. I've been a part of the EDM community for many years and my experiences with the shows, parties, and especially people has been overwhelmingly positive, in spite of the mainstream media insistence on portraying the rave culture in an exclusively negative light. I just wanted to add links for my x-posts for those people that wanted to extend their support.Thanks again.

Look through here to find out more about stuff you like, and to discover awesome new sounds.

As you can see, I have added tags. [deep] implies a more classic dubstep sound, filled with heavy subbass, and emphasis on percussion elements. [heavy] is.. well, heavy dubstep, not quite as noisy and distorted as [filthy], but still enough to have people look at you funny at stoplights. 

Tags are there just to help you out to find labels you haven't heard of. Don't worry about them so much, they are supposed to be generalized/oversimplified. 

**Big ups to Thaliana, dmsuperman, bballguy2757, rk91 and Yorgan for helping with additions, as well as everyone in the comments who also made a post about labels, this was only possible thanks to you!** 

This is dubstep!

So, as a beginning of our wonderful musical journey, I present to you...

**Circus** [heavy]

Founded by Flux Pavilion and Doctor P, sounds like filthy dubplates coming from Cookie Monsta, Funtcase, Roksonix, and the two founders. You've probably already heard of these guys.

**Deep Medi Musik** [deep]

Mala's label, the releases go all the way back to 2006. Medi has been pushing the boundaries of the sound for 5 years now, with releases from some of the biggest names out.

[Kromestar - Rainy Dayz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugwJ3ow83Rk)

[Goth Trad - The Clown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO51yB0OpGw)

[Silkie ft. Mizz Beats - Purple Love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaVMP4TocY&amp;feature=related)

All releases are vinyl only, so getting your hands on these can prove a bit tricky. Imminent releases can be previewed on thier website though so go check it out!

------

**DMZ (Digital Mystikz)** [deep]

Digital Mystikz is Mala and Coki, with Loefah and Sgt. Pokes collaborating on some songs (but not actually participating in the operation of the DMZ record label).  They also host the bi-monthly DMZ nightclub in Brixton.  Their sound is characterized by a lot of sub-bass frequencies and dub influences.

**Dub Police** [somewhere between deep and heavy][medium rare]?

British label, you can thank them for making dubstep what it is today, and producing artists such as Rusko, Caspa, and Emalkay. If you've heard of FabricLive37, you know who to thank.

[Emalkay - Massive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JagxmpVMCZg)

[Rusko - Cockney Thug](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riv8gXlf2xk)

[Trolley Snatcha - The Future](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arWouqZf0kk)

[Subscape - Just Coz](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8cJtKfx5yg&amp;feature=related)

[The Others - Gravity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqjQ0AvLqBw)

You can distinctly hear that ""wobble"" sound that has since taken off into strange new directions, although many of the artists listed above has since had newer releases where they have varied their production up

[Dub Police... myspace](http://www.myspace.com/dubpolice)

-------
**Dubsaw** [NO LONGER IN EXISTENSE] [filthy]

Very heavy tunes here, fueled by guitars, insane drums, and leads straight from hell. ""Filthy"", if you will

[Gravity - Eclipse (Culprate Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7MsrEaeZkI) (One hell of a massive tune)

[Suspect &amp; Switchdubs - Rotary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYumBkDcjSA)

[Point.Blank - In the Face](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmvJYeBCZ2w) (clips from the entire EP)

Unfortunately, the drum &amp; bass label Mindsaw has closed shop, and as a result Dubsaw is no longer functional (sadface)

-------

**Hessle Audio**  [deep]

Ramadanman, Ben UFO and Pangaea... Just let that sink in. The label's sound can best be summed up by the description on [Resident Advisor](http://www.residentadvisor.net/record-label.aspx?id=1474) ""Hessle Audio releases electronic music full of sub bass around 140bpm."" 

[Ramadanman - I beg you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_DU40wVfIM) 

[Pearson Sound - Psln](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMPmdTfiIRI) (Pearson Sound is one of Ramadanman's (many) aliases)

[Pangaea - Coiled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4Hgv5mmTxM) 

[James Blake - The Bells Sketch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePZs-KuSb8o)

[Hessle Audio's Myspace](http://www.myspace.com/hessleaudio)

-------
**Hollow Point** [heavy]

I don't really have much information on this label, but I will post some examples of the artists that have released on them.

[Shakes - Lullaby (SPL Remix)](http://soundcloud.com/spl/shakes-lullaby-spl-remix) (Free download!) 

[SPL &amp; Triage - Valhalla](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfgzpSSeAqU)


[Triage - Debutante](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TeHlexDxpQ)

[SPL &amp; Triage - A Flame In Your Heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTAcU-NOsEI) (my personal favorite)

[Counterstrike - Violent](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2kbba3tS-c)

As you can hear, they all have this ""rolling"" bassline feel to them, that is still heavy but has extreme bass, as well as tribal-sounding drums.

[Hollow Point Recordings Website](http://www.hollowpointrecordings.com/)

------

**Hotflush Recordings** [deep]

Scuba's record label out of London, founded in 2003. A pretty influential label and recognized as one of the first dubstep labels. Another label that isn't afraid to push the boundaries of the sound, with the likes of Mount Kimbie, Joy Orbison and Boxcutter.

**Hyperdub** [deep]

 Kode9's record label, pretty famous for releasing things that are considered to be pushing the limits of the sound. Burial was first released on Hyperdub and since then the label has kept releasing people that further the sound. 

A very varied label with sounds that can only be summed up as Hyperdub'y.

Just look at the assholes that exist in this subreddit who talk down anyone who isn't a ""true"" fan.

Inji

Treeizzle (who's also a moderator)

Niux

And the worst part is these elitists are getting support and upvotes for being assholes to anyone who doesn't listen to every obscure artist they do and been listening to dubstep for as long as they have.  All the hate is literally coming from one side.  The dubstep hipsters talking down to all the ""brosteppers,"" yet anything negative the other side says is about the individual artist being a dick, not ""ZOMG YOUR OLD ASS STEP SUCKS ASS AND YOU'RE STUPID FOR LIKING IT.""  I love how dubstep is one of the fastest growing music genres in terms of popularity, yet this subreddit's fanbase is stagnating because you douchebags are nothing but haters (ex: /r/REALdubstep)

Like Resykle said, the necessity of an alternate subreddit called /r/realdubstep is a symptom that something(s) aren't quite right. There's honestly not much truly relevant content in here, far too many self posts repeating this same shit as another one two days ago (""y do peeple h8 skrillex?!?!""), and useless nonsense like meme posts and the like.

Rather than trying to force feed people ""true dubstep"" by posting links all day, I think if people get an idea of what the genre is really about, there might be a resulting positive trend in content quality. Whether or not it's ultimately futile, I'm going to try to start a series of educational posts about the genre in an effort to give this subreddit a bit of a comeback.

So anyways, here's the first one. 

Dubstep was an underground genre for nearly a decade before it really became popular in the last two years or so, and as a result, a lot of people aren't really familiar with its beginnings.

It all really started with UK Garage, which came into existence in early 90s London. Specifically, it was 2-step garage that laid the groundwork for dubstep. A lot of it can sound somewhat cheesy (vocals especially) if you're not really used to it, but give it a shot. It's groovy music with some nice bass as well.

* [Sovereign - Truly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZF3Cdhp2vQ)
* [Zed Bias - Neighbourhood](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljz9XYbXsUs)
* [DEA Project - Need You So Badly](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNjHppsk8MI)
* [Karl H &amp; Ed Case - Killer Instinct](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuDAM4uPBvQ)


As you can see, it features a lot of the key elements of dubstep like shuffly, syncopated hi hats and an emphasis on the bassline.

Eventually, a lot of producers started to release ""dub mixes"" on their releases along with the vocal mix. This is a tradition that was borrowed from dub reggae, which consisted of stripped down instrumentals of songs, most often with the bass playing a bigger role.

* [Kele Le Roc - My Love (10º Below Dub mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiPRsoJA_C4)
* [2 Smooth - Tonite (Dub Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2l14aWLiht0)
* [Gabrielle - Sunshine (Wookie dub mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUu1aWq56vI)
* [Monie Love - Slice Of Da Pie (El-B Dub Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKjd5wu8NCQ)

What was also borrowed from dub reggae were the ideas of dubplate and soundsystem culture. Dubplates (aka dubs) in a broad sense, are acetate records. Most of the time, the term dubplate specifically refers to when producers get an unreleased track cut to only just a few of these acetates, so DJs (often the producers themselves) can play them out. Unfortunately, in modern times, true dubplates are dying out for the sake of convenience; dubs and dubplates no longer exclusively refers to acetates, they can also just be CDs or even just MP3s.

Dubplates are very exclusive, and the reason behind this is that producers want people to hear the music in the proper environment: soundsystems that can rattle your chestplate, not shitty speakers at home. People have to come see the DJs live at clubs with proper soundsystems in order to hear the awesome dubs, and therefore they hear the music in the environment for which it was made. Dubplate culture and soundsystem culture go hand in hand.

Eventually (late 90s, early 2000s), dub mixes led to a darker form of garage pioneered by artists such as Wookie (aka Exemen), El-B, Horsepower Productions, and the like. It was around this time that the signature wobble also started to emerge in some productions.

* [Roni Size - Dirty Beats (Wookie Dark Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onQmWbfIpdI)
* [Attica Blues - What Do You Want? (Exemen Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMnttc8-DDk)
* [Wookie - Scrappy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-Wru1Y2hUE)
* [El-B - Buck &amp; Bury](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMbMnYK5xZc)
* [El-B - Nobody Care](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZZNoWKvN4M)
* [Horsepower Productions - Gorgon Sound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsXLQYE5cgs)
* [Horsepower Productions - Fist of Fury](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cR9ofItBvLg)

This darker form of garage really achieved underground success around 2001/2002 at the club FWD&gt;&gt; (Forward). In 2002, the name dubstep was born, although at the time, it was also known as ""raggage"". In 2003, Skream and Benga started producing exclusive dubs (dubplates) for DJ Hatcha to play out. That same year, Tempa released Dubstep Allstars Vol. 1, mixed by Hatcha. This release really established dubstep as it's own genre, and it featured artists like Skream, Benga, El-B, Horsepower Productions, Kode9, and Hatcha himself.

Feel free to ask questions, I'll try my best to answer all of them.

Stay tuned for the next in the series, where I'll most likely be focusing on the 2004-2007 era, including the rise of DMZ.

The scene here in ST LOUIS is huge, surprisingly. Thing is, I had to essentially discover my dubstep collection on my own, until I started going to shows. 

Now, it would have been really cool to have someone to introduce me to the genre and get me started. Therefore, I've decided to make this post... my favorite dubstep and brostep tracks from the last two years. I hope that somebody new to the genre finds this list and falls in love with ** *FUCKING DUBSTEP* ** :)

Oh, on a side note... if you really love dubstep, I suggest saving up and getting a nice set of speakers and a sub or two or 6 for your vehicle. AND DON'T MAX IT OUT, because could be overbearing and sound like shit and drown out the rest of the music. Especially if your car starts to rattle. Just turn down the bass, it'll still be pumping :D

I bought my sub when I was 16, and since discovering dubstep, its probably the best investment I've ever made :D

Anyway, as you have seen, there have been more than enough topics bitching about the state of dubstep... and then bitching about the people bitching about the state of dubstep... and then people bitching about those people and so on.

So in an effort to quell this ~~circlejerk~~whatever it is...

Please refrain from posting things that are not contributing to the content on here. I would say use your better judgement, but obviously that isn't working.

We all come here to discover new and interesting music, and complaining about ""hipsters"" (who, actually, probably care about this music more than you), or people who like music you don't like, is counter-productive.

In addition, if you don't like what's on the front page here, I suggest either A.) posting more links and trying to influence those around you to the music you like (without being a dick about it), or B.) subscribing to [r/realdubstep](http://reddit.com/r/realdubstep) (or C: both!)


In addition to that I strongly urge all of you to try and post things that you don't think everyone has heard (hint: not UKF). Dubstep isn't about the latest ""filthy video game theme song remix"", it's about heavy basslines, atmosphere, and shit you can really nod your head to.

The whole virtual stage artwork was revamped recently and I have a feeling it was to support events like this. It seemed pretty popular, so hopefully they do more!

I was one of the early listeners in the room and managed to start recording about 20ish minutes before Knife Party went up. The whole set is over 4+ hrs long!

Also glad I found an excuse to use KimDotCom's new Mega service.

He simply changed the intro and breakdown and the rest is straight up stolen from the original [found here](https://soundcloud.com/phortysiks/skyline-phortysiks-remix-you). He has gained some decent attention for this, which the original producer did not!

If you would be so kind as to help then do so in your own way. Be it confronting the thief or in my opinion, giving the original producer the support/attention that he deserves.

&gt; ""Look,
&gt; There's an underlying issue with all of this- I didn't mean to rip you off nor did i mean to offend you in any way. I don't know what you use for making your music but I bassically was DJing that night and for the first 20 minutes I was toying with some of your stuff... I hardly ever DJ... it was actually my FIRST time... and I did not realize that the track that came out was only the right side with all of the universal effects and loops overtop of it. I am re-exporting it as a total track- i just never listened to it until I saw the massive amounts of listens and comments.... and i was really intrigued and then realized what had happened. I am very sorry... if you don't mind I will soon post the entire 2 hour mix (and I already had you tagged in the info) but the first 20 or so I was toying with this and some of my more progressive music and when i exported the recording I didn't bother to listen to it. I really SINCERELY apologize and I don't know how else to say it.
&gt;
&gt;I am sorry. Didn't mean to do that to you- but let me know if its okay to release the mix I made that has your music in it... if not then so be it. I understand. I was just trying to do something different that night and was ultimately careless about what i was doing on soundcloud.""

My reply:

&gt; ""I'm not offended, but it's in pretty bad taste to use part of another persons mix as your own live set, even &gt; with some additions. I'm totally fine with people using my music in their mixes, but not so much with people &gt; using my MIXES as their mixes.  
&gt; I would think that would be common sense.
&gt; It also seems strange to me that this would be your first time djing when you have fliers with your name on them from over a year ago on your facebook. but I'll ignore that.
&gt;You can put up the whole mix if you want, I just hope it's not my whole 2 hour set with slight additions.""

Edit4: SC msgs.

Message 1

&gt; No... I am not a DJ usually... I've been playing live electronic music for a long long time... this was a small party for some good people and i was trying something new... usually I have a drummer and I play the keys- this time I was using serato, ableton, the bridge, 2 turntables and an akai apc40.

&gt;I actually just got a call about the sound I gave to them for the video doesn't match up with the sound on the video.

&gt;I only played with your stuff for about 20 minutes total and i had 2 separate 'tracks' running in ableton and swapped back and forth between them being synced and was adding beats and some synth samples on top.

&gt;i am not in the business of stealing anyones music- and I also already had your name in the info for the track.. i sincerely apologize.

&gt;i only played for about an hour that night but paper diamond and michael menert played with me for a while and we just sampled overtop of eachother.

&gt;the entire mix is maybe an hour of me playing(obviously with some of your material) and then those guys come in linked through my computer and it's been more hassle than anything.

&gt;i can't say that I am sorry enough- and I hope my reputation hasn't been damaged too much by this. listen to some of my other tracks and you'll see that every single time i play someone else's music I note them in the title... and most of my music is original stuff.

&gt;the 2 hour mix will be up soon- and i'll share it with you directly before anyone else and you can tell me if its cool.

&gt;alright? again, i am sorry- i am a big fan and i am willing to do anything for you to make it up. i wasn't paying attention- thats all.

&gt;full video and track will be up soon. and if its possible for you- i'd like to have you out to play one of the shows i am doing this summer... i can offer plane ticket, $500 up front. hotel...etc. and give you profit share on the back end.

&gt;again i am sorry. can't say it enough... im honestly embarrassed so much its killing me.

&gt;hope all is well- i'll show you the track before it's up.

Message 2

&gt;So I just heard through the grape vine that you've been tearing me up on a blog? I do not DJ. before my birthday I had never spun a record in my life. This was an honest mistake and you can post everything I say but don't be selective. Clear it up so I don't have MY network falling apart. That isn't fair. And if it makes you feel any better- you're ruining the reputation of a guy who has a physically disabling auto immune disease called Lupus. Don't know if you've heard of it- but it's hard for me to walk or even write with a pen. I am not some kind of asshole loser trying to steal your precious remixes. I am just a guy who was a fan but now that I've read what you've said I'm pretty turned off by your attitude. I am who I am. I make mistakes like everyone else. I didn't mean to 'steal' anything from you. But I feel like I am being attacked and ultimately persecuted with only one side of the story- before I even had a chance to redeem myself.

&gt;I like your music- its revolutionary in a lot of ways... and i dont know if its yours or if you just DJ... but I use a keyboard, drummer, some samples... and loops i made prior... thats what I do.. i've been doing it for a while now... over a year... but i've been playing music my ENTIRE life... and when i was 18 I had a massive stroke in my cerebellum and was subsequently diagnosed with this horrible disease. Ancient Intelligence stands for everything that was once known and is now being re discovered... on many levels.

&gt;In all due respect, I've taken the erroneous track down and will be posting the 2 hour set as soon as i filter out the songs i dont need on soundcloud anymore. I respect you- but i dont respect what people have been saying about me based on your accusations. You're a smart guy with a lot of talent... and i dont know if you've liked or even heard any of my true original songs. I don't usually post 'sets' because i dont DJ and I usually dont record. I do play other peoples songs sometimes live(just like you do) and I don't think it's fair to bash me on that blog for your own personal gain. I told you straight up that I made a mistake- you might know how that works or you might not... i dont know. I'm not going to publicly bash you for bashing me I think the problem is all a mistake and misunderstanding and I take full responsibility.

&gt;If you're a truly good guy and good man, you'll help me clear my name and we can come to a mutual understanding that I am not only a fan but I am also a human and thus i make critical mistakes- this isn't the first time it's happened either.

&gt;I hope all is well.

&gt;-J

My reply

&gt;I wouldn't really say I've been 'tearing' you up really. I just posted the situation as I saw it because frankly, it was pretty funny.
I've spent a lot of time, effort, and money to get my mixes where they're at, I would be lying if I said I wasn't a little bit put off by someone playing out parts (or all) of it as their live set.
I hope you can see why. Even if you're adding stuff, even if was an innocent mistake, people at your show are going to have no idea and be crediting whats coming out of the speakers to you.
I appreciate you putting my name in the tracklist, but the issue isn't about you using one of my tracks.
I don't have any problem whatsoever with you using my music or remixes in your sets, I would encourage it even, but playing a chunk of my mix as your own seems like bad form.

&gt;That said, I think it's a bit lame to go through peoples mixes and pull out single tracks for your own live set rather than just buying them to support the artists.

&gt;I've really not gone out of my way to attack you.
I've shared what seemed to be a pretty ridiculous situation of some of my work getting ripped off, and lots of people feel strongly about that.
I had read through some of the comments on the track on soundclud. There were people complimenting the mix and you accepting the credit.
I'm still not sure which part was an accident. That you didn't know you shouldn't use someone elses dj mix as your own? That seems like it should be common sense even to non djs.
&gt;For what it's worth, most people I've talked to said I've been under-reacting.
&gt;I'm not trying to hold a grudge, nor go out of my way to tarnish your reputation.
I'm sure it will blow over in a couple days. Take it as a valuable lesson.

&gt;peace,
&gt;rook

Edit4: My buddy just linked me some videos. He claims that it was his first time djing.  Vids deleted by him.

Some comedy going on in his replies to this.

&gt;and honestly... you're really going to tear me apart for a mistake I owned up to like this... as a DJ who just plays other peoples music? listen to my tracks on soundcloud...

&gt;http://www.soundcloud.com/ancient-intelligence

&gt;they're either ORIGINALS or recognized REMIXES that are duly NOTED as your name was. You're starting fires that are ultimately unnecessary and unprofessional. I refuse to fire back because I did make the mistake that caused it- but be a bigger man and don't use my name to promote your own shit shamelessly with as much shame as can be.

&gt; i dont know what he produces because i haven't seen it.

http://soundcloud.com/magnetic-man

These two artists have redefined my preferences on dubstep. Although I never was a fan of the Skrillex style of hard punching, quick changing, all over the place bass and synth, I cannot even listen to a few seconds of any related artists without a massive yearning to listen to Minnesota to calm my dubstep soul. 

I had listened to Minnesota and Magnetic Man before, but only a few tracks like Perfect Stranger ft. Katy B (which is, btw an amazing music video) by MM, and California Dreaming by Minnesota and a few other of his remixes, but after the newest Altered States EP by Minnesota i decided to download his entire discography and am unequivocally blown away by every single damn song.

I just felt the need to tell someone. Also, since I am also a fan of hip hop, I just can't get over some of Minnesota's remixes including Gotcha Money ft ODB. Must have listened to it 100 times in the past two days...

THANKS TO LunariH, the song is [Lords and Ladies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iknm2RzbfeA) by TERRAVITA. The drop is so much dirtier when you have a solid bass playing; I'd suggest in the car or somewhere with a subwoofer! 

I was at a party this weekend, and someone played this nasty dubstep song with the deepest drop I've ever heard.

The song starts out and it's like someone's playing the harpsichord, and it kinda sounds like the theme to Inspector Gadget (no it's not the inspector gadget remix by Chrispy), and then the very last part before the drop the sound changes and goes like C-D-E-F (notes), and then it drops HARD and it goes so deep it makes my insides rumble.

I couldn't find the guy who played it, does anyone know what song this might be?!?!

EDIT: okay this is getting a lot more attention than I thought it would! I'll post the song name sometime tomorrow or whenever I find out. So check this post tomorrow (or send me a PM now and I'll make sure I PM you back the title tomorrow) for the result!

EDIT2: Okay, I recorded myself whistling the song because I forgot I'm in college and the piano is at home... [Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDrWl-GDvJM&amp;feature=youtu.be i'm fuckin whistling it lol recognize it?! the end is the drop) me whistling the tune from the beginning.

The high pitched noises I just find uncomfortable to listen to and feel they bring nothing to a track that a lower pitched noise couldn't. Also, I can't stand the new craze of putting every single fucking sound effect the producer can find on their PC into the chorus of a track, that really kills it for me too. Again, just feels like it brings nothing to the track.

I'm not being a dubstep snob or anything, just wondering if anyone else thinks the same as me. The problem is so much so that I rarely go to shows unless they are strictly old school where no squeaky noises are guaranteed. Nothing kills the mood for me more at a show than when a track with a great build up drops and suddenly 'squee wee wee weet' blasts through the room and just makes me lose interest in the track absolutely instantly, it's like an on/off switch.

Please don't downvote if you disagree, come and discuss it, I just want to find if maybe I can learn to enjoy these noises as they are killing the genre for me just now.",,False,self,t5_2qi8s,False,,,True,t3_tvyzb,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/tvyzb/just_out_of_interest_can_anyone_else_not_stand/,

1293919618.0,227,self.dubstep,euocs,I think we all need to redefine what dubstep is again. At least for this subreddit,resykle,318,91,309,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/euocs/i_think_we_all_need_to_redefine_what_dubstep_is/,"Over the past few weeks I've been seeing overwhelming posts of stuff from Mau5trap, as well as other artists that most definitely do not fit under the umbrella that is Dubstep.


Why does this matter? Because this subreddit is quickly moving away from what it once represented.


So what is dubstep? Dubstep is a mix of 2-step and garage, with an overwhelming emphasis on bass. It tends to stick around 140bpm with half time feel (snare on the 3, so the beats go 1 2 **3** 4)


Here are some popular examples of Dubstep

[Skream - Midnight Request Line](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pTSGvp7T8)


[Rusko - Cockney Thug](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riv8gXlf2xk)


[UltraBlack - Bear Trap (Excision Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8HlwYIo020) (my personal favorite)


[Rob Sparx &amp; John Maveric - Windscreen Snipa (Propa Tingz Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSEOt1mMA6o)

As you can tell, although the styles are vastly different, all employ the 2 step pattern, half time feel, and heavy basslines.


So what differs this from stuff like Skrillex/Feed Me? Simple. It gets put under **Electro**. It's at a constant 130 bpm with full-time drums (meaning snares on the 2/4 (1 **2** 3 **4** is the count)



Examples of electro

[Skrillex - Kill Everybody](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F21aifX0lZY)

[Vaski - Lost My Mind Electro VIP](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qzPnlQjBJ4) (it's even in the name here)

[Bloody Beetroots  - Warp 1.9 (GTronic remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGKPIjK9UVA) (badass bassline!)


Now I anticipate some of your responses, and will respond accordingly

**Q:Why do you care?**

A: I love dubstep, from the ambient technical stuff like Breakage to the disgusting basslines of 16bit. But it seems that in recent days dubstep has started to slack off, at least in terms of the stuff I like. So when I come here and the front page is 1/2 electro and breakbeats, that's not exactly inspiring


**Q: But these artists are good! Are you saying that we have to listen to the artists you like?**

A: No no, not at all. I never once said that Skrillex/Feed Me/anyone makes bad music. I'm simply saying that it doesn't belong here. We have a bunch of lovely subreddits in the bar on the right, such [r/fidget](http://www.reddit.com/r/fidget/), [r/futurebeats](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurebeats), [r/electro](http://www.reddit.com/r/electro) and even [r/electronicmusic](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/) where you can post whatever you want.


To me, posting a different genre in here is the equivalent of posting a picture of your bong in /r/politics instead of /r/trees, or putting rage comics under r/wtf. We made specialized subreddits for those sorts of things for precisely this reason. 


I'm expecting a lot of flames and downvotes, but I think someone needed to say this.


Sincerely, a concerned listener/producer/DJ/fan

**EDIT/UPDATE**: A lot of you are clearly missing the point. Dubstep didn't ""evolve"" to sound like electro. The two are NOTHING alike. It's not a matter of opinion, it's a simple fact. If this ""electro"" was 10bpm faster and half time, then sure it would be dubstep.


I'm not trying to be an elitist, or telling you what you should listen to. I'm simply stating that this is r/dubstep and not r/stuff_i_think_dubstep_is.

This isn't even a matter of brostep vs dubstep, this is just an inarguable case of this track not being either of the two. Sure, Flux Pavilion has made some ""dubstep"" tracks in the past, but that's irrelevant. Joy Orbison released dubstep tracks in the past, but that doesn't mean I'm going to post his techno tracks like Swims.

Generally, if it has a four to the floor beat, it doesn't belong in this subreddit.

When people called out the track for not being relevant to the subreddit, I saw replies like this:
&gt;This is more or less electronic dance music
  
Again, this is not /r/edm. If it's not dubstep, it has no place in /r/dubstep.


If you STILL don't get the differences, then read TMobotron's excellent, in-depth explanation [**here.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/electrohouse/comments/odfmd/i_want_to_discuss_electrohouse_and_what_it_is/c3gf38m?context=3)


Oh, and you shouldn't downvote people who point out that a track doesn't belong either. The now removed Flux Pavilion link is full of people being showered with downvotes for saying completely rational, *correct* things like ""but it would be cool if more of you did care [if this is dubstep or not], you know, since this a genre-specific subreddit and all..."".

And as always, ENJOY!!

i do not approve lol, esp not if they are using it to make money with advertising.

working on it


edit:  thanks for all the tips! could anyone possibly fraps it for me? I won't be able to for a few more days &lt;3

edit2: thanks to http://www.reddit.com/r/realdubstep/comments/l7dwb/saw_this_on_hulu_last_night_the_widdler_is_now/ this post is how i found out about it

edit3:  Thanks sooooooooo much everyone. Great tips, great compliments, great reddit. &lt;3 for all of you, more music to come in the future (hopefully with less muscley rubbing videos)

I am not really looking to sue them, unless things get ugly. I would mostly like them not to use it on the ad anymore. (and to hire a new ad agency, boy is that ad terrible)

final edit: i am becoming an editor... hiyo.... ok really though, for those of you who missed this (free download)[http://soundcloud.com/the_widdler/goldeneye-watch-theme-widdler] , enjoy!

thanks for listening everyone, more tunes to come in the future, scouts honor



**LAST EDIT: Talking with my label owner at Dubstep Records and with SWELLNY. The short version is there was a misunderstanding (both on my part for what the song would be used for and on their part for reasons I shouldn't post) and I am being paid for the royalties. Thanks for all words. I didn't expect you guys to rampage their youtube video like that o.o **

I believe most of us are here just to listen to awesome music and discover new artists. Sure some of us are in the wrong place from the start, but that does not make them worse people, maybe just unaware. 

In summary, when you post a track, **just leave the producer, track title, and any ACTUAL relevant information about the track in the title**. 

Don't post about how old the producer is, what gender they are, or if they need attention. It just seems attention-seeking, and that is not a positive quality. It also helps the layout look cleaner, and helps people find what they are looking for. 

Also, if you're looking on information on how to produce, dj, or just getting feedback on a track, /r/edmproduction or /r/DJs would be a more relevant place.

&gt; Most of the ""purists"" just like calling it brostep to demean the style of music not to actually create a way of defining subgenres of dubstep.

I think he's exactly right. And personally, I think further subcategorizing dubstep is a silly pursuit, anyway. Here's why:

*Most* people still have no idea what dubstep is. To those people, I say it's a type of electronic music. Anything more than that and you've pretty much lost them. Dubstep already *is* a subgenre! And a pretty obscure one at that.

It's kind of interesting, actually. I used to be really into the emo scene (shit like Orchid, Louise Cyphre, I Have Dreams, Pg.99, Circle Takes The Square, Texas Is The Reason, Fugazi, etc. etc.), and some people in that scene were *just like* people in the dubstep scene now. Those people wanted to append ""waves"" to emo music to separate stuff like Fugazi (""first wave"") from stuff like Orchid (""second wave""), because the latter was much louder and more aggressive than it's predecessors.

Of course, most of us in the scene thought this a preposterous undertaking. It was all emo to us. We had our hands full just trying to convince people that the stupid shit the media labeled as ""emo"" (MCR, Fall Out Boy, underOATH, etc.) *wasn't* by definition actually emo, rather than trying to redefine and subcategorize our own music.

Dubstep is unique in the fact that it is a *very* defined electronic subgenre with lots of ""rules"" that producers adhere to. What other type of dance music can boast the fact that 95% of their songs are written at the same tempo, with main chorus sections (""drops"", brah) appearing at the 0m54s mark? Or that almost every song ever written incorporates some kind of LFO modulation and/or throwback reggae and dub samples? Even the ""worst"" ""brostep"" offenders acknowledge the source of the genre (I'm looking at you, Doctor P... ""B-B-B-B-B-Badman sound..."").

I think the lesson to be learned here is that we are already fans and followers of a pretty small subgenre of dance music. Most people, when they hear the word ""dance music"", immediately think of some BMM-CHH-BMM-CHH-BMM-CHH, four-to-the-floor-type house music of sorts. We're so different from that! What with our swingy polyrhythms and syncopation, half-time breakdown-like sound, and killer sub. Who gives a fuck if there's more distortion on a particular artist's bass synth, or a song goes double time for five seconds?

**TL;DR It's all dubstep, bros. Let's just be friends.**

Whether you mosh to Borgore, headbang to Cookie Monsta, chill out to Burial, smoke to Sukh Knight, or fall asleep to Phaeleh (lolololol), there's always room for that here.

If you're sure it is [House](/r/house), then post it there.

If you're sure it is [Minimal Techno](/r/MINIMALTECH), then post it there.

**AND**

If you're totally not sure and it is bass and beat related then a post to [Future Beats](/r/futurebeats) or [Future Funk Airlines](/r/futurefunkairlines) is what you should do.

**Subscribe and submit to these sub-reddits, within them all lies a huge amount of awesome music.**

This concept isn't fucking hard and saves people making tiny communities that burn out as quick as you can say DerpStep. Yeah, I'm looking at you fools over the last few days that have made about three for no reason.

This community could (and used to) be really tight. Without sounding a prick, just over a year and half ago me and [sythec](/user/sythec) re-engergised this sub-reddit between us because it was dead. Which then encouraged a lot more people to join in and so it grew. Then it got silly with weekly wars between the Bro and the Dub heads (and those stuck inbetween). Some of us conceded that for the greater good of this sub-reddit that Brostep had a place. This was acceptable, even if slightly unpalatable (because going off and creating /r/brostep would have been silly and clearly North America was never going to concede once Boregore ruined Dubstep heh). What I cannot concede is things like ElectroHouse being posted, it's got no family in Dubstep.

The only mods that ever gave a shit were [lukemcr](/user/lukemcr), [beefy](/user/beefsupreme) and [logosfails](/user/logosfails). The rest are just happy to sit with their names (more recently splatt cares as they are a new mod) on the sidebar. That's why this place has gone to shit, no real moderation AT ALL and too many ignorant fucktards came here over last summer who don't know one genre from the next but like that DUBSTEP BAND, but are also unwilling to learn anything either.

It's not hard to be subbed to multiple reddits and submit the correct content to each one, stop being so fucking afraid. Learn your Reddits or lurk MOAR!

For the people that call me a hipster/purist etc, just for the record, it's no secret that I prefer the original sound, but I like some Brostep also (I played some in my set last Friday FFS and I play Darkstep/Neurofunk which is way more filthy than Dubstep will ever be), it's not the liking of Brostep and other genres NOT related to Dubstep that angers me, it's people's ignorance, it's peoples unwillingness to concede in the face of facts and clear lineage and history, it's people who think that people like me should STFU and just ""like it"". I come here for Dubstep, not your latest hard-on for Skrillex or the Wobble in a DnB Jump Up track.

So if you people want this place to be better, then help stop the arguments by posting things to the right places (**karma means nothing, but respect does**) and subbing to them all so you can hear everyone else's awesome tunes.

**OR**

The mods need to start giving a shit, or step down and let some people that do give a shit step up and start removing posts that clearly are not Dubstep.

I'll look forward to the insta-down-votes and no responses, or you can email me at bro@derpstep.com if you feel the need to privately tell me I am a purist.

If you're listening to ""dubstep"" on laptop speakers you are not listening to dubstep. Fact. 

Doesn't matter what you want to call it, if there's no subbass it's just not in that category.

That being said, I found out about a lot of awesome tunes, and want to thank everyone for contributing. 

THAT being said, the tracks that really rocked my world and made people flip me off at stop lights were

Then we go to guys who are viewed as legends and change the game, such as Skream and Loefah (Beatles, Led Zeppelin). Up comes along a Rusko and Caspa who turn it on it's head and introduce a new ""sub-genre,"" brostep (AC/DC, hard rock). This is viewed as a horrible new creation as all the old farts with their canes and walkers complaining about kids on their lawn. ""Harder"" musicians like Borgore and Doctor P come around and gain a loyal support despite their gross exaggeration of the new genre created by Rusko (Slayer, Metallica). We end up Skrillex (and others) who go so high, he is basically electro-house, not dubstep (Green Day/Offspring, basically pop, not rock). 

Now we have Doctor P, Rusko, Skream, and Digital Mystikz followers yelling at these new kids who don't respect ""hard"" dubstep or dubstep at all. We also have people who just kinda like everything. We have those that only listen to the new stuff and thinks everything else isn't dubstep. 

Now, we have all types of kids coming up trying to make their own dubstep, so we get MySpace ""DJs"" who dilute the whole system.

Basically, dubstep is rock music compressed into 8 years.

Did this for /r/Monstercat a while ago and had a blast with it. Ended up at [~2 hours long](https://soundcloud.com/michaelhill-2/cat-eats-mau5-mix) and pretty well received.

So, /r/dubstep. I've been mixing dubstep for about... eh... I don't even know 4 years. Started out with dubstep and I'm damn good at mixing it. So, hit me up with some of your favorite shit.

Just a heads up: I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PUT IT ALL IN. Sometimes a song just doesn't fit anywhere/the BPM is fucked up. For example, two of my favorites are [Bombacladd Starr](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvZLsc9vF1M) by Liquid Stranger and [Get the Money](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGtLJDP1BIk) by PantyRaid. Bombacladd is like, 90 BPM or something and Get the Money is like 150 or some shit like that. It sounds completely fucked up when I slow it down. So, don't get mad if your song doesn't end up in there.

So, gimme crap. I'm aiming to get this up by Friday. I'll buy any music I don't have, even though I have... a lot... *cough* the entire Monstercat library, ~75% of the UKF *cough*

**LINKS AND DOWNLOAD LINKS ARE VERY APPRECIATED.** Saves me a lot of time.

Edit: This is funny... I was thinking if this wasn't well recived, I was gonna do a Drumstep mix with shit I already have. This is slowly turning into a drumstep mix with all these suggestions. Fahhny.

**EDIT** I have work in a few hours, but I'm making progress. Keep the suggestions coming, I'm loving this and this mix is turning out to be sexy. And, for the love of god, from here on out try and keep it dubstep/drumstep. This means either 140ish BPM or 170ish BPM. If you don't know what that means, if it sounds like the same tempo as Ghosts n Stuff, it's 128. So, if it sounds like the same speed as [this,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZCN-TP5icE) that's 140 BPM and I will definitely be able to get it in. If it sounds like a speed like [this,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgU7XMUyAqY) I'll probably be able to get it in, looking at how this is getting a bigger and bigger drumstep section by the second. If it sounds like the speed of [this,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luJJBeCFeM0) it's very unlikely I'll get it in. I'll try it no matter what, but if it does squeeze in it won't sound that good. But if you want it in there, put it in. I'll do my absolute best to get it in the mix, 'cuz this shit is sounding crazy.

**Update as of 10:16 Central Time, June 1st:** Holy shit, this blew up more than I expected. I'm posting this from my phone from work. I got a bunch to listen to tonight... I may have to bump back the date for the final mix, but I'll fill everyone in on when I think I'll have it done tonight while I do more sorting.

**Update at 11:42 Central Time, June 1st:** Just got home from work. I'm going through all these posts now to listen to 'em. Again, I must emphasize: **Unless I get a bunch of them that actually work, (As in, a bunch of stuff that sounds like Knife Party) AVOID ANYTHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE HOUSE WITH 128 BPM.** I may not be able to get it in and you'll just be disappointed in the end, which is the last thing I want. I'll try, but I really don't wanna disappoint any of you. I'm gonna work on this until 1 AM tonight. If your suggestion's in for sure, I'll tell you ""In"" and add it to the list. If it's probably not, I will inform you why. So, let's get to work.

**Update at 1:30am, June 2nd** Alright guys... So I'm pretty sure I downloaded all the top comment posts and messed around with them. I just did a quick on the fly of a lot of them/some stuff that I think would go well in this. It's decent, I mean giving that I'm half asleep right now and just did that with no major planning what-so-ever. [I'll give you guys the wobble/wubs/less polyrhythem parts part of what I mixed for the time being.](https://soundcloud.com/michaelhill-2/wobbles-for-r-dubstep) Listen, it's not crazy good. I was half asleep when I did this, sitting in my chair, responding to people on here, on the fly, and some of these songs I've only listen to one time before dropping them in here. But, just to keep you guys entertained, here's a little snippet. I'm getting some sleep since I have work tomorrow at 11. If I wake up early enough, I'll do some more work.

**Update at 8:41 am, June 2nd.** Alright, I'm awake. Although I'm leaving for work in about an hour and a half, I'm gonna get back on this. I'm gonna download anything that I missed and then work on some more of the mix. Awaaayyyy...

**Update at 9:53 AM, June 2nd.** Alright, I'm off to work. Made a little more progress on the wobbley part and a lot more on the ""Brostep/polyrhythem"" area. Looking at how the thread is starting to die down, I'm happy with the suggestions you guys gave. Most of 'em I can use and I plan on using.

**Update at 3:54 PM, June 3rd** ANNNNND THE THREAD IS DEAD. I'm working on the mix. Threw in a song or two here and there. I'll update the list real quick and get back to work on it.

**Update at 2:19 PM, June 4th** Another Update. Currently at ~50 Minutes long. This shit is gonna be longer than expected.

**Update at 5:41 PM, June 5th** Wrapped up first part of the brostep. Moved back on to the deeper wubs/wobbles. Trying to figure out what to use for breaks. Only reason I'm continuously updating this even though the thread is dead is so people can actually see that OP is actually working on this thing. It sounds hypocritical, but it's making me happy.

**Update at 12:22 PM, June 8th** For those still in this thread and watching this, I am working on it. I have suggestions from friends that want songs in this, so I'm trying to get in theirs as well. I not only want every song in there, but I also want it to actually sound good. If I wanted to, I could get this over with and just throw everything in there right now, mix everything without planning or listening to the music you guys gave me, and say HERE YA GO IZ GOOOOOOOOOD. that's no fun. So, I'm working hard on it. If you wanna know exactly where I'm at, I finished the opener tracks which is primarily composed of brostep, the first wubs/wobbles/classic dubstep part, which included the teaser thing I already posted, and I'm almost about done with the second major brostep area. If you want exact amount of tracks per section, I got about 6 in the opener, 18 in the first section of the classic dubstep, and I'm at 11 for the first part of brostep. **YES, THIS MEANS I'M BUMPING BACK THE DATE.** I'm not gonna give my fellow dubsteppers shit to listen to. I'm gonna give them filthy shit to listen to. (god, that was terrible. I'm just gonna get back to work)",,False,self,t5_2qi8s,1371839703.0,,,True,t3_1fgx0p,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/1fgx0p/hey_rdubstep_im_a_dj_with_nothing_to_work_on/,

There were literally minivan moms dropping off their kids, who then promptly rush inside to change into their underwear. These kids are on extacy, mdma, or sugar, who knows.

Simple rule: If it goes DOOF DOOF DOOF DOOF it DOESN'T belong here.

There are many ins and outs of what constitutes dubstep and I'm not about to argue the semantics of it, but if it has a 4 to the floor beat it *definitely* isn't dubstep.

I also found that many of the r/dubstep redditors are what I would classify as ""dubstep purists"" and seem to hate all dubstep variations that defer from the dubstep that they've always known. My issue is that the people, like me, come here to find new dubstep and then get downvoted and saddened by people telling them they don't know anything and then they leave instead of learning and possibly enjoying ""real"" dubstep.

I wanted to let you all know that not all music keeps its original sound for too long. Music is always evolving. Rock and pop are definitely NOT the same as they were a couple decades ago. But they're still considered rock and pop. Brostep could be a result of dubstep evolving. Just because brostep is more popular doesn't mean that it shouldn't be considered dubstep.

Also, just so I can be educated in the way of dubstep, feel free to link me to some ""real"" dubstep and maybe enlighten to the other types of dubstep out there. I would love to learn the ways.

You, a producer guy will produce 1 DUBSTEP song which you will submit...  in 2 weeks... for a chance to be featured on our very own compilation album which will be released all over the internets for free!


You'd think this would be simple... but here are the details.

1. THIS MUST BE AN ORIGINAL WORK UNLESS YOU PERSONALLY KNOW THE PERSON YOU ARE REMIXING AND HAVE THEIR PERMISSION.

Just fucking follow this for the sake of preventing any possible headaches. Sampling is fine, but do NOT submit your remix of Levels (nobody wants to hear that anyway).

2 . It has to be dubstep. That means 140bpm. Half time snare, plenty of subbass. 

If you are confused about this point, please do not apply.  

   3 That's it! Go make some tunes!


on 5/19 i will make a post on here detailing where you should send your songs. Just as a heads up, I will need a link to it on soundcloud.

I'd rather prefer it be the first, so I would like to remind everyone to **NOT DOWNVOTE SONGS SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THEM**

That's seriously the equivalent of avoiding people simply because you don't like their hat. 

Not that anyone gives a shit about [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette) anymore, but 

&gt; The down arrow is for comments that add little or nothing to the discussion.

The world is going to be filled with things you don't like and music you don't want to hear. This is ok, but burying those things won't make them go away. 

When was the last time you were convinced by ""your music is stupid and you should listen to ___ instead""? Now compare that to nicely introducing someone to an artist you think they may enjoy. Think of it as quietly manipulating people by pretending to be nice if you want to. 

I'm considering bringing up the topic of removing downvotes again, but i really hope we can somehow get through this...

t**l;dr**: plz don't downvote submissions just because you don't like them. It's not helping anyone and you should consider what kind of person that makes you. 

Downvotes should solely be for burying spiteful or irrelevant content. Their availability should not dictate their usage.  ",,False,self,t5_2qi8s,False,,vinyl,True,t3_tywi9,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/tywi9/regarding_downvotes_and_not_being_an_asshat/,moderator

- Skrillex is an electronic music producer. He makes house tunes, dubstep tunes, and even some DnB and drumstep stuff. Not all his stuff is dubstep and no one is claiming it is. Guess what, the almighty Skream makes non-dubstep tracks, too.

- He's not a typical 'DJ'. He uses an M-Audio TriggerFinger to trigger, mix, effect, and EQ clips in Ableton Live.

- 'OMGZ HE DUZNT BEATMATCH? LOLOLOL'. Right. Just like every single other laptop DJ doesn't beatmatch anymore because it's all controlled by software nowadays. That doesn't mean there's no skill involved in properly cueing and dropping tracks.

- He's unquestionably one of the best producers currently making popular electronic music. Anyone with even a little bit of production knowledge can appreciate the detail put into his productions. It's said that he spends months at a time on individual tracks before releasing. If he wasn't a respected producer, he wouldn't be signed and touring with Deadmau5.

- 'Yeah but what a fag, he used to be in that lame post-hardcore band.' True. He had more commercial success at 17 than 99% of us dubstep elitist losers will ever experience. Now he makes electronic music. What's the problem?

- Lastly, please for the love of FSM realize that when you say 'brostep', regardless of whether you think it's an apt descriptor of some dubstep music nowadays (protip: it's not), please realize that you're doing a disservice to the genre in general. I'm not a bro, chances are you're not a bro, and I would think we've advanced enough as a culture to stop defining and redefining musical subgenres based on a particular demographic who enjoys it. Please realize that genres grow and evolve with time, and the days when dubstep was only played at Fabric by Benga and Skream and Coki are gone. Dubstep is already a subgenre of electronic music and we'll be no better than the fucking metalheads and hardcore kids who have come up with a hundred stupid goddamn definitions and scenes for themselves and fragmented the genre into near-obscurity.

Most of them unfortunately went unnoticed so I thought I would share them on here. If you are looking for typical (and predictable) WOBWOBWOB bass drops, look elsewhere. Dubstep is becoming a much more fresh, diverse, intelligent and rapidly evolving genre in the past year, especially in the UK. In fact, many UK dubstep/grime DJs are remixing other dubstep DJs instead of remixing various pop songs and what not. Feel free to add anything I might have missed!

TL;DR: This is a 2010 dubstep playlist in which none of the tracks contain the headache inducing WOBWOBWOB fart storm that is known as mainstream dubstep or better known as ""brostep"".

Even today we still get posts about new people just finding dubstep and coming here to further their journey into the sound. I remember only a year and a half ago we were only at around 200 readers. It has been really amazing to see this group grow and evolve and we will most likely break 10k readers this year.

THANK YOU everyone on behalf of me and the rest of the Mod's. 2011 looks to be a huge year for Dubstep and /r/Dubtep. :D

I'm not familiar with all of them, someone actually posted links to Scuba songs I'm gonna check out tonight, so if people know an artist better or are more into their tunes, post some links brah.

Vex'd:

I guess Lion VIP got taken down from youtube. If you can find it, it's absolutely brutal.

[Vex'd - Fallen (Remix of Distance song)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njleDMwLsvo&amp;feature=related)

[Vex'd - Disposition (Ft. Jest)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hG0w7R59FY)

[Vex'd - Angels](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul5FXfD9cEg)

I really think Vex'd have a unique sound that combines a more industrial urban sound with DnB influences, especially on their first record.

DMZ/Mala/Coki/Loefah/&amp;crew:

[DMZ- Antiwar Dub](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pBCA9mUciU) (essential for everyone into this genre)

[Mala- Changes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky5Mt2PLf9E)

[Mala- Alicia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpzzGXBW4GA)

[Coki- Goblin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cWgvo6TtZQ)

[Coki- Red Eye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCm1BEgQTW8&amp;feature=related)

[Loefah- Horror Show](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMghwdG6SOE)

[Loefah- the Goat Stare](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Ed9deW39A)

DMZ are big. Mala and Coki release under the name DMZ along with their own solo stuff. Mala's stuff is more subdued while Coki has more sick wobbles. Loefah's tunes are usually more minimal but show what you can do with just pure drums and bass and a sample.



Burial:

[Burial- Archangel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlEkvbRmfrA)

[Burial- Shell of Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kS2wE7BZel0&amp;feature=related)

[Burial- U Hurt Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AN-PxS-LAk)

[Burial- Versus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRrScojjEgg)

Honestly I could write on and on about Burial. Same for a lot of these artists, but his music is just something else. Emotional music. Urban and dark. People sometimes say that there's a Burial 'sound' (and there is, for sure) and that you know what you're gonna get with him, but I disagree with the last point. His first LP (last two songs I selected) and his second LP (first two songs) are really different sides from the same artist imo. 


I pretty much tried to pick my favorite tunes from the people I felt like are the biggest producers everyone should know aside from Skream and Benga. Some of the people in the picture are DJs (MAH) who helped get dubstep more attention as an artistic movement. Some are DJs (N-Type, Hatcha) who also produce but have helped usher in new styles and talent from the likes of Skream, Benga, and Caspa. Hatcha afaik really mentored Skream and Benga and did a lot to get them attention and N-Type really helped push the wobble heavy dubstep.

Hopefully people who know more about other producers can contribute as well. I could post Distance and Pinch songs but I'm not so familiar with a lot of their output and history like some others are.",,False,self,t5_2qi8s,False,,,True,t3_knlnu,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/knlnu/since_a_lot_of_people_said_they_didnt_know_many/,

Some people are on the verge of creating a new genre label, ""post-dubstep"", and others see new artists and styles as simply a byproduct of the genre's natural progression. Some people look at artists like Skrillex and Borgore and cite them as ""killing"" dubstep, and see the genre as a passing fad or novelty that is infecting the mainstream with remixes and sellout-ish collaborations. Others continue to see the bright side of things, praising artists like Feed Me for how they are innovating the music and also how it is presented through live performance. 

/r/dubstep, at 66k+ strong we are one of the internet's largest communities of dubstep listeners and bloggers. Although we can be hivemindy at times, we will always be, at our most simple level, a forum for the discussion of the music. 

This is why I'd really like to hear some thoughts from you guys. Here's a few questions to jump-start the brain juices and strengthen what I'm trying to say:

1. Is dubstep dead, a passing fad, or will it become another staple genre like Electro House?
2. What direction can you see the genre going toward? Reggae? Trap? Blues? 
3. Who do you see as being the current innovators? I'm not talking about who sells the most records or tickets. I'm talking about progress, invention, originality. 

EDIT: I love all the responses. I'm sorry for not being able to respond right away as it's really late right now, but tomorrow I will work on getting back to all of you on the points you raised. I am DEFINITELY making a playlist of stuff people recommend here, so feel free to keep posting links to dubstep you consider ""the future"", ""the roots"" or ""the mainstream"".",,False,self,t5_2qi8s,1349595898.0,,,True,t3_112obe,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/112obe/can_i_get_a_discussion_going_on_the_state_of/,

Edit: Wow you guys really came through. Is there anybody I should avoid? Like not true dubstep or like someone played out?

Edit 2: I'm also into chill wave, like Tycho and Lone. 

Edit 3: Hey guys is [Wolfgang Gartner](http://youtu.be/OkvXO45XL-c) considered dubstep? Cause he came on Pandora and I really like it.

Edit 4: Once again, I wanna just send huge thanks and a bigups to the entire r/dubstep community for teaching me and giving a bad ass list of samples to choose from. You guys here are super bad ass! Keep rockin' this sub's bass!

Edit 5: I had asked someone if it was bad to like Skrillex, because when checking them out I heard ""Scary monsters..."" first to see if they were alright. And I liked it, but I felt like I heard that song somewhere before and I couldn't put my finger on it.

1327853006.0,97,self.dubstep,p1r9b,Dubstep vs Drumstep: A basic guide to telling the difference,Scottyxander,141,44,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/p1r9b/dubstep_vs_drumstep_a_basic_guide_to_telling_the/,"I've noticed recently that quite a few people are posting Drumstep tracks and mistaken them for Dubstep. For some reason, there always seems to be a confusion between the two in the Dubstep community, so I thought I would **try** to explain the difference in a non confusing way on Reddit.



**Now before I start, this guide is only for people who can't tell the difference between the two. It may be obvious to you, but for some people it's not.**



Ok, before I get to telling the difference between Dubstep and Drumstep, you have to know the difference between Drumstep and DnB. There's honestly not much of a difference between the two apart from the drums. 



The first thing I'm going to do is give you a written example of a half step beat and a DnB beat, then I'll move on to details of the genres and then song examples.


**Half Step Beat**

1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and

K____________S_________


**DnB Beat**

1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and

K_______S____________K_________S___



**Drum and Bass**

* Usually between 160 BPM and 180 BPM (Mainly in the 170's)
* Inspired by Jungle and takes the breakbeat idea from it

 
Examples of DnB tracks:

* [Sub Focus - Let The Story Begin](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faZJNnKeug8) (Your typical DnB track)
* [Noisia - Cold Veins](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3dIevIciKg) (Classic Noisia track with the Jungle breakbeat influence in it)
* [Seba &amp; Paradox Feat. Kirsty Hawkshaw - The Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFz-SqEo9O8) (Liquid DnB track with the Jungle breakbeat influence in it)



**Drumstep**

* Usually between 160 BPM and 180 BPM (Mainly in 160's and 170's)
* Inspired by the half step beat in Dubstep (Hence the step in Drumstep)


Examples of Drumstep tracks:

* [Rusko - Everyday (Netsky Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FZihLJc0WU) (Pay attention to the drums)
* [Crissy Criss &amp; Youngman - Kick Snare VIP (Drumstep Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPP3LmXku4c) 



Now that you see the difference between Drumstep and DnB, it's time to move on to Dubstep and Drumstep. Hopefully now that you have a better understanding of Drumstep, it'll be more clear to notice the difference now.



**Dubstep**

* Usually between 130 BPM and 150 BPM (Usually 140 or 145)
* Half step beat 


Examples of Dubstep tracks:

* [Magnetic Man - Karma Crazy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6c7BwBwdRk) (Perfectly suits Reddit)
* [Chasing Shadows - The End](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI-31wqqLr8) (Side note: Chasing Shadows is like the Dubstep form of Neurofunk)
* [Distance - Weigh Down](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRHy_bf1EmY) (Off one of the best albums ever)



Examples of Drumstep tracks that people confuse with Dubstep:

* [Nero - Departure](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUvlOAIXeOs)
* [Bassnectar - Boombox (Datsik Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7vChXb0lK0)


Incase you're still wondering what's the difference, it's the tempo. Drumstep is much faster than Dubstep.



I kind of rushed this whole thing but it should be pretty clear. If anyone else has things to add or can explain better, just go ahead and do that in the comments.


**TL;DR:** Dubstep BPM: 130-150 (Mainly 140), Drumstep BPM: 160-180 (Mainly in the 170's)",,False,self,t5_2qi8s,True,,,True,t3_p1r9b,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/p1r9b/dubstep_vs_drumstep_a_basic_guide_to_telling_the/,

There was a time, not too long ago, when it was about feeling, minimalism, atmosphere, melody, and, if possible or neccessary, a really heavy bass line. It was somewhere between dub and 2-step. Now as you may know, dub is a form of reggae which is about rhythm, bass and effects. 2-step is the garagey sound with sub-bass lines. Where it meets there you get dubstep.

The shit that gets posted here is all about bass and nothing but bass. It's boring and gives the scene a bad name. In particular, remixing every not-dubstep tune into a dubstep tune is stupid and pointless, especially when the result is non-harmonic bad-sounding stuff like that Paper Planes remix that was posted recently.",,False,self,t5_2qi8s,False,,,True,t3_bpfdj,http://www.reddit.com/r/dubstep/comments/bpfdj/any_dubstep_lovers_bummed_out_by_the_music_in/,
