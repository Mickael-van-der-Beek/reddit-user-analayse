One of the nicest and most talented network engineers I have had the privilege of working with -- a redditor, and contributor to r/networking, Brandon Bernier, age 25, passed away this past Monday in a terrible car accident.


[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/v7p8f/the_next_few_months_of_my_life_unboxed_ready_to/) is a recent thread Brandon had here. He just finished this network and was already excited and thinking about finding new challenges. 


Brandon was extraordinarily talented for his age. He came to us at a time when we spent months looking for a new hire, and we all immediately agreed he was the perfect fit. Outside of networking he was extremely passionate about biking (the kind of guy who would inter-state bike hundreds of miles), and frequented many a reddit meetup, both in Chicago and San Francisco. All in all one of the nicest human beings I have ever had the pleasure of interacting with.

I do a lot of things through GNS3 and realized it would be pretty cool if I could sim out some real world network issues and make it available to be troubleshot by anyone.

It would be a fairly large environment with ASA's, routers, and layer 3 switches with more than one AS and different kinds of site connectivity. Everyone would be able to SSH to any part of the environment and troubleshoot it, the only thing would be no one would have the ability to make changes as I will remove that. Not having configuration change ability will allow anyone to connect in and work on it and will also help simulate a production network where changes can't be cowboyed.

The answers would be available of course and there would be a few hints to help along the way. 

Thoughts?

Edit: Seems there is a lot of interest in this so I am going through with it. Here is what one of the WAN's would look like: http://i.imgur.com/JAtYNPC.png  AS100 would be the ""provider"" with a bunch of loopbacks emulating their subnets, along with some more eBGP peers up in that area to help sell that.

After consulting with both internal and outside technical experts, the root cause has been identified as a recent Apple Operating System update (version iOS 6.1) that many of us have downloaded and installed as we would routinely.   This issue is NOT unique to our company and is affecting all companies using Microsoft Exchange for mail and supporting Apple mobile devices.
 
In a nutshell, the problem is that even though you personally may not be an Apple user who accesses our email system with an iPhone or iPad, or you may not have downloaded and installed the iOS 6.1 release (like me), those Apple devices in our company that have installed the upgrade are causing havoc with our web mail servers.  There is a bug in the upgraded Operating System which prohibits Apple devices from communicating properly with Exchange, resulting in the Exchange mail servers becoming overwhelmed with redundant activity to the point that the servers can’t keep up and slow down or shut down for periods of time.
 
We, along with many other companies and technical experts (including Apple and Microsoft), are diligently working to find a solution.
 
In the meantime, recognizing that our efficiency out on the road will take a hit, we would request that Apple device users who have recently installed the upgraded iOS Version 6.1 limit their use of email services from those Apple devices as much as possible and to use web mail or VPN connections as much as possible until we can reach a resolution of this frustrating issue.

A little history about myself,

I am a 25 year old network professional. I started out at 18 working for a small multi-site company as part of a two-person IT department in a jack-of-all-trades role; although, my desire has always been in networking. Like a lot of you, I find great reward, you could say a high, in designing and supporting networks that meet business needs, big or small, and delivering success. Throughout my career I've had to learn many valuable lessons that I wish to share with you all.

I do not claim to be an expert in this field, in fact, I strive to work around people that are more seasoned than I, and where challenges are abundant, as that is where you will thrive and learn the most. A lot of these lessons I'm about to talk about may not even be new to you, however, I want this to be an act of giving back to a community that has given so much [knowledge].

So in proceeding, I'd like to break this down into three sections, Social, Business, and Technical Skills.

**Social**

In order to be successful, you will need to know how to interact and communicate with others effectively.

Whether you are a CEO, manager, or employee, you will at some point have to communicate with others, whether it be business, leisure, or personal matters, and if you want to be successful, regardless of industry, this is going to require strong interpersonal skills.

I grew up mostly introverted, shy, unwilling to break out of my shell no matter the situation. Over time, after much self-reflection and practice, I am beginning to come to the realization that speaking to others does not have to be a nerve-wrecking ordeal. Success, personal or business, requires the skill of expressing your thoughts and ideas, building relationships and rapport with those around you, and using communication as another tool in your arsenal. Don't be afraid to express your thoughts, but be smart about how you deliver them. Unless you are an asshole, if you are genuine and speak with conviction, people will notice and respect that. This includes speaking to your colleagues, managers, friends, family, strangers... anyone. With time, you will learn to open up, initiate conversations, adapt to different environments, and types of people.

Be patient with people, and yourself. 
Learn to respect others and be tolerant. 
Don't dwell on work related stress, these troubles will pass, as they usually do.
Don't be afraid to fail, find the confidence in yourself, because it *is* there.
Don't ever lose sight of your goals and never, ever give up on your dreams.

**Business**

Success in business begins with learning the right skills. These skills can be technical, social, business, and sometimes all three.

Technical skills get you in the door; social and business skills get you up the ladder.

Throughout my career I've noticed that aside from having technical skills, learning about the business in which you operate is key. I've learned that businesses, big or small, have objectives. Hone your technical skills and over time, if you've been challenged, you will learn what works and what does not; you will learn how to design networks based on best practices, develop processes, policies and procedures that work, and deliver services that your client will ultimately appreciate.

Learn to network with people, it won't hurt, and at best, will open up doors to new opportunities, opportunities that will hopefully test you, frustrate and break you, challenge and teach you, and build character.

**Technical**

In networking, I believe the most important lesson I've learned in becoming an effective engineer is not to just study and pass a test and claim to know enough to handle real-world situations, but to gain experience.

Technical certification exams can only teach you so much, and most of it will be forgotten if you do not utilize it in your day-to-day. I have to give credit to companies that have structured their exams around real-world situations and making the student think more about using their forces for good... if that makes sense. This means more than just memorizing commands and tidbits, it's about gaining the technical expertise and using it to empower businesses.

I believe the most important thing you need to understand in becoming a masterful network engineer are PROTOCOLS. Learn how they behave, learn how they are structured, learn how they operate INTRICATELY, learn their history! I cannot stress this enough. LEARN. PROTOCOLS. Examples include the almighty TCP/IP protocol, arguably one of the most important protocols you should know inside-out as a network engineer. Once you understand the dynamics of these logical processes, you will develop, over time, through years of sweat, blood, and tears, the ability to troubleshoot complex challenges with ease, or easier than those less knowledgeable. There are tools out there that allow you to delve as deeply as you'd like into protocol operation, tools that allow the visualization of communication between network entities at a very low level, that, if you learn to understand, will give you the upper-hand.

Learn to diagram! This is extremely important as an engineer. And I don't mean throwing together a willy-nilly diagram that no one but you can interpret. It will take time, but the more you diagram the better. Not only will it allow you to familiarize yourself with the program you use (Visio for me), you will learn what works and what doesn't. Over time, your diagrams will get better, they will be organized, structured logically, and if you're good, allow you to communicate complex ideas with simplicity. Keep a notepad with you while you work or blank paper, sketching out your thoughts when solving issues or needing to understand something complex, it makes life easier!

Learn to document! Seriously, I cannot count the amount of times I told myself I'd remember something, or said I would note it down later but never did and completely forgotten about it. Whether it be documentation for your company, or a personal knowledgebase for yourself, this will only help! Personally, I've been using Evernote to do this. It is free, robust, and accessible. Often times while solving an issue I will take the time during and afterwards to note the symptoms of the issue, steps I took to troubleshoot and their result, resolution, and resources that aided me such as website links. And trust me, if this is not done, you will encounter issues that you HAVE solved before, but so long ago that you forgot how you fixed it and even where you went to learn how to fix it; this sucks, so document and save yourself some time!

Never be afraid to leave your comfort zone. 
Learn to think outside the box.
Strive to learn something new every day! Even one thing is progress!

**Conclusion**

IT is an amazing field to get into that can be incredibly fulfilling if you are willing to put in the work. As with any field, you will most likely start at the bottom, but if you are dedicated, and truly have a passion for this, you can't go wrong. Some people will tell you networking is a dying field but that is so very, very wrong. The discipline of network engineering is a thriving one, and will be for some time. Networks are getting larger, demands for connectivity are growing, and competent, experienced professionals are always needed as long as you keep learning, earn your keep, and never lose sight of your goals.

I apologize for the rant, I just needed to get some things off my chest, if even one person learns something from this... success!

Thanks!

Daily simulated network issues for people to increase their networking knowledge,sepist,140,20,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1eefrf/update_interest_check_daily_simulated_network/,"Hey guys, I have an update for you on this project of mine!

Here is the network diagram as it stands now: http://i.imgur.com/9e2cK07.png

I had to pull out 2 ASA's that acting up, which ended up being an HSRP bug in GNS3, so I will add them back in soon. 

What I am looking for is people to test connectivity as it is now and let me know if there are any issues with connections. You should be able to telnet to any router from the two routers at the top, those are the entry points. The VTY's are configured for over 900 simultaneous connections but I've never seen more than a few utilized so I'd like to verify that this will work. Once I've figured out that all is working so far I'll start working on lab lessons and adding more features as needed!

Basics:

- Telnet to 71.251.1.135 on port 8500 or 8501 to get to AS100
- All of the WAN routers have ""Public"" IP addresses (contained within this virtual network)and private IP's for their P2P links, but I did not list them on the diagram. You can use a certain command to find them out (hint: it starts with `show cdp`)
- All WAN routers utilize eBGP and iBGP
- DIST01 for both AS105 and 110 are utilizing NAT
- AS105 utilizes EIGRP, AS110 utilizes OSPF
- EDIT: Forgot! Use `show running-config view full` to see the config as I've disabled enable access to vty but allowed all other access.
- EDIT2: Credentials! Username: expert / Password: networking",,False,,t5_2qkaf,1368646798.0,,,True,t3_1eefrf,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1eefrf/update_interest_check_daily_simulated_network/,

I bound to her socket for some packet injection

I saw her adapter was in promiscuous mode!

As it was just noticed a short bit ago, we recently hit 10,000 subscribers. Wow! And in my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/rhqy1/a_message_from_your_moderators/) to the community, we talked about things that you'd like to see differently in how things were run and submitted. Well, the moderation staff has been bouncing ideas back and forth with each other, and came up with the following changes to the rule-set. If you have any comments, questions, concerns, or queries, please file a ticket with your help desk, and allow us at least 3-5 business days to get back to ignoring your statement.

**This subreddit allows:**

1) Enterprise level networking questions / troubleshooting / conceptual and academic topics

2) Broad or specific topic questions relating to Networking. Eventually we'll create a sidebar posting of, ""How do I/did you get into networking?""

3) If you do want to post a picture of something interesting that happened to you at work, make it a self post. We understand that it's really cool to see some 10x100gb network cards in action, or a router that's been online since the Berlin Wall fell. We just don't want these posts getting abused.

**We do not allow:**

1) Home networking topics, including base troubleshooting and purchasing ideas. (If you're asking which home router is the best, or why your internet is slow, /r/techsupport would be a better fit).

2) ""Funny"" meme-related pictures. Yes, I'm in ur routers stealin' ur bandwidths may be chuckle-worthy, but we don't think this is the place for it.

What's the difference between ""Enterprise"" and ""Home Networking"" topics? If your network doesn't have something that comes by default on a home router, we'll take it in enterprise level. We just don't want to troubleshoot why your Linksys WRT-54G doesn't hook up to your X-Box. Setting up a VPN on that thing? Have an interesting setup on your home network that involves a load balancer?  Sure, ask away.

The only post we're a bit unsure of is the ""I just received my CCXX, hooray!"" They're okay in moderation, but if they become a bit too annoying, we'll revisit the topic.

If you aren't sure, feel free to message the mods. As always, please upvote this so that others can see it, and remember that I gain no Karma from doing so.

Right now we are currently taking part in a competition to secure £5,000 in funding; we'd be able to buy some pretty cool upgrades with that amount of money.

In order to win we need people to watch our video on youtube. So I'd like to propose that in exchange for 1 minute and 30 seconds of your time, I will answer any questions you may have about LAN parties, retell stories or maybe get some feedback/discussion about my network, I designed the network when I was a CCENT.

My back is against the wall at the moment, so I am reaching out to the community hoping to find some help.  I have a situation where my network is broken, and the network admin we hired to set the network up has completely checked out.  The issue as far as I understand it is our core routers are not forwarding arp requests between the attached switches.  This obviously is causing a big problem.  If there is anyone who is available for some consulting, I need help, big time, please message me.  I am located in the Silicon Valley, you could come on site, or work remotely.  
My apologies if this is not the type of post you want on this reddit. 

Edit: [here is a layout of our current infrastructure.](http://imgur.com/Ex9vSxI)   There are two segments, the one at the top, connected to the internet via two 7600, they are running VTP, which in turn is being received by a vtp client on the 6905s, which pushes the vlans out to it's switches.  Everything works fine internally on the servers connected to the switches on the 7600 series router.  The problem is the servers connected behind the 6905s, they are not exchanging arps at all with servers on the other switches(4948s).

EDIT:
Another one of our admins is jumping on this thread, he has more networking experience, and more clue.  Here is his post.  

Hi, I'm also involved in this thread. The configuration is there are two bridged networks basically consisting of two core networks. The second core (or middle core) aka two 6509's are running as VTP client and servers. They pull the vlans from network #1 and distribute them to network #2. Now the problem comes in with Xenserver. On the original network all we had to do was plug them into a dot1q port trunk and everything talked fine inside of VLANs. Now on the new network on the other side of the Cisco 6509's acting as both VTP clients and servers when we plug a Xenserver in there into a dot1q trunk they can't can only talk to servers that have cached their arp in core router that happen to be passing traffic to. So if an ARP address lives on core #1 and not on core #2 AND the the Xenserver is passing it's traffic first to core #2 then it can't see the server. The only situation it can see it is if we use ""arp -s ip.address mac.address"" on each side then both servers are visible to each other.
It looks likes a solution would be to add a VLAN interface on each core network with an IP address from the subnet assigned to that particular VLAN, but I am unsure if this will break anything.
Any thoughts?

Update: So we have knowledgeable admin who has stepped in and making things happen for us.  
Thank you so much for all your help and knowledge, I was immediately overwhelmed with all the follow up and suggestions as much of it was out of my scope, but we now have someone who can help us stabilize the environment.  Thank you, thank you!

I have a client who is trying to power a whole office with a partial T1 that is VPN'd to an office in San Diego.

I have no Juniper experience, but would like to give a weekly class on here about Cisco equipment.  

I'm not sure how to go about it, but maybe we can discuss it here, and come up with a good idea.  


My concerns:  
I am running GNS3 on a server currently, and can run an insane amount of routers (max I've tried is 20 right now, but can go more)  I don't want people to feel left out due to lack of a server.

IOS images.  They are different for everyone, and some machines will work better using different IOS versions. The router models I use in my GNS3 topology are for the 3600 and 3700.  I don't use anything else at the moment, and even try to stay away from the 3700 series at all costs, unless I'm doing MLS.  I have an image for the 3740, but it always causes a problem with saving in GNS3.

I cannot use the server or computer I work on to access Reddit, or record anything.  It is a work machine, and I use it while on break, but I cannot do very much outside of practice on it.  I can email myself configs and screencaps, but that is it.

Anyhow, let me know if you'd be interested.  Maybe we can get a good month of building in!! 


**EDIT:  For everyone to get on the same page, I want everyone to use the same IOS images.  I use 2 different routers in my GNS3 setup.  I use the 3700 series MLS (which I have extremely bad luck with... we will need to copy the config to a text document before shutting down GNS3.  It doesn't save it everytime) The image I will be using for the classes is c3745-adventerprisek9-mz.124-25a  so, if you have a vendor license grab it from Cisco.com.  Also, for the 3600 series router I use the image c3640-jk9s-mz.124-16.  These are optional, but they're the images i have had the best performance with.  And finally, visit GNS3.net and pick up the [image unpacker.](http://gns3.net/download) use this to uncompress the IOS image.  It will load quicker, and when we have 10 routers in the topology and you (accidentally / purposefully) hit the play button it won't kill your computer.**  We won't be using the 7200 series routers, but I might be able to give a small class later on that specific platform later if I have time.

Lets get started!

Why?

Let's say we both want an Orange (ip addresses) and one whole Orange is worth 100 addresses. Well get to the math later...

I only need 10/100 for my store, department, or home. You need 50/100 for your use. Why would both of us be allotted 100 slices each (2 oranges) when we can split(subnet) 1 orange into 2 pieces and share?

This is the idea of subnetting. It's taking a fraction of a whole to allow more people to be able to use them.

This is a game, and there are rules. Learn the rules, abide by them, and win the game.

numbering rules.

Every time I subnet I write this down on a piece of paper. ALWAYS.

* Subnet (/is slash) 24     25     26    27     28    29   30  31  32
* Host amount (#) 256   128     64    32     16    8     4    2   1 

* /24 matches with 256 hosts
* /25 matches with 128 hosts
* /26 matches with 64 hosts
* /27 matches with 32 hosts
* /28 matches with 16 hosts
* /29 matches with 8 hosts
* /30 matches with 4 hosts
* /31 matches with 2 hosts
* /32 matches with 1 host

*This is the last octet - Octet = 8 bits that make up your address.*

192.168.xxx.xxx That is the most familiar.

Each number set is equal to 8 bits, making a total of 32.

xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.xxxxxxxx.

We are starting with the last octet, we can get to the higher A and B class addresses later.

We will start with 192.168.0.0 This is our network address. On your router at home, this is most likely your address. 
We never use the network address. 
We use the first available address which is 192.168.0.1

Lets say you have 2 computers, 1 ipad, and xbox, a PS3, and your phone at home to connect to your network. You need a total of 6 hosts. 6 addresses need to be allocated to your network so that you can have an address for each host.

Well do this

* PC1 = 192.168.0.1
* PC2 = 192.168.0.2
* PS3 = 192.168.0.3
* XB  = 192.168.0.4
* Ipad= 192.168.0.5
* Ph  = 192.168.0.6
                                     
Is there really a need to sue 200+ addresses for 6 hosts? No.

So looking above at the chart I poorly made, you can see that 8 hosts need a /29 subnet. 

Key - Whenever you have your # of hosts - add 2 - One address for the network address, one for broadcast address... Network address is best-practice, the first address. 192.168.0.0 /24? Dont use the 0.0 - becasue that is your network address. Always left alone.

Have 13486 hosts? better make that 1348**8** because you always add 2 to make the network address work.

So our starting address is 192.68.0.0 /29 becasue we need 6 hosts+2 for network and broadcast.

We know where the network starts AND ends now.

* Start - 192.168.0.0 /29
* Ends - 192.168.0.8 (this is where the next address begins)

* First Usable Address - 192.168.0.1
* Last usable Address - 192.168.0.6



* I always make it look like this
* N0 (Network Zer0)                               - 192.168.0.0
* F0 (First usable for network Zer0)           - 192.168.0.1
* L0 (Last Usable for network Zer0)           - 192.168.0.6
* BC0 (Broadcast address for network Zer0)-192.168.0.7
* N1(This is where the next network Network1 Starts) - 192.168.0.8

* So -

* N0 - 192.168.0.0 /29
* F0 - 192.168.0.1
* L0 - 192.168.0.6
* BC - 192.168.0.7
* N1 - 192.168.0.8

Not only did I allocate exactly the amount of spaces needed, I also used the next address in case I have another network to be needed.

(Another best practice is to bump up to the next available, because lets say I use this addressing scheme for my home, and I buy my girl a ipad too) then I need 7 host addresses, but I dont have any available. Dam. Should have made it a /28 just in case.

* Re-Do

* N0 - 192.168.0.0 /28 (so 16 addresses are allowed now)
* F0 - 192.168.0.1
* L0 - 192.168.0.14
* BC - 192.168.0.15
* (Next Network)
* N1 - 192.168.0.16

This will ease up some space in case I go nuts with electronics.

First you'll need a DB9 to RJ45 adapter, I got a blank one here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067RSY/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1  $1.80 for a blank adapter, when it comes it will come with the pins out from the DB9 part.

2 - Black

3 - Yellow

4 - Brown

5 - Green (could also try red, they are crimped together on the one I took apart)

6 - Orange

7 - White (possibly grey)

8 - Blue

Connect pins FULLY into adapter until they click, twist DB9 plug to shorten cables and seat in adapter, plug USB to Serial adapter and Cat5 in from the Cisco device and you're ready to drop some configs.

Advisory — D-root is changing its IPv4 address on the 3rd of January.


This is advance notice that there is a scheduled change to the IPv4
address for one of the authorities listed for the DNS root zone and
the .ARPA TLD. The change is to D.ROOT-SERVERS.NET, which is
administered by the University of Maryland.

The new IPv4 address for this authority is 199.7.91.13

The current IPv6 address for this authority is  2001:500:2d::d and it
will continue to remain unchanged.

This change is anticipated to be implemented in the root zone on 3
January 2013, however the new address is currently operational. It
will replace the previous IP address of 128.8.10.90 (also once known
as TERP.UMD.EDU).

We encourage operators of DNS infrastructure to update any references
to the old IP address, and replace it with the new address. In
particular, many DNS resolvers have a DNS root “hints” file. This
should be updated with the new IP address.

New hints files will be available at the following URLs once the
change has been formally executed:

http://www.internic.net/domain/named.root

http://www.internic.net/domain/named.cache

The old address will continue to work for at least six months after
the transition, but will ultimately be retired from service.

Title	Out-of-Cycle Security Bulletin: Junos: Crafted TCP packet can lead to kernel crash
Products Affected	This issue can affect any router running Junos OS 7.6R1 or later configured with open TCP ports (eg. telnet, SSH, BGP, etc.) allowing incoming TCP connections to reach the RE.
Platforms Affected	
JUNOS 12.x
Security
JUNOS 11.x
JUNOS 10.x
SIRT Security Advisory
Revision Number	1
Issue Date	2013-01-30

PSN Issue : 
The Junos kernel may crash when a specifically crafted TCP packet is received by the Routing Engine (RE) on a listening TCP port. TCP traffic traversing the router will not trigger this crash. Only TCP packets destined to the router itself, successfully reaching the RE through existing edge and control plane filtering, will be able to cause the crash. This issue can be triggered by both IPv4 and IPv6 TCP packets destined to the RE. 

This issue was found during internal product security testing. 

The Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. 

This issue only affects devices running Junos OS 7.6R1 and later. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. 

Solution: 
All Junos OS software releases built on or after 2013-01-17 have fixed this specific issue. Releases containing the fix specifically include: 10.4S12, 10.4R13, 11.4R6-S1, 12.1R4-S3, 12.1R5, 12.2R2-S2, 12.2R3, 12.3R1, and all subsequent releases (i.e. all releases built after 12.3R1). In addition, all JTAC Recommended Releases listed in KB21476 have been updated to include this fix. 

Customers can confirm the build date of any Junos OS release by issuing the command 'show version detail'. 

This issue is being tracked as PR 839412 and is visible on the Customer Support website. 

KB16765 - ""In which releases are vulnerabilities fixed?"" describes which release vulnerabilities are fixed as per our End of Engineering and End of Life support policies. 

Workarounds 
The impact of the specially crafted TCP packet successfully making it's way to a listening port on the RE is a kernel crash and switchover (or reboot on single RE systems). 

Standard security best common practices (BCPs) can be employed, using access lists or firewall filters deployed on both the edge and control plane in combination with source address anti-spoofing, and where applicable, TTL security mechanisms to significantly reduce the risk of malicious exploit by limiting access to the router only from valid, trusted hosts. Features like uRPF and TTL Security (see sample macro below), or simply applying input firewall filters at the peering interfaces which discard traffic sourced from internal prefixes, will aid customers in protecting their network from remote attacks relying on spoofed source addresses. Note that while it's possible to use source routing to bypass uRPF, source routing is disabled by default in all recent Junos releases.

Solution Implementation: 
How to obtain fixed software: 

Security vulnerabilities in Junos are fixed in the next available Maintenance Release of each supported Junos version. In some cases, a Maintenance Release is not planned to be available in an appropriate time-frame. For these cases, Service Releases are made available in order to be more timely. Security Advisory and Security Notices will indicate which Maintenance and Service Releases contain fixes for the issues described. Upon request to JTAC, customers will be provided download instructions for a Service Release. Although Juniper does not provide formal Release Note documentation for a Service Release, a list of ""PRs fixed"" can be provided on request.

I'm trying to study the OSI model and although I think I have something of an understanding, ultimately the whole thing is a bit fuzzy. 

I wanted to ask, what is the one thing that allowed you to really understand what the model is all about and how it operates?

I admit I dont have a clue about layers 5,6 and 7. 4 is pretty mysterious to me as well. 

My basic understanding is that networks operate by first sending coded electrical impulses through the physical media (layer 1) device to device through the use of frames. Embedded in these frames are the source and destination MAC addresses that tell each device where each frame came from, and to who it should be going to next. (Layer 2). Now as these frames are picked up by routers, they ""dig in"" to the packet inside the frame and look for the IP address in it, and the routers try to find a path to send the frame along to another device to get it closer to its destination IP(Layer 3). They then overwrite the original source and destination MAC addresses and continue on sending the packets to different devices (again Layer 2). and then there's something about ports.. and then it all becomes fuzzy.
 
I won't even pretend to understand anything about or above 4. and I'm pretty sure that there's a lot of stuff that overlaps (like how routers have to overwrite the layer 2 MACs by examining layer 3 packets) on other layers that I probably do not understand or have caught on to yet. I originally thought the model was very static but after learning about that i understood that it can be a bit more complicated than that.

I would appreciate if you fellows could help me go off in the right direction or tell me what is a good thing to look at to help me understand better.

**About me:**  
I'm a low-level sysadmin, and I don't fully understand how everything works. I know a fair bit, but I'm looking for clarification from people who actually know how this stuff works.
  
**Background Info:**  
  There is a SOPA-like bill in Canada right now called Bill C-30.  One of the provisions of the bill is that your ISP will be able to hand over your information to law officers with no warrant. Things like e-mails, banking info, surfing habits etc. 

**What I'd Like to Know:**
   Can this actually be done? If my gmail works through https, as does my banking, can my ISP actually see anything I do there? I would assume that they would know that I connected to gmail or Royal Bank, but they won't be able to get any information as to what I'm doing. Is that correct?  Does the same thing apply for any SSL connection? 
  
I also assume that anything done over regular http is up for grabs. My Reddit browsing, porn habits, tech information. If that's the case, is there any way to secure the entire thing (without going through a VPN)?  Is there some sort of software one can run?

Thanks for your knowledge! :) 

**EDIT:** 

  It seems that the consensus is that my ISP can't see what I'm doing on an SSL connection unless they go to a lot of trouble and perhaps breaking a few laws. 

  To be clear: I'm trying to protect myself as the new Bill has a very broad reach and vague wording. If it was specifically worded to target Child Pornographers, I'd have no problem with it. However, it gives police the ability to look at ANYONE they want. If I happen to piss off the wrong police officer at a traffic stop, I could be targeted.

In the last 18 hours I made an unauthorised change to our enterprise network, took out our entire Japan office's phone systems, and got called back in at 3am to fix it.

Ok so some backstory... I am responsible for about half of the networks in my region (asia pacific). We are about to roll out a new voice network in our Sydney office. This is to enable SIP connectivity from our aging Alcatel PBX to the global Avaya system in Singapore. So I had an ip address range assigned to our site (a /21, with a /25 for each floor) by our global networks team, and I configured the first interface on our mpls edge firewall.

I have a change request logged for next weekend to actually move the PBX to the new network. I thought I'd save time by having a few pieces in place before we started.

Turns out that was a bad idea... The first /25 we were assigned was already in use in our Japan office. And as OSPF worked its magic, all their traffic started coming to us.

I knocked out their system for about 8 hours.

And of course now questions are being asked as to why a change request was not logged and approved beforehand.
I'm not too worried at this point. My Boss and his boss are pretty reasonable people. Maybe I get written up with a warning. I guess I deserve that.

So this is just a cautionary tale. Don't even do the changes you see as zero impact without logging a change request if it's in a production system.

Don't trust what other people tell you about network topology. If I'd looked at our routing table before implementing the interface I would have seen the network already existed. Instead I took their word for it that the range assigned was free.

With all the talk of bgp on here being a bit scary on here I propose we start a BGP learning environment.

Basically we start a private reddit peering network. Like something in spirit of https://dn42.net/.

The idea is people setup a home router either cisco, vyatta, qugga, juniper etc and connect up to one another over gre tunnels then bgp peer using a private AS number and advertise a /24. In the process we can teach one another about BGP and other technologies. Also the darknet people may be interested.

The vyatta and qugga solutions are easy as they are free and can be run in a VM.

I think the term ""auto negotiate"" inspires assumptions about its operation. However, in order for ""auto"" negotiation to work you need both sides set to auto. You can't set one side of the link to ""auto"" and another to, lets say, 100 Full Duplex. The ""auto"" side, in this case, wont ""automatically"" negotiate to 100 Full. If both sides are NOT auto the interface that is set to auto will always, 100% of the time, be in half duplex. It doesn't have anything to do with vendor interoperability either. An interface set to auto-negotiate sends Fast Link Pulses (FLP)s on the wire. If an auto-negotiating interface does not hear FLPs from the other side it cannot determine duplex so it will default (by spec) to half-duplex. The speed can be detected however but not duplex.

* Auto + Auto = Full Duplex
* Half + Auto = Half Duplex
* Full + Auto = Half Duplex
* Full + Full = Full Duplex

As you may know, The government of Iran censors its interwebz at the ISP-level, this makes accessing facebook, twitter, youtube impossible, since it will be redirected to a blockpage.

On top of that, access some sites that are not blocked by the ISP is not possible to access due to US Trade agreements, since the IP you are coming from is Iranian, and we all know about the sanctions..

So the people of Iran can only rely on proxy's and VPN to surf the web hassle free, TOR works, but there are not enough relay's close to that region, the average delay to facebook with VPN connected to Germany, Sweden, UK, and US is about 300ms, each of them, imagine what TOR would be like.

In Iran, some ISP's, not all have been using DPI firewall (Deep packet inspection) To identify and close encrypted Internet traffic.

Since Proxy/socks5v/PPTP/OpenVPn/L2TP/SSH/HTTPS is using encryption, the connection is almost immediately terminated.

UDP or TCP or using uncommon ports wont make any difference.

I've tried OpenVPN with certificates, TCP and UDP, on 6598 port, and tried without cert files, and using pre-shared key, both TCP and UDP, same port. Did not connect.

PPTP, wont connect. 6 months ago since i started it it has been working.

TOR Obfsproxy is not an option.

I've access to my own server located in Europe. And the only reason i do this is so I can call my cousins, uncles, family on skype. Because currently, I can't reach them. This information about this problem is based on tests that me and my cousins have been doing.

So please does anyone have any idea? I've access to my own server located in Europe, both Linux and Windows.

The expensive part would be getting the bandwidth required to do this I know we pay 700$/m for an unmetered 100mbit line from an ISP here so getting 1000mps or 10GE would cost a fortune... At that price if you were to resell 10mbit wireless for 40$ you wouldn't even break even and that is not including operating costs. 

What I am basically asking is how you go about cutting out an ISP that sells mainly residential stuff and go about purchasing directly from a tier 2 provider.

We have 30 racks for our equipment. Some are nearly empty, others are quite full. The current top-of-rack network is being replaced.

We ordered some hardware and I'm in the process of configuring the switches. But as I read and learn I realize that my initial plan may not be the best plan. I'm looking for tips and resources.

*My biggest hurdle is not knowing what I don't know.*

**The original plan:**

*Hardware*

30x Dell Force10 S55 1 GigE switches with a single 10 GigE module.

2x Dell Force10 S4810 10 GigE switches.

*Design*

A single S55 per rack with 2x 10 Gig ports connected to the S4810s. (the S4810s are stacked). 


**Questions:**

Does this make sense? Everything is on a single subnet as there's pretty little traffic as is. 

Is a star topology the best way to configure this equipment?

Assuming we stick with the star I'm assuming I need to setup the 10 gig ports in LAG (port-channel in FTOS)?

Do I need to setup STP? (I know what this is, but I have no idea how I'd set it up if I need to).

As you can see, I am having difficulty as I don't know what I should be looking up. Any direction is appreciated.


**Additional Information**

Sorry for leaving out the use case. Here it is:

The type of traffic on this network will be mostly management (iDRAC, RDP, SSH). We'll also use it for PXE installs and some file share transfers.

We work on a project basis where we'll assemble the servers &amp; SAN for something specific, set it up, and do our analysis. The software we work with generally needs a separate dedicated network and we have a separate fabric for the SAN. So any intensive traffic will be on a different network than this one. 

This network does not have access to the outside world and the room needs your badge swiped to get it so security isn't really an issue. And even if something happened where we lost everything, we wouldn't really lose anything (if that makes any sense).

The site: A big campus network with around 900 increasingly elderly Cisco switches. 10/100 to the desk with Gigabit uplinks between the switches. Traditional core/dist/access model with first-hop routing happening at the distribution layer and layer 3 between core and dist. We're not doing anything particularly clever; it's all IPv4 running OSPF with lots and lots of VLANs.

We need to replace pretty much everything as a) we want Gigabit to the desk and 10Gig core/dist, and b) nearly all of it's past end-of-life. Oh, and c) we want to do host authentication (eg, 802.1x) with dynamic VLAN assignment to simplify moves/adds/changes.

Cisco has a great story for where we can go from here but it's eye-wateringly expensive, some of it's based on technology that's not fully available yet and we've been burned so many times by Cisco's ""Oh, you wanted *that* functionality as well? You'll need to spend another 20K in licenses. HTH!"" bullshit that we're all a bit tired of them. On the oher hand, we all know IOS very well and are very comfortable with it.

Juniper also has a great story that is both more straightforward, all available today and much more reliant on industry standards than Cisco's proprietary stuff. Nice kit by the looks of it and a price/performance that's amazing compared to Cisco. But the cost in terms of building new Junos skills and finding the hidden gotchas is going to be substantial.

If you've done this kind of change, what was your experience? How hard was it to go from IOS to Junos? What's the troubleshooting like on it? How much use are Virtual Chassis in real-life (they look great on paper)? What are the downsides of Juniper? Anything important we'd need to know in advance?

TL;DR: Big Cisco campus site looking to move to Juniper. Good idea or disaster in the making?

first off, i should mention that we peer with three providers for internet access. we provide internet circuits to around five hundred customers.

started getting calls this morning about internet speeds slowing down to a crawl. using route view servers, we found that we were getting hung up on PROVIDER A. trace routes seemed to stop at different IP addresses throughout their autonomous system.

shut down their session and our internet speeds greatly improved. we started getting calls back from customers that speeds have resumed.

while on the line with PROVIDER A, we saw the same problem happen again, this time through another provider. it wasn't until this time that i checked our eBGP peer utilization and saw that it was receiving a full gig of internet traffic from PROVIDER B. at that time it became obvious as to what was happening.

we isolated the target on our network and shut down their interface connecting to us. they have a 200 Mb/s circuit, but the tech that provisioned it forgot to add a policy and so it was pushing a full gig.

we contacted the customer, informed them of what we saw and why we shut them down. they confirmed that their firewall was discarding all of the traffic; good news for them, not for me. i added the policy to limit their bandwidth, and brought them back up.

we are currently monitoring their connection, and if the need is there we will shut them down again.

Just as the title explains.  I work for one of the many large cloud computing providers as a Network Engineer.  I've interviewed hundreds of candidates in my time at the company and noticed a few things.  For one, candidates are all around nervous (and understandably so).  Second, most candidates tend to get really stumped when I ask practical questions or ""soft skill"" questions.

I'm wondering if anyone who's either trying to find a job in the Networking field, or anyone who just wants to sharpen their interviewing/tech skills would find this helpful.

If anyone has any questions feel free to comment or PM me.

EDIT: Didn't expect this much of a quick turn around, awesome guys!  So something I should add to this whole thing is just interviewing in general, not necessarily just technical questions.  I'd be happy to list some of the questions I ask and what I look for, but overall that's not always super helpful depending on how long you've been in the industry.

I also should have prefaced with this, what kind of experiences (technical, non-technical, stupid questions, questions you stumbled on, etc.) have you had with tech interviews.  What a lot of people sometimes don't understand walking out of an interview they think they bombed, is just because they have a CCIE doesn't mean they know how to interview.  If you think that, you're dead wrong.

EDIT #2: Keep the questions coming for now, anything and everything - I'll likely look into doing the practice runs next week for those who are interested.  First come first serve, I'm also not sure how many I'll be able to do but I'll always answer questions via here or PM.

EDIT #3: **Okay, so I think the best way to do this is through PM's, so if you're interested please send me a PM.  Give me a rough outline of your experience, how long you've been in the industry, what you want to try and get out of this (specific topics, general interviewing skills (soft skills), or just an all around normal interview with my normal).  I don't want to end up ""interviewing"" an entry level individual for a more ""senior position"" or it'll just murder their confidence - so please don't embellish.**",,False,,t5_2qkaf,1376438184.0,,,True,t3_1k9frg,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1k9frg/would_anyone_be_interested_in_mockpractice/,

I'm in charge of a project to get the housing cooperative I live in hooked up to a fiber line, so all the apartments have access to fiber Internet, instead of the slow phone lines we use now.

I've come pretty far in the process, and have gotten a really attractive offer from a company that has its own fiber lines in the ground, here in the east of Copenhagen (Denmark).

There's one thing I'm not sure about, though, and that is what type of wiring is best for wiring the apartments up to the switches that are connected to the fiber line.

The offer I've received suggests Cat 5E, but I know this is limited to 1 Gbit, and although that seems like a lot right now, I'm hoping we will exceed that within the next decade or two. Almost the entire cost of getting everything set up is in wiring the apartments. It's around 3300 DKK per apartment (~$500), and I'm thinking it may be wise to chose a cabling rated for 10 Gbit, now that we're at it anyway.

At the same time I know how fast technological progress is, and that this might prove to be completely unnecessary in 10 years, because something else (like wireless) will be more attractive, or because we will have figured out a way to push 10 Gbit through a Cat 5E cable by then.

As far as I can see, Cat 6A is around 3-5 times as expensive as Cat 5E, but given that each apartment probably has an average cabling distance to the router of around 50 meters, [it won't cost more than $65 bucks for 50 meters of Cat 6A cabling or so \(at most\)](http://www.discount-low-voltage.com/Cable/Cat6A-Ethernet-Cable/6UA124UTP-11W), which isn't much when compared to the total cost of around $500 per apartment.

I'm interested in getting some input on this though. What are your thoughts? Is it a no-brainer to go with Cat 6A, at the added cost, or is it a waste - and why?

I'm purposefully ignoring fiber cabling for the apartments as this will require a box in each apartment that converts the optical signal to an electrical Ethernet signal, making it too expensive.

Earth shattering results? Not so much in my opinion. 802.11n 5GHz 40MHz can provide some excellent results and is quite stable. AC over the long term will get us closer to cutting the cord, but right now isn't the time.

You can purchase a Intel 7260-AC WLAN for around $40 (check if your laptop can support it). My HP Elitebooks definitely did not like the card, but most of the Dell's I've tried don't complain.

I picked up the USB3.0 Edimax AC and D-Link AC adapter.

In addition, I have to continue getting more certifications within 3 years to keep the previous ones valid. 


So I guess I'm just overwhelmed and it looks like it's a road of 3 steps forward and 2 steps back and I'm starting to wonder if the certifications are really worth all of the upkeep, if they're simply a means to get the job, or if I'm better off looking for an entry-level or internship job and just amassing experience.

1.  If most communication happens over IP, a L3 protocol.  Why do bother filtering L2?  Aside of course from ISP's that want to prevent me from printing dirty pictures on my neighbor's printer.  Is there any other time it's useful?

2. How the heck do switches filter the frames anyway?   Is it some kind of ACL for Ethernet?  Would it work on token ring?

3.  Is this statement true?
a) PC on community port sends a frame.
b) Switch tags frame with secondary vlan id, floods same community, including out a trunk
c) Switch2 receives frame, looks at tag,  has ports in the community, looks at destination mac, floods out community ports, receives responce.

A 32/128 bit addressing junkie?  Master of all things with lots of blinky lights?  You'll need a couple of things to start this journey:

* Genuine interest in technology and computing (its not about the money)
* Committing yourself to **never stop learning**
* A realization that it is a long, stressful road to becoming a network engineer
* Patience, you're going to be working with and supporting a lot of people of varying skills and social levels

So you've got those, let's get started!

1.  **Go to College:** Some people skip this step, but it's honestly the only sure fire way to get a job in networking.  You need the credentials a degree provides in today's world to get your foot in the door.  Look at getting a two or four year degree, with an internship at some point. 

2.  **Get a Helpdesk Job:** Everyone starts in Helpdesk. This is where you gain a lot of confidence, patience, experience, and most importantly: your first battle scars.  You need to find out the hard way that you don't know everything by causing a massive fuck up.  It humbles you and makes you more conscious of what you're doing and how it can impact things.  While you're working help desk, try to help out your superiors in any way possible.  Also, you should be working on getting at least your Network+ and CCNA.  Why Net+?  It's a really well rounded certification that covers a lot of ideas that are very vendor neutral.

At this point you have two options.  Stick around at your current company or jump ship.  I would say jump ship, as most help desk people will work at that job forever without a lot of advancement.  Either way, you want to move up to a:

3.  **Junior Administrator:** Why an administrator?  You want to be in networking?  You need server experience.  The more knowledgeable about servers you are, the more of an asset you are to your team.  Hopefully you picked up a lot of stuff on servers from your help desk position, but if not its probably a good idea to work on getting a Microsoft cert of some kind. You should also be collecting used Cisco equipment for your home lab.  You're going to need it for your CCNP, and companies will typically give old stuff away. 

4.  **Junior Network Engineer:** This title has many names, but it typically means entry-level network job.  This could be at the same company as your last job.  This job will give you a lot of networking related bitch work to do, but that's what you need.  Between looking over configs and working in your home lab, you should have enough experience/knowledge to get your CCNP.  The company should be able to pay for it too.  

Once you have your CCNP, it's descision time.  You can stay in the corporate IT world or move into consulting.  Consulting will pay better and fast track you into network engineer/architect role quite quickly at the cost of a social life and an enormous amount of stress.  Its also somewhat harder to get back into corporate IT from a consulting role.  Regardless, your next job should be a full blown network engineer.   

One thing you'll eventually need to think about is what specialty you'll bring into the table/focus on.  I think Cisco breaks it down the best:

* Routing and Switching
* Voice/Unified Communications
* Security
* Wireless
* Storage and data center

Having a specialty makes you more important and gives you an ace in the hole for jumping jobs.

I'll start.

We had a load-balancer switch where one port in the LACP pair was running at maximum, and other was basically not used at all (downstream).

By analyzing the flows I found out that most of this traffic was going to two machines, whose name only differed in the end -01 and -02. We had another load-balancer switch just two racks away, so I made a ticket to have one machine moved to the other switch so the load would be split.

Since both switches were clearly load balancer switches I didn't bother to check the one one server was moved to. 

Some time later I get a call from our head of data center networks asking me if I'd seen the mail about the 'network problems' which was basically send to the whole company. I hadn't, but I sure knew the servers they were talking about.

Turns out, the switch I had the server moved to was an old switch with 100Mbit access ports. You can all imagine how good a load-balancer works at 100Mbit...

I later found out both servers were pulling data from the same source system whose switch had src-mac set as hashing algorithm, so the source of the problem was never at the receiving end of the connection.

Currently, we have two Cisco 72xx routers. One went down today, and my supervisor finally understands what I mean when I say that the routers have never worked at the same time-- making the redundancy almost pointless.

Because of the router age(s), we're investigating getting a replacement edge router. My supervisor is *relatively* cheap and has a ""Get 'er Done"". He's recommended moving to a couple 73xx's from Ebay for less than $500 each. It looks much better than the 72xx, but I'm unsure about firmware-- although I'll investigate that more if we decide to pursue the 73xx routers.

**Official Requirements**

 * WAN is only a single &lt;100Mbps Fiber line. We're investigating bringing in additional fiber lines for redundancy (this has been done previous-- before my time here).
 * BGP is configured. We have a decent allocation of IPv4 addresses from ARIN.
 * Traffic is relatively low (less than 15Mbps before Feburary, ~30-35Mbps lately, ~12Mbps of traffic will be moving out in August). The traffic jump is unusual and we're still investigating why (several things).
 * We'd prefer having redundant  hardware available (either in a fall-over configuration or manual switchover). Redundant power is good as well.
 * The 72xx only had 512MB of Memory (Max supported by the NPE), I have already previously pointed out our memory usage approaching 85% within the years end, and 95% by next year. 
 * Network Layout is very simple. Theoretically, everything should be in its own VLAN, but it isn't. Everything on this router goes off one FastEthernet port.

**Unofficial Desires**

* IPv6. Enough Said?
* Internal BGP/OSPF/RIP/Something. Everything is currently 'static' or with this router as the gateway (several dozen addresses). Unfortunately, any solution would be looking at either wasted addresses or really small subnets (up to /32)
* Up-to-date firmware.

**About Us**

So, for anyone still with me. We're not really a Cisco shop. 

I'm sure we like telling our clients that our network runs on a Cisco routers. 

We're mostly a Linux shop-- with several Windows servers as well. We just switched our internal router to some Vyatta-based hardware (I have previous experience with Vyatta, the switchover has been really good). 

Our team is pretty good at picking things up. 

Ultimately, I'd consider anything that fits, but my I need to convince my supervisor that its worth it.

**Questions**

I'm not familiar with all of the available routers and series-- especially once you start including EOL models. Is 73xx a good bang for the buck? Should I push for some 72xx NPE upgrades instead? Or is there another vendor/model we should consider? 

I'm unsure of all the active redundancy options available on the routers. Memory is a slight concern as well. The BGP tables of this router were getting quite large and I was pretty hesitant to add dynamic routing, IPv6, or much of anything to it. Would redundancy options include hooking one fiber line to each router, both fibers to both routers, or something else?

**tl;dr**

Supervisor/Boss is cheap. We need one or more edge-like router(s) that can utilize:

* Full BGP (with multiple fiber lines, later)
* Internal dynamic routing (currently unimplemented)
* IPv6 (not on the official agenda).

There's a [list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_to_the_premises_by_country), but saying that ""it's an available option"" isn't the same as ""it's available for most customers at regular prices"". I know for a fact that a number of these countries mentioned as having FTTH/FTTB don't actually offer it at an affordable price or in the majority of the country (some even still offer 512Kbps, and the max speed of 4Mbps!!), or offer it only for commercial use.

I'm in the process of finding out how to establish a common internet infrastructure that is shared between the tenants of the two apartment buildings that are part of the housing cooperative I live in.

So far the propositions we have received all suggest that we get a ~~1 Gbit~~ (**EDIT:**) 10 Gbit fiber connection into the basement of one of the apartment buildings, which is split by either three or four switches placed in the basements of the two buildings. Wiring will be laid in the buildings to that an Ethernet cable, which is connected to a switch in the basement, will enter each apartment.

One difference between the various propositions is that some recommend we simply share the entire ~~1 Gbit~~ (**EDIT:**) 10 Gbit between all tenants, and the equipment will make sure that all tenants get their fair share. Another solution proposed is that each tenant has an individual subscription, that gives him or her an internet connection of X/X mbit.

Discussing the choice between these two choices, one person pointed out that it's actually not that simple to share a connection equally between people. I've researched the subject myself, and came to the conclusion that I can't, for example, seed torrents at full speed on my current connection, without limiting the speed greatly, mainly because of buffers at my ISP. They will get filled up with outgoing data, and the subsequent requests I send will go to the back of the queue, and my response time will be high. It's all explained here: http://www.bufferbloat.net/

Is this applicable to the solution that I'm seeking, ie. a sharing of a ~~1 Gbit~~ (**EDIT:**) 10 Gbit internet connection between 200 people? What type of equipment would we need to get to absolutely guarantee that each tenant has at least 50 Mbit of capacity at any time? What would this type of equipment cost?

I hope you can help to answer some of these questions, as I'm not that knowledgable when it comes to networking. But I've volunteered for this project as a high speed internet connection has been my wet dream for a long time, and having the opportunity of making this come true is too good to pass by.

Using this command I have been able to tell an ISP about an issue on there network with a device that had a 30-50% packet loss that they were apparently unaware off.

The primary purpose of doing this is to provide Internet to the locals (specifically, school age children) of the village on the island.  However, the plan (of course, with no research done by management) was that it will be funded by charging a modest fee to tourists.

Some background on the island: there is currently no wired phone or Internet service.  There is no power link with the mainland; most houses and businesses on the island only have power each night when they run their generators from around 6 to 10pm.  I'm not worried about powering the equipment during the day, though, as we already have a solar solution figured out.

The big question is the Internet service itself.  Clearly the only answer is satellite service.  However, when Googling for possible services, it is hard to find which ones are worldwide or which ones cater to just a specific country (like the US or Canada).

Does anyone have any information or recommendations on satellite Internet services that would be available in SE Asia?  I'm less worried about overall bandwidth and more worried about transfer caps -- for tourists we will use heavy QoS restrictions to cap each connection at a certain speed, and probably block data intensive services like YouTube.  But it wouldn't be prudent to outright block Facebook (specifically Facebook photo uploads, for example, which would be the #3 reason for tourists to use the service after email and Facebook in general), and a few hundred tourists a week uploading some pics here or there may hit the cap pretty quickly.

I'm kind of disappointed because in the US, you can get satellite service for as cheap as $50'ish per month, and while it may be a little spotty, and at that price we wouldn't mind paying for multiple accounts and using them in unison or just switching over when one hits the cap.  But I'm fairly sure those services aren't available worldwide. :(

So, in general, any ideas/thoughts/suggestions/etc would be greatly appreciated.  Let me know if you need any more detail.

**edit:** Some good information here, but also some people going way overboard.  Maybe I should be more clear as to the background of the community.  There is not a single local on the island that owns a computer, or has likely ever used the Internet.  The 'island' is really just a single beach, with a dozen or so huts on it.  We aren't going to wire huts because they are huts and no one has computers or will likely ever be able to afford them.  We don't need our own IP space, we don't need to be a set up like an ISP.  If you've never been to remote SE Asia then you probably have no concept as to the squalor that we are talking about, and how overboard some of these solutions sound.

We need something for locals to learn what email is and use it to contact family members off-island.  We need something for tourists (read: backpackers) that will be sufficient for eight or so terminals to be accessing pretty much only Facebook, email, and various travel guides online.  I appreciate the idea of ""doing it right"" but this is never going to be the basis of some wider regional island backbone, nor are there more communities on the island for this to spread to.  In fact, the government is scheduled to bulldoze everything in 6-8 years to turn the island into a resort destination.  We just want to get the locals some basic computer skills before they are relocated.",,False,,t5_2qkaf,True,,,True,t3_nz8go,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/nz8go/tasked_with_providing_internet_to_a_remote_island/,

Throw-away, cuz anonymity.

I've been in the IT/networking industry for 6 years.  I started off in a helpdesk/tech support role for a third-party ISP and caught the networking bug there.  I have a good work ethic, strong logic/critical thinking skills, take pride in what I do.  I worked my way up from an entry-level gig to senior roles and management at a shitty company, and used the job experience to flip it into a well-paid, much better job at a much better company.

M first job 6 years ago I made between 39-42k depending on overtime, it was soul-crushingly awful at times due to that company's culture and policies, but I worked my ass off and grinded it out every day, and my primary focus has been getting paid better working for a company I like.

At this point, I feel like I've accomplished this goal.  I work for a Fortune 500 company, I like the people I work with, I like much more of the work I do, the company culture is fair (albeit sort of boring), it's a very stable industry/company, and last year I cleared 6 figures for the first time in my life.  At this point, I feel like I've achieved the goal I was working towards, of getting paid well (and not feeling like i'm being taken advantage of)  for a company I like with people I like.

The problem I'm now facing, and what I'd like to get some input on from all of you, is that I feel like for the most part all I do is work.  There is a ton of overtime built into my current position due to projects needing to occur after-hours, during maintenance windows, etc.  My impression of this industry is that this is common throughout, for similar reasons.  

Now, this is a very Operations-centric viewpoint because I've only worked in Operations roles, so I'm wondering - any of you have a gig that allows you flexibility to enjoy your life?  

**tl;dr**: I'm making the kind of money I want to be making now but work too much, my next goal is get some of my time back so I can actually live a little more than I am currently.

I consider myself to be a very experienced Network engineer(R&amp;S) with a well rounded background in many different 'I.T.' subjects.

(x-post r/Cisco)",dalgeek,42,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/18x1h3/how_a_cisco_asa_can_trigger_a_windows_ip_conflict/,"Situation: customer is setting up a Windows 2008 R2 server in a VMware cluster, on a VLAN that is sitting behind a firewall. The firewall is is the gateway for the VLAN (say 192.168.34.1). When configuring the network interface on the server, picking ANY IP address in the 192.168.34.0/24 network results in the error message “Windows had detected an IP address conflict”. This happens even if there are no other devices on the VLAN aside from the firewall.

The issue? There was a static (identity) NAT entry in the Cisco ASA firewall for 192.168.34.0/24. By default, Cisco firewalls will proxy ARP for NAT entries.

* (8.3(1), 8.3(2), and 8.4(1)) The default behavior for identity NAT has proxy ARP disabled. You cannot configure this setting.
* (8.4(2) and later) The default behavior for identity NAT has proxy ARP enabled, matching other static NAT rules. You can disable proxy ARP if desired.

This is desirable behavior for a firewall on the edge of the network because the upstream router needs to know where to send traffic for NAT’ed hosts. For internal firewalls this can cause issues, especially with 8.4 code where you need to setup identity NAT to exempt devices from NAT.

The solution? Add “no-proxy-arp” to the end of your identity NAT statements:

    nat (inside,outside) source static obj_Internal obj_Internal no-proxy-arp route-lookup

The other (less desirable) solution is to disable the ARP-checking functionality in Windows, but this means it won’t be able to detect a legitimate IP conflict.

When we can finally convince someone to test from their demarcation, sometimes they'll see 9.3 Mbps, and complain that it's not 10 Mbps, and they want us to fix their QoS.  Sometimes it can take awhile to explain overhead, but we recently had a customer who fought back and said overhead couldn't account for more than 1% of the overhead.  Realize also that we offer layer 2 connectivity services (VPLS, EVPL, etc.) and the customer will see this similar to a direct link between sites.


Doing the math, I accounted for TCP/IP/Ethernet encapsulation.


Regular Ethernet (non-802.1Q or jumbo frames) was used, and I found the encapsulation took up ~38 Bytes, with IPv4 at 16 Bytes (IPv6 is 36 Bytes), and TCP using another 16 Bytes.


Ethernet - 38

IPv4/IPv6 - 16/36

TCP - 16 (at minimum, there's padding techniques and options possible too).


Maximum Ethernet Frame size - 1538 Bytes (Includes the framing as 1500 Bytes is encapsulated by the frame.


IPv4 total overhead - 70 Bytes

IPv6 total overhead - 90 Bytes


I found that at the maximum, you can expect ~95% of your bandwidth to come through from your layer 2 bandwidth, which declines as you use smaller packets (important for people who bought layer 2 links to connect remote VoIP systems to their Head office PBX).

Thought some people might find it interesting or helpful, although I'm sure many of you knew this anyways.  It's nice to have hard numbers to look at for myself (and possibly others) also.

Let me know what you think, maybe there's more overhead or less, and I've done this a little wrong.

    DISCUSSION
    
       Twas the night before start-up and all through the net,
         not a packet was moving; no bit nor octet.
       The engineers rattled their cards in despair,
         hoping a bad chip would blow with a flare.
       The salesmen were nestled all snug in their beds,
         while visions of data nets danced in their heads.
       And I with my datascope tracings and dumps
         prepared for some pretty bad bruises and lumps.
       When out in the hall there arose such a clatter,
         I sprang from my desk to see what was the matter.
    
       There stood at the threshold with PC in tow,
         An ARPANET hacker, all ready to go.
       I could see from the creases that covered his brow,
         he'd conquer the crisis confronting him now.
       More rapid than eagles, he checked each alarm
         and scrutinized each for its potential harm.
    
       On LAPB, on OSI, X.25!
         TCP, SNA, V.35!
    
       His eyes were afire with the strength of his gaze;
         no bug could hide long; not for hours or days.
       A wink of his eye and a twitch of his head,
         soon gave me to know I had little to dread.
       He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
         fixing a net that had gone plumb berserk;
       And laying a finger on one suspect line,
         he entered a patch and the net came up fine!
    
       The packets flowed neatly and protocols matched;
         the hosts interfaced and shift-registers latched.
       He tested the system from Gateway to PAD;
         not one bit was dropped; no checksum was bad.
       At last he was finished and wearily sighed
    
    
    
    Cerf                                                            [Page 1]

    Twas the Night Before Start-up
    
    
         and turned to explain why the system had died.
       I twisted my fingers and counted to ten;
         an off-by-one index had done it again...

I help manage the network for a small cafe (Cafe Allegro) in Seattle.

I'm debating between finding a router capable of handling ~100+ concurrent connections and setting a whitelist for ports vs. trying some automated blocking of torrent-range ports.

Any suggestions for this kind of project? We're on a budget, but it's also a priority for us to not get booted due to copyright violations. I was looking into what DD-WRT can do these days (we used to have a WRT54g as the primary router+AP there before we installed OpenMesh, but it started failing under too much load), but I'm at a bit of a loss for where I should start looking and what approach I should employ.

This server, like all of the other virt servers, has each port of its dual-port 10G NIC linked back up to one of the two 10G switches that form the core of our network. When the host crashed, it bridged the NIC ports &amp; started sending out duplicate frames up both links to the 10G switches.

This broke the trunk that connected both 10G switches together, which resulted in the switches not being able to talk to each other. Which resulted in each switch actively trying to become the STP root, which cascaded into a whole other mess of problems with devices being unable to reach each other because that trunk between the two switches was dead.

It's pretty clear that the initial failure here, the hypervisor spewing the same frames out of each NIC port, is one of those ""THAT SHOULD NEVER FUCKING HAPPEN"" kind of problems -- but since it *did* happen, and it's an extremely disruptive failure mode, is there anything that can be done from the switching side to guard against this?

A customer called in complaining that after moving a device from a different network segment it no longer worked. As this device in particular controlled the environmental control system it was a fairly critical piece of equipment to get working. The change request was processed and kicked back to us citing end-user error/CPE as the root cause. This particular end user was quite adamant his equipment was fine and was just inspected so I dug in a little bit [some output cut]:

    interface FastEthernet1/0/10 
    switchport access vlan 300 
    switchport mode access  
    spanning-tree portfast 
    spanning-tree bpduguard enable 
    spanning-tree guard root 
    end

Well, the interface itself looks ok. I asked the customer to connect a laptop to this interface and try to ping back to the network. That failed, the customer couldn’t hit anything on the network, not the core switch, the local switch, nothing.

I had the thought to check the uplink port and found the culprit:

    interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1 
    description uplink port from switch 
    switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q 
    switchport trunk native vlan 100 
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 100,200,201 
    switchport mode trunk 
    switchport nonegotiate 
    end

vlan 300 wasn’t trunked through the uplink port.

“An easy fix!” I thought as I, in my arrogance, adjusted the running config without a change request.

    ClientSwitch(config)#interface gi1/0/1
    ClientSwitch(config-if)#switchport trunk allowed vlan 300

The switch dropped, my heart stopped.

“Perhaps it’s just STP convergence or my local session locked up.” I thought to myself as adrenaline started coursing its way though my veins. I opened a second terminal and tried to ping the switch.

Nothing.

I got on the phone with our local contact at the site and, without too much explanation, convinced him to reboot the switch.

After a bit of research and a quick trip to the lab, I came to the realization that without using the “add” modifier to the vlan command it overwrote all existing vlans and replaced them with only vlan 300. The correct command would have been

    switchport trunk allowed vlan add 300

At the end of the day everything was working, the client was happy, and despite a small blip production went largely unaffected.

If anyone could add additional names or product recommendations I'd really appreciate it.  Some of the service I need/want to provide:

* Unique security context per client

* Unique routing tables

* Customer self-management (the option)

* Full context specific monitoring and logging

* IPSEC termination



* SSL VPN termination

* IDS/IPS (I'm not a security professional so please be easy on me)

* HA (active/active or active/passive)

* Throughput requirements 500Mbps to multi-Gbps (long topic)

* Content filtering (optional billable service)

* Detailed application level reporting and control

I know there is tons of additional info I could add here but I'll save that for when I'm doing my homework later. Any opinions you can share would be appreciated.",,False,,t5_2qkaf,1353359855.0,,,True,t3_13ggna,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/13ggna/multitenant_firewall_options/,

I have (a year ago) completed 3 diplomas and a 4 year degree in computer information systems.

My current position is building hypervisor clusters and network deployments in the 500-1400 port range. In the past, I have supported Microsoft OCS and had a lot of exposure to VMWare and Cisco.

So, I find myself moving deeper into the network design and routing aspects. Given the position I am in, I can see the value in some directed training to further my product knowledge and technology knowledge.

So, should I spend the next year prepping for a CCIE? My current progress is 1/2 way through a CCNA and my current level of knowledge is approximately 2/3 through a CCNP.

I'm estimating it will take me 24 months of 20 hours a week to get to a level with the content that I would be confident attacking the CCIE-voice exam. 

I also think it would cost me about $7,000 for lab equipment to buy all the routers/switches/phone devices i would want to play with.

It would probably also cost me $5,000 in training books and exam fees, and then another $6,000 for a boot camp just before I go for the CCIE exam and $3,000 for travel expenses related to the boot camp and exam writing. 

So, $21,000 + 2000 hours = a reasonable shot at passing a CCIE. 

Do you think its worth it?

To the CCIE's out there: Did you directly notice a change inyour employment? The CCIE's who I have talked to basically spoke of endless travel and 330 nights a year away from home.

I have a VPS, and have set up a restrictive firewall. Currently, the only connections in the INPUT iptables chains that are being let through are a few services that I need access to (irc bouncer, ssh, and maybe a web server later on), and the entire ICMP protocol.

I'd like to ""plug"" ICMP, but i'm not sure if there are any parts of it that that help with connection tracking etc. I've seen the lists for [IPv4 ICMP](https://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters/icmp-parameters.xhtml) and [IPv6 ICMP](http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmpv6-parameters/icmpv6-parameters.xhtml), but I can't afford the time (at this moment) to read through that documentation. The one thing I remember, is that with IPV4, people with restrictive firewalls usually only drop ICMP type 8, and I never knew why that is :/

Specifically we were talking about something I wanted to try (meshing of MPLS-TE tunnels) using the auto-tunnel mesh functionality in Cisco and dynamic tunnels RSVP-TE within Juniper. He disagreed with me on using those and instead was pushing for more of an external means of setting those up (using scripts). Another one that came up was using the auto-bandwidth functionality for TE tunnels. One could use the router to make changes to the bandwidth statement or one could write a script that parses that information and manually sets the bandwidth. 

Either way, I'm not really sure where I would sit on that. On one hand, I really see a lot of promise in my friends' statement that one doesn't really trust the routers' software to make those changes. On the other hand, if that feature was put in there and kept in there then it must be worth some good right? On top of that....not everyone (myself) really knows how to do scripting. That's not to say I can't learn (I want to start doing ""Python the hard way"") but I guess I don't know where the line is. Trust routers to dynamically manage themselves (within reason) or write scripts that are vendor agnostic to dynamically manage them.

To me things such as auto-tunnel mesh/dynamic tunnels RSVP-TE seems like a wonderful little piece of software. Auto-bandwidth seems like a wonderful piece of software. For those to not work would require either a bug or for 100% CPU to kick off. 

I think that in the end, it probably would be better/easier to use a script to do the dynamic changes that one needs because it's easier to modularize. However if a router gives me a knob....I'll use the knob.

My friend is managing the development of a new 30-unit apartment building and has asked me to look into providing free Internet access in the rent.

I'm confident enough in my own networking experience to set up the building. I'm just not sure about the kind of Internet connection we'll need. Comcast business isn't going to work - they don't let you ""re-sell"" the connection like this. (Makes sense, they don't want us taking 30 potential accounts from them using their own service.) So it looks like we're going to need a dedicated connection. This is unfamiliar territory for me. I've been researching dedicated connections for the past few days, but I still need advice.

My first question is how much bandwidth will we need? I want to be able to call the connection ""up to 10 Mbps"". The apartments are being marketed to young people so we expect a lot of video traffic, especially in the evenings. Is there some rule of thumb for how much bandwidth a network should have for X many users? (I should mention the units are mostly 1-bedroom, so 1-2 people.) We don't want Netflix/YouTube to be unusable in the evenings, but we also don't want to pay too much.

Speaking of money, how much do you think this will cost? I put out a few quote requests. One that I got back was over $2000 for 50 Mbps. (I just picked 50 Mbps to get an idea.) I'm not sure if that's a fair price, but if it is that makes the whole idea impractical - at $66 per unit it'd be cheaper to just buy everyone a Comcast plan. On the other hand that quote came from a brokerage firm which felt a bit sketchy, so I'll wait for other quotes. I have quote requests with Cogent, the phone company, and Comcast's ""dedicated Internet"" service (which apparently doesn't have the same restrictions as business class.) I probably won't hear back from them until Monday at the earliest. Until then is there a good way of finding other providers in my area?

I've been imagining it as a very fast ticking of a morse code machine or whatever they used to do telegraph on where it was just a stream of ""bits"" one after the other and they had no choice but to be received one at a time on the other end. But packets that bundle those bits and bytes and the fact that there are multiple wires in a CAT5 cable is making me think I'm wrong in my visualization.

(With tips...),TheSawg,30,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/ilge9/passed_my_ccnp_today_with_tips/,"Aaaaaaaaaaawwwwww Yyyyyyeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaa. And thanks to r/networking for some of the tips and links.  But I won't leave this with just me celebrating.  (Home from hanging out with friends, working my way to r/drunk). Generic disclaimer of that people learn differently for others, and methods that work for one may not work for others.  But I did get the CCNP done in 15 Months passing each test on the first try (5 month downtime due to job promotion and crazy travel amounts).


So, these are my personal opinions and tips for anyone working on this cert.


- ROUTE then SWITCH and then TSHOOT.  TSHOOT builds on both ROUTE and SWITCH, so clearly need to do that one last.  ROUTE is the harder of the reaming two, so try to get that one done first.

- Try to get them done close together.  With TSHOOT, it is troubleshooting routing and switching, so it requires remembering a lot of the stuff from ROUTE and SWITCH.  The more you retain from the first two tests before you get to TSHOOT, the better.  (Though I'll admit, TSHOOT is pretty much my job, so it made it the seemingly easiest of the three).

- Do labs!  If you don't have access to a production network build a lab, real if possible, virtual works as well.  Look for GNS3 if you want a free router simulator.  If you need IOS versions for GNS3, Google is your friend: *intitle:index.of ios parent directory bin*

- If you have access to a production network, run show commands!  Labs are nice, but you always are limited to your lab resources. Seeing a full routing table, or complex OSPF topology in action will allow you to wrap your heard around them more.  Heck, TSHOOT is pretty much ""Know your _show_ commands.""

- Do not study the day of the test, or too late the night before the test.  This one is a bit more personal, but it seems to have helped a lot of my co-workers when they test.  Cramming usually doesn't work, with me cramming right before the test raises stress levels, but not help retention.  So cramming right before the exam may do more harm then good.

- During the test: be calm, sit back, relax, think, answer, move on.  The clock isn't your biggest enemy, you are your biggest enemy.  There is more then enough time to answer all the questions on all three tests.  If you over think something, it will bite you in the ass.  If you keep second guessing yourself, it will bite you in your ass.  Don't chew up your clock on a question you don't know and end up running out of time to answer the questions you do know.  Read (at least twice), think, answer, hit next.

- If you have the money: [CBT Nuggets](http://www.cbtnuggets.com/series/?id=1100)  I would pay for the videos before a simulator or testing engine. (I have had the pleasure of taking classes taught by Jeremy Cioara and he might be the best technical instructor I have ever had).

My current place of employ is looking to upgrade our ""core"" switching infrastructure (and I use the term lightly) because the existing units (3750-X's) have simply run out of expandability for 10 gig ports (2 per switch, even with a 4 switch stack it's only 8 x 10 gig ports).

Ideally, I'd like to stick in a Nexus - 7004, or even a pair of 3064's - to give myself a metric shitload of 1/10 gig ports I can use as I deem fit. However, this had been decreed as ""too expensive"" (and, admittedly, it is!), so I'm looking at alternatives.

I've ruled out other Cisco chassis based switches (6500 or 4500) because finding a high density 10 gig card which *isn't* oversubscribed to the backplane is impossible, so I'm looking to alternatives.

Juniper offers either the EX-4500 series of the QFX3500 series which would fit the bill, but again they're likely to come in at higher than desired prices (unless I can screw a really good price out of my reseller), so I've been directed elsewhere yet again - and come to the HP switches (specifically the 5900 series).

I've never looked at, let alone worked with, a HP switch - so I'm looking for input from those more learned than I to their abilities.

Basic requirements (apart from high 1/10 gig density in a 1RU switch, which they have covered) are L3 capabilities (OSPF &amp; static are all I really need), halfway decent QoS (or whatever HP calls it), obviously standard layer 2 features like VLAN's, LACP (port channel or LAG or whatever HP calls it).

Does anyone have some experience with these HP switches who is willing to provide some insight into the management/configuration compared to Cisco's (or Juniper's) interface? Are they similar? Radically different? A complete pain in the arse?

What about reliability/interoperability? I'll be hanging Cisco access switches off the HP's if I get them - does HP support the equivalent of Cisco's VPC (or Juniper's MC-LAG), or will I have to go back to spanning-tree if I want redundant links to different switches? Does HP support standard protocols for link aggregation, or are they like the early Cisco's and full of proprietary stuff?

I am not able to go on site to troubleshoot, as I on part of a remote helpdesk. For this assume I cannot rely on any onsite technical assistance.  Does anyone have any suggestions on a what course of action to take?  This is mostly to brainstorm possible avenues of resolving such an issue.

I seem to have got my answer. Correct me if I am wrong.

In a layer2 environment *all* multicast traffic is *always* forwarded to the ""mrouter"" (The mrouter can in this case be a PIM service or simply just an IGMP querier running on a switch). This means that if a switch has its mrouter on port Ge0/23 and gets multicast from Ge0/1-Ge0/22 it would always forward it to Ge0/23 because the ""mrouter"" is there, even though the mrouter didnt ask for the data. Snooping group tables does not get populated

Remember that we are not talking about multicast routing here. We're talking about how the multicast behaves across switches that are in the same broadcast domain.

Original post:

Spent the whole night yesterday setting the following up with me going home unhappy at 9am. Would appreciate if you guys can take a look at the diagram and perhaps see if there are any problems with it.

http://i.imgur.com/CUs8bpR.png

The main question I have is how the PIM service (which sends IGMP queries) behaves in this scenario, because if you look at the left switch (The cisco) its only connected with a 1G RJ45 trunk port to the main juniper which is running the PIM service and being the igmp querier.

Since the first switch has &gt; 2G multicast traffic being input to the switch, how would the output trunk behave? Would it send *all* multicast to the juniper PIM or only what clients supplied an IGMP JOIN on?

The client stationary computer in this diagram was able to receive multicast video which was VERY choppy.

Regards,


EDIT:

To answer all;
I am only multicasting locally, there is no routing going on for the multicasts. 

I know for a certain that traffic will never be close to 1G between the Cisco 2970 and the EX3300. Therefore currently I have only 1 cable between them. I have however left one port unused for LACP.

This diagram is using the PIM-SM (default?) and the EX3300 has an ip of 10.100.0.2 (This should be the RP IP?).


NOTE: The multicast sources at the bottom left of the diagram is sending hundreds of multicast addresses each and at no point do I expect the sum of listeners connected to the juniper to increase over 1G (Though I have left 1 extra cable unplugged for LACP if that would be the case).

Let me rephrase the question a little bit;
How would this need to be configured that in the scenario where there are 0 listeners to the multicast addresses would there be no load between the first cisco 2970 and the EX3300 (GE-0/0/0 and Ge0/1)?",,False,,t5_2qkaf,1366290339.0,,,True,t3_1cjbh9,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1cjbh9/multicast_network_diagram_do_you_see_any_issues/,

First of all, a sincere thanks to him for offering such a contest. This information has been confirmed by the mods, no lying here. At his request, he wishes to have his Reddit handle remain anonymous, and we shall respect this.

So, the contest! As you know, we in /r/networking try to maintain somewhat of a semblance in professionalism with this subreddit; **This contest is not that**. In order to win, you must **post a picture of yourself with your proudest piece of Juniper equipment** OR a **piece of Cisco/other enterprise level equipment that says ""I wish I ran Jun OS!""**--the more absurd the picture, the better! This contest will begin tomorrow at 9:00 A.M. EST, and will go until 9:00 A.M. EST next Wednesday, November 7th. 

Of the submitted pictures, the author shall select his favorite, and we will announce the winners.

The rule listing:

1) One picture per Reddit username. 

2) The contest opens tomorrow at 9:00 A.M. EST, and closes 7 days from that point. 

3) The image must contain your Reddit username, no scouring Google for a piece of Juniper equipment that's rack mounted to the side of the Grand Canyon. With that being said, image alteration is ~~also not~~ **NOW** okay. As per requested by Doug, quote, ""he's a sucker for Photoshop"", image modification ahoy! But it must include your reddit username. Bring on the monster trucks!

4) Keep your image submissions to the contest thread. Don't post them here, don't try to submit them as individual self-posts. 

5) The author will pick his favorites--upvotes and downvotes will be a user's gain from the image, but it may not necessarily be the deciding factor--it's 100% their decision, and we'll stand by it. 

6) Your image must be of a Juniper, Cisco, or other Enterprise level equipment. If it isn't Juniper, it must say somewhere in the image, ""I wish I ran JunOS!""

I was curious about some of the detailed concepts in the standards we use daily, and ended up downloading some relevant standards from the IEEE 802 working group (the LAN/MAN Standards Committee).

I compiled the Ethernet standards (802.3) and the LAN/MAN standards (802.1), which covers what I imagine to be almost all of the LAN standards you would want (barring 802.11 WLAN standards).

For everyday purposes these standards would be far more information than any single person in network support needs, but for those who were a bit more curious on how certain standards are met and defined, but couldn't find much detailed information online, this is a big help (it was for me).

Just note that in many cases standards are updates to former standards, with an example being 802.1w (RSTP) being an update to the former 802.1D standard describing switch operation, and thus it is included in the 802.1D-2004 standards roll-up (replacing STP which is no longer an active standard).  802.1Q was rolled up in 2011, and is by far the largest of the standards (over 1200 pages).  I have organized the standards in the best format possible (note that lower-case letters identified standards updates/modifications, while upper-case letters identify core standards to be updated and rolled up).

I am working on doing something similar with the IETF RFCs and the corresponding STDs (what an acronym they chose), but there's some reasons why this is difficult and will take me a lot of time to do properly.  The ITU recommendations may follow after, although much of their actively used recommendations is in SONET/SDH and Telephony.  I hope some of you can enjoy these and maybe it will help others get a detailed and in-depth sense where they want it.

NOTE: 802.1aq, Shortest Path Bridging (SPB), was released in March 2012, and should be available like these as per the GET program (6 months after release), but I didn't find it for free in my searching of the IEEE-SA website, so keep your eyes out.  Also note that all of these standards were downloaded under the 802 GET program, which offers these standards free of cost for anyone to download, so I imagine little problem in providing this organized archive to you.

- I am very knowlegeable about Windows and desktop hardware, but I know only the basics of networking
- My staff wants Apple everything; I prefer Microsoft.
- We don't have the budget for IT staff; it's just me and the contractor managing these things

I have bids from two contractors to build the basic network infrastructure. The installation costs and ongoing service agreements seem comparable, but the hardware they are proposing is very different pricewise:

- 1 SonicWALL Firewall, NSA 220 with Comprehensive Gateway Services

- 1 Dell 48 port GB managed switch, 10/100/1000 - $739
- 4 Wireless Access Point (802.11n) with POE injector - 2,396

*This contractor didn't give specific model information, so the prices here are taken from his proposal


*Contractor 2 - Apple clients:*

- 10 Meraki MR24 access points - $11,000 http://www.meraki.com/products/wireless/mr24

1 - Why is contractor 2's hardware so much more expensive? Is it better? Does it allow more flexibility for growth or easier management?

Our IT person is leaving at the end of next week for a job out of state.  I know my way around a single PC pretty well but I know absolutely zilch about networking. I start my new duties in a week.

We have two buildings with two different locations. Both have an ISA server, a Web filter, an Active Directory server, DNS, DHCP. Shared files &amp; printing in each building, not shared between buildings. Public wifi in each location, with access only to the Internet; a private wifi in our main building with full network access.  We're running the chief mission-critical program in the cloud from the vendor (SAAS). Email is also outsourced &amp; web-based, so that's not a consideration right now. I'm sure there are many more details I don't know yet.

My question is: How the heck do I take this on? Where do you recommend I go to learn how to do this? The outgoing admin recommended some books by Mark Minasi, and I'm looking into taking some free MOOCs.

1368973254.0,28,self.networking,1emq6n,Research: send streaming data from a ship to land.,shifty21,35,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1emq6n/research_send_streaming_data_from_a_ship_to_land/,"I have been given a task to come up with a reliable and fast network connection between a research ship out at sea and a land based analysis facility (right on the shore).  

Currently, the research ship travels about 75 miles off the coast and gathers data metrics revolving around water temperatures, salinity, sonar, radar and some other tidbits and copies that to an external hard drive and then put on a helicopter and flown back to the analysis station 75 miles away.  The problem here is that this is slow and expensive and not to mention that within the time the data is being transported back to land, new and more relevant data may come up.  

I have been looking at Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) that NASA's JPL has been experimenting with for inter-planetary communication.  This is similar to how the Mar's rovers have been sending data streams back to Earth.  Unfortunately, this takes about 40~50 minutes of delay since they are using microwave type communication.  Also, there are a lot of variables that can and will disrupt microwave transmissions such as solar flares, radiation and other cosmic phenomenons that can cause packet loss or corruption.  Another idea was to use lasers/optical/light based means of sending data packets, but there are other issues like the microwave communications that can cause data loss as well such as humidity, line of site, etc.  Light based is fast however and in laboratory experiments can get up to 500Mbits/s and latency is very low (speed of light and decoding light pulses) and can be compared to current fiber optic networks - minus the fiber.

I did look at Satellite internet which is commonly used for cruise ships and navel ships, but the cost is very high per MB sent and can have crazy latency issues due to atmospheric conditions like thunderstorms and thick dense clouds.

The idea I had was to develop floating pods that use a combination of Wifi (802.11ac @ 5Ghz), GPS, microcontrollers (Ardunio/Rasp Pi), solar power and basic propulsion.  The Wifi would be setup in a bridge/repeater mode with can-tenna type directional focus to shuttle data from the ship to other pods and back to land.  The microcontrollers would tie into the GPS and propulsion and adjust to keep it in a relatively static location.  Also, this could be used to dynamically adjust all the pods to move according to the ship if it is moving too.  The solar panels will power the entire thing, but also have an onboard battery.  Lastly, I would include a 512MB (or more) onboard cache to hold data packets just in case a pod goes MIA.

This is just a lunch time napkin idea I sketched out while out with my program manager.  He and our client like the idea, but someone at the table said that there has to be a commercially available product/service out there that currently exists that is NOT my idea - i.e. Satellite internet.

Anyone have any thoughts on this - kinda a shot in the dark as this is a very niche use case...

There are two T1's. Half of one T1 is used for our PBX Option 11 to provide phone service and the left over is used for Data. We are wanting to switch to an 8 meg connection via a fiber P2P. The issue is we need someone that can configure the two routers to maintain the connection to the PBX so we still have phones at the remote location. 

I asked a few local companies to quote us out the job and so far one has replied with a quote of $1600 for the work. $400 of that is to recover the password to the devices. I am not Cisco savy and am not afraid to admit it. That is why I ask you guys if that seems a bit steep for the work required? Or am I just being cheap?   

I know this will be asked: The reason the password is unknown is due to an admin that left the company and I have been thrown into fill everything that was his duties since we will not fill the position. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the feedback. And to answer a few questions: As far as the phones connecting between sites I should have mentioned there is an ADTRAN on each end that connects to the PBX to give it the ""T1"" connection it needs and is connected by a v35 serial cable. 
Once this is finished I will sleep better knowing the configs are backed up and the password is safe in my secret password keeping spot.

Assign each office a Class-C address and put them on a /23 subnet to open up the number of DHCP assigned IP's.

Organize them nicely so that if an external company ever wants to create a VPN with us, neither our IP range or theirs will run in to an issue.  I'm thinking something like:
10.100.0.0 = site1, 10.101.0.0 = site2, etc.

He's a Cisco guy, I'm a Juniper guy.  He swears that if you don't monkey around with a whole raft of OSPF timers, like SPF and LSA throttles, dialing down the timers, you'll have horrible non-deterministic convergence.

I've never tweaked an SPF timer in my life.  I'm accustomed to the Junos behavior, where an LSA comes in, and an SPF calculation is done after a 200ms delay.  Further, if needed (like more LSAs come in during the SPF calc), the router will do back-to-back SPF recalcs (default is 3).  After 3 back-to-back runs, a hold-timer applies until the next set of back-to-back runs (default is 5000ms).  I've done plenty of Cisco interop in very large networks, and never tweaked the timers on either side for IGP use.

Those defaults have never failed to provide fast, deterministic convergence, in my experience.

Further, he wants to do IP Event Dampening, which to me seems like yet another bad idea.  My understanding of it is that it's sort of like an interface hold timer (or carrier-delay in Cisco terms) that includes exponential back-off, increasing the up timer as the number of link flaps increases, up to a defined max timer value - correct?

If determinism is your goal, introducing a completely undefinable variable into the situation means you can *never* have determinism in your environment.  To me, a much more sensible solution would be to calculate the max IGP convergence time, and then implement an interface hold time with a short down interval, and an up interval longer than that max IGP convergence time..

Sure, there are some knobs that deserve tweaking like BFD timers and BGP hold timers, but to me, my colleagues philosophy just seems like ""Knobs Gone Wild"".  While I respect his abilities, I think he's just off the mark here.

What are your thoughts?

For each of the stores, the third octet changes, but the rest of the IP information is the same. 


Using this method that my colleague taught me, has definitely saved me a bunch of time, and is likely the most useful thing I've learned at this job. 
Within the Microsoft Office Suite, you can use the Mail Merge feature to pull values from a spreadsheet into a Word document. This quick guide is for Microsoft Office 2010, I know this is possible in 2003 and 2007.


Once in Microsoft Word, go to Mailings &gt; Select Recipients &gt; Use Existing List and select the spreadsheet you want to use. For example the spreadsheet might look something a little like this (I have no idea how to format this in reddit):


Hostname	Vlan1 IP	      Location

Switch1a	192.168.5.2	Seattle

Switch2a	192.168.9.2	San Francisco

Switch2b	192.168.10.2	New York



 Now, you can use Insert Merge Field and select the value you want to place into your document

http://imgur.com/dmnkY

With the Preview Results button, you can get the value to change according to (row number -1) of the row of information you wish to query. Obviously, you can get a lot more complex with this method, but this should be enough to get your started on building templated configs in Microsoft Office. 

 
If you need to split the merges into separate documents, even .txts, use this addin: http://www.gmayor.com/individual_merge_letters.htm


For some deployments, instead of fearfully changing switch IPs in a certain order, I generate a whole slew of .txt configs , load them on a tftp server and copy the config to startup-config at deployment time.


I hope this helps you guys with your mass deployments. I used to write combinations of perl/bash scripts to do this, but I've found this method much more elegant, less frustrating, and fool proof.

I've been studying networking and I've been thinking about this for a week. I have been unable to find a reason (lecturers and Google have failed me) and I was hoping someone might know.

Networking devices are divided into two categories: MDI and MDIX. Switches and hubs receive on pins 1 &amp; 2 and are MDIX, and most other devices transmit on pins 1 &amp; 2 and are MDI. Until the advent of auto-mdix to connect two ""like"" devices a cross-over cable or a straight and a physical cross-over switch on the device was used. Using the wrong cable would result in a dead connection.

If all devices used the same implementation (e.g. MDI) could a single type of cable (cross-over) be used for all connections? You wouldn't need to worry about cable types and MDI/MDIX. I've thought about it and I can't think of a reason against it, unless I'm being and idiot and completely missing something. I know it's too late to implement this now, but why wasn't it used when the technology was first developed? I can only think it's a legacy thing I'm not aware of.

The ability to safely segment traffic into several hundred/thousand groups is critical.  We have a large number of network providers that setup small networks inside the campus.  Today, segmentation is contained inside buildings using a general principal of not permitting VLANs to span the network core.

One of the emerging debates is the need for MPLS vs something else (OTV/VxLAN + BGP) to permit more flexibility for the internal network providers.  Some of the internal network providers are pushing for exclusive use VxLAN/OTV because want layer 2 across locations, don't see any stability concerns, and believe that the hardware platforms are cheaper.  It is worth noting that the internal network providers will purchase whatever hardware meets their immediate needs.  There is no vendor standardization. 

The core network provider is pushing for MPLS because they want to provide as much flexibility as possible, worry that the layer 2 spans introduce risk, and are less limited by funding.  The core provider would like to provide point to point capabilities, dedicated bandwidth, L3VPNs, etc.  The internal providers assert that all the MPLS features can be achieved through VxLAN and various BGP permutations.

Tomorrow at work I've got the task to setup a IPSec tunnel (l2l) from a customers' Cisco 5510 ASA to our project area network. The customer has been assigned a VRF in our project area network (Note that we have a VRF Lite structure with no routing between the VRFs) and with help from the IPSec tunnel the customer should be able to reach ""their"" VRF. 

I have setup IPSec VPNs l2l before, but never to a VRF; should think of anything special when configuring this? I do prefer to configure everything from CLI in learning purpose, but I have access to ASDM and SDM aswell. Does anyone have a guide regarding this that could help me through the steps needed?

Thanks! 

**EDIT**:

Seems like I can't get the tunnel to work so I'll be a bit more detailed. 

[Here is a simplified topology of the network.](http://imgur.com/rdM0uSO) 

In the project area network there are two VRFs, lan10 and lan20 and as you might guess they are in VLAN 10 and 20. The VRF lan10 have a host with IP 10.100.10.10 that should be accessible from the customer network (172.30.1.0/24) with the help of an IPSec tunnel. At the moment there are no IPSec configuration on either the router R2, the ASA have been configured through ASDM (Config at the end of post).

When configuring on the ASA, do I set it up as I would if there were no VRFs? Having the peer to R2's outside interface (192.168.200.2)? Or should I make a tunnel interface on R2 and peer to that interface? 

On the router, I assume that I need to make a tunnel interface and assign it to the customers VRF (lan10) just as perfectgyroscope said. But I can't figure out how the communication would go if I use a tunnel interface.

Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

Currently it's hosted on a couple of high-end OVH boxes but as you'd expect from a cheap provider, their network sucks and they're inflexible. So I'm now shopping about for a quarter-rack colo in the south of the UK, probably Surrey/London, and getting plenty of quotes. Sadly the bandwidth side of things is an issue; we currently peak at 160Mbps outgoing and have a 95th percentile of 125Mbps. If I mention that to any colo provider I've talked to so far about transit for the quarter rack, they've either gone ""We can't provide that"" or given me a laughably high number.

I'm still getting my head around networking but it seems like I should be able to arrange a 1Gig physical/~200Mbps soft-limited connection for less than £1500 a month. The site doesn't make much money (it's donation-supported and doesn't quite break even) so vastly expensive options are out of scope. Should I be looking at moving to my own routing platform and peering higher up the food chain than directly with a colocation provider?

I'd love to hear any stories from people who have done a similar move or have experience of pushing this much data around on a budget.

Voice (VOIP): I fully understand the concept, I just don't understand the PBX portion of the concept, too well.

MPLS: I've studied and understood the fact that its a replacement to Frame Relay, I understand that everything is based on TAGs/Labels and CEF Adjacencies, and that it runs at Layer 2.5.

What I understand it to be, is a BIG (Theoritical/Virtual/Non-tangible) SWITCH on the internet where two or more entities connect into that switch and share a common subnet by which they may communicate with each other.

The reason why I've come to ask this is because my office plans to implement MPLS between our HQ, and several sub-branches.

The interested parties wanted to talk about Cisco interop, so I decided to throw a CSR1000v in there.

So, it's not really a huge secret - I'm not in love with Cisco.  But, to their credit, they seem to have done a pretty decent job implementing an ASR1k in a VM.  Their licensing model doesn't seem the most user friendly, and the thing is limited to 50M of throughput (2.5M for me, without any license key), but in my case, who cares?  For a quick &amp; dirty lab, 2.5M is more than sufficient.

So, I spun up 6 VM routers, 5 vSRX and 1 CSR.  The core is 4 nodes, P/PE - 3 vSRX, 1 CSR.  The CEs are the remaining 2 vSRX.  The core is the classic ""box with X"" topology, and the CEs are dual homed.  It took me about an hour to spin up the VMs and get the configs knocked out.  Long story short - it all worked fine, despite my fingers continued effort to type ""commit"" on the CSR. :)

The process of bringing the VM online was straight forward.  You deploy a new OVF, and fill out a small form with questions for how you want it deployed.  Stuff like management interface ip, mask, default route, switch on ssh, make a user account, etc.  Still terribly disappointed to see Cisco's lack of ability to use a bit-based netmask, still forcing dotted decimal format.  At least the form for VM provisioning accepts CIDR notation.

Overall, it's a good tool for learning IOS-XE.  

Final point - it's a total resource hog.  If you take VMware's default of ""thick provisioning"" for the disk, you'll burn 12G of space.  I did thin provisioning on it, and it's currently consuming 4G of space (vSRX is taking 1.36G apiece).  Also, the RAM.. Good grief, the RAM.  Sitting idle, 1 CSR is consuming 2.8G of RAM, with 4GB provisioned.

I'm having some trouble with throughput measurement.,noodhoog,29,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1ex4ih/any_wireshark_gurus_here_im_having_some_trouble/,"I've been doing some throughput testing, and I'm getting some very odd results from Wireshark. I suspect either Wireshark is being weird, or I'm missing something fairly major.

To give a simple example of what I'm talking about, I have two PC's, both with gig NICs, connected with a crossover. I've got iperf running on them, and it tells me that it's happily pushing TCP traffic between them at a consistent rate of around 907477 Kbits, or ~886 Mbits

What I'm finding though is if during this process I take a capture of the iperf traffic and view the throughput from Wireshark, either from Statistics &gt; Summary, or by looking at the conversations under Statistics &gt; Conversations, the average throughput rate is dramatically lower than expected. In the case of my 886 Mb/s iperf traffic, Wireshark tells me that average bps for the TCP conversation was 91983982, or about 87.7 Mbps, roughly off by a factor of 10, which makes me think it could be a conversion issue, but if so I don't see where it's creeping in, and I don't -think- I'm getting my bits and bytes mixed up anywhere here, I've tried to be careful about that.

The same happens if I use speedtest.net or an HTTP file transfer, or any other throughput test, really. Wireshark always shows me the average as being way lower than expected, though not always by a factor of 10. It could be that my capture station is just too slow to catch everything, but I'm not seeing Wireshark complain about missing packets.

I'd appreciate any insight on this, even if it's just an explanation of why I'm being dumb and wrong, 'cuz I don't really understand what's going on here.

Edit: Ugh, I found the problem. Turns out the box I was originally using was dropping packets left, right and center, and for some reason Wireshark wasn't flagging it. I found a whole bunch of missing seq's which I wasn't initially seeing - in fact, I think they were getting filtered out of the packet list for some reason, which is weird, as I had no capture/display filter in place, but at least I see 'em now. Now I just need to find a box fast enough to snarf up these packets at line speed.

However, you made me realize I was asking the wrong question. I don't need to know what has the most switching capacity, I need to know what can get me the highest port density with non-blocking ports.

The Arista 7508E does 288 40gbe in 11U (or 26.18 per U), and the 7504E does 144 in 7U (or 20.57 per U).

The Cisco Nexus 7000 18 slot does 96 40gbe in 25U (or 3.84 per U), and the Nexus 6004 does 96 40gbe in 4U (or 24 per U), and the Nexus 3016Q does 16 40gbe in 1U (or 16 per U).

The Juniper PTX5000 does 32 40gbe in 42U (or 0.88 per U), and the QFX3600 is very similar to the Nexus 3016Q and also does 16 40gbe in 1U (or 16 per U).

The Huawei CE12812 does 384 40gbe in 42U (or 9.14 per U).

The Alcatel-Lucent 7950 XRS-40 does 400 40gbe in 84U (or 4.87 per U).

Over the course of my career I have done what is necessary to stay ahead of the game and am the type of person (probably like most of us) who receives multiple recruiter calls per week. Because of this, I feel that the employer should be cognizant as to what the market rate is for their employees and it is their responsibility to proactively keep them happy if they want to retain them.  I feel like if an employer has not given a pay increase it is because they do not respect the work you perform and thus the reason why I open my ears to other opportunities.  So my question is.....do you feel it is your responsibility to nag employer to be paid at the market rate....or is it bad taste to up and leave after 2 years of 1% pay increases for a large 30% increase with a new employer?

Recently got promoted to Network Engineer 1 back on the Telecom team (transition is 99% complete).

Currently, out customer's networks are separated by VRFs and only have access to their data and the internet.

My question is, what is the best practice when setting up network management? Do you keep it on it's own isolated network away from production traffic? Do you give this management network access to the other customer's networks? Do you use ACLs? 

And for SNMP, if I completely isolated my management network to where it only had internet connectivity, is it kosher to be sending SNMP packets over the internet? So for a customer, if they had 5 internal network devices I would open up 5 ""SNMP"" ports on the firewall (3000-3004) and point Solarwinds to this public IP:ports. Is this right?

I would like any ideas before I start configuring these devices and go so far ahead I realize I'm doing it the wrong way then have to reconfigure everything over.

All great tools compared to the many I've tried, and we also have a license for the NetFlow Traffic Analyzer which we currently do not utilize. I was actually using PRTG as a tool for quick and easy NetFlow analysis while supporting clients.

I decided to give Solarwind's NTA a chance and configured 3 of my core firewalls to export NetFlow data to it. In doing so, I also took it upon myself to also display the dashboards for NPM and NTA on two projectors we use for monitoring.

After both dashboards were up, I noticed NPM would refresh normally in 5 minute intervals, whereas NTA would not. After a manual refresh of the page, I would get [this.](http://i.imgur.com/CqWvPpW.jpg) No data. Not wanting to spend too much time figuring out why, I decided to reboot the server -- once up, everything was fine... for a couple minutes until it would stop working. 

I decide to call Solarwinds support and after a few minutes of a remote session the technician tells me it's because of a license mismatch between NPM and NTA.

I have a 250 interface license for NPM, and a 100 device license for NTA. The reason for that is because we are a medium-sized business that supports many devices, and a 250 interface license, while adequate for the time being, still gets used fast. At the same time, a 100 device license for NetFlow is much more than we need. There just aren't that many devices in our network that we would need NetFlow data from.

After digging through a log file for a minute or two, the technician tells me he's found the answer to why [NTA stops displaying data.](http://i.imgur.com/dvNxO2N.jpg)

    ERROR SolarWinds.Orion.NetFlow.LicenseManager - Orion components count:250, NTA components count: 100
    ERROR SolarWinds.Orion.Common.SWEventLogging - License limitation doesn't fit orion license!
    INFO  SolarWinds.Orion.Common.SWEventLogging - NetFlow Receiver Service flow processing is suspended due to licensing issues.

So I guess if you don't have a matching license count between these two products, for whatever the reason, they will cripple one of them?

Doesn't make much sense to me...

They even neglected to mention this to us when we recently upgraded the NPM license from 100 interfaces to 250, and no one at Solarwinds could tell me why the policy is or when it was enacted.

I will talk to my account manager but even if they were to rectify the problem I couldn't see myself supporting a company that does business like this. Many of you know their products and support don't come cheap.

Maybe I'm wrong, can anyone explain this?

I know I can just setup a bunch of wrt54g's with dd-wrt in repeating bridge mode, but the biggest issue I have is that my house is too far away from where the main router will be. Will bridging my router to another that is bridged to the main result in severe bandwidth loss at my house? It would look like this:

Main Router &gt; Bridged AP &gt; Bridged AP (my house)

I've considered getting two Nanostation Loco M2's just to get the signal to my house and back, but I'm not sure how that fits into the overall network of bridged wrt54g's. They look as though they are their own routers correct? And if that's the case I can't just bridge them with my wrt54g's correct? Or can I? 

I'll note here that wiring IS an option for this campus, but it would be something costly and extremely time consuimg as I would have to dig all the trenches. There is also concern of future construction as we have constant work teams coming to build.

I recently moved, and had been using Verizon FIOS, which also claimed 50Mbps, yet it more routinely delivered on that bandwidth even when accessing the west coast. I've called Comcast to complain and ask about ""other"" options, but they said it's out of their control.

Are there any ways for me to work around this, short of leaving Comcast (which I can't do ATM)?

I get what a DMZ is, I can't spell it but I get it. It's an area that is less secure but still under your control and behind a firewall that you use for servers that need to be accessed externally for whatever reason. It's separate to your internal network so that should it ever get breached from it's web serving ways, you're safe(r).

There's probably better ways to explain that but that's my understanding, here's what I don't get... where I work, we have servers that have 2 NICs, one on a DMZ the other internal - surely this is bad and removes any benefits of having the DMZ? If the server is breached then effectively the lan is... right?

Also... what kind of things do people do to breach servers? How can they do it? (I realize this is probably a broad question but any simplistic replies are welcome)

So if i'm right in thinking the above, how does one go about having a server on a dmz that needs to communicate with servers on the internal lan? At a guess i'd say this would all be through a firewall with rules setup accordingly...

Each customer is setup so that they get their own /24 (RFC1918), a VLAN, and a gateway on the SRX650. Also, each customer is in their own security zone on the SRX. The idea is that each customer gets their own private network (including us; our network is setup just like any other customer).

I have a web server VM inside our network that all other customers need to access from their own VMs inside their own networks. I setup the security policies on the SRX to allow all incoming traffic to this web server. When I try to access this web server from a customer VM via the public IP address, the SRX blocks the traffic. If I try to access it via the private IP address, the SRX allows the traffic through.

Some troubleshooting later, I found out the SRX drops packets sent to an interface with proxy ARP enabled:
http://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&amp;id=KB24709

This makes it impossible to access our web server via its public IP address. Juniper support confirmed there's no workaround, which means I have to access this web server by its private IP address.

It looks like there's two ways to do this: DNS Doctoring or NAT hairpinning. DNS doctoring has the advantage of being a one line config change on the SRX. However, the the idea of a DNS proxy transparently changing IP addresses sounds kludgy and could make troubleshooting DNS in the future difficult.

NAT hairpinning doesn't modify DNS and is a purely networking solution, but it would balloon the size of our config (the config is about 4500 lines at the moment and adding hairpinning would add about 1000 more).

http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1f2xxc/preparing_for_a_network_engineer_role_at_google

Some folks wanted an update so here goes:

I had the interview and found out shortly later that I didn't get the job. 

The interview was short (26 mins) and covered rudimentary topics. I found it difficult to build rapport with the interviewer because presumably they interview a lot of candidates. I got off to a rocky start when I was asked about subnetting, while this is generally easy it's hard to come up with the goods when under pressure. Then followed a few more questions and trivia, with surprisingly shallow levels of depth. All in all, I felt like I wasn't properly tested and that I didn't get a fair shot, I was answering the questions on their list, and they were dealing with binary- correct or incorrect. This is contrary to what you'd imagine, that they should be looking for your thought process when answering. While the interviewer had set questions I don't think they posed them properly, I started to answer some and had to look for qualifications to the scenarios only to find they had changed or big aspects had been left out. I put in serious hours preparing for the interview (must of which was not covered, at least it makes me a better network engineer). I was generally happy that I answered to the best of my ability, but evidently it wasn't exactly what they were looking for. 

TLDR Conclusion; The whole ordeal made me feel like a piece of meat answering trivia questions. These are the breaks, Google get to pick and choose who they want. A lot of it is down to luck on the day if you get topics you are comfortable with. I'll re-group the troops and re-apply in a year, next time all guns will be blazing.",,False,,t5_2qkaf,False,,,True,t3_1fb1ra,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1fb1ra/update_preparing_for_a_network_engineer_role_at/,

I have 2x100mbit cable connections at home. Each line has 1 IPv4 address, and I load balance outgoing packets on a Cisco 2821. This has been working very well for v4, but I was wondering how one would go about doing v6 balancing.
At the moment my v6 tunnel is terminated on just one of the lines. Normally with v4, the balancing isn't really anything special, because outgoing packets are NAT'ed so the source IP won't matter so much as the outgoing IP will be the one of the interface it goes out from, but with v6, you don't use NAT (DIE NAT, DIIIEE), load balancing them would lead to asymmetric routing.

DHCP

Setting Up the Network Environment To Use POAP

SUMMARY STEPS

1. Modify the basic configuration script provided by Cisco or create your own script.

2. Deploy a DHCP server and configure it with the interface, gateway, and TFTP server IP addresses and a bootfile with the path and name of the configuration script file. (This information is provided to the switch when it first boots.)

3. Deploy a TFTP or HTTP server to host the configuration script.

4. Deploy one or more servers to host the software images and configuration files.


DETAILED STEPS:


1. Modify the basic configuration script provided by Cisco or create your own script.

2. Deploy a DHCP server and configure it with the interface, gateway, and TFTP server IP addresses and a bootfile with the path and name of the configuration script file. (This information is provided to the switch when it first boots.)

3. Deploy a TFTP or HTTP server to host the configuration script.

4. Deploy one or more servers to host the software images and configuration files.

Anybody set this up yet and have a few more detailed descriptions for step 2 in particular?

The problem he is running into is his employees tend to be having too much play time while at work on Reddit, YouTube etc. While we all love Reddit and doing it at work is common practice he only wants to allow it for about 1 hour of the entire day. This covers their lunch break and also two smaller breaks. So I was trying to find him a solution to monitor what traffic is going where at what times. I can't blame the guy, he has quite frankly hounded them for a long time and is not just looking for proof to document it. 

Going through packets and trying to analyze it is unfortunately going to take too long. I was hoping to possibly find something based on a web GUI and wouldn't tremendously kill network performance. The only thing I have found even remotely close to having a good GUI for him is Colasoft Capsa 7.

Thank you to everyone who suggested different resolutions, but I believe I've got it figured out. 

OP here : http://redd.it/10vk3u

After some research, I found that the NIC we have system-wide (Intel® 82567 Gigabit Ethernet Controller) has updated drivers that resolve a number of problems.  Best I can tell, the NIC was being put to sleep (or power save? or something) and when it came out of sleep, it was restoring to 10Mb. 

I looked in to that issue and found that there WERE some updated drivers, and that the updated drivers probably fix that issue.  I applied those drivers to three PCs that had previously been experiencing the issue multiple times per day. After the update (and the weekend) we have not seen the issue again on those PCs. 

I mentioned in my original post that I had written a batch file to cycle the NIC in an attempt to re-create the problem. Obviously this didn't cause the issue to occur because the NIC was not going to ""sleep"".  For reference sake, in case anyone wants it, here is the batch file. 

set /A counter=0

:start

set /A counter+=1

netsh interface set interface ""Local Area Connection"" Disable

netsh interface set interface ""Local Area Connection"" Enable

timeout 5

wmic NIC where NetEnabled=true get Name, Speed &gt;&gt; ""C:\Network Cycle\NetworkCycle.log""

if ""%counter%""==""200"" (goto :eof) else (goto start)


Anyway, thanks to everyone for your advice, and thanks to those who immediately recommended ""check the PC"", even though I had been advised that the PC was not the problem.

I've been reading my networking books for the coming semester religiously and passionately. I really dig the concept and the complexity. My friend introduced it to me, and he's about to take his CCNA soon. He doesn't have an A+ cert because it's baby food for him since he already knows it from an early age. 

For me, however, I'm very new to computers. I've already been reading my A+ book for half a year now, and I find that also very interesting. But you see, I want to configure switches and routers, manage and maintain the traffic on the network, and so on, and not have to troubleshoot PCs at BestBuy or computer stores.

I know that since computers essentially connect through a network, that they do relate to the field, thus needing a person who can also fix that would help in the business, I would guess, but then again, I wasn't sure, and I thought that I may be wasting my time if I take the course for A+, or to know if the cert will complement the skill for career-hunting, so please, any advice is truly appreciated.

I thought r/networking would be a good place since it is mostly technical in nature.


I work for a major US University and one of the things that my department does is DMCA processing for complaints that come in from copyright holders.  They give us an IP, date, time, and file name and we then match that IP to our DHCP records to find out the MAC registered to that IP at that time.  We have a DHCP registration system to use our network that ties the MAC to a user.  We then notify the user and pass on the complaint and depending on the severity, we either give a slap on the wrist or we block the user.  It usually they have an open router, a virus, or they were actually doing the file sharing.   We do not monitor for file sharing. That’s the back story.


Here is the issue I am running in to.  We have been getting a lot of smart phone flagged for DMCA complaints and I am having some trouble coming up with how this is happening.  It’s a wide range of phones too, iphones, and android.  The only thing I can come up with is a possible virus, but the fact that it’s over so many different phones makes that hard to believe. 


There are some people here at work that are throwing around the idea that it is because of tethering.  But I have told them that when you tether it goes through the cell network and not our campus network.  So now they are saying it must be some type of app that turns there phone in to a hotspot to connect to the campus Wi-Fi.  This would then allow other people to connect to the phone and would get the person who owns the phone a complaint.  I told them that this does not make much sense, mostly because a cell phone could not support something like this, let alone all the different phones we see with this issue.   The file names on the complaints look like a standard torrent name, for example: The.New.Movie.2011.DVDSCR.XVID.Une-CM8.  


I have also considered that someone is MAC spoofing the smartphones, but I have no way to prove this.


I might be wrong, which is why I am reaching out. I have looked a lot and I have not found much.  If something doesn’t seem clear to what I posted, please ask and I will clarify.


EDIT:
One thing I thought about.  What if the copyright holders who monitor IPs are reporting the time incorrectly. Thus, when we check it to our records we see this IP assigned to a MAC that was registered to the offender, but now that time has passed the IP went back in to the pool and got reassigned to a smart phone.  If this is the case there is nothing I can do because we don't get involved with the copyright holder and is entirely up to the user.",,False,,t5_2qkaf,True,,,True,t3_ola71,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/ola71/dmca_complaints_and_smart_phones/,

My father-in-law and I are on a mission to get wifi from his house to his barn.  It's about 660 ft between the two points with a few branches and some green overgrowth.  We bought two ENH200 APs and we're coming up with some plans to getting them to talk to each other.   My current plan is to mount one on the flat side of the barn and the other using a small, unused satellite on the corner of his house.  

I don't believe that the dish is critical for our needs, but it creates a nice mounting point, and it would be extra nice to have the most reliable signal possible.  

Here are the questions (feel free to answer whichever):

- Seeing how satellite and wifi signal are different beasts, could using a satellite dish actually be detrimental or just no different than just mounting it flat against a wall?
- If the satellite dish could provide some benefit, what's the best way to mount to the AP to it? 

Currently the AP is mounted like this with the top part of it pointing at the dish http://i.imgur.com/I8rubES.png  My suspicions are the the top and bottom areas are actually at the weakest signal strength.

With that in mind, I propose that it should be mounted like this.  http://i.imgur.com/f3U7GfF.png  

The AP is capable of optimizing a Horizontal or Vertical polarized signal (enabling either/or in the WebGUI).

So I didn't get a chance to make one of these last week, I was summoned for Jury Duty and it threw my whole schedule out of whack. But we're back, and more inquisitive than ever!

But before we begin, I have two announcements:

1) Sometime recently we passed **~~20k~~ [21k](http://imgur.com/hrJ5hjs)** Subscribers! *Holy cow you (gender non-specific term)s*!

2) We'll be working on some upcoming changes to the rules. Since we've grown so huge, the number of same topics is now submitted frequently, so we're looking at ways of utilizing the Wiki to better enhance our sub-reddit so that ten million ""where do I go for networking jobs"" or ""what's a router"" or ""what do you do for monitoring""?

So! With that being said, we come to your question of the week! Two weeks ago, I asked [you how you unwind](http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1ihe03/mod_post_community_question_of_the_week/). 

So, **Question #15:** ~~Where do I go for networking jobs~~

 ~~What's a router~~

~~What do you choose for monitoring~~

**What's your roadmap?**

What are you planning to work on, either for yourself or your job, to deploy changes down the road? If you're a generalist like me, feel free to elaborate on whatever it is you feel like sharing. Remember, this is usually a long-term consideration with short-term deployment tasks!

I need to do some testing on a router for my employer with regard to the NAT capabilities, and potential VoIP issues.

Ideally I want things configured as per [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/ZcK28Zs) image, and be able to access the VoIP device in the 192.168.0.X subnet from 10.0.0.X.

How do I get started on setting up a network for a small school?,deiphiz,32,10,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1gefpu/im_really_new_to_all_this_how_do_i_get_started_on/,"**EDIT 2:** Ignore the entire other half of this post. All I really need is a place to get started. We already have an IT guy with a decent amount of experience. I guess what I really meant to say is that I want to help *him* out because the school could use a makeover on its network structure.

**EDIT:** Okay, I realize this is a bigger task that I thought it was. Please bear in mind that I know very little about networking, as all my experience with computers has been with software development. Right now, all I would like at the very least is someone to run me through the basics.

Okay, I'm not entirely sure if this is the right subreddit for this, so if anyone knows any place more suited for this question, please tell me.

First, some background. My father recently became president of a small private bible school here in the Philippines. I started studying here as a freshman, and I've noticed the campus could use a bit of an overhaul on computer technologies. I told the school board about it, and they basically gave me the freedom to try whatever I want as long as it fits the school budget. So why haven't I done it yet? I know next to nothing on network management.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still *very* computer literate, it's just more on the hardware side (building computers, client side programming, etc.). When it comes to networking, all I know is how to set up a router for my phone. The IT guy here at the school doesn't know much more than what he set up here either (The school doesn't have its own server, just a bunch of small, separate routers scattered around the campus).

The college has about 90 students, and a staff of about 50. There's also a grade school of about 300 students, but I don't think most students outside of the high school will be needing computers.

I really wanna help them out here and am willing to learn for whatever amount of days next to my studies in order to do so. Money isn't much of an issue either since I can work with the school's promotion team led by my mother.

So can anyone direct me on any places online where I can start learning and getting started on this? So I can plan it all out and make cost estimates?

Thanks in advance!

**TL;DR** I'm a student in a small school who's not very network literate, but wants to help the school's network infrastructure. I need some help on finding resources to learn about all this.

~~**Some detailed information on what I want here:**~~

~~Okay, now to what I have in mind. This is all based off of the network structure of my high school. I'll be talking about parts of it that I want to emulate in this school.~~

~~See, every school computer was connected to the central server. In order to use a computer, you'll have to log in to the server. It would then load default settings and make sure any applications weren't installed outside of what was there already. There was also a separate login for web browsers (usually from some kind of proxy) that was synced to the same username and password as the primary login.~~

~~Each student would have about a gigabyte of space on the server. There would also be shared central folder for everyone, and a private shared folder for staff. Those folders would get wiped on a regular basis though.~~

~~Restrictions on computers also changed based on what kind of account you log into. Staff accounts can change the settings on the school computers, and run files students can't like .exe and .zip. Certain websites were restricted by account as well.~~

~~We were also able to track most activity for every account (what websites they're visiting, what files they're accessing on the server), so if something goes wrong, we can find out who to blame ;)~~

~~Lastly, everyone had a an email account linked to a gmail network with our own domain name. For example: jsmith@foobarschool.org. Finding someone on the network simply requires you to type the first initial and last name in whatever form that requires a recipient email.~~

1367374506.0,21,self.networking,1dgert,seeking firewall implementation advice,sheinballs,23,2,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1dgert/seeking_firewall_implementation_advice/,"I have a large open network and am looking into adding a firewall in the mix. I was hoping to get some advice from some of you in the trenches. I'm really looking for high-level advice on best ways to implement this in terms of minimizing problems (mostly technical, we've already had lots of discussions on minimizing political). 

 Current environment:

- 1 core router (LOTS OF switch ports in-use here), 2 uplinks to the internet (one is backup). Default routing rules (no dynamic routing).
- 13 data closets connected via fiber to that core
- vlans utilized for breaking up broadcast domains
- servers connected directly to many of the core router switch ports
- basic ACLs to block common ports from the internet coming into the network 
- clients get a global IPv4 / v6 

Goals:

- have all vlans segregated and organized into different zones (re-classified into usage)
- servers in a tightly controlled DMZ
- implementation to roll out in stages to different pieces of the network, start with servers
- MINIMIZE downtime! This isn't a start from scratch scenario. I need to tack this on in stages with limited resources in a production environment :)

Conceptually I'm having issues grasping the best way to put a firewall in place logistically and follow ""best"" security practices. I'm concerned with having all these vlans mixing on the core router before they touch the firewall. 

Potential design #1:

- remove the core router's ip interfaces on the vlans, 
- trunk those vlans into the firewall. make the firewall the default gateway for clients on the vlans 
- have a /30 between the firewall / core router for communication between internet and nodes 

This makes sense from a layer 3 perspective but what are the potential problems here?  

EDIT - I tried drawing a crude diagram demonstrating that the firewall loops off the router

CLOSETS, 
SERVERS &lt;----   CORE ROUTER (firewall loops off this) &lt;-----------&gt; INTERNET


Potential design #2:

- 2 firewalls, one to separate the router from the internet. the other to separate client networks from the router. 
- Server network in between on the router ports.

This design makes more sense to me and we can do transparent bridging without having to change routing. The biggest downfall here is we are investing in two firewalls and if we wanted redundancy that comes to 4 firewalls (x2 at each bridging point).


EDIT - crude diagram below of two firewalls that are ""bumps"" on the line in between the end-users + router and in between router + internet.

CLOSETS &lt;----| firewall| ------&gt;   CORE ROUTER  &lt;---  | Firewall | -----&gt; INTERNET
                                                     |  
                                                SERVERS


What other design considerations I am missing here and what can some of you in the field give me in terms of advice in implementation here? One potential design I didn't add would involve us getting a Cisco firewall module inserted into the core router. The cost of one of those seems to be much higher than going the separate firewall route but I could revisit that if it makes the most sense and I can argue that.

&gt;* 5.1) What is the data contained in the Application Layer PDU that you selected? 
&gt;* 5.2) How many bytes of data does it occupy in the Data Link layer PDU? 
&gt;* 5.3) What percentage of the total Data Link layer PDU length does that represent? 
&gt;* 5.4) Ignoring the issue of size restrictions for now, what does that suggest about the efficiency of sending small Application layer packets vs. large Application layer packets over the network? 

1. Are they asking about the payload here and would that be all the data Hex data highlighted when I click on the application layer (which I believe is FTP)?
2. I believe the data link layer is the Ethernet II level. But I don't know where to find the size that the ""data in the application layer"" contains in the data-link layer. The wording of this question is throwing me off. 
3. I have no clue how to find the total data link layer length. When I expand it, the header length is 20 and in the length beside the info of the pdu i selected is 71. Are any of those the correct answer (im pretty sure they aren't)
4. Considering I can't answer any of the above questions I wouldn't even know where to start with this one.

We also use 4 different brands of switches, some of which don't support RSTP. :(

This means that once a single access switch goes down, the root knows about it, and every other switch throughout the network knows about it. Because of this, over 100 times per day, there is an STP reconvergence because of some minor power outages. This is causing problems for sensitive services such as VoIP, where calls get cut off, etc.

Oh, and there is basically no redundancy in the network, except the core which consists of tree switches.

Now, of course we are going to redisign this monster of a network. But that requires input from certain people, budgeting, etc. I want to solve the major issues today.

So I'm thinking, could I just enable BPDU guard on the root ports of each distribution switch, which are connected to the core, and end up with several separate STP domains?

How I get that access point online is another question.

**Idea 1:**

I could install a cable, buried in the ground, to stretch from the treehouse to the shantytown. Not sure if that's the best idea.

**Idea 2**

Maybe there is some way to create a wireless link? I could get two additional routers and set one up to connect to the other, and then fashon some sort of antenna to boost the signal strength (we have line-of-site). Would this be essentially a Mesh?

Any suggestions on the best way to do this? Cost is the big issue here, and upkeep. A wireless link would be best maybe, but it's also harder to support.",,False,,t5_2qkaf,False,,,True,t3_to668,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/to668/help_me_find_the_cheapest_way_to_get_wifi_to_the/,

&gt;The FreeBSD TCP/IP network stack now supports IPv4 prefixes with /31 as described in RFC 3021, “Using 31-Bit Prefixes on IPv4 Point-to-Point Links”.[r226572]

[Actual revision](http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base?view=revision&amp;revision=226572).

&gt;  Remove last remnants of classful addressing:

&gt;  - Remove ia_net, ia_netmask, ia_netbroadcast from struct in_ifaddr.
&gt;  - Remove net.inet.ip.subnetsarelocal, I bet no one need it in 2011.
&gt;  - fix bug when we were not forwarding to a host which matches classful
&gt;    net address. For example router having 192.168.x.y/16 network attached,
&gt;    would not forward traffic to 192.168.*.0, which are legal IPs in
&gt;    CIDR world.
&gt;  - For compatibility, leave autoguessing of mask based on class.

&gt;  Add support for IPv4 /31 prefixes, as described in RFC3021.

&gt;  To run a /31 network, participating hosts MUST drop support
&gt;  for directed broadcasts, and treat the first and last addresses
&gt;  on subnet as unicast. The broadcast address for the prefix
&gt;  should be the link local broadcast address, INADDR_BROADCAST.

Is there a workaround?,throwawayno54321,26,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/kienz/isp_has_forced_us_to_disable_dhcp_and_nat_on/,"Long story still kind of long: graduate students living in grad student housing. Until this week we have had a normal home setup excepting that instead of having a cable/DSL/whatever modem, we plug directly into a network jack in the wall. The University ISP decided that they didn't like that they couldn't see all of the devices behind grad students' routers to make sure they all have the school's NAC software installed, so they have now forced everyone to turn of DHCP and NAT on their routers (effectively making every router an expensive switch) and if the network detects an extra ""hop"" to get to your device it does not allow you to connect to the network. 

This has caused us all manner of problems, not the least of which is that we no longer have an actual wireless *network* at home (over which we could share files between our own computers in relative privacy and security), we are now part of the public housing network, so everything needs to be locked down. The people at our ISP have not even made computers on this network non-discoverable to each other. At this very moment I can see 16 of my neighbors' machines and several wireless printers on the network (only one of which is my own). We have severe concerns about the security of this set up (and rightfully so, I think).

So to get to my point: **Is there any way to work around this?** Can I possibly set up my router so that it looks like a computer to the network while still forwarding on the internet connection? Or some other similar alternative?

Alternatively are there any white hats who want to write some sort of worm to infect everyone in our complex? Or at least a script to print to all of their printers? (I'm only half-joking on these)

I was over at /r/sysadmin and they recommended that I ask over here.

So heres the issue I have a Cisco 3560G Assigned with an 192.168.1.X range, I want to connect an ESW-540-48 to it with an assigned Ip of 192.168.2.x range. The reasoning behind this to expand my Ip pool to allow the .2.x address to be use for several virtual machines that will be used for stress testing. While still being able to access shares/resources on the .1.x Address.

What would I have to do to allow the interaction between these two devices? Im pretty sure the 3560 is a Layer-3 Device, it does have routing options in the front end web interface but im not entirely sure.

Im pretty new to this sort of thing, I can truthfully say whoever setup our network before I was here has devices all over the place and the layout is atrocious so im trying to re-engineer everything.

- Should I import the full BGP table from ISP1 with default local preference, and also the full table from ISP2 with local preference 50?

- Or, should I import only the default route from ISP2 and a full table from ISP1?

About a week ago I wrote here asking for tips and advice about how to setup a VRF-aware IPSec VPN between a Cisco 2600 Router and Cisco 5510 ASA.

I've managed to setup the IPSec VPN, but I'm not able to ping from LAN to LAN. I've been starring blindly at my different routing tables now for some while but can't seem to find the issue.

[This is the topology I'm working on.](http://imgur.com/s16dF2P)

vPC1 is placed in the VRF assigned to the customer, called lan10. From that virtual PC I want to ping the laptop on the customers' network (172.30.1.10).

Executing the ""*sh crypto isakmp sa*"" on R2 displays:

    R2#sh crypto isakmp sa
    dst             src             state          conn-id slot status
    192.168.250.2   192.168.200.2   QM_IDLE              1    0 ACTIVE

The default gateway for vPC1 is 10.100.10.1 (R1). So the packet should go from vPC1 -&gt; R1 -&gt; R2 -&gt; R3 -&gt; ASA -&gt; Laptop.

Viewing the routing table on vrf lan10 on **R1** shows:

    Routing Table: lan10

         172.30.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    S       172.30.1.0 [1/0] via 10.100.10.250, FastEthernet0/0.10
         10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    C       10.100.10.0 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0.10

A route to the 172.30.1.0-network is there, via 10.100.10.250 (R2). So lets take a look on **R2**'s routing tables.

The VRF lan10 (Where the host is placed) have following routing table on R2:

    Routing Table: lan10
    
         172.30.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    S       172.30.1.0 [1/0] via 192.168.200.1, FastEthernet0/1
         10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    C       10.100.10.0 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0.10

and the routing table for the **fvrf** (inet-vrf) looks like this:

    Routing Table: inet-vrf
    Gateway of last resort is 192.168.200.1 to network 0.0.0.0
    
    C    192.168.200.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
         10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    S       10.100.10.0 [1/0] via 10.100.10.250, FastEthernet0/0.10
    S*   0.0.0.0/0 [1/0] via 192.168.200.1, FastEthernet0/1



Routing table on **R3**:

    Gateway of last resort is not set
    
         172.30.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
    S       172.30.1.0 [1/0] via 192.168.250.2, FastEthernet0/1
    C    192.168.200.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/0
    C    192.168.250.0/24 is directly connected, FastEthernet0/1
         10.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 2 subnets
    S       10.100.10.0 [1/0] via 192.168.200.2, FastEthernet0/0

And lastly, routing table on **ASA**:

    Gateway of last resort is 192.168.250.1 to network 0.0.0.0
    
    C    172.30.1.0 255.255.255.0 is directly connected, inside
    C    192.168.250.0 255.255.255.0 is directly connected, outside
    S*   0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 [1/0] via 192.168.250.1, outside

Am I missing something? Feel free to ask for more output if needed. And sorry guys for the super long post :)

All help would be very appreciated, thanks!

As displayed, packets are encapsulated/decapsulated and encrypted/decrypted however the ASA doesnt encapsulate.. When I try to ping from the Laptop (connected to the ASA) I can verify that the packets do come in on the inside interface aswell as on the outside interface of the ASA - both their input and output packet counters increases.

**EDIT 2:**

I noticed that the tunnel will only go up if I do pings from the VPC (10.100.10.10), if I try to open it from the customers' laptop (172.30.1.10) the tunnel wont open. 

**EDIT 3 [SOLVED]:**

Thanks to your help guys we pinpointed the problem and I was now able to solve it. The ASA was blocking the pings, thus making the pings to timeout.  By implementing a ACL to allow pings on the inside interface of the ASA I'm now able to ping back and forth, I can open the tunnel from the customers' laptop and everything works just fine. This is the ACL I applied that solved the problem:

    access-list 101 extended permit icmp any any echo-reply
    access-list 101 extended permit icmp any any source-quench
    access-list 101 extended permit icmp any any unreachable
    access-list 101 extended permit icmp any any time-exceeded
    access-list 101 extended permit esp any any

    access-group 101 out interface inside

When looking at _sh crypto ipsec sa_ on the ASA:

      #pkts encaps: 25, #pkts encrypt: 25, #pkts digest: 25
      #pkts decaps: 24, #pkts decrypt: 24, #pkts verify: 24

I am currently studying for JNCIA and I can't seem to nail down the main purpose of the loopback interface.

In the documentation it states:

&gt; Loopback interfaces: Used to provide a constant and dependable hardware-independent interface. The loopback
interface uses the lo0 designation on all platforms running the Junos OS. Use the lo0 interface in conjunction with
routing protocols to facilitate routing in a redundant environment that is independent of the individual physical
links within that environment. You can configure a single logical unit for the lo0 interface for each routing instance.
Each logical unit associated with a given routing instance can, however, have multiple configured IP addresses.

I have read that over, but its just not sinking in as to what main role the lo0 has? As far as I can tell it simulates a device (with the assigned IP) so that you can ping / traceroute etc to the lo0 interface to check that the route is active and open?

Is that right? If not and someone can put it into dummy terminology I would be most grateful.",,False,,t5_2qkaf,False,,,True,t3_1dic47,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1dic47/understanding_the_loopback_interface_in_junos/,

• Technical majors including Computer Science or Engineering or Cisco Network Academy graduates strongly preferred.
• CCNA certification highly desirable.
• Willing to relocate to Cisco’s campus in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina for the duration of the program (approximately 6 months). 
• Upon completion of the program, you must be willing to stay in RTP or relocate within the continental United States. Final work location will be determined after joining, and is based on business need. Flexibility and ability to adapt are definitely required. Individuals unable to relocate or those with very specific location requirements would not be a fit for this opportunity.
• US based candidates must already have a work authorization that permits them to work for Cisco indefinitely -- i.e., U.S.citizens, U.S. nationals, permanent residents, temporary residents (that is, individuals who have gone through the legalization program) refugees and asylees.

The only thing I could think of is that it could clutter firewall/router state tables, impacting performance. Then again, IIRC some firewalls can handle reducing the timeout of a TCP session on a per-port basis.

Our main information systems are ASP.net on a SQL back end. Our users connect to them from locations 10-20 miles away from our district office on a radio point-to-point network in which schools are branched off hub sites with no redundancy. The bandwidth between the sites is limited too 50-100 mb connections with the largest being closest to the district office. We know we are hitting bandwidth limits but due to a local company filing a lawsuit with the school district over the contract with the company that does our point to point radio towers, even though we have purchased the radio towers we are not allowed to install them until this lawsuit is resolved. Between the radio towers being older and limited on bandwidth my users for the information systems are experiencing time outs due to latency and dropped packets. 

We have two managers on the ""hardware"" side that manage installation and configuration of the OS, spam filtering, email, internet filtering, technician management and networking. As much as I tell them they should have latency monitoring system that informs them of sites that are experiencing latency (by pinging out from the main site), they state its ""not a big issue"".

However, I have been eating shit from our director who has been telling me I'm not following up with the complaints from sites being kicked from the information system at certain sites at specific times of the day. 

For example, in a single hour last monday, a single school at the tip of the topology complained about being kicked out of the system multiple times from different users. I was brought into a phone call that was being made to my directors desk phone. They explained to me that they were getting a timeout message stating the server didn't respond. I immediately asked why they were calling from their cellphone, to which they replied ""We've had issues with our phones all morning"". No shit, its all VOIP that comes through those radio towers.

I've had it with my boss and I'm done explaining to him the finer aspects of trouble shooting so I need data. While the other managers agree that the issue is due to latency, my director isn't getting it.

**TL:DR Work with fools. Read below of what I need**

I need a program that I can draw out a star/mesh topology and enter IP addresses for each node on the network. I need it to flash red for a while if a node experiences a certain ping response threshold.

I also need it save each result into a table in SQL (or access) so I can query the results and show them interruption times and when phone calls come in, I can have historical data to show them that its not application related but network related.

I really see this as something that someone has to have developed.

Today I had a client of ours report bandwidth troubles on his T1 circuit.

The customer was still skeptical as his bandwidth would hit the line rate, then drop to ~1 Mbps, then go up and then down, in a continuous cycle.

The customer's monitoring program for his firewall showed traffic to our device going above the T1 line rate (1.7-1.8 Mbps).  I suggested that packets are building up and dropping on our device, which is causing his TCP sessions to cut back, then build up, then cut back constantly.

He said he had no shaping on his device, so it sees a 10 Mbps (now 100 Mbps on auto-negotiate) link but can't see the 1.5 Mbps T1 on our device.  I suggested he try shaping his traffic so that it doesn't constantly peak as I said that could cause his traffic to get throttled back by packet loss.

so im building a bunch of infrastructure in a datacenter right, basically just upgrading what is there. the clients connect from their office, over a WAN link to this infrastructure. great.

today i discover that the whole network is a single /24 subnet. this subnet stretches across the 100mbit link! now i might not know much about networking, but i do know that this is a bad thing (tm), generally due to unecessary traffic crossing the WAN link. as part of this change i am going to be swapping out the switches(with cisco kit that can do routing, the current gear can route also however) so it seems to me a prime chance to fix this situation.

the problem is, its a real pain in the butt to fix. i have to change either a) all the servers and routers and switch ip addresses at the data center, or i have to change all the printers, desktops, switches, and servers at the office site. of course, changing the servers is a no go because that will probably break the services running on them.

there are a couple of internet links, one at each site, and wan links to 3rd parties going from both sites, further complicating the scenario.

my first thought was to fix it before i install any new kit. change all the desktops, routers, firewalls, printers, and any other devices (there are alot, including a VOIP system, thankfully on its own subnet) sitting at head office into a new subnet, and configure routing over to the other site. the logistics of doing this change, being i am one person and this is a high profile client, is quite painful to think about. what if i miss something? what if one of their apps is completely non routable and noone knows about it except whoever built this network?

I am now starting to think I should simply leave it as is. configure all my new equipment in new subnets, and configure routing to those subnets. everything will(should) still work and i wont have to change anything. i will have reduced broadcast traffic across the WAN anyway, and any new servers get built in the new subnet. eventually the problem will almost be gone (im building about 10 new servers as part of this project anyway). 

thoughts? am i missing another potential hybrid type solution? anyone done this before?

Basically, what do you want a entry level tech to know coming out of college?  Are there any subjects you would recommend covering?  Any good project suggestions? Any specific pieces of equipment I should request and learn myself?  Any suggestions/criticisms are welcome.  
  
I have an entry level and advanced course.  This is what I intend to cover in each course:   

**Entry (in no particular order)**  
NetBIOS  
TCP/IP (Subnetting, IPv6, etc)  
OSI Seven Layer  
Ethernet Packet Sniffing (ARP)  
Basic Routing (Static NAT)  
Wireless Routing (Basically just configuring a home wifi router)  
Windows Command Line Tools (ipconfig, tracert, ping, nbtstat, netstat, etc)  
DNS  
DHCP  
Popular Application Protocols  
Windows File/Printer Sharing/Basic Permissions  
  
**Advanced (in no particular order)**  
Linux Server  
  -Permissions  
  -File System  
 -Command Line   
 -RAID  
 -Backup Scripting  
Dynamic DNS  
Web Server  
  -Install Drupal  
Linux Routing  
Proxy Server  
Set up Kerberos (haven't done this yet, need to learn)  
DNS Server  
SSH Tunnelling  
VPN Server (haven't done this yet, need to learn)  
Email server (haven't done this yet, need to learn)  
   
My advanced course is basically a hodge podge of Linux server stuff I've done along with a few things I want to learn.    
   
Equipment:  Hubs, Layer 2 Switches, Home Wifi Router, Cisco 2600 (I've learned just enough iOS to set it up as a router.  No experience with communal routing protocols like RIP)  
   
It's important to me to provide the education the students are paying for and so all suggestions and comments are welcome.  One reason I'm subscribed to this subreddit is to learn more about what networking professionals deal with in the day to day, but I'll readily admit a lot of the technical jargon is over my head.

I usually reply into the thread but thought this really needs to become a discussion of its own.

A network engineer or network architect is a really ambiguous term [even according to wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_engineering).  In my head this is how I break them up and feel free to discuss

*  A lot of people who utilize this subreddit, and really the mast majority of network engineers are really **network admins**.  If you don't script or program, you don't constantly tear up and down entire topologies, you are not architecting but more maintaining and planning around a live network.  The reason a lot of people hate on degrees is this category actually has a lot of mix (people with or without degrees).  A lot of people start in tech support with minor certifications (like A+ or Security+).  It can be high stress but high reward.  I would think the equivalent for Microsoft would be a MCSE.  This type of job is really varied and can be as low as maintaing a small branch office or as high as working as a CCIE for JPMC in NYC on the trading floor.  
*  Secondly **Network Developers** are people who program *Network Appliances* such as routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers etc, or develop test scripts to make sure the gear functions as intended.  A lot of what I do falls here which creates a lot of frustration for me.  I have more in common sometimes with software developers at gaming companies then I do with some people on this subreddit.  Thats why sometimes I am like 'oh this again' when I see someone studying for their CCNA instead of actually wanting to understand OSPF or how a RFC works they just want the $ from the cert.  I saw some good advice on that previous thread that if you don't love networks you shouldn't foce yourself into it, I think I can back that up.  I really love my job b/c I get to program solutions for automation testing and make sure the gear you deploy works when you put into a network.
* Finally **Network Engineers** to me really need to have an engineering degree...  You can't just say your an engineer without doing engineering, but really its just a title  I am really not trying to start a turf war.  Its also why architects really hate that network admins sometimes call them network architects.  People do a lot of work in university to get titles, just think if I started calling myself a Doctor, or the computer network doctor.  I am sure people do that too but the point is how frustrating it is to say you are something that you are not...  To be honest its just a title but I think the industry needs to focus more on the differences.  I see network engineers more as high level architects whether its creating a new queuing system for packets in hardware on a particular blade (hardware engineering) or designing a network (similar to a network admin but a lot of times infinitely more complex, like I want to see math equations on the board for QOS policies) or developing a new algorithm to compute SLAAC entries or OSPF re-reroutes faster.  I don't think you can become a network engineer right out of school (or anyones first job).  I think its something you develop into... and while I think a degree is really important and I can argue the differences, there are people (albeit few) that I consider network engineers that don't have degrees.

Honestly I just want people to see the different ways you can go in the industry.  Network Engineers usually have degrees.  You can make a load of $ anyway but your day-to-day job is really different.  I never work on live networks, but I almost guarantee that code you use every day was touched by myself.  You don't have to have a CCIE, JCIE or whatever to make good $ in this field.  I also think degrees are really really important depending on what type of job you want to get into... and not important for others.  I just don't want people scaring people away from networking because you were a college drop out, were not that smart and then got a shitty job where you are on call all the time.  You!=them.  Plenty of people in this subreddit love their job.

**quick edit** I also think these are 3 really really broad categories, there are security focused, voice focused, hardware focused, encryption focused (yeah i separated encryption and security), and the list goes on and on but I think this list kind of is a good start for broad categories 

**Summary Edit**

I like a lot of the responses, this thread was not created to debate however, I think everyone has valid opinions.    I was just trying to give some of my **opinions**.  I mainly created this thread to show **the wide variety of network engineering jobs** and the **various educational backgrounds** people have that work on them.  I obviously have **my own biassed opinions, based on my own experiences** but I just want all networking jobs, from the guy who wires your house in, to the guy designing the new next gen routing protocol to be known to all.

So I got a call from an old co-worker yesterday. Long story short, he and a professional associate are breaking into hardware reselling via an ecommerce site. They're connected in the business world and already have ~5 pieces slated for delivery.

Neither of these guys are technical, so they want someone to 'OK' the equipment going to customers. They're talking refurbished small biz and enterprise class equipment from the major manfs (Cisco, Juniper, HP, IBM, etc).

I've been dealing a lot with Cisco licenses lately and get to researching their policies. Apparently, all 2nd-hand equipment must be re-certified before being elligible for almost any licensing, particularly support. My next research point was HP, but I couldn't find much information about their practices in this regard if there are any.

Furthermore, I'm a good hardware tech and I can run a piece through the rigors, but it's difficult to project life-span. Obvious defects and failures are obvious, but how many line errors is too many? I have to imagine that is these guys main focus for me. And, for an upstart, one replaced piece out of pocket could equal profit on 5+ pieces sold.

So can anyone shed some light on what their business model might be? Or how this kind of business works in your experience?

If they're planning on reselling 2nd-hand Cisco equip to big businesses, why do they even need me? Isn't it prudent, if not critical, to have Cisco recertify the pieces first?

So I landed my first network engineering gig. I'm very excited and think something like this could start my career. So far all my experience has been in my home network lab, GNS3, packet tracer and tutoring students at my college. I feel very confident in my ability to do things at a CCNA level with some little CCNP tricks :)

Anyway my question is.. Are there any senior/experienced network engineers out there that can give me some advice or answer a few questions for me? I would like to try and avoid any newbie mistakes on my first gig. I really want to do a good job.

shoot me a PM with your email if you'll answer a few questions for me :) I'm bound by a NDA so I can't disclose much 

thanks in advance guys!!

edit: THANKS GUYS! Great advice :):) 

I thought I would add a few things to my post.

edit:


BAh the guy that was giving me the gig has disappeared... haven't heard from him in a week :\


Thanks for all the advice guys! It looks like we sparked some good discussion :)

I've spent the night reviewing some ideas I've had and came up with a network topology. This is a just a lab not the real thing. Let's do a peer review!!

update:

So I talked to the guy giving the job... this is going to be easy.

All the PCs are going to use the public DNS server provided by google.. 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4
The public line is going to provided from a cable modem /w a dynamic IP.
DHCP is going to be supplied by the router.

He  has two more jobs for me :)

I'll let you guys know how it goes!!

I'm a self-taught guy who recently deployed a network in a small organization of about 700 PCs using some Cisco equipment they had purchased years earlier and never used.

We are now looking to do something similar pro-bono for a small school, and looking even at used equipment, the costs of Cisco is far beyond what they can absorb. Do you know of any resources to find the best pricing on Cisco, or, I've read that HP's Procurve switches are becoming more prevalent, and I dare say more preferred by many in the industry.

I see a lot of home network questions here and thought I would post my setup. It's not really elaborate or anything, but it works well for me. I would love to see everyone else's setup. I could use some new ideas :) 

**ISP**: Verizon Fios 25/25  
**Router**: Cisco ASA5505  (main firewall and SSL VPN termination)  
**switches**: Netgear GS108 and GS105  
**Wifi**: Cisco 1252AP  A/G/N  (This AP is awesome)  
**Server**: Core2Quad Q8400/12GB/5x 2 TB Samsung EcoGreenF4/ 4x Seagate 300GB 2.5"" 10k SAS in RAID10.   
 The server runs CentOs and VMWare Server. The host shares all the disk space via Samba and there are several VM's for things such as AV/streaming/torrents/DNS,DHCP/ETC...   
I used 4 of the 2TB in a Linux RAID 10 for 4 TB of storage for video and the last 2 TB is for local and network host backups. The 10K SAS drives house all the VMware virtual disks. 
For hosts there is 2 Xbox360's, 3 laptops, 2 smartphones, 3 home theater PC's. VM's are, 2 Server2008, Ubuntu, Win7. They all have specific purposes.  

Maybe this post is kind of pointless but I was hoping people might post their setup and maybe get a few ideas flying around. FYI, I've been a network engineer for 12 years now.

Recently, our 3845 INET router was unable to service AAA sessions because there wasn't enough memory available (via a debug). Upon inspection we were utilizing 90% of the available RAM. The CPU isn't effected as it has the expected &lt;20% utilization.

With a proc mem sorted I identified that our BGP Router process was utilizing 117MB to itself. Which after reading about BGP was odd since we are receiving a partial IPV4 BGP table which shouldn't require nearly that much resources. In addition, I used Solarwinds to identify the growing memory utilization trend (relatively new to the position) to see this was 12 months in the making as the utilization graph has a slow climb to the 95% utilization marker which begins throwing alerts.

Thinking memory leak we consulted Cisco via a TAC case and their recommendations were as follows:

Reload the router.
Reduce your number of routes.
Add additional RAM.
And yes, your BGP Router process is taking up way too much memory.

The router had been reloaded two weeks earlier and had resumed the high memory utilization we had been seeing. Also, 1500 routes is a partial table and doesn't address the issue at hand (that partial tables shouldn't take this much memory). This goes the same for the additional memory, not exactly addressing the issue. 

On a suggestion from a contractor and super genius we checked if perhaps there was an IPV6 table along side our v4. Lo and behold, there was. A good 15k lines. We hadn't known since the engineer who set this up no longer works here. I called our carrier (Level 3) to verify that we weren't utilizing the v6 routes and they confirmed. We had no 4 to 6 translation going on so it was a safe bet. Thinking this was a hot lead we scheduled a midnight maintenance to disable the IPV6 address family. We also prepped our arms for a round of serious high fives.

I disabled the IPV6 address-family an hour ago and it freed up a whopping 8MB. From 117MB to 109MB, not quite the result I'm looking for. On the plus side, AAA sessions are now serviced, so that's nice. Now I'm at a loss, mateys.

This sub has been super enlightening to a new CCNA who got a job blending Network Admin/Engineer/Architect which has me over my head, and dammit, it's awesome. 

If you have any suggestions or reading that I could do on this issue it would be very much appreciated.

EDIT: Thank you for your suggestions! I came in today to find out more about some of your suggestions and I found something interesting and perhaps our problem. I performed a show bgp ip summ, which is the following output. If I'm reading that correctly, we have about 450k routes taking up 52MB. In addition, soft-reconfig is enabled essentially doubling the memory footprint on a router that isn't specd for this. Sorry for the terrible formatting.

The setup is fairly straight forward.  The routers currently operate with the traditional crypto map configuration on their ISP connected interface.  We are migrating to a GRE over IPSec (DMVPN) topology and want to run it in parallel with the existing VPN.  (Once the migration is complete the existing crypto map based VPN will be decommissioned)  The crypto profile will be configured on the GRE tunnel interface with the ISP connected interface (which the crypto map is configured on) as the ingress/egress point.  These routers are the remote branch routers in this topology.  The DMVPN hubs are different than than the existing VPN hubs.

I *think* the only potential issue would be if the IP address allocation for the GRE tunnel interfaces are matched in the crypto map.  (This obviously won't be the case)  But it is certainly possible that I am missing something.

I've been beating my head against some VLAN related shenanigans for a while now, and I think I've finally assembled enough basic knowledge to at least ask a few well-formed questions. Perhaps you can help me out.

First, some background:

We have six physical sites interconnected via a gigabit fiber MAN. Originally we were six separate LANs, each site with its own subnet, loosely held together with a spoke-and-hub set of VPN connections/routing. Now every site connects over fiber to a central switch at our administration building. We have a single 100 Mbps internet connection at the administration building, with a single web filter and a caching server.

Our switching consists of 3Com 4500s, 4510s, and 5500s.

We are currently a single subnet/VLAN spanning all six sites, which as you know carries its own issues.

Our goal is to separate the sites into VLANs for the following purposes:

1. We need to apply different web filter rules to the different sites. This can be accomplished if we can assign IP ranges (within the same subnet) to different sites, and then add rules to the filter based on source IP range. This looks doable with DHCP relay agents (DHCP helper) configured on the switches, and multiple pools on the DHCP server.

2. Limit communication from each site to *only* that site, *plus* a centrally shared datacenter.

At the same time, we need to preserve the source IP of each machine all the way to the datacenter, that way the filter can log what actual end-machines made what web requests. Members of the tech department (stationed at the administration building) also need to be able to access machines at every site via remote desktop/vnc. This is part of why we are looking to use VLANs, rather than traditional layer 3 routing / subnets.

It's a sticky problem.

From what I've researched, it looks like setting up [Private VLANs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_VLAN) for each site, with the datacenter shared between the private VLANs, would accomplish my goals. What I'm having trouble finding info on how to configure private VLANs for my network hardware. So, specifically my questions are:

1. Do ""private VLANs"" require special hardware, or is it just a handy term for a specific way of configuring VLANs? If special hardware is required for private VLANs, where does it need to be placed? Edge? Transport? Core? Some blend of the three?

2. How would you actually set up the switches, as far as where to add tagged member ports, untagged members, ACLs, etc?

3. Does traffic from the private VLANs to the shared VLAN have the private VLAN tags stripped or modified once it enters the shared VLAN?

4. Does traffic from the shared VLAN gain tags for the destination private VLANs when it enters each private VLAN?

5. Would using a single DHCP server + relay agents work in such a scenario, so that each private VLAN receives IP addresses from a specific pool/range?

I might be totally off base with some of these questions, as I am a plebeian in the world of VLAN. I've researched for some time now, and conceptually it appears simple. However, (much like anything) the devil is in the details, and implementation is nothing but.

I'm open to hearing solutions alternative to using private VLAN. I'm more concerned with achieving the goals of a shared datacenter, isolated sites, and identifiable network traffic than the method used to reach those goals.",,False,,t5_2qkaf,False,,,True,t3_1eh74l,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1eh74l/setting_up_private_vlans/,

I saw this log and it was confusing me:
DHCPRELEASE on eth0 to 1XX.XX.XXX.XX port 67

The piece of equipment that wrote the log isn't getting an IP from the DHCP server (I think this is because the DNS server and the DHCP server share the same IP, I didn't set up this network but it seems to work for other people just fine)

My question is why would a dhcp server issue a release command if the unit didn't have a dhcp issued IP address? The unit had a static assigned address but when I changed it back to dhcp wouldn't that have scrubbed the old IP away? Or did the dhcp server see the old IP and tell the computer to get rid of it?

Sorry for the vagueness of the question. Just a noob in over his head here.

I have been deeply involved with computers all my life and have done things such as build and design websites to working over the summer at my school in the IT department as an intern. Around February I started looking into stocks, mostly Cisco, which while researching I heard about a company called Uiquiti Networks. Within the last years I have decided I wanted to become a Network Engineer. I mostly finalized this decision when I began working at my school this summer and got to talk to our Network Engineer and our Head of Technology. I also became vastly interested in radio communications, to which I have furthered my knowledge by inquiring information on and about the operation and configuration of such devices. Uiquiti has an amazing product line, which I have spent countless hours researching their devices and how to operate them. 
	So this leads me to why I’m here, I have read up a lot on the installation and operation of WISP’s. I find them to be quite inquisitive. At first I was pretty sure there was no way a young adult like myself could ever create or even for that matter maintain such a network. I then read about a company call Horizon Tel which received grant money to run 10 Gbit/s fiber lines though my state of Ohio. I was even more shocked to see that they had ran a line right through my county, which just so happens to run like 100 feet from my neighborhood. I then proceeded to email them and got a quick response, which basically said they would be more than happy to run said fiber to a location of my choosing. This location is across the street from the fiber line and is currently being developed, which means I could buy the land. I know the owners and I know if I paid a descent price they would allow me to buy it, as it is zoned for commercial use.  
	Also I might add that .78 miles down the road from said lot is a POP (point of presence), which I’m sure many of you know what that is. I might also note this was just installed this June and I believe it to be in operation at this time. This location would then allow me to connect without the worry of being restricted on what I use the line for, and yes I know that the price for the line increases greatly at these sites. Every pole from the POP to the lot is ran by our local power company and fiber could be attached if Horizon Tel is unwilling to allow us to resell their internet from their line. I might also note that Horizon is far from their comfort zone as they do not offer residential internet anywhere around here. I might note there is a five county distance from where they do offer said services. The only provider that offers speeds over 7 Mbit/s is Time Warner in our County. 
	I have done my research and understand towers are expensive and understand the cost, but I’m hoping that I can lease space off the local water tower (if that is possible), also I might note this property is adjacent to said water tower. I would be willing to provide free internet to County and City offices at no charge if said water towers could be utilized. I also am pretty sure that I would get the airMAX Titanium Sector antennas and set them at 60 degree increments. Which would put me at getting 6, and seeing how each is said to get around 100 clients, it would be a great starting setup. There are easily 2,000 homes within a 5 mile radius and the water tower and site sit on a hill which would provide great coverage and direct line of site of the potential customers. I would most likely use the Rocket M5 as my base station and my clients would consist of NanoBridge M2’s, AriGird M2’s, and NanoStations M2’s. Note: There is a great wiki on the Ubiquiti forms on how to setup and maintain a WISP. 
	Brand new power lines were installed this summer around the water tower to allow future growth so power will not be an issue. I believe I have a decent billing software in mind but any help would be greatly appreciated. As I am smart but not nearly as smart as those who already hold degrees, I would love any help you could send my way. Please be completely honestly and straight forward with me, as I have taken sometime to type this out I hope you see I’m sincere and would really appreciate any help you could offer.

I understand what it is for, and why, etc. but obviously there's gaps in my knowledge so perhaps someone could help me here.  I have a WAN router with a 44mbps link to our DC.  There is an outbound QoS policy based on four classes (Management, Voice, HTTP, and Best Effort)  I want the best effort to be dropped first.  I've set it up for WRED and given it a 14% bandwidth reservation while giving HTTP (which is most of our revenue generating, production traffic) 70%.  My impression is that those reservations will only be in use during periods of congestion, which means that the HTTP class will always have at least 30.9mbps available to it.  That appears to be how it's set up in the config, but I'm still getting drops when I'm nowhere near congestion.  Please help...

My company has Cisco 3750's, and we have recently been receiving reports of ""slow network"".  After my direct supervisor's initial investigation in to the issue, he found that the ports on the switch were reporting back as having auto-negotiated to 10MB. 

After investigating the issue, and finding out that it wasn't one specific floor, or department, the issue appears to be system-wide.  We have only noticed it happening on our PC's, which all happen to be the same type so we can't troubleshoot if it's a specific NIC that's causing the issue, or what.  I have checked from a PC while it was reporting at 10MB, and found that it does in fact show that it is connected at 10MB.  I don't know how to tell whether it's the switch or the PC that's causing the issue. 

Does anyone know a reasonable way to monitor for this, or troubleshoot the issue?  Again, my supervisor is probably working on it, but I have multiple roles in the company so I'm not always up to date on what he's doing.  How can I help him troubleshoot the issue? 

UPDATE because I left out details in the original post: I personally witnessed this a couple of times, only one of which I had time to investigate.  I was able to find the PC was direct connected, at 10/Full.  I disabled and re-enabled the NIC, and the PC connected at 1000/Full. A separate time, I was able to witness the ""10 - auto"" on the switch, overall same issue. 


UPDATE 2: 
At this point, I have evidence of the issue occurring, but can't get any support from my desktop support team on the issue. Everyone claims it's a network issue.  

My plan is as follows: set up a spare desktop PC at my desk, set up a batch file to cycle the NIC over and over, let it run for 8 hours. After this test completes, look through event viewer, locate any log files that indicate that it connected at 10m. 

If that test runs the way I expect, I should have at least a few 10m connections over a 2-3 hour period. It will be a little bit of extra time going through those logs, so if anyone has a good way to search through those logs, it would be appreciated. 

After that completes, I will run the test again, using my laptop (different NIC, obviously) as the test subject. Hopefully the issue will not occur on the laptop. We will see.

I know this is somewhat outside of the scope for this section, but I need to say this to people who are doing networking for a living or studying to go into it.

I am currently the Lead ""Engineer"" at my ISP/MSP shop, we're doing everything from T1 troubleshooting to Sonic Wall configurations to VoIP design, review and deployments. Every single day is troubleshooting, customer service and stress in a way I could have never experienced.

I currently make, aside from on call and over time, 45,000 a year.

I went in for a Tier 2 Network Engineer interview that made 60,000 a year. Nothing too special, or so I thought. In the area I live in, it's enough to finally enough to own a car and not go into debt whenever a car issue arises. Seemed like a natural step up from Lead NOC Guy.

I was absolutely floored and destroyed by detailed, protocol/routing specific, networking questions. This comes after a day of MPLS turn ups, router turn ups, troubleshooting, static routing, BGP configuration and weight+AS design and implementation with OSPF failover on the fly.

What startled me was how I truly have no idea what I am doing.

I did not know how OSPF worked on the packet level.
I could not answer how does BGP choose routes in a less than general way.
I could not name the composition of a standard IPv4 packet.
It goes on.

I could absolutely floor with QoS, troubleshooting methodology, passion, subnetting, design and/or review, but when it came to what I was using and the actual theory of it all, I died in the water. It was embaressing and extremely humbling as well.

I guess I wanted to ask... Where can I start to really ""learn"" everything. I feel as if I was thrown into the ice and have managed to stay on top of it by troubleshooting methodology and prowess, without ever really understanding the things I was working with.

I've configured and made these devices work, but want to know how can I understand the ""how they work"" portion.

I'm a senior in high school and looking forward to enter some sort of Information Technology/Networking program next year.

My Ideal situation would be to work on a BS IT, specializing in networking and security, and maybe take a CS minor. There is also a 5-year MS IT Administration and Security program I am looking at. Both of these lead you to a position where you would be knowledgeable enough to take the CCNA/Microsoft cert exams, and I could even choose Juniper as an elective to get that as well.

Money is obviously a concern, so looking at my community college options are pretty slim. They have a Computer Science AS, which is all programming all the time. I'm not sure if that would lead me somewhere I want to go. There's also a Networking Technology AAS that works through Cisco/Microsoft exams but is very non-academic and has a low capability for transferring to a 4-year degree

This delightful little toy seems to be designed only for home networks.  Basically, it's a stripped-down GoogleTV on a uniboard with an HDMI port and a built-in WiFi chip.  During the configuration, you use a WiFi-enabled computer and install a small applet.  The applet disconnects your WiFi and connects directly to the Chromecast to configure the Chromecast for your access point.  Then, your WiFi reverts and the two attempt to find each other on your regular wireless network.

Here's the fun part:  [It seems to do the second part of the configuration via UPNP](http://geeknizer.com/how-chromecast-works-chromecast-protocol-explained/), meaning I get get the thing on the network and even ping it, but it never completes the discovery.  Now, as far as I know, no Cisco enterprise wireless gear does UPNP and I'm not about to replace all of my access points.  Any suggestions?  Is there any way to disable isolation or support UPNP/SSDP on these devices? It's wholly unsuitable for an enterprise network, but I still have to find a way to make it work, and I'm loathe to put in a $20 Linksys AP just to support this thing.

EDIT:  Solved. On Cisco autonomous APs, IGMP snooping is enabled by default, but the command doesn't show up in the CLI.  According to Cisco:
&gt;If there is no multicast router for processing IGMP query and response from the host, it is mandatory that no ip igmp snooping be configured on the access point. When IGMP snooping is enabled, all multicast group traffic must send IGMP query and response. If an IGMP query or response is not detected, all multicast traffic for that group is dropped.

Snooping can be disabled either globally or on a per-VLAN basis using ""no ip igmp snooping vlan &lt;vlan-id&gt;"".

Thanks for your help last time (I should go and post my results which was probably a work around rather then a solution)

This time I'm a bit more mystified.
I have network (duh) that is basically a large switched network separated by VLAN's.

My problem is, all IP addressing is controlled by servers beyond my network, on a per-VLAN basis.
Each end user would be getting their own public IP. 
And yet, I have traffic appearing across the network with 192.168.20.0/24 IP address scheme and I can't really trace where it's from.

I thought this kind of traffic wasn't meant to happen because it's not broadcast. It's unicast traffic.
Particularly because its just a Switched network and not working on the IP level, I think the fault is somewhere in the MAC address tables?

I have a mikrotik at one point in the network where I through up a firewall rule 3 days ago to block all traffic on that VLAN going through that switch with IP address to or from 192.168.0.0/16 and the firewall has 28.6Gb of packets it's dropped, so it's not an insignificant issue (it's like 1~3Mbp/s on average)

I'm just confused why the switches are broadcasting/replicating this traffic like this
and no, not running any VPLS or MPLS (that's the next goal in the network!)",,False,,t5_2qkaf,False,,,True,t3_1fk0wt,http://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1fk0wt/mysterious_traffic/,

I work for an ISP and I think that we've got our customer network setup incorrectly.  However, I cannot prove it and our network engineers and techs don't agree with me.

I'll do my best to describe the situation, I'm only studying for my CCENT at this time.

I'm looking at trace routes to make this determination.  Due to not wanting to identify my place of employment I am not going to post a direct trace route.

When I trace route to anywhere the trace will look like this:

1.  My router 192.168.1.1
2.  The default gateway for the private IP range we use to manage our DOCSIS modems 10.x.0.1 it's a /16 network
3.  The public IP for our CMTS

This is a DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem network.

It is step 2 that I'm getting hung up on, it does not seem right to me that we would be seeing that default gateway as the customers are issued valid public IP addresses.  We do not use any kind of NAT or private networking for our customer network.

The situation that brought this to my attention is we had a customer who was utilizing 10.x.x/24 networks at 5 sites, all on the same CMTS.  If they used the 10.x.x/24 range they experienced terrible lag between sites, if they switched to a 192 or 172 based private ip setup then the lag issues were eliminated.

I'm worried that the presence of that private ip on step 2 of the traceroute is causing issues.

This is not my department of expertise at all. 

To preface, 

Our company was previously using Cbeyond through a T1/PRI (I think). 

We switched to Time Warner because it was cheaper and purchased DIDs from Flowroute. 

We are using a PBXtra server that is semi monitored/maintained by Fonality. 

Our issues began when we attempted to register our Pbxtra Server with Flowroute. (We flat out cannot register)

During a recent conference between multiple parties, a fonality tech did a trace to google and found. 

(see pastebin link)

http://pastebin.com/RLsTNhxy

According to the Fonality tech,  from looking at the trace,  after it hops onto past our public static IP, it hops to a private IP (10.36.32.1) which is on Time Warner's end.  The Fonality tech believes this is causing us to be unable to register our Pbx server with Flowroute and causing us to be unable to use our VOIP services the way we wish to. 

I spoke TWC support and they say that this is the way their network is structured and they cannot change it. 

We are at a loss here.  I don't know who is right and who is wrong and I am at my wits end with this. 

If anyone could shed some light on this I would be grateful.

This is a school setting so we are talking about a lot of pulls across a campus so the cost would be pretty high. Initially my thoughts were to pull new drops because we will not get any funding/opportunity to do this for 10+ years. However, the existing Cat5 is very well run and already negotiates at 1000BASE-T and pushes good speeds so I can't think of a solid technical reason to have new drops pulled.

Also, there are 6 MMF and 6 MMF pairs to each IDF currently. However, the MMF is OM1 and will not support 10Gb. For the fiber portion we'll have to have a cabling company come out to see what our existing infrastructure can support but I was curious to what you all think of the needs for 10 gigabit to the switch in the future.

I am in the process of learning HSRP and VRRP, and I have created a lab setup to see how everything works. I've encountered an interesting problem that I'm hoping someone can explain (specifically with HSRP at the moment).


I set up a few vlans including one for users (100), one for management (50), and some others for various groups. I have two cisco 3550's acting as the core layer in this case, with two 2950s as access layer. I have HSRP working on the 3550s -- I set one of them as preempt and a higher priority, and this one is currently ""Active"". The problem I'm noticing is that any client on the Users vlan can ping all interface vlans of the Active HSRP switch. For instance:


-A client on the Users vlan (192.168.100.0/24) is able to ping the Active HSRP switch's interface vlans (192.168.50.1 for management vlan 50 -- 192.168.200.1 for server vlan 200, and so on).


Is this common behavior? The client can't ping any other devices on the other subnets, which is what I'm wanting at this point. I just thought this to be weird since I made sure the 3550s aren't routing! I hope I explained that well.  Any insight is gladly appreciated!
