Sometimes, I think I'm super cute and that's okay. I've been browsing r/GW+ a lot lately (so many gorgeous ladies), and I think one of the things that I have a lot of trouble with is conceiving of the idea that anyone else could find me attractive. 

On top of being fat, which I feel like filters out a lot of guys and gals in the dating pool, I'm also trying to deal with dermatillomania, which has left me with a lot of scars all over my stomach and chest. Even as I'm trying to get more comfortable with my size, I'm still having issues with that. I'd really like to have someone to hang out with make out with, but I feel like the only people interested are strangers online. 

How do you all feel brave enough to ask people out? How do you know if someone is interested in fat women? I feel like I've worded this very clumsily, but I'm not sure how else to ask.

I have about 20 more to go before I hit my target weight, and am technically five pounds overweight, but I am fairly content with where I am now and am in no rush at this point to complete the last leg of my journey. I think this is because I am currently at the weight I was when I was a freshman in high school (I'm 20 now), so my body is familiar to me again.

Anyway, I still have some issues. Besides the copious amounts of loose skin and flattened breasts, I find myself furious when people who never gave me the time of day when I weighed 250 pounds now compliment me, respect me, and seem sincerely interested in what I have to say. What gives? Why should respect be tied to how much fat I have on my body? It makes me really angry. I know a lot of people might not understand, or just tell me to stop over-reacting, but there is no reason that I should be treated better simply because I fit into smaller clothes. Respect should not be correlated to what size jeans I wear. 

It's sad. 

What's worse is that I've always had disordered eating, and this doesn't make it any easier. Thankfully, I'm at the point where I can stop and tell myself that, ""No, accidentally_hipster, you don't need to weigh 100 pounds to matter more,"" but it's this type of thing that fuels other girls to treat themselves badly.

No secret camera tricks or lighting. This is the stomach of someone who has lost over 100lbs. A body belonging to someone who has been through every spectrum. A slightly chuncky kid, to an anorexic (diagnosed by doctor) 12 year old clocking at 98lbs to an obese 240lb 17 year old. As of right now with a weight of 138lbs this is what a real body looks like.

No pregnancy/kids just skin that has been stretched to capacity and somehow still managed to hang on.

http://i50.tinypic.com/28v4nxh.jpg

The body belonging to someone who was once in a relationship with a man who told her ""no normal guy will ever like your stretchmarks. normal guys would find them disgusting. No other guy could ever like your body"".

http://i48.tinypic.com/2laajyc.jpg

These comments coming from someone who dated me at my heaviest and told me he forbade to lose weight. Of course I lost the weight anyways. When it came to my physical and mental health I didn't need  nobody's permission for that.

I have a bit more stretchmarks that stretch just a little lower. A couple on my lower back and I have them all down my arms.

I work out 3 days a week at the gym on my days off but I haven't gone in a week. I was visiting my boyfriend in California. When i'm not at the gym on days i work i do some exercises at home. Crunches and whatnot. 

I work out as much as I need to stay healthy, though I'd like to get down to maybe 130 in the next few months so i may start a small diet again and add on some time at the gym.  Of course my stretchmarks aren't going to disappear. My arm flab isn't going to be worked off either. I've lost far to much weight to ""tone"" them.  No matter how normal looking good I appear in clothes...

http://i49.tinypic.com/xeiiir.jpg


Nothing is really going to change much when it comes to the loose skin and stretchmarks.

http://i46.tinypic.com/4qqx41.jpg


Surgery is an option i've considered...and someday in the future i may do just that. But right now....I think i'm just fine. I have someone now who loves my body just the way it is. Who thinks that i'm beautiful and I know he means it.
My arm flab..he rolls his eyes at. My stretchmarks...he thinks are no big deal because bodies tend to do that when they gain or lose weight. He's a rare person that actually understands that real people don't look like they belong on the cover of playboy/playgirl magazine. People have flaws and there's nothing wrong or gross about that. Especially when those ""flaws"" are a result of you bettering yourself.

http://i48.tinypic.com/2jbttzs.jpg

I may not look like Megan Fox, Kate Upton, or Giselle Bundchen when I take my clothes off and you know what...that's because I look like someone better. I look like me.

I don't care what you think the meaning of life is, it can't be that...  Beauty is a beautiful thing (duh), but it's not the most important thing.
The next time any person in public is mean enough to comment on your clothing choice or how your body looks (or how your clothing choice shows off the way that your body looks), you can just tell them that it's none of their business.  It is never anyone's business.
I don't go out in public to look like a supermodel.  Usually, I go out in public because I have to because I ran out of food or need to buy something.  And if someone says something like ""Wow, you really shouldn't be wearing those shorts,"" then it really isn't you who is at fault here.  Not only is this person rude enough to comment to a completely stranger on something that isn't their business, but they are trying to make you out to be at fault here.
That doesn't make sense.  Because if you are in public, a place that everyone is allowed to go, it doesn't matter what you look like, because anyone (regardless of how sexually attractive you are) is allowed to be there.  If someone has a problem with that, then they should be the ones locking themselves up and not going outside, not you.  It's their problem that they can't handle that some people don't fit their perfect ideal vision of beauty.  It's is not you who deserves to be shamed, it is them.  Anyone who thinks that they have a right to tell people how they should dress or what they should wear based on how their body looks in public has a very skewed idea of what the world is like.  Sorry not everyone is a supermodel, but it's not everyone else's fault.
I think this sort of just turned into a rant, but it's just some thoughts I had on some people's unbelievable rudeness.  Your body is none of their business.  It's a simple as that.",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_1i53dj,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1i53dj/for_anyone_afraid_to_wear_shortsbathing/,

I decided it was time for me to move on. I 'retired' and found myself again :) I ended up shaving my head, added far more artwork to my body, and pierced my septum.

http://imgur.com/r/BodyAcceptance/60jJeuV

This was posted eight days ago in r/bodyacceptance.

Okay, I've been 'underweight' my whole life, and occasionally teased about it (though never to the extent of an 'overweight' person, I know for a fact), and here's where this image is wrong:

It's not wrong for someone to love their bones (boniness? maybe that's what she means, because I'm pretty sure everyone has bones). If anyone thinks it is, it is because of this judgmental culture, not because 'overweight' girls exist and also like themselves.

It is not okay for people to call someone anorexic based on just looking at them, and the fact that people may do so from time to time does not mean that people who are harassed that way (like me!) have permission to join this whole culture in calling 'overweight' people ugly--though I hope for a future when 'fat' will be a neutral word.

It's not okay for anyone to tell someone else to gain weight. Even in ED treatment, a doctor telling a patient to 'gain weight' is, at best, a proxy for telling them to get healthier habits and attitudes.

And when 'overweight' people love themselves, that is not a threat to 'skinny' people's ability to do the same.

TL;DR: 'Skinny girls' should love themselves too, but they don't have to hate other people in the process, and they should recognize that they have an easier time in this culture than 'overweight' people.",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_1g04po,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1g04po/re_skinny_girls/,

People make funny faces at my legs when I wear shorts and skirts. Sometimes they wonder how in the world I got *so many* mosquito bites. Sometimes they try and make me feel better because they know someone who has eczema and ""it got better for them if they did this, that, and the other thing"". But mostly they think they're being subtle when they cringe at my legs. 

But my boyfriend, he is of a special kind. The first time we got naked ~~and had sexy times~~ we were in a very dark car and that was perfect for me. Next time we were under the covers. I basically tried to keep it going for as long as I could so he didn't have to see my legs. But when the day came that he saw my legs and my entire body in full, he did not ask about my mosquito bites, he did not make any funny faces, he did not cringe. My lovely boyfriend loves my spotty legs, my boyfriend helps me to not scratch, my boyfriend helps me when it hurts, my boyfriend puts baby oil on the places I can't reach in the shower.

I just came on to Reddit, to browse and look for funny stuff.  However my eyes were assaulted by post after post of this ""scumbag fat chick"" meme.  Thinking that surely not everyone on this site could be so horrible(an idiotic notion apparently), I checked the comments.  Across the board people spewed bilious hatred and cruelty, the 2 voices of dissent I encountered buried beneath it all.  

I am currently in tears at the thought that so many can actually express such bigotry, proudly, without remorse, and that their peers laud such deplorable behaviour.  I know that I should be used to such things, as I am not only fat, but black, but these memes, and the thoughts of the people who support them just fills me with such an overwhelming sense of despair.  

The fact of the matter is, especially in terms of the Olympics related posts, that NO Redditor watching the olympics is in said olympics.  These people, regardless of their size, criticize the athletes(as they would criticize anything they encountered, be it movies or restaurants, what have you), and NONE of them could ever even hope to compete, let alone place, but they seem to believe that larger people have less of a right to comment? What the hell is this?  What is wrong here?  Why is it okay to be so hateful?

My breasts are laughably small, but there's a pretty quirky and stubborn heart beneath them with a lot to give. 

My ass is also small, but if you don't like it, you can kiss it.

[TW for discussion of fat hate, weight loss]",GorseMonster,73,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/sg22w/after_10_years_of_stoic_tomboyism_and_a_hatred/,"[This is me](http://i.imgur.com/jwiqv.jpg) as of an hour ago today. It's not a lot of makeup; some BB Cream and a terracotta-y blush, but it means a lot.

I grew up fat, I've always been fat. I have a genetic web of reasons for it, and like many others, I tried everything in my power to get rid of it. From the age of 7-8, my weight gain was so much and so alarming, that I ended up being part of several studies in hospitals. At the age of 10 I was offered weight loss surgery, which my mother was outraged at (and rightfully so!). I was 10, I wouldn't even know the ramifications.

I was told by people from the Karolinska Institute (who headed up the MandoMeter program a few years back) that I couldn't be a 'real' woman, that I would never have children, or have a relationship. Basically, implied that being fat and male was infinitely more acceptable to being fat and female. They ensured that I always felt like I was letting everybody down or just being a disappointment, combined with high praise and rewards every time I shed a few ounces.

I'd always been a tomboy, a stoic lover of boyish behaviour. But the constant drumming of how I would 'never' be feminine drove me to a point where instead of pining to be able to look good in makeup, I found it beneath me. And for years, it was beneath me. I hated makeup and other women who wore it. I convinced myself that it was made for people who wanted to cover the things they were missing inside.

If I had to wear makeup for an interview, I would do it an hour beforehand and then feverishly wash it off afterwards, like it was burning me. I felt that it made me hideous.

It wasn't until I ended up with a romantic interest (who has now been my partner for just over a year) that I realised that makeup didn't have to be about the terrifying inch-thick application of powders and chemicals to make you look like somebody else. Particularly recently, I realise that I just want to look nice for my partner, not because of anything he says or does, but just because I *want* to look good for him. He's seen me without makeup, he's seen me with and he does not judge me, and loves me all the same. But it makes me happy to go that extra mile to look nice.

To sound like a slogan, when I look good, I feel good. And right now, I feel pretty good. Yeah, okay, finding clothes is a pain where I have to catalog-order them, and I could be healthier because the student lifestyle of instant ramen is *really* bad for me. And yes, I'm still exceptionally tomboyish and am a lover of fine lagers and ales, and I still spend 99% of my time wearing jeans and tshirts and stealing my partner's shirts....but at least I can wear makeup now, and feel like a woman when I want to.

Sorry for the ramble, I just felt I had to get it out there. It's been nice to talk about it. :3",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_sg22w,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/sg22w/after_10_years_of_stoic_tomboyism_and_a_hatred/,

Despite always being a physically active person I was always in agreement with everyone that i really should lose weight.

A couple years ago though, I started getting into strength training in a serious way, instead of the 40 lb dumbbell set I have at home I bought a gym membership.  My first day there I lifted weights that weighed more than most of the men in the gym.  My sheer mass had prepared my body to lift more weight getting out of bed in the morning than those 40 lb dumbells could ever have provided.

I kept adding more weight to the bar, week after week, my pants started to hang loose on my waist even though the scale never moved, and I learned what it really means to be able to carry your own weight.  What I can do is insignificant compared to what real lifters in my weight class have accomplished, but my potential is near limitless.

I still get shit about my weight, it's even harder to find clothes that fit because my legs have grown as my waist shrank, and I still have to check to be sure gear will actually support my weight.

I've recovered from some eating disorders: anorexia, orthorexia, and binge eating disorder.

I've never felt comfortable with myself- my weight and height have always been in the healthy range (the anorexia and binge eating seemed to cancel each other out), but my view of myself was skewed. I thought my face was hideous, that I was fat, etc. I can count on one hand the number of times I've been called beautiful. 4 times. 4 different people. Only recently has my mom called me beautiful.

I've come to accept my body shape, but still loathe my acne and body hair. Yet, I managed to go to the public pool and disrobe. I actually enjoyed myself.

I shaved every inch of my body that I could reach, but my acne couldn't be hidden. But I bared myself. I wore a bikini and actually felt comfortable. This is huge for me. I used to feel uncomfortable in t-shirts and jeans.

I've spent so long trying to get my view, my vision, and other's views to align. Now, I've accepted the fact that they may never match. Most importantly, I've begun to accept myself.

Earlier this year, I decided to embark on a journey to learn to love myself, or at least, accept. I started losing weight, picked up a sport I now adore to keep me active, and more recently, starting to read about body acceptance and realizing all those little things I always felt were wrong with me really weren't wrong in the first place.

I was asked by my younger sister (I was twelve when she was born, she's now in middle school) to volunteer for her school field trip so we could spend some time together and just hang out (since I now live about 30-40 minutes away) and one of her friends approached me and asked ""Are you so and so's big sister?"" I must have looked a bit confused but nodded. ""I just wanted to tell you you're really pretty!"" I was stunned (especially as I was in just jeans and a sweatshirt to handle the chilly weather we've been having). I've always found middle schoolers to be some of the most critical crowd out there and just to have someone compliment me out of the blue was the best feeling and for the first time, I found myself believing it. I just wanted to say thank you to all of you lovely ladies and gents who have posted things here to help me learn to love myself, and share how just a little confidence seems to go a long way!",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_11pqca,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/11pqca/i_got_called_pretty_yesterday_completely_out_of/,

I throw on sweaters and throw them off, thinking they emphasis the ""wrong"" part of me, or the color looks wrong. Any clothes that I had before I lost weight, I look in the mirror and see me two and a half years ago. This dress is too long. This dress is too short. The color is too dark. The color is too light. My skin looks wrong in it, my eyes look wrong it, my hair looks wrong it, *I am wrong in it*. 

I am late for appointments, I hurry breathlessly out to the car to speed to class. I get there, I stand in the bathroom mirror for ten more minutes, playing with my clothes. *I look wrong in this I need to go home and change I look wrong in this*. People compliment my clothes and I blush-- ""Why do you like it so much? Can't you see that it's not that great of an outfit?""

I see my reflection from a few feet away and I think, ""She's gorgeous, look at her hair! Look at her clothes! Look at DEM LEGS!"" I realize it's me and I feel sick. I realize it's me and I don't want it to be me. 

I don't want to admit I'm pretty. Because if I do...*then what?* Then I can't hide anymore, I can't blend into the woodwork and pretend I don't exist.

BDD is terrible. And it scares me to think that this is me *at my best*. This is my BDD at it's *least* intrusive. It's barely there compared to a year ago...but it's still so hard. No one I know can understand, they raise eyebrows and sigh, or question me, tell me they thought the ""monster"" went away.

The monster did go away. I can look in the mirror now and see myself, instead of a rotting piece of bulbous flesh with huge eyes and fangs. But that doesn't mean that the nagging biting teeth don't still chew at my brain sometimes. 

*""This sweater looks wrong. This dress is wrong. You are wrong. You are beautiful. You are wrong. You are beautiful. You are wrong. You are loved. You are wrong. You are gorgeous. You are wrong. You are sexy. You are wrong. You are confused and tired and beaten and won't someone tell you how lovely you are today--or else you are wrong. You are right.""*

To anyone with BDD out there--this is tough. And even when it goes away, it sometimes still rears its ugly head. Be comfortable in who you are.

She couldn’t have been more than fourteen years old. I had watched her as she walked through the little town store. It was late August and school would soon be back in. 

She had the last of the summer sun sparkling on her nose in the form of adorable freckles. She was slightly muscular, the kind of girl who probably swims, dances, runs-a real go getter! Her hair wild from the pool with streaks of gold highlights. Lovely, I thought!

She grabbed an ice cream cone and was heartily enjoying it as she stood in line with her shampoo, skin scrub and watermelon lip gloss. She turned to the right to notice the magazines set out for all to see who must walk through the line to get out.

I watched her look at them. Finally, her fingers stopped on just one and she picked it up. All the while I was thinking to myself how happy she had looked, how natural and hopeful. Just a girl in the world, full of hope and curiosity. 

I watched her start to thumb through the pictures. She would stop and look closer at some of the pictures. Sadly, I was standing too close to escape seeing what she saw. 

There were pages upon pages of women-well…I think they were. The pictures were close-up pictures of body parts. Very thin legs, with an article that talked about how popular it is now to have a “gap” between your thighs. 

The next article was about not having too saggy of breasts, then a page dedicated solely to comparing women’s butts. Look! This one is lumpy! This one is flat! At that moment I see the girl’s cheeks become a bit flushed. Her head dips down and I see her look at her tummy and legs. 

She turns a final page and it screams out “Got fat over summer? Don’t be mocked! Lose that fat now!” My heart sinks and at that exact moment I want to run over and grab it from her hands. 

I want to save her from such thoughts and from such despair. I’m afraid even with an army I may not be enough though. Not when every magazine, television show, website and more-continue to insist that our girls, women, boys and men become “Things” something that looks a certain way and fits a certain mould. 

The girl, the beautiful little girl, she steps out of line and walks to the rubbish bin, where she throws her ice cream cone away. As she turns to come back to line, she tugs at her shorts and puts an arm protectively across her chest.

Her head, which was only moments ago up and curious-hanged down, self-conscious. 

Ah, these little murders that happen to our girls and boys, our women and our men. It ought to be illegal. Really it should. Anytime soon, really. But…when?

I usually cope by just *avoiding* looking at mirrors or thinking about myself *at all*.

Over the last few months I've been getting a lot of **tattoos**-- beautiful and colorful flowers on my arms, legs, back-- and I've noticed that both *my* and *other people's* eyes are drawn immediately to the tattoos and *not* to my body.

The tattoos are, indeed, beautiful, and I get complimented on them. I love them as much as other people do.

It's had an interesting effect on me. I'm a lot less self-conscious about my body. I think it's because something I consider ""pretty"" is now a permanent part of me. It's like I'm presenting my tattoos instead of body.

When I look in the mirror at my body now I see pretty designs and flowers.

It's almost like makeup-- where I've painted on something to hide its faults and enhance its prettiness.

TL;DR: I feel like my tattoos have and are helping me overcome my self-consciousness and body issues. Maybe it's just a workaround-- but I sure feel better.

This is kind of silly, but it really has worked to make me feel more comfortable in a bikini in public. I'm in my 20's which is arguably the best I'll ever look. There will always be different body types at the beach or by the pool-hiding my body won't make that any less true-and the more I focus on being covered up, the more my focus goes to how I look. If for some reason I get fit and fab by 40, I will be proud to wear a bikini then as well. It'll be cool to say ""I look better now than in my 20's!"" And in the meantime, why should I punish myself? I'll wear a 2-piece now AND then! 

YMMV, but hope it helps you too ;)

Most recently this has come to include my body hair, especially that which makes its home in my pits. I'd decided to let it grow out, partially out of laziness, and it kind of made me smile when I'd notice them. There were still some feelings of awkwardness, especially if I felt the pits might come into anyone else's view. 

But then my husband informed me that he was envious of my pits (he'd previously confessed pit hair envy of Ryan Gosling as well). He doesn't find them attractive, I guess hairy pits are too ""masculine"" for him, but his envy made me stupidly proud of my hair. It's a weird feeling. They are desirable, though not in a sexual way to him, and that sort of made me feel like I was validated and not completely weird for growing it out.

To the Mods: I really don't know if the bits in the top half are largely appropriate for this subreddit. Please remove my post if it doesn't jive. 


As far as my body goes, since freshman year of high school (I'm 23 now). I've been slowly gaining weight. I have always had big boobs, and have always been built a little stocky. Clothes were such a bitch. I never found clothes that ever accommodated my body type in a flattering way. I always wore guys clothes for the most part in high school cause they were the only thing that looked good and felt good on me. Yeah, I got poked fun at, but in high school I had insane amounts of self confidence. I didn't give two shits what people thought of me. I was a badass outcast and I didn't care. 

College comes and I gain weight faster. Not a huge deal. I never thought I was a sexy beast, or beautiful, or whatever, but I didn't really care. I had my boyfriend and family who loved me and that's all that mattered. My mom starts doing personal training and getting healthy and fit, a recent cancer scare in our family caused her to wake up and want to live longer. But she's getting happier, feeling more secure with herself. Good for her. I'm finishing out my last year of college (146 credits worth), and shit just starts hitting the fan. 

I just keep seeing the pounds slowly get tacked on me (10 pounds a year), and I barely ate a thing. I would eat until I wasn't hungry anymore. This past year I realized I can't bike up a hill without feeling like I wanna die, and THEN I hit 200 lbs (5""5') and decided something had to change. I get a trainer with the same place my mom got a trainer at. He's alright but he's big on weight loss. I told him, ""Yeah, No. I want to get HEALTHY and I want to be able to do physical things, I don't want this focus to be on weight loss. I just want to be able to bike up the hill, and hike with my boyfriend"" The next few months I build up strength, but then he does really stupid bullshit that nearly kills me. Another trainer is shadowing us and he ups my standard workout an INSANE amount, not a gradual amount. I can't do hardly anything and nearly pass out several times in the session. Self Confidence blow #1. 

I kept telling myself ""I love my body, I love my body, I love my body"" but I didn't. I live in one of the ""Fittest"" cities in the states and am constantly bombarded with fat shaming stuff. I began to hate how I looked and when the stress from the last two months came things took a really nasty turn. I was stressed from school and work. Finals were looming and my employer knew I was on a break due to Finals, but instead throws a project at my face. I basically have to hand hold some outsourced people doing my job for way more money and far shitter than I would have done and taking 10 times as long. Self Confidence Blow #2. 

Whatever, I deal right? So the next week graduation comes, the day before I meet my dad, stepmom, and other family at dinner. My dad is an alcoholic and made some quip about how he wasn't too sure he was gonna come since I wasn't technically graduating due to summer school. Big woop. I let it slide. The next morning we're cleaning up for the guests arriving for my big day and I get a text ( A FUCKING TEXT ) saying Dad's not going to go to my graduation... Self confidence KO! (My mother, boyfriend and all my mom's family suspect that my dad had no real intention of coming to my graduation at all.)

Apparently I wasn't good enough for a phone call, my dad's business clients were more important than me. (There are other issues with my dad but I'll be brief). To give you an idea of how much of an asshole this guy is, he thinks its okay to fat shame his 12 year old daughter (me 11 years ago) and a 23 year old personal assistant in the same conversation. He also verbally abused me and shoved me into a wall when I was in high school. I still get horrid panic attacks when I'm cornered. Thankfully I never lived with the ass for more than 2 weeks. 

Anyways the graduation fiasco... that was the first week of May. Thankfully my mom's family and my boyfriends family still all showed up and supported me through what should have been one of the proudest days of my life thus far. But, Graduation's over and ice cream and chocolate galore from then on out. Eating till I want to pass out, and hello 10 more pounds in less than 3 weeks (I don't think anyone would agree that's healthy). 

I was stressed, heartbroken that my ass of an alcoholic father flew up to see me graduated and didn't even show, and I ate more than I ever did before. On top of that I am in the middle of the biggest work project of my life. Yeah Ice Cream and reddit to 4am sounds better and better. When I get stressed, I shut down. I don't sit there and try and alleviate the stress, I just fucking quit. 

I broke down nearly every other day, and my boyfriend stuck with me and helped me through. At one point I asked him if he even cared about my weight and he said no, that he loves me as is. As adorable and sweet as that is I was still having issues, I couldn't look in the mirror without hating what I saw. I didn't feel like that confident me I used to be who didn't care what society thought of her. 

I hated myself, and I wanted to just give up. 

So what in the fuck changed? 

**Clothes... honest to god the thing I hate the most. Clothes.** 

I KNOW RIGHT? I'm the angry kind of person that gets mad at society for fat shaming and having ill fitting clothes for big boobed gals like me. I grew up hating the very idea of fashion and clothes. 

I went down to see my mom since she was having a rough emotional time with work. We decide on Saturday to get drunk (I drink maybe once a month... if that) at lunch and go clothes shopping since that's the only time I'm willing to buy clothes. Up until this point I HATED buying clothes. All the clothes I would wear were bland t-shirts and jeans, or what I call ""Grandma Clothes"". I'd pick up solid t-shirts from target when I wanted to ""refresh"" my wardrobe. Fashion is NOT something you'd think of looking at me, but these grandma clothes I'd wear cause it'd be the only thing that would be long enough to cover my belly (just a thing I don't like, I don't like clothes that can't cover the belly &amp; butt! They literally feel weird on me, it's not an appearance issue it's more of a ""I don't like to be constantly messing with my shirt and pulling it down"" issue). 

We go into the store and I find this brand (Rock &amp; Republic for the ladies who are interested). I see some XL's &amp; 14's and think, those are some sexy clothes, I doubt they'll fit but WHATEVER. I was too intoxicated to care. I go into the dressing room and try them on and I'll be fucking damned they actually FIT, and even better... I LOOKED GOOD. My 38 DDD's looked a-freaking-mazing, and that 210lbs looked sexy as FUCK. 

As materialistic as this all sounds, I feel like trying on those clothes and even buying some this weekend really helped my self confidence. I came home that night feeling good about myself for once. I wasn't even wearing the new clothes I bought! I was just able to look in a mirror and actually LIKE what I saw. After about a month of 0 sexy times, that night... mmm damn yes ma'am... TWICE. IN ONE DAY. AND I WENT ON TOP!!! I was always wary about being on top with how heavy I was, but oh damn was that fun and I think he liked it too ;D 

I'm not 100% better, I'd be joking if I said I had amazing self-esteem and confidence back. BUT I was able to get back that feeling that I can flip the bird to society telling me I have to be a certain weight in order to look good, and I feel like I'm starting to get back to normal. Slowly but surely. 

Tomorrow I'm donating my grandma clothes to goodwill. I'm tired of hiding my body cause society says fat girls aren't beautiful. I dumped the trainer and his weight loss bull crap. It just wasn't for me. I'll still go to the gym mostly cause my workout is boxing and beating the crap out of things tends to be a nice de-stresser. And today I ate how I used to eat before the self confidence nose dive. I was able to eat normally again. 

Oh I did manage to keep up with my more in shape boyfriend hiking the other day! 210LB WIN! ) 

And the best part. Today I really smiled. I was able to look at myself in the mirror and accept my body and all it's blubbery goodness. &lt;3 

It feels so good.

**TL;DR: Normally am a self confident, cocky, badass. Self confidence took a massive shit. Bought clothes that actually looked sexy on my sexy fat body and I'll be damned Self-Confidence got a phoenix down (second chance)**

Ever since I read that, I've always dressed and undressed in front of my mirror in my room. It's made me unbelievably comfortable with my body.

The same goes for your body. Seeing my full body every day - with its real and perceived flaws - makes me love it. It's familiar. It's normal. It's natural.

I forget which one... and I really enjoyed it. Recently I have been quite interested in fativism and body acceptance. But now I'm confused...

Today I came on here and read a couple of posts. I won't point out which ones specifically, but there were two major themes I noticed popping up on here:

1) A lot of people seem to think that ""body acceptance"" includes ""coming to terms with being ugly"". This really irks me. I thought the idea here was to understand that societies ideals and expectations of appearance and beauty are incorrect social constructs that in no way need to be true. If that is the case, then should we really be saying to people ""Oh, it's okay to be ugly. Just accept that you're ugly and nothing will ever change that!"" or telling someone ""I was going to comment, but I looked at your picture and I don't think you're ugly at all! I don't see what your problem is!""

None of this seems productive or helpful in any way. When someone is having body image issues, it's often largely a part of the way our society constructs beauty, and it seems very counter-intuitive to say ""Oh, well, you're just ugly, so get over it."" Even worse, when someone is trying to share how they feel ugly and how this causes struggle in their lives, it seems equally counter-intuitive to then look at a picture of them and say ""Wow, you're SO not ugly AT ALL, clearly you're just crazy.""

2) A lot of people here seem to be of the belief that dieting is good, yo-yo dieting is bad, and that encouraging people to diet could never ever possibly be a bad thing. Seriously guys? Seriously? I guess it's fairly obvious which post THIS point is referring to, but come on now. A lot of the comments I've been reading here are shocking. If you guys don't see how things like extreme dieting and North America's war on obesity can have harmful effects on people, I think you need to start reviewing some of the posts on this very SR.

TL;DR: I have been shocked by some of the comments on this subreddit recently, and find myself very confused about what exactly it STANDS for.

I feel the need to post this, because you could just LOOK TO YOUR RIGHT to see it, but I'm afraid people won't, so I'm just going to copy and paste it. The rules of this subreddit state:

A place for body acceptance.
Welcome to r/BodyAcceptance! Click here for our philosophy, our rules on cross-posting and trigger warnings, and a note on voting.
We are often bombarded with the ""ideal,"" and the vast majority of both women and men, do not measure up, regardless of their weight. We all suffer from a lack of perfection and comparison to genetic rarities and we all deserve to feel good about ourselves and comfortable in our skin.
We welcome bodies of all shapes, sizes, abilities, and disabilities. We are about accepting yourself right now, as you are.
Some hard and fast rules:
Any abusive behavior towards any poster will not be tolerated. This includes a general rule of respect and civility.
No weight-shaming.
No advocating diets, no trash talking of bodies or negative comments about any bodies, and no telling anyone what they should eat or how they should exercise. These are personal decisions, and it is absolutely not acceptable to push them on others.
Posts violating these policies will be removed.
Any questions, comments, or suggestions regarding this subreddit may be directed to the moderators.
If you see anything that does not follow the rules listed above, please click the report button.

Several of these things have been broken by many of the comments I have been seeing here, and I'm just... frustrated, to say the least.

**Edit 1:** I can't see the original post that was made regarding this because it was deleted, but the topic of HAES has come up. I just want to clarify that the comments I am referring to had nothing to do with HAES. They're about comments that actually did promote dieting in a way that made me squirm. More importantly, I feel it should also be mentioned that adults have the right to choose what they eat and shouldn't be criticized for it: even if we think HAES is a wonderful thing, promoting it can still in a lot of ways lead to weight-shaming, and pushing HAES on somebody is still ""telling anyone how they should eat or how they should exercise"". Really, I'm in no way trying to knock HAES, but HOW is is brought up can STILL be very harmful and go against the this subreddits rules!",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,1362008101.0,,,True,t3_19bj9a,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/19bj9a/so_im_a_bit_confused/,

I decided to try Pac Sun, grabbed a couple sizes of the bootcut and got a fitting room. They looked horrendous on me and I sighed, took em off and quickly headed for the exit. 

The young man working asked me why they didn't work out and I decided to open up. I told him about my hips making jeans fit too loosely, and he suggested I try on the skinnies. I laughed and told him I didn't think those would look very proportionate, but he suggested I try them. I threw them on, expecting to hate myself, and was pleasantly surprised. It felt uncomfortable to like the way they looked, but they felt so right!

He knocked on the door to ask how it was going and I came out. I kind of expected him to just throw a compliment my way to make me buy them, but he didn't. He said that it was all about how I felt in them, and that they fit me very well. 

I bought two pairs. And I feel so amazing. Never once has a compliment left a long lasting effect on me or made me feel the way I do now. I am so thankful I came across this sales associate. He has no idea what an impact he made in one woman's life.

I've been uncomfortable for years wearing more revealing clothes when the weather gets hot because of how I think people will judge me, but I've finally become more accepting of myself and my body (thanks a lot to this subreddit!), so today I rocked shorts. 
My friend and I were standing in line for something, and all of the sudden, I hear the guy behind me say loudly to his friend, ""Some people shouldn't be wearing shorts. It's honestly disgusting.""
Even with all of my newly gained confidence, that hurt. That would probably still hurt if you were the most secure person on Earth. And normally, I'd just ignore it and continue on with my day, but my friend had heard it too, and she's very sensitive about her appearance, so she was already looking down. There was no way I was going to let some jerk ruin her day.
So I turned around. ""Excuse me, but we can hear you.""
He said he knew that, and that he wanted us to hear. I was a bit taken aback, but continued.
""Alright. I don't think that us wearing shorts is as awful as you make it out to be, and it's certainly not affecting you as much as your rude comments affect others. So don't be a dick, and if you insist on being one, at least do it out of earshot.""
He didn't talk for the rest of the time we were in line. I was a little upset for the rest of the day, but also proud of myself that I'd stood up for my friend and I. And I think I rock shorts.

  http://imgur.com/XYZeG
 
  Last August, I stopped shaving, got dreads, put up my middle finger, and have never had so much time in the morning ;). I'm not sure why exactly I decided to do this (stop shaving). I think I noticed I hadn't shaved in a while and just didn't do it again. But a clear influence was  a neighbor and beautiful kindred spirit I met around that time. She had hairy armpits but was the most classy, controlled, feminine woman I might ever meet. So when I look in the mirror and think ""I'm not feminine"" I think of her and smile.

  Hairy armpits and hairy legs do not diminish my breasts and ovaries.

  However, the road has been bumpy at times. All the sudden my relationship status has gone from spontaneous to particular. I get nervous undressing for the first time in front of someone I haven't ""prepared,"" hoping they won't just walk out. Thankfully, no one has yet. Honestly, I picked the perfect time to adjust as I've been in sweaters and jeans since September (I'm Northern). And with bikini season barging in I think about how self-conscious I get then more often. 

  And, I know you're secretly wondering... Yep, that means pubic hair, too. Being 19, I haven't completely escaped the social pressure, so I occasionally trim. I have had a guy tell me that he wouldn't go down unless I shaved. My feelings weren't hurt, but my reaction was 'meh' I'll move on. The most shocking thing to adjust to was realizing that I was no longer a girl with a vagina in the eyes of casual sex seeking men (or what have you). But rather, I became this foreign object behind glass. The amount of random men hitting on me has significantly dropped (60% due to the dreads I assume, like I said it's winter). One hand - it's great, obviously. Other hand - I find I pigeonhole myself into thinking that I am at the mercy of the other person's ""type.""

  Probably the best thing that came out of this besides feeling more like a HUMAN than a fucking doll with inadequate parts, is the effects it has on the people closest to me, especially my boyfriend. It's like I've handed them this powerful card that tells them ""your physical is not who you are to me"" People are liberated in this aspect because I am liberated. So yeah, if nothing else, try it before the summer.

My waist goes in, my hips go out, then my body cinches BACK in, and my thighs go out. Creating what I formally called a ""double bump"". 

For my entire life, I hated this. Larger thighs run in my family and didn't help the issue. I hated my big thighs, my weird lumpy hips, my permanent muffin top, my butt that was misshapen due to my high hips.

I thought losing weight might smooth it out. Nope. I thought gaining weight might add some fat and smooth it out. Nope! And then this just led to further frustration with my body and my esteem with my weight because I'm naturally built as a little bit bigger.

But then I found the term for it. I can't even describe the incredible feeling of finding it. It was kind of like a weight had been lifted. Other women have this, I'm not some kind of freak. It's just another body type that is beautiful in its own right. 

I'm not there yet. But I'm on the road to beginning to finally love my body. And I'm so excited that I've finally found the door to do that. It's still hard. I still think I look weird. And I know it's just in my mind - I see other women with violin hips and think nothing of it, they're still beautiful.

But I'm on my way. I can finally get there.

And for any of those wondering what violin hips may look like, here are mine. They might be a bit more severe than some women's:

My question is, is the purpose of this sub truly to help people achieve bodily acceptance, or simply help individuals convince themselves that they are physically attractive when that is simply not the case?

Now before you grab the pitchforks, please hear me out. A subreddit truly dedicated to bodily acceptance has tremendous potential to help many insecure and possibly depressed people find a much needed sense of community, a community where they can learn not only to accept themselves, but also learn to trust that others genuinely accept them as well. My concern is that this subreddit may actually be unintentionally furthering the very prejudice it aims to eliminate.

The front page is riddled with posts about how ""curvy"" is sexy. And to some, perhaps many, people that may be true. But take a look at the link I shared at the top, The very title came off in a strange tone-- ""Was it really just 30 years ago that women were allowed to have round hips on television?""-- The reason it strikes me as odd, is because I see women like the ones in the picture all the time on TV and magazine covers.

I felt a lot better after so many people here responded and I thought I would post how my doctor visit went today.
I had to have blood drawn, and I was weighed and my blood pressure was checked. I was nervous about all of this. Their scale said I weigh 20 lbs more than my home scale says. My blood pressure was 140 over 90, and the nurse said it was probably high because I was nervous (I do have a panic disorder) but my Doctor is concerned about the high blood pressure and is testing my blood for even more things than my Psychiatrist ordered, and I will share the results. The nurse used the regular cuff on the wall for my blood pressure, and she didn't have to go get a special huge one for me as I thought might happen.
I read online about my Doctor, and people warned not to get your blood drawn at her clinic. I decided to chance it anyway, because I wanted to meet her. The nurse tried to get blood but the Doctor had to do it. They said I have small wiggly veins and I am a bleeder. They tried about six places, and a few in my hand, even my finger! It hurt a lot. I have huge bruised bumps. But, I did it!
I think my Doctor is nice. 
I scheduled a Pap Smear with her on the 30th of this month. I don't know how I will get through it! When I was nine, a very mean doctor gave me an exam ""down there"" and shamed me immensely, said horrible things... So I am sooo scared. My Doctor says she is a woman just as I am, and she will do it right and it will be okay.

You see, I have always had some back and joint issues preventing me from being overly physical. Sure, I do a lot of walking, and my physical strength is fine, but when I try to ""work out"" - like run, outside or on a treadmill, or dance, or really anything that if you think about it, puts any kind of pressure on your knees or hips - I just end up exhausted and in pain, and quickly. I hear people talking about the euphoria they get from exercise - I always just thought, that's not something my body will let me experience. It's just something I'll have to miss out on.

You guys, this bicycle thing is really making me happy. I love it. I get on and awkwardly pedal around my apartment building for a few minutes, and I feel fine/am having fun while I'm riding and learning, but then I get off and realize I just did a lot of work! Sneaky exercise! I'm finally feeling that exercise euphoria, I have better body confidence, I'm sleeping better -- I know it's all in my head; I've been riding for like half an hour every day for less than a week, now.

My story.,ketone76,49,4,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/swg5y/permanent_body_flaws_dont_you_feel_doomed_my_story/,"I am a 22 year old man, and I've only had one girlfriend, who I think dumped me because of the sex, and my confidence has always been too crippled to get another girlfriend, let alone a date. 

While I had always been moderately overweight, and have gone to normal weight through exercise, I have body features that are not easily corrected. I have really dark stretchmarks and scars from where folds of body fat used to cause creases in the skin. 

But that's not really the worst. My penis is only 4 inches long when erect, and the girth of it is also similarly below average. 4 inches is something like 2 standard deviations from the norm. In terms of IQ, people who are under 2 standard deviations are considered mentally retarded. So I'm nearly pathologically small. There is no cure or healthy way to enlarge a penis.

Another blow was that 4 months ago I began to develop psoriasis and my body is covered in red rashes, mainly on my torso and stomach and thighs. Psoriasis, at least the kind I have, is basically like an allergic reaction to even the slightest friction, like wearing clothes. Again, there is no cure.

My facial looks are fairly average (I've been told 5-6/10) and I have all these body problems ""under the hood."" I can't ever see a woman finding me sexually or romantically appealing, and it rips me apart. I feel like I was destined to be a eunuch or a monk: basically a human that is forced to have a life devoid of romantic partnership. This mentality has really hamstrung my confidence and I've not had any luck with women.

I know this mindset is self-fulfilling and destructive, but I cannot shake it, because I do feel like some kernel of it might be true. That people are, ultimately, visually driven and I need to just accept that I was born without the right physical parameters.

There's an old prayer about having the courage to change the things I can, the serenity to accept the things I cannot, and the wisdom to know the difference. I'm looking for that wisdom, because I cannot tease out what I can and cannot change. I need to know what kind of expectations I ought to have.

I can't wear bikini's, low-cut tops, even regular tee shirts are worrisome to wear. Its summer season, so what is everyone showing off right now? The cleavage that I don't have. I hate my life. 

Its sad to say, but it really makes someone else's attraction towards my chest to keep me confident. Its pathetic. I'm pathetic. I know. I have zero self esteem and let people abuse me because of it.

Growing up, I just knew I wanted to go Greek. I did, and I have met some of the most wonderful women in the world because of it. 

I was never thin. My younger sister has always been this teeny thing, but no matter what I did, how much I did (or did not) eat, or what exercises I did, I could never lose weight. I was teased mercilessly for being big, even though I really wasn't that big once I went through my growth spurt. 

In high school I dressed to cover myself up. I wanted to be invisible. For the most part, I was. I just couldn't wait for college so I could reinvent myself. I was going to be this new, beautiful young woman, and being in a sorority was the key. I mean, how many ugly sorority girls are there in the world? I mean really, truly ugly? I was (and pretty much still am) convinced that being in a sorority and being ugly are two mutually exclusive events, but I also believed that being in a sorority was what made you pretty. 

*If I make it into a sorority, I'll finally be pretty.* This was my mantra, my main motivation during the madness that is rush. I got in, and eventually realized something.

**I was wrong.**

Nothing about my appearance changed. My sophomore year, I moved into the sorority house. My roommate was the definition of perfect, but the type of perfect you want to emulate, not hate, and that's why I love her as my close friend and really consider her a sister. If I had someone else as a roommate, who knows what my year would have been?

Anyways, my house has one huge shared bathroom. Mirrors everywhere. The first week in, we had someone come to spray tan almost the whole chapter. In the bathroom. With mirrors everywhere. Being naturally tan (thanks to a whole long summer spent babysitting some particularly outdoorsy kids), I opted out. I still saw everyone getting tanned though. I saw so many half-naked (or more) girls that day, all I could do was feel self-conscious. 

But then I listened. 

""I'm SO fat!""

""Ugh I hate my boobs.""

""Ew, I can't get guys 'cause I'm so tall.""

""I have no ass this SUCKS.""

""My ass is huge!""

""I'm too pale!""

""I'm too tan!""

Brushing my teeth that day, I realized that I actually kind of liked my body. And I felt guilty. I felt *guilty* for liking my body. Now, I know I'm really not ""competition"" for the size twos of the world (I'm a size 10), but I like to think I have some decent looks going. I like having curves, real curves, and looking graceful when I walk in heels, and having some killer calves (thank you 16 years of dancing) to show off in them. But if someone who is in good shape, healthy, and ""hot"" hates on their body, finding things wrong with it, then *how can I justify being proud of mine*?

The issue kept with me the entire year. I dressed well, I felt pretty, but the ""pretty girls"" would bash themselves in the bathroom, setting this sort of standard that I felt guilty for not meeting, and more guilty for being proud of it. It hurt me and confused me, so I did the most logical thing I could think of: I talked to my actually perfect roommate.

She felt the same way. She's skinny and built like Barbie, but she felt uncomfortable, too. We just talked it out. We both admitted we had things that, ideally, we would be able to change about our bodies, but we both decided we liked ourselves and our bodies. We decided not to body hate in our room. It was a sanctuary of Body Acceptance, a refuge from the negativity we felt elsewhere. 

What I learned that year was that being beautiful was a completely internal thing. You can be hot, but that means nothing if all you do is hate on yourself. You can be confident, but if everyone around you criticizes themselves, it's impossible to stay confident. You have to remove the hate from your life. I saw it every day, every morning as I got ready for class. I popped my music in and tuned it out. I took my own little attitude towards body hate. Any time I heard ""I hate..."", I allowed myself one quiet eye roll, one little shrug to shake it off. I dismissed it. What did it matter what *they* thought of *their* bodies? Nothing. All that mattered was how *I* felt about *mine*. And, as I discovered, I felt good.

Here's what I've come up with so far:

1. Body butter. I love slathering body butter all over. I make a point to rub it all over my fat-gathering, often bloated belly in an attempt to love it.

2. Hydration. Water is soooooo good for all bodies. Also, I recently learned that lemonade is good for preventing kidney stones. 

3. Movement. A sedentary lifestyle is not good. Moving around is great. It's *NOT* about losing weight. Personally, exercise helps me have less anxiety and physical strength, which makes me feel empowered as a person.

4. Deep breathing. Feels so good. Very relaxing. 

5. Progressive relaxation. Like the deep breathing, very relaxing.

6. Peppermint foot scrub. Tingles so good.

7. A great body wash for the shower. Feels luxurious.

8. Sleep - 8 hours. It's good to feel rested.

9. Sun - I get depressed without enough sunlight. This occurs both in the winter (less light) and summer (staying inside to be cool or during rainy patches). So sometimes I just have to go and sit outside in the sun and recharge. Just for about 15-30 minutes.

10. Sunscreen - despite the need for sun, there's still the need to protect the skin.

I'm hopeful this moment isn't fleeting, that maybe I have actually started down a path that is less judgemental.

I suffered abuse by a few people close to me and the little girl screamed inside my head that it was my fault. I grew up with an eating disorder from dance all the girls had one by the time they were preteens some earlier. The first time I threw my food up I was 9 my mother called me fat and said I would stand out on stage in my tutu if I wasn't careful you don't want to be the chubby girl. 

I had a baby 7 months ago and I am large my breast are a size F and I wear a size 10 dress/pants I look bigger because of my height. In all honesty I hate myself and I am trying to work on it but I refuse to starve myself again to puke to make myself unhealthy. I look at all these beautiful confidant curvy ladies and wish that was me that I had that confidence but I don't. You all are beautiful

DO NOT let your daughters end up like me if they are chubby tell them they are beautiful and men love curves. Don't let their fathers tell them they are to large to sit on their laps at 6 saying they are fat like their mothers. Fill them up with love and affection that is what I will do with my son even if I go one hating myself on the inside.

I'm skinny and small. Not unhealthy, I've never had an eating disorder, and I've never tried to lose weight. Just like many curvier girls get constantly harassed about their weight, I have gotten much of the same thing. What is strange to me, however, is that it's often not intended in a malicious way like it seems to be against bigger girls (like typical ""fat bashing""). I get comments from people who don't understand why anything they say would bother me at all.

Things I hear on a daily basis:

* I'm ""a bag or bones"" or ""skin and bones"". 
* I look like I'm starving.
* I'm clearly in danger of blowing away in a strong gust of wind.
* Seeing me naked would be like giving a bath to a kid, it wouldn't even matter.
* ""Do you even weigh enough to get your period?"" 
* ""Do you want my lunch? You look like you need it.""
* ""Wonder when you're gonna hit puberty.""

Etc, etc, etc. You get the picture. 
Yes, it's nice to be skinny because we live in a world where I am very privileged to be skinny. Society makes it easier for me to go about my life, and I'm never going to ignore that. But being skinny does not at all make me immune to comments about my body.

So here's the thing that really drives me crazy. I love the whole body acceptance community, including the people I know online and in person that I communicate with to work through our own body issues. The problem occurs when I feel like I get bashed by the very community that is supposed to be accepting of me. People often try to backlash against the fat-shaming by skinny-shaming, which doesn't make anything any better. Plus, because skinny is the ""norm"", nobody reacts to the skinny-shaming like they would to fat-shaming. It doesn't get taken seriously. (Not that fat-shaming often does, unfortunately, but you get my point).

Things that I constantly see from ""body acceptance"" groups on facebook and other places:

* ""Men like real women with curves"".
*Oh, sorry, I forgot I'm not a real woman, just one of those strange fakers with a vagina.*

* The ""since when did THIS become hotter than THIS"" pictures. I've sure you've seen them- a bunch of skinny girls in bikinis, then a bunch of curvy girls in bathing suits (notice the curvy girls don't get to wear bikinis, so they're still not helping their own point). It's well-intentioned enough, pointing out the beauty in curvy girls, but why do that when bashing others at the same time? 

* ""Guys like meat, bones are for dogs"".
*...Cool.*

I tried to do more research on other things to include, and ended up crying instead. I'm fairly okay with my own looks, but as I'm sure many of you have felt, it's hard to be okay with your body when it seems like others aren't. So my question is, how would you handle these kind of situations? I have tried to point out before that skinny shaming isn't any better, and we should promote all body types, but have gotten nowhere beyond pissing some people off. I also never know how to respond towards the strange and (I feel) extremely inappropriate comments made to my constantly about my weight, even when we're not at all on that subject. Nobody seems to understand why I would be bothered by any of this, because I'm currently more of ""society's ideal"" of very skinny. What should I do?

How could I ever measure up to them?  How could I ever be as sexy or beautiful?  I considered my stomach mutilated and shameful for a very long time.

But then I realized... there was nothing I could have done to prevent what happened, and all the stretched skin and scarring is a sign of my fertility and devotion as a mother.  I have learned to think of my stomach as mature, shapely and unique.  Sometimes I still wonder if I'll always be second best because of how my stomach looks, but such is life.

However, I feel that their small boobs fit better to the societal standard of ""nice tits"" than mine do. 

While we still hear a lot about big boobs being a good thing, this is not the main characteristic of boobs seen in mainstream media. Their main characteristic, generally, is that they are perky and have small areolas. I see a *ton* of really small boobs on television and in movies. I see a ton of big boobs too. And none of them look like mine.

I have big boobs that are not-so-perky (not unbearably saggy, but nothing like what is portrayed as ""ideal"", and my nipples definitely face more towards down than up) and they pretty large areolas. While I've learned to accept my body and love my breasts the way they are, I am still constantly aware of the fact that they look nothing like what would ever be shown on mainstream TV, or considered really ""nice tits.""

Here's where my problem happens. My friends with small boobs complain and complain, and they always tell me how amazingly lucky I am to have boobs. Yet I know for a fact that these girls have breasts that are way better looking as far as the mainstream media's opinions go. Any time I try and let a comment slip about having a problem with my boobs, I'm met with replies of essentially ""Oh my God, at least you *have* boobs, you're so lucky!!"" I understand that we're all going to have insecurities, but I'm tired of feeling like mine don't matter. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this; I think I just needed to let it out a bit. 

**TL;DR: I'm just tired of feeling like I can't say anything negative about my breasts because they're big, yet my small-chested friends can complain all they want, even though they look much more like ""nice"" boobs you would see on TV or in movies.**",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_x5eig,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/x5eig/an_observation_about_breasts/,

",ravencrowe,45,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/qlylz/i_noticed_a_disturbing_trend_on_one_of_our/,"Yesterday I was browsing r/amiugly because I felt like boosting some people's self esteem. If you're not familiar with the subreddit, people post pictures of themselves and ask if they're ugly or, sometimes, if they're fat. 95% of these posts are people who are insecure but are obviously pretty, know they're going to get positive feedback, and are just looking for a confidence boost. 5% of the posts are people who are genuinely curious/want to know how to improve their appearance.

Anyway, I was reading comments, and I noticed a common theme of ""You're very pretty, you just need to lose a few pounds"" or ""It's great you lost 50 pounds! Now you just need to tone up your abs, try hitting the gym a few times a week."" The more I thought about it, the more these comments bothered me. Yes, everyone was being supportive and nice, but they were all basically saying  ""You're almost pretty, but you'll be prettier if you're thinner."" They weren't encouraging people to lose weight to be healthy, they were encouraging it as a requirement for being attractive. These people are saying that you're not attractive enough if you have a beautiful face and dress nicely, you have to be thin enough to. And it's never enough. ""You're pretty, but you need to lose weight."" ""You lost 20 pounds? Good, now lose 5 more."" There is this strong belief these people are showing that the bottom line of attractiveness is losing all your belly fat, and this really bothers me. 

For the record, I am not large, I am pretty fit though I have a bit of pudge on my stomach (with some severe body image issues to go with it. I know I'm a hypocrite, I torture myself over being thin) but as someone who struggles with accepting my body this kind of mentality really upsets me.

Since I was 12 I've hated looking at photos of myself.  When I see a picture of myself, I have what can only be described as a mild panic attack.  I can't really breathe, I feel nauseous, and I'm depressed for the rest of the day or week.  A really bad photo will stick in my mind forever.

I can count on one hand the numbers of pictures I've taken since puberty that I can tolerate looking at, and even when I do, if I stare at them too long I start picking apart all my imperfections. I dread special occasions and any outing where someone can pull out a camera.  I've been told in counseling that I have body dysmorphia, but I'm pretty sure I'm not imagining the bump or the width of my nose, the fatness of my cheeks and the weakness of my chin.  Also now that I'm almost 25, I've stopped trying to convince myself that my 32B boobs will eventually grow.  They're not. 

I've been told in the last few years that I'm pretty, beautiful even, by men, but I rationalize that in a few ways:  1) men will say anything to sleep with a girl,  2) men will sleep with anyone when they're horny, and 3) even if they legitimately think I'm cute, that's only because I can't leave the house without foundation and tons of eye makeup to distract from the rest of my face.  As you can imagine, this issue results in serious problems in relationships.

I only have a few pictures up on facebook and they're all group photos taken from a distance.

I graduated from law school in May and refused to take professional pictures, so my dad forced me to take a headshot with his camera and then he blew it up and put it in his living room, where I have to look at it all the time.  It makes me physically sick to look at it. 

I know I'm smart, people seem to think I'm funny, and they genuinely seem to enjoy my company.  I don't have any self-esteem problems about anything other than my looks.  

One last thing--mirrors are hit or miss.  Sometimes I can look in a mirror and think I look OK.  But every single photo of myself is consistently bad, and consistently VERY DIFFERENT from how I think I look in the mirror.  

I don't think this will ever change, in fact I can only assume it will get worse as I age.  I've never met anyone else who was physically repulsed by photos of themselves like this.  If anyone else experiences this, I'd love to know.

The second time was today. I was on my period again, but on the last day and it went fantastic! I was feeling fine all day until I got on line to go on a water ride. I was the second person (same cousin. She was first) in this line and a worker came to my line out of no where. He said, ""I love this line cause there's always pretty girls here."" I'm guessing this was meant for my cousin to hear because he flirted with her when she was waiting for me after the ride, but she left when he came over. When I was the first in line, he told his co-worker, ""but not now.""

And then there's me. I have a big gut and no breasts. I am that girl that fall outside every standard. I am so pear-ey that I feel there are hardly any women who suffer from this. Almost every girl with my breasts is beautifully skinny. And the women with my gut are lovely shaped in the hips, butt and breasts. I feel like have gotten the worst of both worlds, also having a body that stores most of my fat in my stomach. I'm also ridicously hairy and have the worst eyesight even though glasses look horrible on me. Great genes I have.

I don't know.. I really just want a normal body, an average and acceptable body. I feel like there aren't any pro's about my body, only cons. I hear girls with big breasts complain about things being to small for their chest. And I would love that. I know the grass is greener, but all I get is things to large for my chest.

First, some context. I'm 5'6"", around 150-160lbs with a pear-shaped or hourglass figure. For years I've had problems finding jeans that fit all parts of my legs: thighs, waist, waist height, etc. Trying on pair after pair and having them fit only 2 out of 3 areas has always been really frustrating for me.

But! Today I have seen the light, and that is Old Navy's body shape organization system. Here is the Sweetheart jean, which is perfect for my fuller thighs and a smaller waist. http://oldnavy.gap.com/Asset_Archive/ONWeb/content/0005/169/922/assets/4_sweetheart.jpg

For the first time I tried on a pair of pants and they fit perfectly! This kind of clothing organization system should be mandatory for stores everywhere.

Fast forward one year (almost exactly a year to the day). I weight 135lb, and it makes me feel so ashamed and embarrassed. I know I might get flamed for this by people saying I should know better because I'm not ""fat"". But it's still the way I feel. 40 lb is a GIANT change, when you're adding almost half of the original body weight. 

Basically, I'm terrified and extremely anxious. It doesn't help that my boyfriend comes home from Scotland at the end of the month, after being gone since September. I've gained a lot since he left. He's already kind of a small, slim guy, and the thought of weighing only 10 lb less than my boyfriend is fucking horrifying. I feel like he won't desire me, and that he will be more inclined to cheat when he goes back to school in the fall if I'm unattractive. 



Please...I'm scared that everyone is going to discount my fears as not being valid, but just try for a minute to imagine where I am coming from. I've gained half of my body weight in a year. I had to. But I hate it, and at times still wish that I could be that little waif of a girl with no hips and a concave stomach even if I know it's not considered pretty or womanly, because I **felt** pretty and womanly. And now I don't.

Edit:

A lot of it stems from an ex-boyfriend's careless comment. When I was dealing with my eating disorder he said, ""It's not like you weigh 135 lb""...which was exactly what I weighed before my eating disorder. I have never been able to let that go.

My health issue and medication during that time was partly responsible for significant weight gain and depression didn't help in losing it. so i am overweight, but two years ago, i started to work out every day, i learned how to meditate and began to cultivate a more mindful attitude and loving kindness. 

the workouts were at first more lightly, because i was out of shape. nowadays, i lift relatively heavily (for me, anyway, as i only started this routine), i do cardio and i spend a lot of time and effort at the gym. I consider it part of my psycho-hygienic set-up and usually it helps me being balanced - it's ""me time"" for me. I feel much better than two years ago and i do see that my body is ever so slowly changing and it feels good. I'm in a better place than i have been for two years, most of the time even in terms of self acceptance. Mind you, i haven't lost any weight, but i can see and feel that i have become more muscular, and stronger - and hey, two out of three in terms of goals ain't so bad, right?

So today i'm at the gym and i am starting to do my squats and this guy i haven't even ever talked to walks up and comments on how lifting this heavy isn't feminine and am i even a real woman anymore? I shrug it off with a semi-joke or two because i am not sure how to react, put my earplugs in and hurry back to exercising, but i am already grinding my teeth. I even managed to use that frustration/irritation for lifting, so it wasn't that bad. he probably was just jealous because he can't lift more than i can...

however this wasn't enough, obviously. ten minutes later this guy who has been a fitness trainer there for a long time and who knows i used to struggle with depression and who also knows that i am not happy about my weight walks up to chat, so i take my earplugs out and we exchange a few friendly phrases when out of the blue he starts making comments about how funny i look when deadlifting because of my big butt. he then says a few other equally awful things and tops it off by saying that i shouldn't be sad about my looks because you can't be ""brainy and creative like you AND goodlooking"". 

I was stunned. I didn't even manage to tell him off, i just said ""well that wasn't exactly charming, i guess i will go back to working out now"".  The guy sure noticed that he had said something wrong and he tried to apologise or joke it over, but i just wanted him to stay away from me and so i said it's ok just let me work out now and put my earplugs in. he kept coming up to me, obviously not happy that he had said something wrong, but i couldn't deal with that because i felt as if somebody had punched me in the stomach. i could feel the implosion of self-hate unfolding inside me, i could even feel it in my lifts: this had physically weakened me. I soon left and went home and felt hurt and awful and cried, too.

 It's not that i want him to think i'm good-looking or anything.I don't think i am, either. It's not that that first guy isn't allowed to think whatever he wants - but what on earth makes him want to share these thoughts with me and make me feel bad about myself?  

For the first time in two years, i don't feel like going to the gym tomorrow. For the first time in months, i feel super awful about myself. I don't want to be in this place. I also want to be able to be better able to tell people that this is crossing the line - in a mature, clear, unafraid manner.  How do you guys handle things like these? Any pro honeybadger tips?

Edit: wow, just thank you so much, all of you, for your kindness and support. i've calmed down since my wall of rant here, and you gave me very kind words and solid insights and advice from ideas for my attitude, to great comebacks i can use in the future (I'll make sure to carry those with me wherever i go!) to practical tips - oh, and hugs, too! All much needed and gratefully accepted. 

I will have another look into women's only gyms, though in all fairness this was the first incident at this place in over 2 years, and generally the guys there are fun and respectful.  Plus the all female gym i went to before had some self-appointed and brutally outspoken ""body critics"" to it as well. So after having slept over it, i feel that i need to carry protection against these things within me rather than go out on a limb to not be in places where it could happen. 

anyway, i just wanted to say you helped me put things into perspective and change the energy of how i felt about this into something less self-destructive. I will now go and pack my gym bag and lift the shit out of that barbell. again, thank you!

Edit 2: Ha! Went to the gym a bit earlier than usual (to overcome tense feelings easily in an almost empty gym), took leftover anger with me, achieved new personal deadlift record and did an overall supertough, superfun workout. 
Also confronted guy No. 2 in a calm but very clear manner, explaining that i enjoy chatting with him but that i thought his comments were inappropriate and hurtful and to please not go there in the future. He apologised and said he had no intention of hurting me, that he appreciated me and was sorry, so we're ok now, i guess. 

to top it off another version of guy no. 1 (must be something in the water fountain) walked up to me about half an hour later and did another of those ""girls shouldn't lift heavy"" remarks and i didn't even bother to reply, just laughed, turned my back, did my lift and felt good about it. so with your help, i feel like this little crisis of mine has been resolved in a fast and furious manner;)",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,1353672084.0,,,True,t3_13mlah,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/13mlah/two_rude_encounters_ego_crushed_venting_sorry_guys/,

We're all wearing less clothing, which is great.  I love seeing men and women of all shapes and sizes wearing bright summer clothes. People are beautiful, and happy, scantily clad people are just glorious.

The trouble is, I've been feeling really jealous of the smaller-breasted women I see in tank tops and sun dresses. I know I'm being creepy, reducing strangers to their breasts, but they just look so lithe and lovely and carefree.  Some are even bra-less.  BRA-LESS! I just watch these girls-from-Ipanema stroll by and I feel so floppy and sweaty and envious.

At it's heart, much of it is centered around thinness.  I am not thin, and I'm tall, to boot.  I'm 5'9"" in flats, and I weigh in at 160lbs. I wear a 32E, and I have a big rolly stomach and thighs that rub until they rash.  I am currently trying to lose weight, and I've lost about 10 lbs since May.  I know that this goal is part of what is bringing my attention to the physical in myself and others, but that's really not a terrific excuse for objectification and self-flagellation.

I also just started rehearsing a play with two beautiful shorter petite women as the leads.  One in particular is very professionally successful and just bird thin.  Around them I feel like this hippo-Amazon with ludicrous breasts. 

So, this is what's floating around in my heat-addled mind.  I know that sometimes women with small chests or thin 'boyish' frames dislike how they look, but if you fall into that category, know that I covet your perky, bouncy, looking-good-in-clothes AA's, A's, B's, and even C's. Know that the grass is always greener in the other cup.

To be specific; the *lack* of weight.

I'm a generally healthy male, aged 33, and as much as I try, I simply can't gain any weight.
I'm painfully skinny, I'd actually consider it to be ""shockingly thin"" because it would make people look at my arms and go ""urgh"".
It's something that's really harming me because no girl wants to be with a guy who's so tiny, and this causes all kinds of psychological problems on top. 

It's partly because I have such small bones, but my wrists are just awful. They must be not much more than 2 inches across or less.
I can't be around anyone unless I have long sleeves covering myself up. 

What makes this even worse is that I went over to the US recently to see a friend (read: potential girlfriend/whatever) and she saw my forearms. She asked me on the train back to NJ ""why are you so skinny?"".
Yeah thanks. THAT helps a *lot*.
I felt about 3ft tall.

Isn't it weird that guys have to be in the middle? You can't be too skinny but can't be too fat either?
I'm not weak or anything; far from it - I'm much stronger than I look - but it just pisses me off that I was born this way and I just need to vent a while.

There's probably nothing I can do to improve how I look. Wrists will always stay the same size unless I manage to miraculously become fat.

This won't happen either.

Pff.

I’ve had social phobia and depression since my early teenage years. At age twelve I started cutting to cope with it—I’m twenty-two now. For one whole decade I spent my life in fear when around people, fear that people would mock me (and they often would) or think of me as less than human.

Soon, they didn’t have to say it anymore to me.* I* started saying it to myself.

I have retrognathia. That means my jaw is set back into my face, and it sometimes aches and creaks when I open my mouth or talk too much. It means I have a very small chin. There is a type of maxiofacial surgery to lengthen my jaw but I am inelligable to get this surgery, since my TMJs (Temporomandibular joints) have suffered trauma. This facial trauma is from when my father left me alone as a baby and I fell out of my crib, landed on my chin and cracked it open. Upon learning that, I felt angry, I felt that my entire life has been dictated by one moment that was beyond my control.

My therapist says I have body dysmorphic disorder in regards to my jaw and the rest of my body. I have always suspected this. It’s both a relief and scary to have this diagnosis. I felt hopeless. I felt that I was a monster that was unworthy of love. I felt that I deserved all the cuts I had given to myself over the year. I felt that anyone I loved would not be faithful to me because of how I looked.

Today: I say fuck that noise.

I just ate a bagel. I didn’t eat for a day and a half, and when I tried to I vomited either from anxiety about eating or what-have-you. I didn’t check the damned calories. I’m eating a bagel and I’m drinking coffee with soy milk in it. Didn’t check that either.
I have my insurance card laid out on the table, and as soon as I’m done posting this, I’m going to call and find a new therapist that specializes in BDD. I read about some of the treatment online, and I think it will work.

I looked in the mirror and tried to see myself not through the funhouse glass that I usually do. I tried to look at a whole, not individual parts. I didn’t cover up my face when I looked. I wasn't entirely pleased, but I didn't criticize it either.

I didn't cut myself last night, although I wanted to. I am not going to cut myself today. And guess what? I don't even want to either.

There is plastic surgery that I can get, a chin implant, that will help make my chin look a little bigger. I know plastic surgery is usually not seen as an option, but *for me* I am thinking of making that choice. But I will only make it after I love myself as I am now. And then, it will be my choice and my choice alone. I have already judged myself so harshly on this choice, wondering if I am betraying myself. I have judged myself too harshly on it, and I will no longer be afraid of judgement from others on it. When I make it, it will be made my me, because this is my body and no one else's.

I want to love someone else, someone very special to me. If you don’t love yourself, how in the hell are you going to love someone else (as RuPaul would say, can I get an amen?). So. This is me. I am posting an actual picture of myself, without a throwaway even. I never thought I could be able to do that. But I want to overcome, damnit. I am going to overcome. I am a strong, resilient woman who is intelligent, capable, worthy and I am awesome. I also have Spock earrings and naked ladylovin' mermaids in my bathroom.

My bruising is the worst it's been in years. I've been to many doctors, none of whom have found anything out of the ordinary with me. I just bruise easily.

I used to love the summer. I used to love my legs. For the past two years though, I have found myself dreading the warm weather. I miss the cool weather where pants, boots, and long sleeves made up my wardrobe. When I wasn't asked every 20 minutes by strangers if I am ""okay"" or, jokingly, ""is your boyfriend beating you?"" 

I had been planning to go to the pool today for the past three weeks. So I made sure not to sit unless it was on a couch, not to take any ibuprofen, even when my head was throbbing, not to drink. I wanted to enjoy some sun with ""presentable"" legs. I even started to use a self tanner, hoping to disguise any lingering bruises. At work two days ago though I accidentally kicked myself in the calf while walking. Sure enough an hour later, my semi-presentable legs were forming a large purple spot. As soon as I got off work I started crying, set my laptop on my lap, and drank some beer as I watched bad netflix movies. All that preparation for nothing.

Of course, my legs, though still better than usual thanks to all that being excessively careful the weeks prior, were ""ruined.""

Today...I said fuck it, putting on a pair of shorts instead of my jeans.

I was of course, bombarded with the usual looks of concern and awkward questions about possible domestic violence. But it was okay. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/d5Afi1R.jpg) is a picture of the gams in question.

I hate the way my legs, arms, and feet look, but I am healthy. Hopefully I am on my way to accepting my ""leopard spots"".

This resonated with me, and seems to fit the theme I often see here: Don't wait to start living your life. Don't let your appearance dictate what you do and don't do. Love your body. Use your body to pursue happiness.

1352933398.0,30,self.BodyAcceptance,137g37,School dress codes are predominantly aimed at girls and serve to negatively define them as individuals. Arguments for or against?,Epicfailer10,34,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/137g37/school_dress_codes_are_predominantly_aimed_at/,"(The is from another discussion I was having, in response to the idea that breast-feeding should be done in private, wherever possible)


One could argue our bodies are a core part of part of who we are, therefore saying that bodies should be covered up is attributing shame on our concept of self in an indirect way. Even if it is indirect, I think it has a real effect in people’s lives. I think they use that notion when they define themselves. By that, I mean, they take that negative connotation into account when they’re forming their opinion about themselves and their role in society.


That’s one of my problems with the typical dress code you find in schools… Most of the rules seem to be directed at the girls, at least as far as how clothing displays the body. (Not slogans/symbols on clothing.) :

-Shirts should not be too low-cut. 
-Shorts/skirts should not be too short. 
-Bra straps should not show. (My kids’ school says “proper under garments must be worn”. I don’t know what their definition of “proper” is or how they plan on going about checking…) 
-Pants should not be too tight. 
-You cannot show too much of your side (when wearing tank-tops). 
-Shirts should not be so short that they show back/abdomen.


Even when the rules could be applied to both genders (tight pants, showing abdomen) it always seemed like (when I was in school) attention was only called to the violation when the violation was committed by the girl. Tight jeans are popular now, but I doubt it’s noticed at much when it’s on a guy. If a girl bends over in the hall to pick up a piece of paper and her underwear shows, a teacher might call her out for it, but I doubt people would be as upset by it if it were just the waistband of plaid boxers that made their debut (vs. a thong). And along the same lines, I would venture to guess that if a curvy girl and a thinner, more ‘boy shaped’ girl were wearing the exact same v-neck shirt, the girl with cleavage would be more likely to be called out than the girl without cleavage. The v is equally deep on both, but one appears more ‘sexy’ than the other.


Because isn’t that the point? To cover up things that might draw our attention to sex? It’s hard to read the rules or see the particular way they’re implemented and not draw the conclusion that (a) the concern is with preventing students for thinking about sexual things and (b) especially when it deals with the sexual nature of girls. If so, I think that leads to several important points: (1) Sex is bad. …therefore (2) our bodies are bad, therefore (3) there is something intrinsically wrong with the basic part of who I am (physically and emotional/mental ‘urges’). In addition, it says (since sex is bad) sexiness is looked down upon, therefore (4) people who are perceived to be sexier are somehow (morally) worse than others. And since females are the biggest target of the dress code implementation, then (5) females must be the most guilty of the crime.


In my opinion this is condemning the female unfairly. My daughter is 5. At their school they can wear tank tops, but the strap has to be 2 inches wide. My daughter is a tiny little thing. A two inch strap isn’t a tanktop on her. It’s a sleeve. It’s Texas and hot for half of their school year. It’s practically impossible to find her tanktops that meet that requirement so she’s stuck in sleeves. I asked why this rule existed and I was told it was there because the sides of girls’ bras were showing so this helps cut down on that pesky (gasp!) bra. I doubt the administrators would be phased if a guy were wearing a loose-cut tank. The teacher went on to say that the dress code was to help keep the guy’s minds on school and not girls… So we penalize the girls because the guys can’t stop thinking about sex? By doing so, are we not making the girls responsible for the guys thoughts? We’re blaming them for something beyond their control. We’re burdening them with unearned, undeserved guilt.


I think it is equally as damaging that we’re telling the students that they are judged by what they look like. If the teachers/administrators are focusing so much on their clothes and the way their clothes display them, then what they look like is important and should be important to everyone else. What their bodies look like should define them to themselves and others. It’s internalized. As a girl, the conversation in their mind must go as follows: “My teachers define me by my body. My body is bad. Teachers are important figures in our lives/societies and are ‘right’ therefore my body must actually be bad.” 


Not only girls will pick up on this social norm- the boys do too. How can we get angry at boys for defining girls by their bodies if it’s perfectly acceptable for their male and female teachers to define them by/ focus on their bodies?


It plays into all of the other social norms. Girls are bad for dressing sexually but guys will be guys and think about sex. A girl who has sex with a lot of guys is a slut, a guy who has sex with a lot of girls is a ‘player’. A girl who walks around with 50% of her body showing is dressing like a whore. A guy who takes his shirt off on a hot day is just being comfortable…


As a kid, playing church basketball, the guys would take off their jerseys and walk around topless afterwards, but the girl’s couldn’t even have tanks for jerseys and our shorts had to come to two inches above our knees or we would be told to change. At church the girl who had a sexual ‘vibe’ would be called out for her skirt being too short when the dorky, awkward girl a year older than her with an even shorter skirt would be overlooked. I think that sends important messages to both sexes and it’s the girls who suffer the most for it.

I have always told people I was *always* fat. Even when I was doing tumbling, ballet, tap, and jazz as a little girl and into doing martial arts while I was in high school. I still am fat, and I probably will always be. My 'numbers' are all good... besides my weight, and I'm alright with my body most of the time. I think we all struggle with our bodies at some point no matter our size.

My LDR partner of three years is currently with me. He had never been to my home country before... and I broke out all the family photos so I could show him where I grew up, and my huge extended family. As we were going through them I noticed something. I  was pretty small up until I was 6 or 7. Tons and tons of photos of me running around smiling ear to fucking ear, happy wearing clothes that fit. Then come the pictures of my 8th birthday party, me sitting there chubby, not smiling, my eyes kind of dead, wearing an oversized dress and leggings opening a present and standing with my family behind me - looking over my shoulder my step cousin. The boy who starting molesting me, a year before. When I'd go over to his house to spend the night with my best friend, his little sister. The boy who would sneak into bed with me and rape me, and tell me no one would believe me because I was a slut... and if I didn't want it I wouldn't keep coming over to spend the night with his sister.

After that birthday party, the pictures of my childhood are few and far between. Mostly school pictures, and mile stones. My eyes are dead... and the smiles are forced. No longer did I wear pretty things, but over sized 'boy' clothes to cover my shape and budding breasts. Later in my teens I would still cover my self up.  At the same time being really reckless sexually... later I would take blades to my breasts and thighs so no one would ever want to look at them. 

My partner noticed something in the photos... and said they don't really look like me, but he didn't know why. All of this happened nearly 2 decades ago, and I am back to smiling and having my eyes light up... But I never realized that was the point in my life when I started getting fat. And I don't know what to make of it.

I was always a large child.  From the womb I weighed 7lbs 6oz, but I grew quickly - since I was the first born, my parents most likely didn't understand how things worked.  Every time I cried, they stuck a bottle in my mouth.  I was already larger than the other children once I started elementary school, and I was given the nickname ""Ms. Piggy.""  As a child, who fully understands that she's different even at 7 or 8 years old, that can be pretty harsh and painful.  

Bullying got pretty harsh in Jr. High and High School.  I was already a size 20 by the 9th grade.  I never dated.  I was pushed in the hallways.  I had things knocked out of my hands -- all because I was different.  I had the typical crushes, but all I faced was rejection.  One time, someone was dared to ask me out on a date but then laughed in my face when they told me it would never happen.  All because I was larger than they were.  I only had a handful of friends and refused to ride the bus in the mornings due to constant ridicule.  I worked hard to drop some weight, but it wasn't enough. By my senior year, I was a 22/24, and nowhere near what most people wanted girls to be at 17 years old.  I ultimately went to prom by myself.  Needless to say, I didn't stay long.

My entire life, my parents and maternal grandmother tried to help me lose the weight, but they went about it the wrong way.  They wanted to send me to fat camp and put me on medication.  I refused.  I didn't feel that forcing me to do something drastic like that was the right way to correct a problem I had with my own self-image... And I was right.

After high school, I decided to work.  I took a retail job and worked for a full year.  During that year, I shed 100 pounds through a combination of medication, being on my feet all day and playing Dance Dance Revolution at the local arcade. (This game is so hard to find nowadays around here.  The last time I really played it was 2004.)  I was a size 16/18, and I felt great.  Then I lost my job.  I took another in a call center, and without the constant movement, the weight slowly crept back on.  The hours I worked kept me from going to the gym at a reasonable hour.  I wasn't able to go to the arcade as often because I was also living on my own at that time.  Things had changed so drastically in a short period of time that I was unable to keep up with my needs regarding the way my body handles caloric intake.  By the end of 2006, I was a size 26/28, at 330 pounds, and holding steady.  

Regardless of my past, as an adult I wasn't having any issues regarding a love life, if you look at the fact that I had been engaged and also had luck getting dates.  My [ex fiancee](http://a6.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/35371_416173816066_800891066_4457792_633558_n.jpg) was also a larger man, but that didn't bother me.  I loved him for who he was, and he did the same for me.  Unfortunately, it wasn't meant to last and we eventually split apart... I returned to Nashville to start over and try to live life as a single girl for a while, but I eventually started missing the companionship I had with my ex fiancee and I started dating...

The dating scene was pretty rough.  As a plus-size woman in today's world, men are notoriously fickle.  I was starting to be ignored again.  No one would strike up a conversation with me.  I would try to strike one up with someone else, and after about 10 minutes the conversation would just die out.  Dates were tedious and often ended in either me leaving because I wasn't happy with how the date went, or me leaving because the guy got too touchy-feely... Don't get me wrong, I don't HATE sex.  I just don't want to do it on the first date.

The failed dates, coupled with all the negative media regarding overweight and obese women in our country, I was starting to feel hopeless...

After a spat of failed dates, I took to facebook to vent and found an old friend/crush I had not spoken to in almost 10 years.  We instantly struck a conversation and it lasted for hours.  We've talked every day since then.  One day I asked him whether or not he was seeing anyone.  He said he wasn't, and I asked whether he wanted to try dating me.  I was hoping he'd say yes, but he told me he couldn't give his heart to me.  I was crushed almost immediately.  I couldn't help but think that it was my body image that was keeping him from wanting to be with me.  A few weeks passed, and we got to the point in our friendship where we both admitted that we were both sexually frustrated.  A FWB type relationship started.  He obviously liked it, so after a few ""dates"" I asked him what he felt about moving further.  He said he still couldn't see himself dating a ""full-figured woman,"" and my response was, ""If you can get aroused enough to sleep with me, why can't you see yourself taking the next step and wanting to be more than just a booty call?""  He couldn't answer, and I think it made him realize how shallow he had been.  He told me about a woman that he works with, whom he had been crushing hard for but was too busy with another man for him to get noticed.  That's when I told him that he should stop looking for someone who doesn't want him and try to open his mind to the options he has available to him, that he shouldn't discriminate because someone isn't that ""perfect"" woman.  What is perfect, anyway?  

*Perfect is how we see ourselves, how we present ourselves to others and make that first impression.  Perfect is how we are at present, and how we are in the future and past.  It is relative; and no matter what anyone says or does,* **perfect is you... And sometimes perfect is right in front of you.**

A few weeks passed and he called me.  He asked me out on a date, and this time it wasn't just for a booty call.  He told me I'm beautiful.

**TL;DR:  You can find love at any size.  You just have to assert yourself and tell him/her that you are perfect the way you are.**",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,True,,,True,t3_mzfft,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/mzfft/a_personal_post_for_rbodyacceptance_for_a_change/,

I figured I'm comfortable enough with myself that I'd give it a shot, just to see what comes of it. :3

I'm twenty-four year old white woman. I'm five-foot seven inches and last I weighed myself, I weighed nearly four-hundred pounds. (Above picture would be from around the time of my last weigh in.)

I've always considered myself big. At birth I was ten pounds and I've just steadily grown from there. In fourth grade I needed my first training bra, in my year of sixth grade I grew seven inches. My height then stopped, but my weight continued. 

The first two people who would point out my weight would be my grandmother, and my father. 

My grandmother is tough grit and to this day will still pat my belly and snidely mutter ""Haven't lost any weight there, have you?"" I just sheepishly duck my head down and say hello to her, she'll give me a half-hug and then gripe that I've removed my shoes wrong, lol. I just take what she says with a grain of salt now, she's eighty-six and having hailed from the depression era, she had to harden up. 

However as a kid I didn't understand. She would force me to eat kale soup until I fell asleep at the table or felt like I was going to throw up. She would let my (5'1"" really thin) sister eat whatever she wanted. I remember one time she sat me down opposite my sister at the table while my sister hesitantly ate an ice cream pop and I went without. I recall my grandmother staring at me the entire time with her chin in her hands and occasionally making remarks like ""See? Good little girls who don't eat all the time can have ice cream."" Or ""When you aren't so fat, you can have some ice cream too.""

My dad was more relaxed on my scenario, but I think his favoritism towards my sister hurt more. He would pick her up and spin her around, they'd play fight. I remember one time he was in the mood to horse around with the both of us in the living room and I got shoved into the glass door. I felt tears well up in my eyes from the shock of it. He reached out for my hand and as soon as he had it, he jerked me up and started yelling at me. Telling me that this was why he didn't horse around with me, I was too big. I could have broken the screen door and he'd have to pay for it, or I could have hurt him or worse, my sister.

The other time I specifically recall with my father was when he sat down on the stairs above me and (known for his brutal honesty) told me ""Bubba."" (my nickname he appointed me) ""You're going to be starting to look at them boys soon, and I'm gonna tell you now, as long as you're fat, you ain't gonna find any."" (He paused then, and said) ""Well.. Unless they're fat like you. Or fatter. Than the only reason they're dating you is 'cause they can't get nobody better.""

I tried to hold back my tears from that, but I couldn't stop crying. That cut me deep, and only recently have I started looking back on that memory and thinking ""My father was full of shit.""
(Especially considering he walked out on the family.)

This is starting to turn into a tl;dr and my apologies. If, for some reason, anyone has questions about parts I've blatantly skipped, I'll answer them. That being said though, school was obviously horrible for me. I've been kick, punched, sprayed with a random assortment of things, I've had my hair cut, gum shoved in my hair, my things thrown out the bus window or stolen- even a hockey stick slammed into the back of my head.

Just for being overweight.

I've had my former pediatrician try to sell me on stomach stapling when I was eleven- for down the road, because according to her I ate so much my stomach had ballooned past where it should be and it'd never shrink on its own again. I was probably nearing two-hundred pounds at that time.

Then, during middle school I realized that if I acted bat-shit crazy, people would leave me alone. By random graces I was able to exude enough 'confidence' to attract my first actual friends, but unfortunately years of (and I don't use these words lightly) mental, emotional, and physical abuse by my family and peers had left me utterly disgusted with myself. 

I tried to not eat. I tried to throw up after eating, having seen both of those (what I figured then to be) solutions romanticized on television and in the movies- they didn't work for me. I tried to diet, to run with my father, and I always failed, and when my father threw us out and other occurrences led to my teenage world falling apart- I turned to self-mutilation. It didn't help my weight, it didn't help anything aside from giving me an occasional feeling of release. I was sent to see a psychologist about my (then) situation, which did help, until I was sent to see someone else who prescribed to me wellbutrin. Which didn't help. I was so stressed and depressed, I was making myself sick on a daily basis. SARB was called in due to my poor attendance record and I was almost shipped out to foster care. My case was dismissed however.

That was my turning point. With the friends I had, I decided to home-school and I thrived from it. I went to peer mediation and I learned that I wasn't disgusting. I wasn't some fat piece of shit that deserved the life she was given. When people felt they needed to comment on my weight it was because of their own insecurities- their own fears of 'becoming fat'. 

I remember hiding in the bathroom one time and hearing two relatively beautiful and thin girls come in and the one was obsessed with her looks, stating over and over again how she was 'the prettiest girl there', and constantly asking the other if she agreed. I realized then that even most 'pretty people' had their own lack of confidence and to see me probably reminded them of just how fleeting their beauty actually was.

I soon began to like how I looked. I liked my curves and how soft I was. I found 'pro-BBW' sites all over the internet and started associating myself with that sub-culture. I ate what I wanted, wore what I wanted, did what I wanted and I'd be damned if one of those 'skinny-bitches' was going to tell me otherwise. I was large and in charge and proud of who I was.

Then my third year in peer mediation we received a new girl. Probably eighty to ninety pounds, soaking wet. She was mousey and shy and I immediately figured that for her to look so emaciated, she had to be anorexic. I assumed wrong. That day the topic of weight happened to be broached, and I was quick to fight for the righteous side of fluff and ignorantly bash all the thin people out there- until the teacher (in her wisdom) interjected and asked the girl her opinion on my comments. 
The girl took a moment and eventually said that she probably ate as much as I did, from what I was saying. However for her, it was incredibly hard to gain any weight. She said she could relate with me on how hard it was moving through school, how hard her parents were on her- except for her, it was on the other end of the spectrum. 

I immediately shut my mouth and over the course of that meeting finally figured out simply: People are going to be how they're going to be. Sure some people can be unhealthy, or lazier than others, some can be totally energetic and healthy as horses- but their weight isn't necessarily an indicator of that. Their attitude is. If we are to take upon ourselves to judge any one person for anything- it should be for how they treat us, now how they look.

I eventually lost interest with the whole 'pro-BBW' thing. It wasn't my cup of tea when I realized that a good number of the guys who are into BBWs are like guys who wouldn't be- they like them because they're big, and a lot of them wouldn't be as attracted if they lost weight. Just like some guys don't find girls attractive as they gain weight.

Final word, apologies lol- but eventually I figured, I'm just going to be me. I'm not going to ever be a size four, and I'm not going to strive for something like that. I'm not going to diet, but I am going to exercise and be active, and I am going to better life choices when it comes to (what I do feel personally was) my addiction with food. 

And on an unrelated note I tell people: I don't want to lose weight to be skinny. I want to lose weight to be able to survive the zombie apocalypse.  :3


(Edit: tl;dr I was mocked and bullied all my life for being fat. I took too much of it to heart but- I got over it and learned that people are just going to be who they are- to judge a person on their looks only speaks lack of character on the individual's part. :3)",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,True,,,True,t3_l1hjb,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/l1hjb/i_saw_a_post_asking_about_personal_experiences/,

I was slightly concerned when I received the confidential for one little girl in my group because it said that she would be bringing her own lunch (lunch is provided), that she wasn't allowed to have snack or ice pops, or juice. When I called her mother before camp started she told me that she was watching what her daughter was eating because she had come up a little heavy on her last physical. I was a little disturbed, but figured if she just wanted her kid to eat healthier (she is a very picky eater and won't eat a lot of what the camp gives) then there was no harm.

Upon meeting this girl I realized that she is totally average (well not average, absolutely beautiful--but weight-wise nothing out of the ordinary). 

After a few days I became more and more disturbed by this mother and her obsession with what her daughter is eating. The little girl is absolutely terrified of food that doesn't come out of her lunch box. ""Mommy says I can't have this!"" If she thinks we forgot to bring her lunch box out she will start to cry, panicking. I became really upset about the whole thing the other day when we were in our 'cooking' class. We were making smoothies: orange, pineapple, banana, and orange juice. The girl starts freaking out because she knows she's not supposed to have juice. I tell her that her mommy would be ok with this, that a smoothie is healthy, but she is literally having an anxiety attack. I take her into the office so we can call Mom. Mom says the smoothie is fine for her and that she is ""so proud of her for asking first.""

I feel so helpless... I want to help this girl but I don't think there's anything I can do without risking my job. I don't know exactly what I want here, just frustrated I guess.

Someone asked me how I had overcome them. Here is my reply.

Overcoming my body image issues is something that I haven't done yet. I am still very much dealing with them, one thing and one day at a time.

List of Things That Have Helped Me 

* Places like r/bodyacceptance. For me personally, following chubby/thick/etc. Tumblrs full of images of lovely ladies whose bodies could be mine was incredibly helpful.

* Finding my own personal style. I used to try to conform to the college student (i.e. shirts and jeans)/Orange County (i.e. skanky tops, skinny jeans, and boots) styles that surround me, but have come to realize that I am what I am: a geeky femme who likes bizarre, bold, dramatic, and/or vintage clothes and accessories. I don't look like many other people and often am dressed a notch or two above others in terms of the formality of my clothing, but it's become my signature and I love it. I also know what flatters my figure best and makes me feel more confident.

* Faking it on days when I'm not so good with myself. People who say that confidence makes you attractive are onto something. It's not a magic pill, but when you feel good about yourself, you stand straighter, take more pride in your grooming and appearance, and smile more (what some call ""natural glow"" or whatever). That can do wonders.

* Exercise. Feeling strong, healthy, and alive is a good thing. I don't do it (necessarily) to lose weight, I do it to feel at home in my body.
Realizing that, in a culture where skinniness is considered to be the utmost in piety, every woman ever feels fat at some point. My sister is way smaller than me and way more attractive, socially speaking, but she freaks out about her ""big stomach"" because she doesn't have a six-pack.

* Follow-up to the last one: weight lost does not necessarily equal confidence gained. I weighed my lowest and was at my fittest when I was most depressed and had the least amount of things in my life that kept me happily busy (I would go to class, work out 2 hours a day, and then mope and sleep the rest of the time). I still felt ""fat,"" unhappy, and as if no one would ever want to fuck me, let alone love me. I didn't resemble the social ideal of hot and I never would, despite my hard work, and it really bothered me. So yeah, I don't labor under the delusion that weight loss will not necessarily make me happy, healthy, sane, or attractive.

* Lots and lots of orgasms. These don't have to be with a partner, but getting to know your own body, needs, wants, and general sexuality is very joy-inducing in more than one day. That post-orgasm wash of contentment hormones, as well as tingling all over my body, reminds me of why it's so good to have my body, flawed as it might be. This isn't for everyone, but having multiple partners (polyamory and open relationships) and BDSM have also made me happier with my body.

* Sincere, non-creepy compliments and appreciation from friends, lovers, and strangers. A smile, a thumbs-up, an approving glance, a well-timed comment -- things like that help me to feel awesome. Of course, you can't control others, but you can control around whom you choose to spend free time, and I choose people I like.",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_xd57o,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/xd57o/how_i_overcome_body_image_issues_xpost_exmuslim/,

I put makeup on, but I refuse to get up close to the mirror...magnifying mirrors are non-existent in my home, lest I see any wrinkles on my 22-year-old forehead or forced to see just how caked-one my make up is to cover where I pick my face (working on stopping).

My mom has always wanted me to get a nose job, and while I have given it thought, without my giant nose to focus a good portion of my self-loathing on, I will probably just grow to hate other parts of my body more.

1336437125.0,29,self.BodyAcceptance,tc2vw,Try not to laugh! But I caught my husband red handed looking at porn...(maybe NSFW?),,41,12,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/tc2vw/try_not_to_laugh_but_i_caught_my_husband_red/,"Warning... somewhat incoherent... as I really haven't completely gathered my own thoughts. I'm placing this here because this isn't something I'm comfortable discussing with anyone (my best friend would tell me to suck it up and watch porn with him, and my other closest friend would tell me that porn is evil and disgusting... so I'm looking for a healthy balance here.)

tl;dr: My husband is wonderful, but last night after great sex I caught him looking at r/gonewild, and it made me feel extremely inadequate.  I know it's normal for guys to get horny, but it made me feel so low, especially after we'd had a great night, it just felt like even after that bodyrocking experience it still wasn't enough for him.  I have not asked him to never look at it again, I think that is unreasonable, because me getting upset came out of insecurity (he also tried to cover it up which upset me as well.)  Sorry for the long tl;dr... it needs it's own tl;dr 
I'm not sure what I'm looking for, I really needed to talk it out with a group that could look at it from my perspective and tell me if I'm on the right track.  I don't like that he's looking at other naked women to get off, but I haven't figured out if it's entirely because I'm insecure, or if I'm morally opposed, or what...

A little bit of background on me... I was raised Christian... I'm a little shaky on that at the moment but I still hold a lot of the values.  My husband is an atheist.  
I have my own image issues (also continually recovering from an eating disorder), that he handles wonderfully.  I'm honest, I tell him when I'm not feeling my best and he encourages me in every way he can.  He knows that I always feel better after the gym, so he'll recommend I go (and this is an ok thing with us because I really do feel amazing after a good workout!) or he'll tell me how wonderful and sexy I look, he'll caress the parts of my body I struggle with.  He's amazing and I know he loves me dearly.


So last night we had wonderful amazing shout from the rooftops sex.  It was great!  We both finished, sweaty and wonderful, and I fell right asleep and he went to play some video games.  About 2 hours later I randomly wake up and he's not in bed yet.  I go to our office and the door is locked, I knock... nothing... I knock again (thinking he probably has his headphones on) and then hear him get up to open the door.  I see a blank google page.  Instantly I know what he was doing.  I could feel it.  I ask, and he says ""Oh the door, just habit, and I was watching gaming streams""

I let it go at first but then I ask him again ""Why did you lock the door?""
""just habit""

""Why did you clear your screen?"" 
""You're not going to let this go are you?""
""Are you lying to me""
Silence.
""What were you doing?""
""Nothing freaky I promise.""
""What were you looking at?""
I knew the answer before he said it, ""/r/gonewild""

Instantly I started crying. He said he was sorry, that he didn't want to tell me because he was afraid I would react like this.  It was a combination of being lied to (which I forgave quickly because I understood his concern) and feeling like no matter how good the sex is, I'll be unable to completely please him. That I'm not as ""attractive"" as the women on /r/gonewild, that he needed more stimulation than me.

Because I interrupted him during his... session... he was still horny, so after the breakdown I calmed down and we had sex again, partly because I was genuinely wanting it, and also, undeniably, because if he wasn't getting it from me he'd just go on /r/gonewild in the morning or something.  I am afraid that on nights when I am just not interested, I will make the decision to force myself to get into it, not for him, but out of fear or worry that he will seek it on reddit.  

In all the time that we have been married I have only had fantasies about him, it's just all I've really every needed, so it really is harder for me to understand.

I know porn is normal for guys, it's just that it's having a much more negative effect on me than I expected.  

My big question is, how do I navigate these new fears?  I don't want to feel obligated to have sex with my husband, I want to make the decision to get busy out of love and desire for him and to please him... not because I'm afraid or annoyed that if I don't give it to him he'll get it elsewhere.

I was medicated till the dr that diagnosed me moved away. I then got extremely depressed, kind of a denial about what was actually wrong with me. I didn't want to believe it at all. I went on two years without medication, knowing full well what it was doing to me. I just didn't care.

Fast forward to November 2012! I notice my hair coming out a lot more. I basically, (and quite literally), woke up with the mood of getting myself help. I was losing the one part of me I actually liked, and I wasn't okay with that. I've been medicated for the Hypothyroidism since January now.

My hair is still falling out constantly. It's half of what it used to be. I had waist length hair last year, and I cut it all off because I just couldn't stand to look at it anymore. The hair constantly fell out, almost in chunks. I sit around and cry because I feel completely defeated by something I have no control over. I try to talk to my mom about things, because she's the only parent I have, and all I get from her is 'try having it at my age and see how you feel.' She's 60. I don't feel like anyone understands what I'm going through or how I feel. I shouldn't feel like I'm 60 years old when I'm 22. I don't think she cares at all.

I was under the impression that things would get better after treatment. I don't feel any better, and the one thing I enjoyed about myself is gone. I chopped my hair off, and I still cry.

Although I tan easily and can get dark, I have never lived in an area that allows me to do so. I don't care whether or not I'm tan. I am more concerned about the dark hair on my light-ish skin. 

I don't care about my arms. I shave my legs, but the stubble is very noticeable and I have dots where the hair follicles are. The worst of my hair problems, though, is my lower back and butt. As I mentioned before, I have light skin, and unless I lay out nude all summer (and I don't) my butt is pretty fucking white. My hair is dark, and I have a lot of it down there. 

It really bums me out because I have spent a lot of time to accept my body *figure.* I work out, I have developed decent muscle tone, I'm fairly skinny, yet I still have great curves, and I love it. I love that I have a tiny waist and great boobs, AND a great ass. I say this because I didn't always feel this way. Now that I have accepted my figure, I realize this figure is covered in dark fuzz

It's like a mean joke. I find myself hiding it when I'm in bed with someone. I also feel like its an attack on my femininity because it seems as though every women doesn't have hair there. It just bothers me. It's not as bad as a man's hair can get, but it's still pretty damn obvious and I think it's gross.

One more note: I can't shave it because you'll still see the ""dots"" like on my legs, I'll get horrible razor burn, and so shaving just makes it look worse. It also won't shave completely smooth and stubble is way worse than fuzz.

*I'm sharing the letter for two reasons: (1) Writing it triggered a veritable deluge of emotion in me.  I'm feeling rather lost and alone as a result, and would like to discuss it with someone.  (2) I know that a number of people in this sub are in some way affected by eating disorders, even if only indirectly, and I flatter myself to think that the letter might shed some light on eating disorders.

Eating Disorder – 

Oh God, where do I begin with you?  I despair of you, truly.

I don’t like looking weirdly skinny.  I don’t want people to look at me and immediately perceive me as being ill.  I worried that this is happening more and more.  I’m a private person.  I don’t want to wear my heart out on my sleeve in this way, to be judged by every man and his dog.

I’m frightened that other people will see or feel my bones, so I wear undershirts under all my clothes to hide them, and shy away from being hugged.  I used to LIKE being cuddled, you know, but now I feel really fucking anxious whenever someone so much as touches my arm.  You’ve taken the pleasure of basic human contact away from me.

Speaking of relationships, you’re strained SO MANY.  You’ve made me be short with my mother, who is such a lovely person, and doesn’t deserve it.  You’ve made me feel proud of eating less than her.  Jesus Christ, I even feel good about myself when ____ eats more or looks chubbier than me.  In short, you’ve made me a secret adversary of my hardworking, self-sacrificing mother, and my innocent, 10-year-old sister.  And that’s fucked up.

I compete with my friends, too, because of you.  I have cruel thoughts about them being fatter than me, or eating more than me.  On the one hand, I’m jealous that they allow themselves those candies or whatever, but mostly I’m just proud.  My God, though, nobody should ever be PROUD of themselves in spite of their friends.  I know this and I try to keep these horrible thoughts as secret as possible, but c’mon—I shouldn’t be having them to begin with.  You’re making me terrible at interpersonal relationships.

It’s not just in my thoughts that you fuck me up with my loved ones, though.  Because of you, I can’t eat with my friends, and I’m rarely able to eat with my mum.  And even on those rare occasions when I do break bread with people, I’m always consumed by fears relating to calories and my weird food rituals.  I live in a society where eating together is meant to be fun, but you’ve stolen that from me, and have made me resort to strange, secretive food habits.

Hm, let’s discuss those for a bit.  Do you think that I like going for hours hungry as fuck?!  Or that I enjoy eating in a seemingly uncontrollable manner?  It’s terrible!  Sometimes I eat so much that my brain becomes foggy and I can barely concentrate on my work.  Other times, I’m so hungry that I have to down a bunch of medication so I can sleep through the discomfort.  I just want to be able to eat normal portions of food at regular intervals, but I CAN’T.  You make me feel desperate when it’s 11 am and I’m still hungry, and yet I know that I can’t eat anything until 6 am the next day….or repulsive when I realise that it’s 8.30 am and I’ve already eaten 1,000 kcal.

I feel pathetic, too, that my life is entirely centred on food.  The only thing I look forward to is the point at which I’m next allowed to eat.  Christmas?  A trip to Europe?  Time with my loved ones?  Cool, I guess, but they pale in comparison to the next time I get to have a piece of BREAD.  I might have a BMI of ___, but I am a glutton and a food addict. Everything has become secondary to food now.  I don’t even feel like a person anymore, I care about so little else.  I feel like an eating disorder with legs.  And I’m so ashamed.  

Shame, hm.  I sure feel that a lot.  I’m ashamed of myself for being too weak to have a normal relationship with food.  I’m supposed to be some high flier, but a piece of cake frightens me.  I’m supposed to be thoughtful and considerate, but my constant thoughts about my appearance make me shallow and unkind.  You make me lie to people, too.  I lie about seemingly innocuous things because of you.  “What did you eat?” they ask.  “Oh, so much food!” I reply untruthfully.  That these lies trip off my tongue now frightens me.  Dishonesty isn’t pretty.

And let’s talk about the purging.  I haven’t done THAT in a while, thankfully, but still.  Do you remember how I’d eat so much that I was almost unable to swallow?  Do you remember that feeling of dread when I realised what my only option was?  Do you remember the pain of acidic foods, bread, and melted chocolate?  I DO.  Thanks for the rush of endorphins at the end that’s ensure that I’d do it again.  And thanks for making me so efficient at it that I could do it before breakfast, in the school washroom, or on Christmas Eve, and so persistent that I wouldn’t stop, even if I was in incredible pain.

Oh God, and let’s not forget all the fun things I can’t do because of you.  I’m too scared to go swimming, wear certain clothes, or go to places where I can’t predict where/ when I’ll have my next meal, and exactly what I’ll be eating.  Holidays, restaurants, birthdays—everything—is anxiety-inducing instead of fun.  All I want to do is weasel my way out of “enjoying” these experiences. 

Eating disorder, the first symptoms of you messed up my late childhood.  They made me insecure and feel out of control.  I was a 12-year-old ashamed of my body, and of the food I put into it.  And then you completely fucked up my adolescence.  Remember when I was 14 and weighed __ lbs?  I was surviving on a salad and three crackers a day for six weeks!  Or how about Grades 10 and 11, when I had constant nightmares about being fat, and fantasised about carving the fat from my body?  Or how about Grade 12, when I first lost about __ lbs, and then gained them all back by bingeing and purging EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.  Now I’m 21, and I see a bleak future ahead.  I don’t even want to be alive, as the ‘life’ I picture is filled with insane thoughts and behaviours, and crushing sadness.

And look—here I am still, frightened to be rid of you.  Herein lies your worst trait, I think: no matter how much suffering you cause, I still WANT you.  You’re different from other conditions in this way.  I don’t want my anxiety or depression, much the same way I wouldn’t want cancer or the flu.  But with you—you reward me in these insidious little ways that make me cling to you, and become proud of you.  You want me DEAD, and yet I still love you more than I love myself.  I’d rather die than be rid of you, and you encourage me to feel like this.

Well, guess what: you’re winning.  You’ve been winning for the past 10 years, but increasingly, I see that the game’s up.  I’m in check, if not in checkmate.  Congratulations, you.  You’ve made my life a living hell, and have driven me to overwhelming darkness.  And what comfort do you give me, “friend”?  What do you say now, as I’m swallowed by the night?  Why, you wrap your bony figure around mine, and you whisper in my ear, “at least you’ll die thin”.

I hate you.

Very small breasts with a more curvier figure and 20 or so extra pounds of fat. I considered myself curvy and embraced. When I heard about r/curvy, I decided to check it out thinking it would make me feel better about myself for having some extra lovin' in my butt and thighs and tummy because those bodies were being revered by people on the internet I would probably never want to meet in real life. I quickly found out that these girls also had medium to large natural breasts to go with the package which made me feel like my body was somehow incomplete. It was like my body is like a delicious and fattening BLT without the bacon, it was missing the key element that would make it delectable. I was a baconless BLT and after all, all men LOVE bacon.

 I'd stare at them and think, ""Grow you assholes! Don't you want me, your owner, to be complete?"" This went on for about two years and there were no signs of ""improvement"" and occasional criticism about my doorbell-sized knockers so I got fed up, it was like waiting for that one person you just longed for the longest time to eventually feel the same way about you until you realized that it was never going to happen and moved on hoping that at that moment, they'd come around. I thought that if I accepted my petite breasts, that they'd magically inflate. Of course, that wasn't body acceptance. 

So I went the cold hard truth route. I got naked and looked at myself in the mirror and said, ""They aren't going to change. You are stuck with them. They are going to stay this size. You have small breasts and you always will."" I realized that it was this idea that they could change that made me want something else. I know I'm not the only person who thought something like maybe genies are real and I will find one and make them change my body. Genies aren't real, I can't make the fat in my stomach go to my breasts, and they will not get bigger if I just want it hard enough. They are what they are and I am not going to be Christina Hendricks. Ever. 
So I accepted that I am stuck with this. Well? Do I magically love my body now? Nope. I don't HAVE to love my body but I don't hate it. However, I accept it and no good will ever come out of not doing so. 
Once in a blue moon I'd think, ""Oh, it'd be nice to have some big breasts"" but I also think that it'd be nice to eat all I want and not gain a pound. It'd be nice but that's not going to happen. When you realize that reality will never be as good as fantasy, then you begin to focus on why you like your reality. I have petite breasts and I don't have to like them but what good comes out in hating them?

I was a very skinny tall little girl but when I hit puberty I proportionately ballooned, with DD cup breasts, wide hips and large bum. This came as quite a shock to my mother who was naturally small breasted and slim her entire life, and same goes for her mother before her. I am 22 now and ever since then face daily abuse from them both about my weight, and sometimes I'm not even sure they know they are doing it. I frequently get comment such as ""I'm thin, there's no reason for you to not be"" and ""it's a shame your a big girl, you could be so beautiful otherwise"", or my favourite ""every time I see you you've gotten fatter"", despite the fact that me body weight is quite comfortable where it is and hasn't fluctuated since I was 16. During my teen years at school I was ridiculed and bullied by classmates for being ""fat and ugly"" and while I no longer get this kind of feedback in the real world I feel I will always walk around with my head down so not to make eye contact with others.

I have become quite comfortable and confident with my looks and body. I think women are beautiful in all shapes and sizes but there doesn't seem to be many who agree with me.

I have lean't how to dress myself and love what I have. And generally over the years I have considered myself ""plus size"" but this has angered all my ""plus size"" friends. I've been told I ""have no right to call myself large"" and apparently I'm a skinny bitch? I received an angry facebook message from a friend saying ""How dare you call yourself fat, you have no idea what it's like to actually be fat. I don't believe you actually wear bigger sizes. You can't be bigger than a 10. Grow up!"" amongst other things. I never meant to anger anyone but until recently I have only ever been called ""fat""?

I'm not looking to fit into either category but I just feel whichever way I turn my friends and family don't accept me, which further makes me feel angry. I tend not to talk about my weight with others but whenever it comes up, it's always become a big deal with someone. What should I do?

In my city there is an amazing place that specializes in therapy for food and body issues. Over the past few weeks this is what I have learned: 

-constant dieting is horrible for your health

-reminding yourself of how much you weigh every day by stepping on the scale and posting pictures of a thinner you on your mirror is not motivation....it's punishment. 

-your body wants to be a certain size....and that's okay. You should let it. 

-calorie counting can result in obsession and guilt. 

-participate in exercises that you enjoy, not exercises that make you feel like shit. 

-it doesn't matter if you wear ""plus size"" clothes. If you like it, buy it. 

-loving yourself does not happen overnight, it's a slow process with baby steps, so be patient.

-you can be healthy at any size 


I'm sure many of you in this subreddit already know these things, but these are revelations that I have had since starting treatment. Since going to therapy, I have also stopped counting calories,  I have this incredible sense of freedom. Things are getting better.

(Wall of text and Possible triggers),whatthefox1818,31,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1cga83/big_blow_to_my_confidence_this_weekend_does/,"**Background:** For the first two years of high school I struggled with my weight being unhealthily low due to a combination of medical problems and eating too little. I was however very happy at this weight. When the medical problems were solved and I found myself at a healthy weight I was unhappy for quite some time. It took me until my senior year to accept the change in my body and embrace my new curves. Most of the time now, at age 20, I'm quite comfortable in my skin- but of course there are days when the self shaming from that transitional period in my life creeps in.    


**Story:** After a fun and successful performance with my a cappella group Friday night my boyfriend and I decided to go to a beach-themed after party hosted by another member of our group. We swung by my house so I could change into something event appropriate. Although the party was beach themed, the weather had not quite warmed up yet and I knew we'd have to do some walking to get to the place it was held, so rather than going in a swimsuit like most of the other girls from our group were planning on, I put on a beach-y tunic length shirt, shorts, and sandals.    


Because I was planning on staying over at my boyfriend's place after the party and there is no legal parking at his apartment we were forced to park at a garage downtown. We parked the car and walked down to ground level when my boyfriend realized he left the ticket in the car. He's much faster than I am so I told him to run back up to get it while I started out for his apartment (where he needed to change into beach attire too) because we both knew he would catch up to me quickly. In retrospect I should have known better than to put myself in a position where I was walking downtown at night alone. Many worse things could have happened. That doesn't make what did any less hurtful though.    


There were many people out and about, most at varying levels of intoxication going between bars and nearby frats (I live in a college town). There was a group of 3 guys walking down the sidewalk ahead of me at a very slow pace, clearly quite drunk. As I gained on them they started looking back at me and snickering. I knew this was a recipe for SOME kind of disaster so I picked up my pace and passed them in a well lit area trying to get as far away as I could as fast as I could. As soon as I passed them I knew that was a mistake.    


As I was ahead of them I'm not exactly sure which one said what, but here is what I heard them call out to me as I tried my best to ignore them and speed away.  
""Hey! Hey! What's up with that??""  
""Oh god. Fatty. What the fuck. That's just embarrassing.""  
""Sssshh. Shut it.""  
""NO. She needs to know! Hey! Yeah! You're embarrassing yourself!!""  
""Oh god. (laughter)""  
""That skirt thing you're wearing is WAY TOO FUCKING SHORT FOR YOU. Thank you for at LEAST wearing black whatever the fuck that is!"" (talking about my long shirt and black shorts)  
""NO ONE wants to see that from you!""  
""too HUGE!""    


At this point my boyfriend had caught up to me and seeing what was happening and that I had no idea what to do gave me a quick squeeze of a hug and started walking backwards between me and my tormentors. He was calm and in control asking the drunks if they were having a good night and that they shouldn't talk to a lady that way and that they should keep their opinions to themselves. But they continued on even as we sped up and got further away from them. I couldn't hear it all because they were all hurling insults at the same time, but a few I caught were, ""Fat slut!"" and ""Whale."" At this point my boyfriend was beyond furious and called back threatening to bash the face in of the next guy that said a word. He probably would have too if he wasn't more concerned with consoling me who he could tell was on the verge of tears.    


I held it together until we got outside his apartment building. There I broke down in his arms. I didn't want to go to the party. I didn't want to move. I'm not sure how long I cried there or when he got me up to the apartment. I felt like shit. Every insult I thought to myself in high school felt true. I felt worthless.    


Being the amazing guy he is, my boyfriend held me, listened to me try to talk through the sobs, and said all the things I needed him to to eventually calm me down and finally make me laugh. We even made it to the last bit of the party, which was a blast and exactly what I needed to stop my brain from reeling. That night though, falling asleep together, it all rushed back and he had to hold me and comfort me again for some quick silent tears.    


In these last few days, whenever I seem to have forgotten those guys words I accidentally look in the mirror and feel the sting all over again. And what's worse is some part of me that I thought mostly died in high school believes them. I feel like my confidence is shot and I don't know what to do.    


**TL;DR:** Body issues left over from high school. Now I'm 20. Three drunk guys followed me from downtown and yelled weight-related insults at me for several blocks until my boyfriend was able to intervene. Now my confidence is in pieces on the floor and I'm having trouble not taking what they said to heart. Help?

It's come to my attention that a lot of the issues we have in this subreddit have to do with some basic misunderstandings and confusion about what fat acceptance is and isn't and how it ties in with health. Someone from r/fitnesscirclejerk said to me that they, "" genuinely want to help others live better lives by being more fit, regardless of size."" and ""I am genuinely inerested in helping you be more fit and strong. I couldn't give two shits about your weight"". This is HAES. Exactly this. From a person from a subreddit which actively speaks out against HAES and reviles it. So let's clear some things up. 

 Firstly, you should know that all of the mods of this subreddit support both fat acceptance and HAES both together and independently of each other in addition to supporting all other forms of body acceptance. 

So what is fat acceptance and why would we support it? Well, fat acceptance is, obviously accepting and loving your body even when it's fat. It means recognizing that there is no moral attachment to your body size. Being fat doesn't make you less of a person or more unworthy of respect and equality. It means loving your body regardless of the size, shape, and condition it comes in. 

So why would we do that? Because we believe that you take better care of something that you love and because we believe that living your entire life miserable from body hate isn't a great way to live. Would you rather live with depression, anxiety, and guilt or happiness and confidence? I think that's pretty obvious. 

So does fat acceptance require that you be a ""good fattie"" who follows HAES? No. Fat acceptance and HAES often work together but they don't have to. Some people just really hate exercise and really love certain kinds of foods. Again- quality of life is what's important. And some people will argue ""but if you exercise and eat healthy then your quality of life will improve!"" well.. maybe for them, yes, but not for someone who is miserable doing those things. Most people in the fat acceptance movement support and practice HAES (maybe not perfectly at first.. it takes a while to work up to everything sometimes), but they don't have to. 

When fat acceptance and HAES work together: So, like I said, most people who are in the FA movement are also HAES junkies. A lot of people either new to the movement or simply not familiar with HAES think that it means any person can be healthy at any weight without trying. Meaning that we're all automatically healthy. Why do they think that? Well, for various reasons but we tend to think of thin people as automatically healthy even if they don't work out or eat healthfully.. so by saying fat people can be healthy too they apply the same standards of not trying. The problem is that they fail to realize that a thin person is not automatically healthy- their health, just like us fatties- is dependent upon their lifestyle and food choices. 

What HAES actually means is eating healthfully and exercising because you love your body and want to nourish it and doing so regardless of the number on the scale. 

[The basic principles of Health At Every Size](http://www.peggyelam.com/haes.htm) (HAES) as outlined by the Association for Size Diversity &amp; Health are:

* Accepting and respecting the diversity of body shapes and  sizes.
 
* Recognizing that health and well-being are multi-dimensional and that they include physical, social, spiritual, occupational, emotional, and intellectual aspects.

* Promoting all aspects of health and well-being for people of all sizes.
 
* Promoting eating in a manner which balances individual nutritional needs, hunger, satiety, appetite, and pleasure.
 
* Promoting individually appropriate, enjoyable, life-enhancing physical activity, rather than exercise that is focused on a goal of weight loss.

So how do you actually practice HAES?

* find and exercise or multiple exercises that you enjoy (if you really love it that's the best!) and do it as often as you want, as much as you want. If you really love it, you'll keep it up because hey, it's fun! 

* Intuitive eating- If you're following your internal cues then you're not going to gorge on junk food (at least not for long). Your body wants to feel healthy- it will want healthy foods.. you just have to listen to it. Sometimes it takes a while to really get back to intuitive eating because of years or decades of disordered eating. Eat what you want, when you want. At first this may seem counter intuitive but your body has probably been in and out of states of deprivation and has been fined tuned to completely ignore internal cues. You may, at first, end up eating a lot of the foods you've deprived yourself of over the years- it will balance out. Once you realize you don't have to hoard it because it's not going anywhere, then it won't be that big of a deal. This doesn't mean you can't make a decision like ""i kinda want a cookie but.. i think i'll have an apple instead"" because once you get the hang of intuitive eating the craving wont' be so severe that you ""have to have it now or the universe will implode!"". Just like when exercise is fun and not a punishment you'll do it, when healthy food isn't a form of deprivation you'll eat more and when treats aren't a form of reward, guilt, of giving in, you'll stop placing so much importance on them. For studies and more in depth information on HAES I recommend reading [Health at Every Size by Linda Bacon PhD](http://www.lindabacon.org/HAESbook/). It's a bit too complicated to squeeze into this space but it boils down to: eat when you're hungry, stop when you're satiated, drink when you're thirsty, and listen to your body for what it needs with the goal of eating healthfully. Maybe take a minute to read [this](http://www.fatnutritionist.com/index.php/nutrition-is-a-game-we-play/) post by The Fat Nutritionist. 

* Take care of your body. This means visiting the doctor regularly, reducing stress (body acceptance helps with this quite a bit), and, of course, eating healthfully, intuitively, and exercising regularly. 

* Stop obsessing over your weight. It's just a number and it really doesn't matter. While you're at it, throw out your scale and get yourself a [yay scale](http://voluptuart.com/other-goodies-yay-scales-c-7_22.html)

So let me go back over the main points or, if you will TL;DR

* you don't have to follow HAES to accept your body or your fat
* but you do have to accept your body to follow HAES
* being fat doesn't mean automatically being healthy (neither does being thin)
* you have to work to be healthy
* but that doesn't mean you'll lose weight
* and you can be healthy even if you don't (which you probably won't)
* Even if a fat person chooses not to follow HAES and they're in poor health they still deserve respect and have the basic human right to be free of stigma and discrimination. You wouldn't discriminate against a thin unhealthy person, so the same should go for a fat unhealthy person. 
* and anyway, health is not a moral imperative. 
* and, oh yeah, let me add that everyone has the ability to follow HAES to different degrees within the limitations according to their own socio economic, lifestyle, mental or physical health, circumstances. Doing the best you can with what you have to improve your health in whatever way is what's important in HAES.

If you do lose weight doing HAES- that's fine. It just means that *that* weight is the one your body works best at. This may mean you're still ""morbidly obese"" or maybe that you find yourself ""normal"" weight. It doesn't matter. HAES isn't about weight, it's about health. Just remember, just because *you* lost weight, doesn't mean everyone else will. Stop thinking about weight as any kind of indication of health, character, or morality and you shouldn't have a problem. 

got it? good. If not, you can ask questions but only in a respectful, sincere, and knowledge-seeking way. If you just wanna troll and say ""but omg deathfatz!"" then it will be deleted, just like it would be in any other conversation.

I'm so tired of adding up my daily calories, always refusing food like cake even on special occasions because I don't want to gain weight. I shouldn't be scared of it, I'm on the verge of being too skinny in my opinion anyway.

1: I found the pinklovesconsent page, featuring some very sexy and beautiful women. And the best part? The models ranged from very skinny to what looked to me a size 18-22 woman (thats my size! :)) 
I cant believe VS is showing girls my size as someone who can be sexually appealing. 

2: On How I Met Your Mother this week the stereotypical, comic relief Fat Chick was back, but she wasn't the butt of food/fat/annoying coworker jokes.
She was on a date with Barney. 
After hearing Barny say his number of partners followed by ""And not a single fatty"" for years, this made me have much more respect for the show. It could still let me down but fingers croased. :)

3: I work at a Starbucks, and the other day a customer asked what exactly a ""Light beverage"" was. We talked and I explained, she said she was trying to lose weight and joined a gym. I said I work out there too and would maybe see her. She asked if I had lost much weight since joining. This is where it gets ugly; I told her that I didn't want to lose weight, and I had upped my calorie content to maintain my weight after beginning my work out routine. 
She was SHOCKED. She began lecturing me about how unhealthy I am, how I'm killing myself, how I'm going to die young, ect. I was so shocked and hurt I trued to just drop it but she refused. Finally another customer in my Cafe came up and shut the first customer down. 
""Look lady, how about you leave the girl alone. Its her body and her choice. Who says she's unhealthy? Also, If you're REALLY concerned with health you wouldn't be eating all those chemicals and artificial sweeteners in your drink. So how about you shut the fuck up and leave? ""

It's difficult, because all the young women here look like they walked off the cover of Vogue. Gorgeous, thin, chic, interesting, not a single hair out of place. I am 5'10"" and 200 lbs with big boobs, wide hips and thick legs, not a small girl by any means. However I pride myself on my personal style. But even when dressed to the nines it's tough to not constantly compare myself with all these other women who are seemingly so perfect. Petite, slim, long silky hair, effortless style. 

However, on the other side of the coin, I've had a few mega-self-esteem boosters in the last month. Number one, it's been extremely easy, WAY easier than in the US, shockingly, to find stylish clothes in my size. So I feel like a badass every time I leave the house, and I'm quickly picking up on the French custom of effortlessly blending comfort and fashion. I feel amazing in these clothes, and I never feel like I'm a sausage trying to squeeze into it's skin- everything fits like it was made for me! 

Also, and this is something that NEVER happens to me in the US: I've been getting a LOT of positive male attention. I'm seriously like rolling in phone numbers. I always struggled to find myself attractive in my own skin, and although I could reach a point where I was comfortable and proud, I almost never got any sort of interest from anyone. But here, I go out at night, or even in the middle of the afternoon at a cafe, hell- I had a guy yesterday STOP HIS CAR AT MY BUS STOP and get out just to tell me I looked really beautiful. And it's not all just catcalls and pervs- It's people wanting to get to know me, people ""just wanting to say"" I look nice- It's amazing. 

So the big thing here is I just need to work on silencing that little voice in my head that says ""you'll never fit in here because you're not a size 32."" or just laugh and respond, ""yeah but this dress looks just as good in a 46""",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_10ajo8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/10ajo8/conflicting_ba_stimuli_associated_with_moving_to/,

Basically, I have a lot of body issues for various reasons.

I'm a tall, broad European woman who is totally unlike the rest of her family - my sisters and mother are extremely tall and very thin, I was always the ""Chubby baby"".

I am extremely receptive to the photoshopped advertisements and magazines you see everywhere. I have done my best to cut these out of my life entirely, however with them lining the city I live in and every corner of the internet, it's hard to ignore them completely.

Before I found my current partner - now husband - I dated a man who would tell me constantly how he found petite Asian women to be physically perfect, as they tended to have ""straight hair and flawless skin"". After dealing with this for a long time I began to resent women around me to the point where I could trust no-one, and compared myself to the women that my ex was attracted to. I tried to kill myself many, many times and never succeeded, to the point that I criticized myself for failing something as simple as dying.

What I am doing to help myself:

I had a year of psychologist appointments, until I could no longer afford them. (I'm not sure they helped much. All I really took away was that I'm not perfect female ideal and never will be so I should focus on being a good person.)

I try to tell one person I don't know very well that I like something about them every day (To help with my suspicion, paranoia and comparisons of other women.)

When I try on clothes, and I don't like the way they look, I tell myself that the clothes do not fit me, not that I do not fit the clothes. For so long I starved myself to fit jeans that didn't work with me, when I could have bought a different pair that enhance my shape rather than try and make me look smaller.

I do not insult or demean myself in front of my friends or sisters or other women. This is to help other girls who really do listen to what you say. If they look at you and think you're pretty, and you insult yourself, they will take that on board. If I go out shopping, and complain I look ugly or fat, what if my baby sister thinks she has to match up to the insane standards I set for myself?

I try to spend time with people who have good confidence rather than people who also have body issues. When I'm around people who are confident, I feel confident. They also don't feel like they need to insult me or bring me down because they don't need to belittle people to feel better about themselves.

What I need help with:

Whenever I work on accepting my body, I tell myself ""You're only accepting your body because you're not good enough. If you were pretty, you wouldn't have to settle for just being a good person. You could be a pretty and good person. You shouldn't settle, you should strive for perfection.""

I tell myself that body acceptance is taking the easy way out, when really I should starve and hate and cover myself in make-up until I achieve ""Beauty"" even though I've done that and it didn't work.

People tell me that photoshop perfection is impossible to achieve, but it's touted as being beautiful, and therefore, even while impossible, I internalize it and make it my goal.

I have all the knowledge to work through this. I'm physically healthy apart from a chronic illness that is now manageable, I'm intelligent, I'm kind, I'm loyal, I'm generous and hard working.

So why does it matter so much that I'm not a model who has then been digitally altered? Why do I not feel pride when people compliment things other than looks, but even when people say I'm beautiful I make excuses for the compliment, telling myself it was only said because of *Insert reason here*?

I've been trying to accept myself for eight years now, ever since my first partner showed me digitally altered porn and asked what was wrong with me to make me different to the women in the pictures. I thought I was some kind of mutant.

Now I know I'm normal and perfectly fine how I am - but the doubt, confusion and self hatred remain. I don't want to live another eight years hating myself.

For one, belly dancing is about the beauty of the body. Most dances look best with a pudgy tummy, otherwise you can't see the undulation of the stomach. Personally, I'm exactly in the average range, but I'm quite tall and long. I didn't like dance, because I felt like I was twice the size of everyone. When I started dancing in school, people would joke about giving me extra space, lest I smack into something. It was true, I've got long legs and arms, but it did turn me off of dance. It wasn't until I voiced these concerns to my instructor that she commented that I might not have the belly for undulations, but my lanky arms made for great snake-arms! 

Seriously, if you want to feel good about yourself, try belly dancing. It uses a lot of the body, and it's good physical exercise with almost no soreness or extreme physical effort.

Your moderators have all gotten together and decided to make a post to clarify a few things. This is not a subreddit about fat acceptance, thin acceptance, boob acceptance, male acceptance, disability acceptance or racial acceptance- it is about all of those things and a hundred more. It is about body acceptance regardless of the size, shape, or condition that that body comes in. We want to emphasize that, like all subreddits, this is a community made place. Posters submit articles and questions and images that they feel connected to, that tell *their* story- that means that if you don't see your story, or don't see enough of it then please submit- encourages others to submit. 



We, as your moderators, are doing the best we can to make this an environment that is friendly to everyone because the rest of reddit- well they really don't care all that much for body positivity outside of a certain ideal and even that usually just turns to objectification- this is why we believe this subreddit is so very important. It's a safe haven, a refuge, for people who need a break from the body shaming, the misogyny, and the constant bombardment of body negative messages. 



So I want to get into some of the don'ts of this subreddit. People tend to think that body shaming is cut and dry- it's not. It's so ingrained, so saturated in our culture that we do it without thinking. We tell fat people ""well it's your choice and you should love your body, but it's not healthy"". We tell thin people ""eat a sandwich! you obviously have an eating disorder!"". We give tips on how to improve someone else's appearance according to our standards, and tips on how to minimize or maximize certain qualities so that their ""more attractive"" parts show through. We, as a society, are all about deceiving through body masking because of an idea that a person's natural body is just not good enough. 



Because the issue has a lot of cultural, social, and psychological aspects, I want to emphasize the complexity of body acceptance and body shaming. The mods will often talk to each other about a specific post or a specific comment and decide whether or not it's a body negative comment- we have to have these discussions because it's not always clear. We have to think about how it effects others, the different ways it effects different people, the implications that could be drawn from it, and the subtle backhanded messages that can be hidden. In other words, *it's not easy*



It's important to recognize that body shaming changes from group to group based on social misconceptions. For example, someone noted a study which was posted in which the results found that heart patients who had a larger body mass fared better than those who had a lower body mass. Why was this posted? Would this be considered fat positive or thin negative? It was posted because there are different standards in place for thin people and fat people. This is where thin privilege comes in. 



Privilege is ""a special advantage or immunity or benefit not enjoyed by all"". In health that means that thin people are automatically assumed to be healthier than fat people. Though this varies depending on the level of thinness, all thin persons enjoy benefits which fat people do not socially speaking. No one assumes that you are automatically going to die of heart disease, however, fat people do get that assumption. So articles like this are challenging common misconceptions- and ones that are incredibly detrimental to the health and well being, both physically and mentally, of larger people. Even among larger people there is [a spectrum of privilege](http://red3.blogspot.com/2011/02/spectrum-of-privilege.html), so it's important to judge on a case by case basis instead of applying hard lined rules when we get into the gray areas. 



Part of body positivity- part of making it positive for *everyone* and not just yourself, is recognizing your own privilege. I personally have white privilege and able bodied privilege (again, on a spectrum because I am *not* completely able bodied but I can still recognize my privilege compared to someone who is less able bodied than I) as well as class privilege (spectrum again- I'm not wealthy but I'm also not in poverty). Recognizing how our situations differ from others and how others have it compared to ourselves is very important in understanding each other, in extending empathy and help to those in this community, and in creating a truly positive environment for all. 



The largest privilege denying that the mods have seen going on in r/ba is [thin privilege](http://sugaredvenom.tumblr.com/post/1295697338/thin-privilege-checklist) denying. Now, I'm not bringing this up because this subreddit is for fat people only- I'm bringing it up because denying thin privilege is a form of body shaming larger community members and body shaming is unacceptable. But because it's not one of those well defined, obvious, body shaming techniques, it appears to need some clarification. 



[Thin privilege means that thin people automatically have an overall easier time than their larger counterparts.](http://www.raisingmyboychick.com/2010/08/on-fatphobia-thin-privilege-and-eat-a-sandwich/) This does *not* mean that they have an easy time. It does *not* mean that they do not experience body shaming and it is *very* important to recognize that thin body shaming is not acceptable. What it does mean is that by ""virtue"" of being thin, they enjoy certain benefits automatically. This is seen especially in discrimination against above ideal people in our culture. 



Fat people receive worse quality of care in the doctor's office, they receive less pay for the same job, they are less likely to be hired or promoted, parents of fat children are less likely to pay for their children's college education, they have to pay extra on planes to go the same distance, doctors give them less time and explain less to them, their health concerns are dismissed and blamed on their fat. The list goes on and on, and this is only the direct discrimination. In social settings there are far far more privileges that thin people get. 



It is important to remember that thin is the preferred body type in this country and that anything else is automatically seen as inferior by the general population. Denying thin privilege is no different from a man who says sexism no longer exists and denies his own male privilege- or to claim that sexism is not harmful. It is and so is sizism which is predominantly perpetrated against larger individuals. Thin privilege denying *is* sizism and it *is* body shaming. Don't worry, we also don't allow any other privilege denying- because the only thing more hurtful than another group getting preferential treatment, is those people denying that they're getting it.

1356838416.0,21,self.BodyAcceptance,15nmzu,One black girl's screwed up body image. ,,30,9,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/15nmzu/one_black_girls_screwed_up_body_image/,"First time posting in this sub and using a throwaway. Wasn't sure if this was better suited for /r/blackladies but I thought I'd give this one a try. Let me start by saying I hope this post doesn't offend anyone but I really have to express this to someone.

I'm black. And I have a black girl's body. Yes, I know, there is no one typical ""black girl body"" but genetically we are usually more prone to hips, thighs, butts, etc. I also know there are women of other ethnicities with all of those features, but it's a bit more rare. On top of that, the standards of ""perfection"" seem to be different between the two cultures, which is why eating disorders are often considered ""white girl problems."" Black women that aren't naturally curvy are often referred to as being ""shaped like a white girl."" I hope anyone reading this can understand what I mean and not think I'm being a racially stereotypical asshole, because I'm really not trying to be. 

Since I started college 6 years ago I spent a lot of time around white people. I was a cheerleader on a squad with only a handful of black girls. I had lots of white friends, male and female. Hearing how my white girl friends talked about their bodies (I had never even heard of a ""thigh gap"" before I started hanging out with white girls) and seeing the girls my white guy friends thought were hot completely fucked my head up. None of them had hips or thighs like mine. At one point, I developed a little crush on one of them. He had once told me that he had never been with a black girl before. I thought he wasn't interested in interracial dating, but when I saw that he had started seeing a black girl the same complexion as me who was rail thin, I was crushed. 

I was never really overweight, but white guys still never seemed interested in me, so I discerned that I simply was not thin enough yet. Black men complimented my body all the time, and that was nice, but until I had gotten to a point where white men would find me attractive, I was not thin enough. I should mention that I've never been with a white man and wasn't necessarily trying to attract one; I just wanted to feel like I could. I wanted to be able to borrow my white friends' jeans. I wanted to look like...well, not this. When my extreme diet and exercise regimen didn't seem to be working well enough, I started purging. No one suspected a thing because black girls don't get eating disorders, right? Whenever I hear someone say that, I scream inside. 

Now I'm out of college and completely in love with a black man who tells me at every chance that he loves my curves. But I'm so unhappy. I gave up alcohol (for personal reasons rather than fitness), carbs, sugars, you name it. I got down to 130 pounds. Like many black women, I carry my weight in my lower body, so my arms are thin and my collarbones are prominent, but from the waist down, I feel like an absolute monster. I step on the scale and feel like I should feel victorious, then look in the mirror at my thighs and hips and am utterly disgusted. I've had many friends accuse me of trying to ""look like a white girl"" - turn on any rap song and all you hear about is big asses and thick thighs, but nothing about that appeals to me. In the back of my head, I know I'll never attain what I'm killing myself to get, but that doesn't stop me from trying. To prove to myself that it's possible, I've even googled ""black girl thinspiration"" and wouldn't you know, there's whole tumblrs full of black women that I feel like I should look like. I just keep telling myself that if I keep going, keep popping diet pills, keep living on protein bars and tea and waking up at 5 AM for boot camp, I can look like that.

Browsing weight loss subs, I can't help but feel like no matter how much weight I lose, I'm a white woman's before picture. And it's killing me.

I told him it was ok because you cant choose who you're attracted too but he went on to say it wasn't just that, because he DOES think I'm beautiful, (well, my face) but that for whatever reason he really needs a woman that other men find attractive, it does something for him and because I'm not what the majority of men would even look at twice.. well...

Sagging breasts are very common in my family and I obsessively try to fight that. I wear a bra 24/7, one with great lift to try and defeat gravity. But gravity always wins. My younger sister has perfectly shaped and sized breasts that I am extremely envious of. Whenever I hear commercials on the radio for plastic surgery, I consider it.

I feel like a hypocrite. I tell everyone I believe in natural beauty, but I am so obsessed with being perfect in the eyes of anyone who I may date/be with that I would consider altering my body to achieve that.

I don't mean to hate on those of you who have gone under the knife. If you can get surgery and feel happy with the results, you are amazing and more power to you. But, I couldn't do it for the same reason I don't wear color contacts -- I couldn't bear knowing that when people compliment me on the results, they're not complimenting the real, natural me.

I don't want to get surgery, but I also don't want to hate my appearance for the rest of my life. I know it's only going to get worse. If my breasts sag when I'm 20, I'm deathly afraid of what they'll look like when I'm 40. I try to love every part of myself, but it's hard to grow up with a tall, skinny, curves-in-all-the-right-places, perfect-looking sibling and not feel a little inadequate.

I never really noticed that I had it growing up, though it may not have become as noticeable till I got a bit older. But starting in high school when we had to get changed in the locker rooms before/after P.E someone noticed it, laughed and of course pointed it out to the other 15-20 guys in there as well.


From then on I would get ridiculed by people so much so that I would wear my PE shirt underneath my school shirt so my bare skin would not be exposed. I also would hate to go to the beach/pool or anywhere where I would have to take my shirt off.


Anyway this continued till I was about 18 and I was at a party, one of my friends saw it for the first time and mentioned it actually has a medical name, so I did some research and saw people needed surgery if it was too deep. Got it checked out and didn't need it.


I don't know what it was but after he mentioned it I kinda didn't mind it anymore. In 2010 I went to the US to work at a summer camp in my gap year, I was still nervous about taking my shirt off. 


The first time I did, people noticed it of course but they didn't make fun of me for it, they would joke about it but not in mean spirited ways , they just thought it was cool.


That was the turning point, I realised it wasn't such a big deal, so I started making jokes at my own expense, things along the lines of making people jealous that they couldn't eat cereal or do shots out of their chest.

There are many items in this block of text that many people may disagree with, and I stress, PLEASE focus on the main point of this story: which is how I accepted something about my body I cannot change.

This post is about circumcision. I was circumcised at birth. I had always been happy with my penis exactly the way it is until one time I came across a ""cut vs. uncut"" thread on 4chan (not /b/, by the way. Never go to /b/, it’s terrible quality, and not very indicative of what the ‘real’ 4chan is like). They say ignorance is bliss, and in my case, I learned the true meaning of this phrase. I always thought browsing the many different boards of 4chan had made me a more emotionally stable person. Nothing I read on the Internet could upset or anger me. That is until I came across this one thread. I was plunged into a depressive episode for a few weeks by a single troll post. Trolls in threads like that say things to circumcised individuals like ""enjoy never having real sex"" ""your sex life will never be the same now that you know” after posting infographics of the nerves in the foreskin. Now I feel silly talking about this, but this single thread and the posts that the trolls made really put me in a bad place for quite some time. Something I had always been happy with, my penis, was suddenly unsatisfactory. Sex and masturbation are very important to me, and my feelings toward the most important item I own in regards to these interests, were suddenly in chaotic disarray. First, let me explain a little bit about myself. 

I was born with a birth defect called a hypospadias. A hypospadias affects the penis and it involves an abnormally placed urethral opening, or as I playfully call it, the ""peterhole."" I had this defect surgically corrected at the age of 3. I am not entirely sure if circumcision is necessary to correct a hypospadias, but in my case, it certainly was: my urethral opening was located right at the meeting of the shaft to the head/glans. Even if I wasn’t circumcised at birth, they would have had to remove my foreskin because it was blocking the urethral opening that had to be closed during the surgery. So, if circumcision is “mutilation,” then my penis is extra-super mutilated, because they literally had to slice open my penis lengthwise and re-route my entire urethra. I have a scar running down the length of my shaft on the underside. When it’s flaccid, you can even see where the stitches used to be. As a result of this surgery, I contracted a Staph infection. According to my parents, the doctors said my penis turned green from the bacterial infection. They almost had to amputate my penis, but powerful antibiotics, namely, Vancomycin, saved my member. I hardly remember any of this… I have only two or three memories from the entire ordeal. I certainly didn’t realize how close I came to losing my cock. I’m lucky to even have a penis, let alone a fully functional one.

Fast-forward to me being a teenager. After puberty I discover my sexuality and I crave women. I remember masturbating frequently as a teenager, and pornography I could only access through the Internet on the family computer, so I had a bunch of computer tricks to avoid detection by my parents. I looked forward to being home alone, because that meant it was time to watch hardcore porn and masturbate. Also after puberty, my genitalia grew to their adult size, and I would later find out my penis is above average size: 7 x 5 inches (17.78 x 12.7 cm for the Eurofriends). I discovered something about myself during these times: my sexuality is a part of who I am, and I love it. Never once during any of these times did I ever once think I was “missing out” on anything. 

When I was 16, I lost my virginity. Sex was always awkward back then. I didn’t get good at it until college. I am average height and average looking, but I excel in charisma and self-confidence, and I’ve been told I have unusual taste in women (but I’m really just a chubby chaser/ BBW enthusiast) so I have never had a very difficult time getting a girlfriend. Total, I’ve had sex with 12 girls (14 if you count oral sex as sex). Not bad for a man that was born with a penile birth defect almost lost his penis due to a Staph infection. Up until that one fateful thread, I had never ONCE felt like I was “missing out” on anything. I had achieved the totality of sexual satisfaction.

Then when I came across that thread, for one reason or another, mental conditions were perfect for crisis. Before that thread, I always thought it was better to be circumcised than uncircumcised. My state of mind was this: the foreskin is a superfluous flap of skin that can trap smegma and oils, and creates conditions ideal for the survival of viruses and bacteria, so it’s cleaner and healthier to remove it. Then the trolls posted, and I read and saw evidence that sexual pleasure is greater in uncircumcised men than circumcised men. What changed was my view on the issue. The head of the penis is mucous membrane, not skin, so ideally it should be protected. The result of this new knowledge: I was plummeted headfirst into depression and unhappiness. For the first and only time in my life, I was unhappy with my penis. It was no longer my trusty old sidekick. It was a horrific, mutilated, emasculated sex organ. Every time I took my dick out to pee, all the thoughts returned. It truly was like my life was ruined because I read a single post. I was miserable, and angry. I wanted to strangle the son of a bitch who was getting kicks out of making other people unhappy and miserable about something they have no control over. Better yet, I wanted to circumcise him. 

I’ve always been very happy and self-confident.  I’ve never had many problems with body image or depression. People who know me usually describe me as being a bubbly, self-confident person. That is what complicated this whole issue: I didn’t want to be unhappy with my body… but I was. For the first time ever, I wished my body was different. I sought help on the Internet, which is a very bad idea if you’re in a crisis and self-conscious about something like this. All I found were propaganda website explaining that 100% of circumcised men die as a result of the procedure, and the ones that do survive never experience any sexual pleasure whatsoever. (I’m exaggerating but you get the point). I also wondered what it would be like if I was at a nude beach in Europe or South America. Would people point and laugh at my unnatural johnson?

One day I realized the crisis was over. The thoughts of unhappiness and dread disappeared. I realized feeling bad about something you can’t change is a waste of time, energy, and happiness. I was tired of being unhappy, so I finally found the strength to accept what I can’t change. It was because I was able to focus on the positives: I should be lucky to even have a penis in the first place. And not only is it fully functional, it’s bigger than most. Two of the girls I had slept with were grossed out by uncut dicks. If I was uncut, I would have never been able to sleep with those girls. And because of my penis’s unique history, with the surgery and all, I can offer unique perspective on the sexual satisfaction issue. My dick is extra-SUPER mutilated because of the scar and the surgery, and thus even less sensitive than most circumcised penises, and I still have achieved complete sexual satisfaction. The sensitivity of a penis has nothing to do with the strength of an orgasm: orgasms are experienced in the brain, not in the penis. Sensitivity just aids in getting you to orgasm faster.

I still get aggravated when I come across places like r/MensRights. I went there today for the first time, and 20% of all the posts on the front page were about circumcision. I opened up those threads, and what did I see? Body dysmorphia. I saw posts from men unhappy with their circumcisions, posts from men who I would describe as being “beta as fuck.” Men who would kneel before an uncircumcised penis, admitting their “mutilated” penises are inferior in every way, spending the entirety of their lives obsessed with a flap of skin. This makes me mad because I know there are men out there who are circumcised and happy with their circumcisions, but you never seem to come across their voices on the Internet. Their opinions are always discarded in a flurry of anti-Semitic remarks and links to propaganda websites.

When I have a son, I’ll leave him uncircumcised so he can choose for himself. That is the one permanent change that thread taught me. But as for my body, I feel much better now. Nobody makes me feel bad about my penis anymore. It is beautiful in its own way, and its unique history makes it one of a kind. It is large and capable of giving women pleasure. Using it, I have achieved sexual gratification. I realized that while others are calling my penis mutilated on the internet, I'm too busy bringing my girlfriend to orgasm with my sleek, sculpted pecker to care. So try not to spend time worrying about whose penis is better, and certainly don’t spend time trying to find validation from strangers online, and be happy with the penis you have.",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,1344311790.0,,,True,t3_xsqsl,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/xsqsl/ignorance_is_bliss_my_rollercoaster_of_emotions/,

My measurements are 34-29-37 --by those numbers, you'd think I'd have something going on, but no: AA cup, hardly any waist or hips, and a pancake ass. 5'0 and 110 lbs to boot. Really sexy, isn't it?

I hate my body so much and find it embarassing to have no curves at my age. I hate needing validation from others about how I look (especially men), but that's the thing -- I thrive on that validation somehow. It kills me to see men go after curvier women while I'm left there alone. I want to feel attractive and desired like those women do.  But instead, I'm stuck feeling like a freak who never got a visit from the estrogen fairy or something. 

I've tried working out -- doing the whole squats/lunges to build a bigger ass, toning my abs, etc. Nothing happened. In fact, I feel like I've become even more skinny. I've tried eating more -- the weight all goes to my stomach. It's hopeless. I look prepubescent and not womanly at all.

Curvier women believe that the media portrays thin and petite to be desirable, but to me, it's just the opposite. I hear all the time that I'm not a ""real woman,"" that guys want ""something to hold on to,"" that I'm not even worth anyone's time if I don't have a gorgeous face, huge tits and ass, and small waist. It's very exhausting and frustrating. At this point, I've basically accepted that I'm going to be alone for the majority of my life, in some kind of sexless hell for skinny girls or something. And then I feel guilty for feeling this way -- I mean, basing my self-image on others? Even in this state, I know that it's very high school. Yet my feelings seem beyond my control.

I'm so sorry for the long rant. I just need to know some way that will help me feel better about myself, because I'm so sick of crying and feeling like a piece of crap for things that are out of my control.

I've battled with my weight since I was eight years old. I had an eating disorder as a teenager. I've had depression since my teens. Historically, I've had a terrible relationship with my body. 

Several weeks ago I got married. When I started planning the wedding, I made a conscious decision not to lose weight for the wedding. I didn't want the experience of preparing for my wedding to be marred by my obsession with not being thin enough. It was hard. Having pictures done was a difficult experience for me. But on my wedding day, I made a commitment to myself: I am not going to judge myself today. Today, I am marrying my sweetheart. I am intelligent, kind, valuable, and, yes, beautiful. 

It worked. I felt beautiful. It didn't matter that I weigh more than my husband. It didn't matter that my dress was a size 22. What mattered was the fact that my husband and I fucking love each other. 

I wouldn't say that my wedding was the happiest day of my life--I don't want to limit myself like that, when I've still got most of my life left to live. But it was a gloriously happy day. And it was definitely a watershed moment in my relationship with my body. 

Since then I've tried to take the same approach to my body every day. When I catch myself thinking negative thoughts about my body, I remind myself--I am not judging myself today. And it helps. That one commitment to myself has done more for my body image than a decade of dieting has. This morning I looked at myself in the mirror and genuinely liked what I saw. I feel hot, sexy, beautiful. There is more to me than what I look like or whether some guy finds me sexy--which, by the way, my husband most certainly does. I still have days when I hate my body, but I think I'm on my way to true acceptance of myself. I'm beginning to let go of the negativity and simply remind myself--no judging. I am not judging myself today. ",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_1e0g11,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1e0g11/i_am_not_judging_myself_today/,

I watched the documentary ""The Perfect Vagina"" and started feeling way better about it... I geared my self up and grabbed a mirror convincing myself it would look better after having a perspective/attitude adjustment from watching the video. I was optomistic...But when I looked in the mirror the same sinking feeling came right back and I couldnt help but think that I have an ugly vagina. 
Something similar has happened with a website called ""The love of large labia"" it is dedicated to helping women appreciate their larger labia and the same thing will happen.

My looks dictate my life. I do not consider myself a vain or conceited person, quite the opposite, but I do place way too much emphasis on my looks when it comes to self-esteem and productivity. 

On a bad day I am an introverted wreck and get agitated when someone tries to interact with me. I feel I'm being judged and my self-worth is somehow related to my how I'm perceived. I have 0 confidence (because this shirt does not bring out my good features.) Sometimes someone I like passes by, and I want to scream out ""this is not really me, don't look at me today, I'll be ""myself"" tomorrow, you'll see.

There is no middle ground. On a rare good day, I want to talk to everyone and revel in my surroundings. I'm cracking jokes, making people laugh, and I think to myself ""wow if I could look this good everyday, I could actually have a fantastic social life.""

In reality I know this is not the case. I see people who I would consider far less attractive than me by my standards (this sounds bad but I can't think of an honest nice way of saying it) and they are happy, sociable, successful, flirting with others I would consider way out of my league. And they flirt back.


These people all have confidence and I have none. My only source of confidence comes from my hair falling the right way. I feel shallow, but I REALLY don't want to feel this way, to have this outlook. My brain knows my worth is not determined by my looks, but I can't train myself to believe it.

So I ask you , how do I decouple my self-esteem (and others' self-worth) from appearance? 



-EDIT: It seems many of you assumed that I am a female (and understandably so given the forum and the stereotypical context), but I am not.  I am a successful business professional (and I say this to emphasize that I'm not a confused teen; I feel that should have outgrown this superficial mentality), who would probably be mocked by my peers if they knew what I have disclosed here. I feel that it is important to let it be known that social pressures of this nature affect men as well, albeit to a lesser extent. I do recognize, that with the current state of media, women are much more prone to this type of cognitive misdirection, and empathize with that. 

I'd like to genuinely thank everyone for their candid responses, I gained quite a bit of insight. I think it's time to work on myself in so many other ways I've been neglecting, and hope I can build a more solid foundation, where appearance is only a small facet of how I define myself.",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,1339919279.0,,,True,t3_v59bx,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/v59bx/what_builds_confidence_and_where_can_i_get_some/,

Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.

I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size

But when I start to tell them,

They think I'm telling lies.

I say,

It's in the reach of my arms

The span of my hips,

The stride of my step,

The curl of my lips.

I'm a woman

Phenomenally.

Phenomenal woman,

That's me.


I walk into a room

Just as cool as you please,

And to a man,

The fellows stand or

Fall down on their knees.

Then they swarm around me,

A hive of honey bees.

I say,

It's the fire in my eyes,

And the flash of my teeth,

The swing in my waist,

And the joy in my feet.

I'm a woman

Phenomenally.

Phenomenal woman,

That's me.


Men themselves have wondered

What they see in me.

They try so much

But they can't touch

My inner mystery.

When I try to show them

They say they still can't see.

I say,

It's in the arch of my back,

The sun of my smile,

The ride of my breasts,

The grace of my style.

I'm a woman


Phenomenally.

Phenomenal woman,

That's me.


Now you understand

Just why my head's not bowed.

I don't shout or jump about

Or have to talk real loud.

When you see me passing

It ought to make you proud.

I say,

It's in the click of my heels,

The bend of my hair,

the palm of my hand,

The need of my care,

'Cause I'm a woman

Phenomenally.

Phenomenal woman,

That's me.

I posted this in another sub, but it was suggested that I cross post here, so that's what I'm doning. :) I hope you have some kind words or else just sympathy for me.

I entered a costume contest recently. I was a character from a cartoon show, and I submitted my picture to said cartoon's blog's Facebook page to be entered to win a prize for best costume. Little did I realize, however, how much open scorn, body policing, and just general HATE I would receive for doing so. It's ridiculously depressing.

The thing is, I'm used to receiving internet hate mail - I mean, I'm a feminist redditor, after all. But this is so much worse than what I've dealt with on Reddit, in a way, because they're commenting on my body, not my viewpoints. My body, which I beat up and cut and starved for half my life. My BODY, which I've worked hard to feel comfortable with, which I'm feeding regularly and exercising and making peace with. MY body, which THEY have no fucking right to comment on. It's a goddamn costume contest, not a MODEL contest. I know it's probably just projection. I know they are just assholes. And I defended myself, and I have received some ""likes"" for my defenses. But there is always more of them than me. And it's overwhelming.

Also, of all the pictures in the contest (and there are many) only myself and one other has received such scorn and derision. The other is another woman, who is, incidentally, dressed in the same costume as me. But, there's only one comment on hers, and I don't even know how many on mine. All of the others have no such open hatred, though there are some gross and lewd comments (but are still ""positive"").

The photo is not in my control - it is in the album of the cartoon blog's facebook page, so I can't remove it myself - I can't send them a private message, either, I'd have to post it on the open forum, which would, in turn, open me up for more hate-filled nonsense comments. And I wonder, if I could remove it, should I? I think I would. But then it feels like they win. They win, with their cruel words and nasty comments. It would create a chilling effect. But then, the chilling effect has already succeeded. I won't be posting in any costume contests, ever again, even if my costume if fucking BOMB (which it was, this year. I spent a lot of time on it). But yeah. I'm just looking for...words of advice. Or sympathy. Because people on the internet can be assholes. 

TL;DR - Entered a costume contest. People on the internet talking shit about my body. Feels bad. What do?

EDIT: THANK YOU ALL for your kind words! I messaged the contest people and told them to take the picture down. I also told them that they should put in place rules or guidelines to commenters to only comment on the COSTUMES, not the models. We'll see if they listen.

I am not overweight, and I am sort of muscular, but I just don't have a good looking face. Everytime I see a good looking person at school, the gym, or the pool, it makes me realize how bad I look.
I have become extremely depressed about this in the past few months. All i can think about every second is how I am not good looking or even cute. Its gotten so bad I can hardly function anymore and I am actually considering killing myself, which I have never considered before. Everyday is now a battle for me, I cant stand it anymore. Whenever I see a good looking person in public, I get so jealous and sad.
I know this is a dumb reason to be depressed because I dont have any ""real"" reasons to be depressed and that I should not care this much about how I look, but for some reason it just bothers me so much. Everyone keeps telling me its not whats on the outside that counts, and that everyone is beautiful, and stuff like that. But I dont really buy any of that.
I feel like only good looking people deserve to be happy. The problem is that other things that I have been depressed about in the past I was able to fix and not be depressed anymore, but looks is something that you don't have much control over so I cant fix that problem.
Because I know that I will never be good looking, I feel like my life is pointless and that there is no reason for be to be alive anymore.

The first thought that came to mind was my friend's. She was tall, curvy, had a pudge, and very well proportioned. I was surprised because I had expected to pick someone...skinner. 

I don't look that much different from my friend, just shorter. This winter, I gained a little extra weight in places I don't like (like my neck/face), and I feel hyper aware of it from the moment I wake up. Then I realized that it wasn't like she was ridiculously thin, she had it too. I started to feel a little bit better about it. I still want to shed the extra pounds, but a little excess weight isn't the end of the world like I've been thinking. 

I can't believe it's been almost 4 years to the day since she passed away, and I miss her like crazy. Even when she was alive, I admired her ability to wear and eat whatever *she* wanted. She encouraged me to be myself, regardless of what other people thought. I tried to emulate that after she passed too, but it's hard when life and insecurities takes over. She was a free spirit, and felt like the big sister I always wished I had.

I feel like this is a small epiphany in the right direction, towards body acceptance. But not only that, for remembering her as she was, not just the last few months. It's amazing how all these years later, she continues to inspire me.

But it really got me thinking... everyone should be accepted.  I'll acknowledge that it's been a long night of drinking and my rambling may not be coherent but right now, before I went to bed, I did something equally superficial as making myself throw up my dinner.  I banged out a quick set of pull-ups on the bar I have in my bathroom door.

Why should you be ashamed of doing pull-ups before bed?  You should be proud that you can do them... 90% of the people here can't and it's an accomplishment.   Well maybe, just like you, it's because I'm not satisfied with my image.   I don't think I'm good enough.  I'm scared of people's images of me.  When I first met my girlfriend, I had big arms and a six pack.  Don't worry; I used a throwaway so this isn't a humbebrag. My friends also noticed the change and that became part of my image... the guy whose always running or lifting or whatever.  So you have a good body - why bother posting in BA?  Because, to share a drunken fear with you all, I am terrified.  I'm so scared of missing a gym week, so scared of losing what I've made of myself.  Will my girlfriend be disappointed if one day I show up with a flat stomach and skinny arms? (naturally high metabolism)  Will my friends think I'm lazy and apathetic if I stop going to the gym to spend more time with them or at home?  I decided that today, I would skip the gym and work on my car and clean my house, and the feeling of guilt that I hadn't worked out, and the fear of being judged for my image deteriorating led me to try and do the only thing I can do to work out at the end of the day.  Is this healthy?  Of course not.

I guess the point of my incoherent rambling is, I see a lot of fit hate here and I don't think that it's understood that insecurity may reign supreme in these people also.  When we look in the mirror, we too see something that we are ashamed of, and that is not ok.  Body acceptance does not mean that just fat people and skinny people should be OK with how they look; it means that everyone should be OK with how they look.  I know that a lot of fit people in the gym are d-bags, but I can assure you that just as many are equally insecure about themselves as you all are.  

A lot of times, when I come in here, I feel guilty for being in good shape.  But, being in good shape, I also feel guilty about not being in great shape.  And, being in good shape, I also feel scared to let myself no longer be in good shape.  All of these are unhealthy things, and I guess the point of coming in here is to urge you to not judge a book by its cover.  Discriminating against someone for being fit is just as wrong as discriminating against someone for being under/over weight... they too may have the same body images that you possess.

Given the extreme out of pocket costs ($25,000-$50,000+) I'll likely never afford surgery.

My hatred of my own body has spawned so much shame and humiliation, that I've developed agoraphobia. I leave the house for 1 hour a week, to see my therapist, where all I do is cry. I don't have any friends (literally none, my last friend has devolved into telling me it's all in my head, just get over it, only you can do anything, etc., etc., etc.), and the few support groups I've sought out have all been depressing and negative.

I can barely even browse reddit now, since random pictures of normal women showing up will reduce me to tears of jealousy and self-loathing. And on a rare good day, when I try to leave the house, the shame and anxiety of being pre-op, dealing with tucking my genitals (and panic when it comes undone, and it always does, multiple times) is overwhelming. I get home and just cry for hours.

1336781538.0,19,self.BodyAcceptance,tizme,"Hi girls, here are tips/advices that helped me to love and accept my body the way it is.  Wanted to share this with you, hope it will be helpful !",pennylanemiller,25,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/tizme/hi_girls_here_are_tipsadvices_that_helped_me_to/,"Hi everybdy,

First of all, I'm not a native english speaker, so maybe some things will not be very correct, I apologize for it !

I hated my body since I was a kid. I've never been overweighted, but I always felt like. I think many girls would relate to this : I started getting interested in diets since I was 10, maybe younger. I made my first diet at 11 or 12, and from that day, It never started. 
I finally realized that my body had NOTHING wrong, I just had to love it. And even if I'm still struggling some days with how ugly I feel, I've learn many ""tips"" over the years that help me on difficult days. 

This is only based on my own experience, it is not an absolute truth - only what worked for me. We are all different, so not everything here applies to everybody, but if only one phrase helps you, I will have achieve something ! 
Here it is, Hope it will help !

- SPORT. This is what had worked the best for me. Recconects you with your body. And this is not at all about how muscular you look if you exercise - I actually don't exercise enough for that. But whenever I feel fat, ugly, gross... I go jogging. I ALWAYS feel better after that, because it reminds you that your body is effective, healthy, and that you're doing something good for it. Plus, when you exercice on a regular basis, you will notice the positive effects very quickly. More strenght, less difficulties to breathe, carry your groceries etc. Makes you feel glad and confident. 
Also, the endorphines your body produces after exercise are the best thing to cheer you up.

- EAT HEALTHY. Same thing than for sports : not for being thinner or anything. Just because it feels good to know you're doing something good for your body. Also, as sport, it gives you more energy ; you will also sleep better, and be in a better mood, and be more encline to be positive about your body (and other things too)
But eating healthy doesn't mean you have to feel bad when you eat somethin that is supposed to be ""bad"" for the body; on the contrary, enjoy and appreciate it. Don't feel ashamed. Enjoy all the pleasure it will procures you. Don't blame yourself !!

- Stop reading magazines. Top models are not reality. First of all, they are maybe like 0.1% of the female population, AND they are photoshoped. Bodies like that are NOT reality. Focus on real women, friends, relatives, people you see in the street.
Real people, with their own defects. Focus on how people can be beautiful and attractive even if their faces and bodies are not perfect. 

- Think positive. It had been said and said so I'm not gonna extend a lot about it, and their are a lot of very good posts and comments here about that. It's truly working. Anytime you think something bad about your body, think about something good about it. like ""No, my legs are beautiful the way they are, because they are mine, I love them
the way they are. Plus, my skin here is really soft""

- Don't get caught by the fashion industry. I don't know how to formulate it, but just don't let magazines and stuff like that tell you how you're supposed to look.
You're supposed to look the way you are, you are beautiful, you deserve to love you the way you are, people are supposed to accept you the way you are (and if they don't, well, foret them, they don't deserve your love and friendship)

- Read books about how women have been ""trained"" from ages to hate their bodies. The best book I read about it is [""*Mon corps est un champ de bataille*""](http://ma.colere.free.fr/spip.php?rubrique4)  (""*My body is a battlfield*"") Don't know if there is a enlish version of this one, but I'm sure there are other books of that kind. Shortcut : We are women, and society always wanted us to hate our own bodies. People in r/feminism would certainly be better than me to explain it,  but as women we have been taught very young that we are supposed to suffer to be beautiful, find a man, and have babies. because after all, we are only here to carry babies and give birth in suffering. Our bodies are made to suffer, they are supposed to be painful. THAT IS FUCKING UNTRUE. Your body is supposed to be your ally, not your ennemy. It is not here to be a source of pain, but a source of joy.

- SEX. My sexlife was not really great when I hated my body. Not confident with your body = not relaxed in bed = bad sex = low self esteem ( "" I can't even appreciate sex, I'm so not feminine, I'm ugly etc...)""
Better self esteem in your body = more confident in bed = better sex = gain in self confidence etc...
Plus, sex = endorphines. And endorphines are really, really good because they make you feel relax and good in your body.

- KNOW your own body. Look at yourself, naked, in a mirror. I know it can be very difficult. I've been avoiding mirrors for years. 
But even if it's harsh on the beggining, it's worth it. At first, you will only see what you dislike in your body. But focus on what your like.
Compliment yourself about what you like in your body.
Then look at the parts that you dislike, and think POSITIVE about it. First, say a compliment about the part you dislike. For exemple,
whenver you think something like "" I hate my boobs they are ridiculously small compared to how big my ass is"" Add something like "" BUT they are also firm, have a nice shape, and I like the colors of my nipples"" Then, try to erase the negative things about it: ""Wow, I'm lucky to have boobs like that - so firm, and what a nice shape !"" even if you don't truly believe it at first.
With time and pratice, your brain will replace negative toughts by positive ones.

If it's really to hard for you to look fully naked in the mirror, start half clothed/half naked. Just undress the top of you body, learn to know and love that part. When you feel ready, do the same for the lower part (and vice versa)

Knowing your body is really important, because not only most of the time you will realize that it's only in your head and that your ass doesn't look bad, but it will really help you to love it with is particularities.  

Too many people treat their body like a total stranger, like ""I don't like you but we're stuck together, so I will ignore you the best I can
to make things easier"" 
You can't love your body without knowing it. Sport is also helping to know it - learn its limits, its strenghts. You'll be surprised.

AND know your body sexually too. Look at your vagina in a mirror. Know it. Don't think it's ugly because of the shape or the color or the hair or anything (their is also a great book about that, can't remember the name but it's something like ""our pussies are beautiful"". It's just pictures of pussies of different women - not in a porn way - all different. Might be kind of weird to look at pussies, but really help you realize that if you don't have a porn star pussy, it is normal because only porn stars have one like that. And it's because they had surgery. True story !)
All that makes you more confident in bed, lead to better sex etc etc. 

- Don't mistreat your body with diets and other things. It will only reenforce the negative thoughts about it. If you arm your body, you will never be able to love it, you will always see it as an ennemy. It is  not. 
Be nice with it : put cream, take care of your skin, go to a sauna... Taking care of your body helps you to know it and love it. It's like positive thinking :
You take care of things you like. If you take care of your body, your brain will slowly understand that it is a sign of love. And you will start to love your body.

- UNDERWEARS. First, Wear underwears that fits you. Find your real bra size - most of women think they know it... But they don't.
So find your real size, and buy a bra that really fits you. You will feel sexy in your underwears, and sexy when you will be dressed, because a well chosen bra can make a real difference on how a top look on you.
Same for panties : take them at your size. If it's too small you will feel uncomfortable. It will cut your blood circulation, making marks on your body and a lot of other uncomfortable stuff.  And I think everybody here has seen someone wearing too small underwears under tight clothes. Yep. Not a good idea. A good underwear is one that support your body - not one compressing it, suffocating it.
Underwears that fits you will flatter your body, and you will feel more positive about it.

Secondly, wear nice underwears. For yourself. Even if no one else than you would see it. You will feel sexier, even fully clothed. It will help
you gain confidence in your body. 

&gt; Obviously, my text is too long, will send the rest in comment !

My entire life I have never felt comfortable with my body, or the way I look, even from an early age. Growing up with a strict Mom of East Asian Heritage, and being the oldest of three girls I was constantly criticized and scrutinized for the way I looked and compared to everyone around me ( skin too dark, hair too short, too fat, etc. ) But also being of mixed race ( My father is Italian / Irish ) I never properly fit into the Asian community, I was ""different"" looking, and looking different is a big deal when everyone is striving hard to blend into what is ""proper"" and ""respectable"" there. When I moved to America, the demographics changed, but the situation didnt change. I didn't fit in with the american / white kids at my school, I moved to a place that was essentially an island. Everyone was white. I was the "" foreign weird kid "" I was taunted, and bullied. I never even had a friend come over to stay at my house until I was almost 12 years old, and did not have a proper friend until about 11 or so. I have vivid memories of the torture at the hand of my bullies, when I was 8 years old I had my two front teeth kicked out by two boys during recess ( obviously my baby teeth ) they had given me a black eye as well. When I was 10 a few girls ganged up on me and shoved me down a flight of concrete steps and I was severely injured, was cut so deep it peeled back the entire flesh of my knee, I remember holding the flesh together and limping to the nurses office alone and having to have an ambulance called for me, and I remember telling my sister that "" They sewed the my knee steak back together "" when she asked why I had stitches in my knee. To this day I have an enormous scar on my knee. Throughout all this I was just silent, and ever cried or cracked in public, I guess it was the way I was raised. My mother demanded any show of weakness / crying / emotion was just my fault for being so emotionally weak. My father was an extreme alcoholic and by the time I was 12 years old fully violent and psychologically / physically abusive. I had been involved in literally every after school activity possible to avoid going home. I was in a really awkward phase of having almost no friends at school, by the ages of 12-13 I had the awkward closet gay kid, and the new girl with the southern accent as my only friends. I got into "" alternative "" lifestyles as I was loathing my culture / parents. I got my first tattoo, I got a few piercings in my face. I was quiet, weird, but did nothing but read classic literature and practiced art and photography. I got sent off to a different high school when I was 14, and we had to part ways with my only friends. ( one who I have reconnected with, now in my 20s ) This high school was for kids who wanted to go for a special diploma. ( Asian mother would have me do nothing Less than As if I ever wanted to not get the piss slapped out of me ) I met a bunch of kids into terrible shit, and started dating one of the boys 2 years ahead of me who had recently just dropped out of the high school completely. I ran away and moved in with him by 15. This was the start of the second most destructive relationship I have ever been in. I was with him for over 6 years. I wont go on too long about it because it's just unnecessary, but he shattered what was left of my self esteem. I stayed because I never though I could do better while I was cheated on, he sat unemployed I was working / going to school / paying for his phone bills/ rent / bought him a car / computer / etc. I was used in EVERY possible way, and at the end of the day berated, never good enough, pretty enough, smart enough. I have long since left and moved on from that relationship, A LONG LONG time ago. That's not the issue here. The issue is my body. ( I guess I just need to rant ) I have been with my soul-mate for the past year now. He is the most amazing, patient, and wonderful man I have ever come to know. He is my best friend, my future husband, my entire world, but most importantly he treats me with respect. I am his equal, and everything we do is together as a team, I have never felt more connected and bonded to a person in my whole life. We are getting married in one months time. He has helped me heal all my emotional wounds. I have a great relationship with my mother now, my father and her are long since divorced, and he has a new wife and son ( which I will never meet unfortunately ) last I heard they were living in South Africa after moving from Spain. Anyways, after all this healing and fixing this is the last thing I guess I have never overcome. Is my body image, I never considered it important until now, realizing as my wedding day approaches how much I cannot stand the sight of myself. I sat down the other night in an attempt of writing, in a therapeutic way. I wrote down all the things I hate about myself.
Hair - I hate everything about it. Its ugly, flat, awkward, cut poorly. I hate the length, the color, my bangs are hideous. It gets greasy quickly, the texture is ugly and I feel like I am losing hair, and that it’s thin. Has no volume or style and it looks dead. I can see my scalp alot.
Face - I hate the shape of my face. From thr front it is round like a moon, but my profile is the absolute worst, and I cant bear to look at it. I have a very flat profile, almost like a pan. My jawline is atrocious, I have an overly small chin, double chin and turkey neck fat. I have a bulbous overly round nose that reminds me of a clown nose. I have disgusting acne prone oily skin that feels constantly greasy and bumpy and even tons of makeup cant hide it. It is red and irritated and scarred and disgusting. My eyebrows are sparse and grow weirdly. I have almost no eyelashes. I grow a mustache. My smile is horrifyingly disfigured. I hate to smile. I hate it I hate it I hate it. My teeth arr extremely crooked and misshapen, I dont take photos while smiling. I am my most ugly when I am smiling, and the most uncomfortable. I will never be happy to smile. I hate smiling. I have no photos of me smiling.
Body - I have a very short and fat neck like a stump. I have fat shoulders and poor posture so I have a large humpback. I have very fat upper arms and there are stretchmarks. I have very fat ugly boyish fingers, and my nails grow awkwardly. I have no collarbones on my chest because i am fat. I have ugly, saggy breasts that have an very ugly shape and are not perky enough. They are covered in Ugly stretchmarks and I have large ugly nipples. My breasts are veiny and look very ugly. I have a short torso. I have no hips or shape to my waist, and a barreled ribcage so i look disfigured. I have absolutely no waist whatsoever, and an enourmous huge gigantic gut covered in stretchmarks that makes me look like i am pregnant and it is just a huge ugly fat flab that hangs over my pants. You cannot see hip bones because i have such a fat stomach. I have love handles that are set too high on my body so it is like a saddle bag and i look disfigured. I am so fat when i bend it makes a huge roll on my sides. I have a huge belly button from all the fat in my swollen nasty gut. I have a weird back because i am hunched. I have a flabby cellulite jiggly pancake butt. It is small flat and ugly. My butt crack is always hanging out because i have no butt to fill into my jeans. I have a fat vagina that is an ugly brown color. I have fat cellulite thighs that touch together. I have stretchmarks. I have short stumpy ugly legs and big calves. I have ugly dry feet. And short dtumpy fat arms. My skin is an ugly color, and i have weird tan patterns.
I re-read this and realized there is actually not a single part about my body I even find remotely attractive, yet I am very comfortable with WHO I am, I just can't seem to grasp what I look like. Inside I am intelligent, understanding, compassionate, open minded, and strong. But outside I feel like I look like something out of a horror film. It gives me anxiety to think about the way I look when I will be standing there with the man I love exchanging vows on my wedding day. I can't even think about having photos taken, and how sad he must feel when I explained to him I cannot smile in our wedding photos. At the same time I feel like these are such silly / stupid things to feel upset over, yet I still feel upset over them anyways. And my lovely man, he tells me every single day several times a day he thinks I am lovely, gorgeous, beautiful, etc. He has even tried sitting in front of a mirror with me and just explaining all the bits of my face that he loves, but I started to feel really anxious and shy and I couldn't sit there and bear to look at myself. In fact, I tend to avoid mirrors, and I try not to fix myself up when I can help it because I go to put on eyeliner and before I know it I have spent 2-3 hours in front of the mirrors trying to hide all the disfigurements I find in my face. I need to stop this, it is taking such a toll on me sometimes, and especially with the most important day of my life, I want to love myself and be a confident bride. I just don't even know where to begin in all of this. I hate how I look so much to the point where it has made me cry. I have nothing positive about my body or physical looks whatsoever. It is defeating at times. I want to love myself and I have been trying to for years, but It seems like I just cant conquer this.",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_r1ixf,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/r1ixf/i_hate_my_own_body_and_i_want_a_change/,

I'm a female who's always been a pretty ""normal"" weight, a bit chubby but always in the healthy BMI range since my teenage years. It shouldn't matter what size I am, but since I was a toddler my mum was always been concerned about my weight. She still is, always remarking how I've ""gained weight"" or how I look like a sausage in my clothes, or how massive my arse is, things like that. Friends in school jokingly called me ""snowball hips"" but the abuse I got/get from my mother (yes, I view it as that) is what upsets me. I developed bulimia a few years ago and I am fighting a constant battle with it, it's not the behaviour but the ill thoughts that are problematic to me right now.


So I was gaining weight and slowly creeping up to the ""overweight"" scale and I can't actually afford new clothes so I thought damnit, let's cut out the crap and eat healthily. Working okay, I'm not gaining anymore. But the thoughts are crippling me sometimes and I don't want to go outside without a big bag over my head on days like these... I'm feeling like a whale, taking over everyone's space, repulsing them, making them feel ill when they see me. When I look at, and feel my belly, I feel horrible and want to cry. This sets me off thinking I need to binge, and I spiral further into my depression.

I know this is not an eating disorder forum, but how do you guys manage to say ""fuck the world, I'm beautiful as I am, this is me, deal with it""?

So when I was playing around with my laptop's camera today I had a real-life epiphany. It was mindblowing and oh so mundane.

[This is the first photo I took.](http://imgur.com/Pwta2GH) My thoughts: ""Oh god my arm is SO flabby.""

[Then I took a second one.](http://imgur.com/0BSxrxU) My thoughts: ""Wait. Hold on. What just happened to my arm? Where did all the flabbiness go? Have I suddenly become a transformer?""

[After the third one I was pissed at myself for being so stupid.](http://imgur.com/tMBTssE) My thoughts: ""Man that gal there looks tiny.""


I took some more and I look different in every single one. Moving my arm half an inch made me visually lose five pounds. Trying different poses made me look like a different person. I finally really got it: I may look flabby in one picture, tiny in another, really heavy in a third, in a fourth photo I might look like a crustacean from the paleolithic era - but this is not what I **am**. The way I look posing or not posing, squishy or skinny, doesn't say anything about my body and its true nature.


I can finally look at those stupid horrible pictures of myself and say: This is not me and this is not my body, this is just the way the light hit the technical electronicalithingamajigs inside the camera the moment someone pressed a button. I don't trust that stuff anymore and I don't think anyone should.

My dad committed suicide when I was 13 years old. I've dealt with some other things in my life as well, but this is the most prevalent. The past year, I've been dealing with an eating disorder and depression, though now I'm in recovery from the ED. Recently, these past couple of months have been a lot better. I've been eating well, exercising regularly, and my depression has not been so bad. However, I can't stand to look at myself. It's not my face I mind; it's my body. I can manage well by not really looking in the mirror all that much. When I don't look in the mirror, I forget what I hate about myself and I feel better about everything else.

I used to have a compulsion to look in the mirror all the time, though it's gotten better. But sometimes, I still feel it. This has been what's going on in the past couple of days especially. Nothing else has really been going on with my life. I'm going to college in a few months, I'll be graduating high school soon. I'm a little stressed out with school, but it's nothing I can't handle. Literally, the thing I hate most about my life is my body. Now, I've always been insecure, and my body hatred has gotten worse with my ED. Apparently, I had a warped view of myself because even at my lowest weight, I still saw myself as looking fairly normal. Honestly, at my lowest weight was the only time I sort of liked how I looked. So, now, at about 15-20ish pounds heavier, I hate myself again.

To get specific, I'm very short. Around 5', if not a little less, short. So, already, I get people commenting on that. To get very specific, the part I hate most about myself is my thighs, and my hips. I feel like they look like these huge, monstrous tree trunks that do not fit with the rest of my body. I'm a runner, so when I look at myself and see this, it does not at all fit with what I think I *should* look like, which I know is an asinine thought in the first place, but that's where my brain goes.

I don't know what to do when I start obsessing over this. Seriously, just looking in the mirror is a catalyst to falling back into a depressive episode. I just feel this compulsion to stare at myself and hate myself and wish that I looked differently.

Sometimes, I look in the mirror and I think I look fine. I think, well, I don't love how I look, but I can live with it. But other times, I can't stand it. I think I look absolutely terrible, and I think, how could that be me? 

My therapist told me that, once I recovered, my warped body image would go away. Maybe it has, but I hope that it hasn't, because I desperately hope that what I see in the mirror isn't actually what I look like.

I don't know what to do with myself. I don't know how to get by because, if I don't like how I look, then how could anyone else? This is all I think about sometimes, about how much I can't stand my body. I eat healthy and run pretty much everyday, but I feel like my body does not look as it should with all of my effort. I feel like this is a huge detriment to my life. I know that being thin isn't everything there is, but I just desperately want to like how I look. I don't know if my view of my body is warped or what, and I'm hoping maybe someone else here suffers from the same thing. I don't want to relapse, but I also don't want to just hate everything about myself and live with it.

I'm in my mid 20s and all my life I've battled against obesity. I can proudly say I'm just a bit chubby and no longer obese. I have lost nearly 100 lbs in under a year.

Unfortunately the trauma from never being ""hot"" has taken a toll on my mental health. I find myself trying my best to say that I am lovely and these huge hips are sexy. But in the end, I hate my body.

I'm bitter because I've never had the hot teen girl body. I've never known what it's like to have perky breasts. My breasts are weird and malformed. The nipple sits at an odd angle and even worse when I'm laying on my side. The fat shifts and sags down to my side. A weird visual as it's difficult to describe in words but I don't think I'm brave enough to post a pic to really let you know how weird and ugly my breasts are. 

I'd really love to say that I did this to myself, as in being fat. But I never really ate junk food, only drank water, my mother would feed me all organic foods and vegetables. I always ate healthy. She'd sign me up for activities such as dancing and martial arts but my weight just grew out of control. Doctors tested for any imbalances but there was no answer. I feel like I'd be less hateful if I had done this to myself, like sat on my ass all day and ate junk...

I don't know what to do. I've successfully lost weight, my face is mildly attractive, but my body is just a mess. Riddled with stretch marks and flaws, oddly shaped wide body for being short. My breasts are my biggest insecurity and my huge huge huge hips make me want to scream in anger.

Why me? I feel like I was punished for something I did in my past life (If I believed in that sort of crap that is). I try every day to tell myself I'm beautiful. I look at myself in the mirror naked and force a smile and I try so hard to accept and embrace myself, but in the end, I really hate every thing about me. 

I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR Hate my saggy weird shaped breasts and huge hips. Recently lost a ton of weight, still scarred mentally from being picked on and neglected for being obese. 

Also side note, do all boobs sag to the side? It's like I'm missing muscle tissue or something on my sides, when I see pictures of other naked women their breasts keep a round shape, mine flatten out like it's a sag of flour.

I have a body acceptance problem. My problem is that I went on a diet. After being the overweight son, the pudgy smart kid in the classroom, and in general someone who enjoyed food, I've become thin. Sometimes I feel like I look pretty good. I have decent muscular definition. I have an ""ideal"" BMI. I can fit into a pair of size 28 jeans and fill a small-sized t shirt.

But I have no conception of how to be comfortable with my body. Everything about being thin to me is a matter of working to be thinner. I haven't been able to get used to being thin without cutting calories and counting them meticulously. I guess what I'm saying is that I have no conception of what living at this size is like. I certainly don't think living like this is sustainable.

So I looked for advice from other sources - fitness websites, fasting, but it seems like people suffer the opposite problem. Either they want to be thinner or they want to be stronger.

I want to know how to continue to look like this. I've seen people about these issues and they aren't helpful because, I feel, they don't understand. They're comfortable with themselves. It's not a big deal for them that they might eat too much once or twice a week because they seem to shrug it off. So any advice they give is second-hand, learned advice.

    My body that can twist and lift and dance
    That skates and paddles and runs quaffles down the pitch
    My body that has the possibility of new life buried inside it

    My beauty is endless
    Limitless
    Stretching from the tips of my too-skinny fingers
    To the stars.

'GODDAMMIT, IT'S NOT ABOUT MOTIVATION!!!! 
Sorry, let me rephrase that. Either you want to lose weight badly enough to put forth effort, time, resources, energy, and intelligence on a regular basis each week to achieve that goal, or you don't. 
It's that simple. 
If you want it, you do it, regardless of your motivation, the same way you do the dishes / brush your teeth / commute to work / etc. without spending a lot of time looking for motivation. 
**If you don't want it, there's /r/bodyacceptance, where you can learn to *pretend* to love being fat.**
Read the FAQs at /r/fitness and here for some good tips if you want to get started. 
The first thing you need to learn is that there's no such thing as ""spot reduction."" You lose fat from all over. 
Good luck!

Ever since I can remember, I've had body issues because of my weight and my looks. I was made fun of constantly growing up and I believed the kids (and adults) were right. I am ugly and ""fat"". I'm currently a US size 6 and I KNOW it's not fat, but unfortunately, you're either ""thin"" or ""fat"". 

No in betweens. 

Anyways. I recently started liking my body and started wearing shorts and dresses for the first time and actually feeling good about it.

Until I got home from college.

During Mother's Day, my Father (who I rarely see) came to visit and I was unpacking my stuff from my luggage in my living room. We made small talk and then he said, ""Do you eat pork?"" I said ""No. Not really. Why? You're calling me fat?"" He always brought up pork when he talks about weight. He replied, ""Yes. You look like it."" 

I. Was. Pissed.

I told him, ""I barely sleep and I eat shit in college. Something is bound to happen."" I wanted to cry so bad, so I went back to my luggage. He asked me, ""Do you exercise?"" I said, ""I rock climb, but I've been too busy recently. I go to the gym when I can."" He asked, ""Are you sure?""

I really wish this didn't upset me as much as it did, but it does. It brought up the constant comments of ""You shouldn't wear that"",""Why are you here? You're ugly"",""You need to work out more"", etc. What I hate even more is that I have to get my confidence back up AGAIN. I know I'm not the thinnest of goddess-looking, but I was actually happy and enjoyed wearing awesome clothes. Now I just keep thinking ""He's a product of this society, so he must know what looks good."" and it's killing me inside.

I've been trying to like myself, but it is quite difficult, especially when your favorite website tells you you should just drown yourself because you're the scum of the universe. 

See, I'm fat.  Almost every reddit post on /r/all feels like its fat bashing or telling me that I need to be skinny to be attractive. I've even asked in some of these threads if a girl would be date-able if she had a great personality, and a cute face, but was sort of fat. The answer was overwhelmingly no, and the general consensus was that once a fat person, you'll always be fat. 

I'm working so hard to lose weight right now. When I first started, I was doing it because my entire family has diabetes and is terribly unhealthy, and I just wanted to beat the disease. Then I was introduced to Reddit, and all that changed pretty quickly. Now I feel like I need to lose weight to be accepted and liked.

Its especially scary for me since this school is all the way across the country for me, I can't just go back home like some other students.

It's a small school, about 600 total.  But these girls... I go to school and every day I watch them walk around and they have these beautiful manes of hair and they're all on diets and they pride themselves so much on being a size 2 or less (juniors).  I have several friends whose mothers are paying them in some form to reach a size 0 by the end of senior year.  And the girls are doing it, and I honestly think I might be sick because of how disgusting I find that.  These girls, to give you a reference, are 16+ and, at the very least, extremely fit, if not beautifully proportioned (that's awkward phrasing, but these girls are all so pretty, physically).  
I just don't know how to deal with this.  I know it's just sizes, but I'm an 11.  I'm not in-shape or fit, but my weight is evenly distributed, and I'm okay with how I look.  I enjoy being able to wear women's clothing, since I prefer some of those styles anyway.  I have short hair, and I love it! It's such a confidence-booster... but it also stands in the way, since most people there now assume I'm gay (not true, and certainly not an insult in any way, but making friends isn't any easier... they're not always accepting people).
But I just can't feel comfortable whenever I'm around these girls, and, to an extent, the guys, because they're so trained to think one thing is beautiful and therefore *that* is the definition of beauty and anything else is weird.  The same reasoning for the girls.
And I have friends, and I like how I look, for the most part, like I said. But how do I deal with this?

1337284281.0,19,self.BodyAcceptance,ts4no,"Recently told I have a disability. I now have an explaination for all the weird things about my body, but I'm starting to resent those things. Would really apprciate help and guidance. ",BrightForcast,19,0,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/ts4no/recently_told_i_have_a_disability_i_now_have_an/,"Hi everyone this is my first ever post on Reddit and I’ve looked at all the guidelines, but if I’ve done anything wrong please feel free to tell me. 

Last year my dad got really ill, he nearly died. After he got out of hospital he was diagnosed with an inherited genetic syndrome (our Doctor thinks it’s a form of [Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002439/, but they’re still working out which one). As far as our Doctor can tell us, this syndrome was the cause of his sudden illness. There is a bit of uncertainty because genetic testing for such syndromes takes ages and he was taken ill very rapidly, so details of exact causes of his illness are still coming to light. People in his family have always died young, and they think it was this undiagnosed syndrome that caused those sudden deaths. He’s still recovering, and has had multiple surgeries to make him better again. 

Where I come in is that it’s a genetically inherited syndrome, and so anything my Dad has I have as well. I found this out about a week before I turned twenty; it was a shock as we thought it was a male-only thing until my physiotherapist pointed out that I have pretty much all of the symptoms for EDS. I had not known anything was ‘different’ about me, my brother shows these symptoms far more obviously. I had to give up boxing, MMA and yoga immediately with my physio stating that she was shocked I hadn’t done myself serious injury. The doctor confirmed this about two weeks later. 

My problem is that though I now have both an explanation for everything I had thought a bit odd about myself (but had always just shrugged off); as well as an early warning system for possible heart and other organ failures, I am now starting to resent my body a little. 
I can’t do things that I used to love doing; I have to be careful around activities that I thought I was fine doing. I don’t feel like my body belongs to me, rather that it belongs to the EDS. I know that sounds a little dramatic, but I can’t help feeling this way. 

What can I do to accept this? How do I move forward and stop being scared of doing things like exercise? I know my disability isn’t as bad as other people’s, but I’m having a hard time accepting it. I think if I were younger it would be easier. Sorry if this has been a bit all over the place, I’ve kept quiet about my feeling around my family because they have enough to deal with without me adding to their stress; and I don’t feel like I can talk to them at this point. 

TL:DR; Diagnosed with a muscle, skin and organ effecting disability at age 20 after traumatic year. Finding it hard to accept and move past. Am scared of doing things that could hurt me. Any help or advise would be really appreciated.

1372372602.0,15,self.BodyAcceptance,1h7kcp,Posted this in /r/depression without much response. Any help/advice/kindness would be truly appreciated! (Potential trigger warning?),,21,6,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1h7kcp/posted_this_in_rdepression_without_much_response/,"I feel this would be a good place to post this, as most of my issues I feel stem one way or another from the way I and seemingly other people feel about my face.

So I'm 26, and I honestly feel like at least 95% of men my age that live in my area (or most places that fortunate enough to be considered developed) are just simply superior to myself. I've had two goals for the past year and a half: to become a better overall me, and to become attractive to the opposite sex. I suppose I completed the first goal with flying colors, though to me it seems meaningless nowadays. I dropped almost all my excess weight (I was near obese at 265) and then gained weight back in muscle. I'm now in the best shape of my life. I've picked up new hobbies that I enjoy (when not in my head), and do volunteer work every weekend. I've worked incredibly hard on my social skills, learning correct posture, the advantages of maintaining eye contact, and making sure I smile at people. I've put a shit ton of work also into my wardrobe and style, making sure I always leave the house looking my best, wearing fitted clothes, and getting higher-end hair cuts from salons. I even got my college degree and have interviews lined up for much better jobs. I also always try to force myself to go out and meet people, as I know I'll get nowhere if I do not.

Yes I might be a much better person overall than I was before, but it just seems meaningless. Women still are not attracted to me. With this, a deep seeded hatred of myself has formed. I think I'm hideous and have a face that no one could love, and have had the unfortunate experiences of having people tell me the same thing in person (both friends (kindly) and strangers (not so much)). So when I put my pictures on somewhere like /r/amIugly, and they only tell me I'm not too ugly to date, I still feel like they just are focusing my story, and not on my looks due to me not having much. I see other guys put pictures on there and women say stuff like ""would definitely date"", but I never get these kinds of comments.

My apologies for getting kinda off topic with my fixation on looks (though I feel like it's my biggest hindrance), but the point remains I feel inferior both genetically and experience-wise, and it's leading me to the point where I'm slowly thinking that I'm just too far behind and all my work was pointless. I know I should think there is more to life than the opposite sex, but it has slowly flooded my mind to the point it's all I think about, and it has made me miserable to the point of considering suicide (I'm not actively suicidal, so no need for links to /r/suicidewatch). Until I get a full time position with benefits which include coverage for a therapist, therapy isn't an option for me (no one in my area is accepting patents under sliding scale either).

Any advice/thoughts/simple kindness would be appreciated. Thanks so much for reading.

I came home from work one morning (I work graveyard) with a bee in my bonnet to put together this particular card. 

____
[The Card.](http://i.imgur.com/cX0tc.jpg?1)
Journal Entry:
I refuse to change my body in order to improve my body image. My goal over the past year has been to work from the inside out. I am trying to find the true me. I'm trying to find what I want from life, what truly makes me
happy. When I am writing, or crafting, or traveling, or near my family, I do not need to fill my heart with a junk shot of food (healthy or not).

It is not simple laziness that has made me this way. It is a series of events and feelings, emotions, comments, criticisms, even compliments taken the wrong way that have degraded my image of myself. I think only people in my situation understand ""I'm depressed because I'm fat, I'm fat because I'm depressed.""

Every body needs to find its own path in its own time. I am tired of people saying, ""Just do it my way."" It does not work. It worked for you, that's awesome, but I need to find my own way.

This was the second SoulCollage card I ever made. It was powerful. It is my ""Witness Source"" card, which means that it is the card that represents me accepting myself for who I am. When I scattered the flowers around the picture of the body, I burst into tears, because that is what I am struggling to do, accept that my body, flawed as it is, is valid and beautiful. I cannot expect to wait to change my body before I can accept my whole self.

Because what it is, is me.

I've been trained/coached for years.  I've got narrow hips, small boobs, a flat stomach, muscular legs, and very thin/scrawny arms.  The thing is, it's never *enough* for me.  I want narrower hips and a flat chest and a 6-pack instead of a 2-pack and I want my legs to look like [this](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fRX7XlewrNQ/T1fgxOxZoJI/AAAAAAAAEAM/P3Advip6Jhc/s1600/img_rep_6032_1.jpg) instead of like [this](http://i.imgur.com/wbyHx.jpg?1) (those are my legs from ~7 months ago; preseason).  What's worse is that I want my period to stop.  My period is already very short and light without me being on any form of birth control.  Elite female distance runners often don't menstruate, nor do they tend to look typically ""feminine"" ([Fionnuala Britton](http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Fionnuala+Britton+13th+IAAF+World+Athletics+88rCFchhUBhl.jpg) has my dream body).  All these years of training and competing have made me connect menstruation and femininity to weakness and — more importantly — slowness.

Finally a few days ago it clicked for me: all of my body ideals are traits of male runners.  I don't in any way want to *be* male.  I'm sexually attracted to men, and I really like being a girl; I wouldn't want to change that for anything in the world.  I have no idea how to explain it.  Is there a word for this?  It's incredibly confusing to me, and I know it's unhealthy, but running is what keeps me sane.  I took a few months off running and the only thing that came from it was 2 months of mild bulimia (it was about control much more than it was about body image).  I *can't* stop running.  Not after I've dedicated so many years to this.  It's the thing I love to do most in the whole entire world.  And I love competing.

I work out moderately, but it's hard to see. I'm a bit on the skinny side, but I have some fat on my stomach and butt. Objectively, I feel pretty average looks-wise. Emotionally, I feel like the runt of the genetic abomination litter. I am not tall. I do not have straight hair. I do not build muscle easily. I do not have an above-average penis. I sometimes have hair in weird places. I only recently lost my virginity. About the only thing I'm ok with is not being white. (You can find me in a crowd easier!) I feel society tells me I'm not sexy, since I am not /r/LadyBoners material. I can't put on a dress and makeup and feel beautiful. My sexuality is a mixture of creepiness and perversion, a threat to women everywhere.

Compliments are probably just simple flattery. They never come out of the blue. I deflect them off me like like arrows against armor. You tell me I'm hot, I'm wondering what you want from me. If I'm told I'm smart, well maybe you need to raise your bar a little higher. One of my platonic friends keeps telling me I'm attractive. I wish I could take her seriously, but I just can't. It always feels like a platitude.

Dating is terrible for my self-esteem. Talk to ten girls, 6 have boyfriends. 3 of the rest aren't interested, and the last just wants to keep things simple and stay single. I don't blame them at all. But try it a few dozen times, without ever getting approached yourself in kind. You feel like the scum of the earth, the most undesirable thing that can possibly exist. If a girl talks to me she's just being friendly. ""Signals"" are worthless, one girl's flirtatiousness is another girl being friendly. I've just learned to try and get shot down anyway. At least after a few dozen rejections it only stings slightly. 

Occasionally there is some success:

* ""You're cute! [if I share a picture online]"": Yeah, it's a photo. Anyone can look like a 10 in a photo, honey.
* ""Your profile, it made me laugh so much!"": Being funny is pretty much my only sexy trait. If I can't make ONE person laugh on this planet of billions, well then I'm just a complete failure.

When I encounter the rare occurance of having sex with a girl, it's like they're doing me a favor, having sex with a guy. Guys are ugly, unless they're Joseph-Gordon Levitt.

* ""You have a nice cock"": You're just trying to boost my ego because you're having sex with me. You would say that to any guy you were having sex with.
* ""Holy crap, you have back muscles! That's so sexy!"": I'm the first guy to give you a proper orgasm, you're just saying that in gratitude or something.

Did I mention I'm really tired of masculinity being tied to sex or being in a relationship? Not all of us are in that beautiful upper echelon.

I may as well not exist. I have to constantly iniate social encounters. I'm pretty social when I go out. But if I go to a party, and don't initiate conversation, the CIA should probably hire me since I'm Solid Snake. (Also my skin color helps ;) Getting approached is rare. Maybe I'm vain, but I think I desire some validation of existance. I feel like being sexualized or objectified would at least grant me that. But who would do that? I'm just a guy. A creeper and a pervert by default. Who wants me?

Rant, kind of.",hotforhautbois,21,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/10bwub/stigmas_and_what_do_i_even_call_me_rant_kind_of/,"Alright, so I don't frequent this sub. I'm probably not familiar enough, so if I violate any community stuff, please do not hesitate to say so. I know accepting one's self is difficult and utterly personal.

So I seem to be part of a demographic; its not ""skinny"", and its not ""curvy"". But somewhere in between. And this demographic seems to attract a lot of hate.

For example. I've seen comments shaming the idea of being happy to be 115 lbs, or happy to have a small measurement of some kind. Happy, as in comfortable. Not gloating. 

Why, I'd ask these people. 

""Well that's just not a healthy weight"" 

""You'd have to be starving yourself to do that""

How the fuck can you know that? Honestly, acting like you understand someone's biological make up.

Anecdote. In high school, I was at the doctor a lot because I was frequently tired and unmotivated. In the end, it turned out to be a combination of pacific northwest gloomyness (Seasonal Affective Disorder; its a thing), and anemia. Blood disorders run in my dad's side. This was fixed by moving to California and low-dose iron pills. I didn't do anything besides that.

But for the longest time, it was assumed by everyone that I had an ED, or that my problems were caused by my weight. Everybody joked about me being anorexic or bulimic. Luckily I didn't succumb to the bullying; I'm pretty stubborn. But when people figured out I didn't have an ED, I got shit for ""making all other women feel bad"", because I look the way I do (I have an hourglass shape but I'm very small) and I eat utter crap. This saddens me, because I've always thought that all women are beautifully themselves. I'd never try to make others feel bad about their bodies.

Relatives would tell me I need to eat because I ""haven't grown into a woman yet"". 

I'm sorry, what? 

I *know* I'm a woman. I think I figured it out when I got my period. 

That is just ridiculous. If you identify as such, its part of you. end of story.

Anyway. I don't even know what to call myself. I'm not skinny, my limbs aren't lanky like that. I'm not the general definition of curvy, because I'm small in the sizes, but I have that same body type. I have the ""waist is too skinny"" as well as the ""boobs/hips are too big"" problems with clothing. Fuck clothing meant for the non-shapey.

I guess having a word for my body type isn't too concerning. I'm just me, I guess. But this ignorance really brings me down from time to time. I know we all suffer from that commonality, that is, an uninformed society, no matter what we look like.

I posted this in r/offmychest on a throwaway account, and decided to put it here, in hopes of getting some advice as to how to overcome this. I added some things and edited it for trigger words.

It's a daily ritual: I wake up, look in the mirror, and pick apart my body, mentally dissect it until it's nothing more than pounds of deconstructed flesh. I survey each part with a critical eye, deem it unworthy, and move on to the next. For each part, I cry, mourning my genetics and my frame.

I start with my face. It's okay, I guess. If you're into girls with dark hair, big noses, and a smile that makes her look 12 instead of 20.

I move downward. My shoulders, broad for my 5'0 frame. My chest, practically nonexistent. 34 As that look like fleshy mosquito bites. I think back to times when guys have wanted to take my shirt off, the shame I felt when I knew they'd be seeing my breasts. The disappointment I saw on their faces when they looked at me.

My stomach. Skinnyfat.  All my weight goes here. Sometimes I feel like my stomach is the core of negativity, pumping out negative messages to the rest of my mind and body.

My hips and ass are no better. Tiny, boxy, unfeminine to the t. No amount of jeans or stretchy yoga pants can make them look curvy and ""womanly.""

Every day, I look in the mirror and cry. This body is supposed to be my temple. Instead, I've turned it into a weapon of self-destruction.

Sometimes I feel like no one will ever love me because of this body. Though I'm technically considered thin, and therefore subject to forms of ""thin privilege,"" I still feel inadequate, like less of a human being, because I don't have that ""womanly"" shape or conventional attractive face prized by the rest of society.

When it comes to men, I feel like a consolation prize, only wanted when someone prettier or curvier is unavailable. One instance that comes to mind is my last relationship: I dated my ex for nearly a year, and was in love with him. We clicked mentally, but when the clothes came off, he wanted nothing to do with me, and rejected my attempts at sex many times. He said it was because he was nervous, and had performance issues. But then we broke up, and days later, he slept with another girl, who was gorgeous and had a perfect hourglass figure. I'm convinced it was my looks and lack of curves that pushed him away. I would love to date again, but I'm afraid that no one will want me because I'm too short, or my body is too masculine-looking.

I'm tired of perpetuating this stereotype of ""girl with body issues."" I honestly just want to feel normal. But I feel like I can't feel normal without my body changing as well.

Every time, and I mean EVERY time I find something I finally start to grow on, it changes. For example, I used to like my eyebrows. I didn't change anything, I just started to like them. A few days later, my cystic acne starting invading my brows and even causing some brow loss. I decided I actually liked my lips. And a few days later, they randomly started becoming extremely chapped, both unsightly and very painful. I one day came to like my booty, so tried to be more active so I can make my legs nice to match. Destroyed my ass and made it a squarish, dimply pancake thing.     
Anyway, it happened again today. My feet were probably the only thing left I kind of felt okay about. Finding shoes that fit was always hard because they were slightly different sizes and much wider than average feet. But I thought that my bare feet actually looked kind of cute. And I started to like them. Today, I was filling up a water bottle. As I waited for the bottle to fill, I looked down at the ground and my eyes caught my feet. Suddenly, the feet that I once thought were somewhat pleasant now looked like the most hideous, disgusting little feet ever. It was as if they suddenly became stubbier and less human-like. I looked back up, walked to my room, sat on the edge of my bed, and looked at my feet again. They still looked ugly. I cried. I don't know why I feel this way. Maybe I'm just so used to every nice aspect of my body being taken away from me that I couldn't stand being satisfied. My depression just wouldn't allow it for any longer.

Here's a little backstory: I'm 18 years old, soon to be 19, and I'll be going away to college next month. Now, that means a lot of buying new things and needing to pick out what I need to bring and what I won't need. This includes buying new clothes, of course. However, I also struggled with an eating disorder through the past couple of years, and while I consider myself recovered, I still do struggle with negative thoughts sometimes.

I am in a much better place now than I was a year ago. I am an avid runner, I do strength exercises, and I am a vegan. These things help me feel good about myself, and I think that knowing that I need to eat enough so that I can be a strong runner helped me a lot. I've also been seeing a therapist, though I will not be seeing her once I go to college.

I used to be about twenty pounds heavier than I am now, when I was in my earlier teenage years. When I was in the depths of my eating disorder, I was about fifteen pounds lighter than I am now, and now I am at a healthy weight. But I am afraid of gaining weight again. I used to feel uncomfortable in my own skin when I was heavier, which I am sure fueled my ED (along with other, personal issues), so I mostly stuck to wearing baggier clothes. Now, I am still the same way, though I have been gaining more confidence in the way I look, and I credit my running for that. I want to start dressing nicer in college, which would mean having to go out and buy new clothes to wear. But I'm terrified of buying these new clothes, and then finding out a couple months later that I am growing out of them in college because I am gaining weight.

When I was at that higher weight, my lifestyle was much different; I was only exercising once or twice at week at most (horseback riding), and I didn't care about what I ate. I was a typical teenager. Now, I am much more conscientious. As soon as I started running, I began losing weight, but then, before I ever leveled out, I spiraled downward into an ED, and then I had to crawl out of that hole that I'd dug for myself. I consider my life now to be much healthier than it ever was in the past.

I guess I am nervous about this because college is a new environment. I will not be eating the same foods I do now, I will not be living the same way I do now. But I will be walking a lot more (big city campus), I will be sticking to my vegan diet, and I will be joining my school's club cross-country team, so I will still be running. I know that I can't just gain twenty pounds in a night, but I am afraid of it sneaking up on me. I was just so uncomfortable with myself when I was at that high weight, so I don't know how to quell my fears about this now. I was wondering if anyone here has any advice for me.

I've been overweight all my life coupled with horrible acne that started when I was 10.  I've never been conventionally attractive.  While it's something that used to bother me as a teen as I'd enviously dream of being more like my older, stunning sister, I learned to embrace it when i got out of high school and realised I don't actually enjoy attention from others but prefer people to judge me based on wit and intellect rather than appearance.  

Due to stressful living arrangements two years ago, I went through a tough time and lost well over 60lbs over a very short period of time. That brought me down to approximately 100lbs which is appropriate for my 5'1"" frame.  I didn't seek to lose that weight, I was comfortable with my appearance.  I truly felt I was beautiful before but the weight-loss has seemingly made me more desirable to others. (I'm basing this purely on interactions)

Unfortunately, that's brought up a slew of negativity.  A few months after the loss I started getting a barrage of catcalls.  That, I can handle.  I couldn't handle the random gropings, the persistence, or that time a chick attacked me at a bar because her boyfriend was looking at me. (man, the stories I could tell...)

As I mentioned earlier, I don't appreciate attention from others.  Especially not attention that is given on the sole basis of physical attraction. I grew up recognizing that looks are not the most important thing about a person so I get intensely resentful of people who approach me based purely on appearance.   

As a result of the new-found attention, I stopped putting effort into my appearance,  I developed a depression and never leave the house unless to go to work.  I just don't want people to look at me.  I don't want to be judged.  I stopped going to the beach, bars and parties. That stuff used to be my livelihood in better days.

I'm tired of this.  I want to accept the body i have.  I don't want to feel ashamed that people are looking at me.  I don't want to feel like people are only talking to me because i may be more pleasing to their eye.  I want to wear the clothes I used to wear, slather my face in the same make-up and act the same way I used to before this happened.  Now when i do that it's assumed I'm TRYING to illicit sexual advances.

tl;dr:  I unintentionally lost weight 2 years ago that has made me the target of unwanted attention.  I developed a depression because I feel like less of a human after being objectified on multiple occasions. (It's quite a shock to someone who has never previously experienced someone have an instant physical desire towards them)

I've already had people tell me I should just be happy but I can't do that until I figure out how to accept my body and accept the attention that I may receive from it.

I just found this subreddit via Google and wanted to seek help with accepting my body.  If the title of this post lead you to think that I'm some female who wishes she was more curvy, then you may be surprised to find out I'm actually a male.  Although I think I have somewhat of an understanding of what such a girl may feel like.

I'm 23 years old, but I could easily pass for a high schooler if I wanted to.  I'm 5""8 and about 130 lbs, my bone frame is extremely small, my face barely grows patchy bits of stubble, and I have a naturally boyish looking face.  My hair is naturally curly too, which has also contributed greatly to my insecure body image over the years as well (I think it makes me look even younger).  My last girlfriend said it made me look like a ""cherub"" -.-  Which she said she liked, but it's still hard for me to accept nonetheless.  I'm insecure about all of these things and I'm insecure that I'm insecure about them.  I feel like it's stuff I shouldn't worry about, but I do.

I just want to look like and feel like a man.  I tried for years to change myself, by stuffing my face with food, working out, straightening my hair etc... but nothing I ever tried was ever effective in making me look more masculine/older (except for using a hair straightener, obviously, but that is such a hassle &amp; damages hair with excessive use).

I feel like I want to approach this from a new angle.  Rather than trying so hard to change myself, I just want to learn to accept myself for who I am.  If I had posted this even a few days ago, I probably would have been seeking tips for weight gain, obtaining steroids, or whatever :P  But I want to learn to accept myself.

Does anyone have any advice for how to learn to love my body?  I just haven't found much of anything about this from a male's perspective.  Any advice, from anyone, is much appreciated.

(Might trigger ED/SI people)",sbwv09,25,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/15617p/recovering_bulimic_220lbs_56_hating_my_body_in/,"Sorry, this will be long. 

Just found this community.. seem like a great group of ladies and gents who might be able to help me. I'm 26 years old. I've struggled with my weight as long as I can remember. My mother and sisters are the same. My mother told me to go on a diet when I was in kindergarten. I was constantly teased for being fat. In middle school, my mom started to focus on the fact that I would never get a boyfriend or husband if I didn't lose weight. I developed self injury issues (cutting) in high school. When I moved out of my parents' house, the new-found freedom of not being criticized over every bite I ate was too much. I also worked at the dining hall of my college and was under a lot of academic pressure... at my highest weight, I was 325lbs. At this point, I decided to have weight loss surgery. I got the Lap-Band in 2007. At my lowest weight, I was 200lbs, which was a 125lb loss. I lost 10 dress sizes.

The secret that nobody knew was that I was also bulimic. I was bulimic before the surgery. I used laxatives. After the surgery, it was easy enough to induce vomiting as well. Vomiting is common in lap band patients so I didn't have to do much to help it along (sorry if that's tmi). In any case, I didn't really care. I was getting results and looking and feeling great... and then the weight loss stopped. I mean, I knew it would eventually, but it was disappointing. It's sort of how weight loss surgery works.. you have your big loss but you have to maintain it yourself after those first couple of years. 

In any case... I had a boyfriend (who became my husband, now my ex husband). He talked out of both sides of his mouth. I was 'cute' (never beautiful). He thought I was sexy (but we almost never had sex), etc. I left my home country and a good job to be with him and take a low paying job doing something I hated. The weight came back and I was at 230 for a time. He pointed out my weight gain a lot... I managed to lose down to about 205. As we grew apart and I finally got the strength to leave him, my weight went up and down. I've been at 220 for awhile now. My mother still comments on my weight and eating habits constantly. It hurts me very much.

In order to start over, I took a job teaching overseas. That's how I met my amazing boyfriend of 6 months. It was love at first sight. He is my prince. He adores my body. He really believes that my body is the ideal body for a woman. He tells me all the time how beautiful I am and points out specific things he loves about my body and how I look (and also lovely things about the person I am!). He wants to sketch and draw my body... he says I'm a work of art. He makes me very happy.. but it is so hard for me to believe him. I still feel huge and disgusting. Every day I eat any junk food or go over 1300 calories, I feel like a worthless pig. I do all kinds of hateful self talk.. and I have the strongest, strongest urges to start purging again (I stopped right before I left to teach overseas). I don't want to do that. I don't want to hurt myself anymore.

I don't want to be like this. I am making healthy changes just to feel better (more fruits and veggies, etc). I don't own a scale (I used to weigh myself over 10 times a day.. I just weigh at the doctor's office now) and I try not to count calories (I usually still do...). I just.. want to be happy. I want to get dressed and go out and not feel disgusting (I live in an Asian country where I am something to stare at, so that probably doesn't help. All foreigners get stared at though, so it isn't my weight, but still..). I want to feel sexy for my boyfriend who loves my body. 

I need help. I need to read a book. I need someone to talk to. 

Thank you for reading. 

tl;dr : Body issues all my life.. lost over 100lbs with weight loss surgery, gained a little back. Feel disgusting all the time even though my boyfriend tells me how much he loves my body. Used to be bulimic.. fighting urges to purge again due to the hatred of my body.

People noticed me and I had my choice of men by my side with very little effort because outside of being attractive physically I was smart, cleaver, funny, accepting, loving, kind and a talented cook and artist. I was an all around good person, a happy healthy person.

Time passed. I became indulgent of physical pleasures. Sex, drugs, food, I was gluttonous for pleasure for enjoyment. I wanted to consume whole my life and burn out fast and beautiful. I danced and drank, I was a good chaotic wild person. 

Time passed, I got old. Old being relative to how young I had been. I settled down. I got married. Then, the man I loved stooped having sex with me. It was me, it was my body I must have been undesirable I said. I got depressed and I ate and I ate and I ate. I gained a lot of weight. Then one night when he didn't come home (I might add he was a drug dealer) I got scared he was not okay, I called him I called all his friends, and finally I tracked him down and he was drunk and he said ""get off my fucking nuts or I'll start treating you like I treat my mom and I only call her on the holidays."" then he hung up on me. I went to the bedroom and I sat there thinking about killing my self. I've never been suicidal except for that one moment, and something in my brain snapped. I knew this was wrong, I was better than this I deserved better. I got up called my friends and asked them to come over with empty trunks. I packed all my things in a few hours and in one large caravan I left. 

Time passed, years. I fell in love with my current partner. He loves me so much and I love him. He looks at me like I'm the most beautiful woman in the world.  And when I'm with him and we are having sex I forget how foul my body is. But when hes not there I look at my self in the mirror and I feel sick, all I see is all the weight I gained in my failed past relationship. Its like there's this physical manifestation of my hate and guilt and sorrow. Sometimes I dream of cutting off the extra weight, like with knives. I'm sure this is not healthy. what is worse Is I'm afraid to really talk to anyone about it. I'm afraid to admit there is a problem. I cut my calories down so low that I'm losing weight pretty fast now... But I feel tired and sad all the time. I know what I'm doing is wrong and I want to stop. Even now, typing this I feel a lot better. Just telling anyone, even you digital strangers. I've not felt like I really belonged in an ED group i'm not thin, im not underweight. I'm still over weight. 

I'll never be thin like I was, I don't think. I need to accept that with a healthy diet and exercise I can be healthy. I need to accept that having curves is not bad. I need to accept that I am still the beautiful, smart, clever, talented person I have always been. I just don't know how to. I'm lost.

I've never posted on this site before, so I hope I do not make any mistakes.
I am female, and am 23 years old.
I used to be anorexic, and after therapy etc. I began to eat 'more normally' and over time put the weight I had lost back on. I feel I have dealt with the issues which caused me to lose weight in the first place, and am generally in a much better place than I was.

My problem is that despite this, I spend large portions of my days looking at myself and hating what I see. I cannot describe the revulsion I feel when I see my body sometimes, and it frightens me. I also have an enormous problem with how I look facially, which is something which has plagued my life even before I started hating my body as a whole. I feel incredibly shallow and ungrateful, because, though I have a few minor health problems, there is nothing seriously wrong with me, and I know I should be thankful that I am a generally healthy person every day of my life. I know this, but for some reason when I catch a sight of myself in the mirror I forget all this and begin to tear myself apart. 

Also I am always looking at other women and comparing myself to them, I actually feel physically ill when I see very thin, attractive women because I know I can never possibly be as beautiful as them. 

I am currently in a relationship with a wonderful guy who constantly tells me how much he likes the way I look, and as much as I appreciate this, I can't help but think he is lying just because he loves me to much to say otherwise. I don't feel attractive enough to be with him, and I really hate myself when I have days where I can't help but say the most horrible things about the way I look in front of him, he really doesn't deserve to hear me be so emotionally abuse to myself (it sounds strange, but this is really how I feel I behave sometimes!)

I don't know what to do really, and was just wondering if anyone else had any success in overcoming these feelings post-eating disorder or otherwise.

A short while ago I asked /r/amIugly if I was ugly. I got a cascade of responses that *if I wore makeup* I *would* be hot.

Excuse me? What, my face isn’t good enough? I have to wear a fake one? 

“But Gashcat, good makeup embellishes your features, not-“

No. Fuck you. Men don’t have to ‘embellish’ anything. Why? Why is that? 

If I’m unattractive, so be it! But don’t you fucking tell me that I am ‘supposed’ to wear makeup. Why is it that men can roll out of bed, pull their fingers through their hair and maybe a razor over their face and call it a day, and women are expected by society to bend over backwards? When did natural fall out of favor? So many girls on AmIUgly are told ""throw on makeup!"" It's like an equivalent to ""Hit the gym.""

I just don't understand it. The whole ""if"" factor just boggles my mind. If my face isn't good enough, fine. Okay. But I don't get the whole makeup thing tilting the scale all the way from ugly to hot. I don't want to be fake. 

And I don't want to be told I *have* to be if I ever want to attract a guy...That part in particular is just depressing and perhaps the most wishful part of this little tirade I have going...

I don't have anything against choosing to wear makeup for fun, I really don't. But I feel like there is some odd standard going on here. I want to be told the truth. Do you get what I'm saying? Being told to ""fix"" my face with makeup is just fucked up.



On a more BA note, no, I'm really not happy with my face. My nose is too large, and not in an interesting, angular way, but in a bulbous squashed kind of way, and I can't put my finger on what is wrong with the bottom half of my face but there just *is* and I feel just awful about my looks. The only thing I like about it is my eyes and my hair but of course everyone tells me just to straighten it... I have tried makeup. To be honest it looked like it didn't belong on my face.

I've never been in a relationship or even kissed a woman, let alone had sex.

The problem is, I think I am more or less good looking, but I have always had a weight problem. When I was 16 and got my first driver's licence, I weighed 245 lbs (at 5'10""). I always had this idea in my head that one day I'd lose a bunch of weight and I'd feel so good about myself and that's when things would get better for me. Well, miraculously, I actually did that. I had gotten up to about 265, and someone bought me a step counter for Christmas, and I actually used it, and I got down to 185 at the lowest. The problem is that I had set my sights on 170 and at that point, it was just really hard to lose any more. I have since gained a significant part of that back and am now roughly 235. I actually am trying to lose some of that back, but I get really frustrated because it didn't really make that much difference in my life, so I have a lot of trouble keeping an exercise/diet regimen going--it just doesn't feel like it's worth it.

In the mean time, as a young person, I never really felt that girls would like me because I was too heavy. I think this was partially because I didn't really feel attracted to overweight women, and as a result, I just couldn't imagine a woman being attracted to me. As I've gotten older, more of my peers have put on weight, yet they all seem to be able to accept themselves as they are and believe that women find them attractive, while I anxiously imagine that they all are happy to be my friends but they don't find my physique appealing. 

So the question I pose to you is: how do you let go of those assumptions and feel attractive for who you are?",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_rcc1n,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/rcc1n/frustrated_virgin_trying_to_accept_myself/,

I feel like trash right now. I'm normally pretty good with accepting my body but recently I've been beating myself up badly about it. I have a Premier League Hockey grand final tomorrow and I feel like I'm going to let my team down. I'm the goalie, so that's how I can play in such a high grade and still be fat. More than that, I'm just so over the shame of it all. I'm over putting a bit on and feeling completely ashamed and hateful toward myself. I made the mistake of jumping on the scales a while ago and the sight wasn't pretty. It was actually a complete shock. Urgh. I just feel worthless. 

As I said I'm usually quite accepting. I personally would like to lose some weight because I'm an active person and I hate that it holds me back, but usually I'm ok. I believe strongly in stopping the self-loathing and being happy in our own bodies. I believe strongly that we shouldn't be defined by society's standard of beauty. I believe strongly that we are more than our bodies. I just find that I can't right now. I hate it :(

Got any spare love? I could use some.

1373230511.0,14,self.BodyAcceptance,1htkkn,My view on advice on how to hide body shape 'flaws'.,Vyae,19,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1htkkn/my_view_on_advice_on_how_to_hide_body_shape_flaws/,"A few days ago, my friend was 'online window shopping' for dresses. She linked me a few she liked, so I gave the site a look too. I linked her some that I thought were pretty, and added that I've always felt awkward in dresses because I feel so exposed in them. She replied with 'Yeah you look awkward in dresses.' Adding that it's because I have no boobs or waist and started giving me suggestions about how I can hide the fact that I have those 'flaws'. 

It didn't bother me at the time, but it really hit me hard today and I feel really offended. It was almost comparable to the anxiety and rage I felt when my mom told me I was fat when I was a teenager at 5'4, 90lbs, and when my aunt constantly told me I had fat legs whenever she came over. After several years of on-and-off cycles of binge eating and starving myself for no reason, edging on anorexia at one point, I am okay with my body. I've found peace with myself through something I love: sport and exercise. I am an athlete, and I have an athlete's body. I am able to run up several flights of stairs without being winded and lift weights equivalent a freaking BEAR. So why do I doubt that I have a beautiful body right now? 

This friend and I have been 'best friends' for close to a decade. She's not a bad friend, and she is very well learned, but she can be very uncouth with her words, especially online. It's like she doesn't know that some of the things she says are really offensive. She has gained a lot of weight and a lot of curves in the last few years. Recently, she started to love her body, and I'm extremely proud of her for that. But she has also begun peck at my lack of breasts whenever there is a chance for her to, and will then proceed to makes sure that my other friend and I know that unlike me, she has jugs of feminine fat on her chest. Why do people do this? I feel extremely insecure about it, but I'm trying to fight it. 

Earlier today, I found myself googling up on ways to get a more defined waist, then kicking suggestions to the side when I realize what I was doing thanks the language used in those articles. ""DON'T wear ____, it will draw more attention to your 'problem area'. Instead, wear ___, to hide it!"" I don't feel like I need to fluff up my almost-flat-chested-ness by wearing ruffles where my boobs should be. I don't need to wear an A-Line or puffy skirt to make it look like I have hips proportional to my broad shoulders. I don't have to avoid 3/4 sleeves or tight tops because that would make me look 'more lanky' and accentuate my lack of a defined waistline. I will wear whatever the hell I want to because I feel good in them, and they will help me perform in competitions. I am not abnormal because I don't have the proportions of everyone else.

With that said, I still don't understand. When was it okay for us to all hate ourselves because of our physical appearance? It seems like there always has to be something wrong with someone's body. There are few people who can look like Emma Watson or any other beautiful celebrity out there, but who's to say that we're not all perfect in our own way? Why should I hide the strong shoulders I worked so hard for, or my fast, powerful legs just because they don't fit in with the general consensus for what is 'beautiful'? I am not going to change myself to look a certain way for society to be okay with looking at me, I will look like however I want to. I will choose my clothes, my clothes don't get to choose me.

Screw the opinions of negative people. I am a real person, and I am okay with the way I look and feel.

I think I was always kinda neutral on it, because I didn't realize what I had when I was thin. But of course now that I'm fat I just want to go back, and my feelings about my own body are almost 100% negative (I guess I'm impressed by my general health and strength and the fact that I can carry so much fat without it impeding my movement).

I'm new here -- never posted, never read. So i'm kinda guessing here, without reading the sidebar (I know, rtfm): one is supposed to love/like/accept one's own body even if one wants to change it? I'm not really sure how this is possible. Is the body acceptance ethos demanding that we not want to change our bodies? That we not have physical ideals that we strive for? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding, and it's possible to hold the views of ""I love my body"" and ""I want to change my body"" at once, even though that seems a little bit like crazy talk.

But I defer to the experts, and re-ask my original question: what does it feel like to actually like your own body? And furthermore, for those of you who have been in a body-state of both more towards the ""media ideal"" and also far away from that ideal (fat, mostly, I guess), is your sense of loving your own body different in these two states?

[Here is the link](http://business.inquirer.net/115945/penis-size-does-matter-to-women-researchers-say#.UWNlBXMAA-M.reddit) 

I read it, and certainly there is reason to say ""thanks Captain Obvious,"" and then I thought... how many times are women criticized for some flaw that they don't really have control over? 

I come from a family of chunky women. Not a one of us is thin. All of us are pretty busty, with flat asses. We don't have thick, fluffy, wavy hair. We are pretty average looking as a group. And as far as I have come with regards to accepting myself for what I am (mom of 4, victim of stretch marks), and being comfortable with myself (and I am)... I come here all the time and upvote, mod or comment on women that are so incredibly hypercritical of themselves because I want you all to know that you are OK, exactly the way that you are.  Be healthy and be happy and love yourselves. 

And when I saw that link, I was unwilling to pass it on anywhere, even though it would generate a generous amount of humorous comments. I was unwilling to post it, because I wouldn't want any guys to feel worse about this kind of thing or more insecure than they already are. This was my very first thought! Well, that and I have certainly lied about it like a rug in past situations and I wouldn't want anyone to think that women were a bunch of liars. 

In this sub, we are constantly being trolled by people from a few areas of reddit dedicated to fitness, or whatever. People that seek to make fun of, or shame people that don't fit into their ideal. And it's a constant battle to keep up with removing comments or banning. 

I wondered what would happen if women started telling the truth about something like this? If hypercritical commentary were suddenly directed at something that they had that was lacking? Women as a group are constantly being compared to an ideal that is often very genetic. We can't all have model perfect bodies, and we beat ourselves up for it. 

I have really spent a lot of my life trying not to hurt other people's feelings and mostly as a result of being bullied for various things. It wouldn't even occur to me to just insult someone for any reason. And as a mom, I got in the habit of trying to build people up and make them feel good about themselves. 

The people that come here to troll, are sick, insecure people that have to insult others just to feel *normal.* They have to hurt others to feel good about themselves and as mad as I get when I go through the mod queue to remove abusive posts, I need to remember that. Maybe just for my own sanity. ",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,1365539714.0,,,True,t3_1bz3hz,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1bz3hz/today_i_came_to_a_startling_realization/,
1365091447.0,14,self.BodyAcceptance,1bo1es,"[TW:BH,ED] I had a major setback and don't know what to do with myself",VeritasEtVenia,20,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1bo1es/twbhed_i_had_a_major_setback_and_dont_know_what/,"I've always struggled with body acceptance and have used lots of unhealthy coping mechanisms in the past to try to deal with it. About 10 years of counseling (still in it) has helped me make huge strides in getting better at loving myself. I've recently lost about 50lbs with old fashioned diet and exercise, mostly because I knew I needed to be more active for my health. Achieving this through healthy means was a big confidence booster and motivator to stay healthy in my fitness goals. My SO has been incredibly supportive about my goals in a really positive way. I had noticed him being even more strongly supportive lately, though, almost too adamantly. 


I've struggled with ED and felt myself slipping back into that some. When I brought this concern up to my SO, I got what felt like continued support for my diet/exercise efforts rather than a concern for me. This made me confused and upset but not enough to pursue it further; my SO has never experienced ED or watched someone go through it and likely doesn't totally understand the obsessive compulsive nature of it or why the idea of slipping back terrifies me. I've tried explaining a few times. He really doesn't understand why I can't just not do it.


Then this happened. While talking to my SO last week over Skype (we're in a LDR at the moment), the convo turned towards my weight loss. I brought up feeling like my SO supports my diet/exercise just because he thinks I need to lose weight. I knew after saying it that it wasn't totally fair. I needed to get it off my chest without it bottling over though. Then he confirmed what I said, adding that after losing the weight he sees me as much sexier. Now I'm sure this was meant as a compliment with no ill intent. I had initially identified the weight loss as *MY* goal without any pressure from him, so continued support of my initial goal would make sense. **But.** What I heard was every insecurity I've had about my body confirmed by someone I care about deeply. What I heard was a clear, direct connection between my weight and my attractiveness/sexiness that I immediately connected to my self-worth. I just broke down. 


This conversation is still bothering me after talking with my SO about it that night and afterwards. I've noticed huge urges to binge and purge, overexercise, etc. I've also noticed my resistance to this, which is a good sign. I tried bringing my concerns about these urges to my SO and my mom, the two most supportive people I have in my life. Both gave a ""But you look so great! You've done so much work! Keep it up!"" What. The. Fuck. Logically I can't expect them to really get it, but I did expect them to trust my sense of knowing when I'm not ok. Without having them grounding me, I'm starting to doubt my own concerns.


I know my body acceptance needs to come from me. I'm trying and trying not to let this unravel YEARS of work. I'm mindful enough to know when I'm in dangerous territory requiring some outside help and grounding. Trying to ask for extra support before I get in too deep seemed like a great idea until my fears were totally invalidated, which makes me think for a minute that maybe the urges aren't a problem. Maybe purging just one time would be ok. Maybe running those extra few miles aren't a big deal. But I know myself, I know they are issues. I just don't know how to help myself when my reality check-in with other people fails. I'm seeing my counselor tomorrow, so hopefully that helps some. In the meantime, *am I going completely insane*? Are my concerns really totally invalid?


**TL;DR** SO confirmed his support of my diet/exercise is because he thinks I need to lose weight. This created a huge setback in my body acceptance, and I feel old ED urges resurfacing. No one else seems to think this is an issue but me. **Can someone just give some validation that I'm not crazy in being worried about myself?**",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_1bo1es,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/1bo1es/twbhed_i_had_a_major_setback_and_dont_know_what/,

So now I am 130 pounds, because I injured my ankle and had to stop running for a month, and I didn't run for two months after that because the winter storms have not stopped. But now I am starting to run again whenever the weather is nice and I am not studying and I lift weights as often as I can.

But I feel bad about myself, I feel like I am uglier than everyone in school. I felt really happy when I was round 115 but I feel like my fat is really jiggling and horrible now. I liked to dress in cute, colourful clothes and dresses, but now I am afraid of dressing like that.

I feel like people would think I would look stupid to dress in cute and colourful now, because I am thicker. I feel like only thin people can dress that way without being silly. That is of course not right, I know many people that are bigger and look adorable when they dress adorable.

But I just feels like this applies to me, and I want to stop feeling horrible, but I have just been so down lately, I haven't had time to go to sleep early, nor do I feel like I deserve anything I want. 

I feel like my boyfriend is really unlucky to be with a person like me and I feel like I don't deserve being happy, and I've been sad lately.

Sorry about wenting and all, but I just needed to get this out.

I got told all of these, but never told about self acceptance, or healthy eating, or even exercise.  Yeah, grade A screw up. Anyway, I hated my body, I had no *real* friends, and teenage years were shitty. How much I weighed when I graduated (220) was more important to my mother than my GPA (3.9)  Recently (since beginning my 20s and getting the fuck away from Mommie Dearest) Ive come to really dig this body Im in. In the last five years Ive stopped caring so much about my weight and started loving my body.

Let me start off by saying: I'm fat.  I used to be a high school athlete but stopped playing sports after graduation.  I started eating a lot and didn't exercise, so little by little I gained a lot of weight.  I noticed, but didn't let it bother me.

One day I had a flash-bulb moment.  My friends and I had to walk a few flights of stairs.  I had to stop 3 times and my friends had to wait for me.  I know it sounds like a simple thing, but this was embarrassing for me.

So, I decided to get fit.  I started looking up healthy things for heavy people to do and found a lot of contradictory things.  Most places seem to suggest the traditional--increasing exercise output while eating a more limited diet.  I saw some other sites advocating HAES and sites like Thin Privilege.  These sites said that it's almost impossible to lose weight and get healthy, so just focus on enjoying your body.  This sounds good, but here's the problem.  **I'm not enjoying my body at this weight.**

At this point, I was confused.  Then I read [this](http://veup.tumblr.com/post/52234856319/some-months-ago-i-asked-a-question-to-the-social).  I want to believe that this isn't true and that I'm just naturally heavy, but something about this article feels honest to me.

     I see a therapist every week for help with my OCD/ self-esteem issues. My therapist is a firm believer in the benefits of exercise in terms of mental health. Today she once again was pushing the exercise (which is very understandable), but then she said something that shocked me. She basically told me that exercise would help me lose weight, which in turn, would lead men to actually like me. 
     I don't know why, but my stomach turned when she said that. I know I need to loose weight for health purposes, but she was implying that I could never find love if I stayed chubby. I just left the session confused. My self confidence has slowly been growing over these past few months, but what she said just killed me. 
     I know this story is one of common occurrence, but I just felt the need to share. I know a love based on superficial standards is not a good one. I know that I am still a kind person no matter how I look, but at this time the self talk seems to be doing nothing for me.

There are many possible reasons for this. I was bullied beyond belief in grade school, was repeatedly raped by my mother's boyfriend when I was 6, and up until my current boyfriend...guys have always made me feel like their last resort...the girl they're with because they can't get with anyone else at that time. I don't really think the cause matters too much. I just want to know how to get better for both my and my boyfriend's sake.
It wasn't too bad for the first few months of our relationship. At least, not jealousy wise. Back then, I couldn't undress in front of him, I didn't allow him to touch the areas of my body that I don't like, sex was strictly to take place in pitch black darkness. I don't really have those problems as much anymore. I undress in front of him quite often, but I do still have bad days/weeks where I need to change in another room or with the lights off. I get bad skin breakouts on my back and I have red bumps on my arms, and I'm a bit on the thicker side. I have lost a lot of weight, though.
Anyway, my biggest problem is him seeing other girls' bodies. When we're at school or at the mall and there's an attractive girl nearby, I feel like running and hiding. I, literally, panic. A week ago, I caught him looking at some cheerleaders on TV. He didn't mean to look, but he did. Later, I had an anxiety attack in his bathroom. I'm dreading our first summer together because there will be half naked girls everywhere. I'll have nonstop anxiety. It makes me feel sickly. I get upset when we watch a movie that has a naked or sexually suggestive female in it (THERE AREN'T A LOT OF MOVIES THAT DON'T HAVE IT ANYMORE). 
When I go to work, I spend my whole shift panicking and pacing and constantly checking my phone for texts from him. I can't help but think about what's popping up on Reddit that he's seeing or what hot chick he might be glancing at at the mall without me there or what movie he's watching without me there.
He knows about my problem and he's been patient and loving. But I can tell he's getting fed up with my constant anxiety, restrictions, and crying. I know I am fed up. I hate feeling like this. I need to know how to make myself better to save my relationship and myself.

Please don't suggest therapy. I've been in it since I was 12 and hasn't done me any good. It isn't for everyone.

Before then I was thin without trying and food wasn't something I ever really thought about. I developed an eating disorder, started obsessing about food and calories and got down to under 100lbs. Eventually I started eating my feelings instead and I gained weight to reach my highest weight. After a few years my weight slowly came down and I was more or less what I was before everything started, but my relationship with food remained terrible.

I'm always worried about what I weigh and what I'm eating. Food isn't fun or something to enjoy, it just makes me miserable. Anyway, my sister was always heavier than me but I wouldn't call her overweight at any point. She just recently lost a lot of weight and is very small right now. I absolutely hate being around her. I try to avoid her if I can. I *know* that she judges how I look and she's constantly judging who is smaller than her and who is bigger. She is going a lot of things that I did when I had an eating disorder (like cooking/baking for other people all of the time but refusing to eat it herself) so I don't think it's a healthy weight loss.

In terms of her judging, the other day I was at her house with a few other people and she asked if I wanted to go through some clothes she was going to get rid of. I said sure (I'm poor, free clothes are free clothes) I dumped the pants out on the floor to go through them and she said something like ""No, not here! These are my fat jeans."" Thanks a lot. So you're embarrassed of the clothes THAT YOU'RE OFFERING ME AND THINKING I CAN FIT INTO.

It's just tough. I try to have a normal relationship with my body but being around her makes it absolutely impossible. I'm feeling pretty miserable about myself and I'm finding myself wanting to really restrict what I'm eating just to get smaller again.

I'm overweight.  Well, I think I am.  I honestly don't know anymore.  Other people are shocked and taken aback when I tell them how I feel about my body, and they reassure me that I don't have a weight problem.  Regardless, I am not the weight I want to be, and to me, it is painfully evident in every aspect of my life.  

""If you're not happy, then do something about it,"" I am told.  Diet.  Exercise.  All the things I know I can be so good at.  I feel like I have done nothing but try for so long.  When I diet, I am constantly battling the urge to take it overboard, to make that 1200 calorie daily limit 1000, then 800, then 600...  I can't view food healthily.  It feels evil.  Every time I eat, I feel like I'm giving in somehow.  

""Talk to someone,"" I'm told.  I have a psychiatrist and a therapist, and I feel that both are useless to me when it comes to this.  I've kept it from my psychiatrist deliberately because I knew she wouldn't be able to prescribe Wellbutrin if she knew, and no other antidepressant has ever helped me.  My therapist knows, but she doesn't seem to grasp that it's an actual problem.  I have walked into her office and basically opened with, ""I'm not eating anymore,"" and her sole response was to tell me how stressed out I was and how it was just a symptom of that.  And how my stress is due to positive changes in my life, so really, I'm doing great!  I've had multiple other therapists, and they have all reacted similarly.  At this point, I think I just suck at communication, but I do my best to be blunt and hide nothing.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  

I feel like I take up too much space.  I feel like I'm trapped inside a prison I can't shed.  I feel bound.  I feel like no matter what I do, I will never be able to meet even the most basic weight goals I have.

It's up to each of us to wear or not wear whatever we want on our skin and bodies, for any reason whatsoever.

--------------
I used to hate the way my face looked. I wore makeup everyday because I was embarrassed of my complexion, pores, undereyes, etc. I stopped about 5 years ago, and now the idea of coving myself up everyday is not only gross but weird. Until I stopped wearing it, I never really discussed it with anyone. But after I noticed such a wonderful change in my self-confidence, I began to ask others about their decision to wear it.


What I found is that: 
1) it's 99.9% women, not men who wear it, and 

2) damn near everyone is *extremely* defensive. And when they're not defensive, they're self deprecating. They say things like: ""well, I just don't have your natural beauty"", ""I look disgusting without it"", or ""I'm too old looking"".

Most people say it's just for themselves, not because they're trying to impress people or look more like some ""beauty"" standard. But then why don't they wear it when they're lounging around the house or going out to places where people won't see them?

How do you guys feel about it? Does anyone else feel like we need more activism to show women and young girls that they're faces are beautiful too? I hear so much about loving your body, but our faces are part of our bodies!

Every time the subject gets brought up, there's a huge influx of comments calling the practice barbaric mutilation, and your parents hated you for doing it for no reason, and trolls saying ""you'll never know what real sex feels like."" If you ever make a comment about being happy with being circumcised, or defending the practice by citing the medical benefits of the procedure, there's always someone there to post ""looks like someone is unhappy their parents chopped off their willy fringe."" 

I don't get it, why is everyone on the internet so hell-bent about making circumcised men insecure? It's almost as if there's a league that exists dedicated to defending the holy honor of the foreskin, because every news article about the procedure is loaded with heated comments and nasty remarks. What gives? I understand if they want to protect newborn babies from pain, and the man should have the right to choose to undergo the procedure or not. But why do people go out of their way trying to psychologically assault cut men? For instance, I came across [this Yahoo Answers page](http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306103532AABR72T) on why Michael Angelo's statue of David looks uncut when David was Jewish. Scroll down 3 or 4 posts to see the troll posts. None of them are answering the question, they're just railing against the procedure and saying how much sensitivity you lose, and how you'll never enjoy sex, and how you're mutilated, and your manhood was stolen at birth, and you should just fucking kill yourself. When you come across forums discussing the topic, there are always some circumcised men also railing against the procedure, saying how much they hate their parents and they would do anything to have their foreskin back, and how their entire lives are ruined because of a flap of skin. Why do people behave in this manner about this topic? I don't understand. Why is it not okay to be happy with your circumcised penis?

I was circumcised at birth, but I was also born with a birth defect called a hypospadias, which affects the urethra and foreskin. So even if my parents didn't get me cut at birth, I would have had to undergo the procedure anyway, because my urethral opening was misplaced underneath the foreskin. In other words, it was doomed from the start. So I'm a special case, but I happen to like my penis. From the surgery to correct my birth defect, I have a scar from where I had the stitches running lengthwise down the shaft. Not many people can say they have such a unique penis. I got a Staph infection after the surgery, and I literally almost lost my penis. Fortunately I was cured by antibiotics, and I never lost my penis. I'm lucky to have a penis in the first place, let alone a larger-than-average and fully functional one. 

So I take offense when people make comments about mutilation, because if circumcision is mutilation, then my dick is ultra-super mutilated from the surgery. If you found out someone was in a wheelchair, would these same people go out of their way to let him know how he's missing out on walking and running? No. But when they find out someone is circumcised, they go out of their way to torment and bully him psychologically about how he's not a complete man, and he'll never know what ""real sex"" feels like. Why is it not okay for a man to be happy with his penis? Please, if you are one of these people, explain yourself. I understand your intentions to save the babies.

Everything is emotionally piling up. ,lankyd,14,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/xfly0/im_a_guy_and_i_have_low_weight_issues_and_low/,"Everyone around me, people I don't even fucking know comment on how I'm so skinny and sometimes I just want to **SHOUT** at them at the top of my lungs.


and I start to feel like shit about the whole thing and it's starting to really bother me. I just find it amazing how it's so accepted to point out someone's weight, and even straight up ask what their weight is when they're skinny.

Recently I've had a lot of run ins with people making random comments and it sort of piled up emotionally...

Right now I'm feeling extremely self conscience, depressed, and bad about myself. I've had self imposed celibacy for a long time.

I'm really lonely but at the same time I have low self esteem...I can never make that jump into any intimacy with any girl I date..due to my self esteem...thus I eventually just stop. Sometimes I talk to women I'm interested in and and ask myself what the point of even talking to them is...because I'll eventually stop. To add to my pressures and anxieties I'm a virgin..and I'm inexperienced so I feel extremely scared of telling someone or meeting some girls that are more experienced than me because of the stigma of my inexperience. sometimes i can't imagine why or how a girl would like me, and i feel inferior as a guy so i feel like a girl is settling with me..like i'm a consolation prize and second choice. i constantly feel like i have to try harder and convince a girl to like me..and that's really what most guys have to do..it just feels bad. 

I have a ton of issues that gather up together to make this terrible concoction of frustration, loneliness, depression, lack of self esteem, self consciousness. i'm very aware of all this and it's frustrating, I just want to break out..I feel trapped.


I dislike how my face looks, I dislike my nose, which is broken, I dislike my low weight which makes me feel inferior and unmanly..and weak, I dislike my lack of success in life, I dislike my depression, I dislike my body hair, I dislike my lack of muscle.

I dislike my loneliness, I dislike my self imposed celibacy and lack of experience and intimacy, and how I'm getting older and feeling more pressure because of the stigma. I dislike how I can't sleep and have wrinkles and huge eyebags under my eyes despite being very young. I'm thinking of doing something about them..but I doubt I will ever be successful enough to get disposable income.

I feel very emasculated as a guy, due to my weight. I'm extremely frustrated at life..in all facets.

I really dislike my face, and my nose, and my lack of jawline. One time I went to /r/ladyboners and I came out feeling extremely depressedt. To make matters worse my siblings are all more attractive than me. I'm the ugly duckling.

I hate the fact that even if I gain weight my face will still look terrible and shitty, and there's nothing I can ever do about that. I really dislike how my face looks and sometimes I'm scared to kiss a girl because I don't my face to be so close to someone else's.

I dress very well in a way that compliments my body, and I feel confident as long as my whole body and arms are covered(I'm self conscience about my arms and wrists) but whenever I take off the layers for the summer people notice. I no longer dress in summer clothes(shorts). I already take care of myself in terms of grooming, hair, hygiene to maintain what little confidence i have so I'm okay with any advice on that.


For example I have a girl who's a friend who always comments on my weight. Also all my guy friends give me shit about it too, telling me I'm pathetically weak.

I was out on a date with a girl a couple days ago and she commented on how I was really skinny and asked me for my weight, I'm really considering just never talking to her. We also had a little wrestle fight and I felt really bad at the end, I felt weak and inferior and very emasculated at my lack of strength. Another two girls I was out with recently commented on how some guy they were playing hard to get with was a total hunk and had a nice body..and how they were trying to get a threesome jokingly...while they were out with me on a semi date...attempting to make me feel jealous. they were openly talking about these guys who were bigger and more handsome than me...right in front of me..and I felt terrible right after that.

everyone mentions it, and they're completely unapologetic about it. 

even my parents make fun of me, they tell me I have no butt and I feel like crying. I'm feeling extremely self conscious, angry and annoyed. I've been going to the gym inconsistently but I had really bad illness for 3 weeks and lost the 10 lbs of gains I had and I feel really crushed because it was extremely difficult getting those gains because I don't have access to a lot of food or protein. watching my weight fall back down was...a really bad experience.

I haven't been going to the gym since I got better due to various things..it took me forever to get over my fear of going to the gym and having people watch me. I have another issue of not having much food because I'm broke and my mom doesn't cook(pathetic i know), so I don't get much calories unless I go out to eat..and I only have about $200. even bulking and trying to improve myself takes money. it's frustrating. I'm going go have my first meal....maybe...

i'm depressed and self conscious about my weight, my face, my inexperience, and it distances me from people and makes me feel very scared to get close to people. i constantly feel like people point out my weight. i'm very low right now. i keep looking at my face and the bags under my eyes...even in my face it shows...the sadness..I have a lot of wrinkles.

I know I don't have to justify why I have this attraction, but I'd like to mention that I've always found size lovely. The problem is I'm not sure if he is accepting of his body, and I'm not sure if I'd be hurting him more than I would be empowering him if I told him. I've gone as far as telling him I think him in his entirety is sexy (as I wouldn't base any relationship purely on physical attraction), as that's the truth, although I get a feeling he expects me to be reproachful of his size. I guess I mostly feel guilt for liking his stomach especially, as that seems to be what he is most sensitive about.

Any advice is welcome and thanks in advance.

edit: thank you all and thank you for those still inputting advice and perspective. I went ahead and told him.

It healed really well, only leaving a white patch right below my knee (also received a smaller one on my other knee, and two on my foot from the same incident). This scar is bad-ass, how can you not be proud of a scar you received because you saved a life?


Fast forward to April this year, I had to undergo major abdominal surgery to remove a large tumor, and it left a gnarly purple scar down from my belly button. I'm really struggling to accept this scar as part of my body, every time I look at it, I think about everything I had to go through, the pain, the worry that the tumor will grow back, the fact I might not be able to bear children, knowing that I will most probably need another surgery in a few years time...


I'm worried about wearing a bathing suit at the beach, not only because exposing the scar will make it worse but because of the looks I think I'm getting, I'm sure no one really cares, but it bothers me all the same. It doesn't help that the doctors I've seen since the surgery all seem to make the same comments about how [I really didn't scar well](http://i.imgur.com/GF39c.jpg).


I'd really love to hear how others have come to terms with their scars, how did you learn to love them/embrace them? Have you found any ways of minimizing them? How long will it really take to fade? Are people really staring as much as I think they are? How have you dealt with the looks and the questions?

She's 6'1'' and right away you can see that she is fairly skinny. She told me upfront that she used to have an eating disorder that she was hospitalized for years ago, but that she had ultimately recovered. 

I believed her, even though I only saw her eat little snacks and she went to the gym every day. I guess that I wanted to give her benefit of the doubt.

Last night she came home late with mascara running down her cheeks. She told me she had relapsed, and was going to the hospital. I had no idea what to say. I asked if I could help her pack or if she needed anything, but she refused. 

We have become very close friends, and, 2X, I'm very worried. She came home at midnight that same night and we talked about it. She opened up and told me everything. I've been eating meals with her lately because she said it's easier to eat with someone else.

BUT I'm scared. I want to help her but I don't know how. Just now for dinner she had a couple spoonfuls of soup and put the rest in the fridge because ""she wasn't feeling it"", and then proceeded to eat celery and peanut butter.

I want to encourage her to eat more, but I also don't want to seem bossy or mother-like. I want to be her friend and I want to help her, but I don't know how... Any suggestions?

I wouldn't even let my husband touch my stomach. Then, one day, I was at a friend's explaining something diet/fat related.. maybe it was about how tofu noodles only have 20 calories or something like that... then she said she had a book I should borrow and handed me Lessons From The Fat-O-Sphere. I thought it was another ""you're a goddess, love yourself!"" type of books- I'd read them before and they simply cause a massive eyeroll.

So I started reading it and it's the type of book that pisses you off every single chapter because this is *not* what you've been told your whole life.. you're told, and you believe, that if you just keep trying, if you just stop being so (insert whatever) then you will lose weight and then everyone will love you and life will be roses and sunshine- being thin is the key to happiness after all, right? But after the anger came the sadness.. because, once you believe what the book is saying, you realize that your dreams of being thin (the fantasy of thin) isn't really real.. and you're not going to get there by dieting. 

I was dieting when I read the book.. counting calories.. the more I counted the less I ate until I was down to 300 a day or so. I felt like crap. A few days after I finished the book I stopped. The other day I wanted cupcakes... but I felt so incredibly awful for wanting to make them that I decided to go ahead and make them just because no food is allowed to make me feel *that* bad. They were vegan chocolate cupcakes with chocolate icing- and they were good! :-) 

Since reading that book I've stopped dieting, I started letting my husband touch the fat parts that I always hated before, I had boudoir photos taken (something I *never* would have done before), and I signed up on the website ModelMayhem.com and already have two shoots set up. I asked the question that started this subreddit and I'm so glad for it. I never would have had the confidence to do any of it without that book. I'm not perfect, I don't totally love myself and I still feel bad when thinking about the calories in this or that.. but I'm getting there.

I am so depressed about it I can hardly function anymore and I have lost all of my productivity. 

I hate the way that I look. All I want is to be good looking. Every time I am at the gym or at school and I see good looking guys there, I get so jealous and depressed. These good looking guys seem so happy and everyone else likes them. 

Every time I look in a mirror and even see my reflection I almost start crying because I realize that I am not good looking. I cant stand being so depressed anymore. I am considering not going to the gym anymore because no matter how good my body looks, my face will always be below average. The other aspects of my life are sort of good, but all I think about is my looks. I would literally trade anything to be good looking. I would rather have everything else in my life be terrible, but get to be good looking. 

Everyday I am getting more depressed. My parents and my friends don't even know how depressed I am. They probably think I am happy and just fine when they see me. When they look at me they  think i am fine, but have no idea that I am dead on the inside and close to killing myself. 

I dont want to go to therapy or have medication, all I want is to be good looking. Even if I took medication and was happy, I would still not be good looking.

My grandmother raised my mom to fear weight gain (my grandmother was ""overweight"" in her teens and early twenties). And while my mom did better than my grandmother, there were always sticky notes with her weight on the cupboard to ""stop her from eating"". Needless to say, I developed some disordered eating patterns as a teen. I wouldn't say I had an eating disorder, but I would occasionally binge/purge and eat very few calories. Anyway, I gained a significant amount of weight in college and have been trying to go about eating better and exercising  in a healthy way without focusing on weight loss so much. But recently, as I said, I haven't really been charge of what goes into my meals. I do help out and cook, but I make what their family wants me to. I feel uncomfortable and about 100 pounds heavier!

I want to start off my saying a) how amazing and helpful this community is… seriously you guys are all so awesome! and b) I’m not 100% certain but the following miiiight contain some ED-related triggers, so please be warned!

Also, I’m not super sure if this is the right subreddit for this… please feel free to redirect me if it’s not :)

So, okay. To provide some backstory, I am a college-aged girl who has suffered with extreme anorexia during and a little beyond high school (hospital visits, counseling, pulled from all sports teams… the whole works). I was completely obsessed with food and exercise and my body, and while I’m in a much better place now (I’m at a relatively healthy weight and I eat every day, and it’s not nearly as hard as it used to be!), it still very much a daily struggle, but I work really hard at staying healthy because I definitely don’t want to go back to where I used to be because it was very dark and absolutely terrible. 

However, one of my very close friends is also a college-age girl, and she is very overweight (and the sweetest person ever. I adore her). But lately she has been doing this new weight-loss regime thing through the rec programs at our university, and has been losing a little bit of weight, and it has been making me feel really panicked because I remember what that’s like and I feel the need to keep up with her, or parallel her weight loss with mine (which is the opposite of what I should be doing). I know that sounds really stupid, and I feel really stupid for still not growing out of that mentality after all this time. But the thing is, my friend isn’t bragging and touting her success all over the place… if that were the case I would just politely, privately tell her that it makes me really uncomfortable (she and I are very close, so she knows about my history with EDs). That’s not the case, though—she is actually keeping pretty mum about it. And I don’t want to confront her about it, because she’s doing something healthy for herself and I definitely don’t want to discourage her from that. It’s just, I feel myself slipping and it really scares me and I’m not sure what to do. What should I do?

So, basic stats are I'm 38, a lady, and have been morbidly obese since the end of high school. I decided though when I was younger that I wasn't going to let that hold me back, because fuck the people who mocked and made fun of me. I've hiked mountains, I spin fire poi for fun, and a slew of other things that are not 'typical fat lady ashamed things'. I have lots of friends, male and female, straight and not. Over all, I have a pretty fun and interesting life... not without it's pitfalls, I am going through a stressful patch at the moment. But yeah, I'm mostly content with being me. 

The rub is, I have never been able to keep a relationship going for longer than a year, and I rarely date, and I think it's because of how I look. 

I used to think that while men do tend to gravitate towards the cultural norm, that there was indeed a smaller percentage of guys that are attracted to my body type. However my 20 years of dating experience belays that... and yeah I don't think it's just the weight but I think it's a major factor. When I'm around my straight guy friends, it's like my gender becomes invisible. I know how guys talk about the women they're attracted to, and I know I'm not one of them based off of what they say. In the few and brief relationships I have had, the guys often get shit about dating a bigger girl, and at least in one occasion has lead to a breakup. I am coming to the conclusion that it doesn't matter who I am, or all the awesome stuff I do, or how funny I am, how kind or... anything. It just seems that guys who want relationships go after what they are attracted to first, and personality second.

Not that I have a problem getting laid. Quite the opposite. Since my last relationship ended 6 years ago I have occasionally hooked up with acquaintances or friends of friends, or people from dating sites. I've stopped that, because I always feel empty and unhappy afterwards. They don't want to have sex with -me-, I discovered, they just want to have sex, and nearly any vagina will do. I just happened to be the one that said 'sure'. The more often that happened, with the guy not calling back unless he wanted to get laid again, or not wanting to hang out unless sex was on the table, the less interested I became in sex. I was beginning to wonder what was wrong with me, until I recently realized that I won't enjoy sex unless 'I' feel wanted and desired, and I rarely do. 

Since my last relationship imploded I've been having a hard time letting anyone in. He was the one who's friends had an issue with my size, and when he broke up with me (over the phone), he didn't give me a reason. I really loved him, I think he was the first person I ever allowed myself to love in that way. Since then I've been on 6 to 8 first dates in the past 6 years, mostly on purpose. I'm just not trying anymore, and the guys I did end up going to dinner with were just didn't click with me. 

I've lost nearly 45 pounds in the past year, and I have 120 to go. I have loose skin, and although people often guess my age to be 8-10 years younger than my actual age I feel old, and gross. I belong to a camping community where clothing is optional and I have many good friends there. It's probably the least judgmental place on the planet when it comes to body type, and I've seen all shapes, sizes, able and disabled folks there in all manner of undress, and to me it's all good. Other people's nudity doesn't bother me one bit, and I always encourage others to push boundaries. But one day I went over to a friend's house, and they were having a 'topless party', all sitting on the floor, eating nachos, having lols. I couldn't do it, I felt so awkward and horrible about it, because I know it's not something that should bother me, especially with this group of people but it so does, because I know down deep what they would think of me. Fat, gross, repellent, even if they never said it out loud. I've tried to explain it to some of my close friends and they don't get it. They try to be understanding, and they would never push me to do something I felt uncomfortable with, but they don't really understand why this is such a core issue and why I can be such a hypocrite. Also, one of my good friends recently told me that I appear to feel like I would be happier in a relationship. I don't know if I would be happier (grass always be greener), but I do want to be wanted. 

Thing is, people think I'm so together, and so happy being single. Part of that is true... but, I think I'm becoming one of those bitter 40 yr olds that'll knit sweaters out of their pet's fur and talk angrily about how the opposite sex and how it's so much better being alone, because talking up being alone is better than feeling like you have no choice.

I'm just waiting for someone to prove me wrong about everything, but I question whether that'll ever happen. Older I get the less likely I'll be able to form a LTR I think. ",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_12z8r5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/12z8r5/feeling_forever_alone/,

For the first time since I was 11, I asked for help today, and I can't help but be perplexed at how afraid I am. I've been referred to a counselor/therapist, only now I have to wait a few weeks if not months.

When I've told people how I view myself, my attitudes about my body and how the fact that anyone could value me physically utterly dumbfounds me, I'm met with one of two things. Usually with disbelief from friends, people I actually genuinely believe that care. Coupled with reassurance and compliments that are designed to help, it actually makes the situation worse. Because I just feel like saying ""Don't lie to me.""

Other people, people like my family who are, granted, not as aware as my friends are about some of the things I've been through in my life (sexual abuse, rape, psychological trauma and manipulation), usually greet me with a stern, and even amused. ""Don't be ridiculous. There's nothing wrong with you."" Amused, like it's a joke I've just told them, rather than how much I hate myself.

Since I was 11 my coping mechanism was to bottle all my feelings away. If I just pretended that the issues weren't there, I could carry on and be vaguely happy. But the time that went on, the more I realised that vaguely happy, wasn't happy at all, it was just a facade. I broke up with my partner of seven years because I want her to be happy, and I've always thought I was holding her back. She doesn't think the relationship is over, and keeps trying to convince me to let her help, to let her be with me and support me. But I don't think I can do this with her worrying at me, and telling me it'll be alright in the end when she doesn't know for sure if it will be. No one knows.

I'm so scared that I'll go to therapy, and I'll be forced to confront myself both mentally and physically in an effort to make things better, and it won't help, or make everything even worse. 

I don't even know if I have Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I reached out yesterday after curving a panic attack and found a BDD chat room to talk to someone. All I got was ""That's not BDD. That's just low self esteem"".  How is that supposed to help me?  If I have self esteem issues like you say, telling me that what I said I think is wrong with me is incorrect... doesn't that make it worse?

Sometimes I don't think people understand at all, how hard it is to hate yourself or hate something about yourself with so much venom that you're suffocating in it. And I just want to be free it without people suffocating me as well.",,False,self,t5_2s3ye,False,,,True,t3_zrf2i,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/zrf2i/bdd_and_me_trigger_warnings_not_a_happy_bunny_in/,

I'm supposed to be wearing a bikini for the first time in years next week...I just went from excited to terrified over night. ,Malcriao,16,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/BodyAcceptance/comments/yo691/how_do_yall_get_your_confidence_back_when_it/,"I'm so excited for this vacation, we're going to Osoyoos, BC!  So beautiful, amazing weather, lovely town.  I'm only 18 and I work these crazy 10-12 hour shifts and I haven't had more than one day off work in forever.  So basically, I need this! Sorry, off topic.  I'm gonna go ahead and rant for a minute here if you don't mind, because I just want to get this off my chest. 

I was there last summer as well, and refused to take my tank top and denim shorts off.  I didn't get to work on my tan, or enjoy the water, or anything really.  Silly, right?  I feel like since then I have come a long way.  I've started lifting weights, and holy has that boosted my confidence.  I have these muscles Ive never had before, and strength I never thought I'd have. I've learned that the layer of fat I keep over my muscle is healthy, it's just the way I'm built.  There have even been times when I've liked my figure! A lot!

I thought this year I was going to kick ass on the beach! I was all ready to bust out my salsa moves and maybe meet some cool people.  I bought this ADORABLE little black bikini.  Something I would never have even considered before.  I tried it on, and I thought I looked great! It held all my boobs up (usually a challenge lol), it balanced me out perfectly and it was so comfy!  And stylish!  I was so excited.  I was like, 'oh gurl, look at your hips in this! you're fuckin hot! dang mami you fine'. I talk to myself in my head like that when I'm feelin good.  

Oh man, I was on top of the world.  For the first time ever I have this amazing feeling of a healthy body.  I don't even look that much different! But I feel so much healthier.  So with that confidence I bought some cute dresses and wraps, and I could barely sleep I was so excited to shake it on the beach. 

I didn't notice any of those little imperfections I usually loose my mind over -*I'm looking at you awkward bra strap area fat*- which admittedly aren't even that bad! Hell even my ass, which I worry about the most, looked pretty great.  

Fuck yeah. 

Well, I wake up today to show my little sister what I bought, we try on our stuff together and BAM! I LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND ALL I CAN SEE ARE THE LITTLE BITS OF CHUB STICKING OUT EVERYWHERE. MY FIRST THOUGHT IS 'EW WHO DRESSED THE HAM?'  *WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?* 

I know I look the same in the clothes, my little sister told me I looked great, so why don't I see it anymore?  What the hell changed?  In my mind I know that these bits of chub are really not that bad, mostly just skin and a thin layer of pizza and beer.  Whatever, I'm healthy.  I know I am.  So why don't I feel good anymore?

Has this happened to any one else? It's like I woke up and all the confidence I had just died and now I'm depressed and terrified of going on this vacation because I don't want anyone seeing my  chubbies.  I don't know how to overcome this!  It's so illogical and it seems so silly, but I go to look in the mirror and my mind just jumps to 'wow look at how lumpy that belly is.  you look like a ham.' 

I want to enjoy this vacation so bad, but now Im scared I won't be able to get my confidence back :(

With the job come the injuries, and I had my fair share of them. However, I always managed to bounce back from them and continue to dance. Two weeks before my last professional exam, I couldn't bounce back any more. One year later, I am finally in the process of getting a date for hip surgery. I'm 19 years old.

Because of my constant struggle with pain, I have gone from being able to dance for hours at a time to not being able to walk two blocks. I have not been able to exercise like I used to, and with the loss of my passion in life I have become depressed. I don't really want to say how much weight I've gained, but it's more than enough to make me feel terrible about myself. 

My question to you, Redditors, is how can I feel good about myself while I wait for surgery?

It was a huge change from the sort of attitude I am used to. I admit I was scared being naked in front of my friend at first but it was just so natural after a while.
Although I have pretty good self-esteem already, it made me realise that everyone looks pretty much the same. Even though I was a foreigner and some kids were staring at me, everyone was a bit wobbly and had all kinds of different sizes and shapes of body.
I have a lot of self-conscious friends and can't help but feel that if we'd grown up in this environment, they'd have less issues with their bodies.

I'll try to keep this short.  
  
At my largest, I was about 250lb, and I'm 5'4"". Lost a lot of weight over a period of about 3 years, and got down to about 144lb. Now I'm hovering around 156lb. I realize that's completely average, and I should be happy to have achieved such a great goal. But... I've had body image issues my entire life, &amp; they haven't disappeared w/ the weight. (This could be due to the fact that my nickname all throughout grade school was ""Wide Load."" :( )

  
  
Anyway, back to the point. I have finally^perhaps^maybe after almost 5ish years of keeping the weight off, decided to wear a bikini this summer.  
  
  
I'm scared. I have flabby skin all over my body from being very large before. And while it might not bother most people, it really really really bothers me. I'm just afraid that once I get out there to the beach, wearing my first two-piece evar, someone will laugh at me, or make a rude comment. Just need some encouragement, or some similar experiences?

I don't think anyone deserves to be shamed or stigmatized for their choices or their bodies, but do you think that it's ever acceptable to say that someone needs to lose weight out of genuine concern for their health?

Also, there are legitimate life improvement changes that happen when an overweight person loses weight.  I've experienced many of them, even though I'm still overweight, and these are *not* all due to the way that people treat you.  Do you disagree that these benefits exist or do you think that they're just minimally important or what?
