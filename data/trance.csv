I've performed at big events and places, such as Antwerp's Sportpaleis, Tomorrowland Festival, Dance Valley in NL, The Auckland Town Hall, and many, many clubs worldwide. Beyond that I'm a true activist for the real sound of ""trance"", and I cover all of its territories with a bunch of aliases which I release music under.

So after I started my [website](http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/rx62x/hey_all_remember_when_i_asked_if_you_were/) writing about EDM as a hobby, I wrote a review for a track and posted it as a comment on the YouTube video of the song. Well, a couple of days later, the owner/manager of the record company contacted me and asked if I'd like to work with the company to write for them.

It's not a lot of work and doesn't pay much since it's a very small company, but writing reviews for a living is a dream job of mine, and this is a perfect gateway into the industry.

Pretty fuckin' crazy. Dreams do come true after all!

For the next hour or so he got progressively louder and more intense but refused to go to the template of most DJs where they just drop bangers to get the crowd going. around midnight he knew... The crowd was his to control. Marcus proceeded to drop all his big songs you'd hear in a festival set intertwined with heavier beats in between. at around 3AM the drunkards were heading home so there was finally room to dance for the real fans, Marcus continued to drop hit after hit.  At around 5AM Markus had us in a tight grip, this is where his dark side really showed. He got on the mic and said, ""hello Toronto, this is my favorite part of the night..."". He then lead us into the ""Rabbit Hole"". Most people thought he was amazing before this point but the ""Rabbit Hole"" is where he showed his true colours . the music just got darker and wilder, the morning sun shined through the club every time the smoking doors opend but Markus continued to spin his nasty tunes with an almost demonic smile on his face, everyone in the crowd Knew they were in his tight grasp at this point and he could make them dance 'till they collapsed if he wished. Just after 7:30AM he put on Tiesto's ""Touch me"", he then took of his headphones and and took a bow, He also signed autographs and shook hands with those who survived the night.

So I've always liked electronic music, but the best part has always been to beautiful melodic parts rather than the repetitive drum beats in many electronic songs.  Today I decided to try out spotify, and I discovered trance.... Holy shit, all of this music is incredible!  I made a giant playlist with a lot of armen van buurin and other people.  I simply can't get enough of it.  

It'd be great if you guys could point me in the right direction of good artists/songs, or websites or basically anything cool trance related.  

So yeah.  Trance is awesome.

**EDIT:** So after a bunch of listening to may different artists, I've found someone that I absolutely love, Shogun.  Each song is just perfect in my opinion, especially Lotus, and Skyfire.

I hope I and the other moderators have served you well and I promise that we will continue to help the subreddit to grow even better.

Just want to say thank you everyone for participating and contributing as always!

Your humble moderator,

**[Solarstone &amp; Clare Stagg - The Spell (Solarstone's Pure Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bAo69SJwFk)**

With its first big radio play on the ASOT 550 London Mix, Solarstone has taken the trance world by storm with his 2012 push for ""Pure Trance."" The first single from his outstanding album ""Pure,"" Clare Stagg and Solarstone create a superb trance melody that's sure to capture fans of all genres of trance.  Released by Black Hole Recordings on April 16th, 2012, here's what the record label has to say:

&gt;""'The Spell' is the first track out of the box from DJ/producer/legend Solarstone's forthcoming 2012 studio album. Featuring the folk-tinged vocal delivery of current Solar muse Clare Stagg, its absorbing lyrics balance aching lament with its un-crushable spirit of optimism. Don't be fooled though... Behind 'The Spell's immersive vocal splendour beats the hypersonic heart of an absolute floor monster. The track is the latest to arrive under Richard's Pure Trance banner. You will find no house gimmicks here. No electro or dubstep stunts, props or devices. With its running bass, bleep-fuelled entrancing lead line and speaker-challenging drums, 'The Spell' is 100% uncorrupted, Pure Trance. So say it with pride.""

**[Armin van Buuren featuring Ana Criado - I'll Listen (Original Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hH9ObJQAqc)**

Many were a bit shocked after hearing Armin's first collaboration with Ana Criado this year, ""Suddenly Summer.""  A slow shift in musical styles on his weekly podcast, A State of Trance, followed by his Euro-anthem ""We Are Here To Make Some Noise,"" many thought Armin was finally abandoning fans of his older style of music: pursing ""Mirage"" sounds over ""Imagine"" sounds.  ""Suddenly Summer"" changed that, becoming an instant best-seller on Beatport.  So Armin went back to the studio with Ana Criado and produced a follow up: ""I'll Listen.""  The results of sales and our r/trance survey don't lie: ""I'll Listen"" completely surpassed ""Suddenly Summer"" on many levels and was played non-stop on radio shows everywhere.  Released on the famous Armind label of the Armada Empire on September 10th, 2012, here's what the record label had to say about the release:

&gt;""When the world needs a new anthem to adore, it's exactly what Armin van Buuren provides. The official follow-up to the beloved 'Suddenly Summer', is the warm and enchanting 'I'll Listen', featuring Ana Criado.  Trending topics, top selling on Beatport and still a highlight to each of Armin's massive gigs. 'Suddenly Summer' is a tune that many a trance fan has locked inside their hearts, but we're pretty sure there's room left for its successor.  'I'll Listen' lights the listener's soul with warm melody, deep and proggy bass and spellbinding vocals by one of EDM's favorite singers. Another taste of midsummer's warmth, be prepared to meet it on the dance floor.

## #3

**[Omnia &amp; IRA - The Fusion (Original Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGXv2J14glY)**

What do you get when you combine a superb and rising trance producer with a ridiculously catchy melody and heavily altered vocals?  You get this: ""The Fusion.""  Featured on two compilations this year, Omnia &amp; IRA took the trance world by storm with this future Coldharbour Classic.  Despite shouts of ""trouse"" or ""This ripped off Gareth Emery's 'Tokyo,' "" this song became one of the most played songs in live sets and radio shows for months.  Perhaps for good reasons: this clocked in at #3 this year!  Released on Coldharbour Recordings (part of Armada) on March 26th, 2012, here's what the record label had to say:

&gt;Featuring on both Markus Schulz's Los Angeles '12 and Armin van Buuren's A State of Trance 2012 compilations is quite an achievement. But for talented Ukranian Omnia, it is just the latest step in his ascending career as a producer, and in parallel, projects Smart Apes member DJ Ira to the forefront. They combine to present ""The Fusion"".  
Omnia is no stranger to Coldharbour followers, with his remix of Markus Schulz's seminal Surreal in 2011 amassing a plethora of plaudits. Together with The Blizzard, he has been part of some of the most well received melodic tracks in recent years, such as ""My Inner Island"", and the beautiful ""Closer"" which featured the wonderful vocals of Susana. Ira's work as Smart Apes has also struck a chord with Global DJ Broadcast, notably with their track ""Perfect"".
Since the turn of the year, very few tracks have garnered as much attention as The Fusion. Not just with its two compilation berths, the track has featured extensively in both Markus and Armin's livesets, from the release parties at Avalon in Los Angles and the Global DJ Broadcast World Tour from the Guvernment in Toronto, to the opening night of the A State of Trance 550 celebrations in London and a proud moment for Omnia himself playing in front of his fellow country members in Kiev.
As well as the original, Markus kindly supplies his own reconstruction of the track, crafted specifically for the Los Angeles '12 compilation. Many are citing the track as a track of the year contender already. And with heavyweight support behind it, The Fusion looks set to explode further. 

## #2 

**[Andrew Rayel featuring Jano - How Do I Know (Original Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf14yrb7WqM)**

Andrew Rayel is no stranger to top tunes in 2012. From ""Aeons of Revenge"" to ""550 Senta,"" he's been on numerous tracks and remix duties this year.  But perhaps the larger surprise was this more recently released tune, a vocal that could even upset the mighty Armin and Ana dominance: ""How Do I Know"" with Jano on vocals.  Featured as the intro to UR6, this was released on Armind (Armada) October 29th, 2012.  Here's what Armada had to say:

&gt;""Success comes at a fast pace for Moldavian producer Andrew Rayel. His tracks and remix are on fire, causing a stir around dance land. With his new vocal sensation 'How Do I Know' ft. Jano featured on Armin van Buuren's 'Universal Religion Chapter 6', future's looking brighter than ever.
Bursting onto the scene in 2010, Andrew Rayel has awakened the trance fires ones again. Through melodic jewels such as 'Exponential', 'Drapchi', '550 Senta' and 'Source Code', as well as remixes for W&amp;W, Roger Shah and many others, he's grown into one of the most promising names in trance.
That status will once more be confirmed, through the mesmerizing sounds of 'How Do I Know'. Setting forth a pair of warm, flawless vocals by Janette Hoogstraten, better known as Jano, it is set to become the crowd's favourite for many magical moments to come.

#And now your number 1 song….

## #1

10 million YouTube views.  Remixes by John O'Callaghan that perhaps arguably surpassed the original.  A track following in the footsteps of the catchy ""Tokyo.""  A superb vocalist.  A track some claimed was a hark back to the ""old days"" of trance.  All at the hands of a superb DJ and Producer.  You know what the song is by now.  This is it, your top track of 2012:

**[Gareth Emery featuring Christina Novelli - Concrete Angel (Original Mix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dFz10R529g)**

Honestly, there's not much else to be said about this track.  It received playtime on every station for months.  It was performed live countless times.  It's perhaps Gareth Emery's biggest track to date.  All released on a single from Garuda on February 13th, 2012.  Congratulations to Gareth Emery and Christina Novelli on producing this top track of 2012!

Stay tuned for details!

---

I don't necessarily mean Armin Van Buuren (that might be unlikely, but hell, one can hope right?), but if we could get Ernesto Vs Bastian for example to come on and do an IAmA right here on /r/trance, perhaps?

I'd like to know how many of you have something you'd want to ask them (or any other big artist).  Go ahead and post your thoughts!

**PLEASE NOTE:** I'm **not making any promises!**  Don't get your hopes up!  If there's enough support for this, we'll see what we can do :)

**Edit:** Wow, can't say I wasn't expecting it, but looks like the support is there, and looks like you guys are gonna have some good quality questions.  I will do my best, guys.  Let's see how it goes!

**Edit 2:** Okay, after much deliberation (and feedback from you guys!), I'm thinking perhaps the best place to host the actual IAmA post would be in the IAmA subreddit, rather than x-posting it to there, as the mods who run it might not like us submitting an x-post there.  Instead, I may x-post it from there to here, and simply leave an informative comment on the original post thread letting people know that /r/trance exists and is fairly cool if they're into trance.  That should prevent any potential issues with that.  I think.  I will message one of the mods of IAmA and ask about this anyway :)",,False,self,t5_2qi03,True,,au,True,t3_g6joc,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/g6joc/how_would_you_feel_about_an_iama_from_a_big_name/,moderator

Thank you to those who stopped by during the live broadcast.  Please see tracklist and download links for each set below.  If you happen to know an ID, or have a correction to suggest for the tracklist, please let me know! Thanks in advance!

EDIT2: Streaming Links Added courtesy of u/DJSlipStream.  Still working on Mat Zo's and Jody Wisternoff's track lists. I'm 100% confident on Above &amp;amp; Beyond's and Norin &amp;amp; Rad's, being that they tweeted them during their show.  I'm 99.9% confident on Andrew Bayer's; I'm assuming the first track and the next to last track are his creations (similar sounds), and would bet that the closing track was his as well.  

Mat Zo did a ton of mashups in his set, so still trying to work through them.  Jody played a lot of deep house tracks.  Most of these are probably going to be ID - ID for now, as I'm sure he showed off a few tracks on the upcoming Anjunadeep 05.

Avram Goldstein (1980) carried out a survey of 45 employees of a research center unconnected to music. Achieving a 100% return rate, 21 (47%) reported never having experienced a music-induced “thrill.” Similarly, Grewe et al. (2007) found that only 21 of 38 participants (55%) reported music-induced “chills.” After careful pretesting of stimulus materials, Konenči et al. (2007) were able to reliably induce 
“thrills” in only 35% of an undergraduate student sample. By contrast, 90% of the music students included in Goldstein's study reported having experienced music-induced “thrills.” **It appears that only about half of the general population may be familiar with the experience.**

i think this is why myself and many others have fallen in love with trance. trance artists have perfected the art of inducing these chills with the breakdown, the buildup, then especially during the release. and i think its also why trance/electronic music gets a bad rap as being very repetitive and boring from those people that do not have the ability to experience musical frisson. and i feel very, very sorry for them.",,False,self,t5_2qi03,False,,,True,t3_f4t1w,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/f4t1w/you_know_the_chills_you_get_when_listening_to/,

A few pointers (to be edited):

* Nominate as many tracks as you feel are your favorites from the year and people will vote if they agree. I'll start with my favorites.

* I'd say anything that has been released via traditional trance channels (trance-oriented- labels, podcasts/radio shows, and DJ sets) is fair game, regardless if they are somewhat genre-benders, however in the end upvotes will decide. Example: BT/Adam K - Tomahawk, Gareth Emery - Tokyo, etc

* Make sure the track was actually released this year and not last year or earlier by searching for the track on [beatport](http://www.beatport.com/) and sorting by ascending date.",,False,self,t5_2qi03,True,,,True,t3_n1eyp,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/n1eyp/top_trance_tracks_of_2011_as_voted_by_rtrance/,

First of all I want to welcome our new members for joining one of the largest trance communities on the internet, it's users like yourself that helps us grow and make trance an unforgettable experience. 

To our current members thank you all for contributing and advocating trance music and r/trance to the rest of the world.

I appreciate it, makes me feel good knowing that there is a strong fan base to one of my favourite genres.

We're growing at numbers that I had never seen before, the month of January we had the most visitors than any other month since the creation of r/trance. 

[Here is a graph of our traffic for your enjoyment](http://i.imgur.com/DL98J.png), as a community we get more than 40+ members a day. 

**What have we been doing:**  

Some things I would like others in this subreddit to continue respecting each other, the majority of the members on r/trance seem to be new to the genre and this is creating confusion on what is trance, there is an influx of Clubby house and Progressive house being posted, at first we would be deleting these posts then we decided to keep them and see if the users would educate each other on the matter. 

Not sure if that approach has worked that well but as any other subreddit that has grown above 5k it has its drawbacks. 

The number one thing for us moderators to do is to moderate and not to police, we're a neutral body that were selected by the members to keep the topic of the subreddit relevant to its subscribers. We're volunteers and our core purpose is checking reported links and spam, we can't stop people using swearwords nor can we stop people from posting tracks other than trance on a trance subreddit, but with your help we can decrease it and keep r/trance as relevant as possible.

**So what we're asking is please do these:**  

Read the side bar, we have a FAQ section and it usually answers the majority of the questions out there.    

If you're posting songs, please for the love of trance put the title in there with the year proffered. (The year is not enforced but it would be nice). If your title says ""OMG LISTEN TO THIS!!!"" You're most likely going to get downvotted by the members. You can add your opinion into the title or as a comment as long as you put in the name of the song with it should be good.   

Tag NSFW material.

Report any links that is spam and not relevant to r/trance.  

Memes/advice animans are not allowed here and they are removed as requested by the members.

**State of flair:**    

Thanks to thespecial1 we made the flairs automatic and controlled by the users, you no longer have to send us a message asking for what flag you want. A lot of people have asked why we have flags? Basically it was requested by the members.

Everything that you see here on r/trance is based on suggestion of the members or implemented by users like yourself.  

So if you have any suggestions on how to make r/trance better for the future, please let us know by sending the moderators a message and if the idea is good and has user support we'll do our best to implement it.

Your humble moderator,

Sassan

First of all I want to welcome all of you who have joined us recently to /r/trance. We're a very scattered group of people and can be found all around the world. The love of our trance got us together here. 

Please feel free to read our [frequently asked questions and answers](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/trance) and if you would like go ahead and edit it as well. 

Our method of moderating has been very hands off so far as the tranceit community is very good at self governing.

Also we are all friendly towards one another here so please no harsh words or criticisms of ones taste in a track or an artist. Please don't downvote a post just because you don't like others musical taste.

We want to encourage discussions about genre of trance in general [psytrance, prog trance, vocal etc..], mass downvoting has become a common problem recently so please don't downvote on the basis of not liking the artist or if you have already heard that track. 

Keep in mind any posts with direct mp3 or .rar or .zip with dumps of albums will be automatically removed, unless the artist of the work has granted sharing in this manner. Keep your posts relevant to trance music only. If you're a dj and want to share your latest work as long as it's trance then it's allowed here, the only other exception at this time is progressive house and chillout dreams. 

Please report spam and anything unrelated to the subreddit.  

Drop us a message if you think your post was caught by the spamfilter or any help, we're always willing to help and are always looking for members feedback on how to make this place the best trance community on the internet.

If you also would like to talk with the electronic community of reddit including tranceheads like yourself feel free to come to the irc channel and say hi. The information for the irc is on the sidebar.

Thank you again,

Your humble moderator

Sassan

**Update**: Seeing as how this post is being downvoted it seems that the message is not being well received. Please pm me if you are concerned about anything or leave a comment below. I have actually been given the role of mod since the early days of this subreddit by the community and to serve and better the community is my only concern.

1365438739.0,106,self.trance,1bxbwo,Getting into Trance for the first time. My friend made me this guide to start out. Any more advice? Agree? Disagree?,jdbender66,137,31,171,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/1bxbwo/getting_into_trance_for_the_first_time_my_friend/,"Hello ___________,
It has come to my attention that you may or may not be FINALLY into the best possible music genre ever invented, **trance**.  While this may seem like a ""no big deal"" situation, or a ""I can handle this"" moment, I am here to tell you that you are dead wrong. Trance is like mining for gold or diamonds, there is going to be shit flying everywhere. It is my duty to guide you through this perilous journey in hopes that you might truly come to respect the music as I do.

First, from a music producer's standpoint, when I listen to trance I want to put a bullet into my brain. How do they make those sounds? We will never know. This is because the typical trance production has about 5 times as many tracks as the typical skrillex wub. The sound designing that goes into it is way fucking beyond any normal persons comprehension of anything.  Why do you think I have never tried to make something as such? Because I suck at it and always will (just like 99% of the population on this earth).  Unless you want to sound like DJBA (*this was an kid who made awful electronic music at our high school, I recommend you substitute in ""Avicii""*) in all aspects, don't try it.

http://techno.org/electronic-music-guide/

First step, go to this website and look at the trance section. Try and get a grasp of where all of this craziness came from. Know that everything from dance dance revolution synthpop to hardstyle rave-in-your-face all spawned from the same movement. Honestly, I have spent hours on this website, eat your heart out.

**Second step: CLASSIC ALBUMS-**

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagine_(Armin_van_Buuren_album)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-State_(album)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunny_Tales

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirens_of_the_Sea_(album)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Fade_Away

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_%26_Dresden_(album)

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europop_(album)

http://www.allmusic.com/album/universal-religion-2008-mw0000751314

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addicted_to_Music


These are just some of the flipping CLASSIC albums that are out there. My number ones are probably Europop and Imagine.  These showcase the raw trance musical form, while keeping things bumpin. If at any point you are listening to any of these albums and a thought comes to mind like, ""Wtf am I listening to......this sucks"", you are more than likely not high enough and clearly not thinking straight.

**Third Step: CLASSIC JAMS-**

Anhken - Green Line (Original Mix)

Above &amp; Beyond - Good For Me

Aly &amp; Fila - Listening (Philippe El Sisi Remix)

Mike Shiver feat. Aruna - Everywhere You Are (Duderstadt Remix)

Dash Berlin - Never Cry Again (Jorn Van Deynhoven Remix)

Dash Berlin - Till The Sky Falls Down

First State - Cross The Line (Extended Remix)

Flanders - Behind (EDX Remix)

Fragma - Toca's Miracle

Gabriel and Dresden - Tracking Treasure Down

George Acosta feat. Fisher - Tearing Me Apart (DNS Project Remix)

Giuseppe Ottaviani - Angel (Club Mix)

John 'O Callaghan - Big Sky (Agnelli &amp; Nelson Remix)

Lange - Live Forever (Mat Zo Remix)

Marcus Schossow &amp; Reeves feat. Emma Hewitt - Light (Mike Shivers Garden State Remix)

Matt Darey pres. Urban Astronauts - See The Sun (Aurosonic Remix)

Nitrous Oxide feat. Aneym - Far Away (Club Mix)

Sunlounger feat. Zara - Lost (Club Mix)

Super 8 &amp; Tab - Black Is The New Yellow

Vast Vision feat. Fisher - Everything (Aly &amp; Fila Remix)

Yuri Kane - Right Back (Original Mix)

4 Strings feat. Ellie Lawson - Safe From Harm

Mat Zo - The Fractal Universe (Original Mix)


**Fourth Step: CLASSIC CATEGORIES-**

Ok, in this section I will try and distinguish between the different ""genres"" of trance that are out there.
Here is a quick list, then I will go into more detail.

Vocal Trance

Uplifting Trance

Hard Trance

Trouse (Trance-House)

Progressive Trance

Euro-Trance

Tech-Trance

Goa Trance

Psychedelic Trance

Acid Trance


Now the easiest way for me to explain genres is by pairing an artist with them who has that sound.

Aly &amp; Fila - Always have a harder and faster sound to them. Big bassdrums and loud melodies. Trade-mark sound is the sub drop (beeewwwwwwmmmmmm)

Armin Van Buuren - Progressive and vocal trance. Armin is a staple of the genre, has made songs all across the board but tends to stick to a more classic progressive sound.

Dash Berlin - Uplifting style. Crazy pads and pianos to make you feel like you are in heaven

John 'O Callaghan - Vocal trance! This is the man with the plan. Great vocals, lyrics, and accompaniment.

First State - Hard trance sound with classic form, always have drop-out breakdowns with bass-in-your-face.



**Fifth Step: CLASSIC VOCALISTS-**

If at any time you see a song with any of the listed vocalists, I highly recommend checking it out.

Emma Hewitt

Aruna

Emma Lock

Aneym

Fisher

Zoe Johnston

Andain

Cristina Soto

Jaren

Zara Taylor

Sarah Howells

Audrey Gallagher

Susana

Ellie Lawson



**CONCLUSION**

The other day you were reading the Ultra lineup to me.....""like, Pretty Lights isn't even a headliner!!!!""
Yes, and do you know why? Because trance is the best type of music in the world. It has the power to make you feel any emotion at any one moment.  Why do you think artists like Above &amp; Beyond have been around since the dawn of time? Now you might be saying, ""Why does nobody talk about it?"" This is because everyone knows the unspoken truth. There is no need to argue, or justify anything because it is simply fact. Trance is the best. Trance fans are widespread and very present, they listen to radio shows and attend concerts that nobody else usually are at or even think about.  In my opinion, the United States is still in its ignorant stages and everyone knows that because NO TRANCE ARTISTS EVER COME CLOSE.  They play Ultra and get the fuck out because nobody here listens to them.  It's quite unfortunate actually, that I will have to travel over seas to see the artists I love.....but it is a price I will have to pay. Now I set you off on your journey......I only hope I have given the tools and guidance necessary to make it a successful one.

https://www.facebook.com/notes/max-graham/why-are-songs-titled-as-id/10151178583559075


&gt; If you see ID next to a track name it can be frustrating as you may want to purchase that track and support that artist. There are actually a few reasons why a DJ chooses not to reveal the name of a track. 
&gt; 
&gt;1. **Host is testing out their own material and ideas.** Sometimes i might play a track i've made that i'm not sure i'm even going to release. I may just want to see if there's any reaction on twitter. If there isn't much i may decide to completely scrap it and start over, or use a part of it for a future remix... If the host identifies it as one of their songs it get's ripped to youtube and becomes a topic of discussion ""why didn't you release it?"" ""why did you change it so much"" ""why did you use part of your own track for a remix of that other track"" and so on... keeping it ID reduces those questions and keeps things simple. 
&gt; 
&gt;2. **DJ is not supposed to have the record.** In some cases a track has been promised to another A-list DJ for a compilation exclusively, this means the dj will want to keep it very secret to keep it a suprise of the CD tracklist release. If he/she finds out the song is being played by another dj on a radio shows he/she may not choose it for the CD compilation in favour of something that has yet to be played by anyone. By playing it as ID the dj can hide the fact that the track is being played, this also shows respect for the DJ who is paying for it to be on his CD and allows him/her to be the one to announce the name, this keeps his radio audience happy with fresh new tunes and the DJ making the compilation still uses it for his tracklist. Win/Win.
&gt; 
&gt;3. **Track is not signed.** If i get a track that i'm trying to sign i of course want to beat other labels to signing it, so while i might also test it out on the show i don't want to advertise what it is as other labels may swoop in and sign the record from under me. ID solves this.
&gt; 
&gt;4. **Artist has a song out at the same time.** A lot of artists/labels don't want people to feel like the song they are buying is not the latest one. If i play a record by an artists and tracklist it, but that artist has just released a track the same week, people naturally feel like the track they just bought is no longer the newest and they may choose to wait for the next. The focus on the single that's out is sometimes lost if there's other singles by the artist floating around. ID solves this.
&gt; 
&gt;5. **Spare the producer being put on the spot.** if i hear something by for example Myon and Shane54 on ASOT that i've never heard you can bet i'm emailing them right away. If it's listed as ID then i'm not, this spares them the hassle of having to say no to 30 people for a track they've promised exclusively for an upcoming compilation CD for example and simply can't give out. ID solves this
&gt; 
&gt;6. **Building Hype.** Sometimes the artist/label want to build some hype by getting people talking about a track without knowing who made it. The anticipation and speculation can help hype up a song before it's released. 
&gt; 
&gt;With google alerts being so on point it's impossible to hide anything once you type it on the internet. 
&gt; 
&gt;If it's out or available i will absolutely post it everywhere i can. As i've shown by being one of the only shows to provide easy access to tracks i play. By taking the extra time to search/cut/paste buy links into my tracklist i'm clearly on the side of promoting the artists rather than keeping things to myself. I'm also trusted by the artist with songs i shouldn't have for whatever reason, some are for ""live play only"" and i totally respect that (trust again) and when allowed to play them on the radio i would rather bring them to my audience untitled than not play them at all, isn't that the best way?... or i could just wait till they are finished or that other dj's compilation is out...

 I added style, in my personal opinion, so that people can decifer and understand subgenres a bit better.. (Might not be completely accurate) 

Sub Pts is the amount of points the track got as a link to /r/trance, not in the comments, just thought it would be interesting.

So I get into these moments -especially when listening to something even a bit old- like there's so much trance out there but there's so little time, not so much just to listen to but to maintain a library with all the good songs out there and that if you don't grab  a song then it becomes lost from you forever once you forget it.

Like today, I listened to 'Mindcircus' by Way Out West and then 'As The Rush Comes' and looked up JES in Wikipedia and remembered 'Everything' and 'High Glow' and then 'Imagination'  and feel like I lose some songs that slip through and are forgotten and never remembered.  Makes me sad..

Like Solee - Impressed (tried to think of a random song as an example) small lesser-known producer and if I didn't remember then I wouldn't hear that sweet sweet smooth bass.  I only heard the song through a friend as we were driving in his car and very likely could have never heard it to begin with.

Which brings up another reason for me to feel this way.  Finding good songs, impossible to hear all the good stuff you would like so guaranteed there's songs that you would love but haven't and wont hear ever.

This makes listening to anything not new bittersweet because I know there's great sounds I'm missing out on on a ratio of to what I do listen to.  Just wondering if anyone feels the same

As I joined this subreddit couple of years a go we were only 200 members and it was and is still to this day a quality subreddit because of what you make of it. 

We didn't have any mods back then, and I was voted into this role. Everything that you see on trancit has been implemented due to a suggestion that the majority agreed on, and that's how this subreddit will stay and us moderators will make sure of that. 

The future of this subreddit is in the hands of every one of you, since it's decided by the community of the direction that it wants to partake in.

Also I want to welcome our new members who joined us recently, I hope you like it here :)

Your friendly moderator,

I remember that I used to load up my external with days worth of ASOT / TATW (never know when you will need to pull out a specific episode)! My brother would then take all that and put it on his computer - along with all sorts of other music that I had on there, and would come back to me asking if I had heard ______ track yet, and we'd go into conversation about how awesome or weird it was. I've always been big into checking out artists when they came into town, but my brother couldn't, as he wasn't 18 yet. So I'd head off to shows and tell him all about it the next day. He'd go on about how we needed to go rage when he turned 18, and I was all for it.

Unfortunately, right before his 18th birthday, he took his life. Trance has always been known for being full of emotion, but its all had a different meaning to me since that. Whenever I go out and see whoever, I get far more emotional than I used to. I'm not bawling on the dance floor or anything like that, but the emotional themes in tracks seem to hit a lot closer to home.

Generally nobody knows what I'm talking about when I say things like that, but I know that you folks in the Trance community can tell what I'm talking about. So I just wanted to give you all a thank you for a kind of mutual understanding of what trance music is all about. 

So thank you Trance Family. I know that Drew would have fit in just fine.

I'm sure I've missed a lot, so please add them in the comment and I will add them here. Just make sure they are from 1990-2001 only.

If I can't find a stream for it on youtube I have it linked to grooveshark.

The list is in no particular order. Eventually once I get more time I would put the years next to them.

Enjoy :)

But while at the show I began to notice that many people are getting into edm for all the wrong reasons, like me and my friends were at this show to listen to A&amp;B's amazing music and to feel the love that these guys just generate. But while we were there for the music many people that were at the club were just there to either get super drunk and obnoxious, or were doing shit like cocaine. What the fuck is going on guys? What happened here? I mean the majority of the people didn't even know who A&amp;B was. Like when the opening act went off and A&amp;B came out people everywhere were going wait what that wasn't Above &amp; Beyond -_- I dunno, the show they put on was awesome, the music was awesome, everything about it was awesome, except for the people there. I dunno what's happening to people, it's like going from people being there for the music and appreciating how beautiful edm can be to just bros and hoes getting fucked up :/ I dunno, just thought I would share and would like to get anyone else's opinion who may have happened to have been at the opera when they played the other day",,False,self,t5_2qi03,False,,,True,t3_ulole,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/ulole/very_sad_at_an_above_beyond_show/,

This whole time Armin is running the ASOT radio show but Markus's set was cut off. So what do they do? Armin and Markus begin a KILLER back-to-back live set in the little booth behind the ASOT stage.

They even downloaded Darude's Sandstorm to play :)

Your autistic sibling runs up to you clutching a present that looks like it was wrapped by Michael J Fox. It's your family member so it's easily forgiven, amirite? Anyway, you open the present and it looks like [this](/http://i.imgur.com/SujHX.jpg). Now imagine that drawing is my mix. That's what you should expect. I don't have access to the bajillion acapellas that Myon &amp; Shane do nor do I feel like creating synthapellas and beatpellas. I also didn't want to spend more than a few hours on this. Keep that in mind, you judgmental pricks.

LOL I almost forgot, it says top 50 right? Well, I forgot to include Mat Zo &amp; Arty - Rebound because I'm a dumbass. There are 50 tracks though since I repeated one...care to guess which one that would be?

The other 6 (there are 53 tracks total) I selected were some of my favorites this year such as KhoMha - Mind Gamer, Markus Schulz - Soul Seeking, Omnia - Infina, Protoculture - Cobalt, Ben Gold - Where Life Takes Us, and a random Lee Osborne - Yachtmaster.

1367722888.0,86,self.trance,1dpp8h,"Thoughts of Armin's New Album After Seeing Him at His Intense Album Tour Debut at the Palladium, Los Angeles, CA",BRENTON8907,106,20,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/1dpp8h/thoughts_of_armins_new_album_after_seeing_him_at/,"Hey r/trance,

Last night I attended Armin’s Intense album tour debut at the Palladium in Los Angeles, CA.  I have been an avid trance listener for the last five years (so somewhat recent in comparison to some of you), but I have been to countless shows including seeing Armin now for the fifth time.

When I first heard the album, I was slightly disappointed.  It’s hard to describe why exactly, but it was like I felt it wasn’t the same type of legendary step that Imagine was.  Regardless, I bought tickets to the show because you would have to be insane to live in Los Angeles and not go!  I had high expectations because he is the number #1 DJ in the world and his previous shows have always been sets to remember.

Now in terms of the concert, Antillas opened from 9 PM to 12 AM and Armin went from 12 AM to 4 AM.  In terms of Antillas set, he played a wide mix of music, but a lot of it I identified as songs that were on the Beatport Trance Top 20 throughout the last year.  Not saying that in a negative way or anything, I am just trying to say that I was able to identify what songs he was playing quite easily.  Regardless, I had a blast during his set.

But in terms of Armin, he played one of the most amazing sets I have ever seen.  As I sift through the thousands of dollars I have spent going to club events (incl. Aly &amp; Fila, Cosmic Gate, Tiesto, Gareth Emery, etc.), massives (EDC 3 years, Escape from Wonderland, Beyond Wonderland, Together As One, etc.), and shows (incl. Above &amp; Beyond, Infected Mushroom, Axwell, Ferry Corsten, Lange, etc.), I cannot think of one set that compares to this (closest is probably Above &amp; Beyond at The Shrine in Los Angeles, CA).  In terms of the set, it was quite obvious why he was the number 1 DJ in terms of show production.

* I would say 1 in every 4-5 songs had a specially crafted video.  Including many songs that would have a cinematic entrance which pumped the crowd up (e.g., a short 30 second typography video asking the crowd if “They Are Afraid of 138"").

* Singers, Trevor Guthrie, Emma Hewitt, Aruna, Lauren Evans, Lauren Jansen, and Cindy Alma, sang songs from the Intense album and some of their other hits.

* Personally I think his mash-ups are amazing.  It’s great that through his mash-ups he can use lyrics from his older classics and layer them onto a newly released track (one that only a subset of the crowd has heard), adding a level of surprise to a long-time classic.

Now back to my thoughts on the album after seeing this set.  It made sense.  A lot of these tracks felt cookie-cutter at first, but after hearing it live and seeing/experiencing how the crowd reacts to the songs I now see how they all serve a purpose and why these were the songs constructed for this 2-year in the making album.

* He opened with Intense and a video constructed just for the song (features two violinists playing against one another, really cooler than how I am describing it now).  After this performance it became one of my newest favorite songs; it opened the show with so much energy and it really gave the crowd the level of energy the entire set would be.  Of course, Armin eventually tells the crowd that the set will live up to the album’s name “Intense.”

* I definitely did not understand This Is What It Feels Like when I first saw the preview video months ago.  But after seeing it live (W&amp;W remix), it made sense being placed in his set and why it was included in the album.  It is a vocal song that the crowd all joined in to sing.  A nice short passionate progressive house break where everyone joins in on, during an unbelievably well-constructed 4-hour trance mix.

* When I first listened to the album and heard Sound of the Drums I was expecting more.  But once I heard it live, I totally changed my mind.  Everyone in the crowd was going insane for the build-up and lost it at the break.  It pumped everyone up, and it kept the energy level high.  And I could continue going on about other songs, but I’m sure you get what I’m saying.

Might be rambling, but last night served as a reminder as to why he is the number 1 DJ in the world right now.  It might not be the pure trance of shows of 15 years ago, nor is it the trance sets of 6 years ago, the type of show is changing.  In my opinion, the longer trance sets of today still have a back-bone of trance music, but the DJs are now adding in a wider mix of music (including progressive house and trouse) and the best DJs make it more of a cinematic experience than just a pure-trance-music/dance inspired event.  It felt as if Armin wrote a movie for us to dance to, especially when you consider how he had numerous live singers and dozens of specially crafted videos.

If you have the chance to see him for his Intense album tour, I HIGHLY recommend you go.  And I hope you get to see him during a longer set; getting to see him for a 4-hour set was amazing, because he wasn’t rushed to play all his songs from his album.

Anyone else see Armin last night?  Did it affect your thoughts of the new album?

There's a lot of weird crossover music that's coming out nowadays that can fit in a lot of camps.

And so I plan on creating this series that'll hope to provide a basic style guide as to how tracks fit into their various subgenres, and how to identify them. It also serves as a look through the history of the subgenre, as I've ordered tracks by their release dates, so you can see how the genre has evolved over time.

It's not all encompassing, but there should be enough examples that you get the gist of what the subgenre is all about.

Anywho, [here's the first one I've done for Tech Trance](http://beatexplorers.com/trance/tech-trance-style-guide). 

My apologies if it goes a little slow or is a bit buggy, javascript is not my strong suit. Also, loading this many youtube videos doesn't seem wholly ideal, but it's the best solution I could come up with. 

If anyone has any suggestions or wants to assist for future subgenres, feel free to get in touch.

Was mainly looking forward to seeing CG (have seen Porter several times before, kid's whatever, meh) and was SO SO vastly excited to see Cosmic Gate and then they were somehow beyond upsettingly weak. 

 Porter ended his set at about 2 am (and his set was pretty fun, I won't hate, I had a good time dancing around) and then Cosmic Gate hopped back on after Porter closed out and I immediately thought ""yes, CG is back, now i'm gonna get some beautiful awesome uninterrupted serious mega trance for a few hours..."" nope. Just. Might as well have been Nicky Romero or Hardwell up on the decks. They played the most generic indistinguishable electro fucking four on the floor poppy house that i've ever heard. As I said - might as well have been Nicky Romero. 

I actually don't mean to hate. I don't. I like trance that is new and I love desperately many tracks that are old. Frankly, this sub has opened my eyes to a lot of great things in the genre -- new and old (kudos to all of you for having great taste and being thoughtful). But. Goddammit. I went to see Cosmic Gate to see Cosmic fucking Gate, and I don't think I've ever been so disappointed. 

The only ""trance"" they played was The goddamn Fusion. 

Can somebody please commiserate here with me about why this is happening. Because I don't want this to continue to be a trend. I'm especially shocked because it was COSMIC GATE....not like, Tritonal.

They weren't very good. I didn't have huge expectations for their live set, but given the amount that I typically enjoy their productions and album I was looking forward to hearing them mix live. I've outlined some of my issues below.

The mixing was garbage. There were actually two different train wrecks, most tracks were completely clashing in key and in general I often felt lack of flow between tracks at all.

Chad was way too nuts. Not to be snobby, but I feel that being a DJ AND getting on a microphone is kind of a faux pas. I was annoyed about the 3rd or 4th time he said, ""get your fucking hands in the fucking air and make some fucking noise"" or something to that extent. And then he would come out on stage and stage jumping around and dancing around and knocking over people's drinks. I couldn't help but think of the moment in Anchorman when Will Ferrell leaves the stage to step on people's tables and smash their drinks, that's kind of what it felt like when Chad was running around the stage kicking off beer bottles and spilling glasses.

Track selection was static. I didn't dislike the tracks they chose. And I would try to never hold that alone against a DJ act but seriously, there was no up and down to the set. They just played banger after banger after banger. Even when the audience seemed tired to me, they would just throw on another banger. It just felt as though they were so disconnected from the actual audience.

Maybe I'm just too pretentious. I had a good time, but seeing their live act left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",,False,self,t5_2qi03,False,,us,True,t3_13tdst,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/13tdst/so_i_saw_tritonal_for_the_first_time/,

Since posting all the links here would be to long and they won't even fit due to char limits, I'm just gonna post the link to the urtrancezone forums. Some of them are not available in Canada (probably U.S. also), and some are already down. There are at least 3 link working for each set and I believe that rapidshare and zippyshare links can be accessed by everyone.

01. http://www.urtrancezone.com/asot/armin-van-buuren-a-state-of-trance-550-t45650-435.html
02. http://weloveatrance.com/

The A State Of Blue rips are in 256 kbps (taken from DI.fm stream), while other sets are ripped from the asot live feed and are at 128 kbps. (I'm pretty sure higher quality links will be up in the near future, all the streams had the same sound quality iirc).

I've added the weloveatrance.com link for higher quality downloads for the rest of the sets. Given the size of the files, they should be 256 kbps.

I already posted the partial tracklists below. I'll update my posts as soon as the rest of the sets are IDed, but it will take a bit of time for people to have a listen and ID each and every track there is left.

Also, quite a few people asked what where the best sets of the night. If you enjoy the electro/trouse type of sets, you won't find a lot of them in Den Bosch unfortunately. Almost all the sets were high energy trance music, so the fans of uplifting will rejoice. 

I highly recommend the following sets from what I had the chance to hear and what others have recommended on the di.fm forums:

A State Of Blue

01. Armin van Buuren warmup
02. Gabriel &amp; Dresden 
03. Aly &amp; Fila
04. John O'Callaghan

A State Of Green

01. Orjan Nilsen
02. Markus Schulz
03. Armin van Buuren (classics)
04. Giuseppe Ottaviani

A State Of Yellow

01. Matt Darey
02. Protoculture
03. Jorn van Deynhoven
04. Ronski Speed

A State Of Pink

01. Sophie Sugar
02. Claudia Cazacu
03. Lisa Lashes

A State Of Red

01. Sebastian Brandt
02. DNS Project

Set of the night is a toss-up b/w Armin's classic set and Sebastian Brandt's set on the RED stage.

I didn't mention Armin's set from A State Of Blue simply because it was a mix of tunes he already played in his previous sets at ASOT 550 events combined with tunes from ASOT 554. The set itself is good/great, but I already heard the tracks a few times in the past weeks. I prefer to hear an original set instead.

UPDATE:

I have updated the tracklists with all the sets that have been IDed so far. I finally managed to get all the sets downloaded so I'll start to listen to them and ID what I can.

Many of you who listen to trance radio shows will be familiar with the whole 'track/record/tune of the week' concept so I thought it would be cool if r/trance could vote on a track of the week. We could do both pro tracks but also a side one for r/trance producers. This way we would be showing users the latest and best (in our opinion) trance tracks but also supporting any producers. 

I've always felt reddit should have a poll feature of some sort and I'm not to sure how any of what I have said would work but I think it would be cool. So feel free to suggest ideas for how this could work, or wouldn't?

In case you haven't noticed we have a new logo and a new header.  

I wanted to thank, [Zombiebenji](http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/h9cfo/wanna_help_design_the_new_look_of_tranceit/c1ttp2h) for creating the awesome new reddit alien who had gotten the highest upvotes in our logo competition.  

I also want to thank my brother [ehsany](http://www.reddit.com/user/ehsany) for editing the alien and finding a header and a font to go along with everything. 

And last the awesome hclpfan who helped out with editing of the code and also editing further on the design. Check out his music website called [pulseblend](http://www.pulseblend.com/) :)

I have heard many good suggestion, but I can't make everyone happy at the moment. At least we have a kickass header and alien that looks better than anything /r/trance had before. 

Once again thank you all for your feedbacks and helping out with the design. 

Keep on trancing,

Sassan

First off I want to introduce myself. My name is Elias and I live in Washington DC. Recently I have helped start a trance-only night at Lima Lounge. The best part of this is that it is co-sponsored by Euphonic Records and United States Trance Movement. For the month of January, we already have Kyau &amp; Albert, Grube &amp; Hovsepian &amp; Lange. And in the coming months, we have Ronski Speed, Stoneface &amp; Terminal, Menno de Jong, Myon &amp; Shane 54, Mark Eteson and many more. I am reaching out to you guys today to see if anyone wants to help me out with promotions, etc. I can guarantee free entry to every show and you'll most definitely get to meet the talent. If you live in the DMV (DC, Maryland, Virginia) please PM me for more information. If you just want to come to the shows and get free entry, also PM me. In the coming weeks, I will be posting links to these various events. 

You guys know that I am active in this subreddit, so this is not a ZOMG #TRANCEFAMILY 4 LIFE post. I am reaching out to you guys because I trust your opinions and I know you guys know good trance music. 

For those of you have facebook, please head over to this [link](https://www.facebook.com/pages/TranceFamily-DC/213624328653406?bookmark_t=page) and like it. It would be greatly appreciated. For those who do not have facebook and would still like to contribute, PM me. 

Best,

1328227143.0,69,self.trance,p8h2m,Trance vs. House,inikul,75,6,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/p8h2m/trance_vs_house/,"I made this in response to the 11k milestone post.  It was mentioned that a lot of people don't recognize the differences between trance and house music.  I hope to make it clearer with this post.  This is mostly for sub-genres that are more similar to trance.  Hopefully you wouldn't mistake psytrance for house or electro house for trance.

Both genres (this is part of what can lead to confusion):

* Usually a bass kick on each beat.

* Instruments are generally added or taken away every 4 or 8 bars.

* 120-150 BPM.  Trance tends to be faster.  Psytrance and hard trance sometimes push past 145 BPM.

Trance:

* Synthesizers are used heavily. There can be multiple layers of synth rhythms going on at once, giving depth to the song.

* A ""synth lead"" is often used for the main hook of the song. Sometimes used in house (especially electro), but I see it far more in trance.

* [Arpeggios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio) are common.

* Reverb and delay.  It's the echo effect you hear, especially on voices and synth leads.

* Buildups and breakdowns are important features of the song structure.  This is usually not true for most house songs.  This doesn't mean they are nonexistent, but often less pronounced.

* Side chaining and gated synths.  Used quite often in trance and not so much in other genres.  These are used to ""cut out"" the volume on parts of a note or voice, creating a rhythm.  It is hard for me to explain, so just listen to this [gated synth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DICsh7JtTtI&amp;t=2m48s).

* Trance focuses more on building a melody, whereas house focuses on the beat.

Look for any of these characteristics if you are having troubles figuring out if it is trance.  Over time, you can just kind of tell when it is.  If all else fails, look up the genre on a site like discogs.

Trance genre examples:

* [Progressive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FD0UmSHltU)

* [Uplifting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hIccvKscAc)

* [Goa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYnTykSgDwk)/[Psy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlRLzKDjX1I)/[Prog Psy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q79bvoNrGt8)

* [Hard](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-RrW50KD7M)

* [Tech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dybBj8awBXM)

* [Acid](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPlX0R4O1b8)

* Vocal - you can figure it out

House genre examples (besides electro and progressive, I'm not that great at IDing house genres):

* [Progressive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqHFHuCkono), [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK1mLIeXwsQ)

* [Electro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXoXMjUGHMg)

* [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ovdm2yX4MA) is the clubby stuff that people get confused sometimes. It is more focused on the beat and not a melody.  Once you get the feel for both genres, you can easily tell that it isn't trance.

**tl;dr** - The easiest way for me to explain it is trance has more of a ""flow"" to it.  Trance's structure focuses on buildups, breakdowns, and melodies.  It has a sort of rolling or pulsing feeling to the beat that house does not.

**Note**:  I used words like ""usually"" and ""often"" throughout because these aren't always true.  Any producers out there or people who feel they know trance better, chime in with additions or changes.",,False,self,t5_2qi03,1366917574.0,,us,True,t3_p8h2m,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/p8h2m/trance_vs_house/,

I honestly thought Above &amp; Beyond could have taken it this year. They had an absolutely phenomenal year. I think they were robbed. 

I cant believe David Guetta is at the top. To me, he is a glorified rap producer and does not deserve to be near Armin or Tiesto. Yeah the music Armin and Tiesto make these days is iffy, but back in the day they were monster trance djs. David Guetta? Yeah he's always made that same trash.

""Welcome to Cycles Radio, my name is Max Graham and I like to think of these next two hours as your weekly escape from the madness that is our dance music scene. Two hours of nothing but producers showing their love for the music, and nothing more. Guys like Khoma, Ummet Ozcan, Heatbeat, Stoneface and Terminal, Norin and Rad, Maor Levi, Keyworth, Oliver Lang, Steve Haines, guys like this who don't give a shit about TV commercials, endorsements, private jets. They really just want to be left alone in their studio to make the music that moves them, and hopefully get a chance to share it with the world.

I had obviously heard stuff from that time but I wanted to fully immerse myself in the style. Educate myself.

So I came across some older ASOTs starting from 210 and now I'm up to 224 and *holy. fucking. shit* They're absolutely **AMAZING.** Like, where the hell have these been all my life?? It's like the literally put you in a state of trance.

They're like beautiful electronic symphonies, not so much DJ dance party sets. They're like beautiful stories, so diverse, so energetic, and so euphoric. Epic build ups, perfect breaks, fantastic fast basslines, no cheesy vocals, just purely amazing. I thought I would find a few good tunes from these to play in the gym or in my car but *the entire sets* are insanely mind melting.

I know people don't usually like when AvB gets constant attention and I totally agree, but after listening to these older tunes I just thought I had to share. I'm so excited to check out the rest of them.

EDIT: Most people here got into the music late 90's early 2000's.

1. Zyzz
2. Video Games
3. Radio shows (tatw &amp; asot for the recent addicts)

While I think AvB's new tracks are terrible, that's just my opinion on a lot of the modern scene in general.

In defense of Armin Van Buuren, *this* is why he's so big:

a) A State of Trance has over 30 million listeners. Through ASOT, he united trance listeners from every country and culture.

b) His early work is fucking legendary.

I don't want to make a huge thing about it (being we just celebrated 24K subscribers what seems to be just last week), but we're moving on up in the Reddit world with 25K subscribers strong!

First, I want to personally thank each and every one of you for making this subreddit what it is.  I'm extremely grateful to continue to be moderating such a superb and relatively drama-free subreddit (especially considering our size!).

That being said, since the only way we grow is by welcoming in new people (Hi!), I just wanted to take the time to refresh everyone on a few things:

###Refreshers:

1. First and foremost, welcome! If you ever have any questions, please feel free to message the moderators at any time.  We're here for this sub, trance music, and you!

2. Please make sure you read the rules on posting.  They're on the right sidebar in the very nifty black box.  This should hopefully answer most issues with why your post might be removed.  The largest issue we usually have is reposts (don't worry, we know reddit's search is meh).

3. Remember that this is a *Trance* subreddit.  I know sometimes Progressive House is hard to tell apart from Progressive Trance, but try using artist's tags, Beatport, Discogs, etc. as guides to help you determine where your song lies.  On that note, just a friendly reminder that artists explore: a trance artists can produce songs outside the trance realm, which can be great! But please try to find the appropriate subreddit for that song or link.

4. For new and older users, we do have a Wiki in place [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/wiki/index).  Here, you'll find our blacklisted tracks, Trance Labels, Past AMAs, a nice list of podcasts, and more!

5. Keep up to date with our weekly podcast or upcoming AMAs by checking our Announcements on the top right of the page (if you keep our CSS enabled of course!).

6. Finally, last but not least, I recommend everyone, regardless if you're a new user or been here 6+ years, to refresh yourselves on [Redditquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).  While it hasn't been as bad as other subs I visit, I have noticed a few issues in the past few months, especially with the Spring Season of large shows and Album Releases.  Mainly, **upvote posts and comments that contribute to the community and discussion *regardless* if you agree with the comment or not**.  I know we have the tendency to hit the downvote button automatically if someone criticizes our #1 artist, but that person's opinion is just as valid as your's.  And without diverse interests in our community, we can't sustain growth in all areas of trance.

Anyway, thank you again all for making this subreddit as it is today: [A Million Different Sounds, and Thousands of Smiles!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Porvc-rnHsA)

First of all I want to thank every single one of you that has contributed and made the amazing mixes and also want to thank those of you who gave feedback to your peers, [after 2 month of mixing and waiting](http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/qvkcx/rtrance_first_mix_competition_for_2012_you_decide/) it has finally come to an end.

It was difficult as many of you said, there were 19 competitors and all of these were great to listen to, they all followed the rules of one hour of uplifting trance in the range of 135-140 bpm. [Please check out these mixes as they all deserve a lot of recognition and praise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/qvkcx/rtrance_first_mix_competition_for_2012_you_decide/)

The person that accumulated the most votes from /r/trance members in our first 2012 mix competition is [Eatofo](http://soundcloud.com/brian-eatough/put-your-hands-up-for-reddit)! 

Congratulations eatofo,  looking forward on hearing more mixes from you and I hope to see more of your talent.

As promised eatofo will be given his spot on the sidebar for his mix so that everyone can listen to it for one month.

If you guys have any suggestions on how to make upcoming mix competitions better please leave a comment bellow and if it's possible I will implement it into our next competition.

Every /r/trance mix competition feeds from your feedback and improves.

I hope everyone had fun and for those of you who missed out don't worry will have another one soon.

Your humble moderator,

Sassan

I just wanted to share two online radios with you.
The first one is [**afterhours.fm**](http://www.ah.fm/player/) which isn't that popular and only has this one channel.

The second one is [**di.fm (digitally imported)**](http://www.di.fm/) which basically has channels for every electronic genre out there. 
For Trance, I recommend the [vocal trance](http://www.di.fm/vocaltrance) and [trance](http://www.di.fm/trance) channels.

There are more trance related channels like psy-trance and classic (vocal) trance on di.fm, but these don't really belong in this subreddit.

Both pages stream podcasts like ASOT, Corsten's Countdown, Magic Island etc. besides the regular single-track broadcasts.

I hope some of you people can make use of this. Happy listening!

1332175452.0,51,self.trance,r3mv7,A crash course on Fei-Fei (including links) and a personal rant on the ASOT550 debacle. ,wanderingsong,61,10,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/r3mv7/a_crash_course_on_feifei_including_links_and_a/,"Okay, I'm not gonna spam the subreddit with more links to Fei-Fei's older stuff (I posted Ender a day ago), so let me just throw all this out here at once:

**Fei-Fei has been on the EDM scene for a while. When I became aware of her in 2009, she was still a tech-trance artist and [fully backed by Armada](http://www.armadamusic.com/news/2009/07/2795/)** (interview link). Her Armada artist page has been taken down sometime since she went independent in 2010, but [here's an Armada Artist of the Week feature](http://www.armadamusic.com/news/2008/11/2191/).

- [Full Discogs entry](http://www.discogs.com/artist/Fei-Fei)
- [Synchronicity](http://www.discogs.com/Fei-Fei-Synchronicity/release/1744379), a 2008 mix/compilation CD she released on Armada Digital with [press release on Armada here](http://www.armadamusic.com/news/2008/10/2118/)
- She kicked off her own label, [Feided, in 2010](http://www.discogs.com/label/Feided); the majority of the releases are still trance-y and all were well-supported by radio shows &amp; DJs worldwide

Some of her best tracks, IMO:

- [Fei-Fei - Ender](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOLE2Vu6_ls) (2008) [Club Elite/Armada]
- [Fei-Fei - Everglow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttplPrzKON0) (2008) [Vandit]
- [JOOP - Pradera (Fei-Fei Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe8MDUCYSY4) (2009) [High Contrast]
- [Fei-Fei - Daksa (Reaky Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfayNdupBco) (2010) [Feided]

a) Fei-Fei is not a nobody who appeared out of nowhere.

b) Her image has always, ALWAYS been that of an EDM rebel. She played up being a lady making dirtier, technier trance back when the only other women on the scene were mostly making uplifting (Sophie Sugar, Claudia Cazacu, etc). An oft-cited quote is ""Fei-Fei is the bad girl of trance""-- spoken by none other than **Tiesto** on his Club Life show (back when both he &amp; she were still in trance, hahahahaha oh man that's funny).

I'm not saying it excuses her being rude during her interview, but honestly, I think she was being pre-emptively defensive. (and understandably so.) I'd rather her stay in-character/keep it consistent. It's getting painfully one-dimensional out there in trance.

c) Booking her was a clear strategic move on ASOT's part, and I feel like she was a guinea pig set up to take any possible flak.

Why do I say that? She was the first artist up that night. First. Artist. In. The Lineup. Artists at major festivals are very, very often organized by overall average BPM or playing style, and where the fuck else would you put a dubstep artist? **I'm pretty sure they knew what they were setting themselves up for.** 

I mean, I'm pretty sure they're also regretting it now, but given how Armada tries to cater to the mainstream more &amp; more these days, I'm also pretty sure they were testing the waters to see if they could have a slice of the dubstep bandwagon pie. If it went badly, well, the masses would turn on her, not them. (which they did.)

---

Which brings me to my personal rant. I used to be a pretty big Fei-Fei fan, starting with the first time I heard Ender, but her Daksa single was the last time I felt so strongly about her. I don't like dubstep. When I started to realize she was sliding toward dubstep in 2011, I got saaaaad. 

Why? There are very few women in trance. And of the women in trance, very few are energetic DJs who don't just sit behind the decks &amp; look like dolls. There are lots of obstacles to women in both industry &amp; fanbase alike. (95% of the trance vids on youtube have mostly-naked women with giant tits as the default pic. Not a great genre to get taken seriously in.) She never really played up her looks-- just the badass rebel image.

But I accepted it as her creative decision/personal choice. It didn't seem contrived. I just stopped listening to her podcasts/shows &amp; releases. A loss for trance, but life goes on.

When ASOT550 announced its A State of Pink ladies' stage (which, btw, I thought was unbearably gimmicky-- if you're gonna give ladies equal chances, put them on the same stage as the dudes), I was unsurprised to see Fei-Fei not on the lineup, but sad *again,* because I felt like it was a reaffirmation of her fall from grace, as it were. When I heard she was opening for ASOT550 LA, though, my reaction was kind of like ""what the fuck? this could either end well or...uh...""

Yeah, no.

The fallout has been rifuckingdiculous, and in the comments I've seen, the racial slurs &amp; sexism have been running rampant. Whoa whoa whoa! Loving, laid-back, euphoric trance scene my ass! You don't hear people calling Shogun by racial slurs because he stays in his happy little trance niche. You also don't hear people objectifying trance artists much-- wait, except for...listen to anyone talk about a vocalist (or Claudia Cazacu) and the convo inevitably turns to ""also, she's hot"" or ""but she's not hot :((((("" la di fucking daaaaah.

u mad, trance scene? 'cause I know I am. All the time. I'm one of those people who gets crotchety and annoyed about ""trouse"" and ""new trance"" and I don't like dubstep and etc etc etc but good fucking god, this reaction. I got mad when Tiesto went housey, I still get mad when I hear Ferry Corsten &amp; Markus Schulz doing mindblowingly terrible house tracks. I got mad when the likes of Gabriel &amp; Dresden and Gareth Emery and Armin started playing sets completely under 132 BPM-- 

but I didn't start slinging personal attacks left &amp; right. ('cept Tijs looks weird, and totally wears lip gloss. but I digress.)

I leave you with these tweets from DJ Eco, because they're rather apt:

""[I personally didn't like the set, but yikes, people should try to end war/hunger with the same energy they're using to tell people they suck](https://twitter.com/#!/DJ_Eco/status/181606777270439937)""
""[I'm not spewing the whole ""be open-minded"" crap but be mindful of the fact that someone you're telling to ""go kill yourself"" is human too](https://twitter.com/#!/DJ_Eco/status/181607808872095744)""

**tl;dr** Fei-Fei has always liked stirring up shit/being different. Dislike dubstep all you want, but I feel like all the warning signs were there if you looked for them, so move on with life and for FUCK'S SAKE ENOUGH WITH THE SHIT-SLINGING IN THE GODDAMN TRANCE SCENE",,False,self,t5_2qi03,True,,us,True,t3_r3mv7,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/r3mv7/a_crash_course_on_feifei_including_links_and_a/,

As you're all no doubt aware, we've been endeavouring to reel in AMAs from some international top trance artists.  Hopefully in the next little while, we should have some bites :) not going to reveal anything more on that yet as we don't want to count chickens before they hatch.

There is another thing that myself and Sassanix have been discussing.  We're thinking of putting together a monthly double set, mixed by us, entirely for you guys.  Each month we'll be putting together a set based on your suggestions and our picks for favourite new tunes.  We'd also like to use it as a platform to promote good trance artists who are also fellow Tranceit members that need some exposure.  So if you are a trance producer and believe you have some high quality trance to show the world, or you have a friend who is writing some floor-destroyers, let myself or Sassanix know about it and we will definitely check it out, and if it's good, we will play it in a show!  More details to come about this soon.  Stay tuned!

Tthe next few months looks set to be full of interesting things happening for /r/trance.  As we grow our community, we want to help you get the most out of it.  **You guys are the best (I mean that)!**

It was almost immediately downvoted out of sight for what another redditor claimed as potentially blog spam. The main reason I wrote the post was because people seemed to enjoy my previous one about Myon &amp; Shane 54. I spoke with a very nice mod who explained that my link was in fact not blog spam and who said it contributed a unique conversation to the sub. I understand that a lot of people no longer like Dash Berlin and that his sound is much more electro these days, but most of the songs I included pre-date 2011. I'm posting this as a self post with the text of my blog below because I do not give a fuck about karma and just want to share some of the music that got me into this genre we all love with people who may not have heard it yet. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.


**TL;DR: My blog got downvoted so here is a self post because I want to share good music and good vibes.**


I received a lot of Internet love for my post about [Myon &amp; Shane 54](http://edmozer.wordpress.com/2013/07/02/featured-artist-myon-shane-54/) yesterday, so I decided to feature my second favorite DJ Dash Berlin in today’s “Featured Artist” post.

It’s hard to even begin writing about Dash Berlin because of his huge impact on my taste in music, as well as my life in general. Just to get this out of the way, Dash Berlin is a group of three producers, but I am still unclear about whether they all still make music or if it is just one guy. Maybe someone can comment below and fill me in.

Anyway, my love affair with Dash Berlin began after the first time I heard “Man On The Run.” I can’t remember where I was or when I heard it, but let me tell you, this is the PERFECT Trance song. It pretty much set the tone for my interest in Trance and I have been hooked ever since. [“Man On The Run”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOq7RcjXtiA) is in contention for my favorite Trance song, which will eventually be decided in the post I have been waiting to write since I began blogging – my top 10 Trance songs of all-time. Also, you HAVE to listen to the nine minute version. You have to.

The thing that makes Dash the shit is that his music goes so hard at times, yet still pulls on your emotions with his beautiful breakdowns and angelic vocals. And there is no better case for this than “Man On The Run.” Other Trance producers implement a similar style, but Dash has his own unique, raw sound that I’ve never heard anyone replicate. Take for example any of his 4AM remixes. He takes incredibly beautiful songs in their own right and recreates them with his own darker spin. My favorite example of this is [“Not Giving Up On Love (Dash Berlin 4AM Remix).”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVySkpsADwI) Now I’m not the biggest Armin fan, but you can tell that the original was seriously missing something. So what does Dash do? He comes in and crushes it!

Another thing that I want to add to this conversation is my progression of Dash Berlin listening. After I fell in love with “Man On The Run,” I eagerly pursued his entire library. At the time, his two most popular songs were [“Waiting”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HUAR5FVuoM) and [“Till The Sky Falls Down,”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQzq5vQhA_U) however I became strangely attracted to the lesser-known [“Never Cry Again”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRCVTnp1x3Y) and [“The Night Time.”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYj_8_EEHJk) Anyone who went to college with me might remember me banging my head away at College Library while you were slaving away studying. If you do, there’s a good chance it was to one of those two songs because I was obsessed!

I’ve been fortunate enough to see Dash Berlin live twice. Once at EDC Vegas 2011 and then a few weeks ago at EDC again. The guy is a really goofy showman who brings out an iPad and types stuff like “Music is Life” or other cliché stuff. But I buy into his shtick and so do most of his crowds because that is what Trance is about. #TranceFamily is no joke and there’s really nothing more enjoyable to me than belting out the lyrics to a Dash Berlin classic surrounded by his other diehard fans. As you can imagine, I was incredibly disappointed when he had seven minutes left at sunrise two weeks ago and didn’t clothes with “Man On The Run.”

The following songs are roughly in order of which I like most. There are a lot of other good ones that I did not include in this post, so follow me on [Spotify](http://edmozer.wordpress.com/2013/07/03/featured-artist-dash-berlin/3t4J65lDRuWMWndF49Tp6F) or look them up yourself.

John Digweed had been DJ-ing for ten years before getting a gig at Renaissance where he met Sasha, who had been working the past few years in various acid house clubs and raves. Together, he and Sasha honed their DJ skills, focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. In 1994, they released the triple CD mix album Renaissance: The Mix Collection on Renaissance Records. It contained many popular dance hits of the time from artist such as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice as well as original productions and remixes from the duo themselves. Two years later, the duo became ""true superstars"" (AllMusic) with the release of their double CD Northern Exposure on mega-label Ministry of Sound.

While I don't agree with the article 100% (for example, live performances in electronic music have always been awesome when done right), it certainly nails it on a few other aspects. 

""There's a reason why the current crop of EDM superstars hide behind gimmicky masks and haircuts, and that reason is that they're mostly just dull as fuck, so stop staring at the booth like you're at church.""

I generally hate being cliche, but this immediately sparked my memory of seeing Armin van Buuren at Mccaren park pool in Brooklyn. Being 17 at the time, and having not been able to go the year before, my friends and I were really unsure of what we were getting ourselves into. For one, I was the only one with a history of listening to trance. Within a few hours, we were having a blast and dancing our faces off. Not a single heart was held up towards the DJ booth, and not more than a few seconds at a time glancing towards him. We spent the entire show dancing with or at each other and those around us. Considering how awkward and introverted I was (well, still am), plus the fact that my friends listened to rock and hip-hop, it was astonishing to see how the right environment, the right people, and the right music could make us entirely free.

That used to be the exact sentiments I'd later have going out to night clubs to see my favorite DJs. As time went on, and EDM became more popular here, it was fewer and further between each time. I could probably name them in a single sitting with ease: Eco/Breakfast/Mike Saint-Jules at a warehouse in Brooklyn, Max Graham at Pachita, Eric Prydz at Roseland Ballroom... I'll probably remember a few and edit this later. Anyhow, as more people threw hearts at the DJs and spouted hash tags claiming their allegiance to their genre/style, the quality of a night out drastically decreased. 

All I can really conclude from this is that the surge in popularity has directly impacted the quality of experience at electronic music events. There was a time when everyone was there for one reason, while now it seems it's overly focused on performance value: Steve Aoki, Bl3nd, Deadmau5 coming to mind (rant within a rant, rantception: back in my day, the only people with helmets were Daft Punk!....). 

To prove my point, here's a clip of Born Slippy entirely escaping an entire crowd (excluding myself in attendance at the time, screaming to my friends) in the middle of their virgin freefest set last year:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=PcOv5wwR-DQ#t=1196s 

In closing, I'll say I truly don't have a conclusive point to come to. I hope this came across as somewhat cohesive, and that my emotions in writing it made it to the surface

TL;DR - I absolutely cherish my mccarren park pool memory and those that followed, I loathe the fact that the soul in electronic music escapes a lot of today's ""fanbase"", and I hope the next time Above &amp; Beyond plays Born Slippy in their set in the middle of Prelude that someone will implode from feels like I did.

1347558601.0,50,self.trance,ztzev,How Max Graham made me re-appreciate the art of DJing,Excess34,55,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/ztzev/how_max_graham_made_me_reappreciate_the_art_of/,"I make my way to a ton of trance and other electronic dance music events in New York City, and consider myself fairly experienced as a DJ/have some production releases under my belt. I only preface this write-up with said information to let you know that I'm very much out of the honeymoon phase of my relationship with electronic dance music nightlife. I used to go out and be absolutely obsessed with who I'd be seeing that night, digging up old live sets and listening through their discography in pre-game excitement. Eventually, that excitement dwindled because most acts will play the same tracklist world-wide and checking out their sets would only ruin their performance for me. Beyond that, I'd later be going out simply to spend time with familiar faces, or, for the purposes of networking and promoting.



I've become less and less impressed with the music I'd hear when attending the shows of even some of my favorite producers and DJs. As a DJ myself, I know the attention span of crowds is hard to keep and so I understand why plenty of DJs opt to play a set full of face-melting big room house tracks or popular vocal tunes. This is what I've come to expect, even from guys like Markus Schulz in the instances where he's playing a shorter set (granted, when he's given 6+ hours he's always an awesome performance to check out). It's still somewhat disappointing that I'm rarely intrigued by most live sets.


I have to say New York City is pretty spoiled when it comes to its resident DJs who know how to throw down: Zack Roth and Brad Miller for example always play musically awesome sets at any given time and of course the east coast trance all stars such as Eco, Breakfast and Mike Saint Jules who always remind me there are still trance DJs who can take us on a journey. Still, I had pretty much given up the idea of hearing any more well-developed sets on the fly from international DJs - right up until Max Graham took over the decks at Pachita in NYC after Alex MORPH's set.




Before I go into Mr. Graham's set, and why it was so awesome, I have to say that Pachita isn't exactly the standard EDM venue. It's more of a lounge area with a DJ booth and dance floor, and the sound system is exponentially weaker than Pacha's main room. This, as you can imagine, drastically impacts a DJs performance as even the heaviest of tracks pushed to their limits can sound toned down or weak. 




When Max took over the decks, the entire atmosphere of Pachita underwent a drastic change and almost immediately, people were no longer jumping up and down or making hearts with their hands. Nobody was standing in awe of his presence. Still, the dance floor didn't clear with his first track which had just the right amount of techno influence. What I always hope for in a night out happened in a matter of minutes: DJ worship ended and appreciation of the musical journey began.




From that point on, it was EXACTLY how I remember some of my earlier clubbing experiences. I was dancing in the crowd, facing my group of friends and not the DJ. Almost everyone in attendance was doing the same - exactly how it should be. Any time I'd glance at the DJ, he wasn't posing or holding his hands up acting as the clubs puppet master. It wasn't a show based on stage presence, like I've come to expect. He let his set do the talking, and paid close attention to his crowd. 




From driving, drum-heavy techno tracks to a hand full of trancier tunes (plus everything in between, constantly changing and evolving with each song), not once did I feel this set was forced. It was entirely appropriate for the venue, very much represented his work and sound as a trance producer and head of a record label, and still kept adjusting to the crowd to keep us moving. His tracklist was clearly not predetermined, or he knew in advance just how to play to his listeners. 




Whatever the case may be, I thought Graham's set was flawless, and I'm glad there's still well known producers out there who can keep a crowd moving while still promoting their own sound and avoid playing the latest beatport top10

edit:

TL;DR:
- Lots of DJs play the same set across the globe and/or fill their track list with choon after choon, no real journey
- Max Graham was really impressive

* Livestreams must be posted as a self-post.

It is our opinion that just because there is an hour of Trance during a 7-8 hour broadcast, this doesn't warrant being posted until the Trance part of it.

We have also agreed that in order to facilitate more discussion and participation, self-posts are the way to go. The user posting the self-post should be updating it with tracklists or links to the live stream with the artist lineup/schedule. 

Finally, Technonerd, if he is willing, will take priority on posting the ASOT 600 submissions/discussions as he has done incredible work on all the events so far (such as information and live tracklistings).

Now I live in the Minneapolis area so I get to go to more shows. This is the first time Oakie has come here in 2 years.

I've seen the big names (Tiesto, Armin, Markus) and they are all great, but Oakie is something different. The Goa Mix blew my mind and opened doors for my musical taste. One of his newer mixes, Nevermind The Bollocks Here's Paul Oakenfold, is amazing imo. I love his Full-On Fluoro radio show and that he is returning to his roots.

I immediately jumped on buying tickets and using 4 hours floating holiday to see him. If you live in the area, you can still buy them on Vital Culture. I almost missed it because of the Madonna tour. The gig isn't even listed on Songkick.

Remember the days of old raves, where songs could last hours and raves last days? Maybe you don't, and maybe they didn't, but that doesn't change the fact that there's a lot of awesome classic trance out there. Sadly, tho, there isn't much love to be found for classic trance here. I blame the fact that it isn't exactly played on radios, since it's over 20 years old and didn't have a huge hold of the market to begin with.

So, I'm now taking it upon myself to advertize /r/ClassicTrance. [Do you like some Age of Love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWs5_rHr4Dc)?

As many of you are aware, I'm a trance producer and have been [sharing my music](http://soundcloud.com/miracleblue) with you all for yonks. You guys have given me amazing feedback, and I've met some incredible producers and DJs here.

For many years, people from all over the world have been asking me if I'm ever going to put a tour together and go play in their respective locations. Most of these requests come from the US (I'm australian based).

Turns out, we may finally have the chance to get me on my very first North American show. There's an event in Idaho called [Esthetic Evolution](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Esthetic-Evolution/51935320442) that books many international artists big and small. There's currently an effort underway to show them that I would be a worthy booking under the ""small artist"" category. In 2-3 weeks, announcements should be made.

It would be amazing to come and play this show, as I've heard it's one hell of a doof (doof = australian colloquialism for ""rave in the wilderness"")

If this show comes through, it could pave the way for more shows as well.  So, if you live around Idaho or are looking at going to this event and would like to see me play, [please let them know](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Esthetic-Evolution/51935320442) (without spamming, thanks!)

The list below includes top upvoted tracks of all time that were posted more than once and are now being considered for auto removal and will be archived in our wiki.

To give credit the list was compiled by thespecial1.

The reasoning behind this list is to reduce re-posts that constantly get high upvotes and also to bring out newer content that will keep /r/trance great to come back to. 

If you have any tracks that you'd like to be considered in this list, please tell us your reasoning and the mod team will consider it.

Cheers,

Sassan

Although I don't like the song as a whole, from 0:00-1:11 of [Red Herring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oULiHlFCXi4) by Union Jack is one of the most beautiful pieces of electronic I've ever heard in the 16 or so years I've loved trance.   If this thread takes off at all I'll list some others.


What are some specific parts of songs that you absolutely love? I'm not talking about favorite song as a whole, just a specific part, as I said I don't like [Red Herring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oULiHlFCXi4) as a whole piece, but the beginning is amazing. I'm really curious to see your favorites and how they vary from person to person. 

**EDIT** Just posted this and already getting awesomeness.  Try to link the song and specify the exact time in said song.  We have a pretty small community by reddit standards and I really think it's awesome to spread this kinda stuff around; it only adds different styles of trance to our iPods or youtube playlists.

**2nd EDIT** This is pretty awesome I'm hearing some great tracks that I wouldn't have before, hope you all are enjoying them too.  I'm a bit sick so tomorrow I'll link 4 or 5 of my favorite parts in trance.

The purpose of the CD was to give to a friend who recently got into the genre in order to show him some different songs over the past 16 years. It's impossible to just pick one from each year (esp 98-00, and 03-05) but that is what I tried to do. My list is heavily biased towards my favorite songs and doesn't try to pick the ""best"" song from each year. 

Anyway, I thought I would share my list so far and would love to get hear some more examples (with their release date) as I hope to make a number of volumes. Thanks!

PS: I have vocal trance edition as well I can post if people are interested. My goal for this one was to use non-vocal tracks.

I know that the announcements bit hangs down a bit into the sidebar on mobile devices, and I'm looking into it. If you notice any other bugs or weird things, post 'em in here and I'll try to get them fixed.

I can't take total credit for this (although I'd love to), the guy who sent the question to mister Jezper in the first place and, in turn, initiated our very first historic AMA was (edit: spelling) [subgrafix](http://www.reddit.com/user/subgrafix).  He was our faithful messenger on this occasion.

Now, I ask you, who should be next?  Leave your ideas of who you'd like to see do an AMA in the comments.  Or, even better, take the initiative and make first contact like subgrafix!

###Some select comments on questions.

**What do you like about r/trance?**

* Community
* As a returner to the trance world, 8 years away after being immersed completely I was lost as to where to head.  The posts and recommendations here have slam -dunked me firmly back into the trance world and life is grand.
* Very minimal circle-jerking, relatively low amount of elitists, accepting of (most) trance artists.
* Diverse fanbase, good discussions, good moderation.
* The emotion. How a simple melody spanning a few bars, replayed for 4-10 minutes, can change your emotion with ease. The music never gets old and I can pick a song based on my mood and just let the music take over. I can listen to a track that makes me want to cry, party, sleep, or fly, or all of those emotions in one track. Every song is a different journey and I can listen to it all day. 
* Everything

**What do you dislike about r/trance?**

* Pointless posts, repeated ""What's your favorite....""
* Elitism in comment sections. Some people seem to think older trance is infinitely superior to any new releases.
* Circlejerk
* I despise all the negativity about current trance. There are some legitimate complaints, but it seems to always devolve into bitching about how trance doesn't sound like it did 10+ years ago. Personally, I'm finding new incredible music every single week. Some of it sounds ""classic"", some of it new, some of it a good mix of both. I'd rather see people sharing and talking about those then bitching about what they miss.. maybe they need a r/classictrance
* Not enough news about the scene and low amount of open discussion threads
* That there seems to be some kind of barrier of knowledge between ""old"" trance fans and newer ones, I'm almost afraid to ask about it because some oldies might downvote me into oblivion. I'm still relatively new to trance, so I've much to learn. It seems like a lot of posters seem almost clique-y about their trance, and even go so far as to shun certain artists that I personally love, Dash Berlin for example (though I do think their declining ASOT 600 was a pretty dick move). It's just that I can't exactly see why.
* Everyone argues like a Canadian
* I don't laugh a lot :( there aren't too many jokes.
* The comments sometimes come off as snobbish.  It's fine to dislike other things, but there's no need to be a jerk about it.
* People posting ""obvious"" tracks.
* It seems like most people don't vote on a track unless it's by a popular artist/producers...the most upvoted submissions are something trivial and mostly irrelevant to the main point of the sub-reddit.

**Thoughts on our moderators**

* Cool dudes, what more can I say.
* I haven't seen any mod posts or anything, but I assume they remove anything that isn't trance from r/trance, and considering I haven't seen any non-trance they must be doing their jobs!
* Fun competitions, no dramas, seems pretty transparent.
* They appear to be on top of their shit. Thank you r/trance mods.
* Mods are a little too quick to remove songs they don't feel are trance

**Suggestions to better the Trancit Weekly Podcast**

* Need intro/outro/ID during.  Possibly even a host.
* Yes, ADVERTISE IT! I had no idea it existed!
* Rated in the middle because I don't listen to it.
* Definitely needs 'jingles': an intro/outro and somewhat frequent mentions that this is an r/trance podcast. I wouldn't want anyone's mixes stolen from a scummy, lazy, local DJ and pretend it's their own mix

**Suggestions and Comments for the Album of the Week**

* Paul Oakenfold - Bunkka
* I think one Album per week is too much. I'd prefer Album of the month!
* I don't really care about the AotW, I'd rather see a simple list of albums that are released or soon will be.
* I like it. You should make an AOTW playlist on Spotify that is nothing but these Albums. Also, would love a ""Track of the Week"" and ""Remix of the Week"" as well.
* I feel like the albums of the week aren't mainstream enough, or they always seem to be proggy and on the fringe of trance.
* Perhaps more compilation albums (ISOS / Markus Schulz's compilations / Will Holland's digitally enhanced). Most albums of the week seem to be single artist albums

**Changes you would like to see?**

* List of common searches (best non-vocal, what made you get started with trance, etc.) linked somewhere with reposts of this removed.
* I think it would be a good idea to force mixes (be it home made or live rips) to self-post only. No more pretty thumbnail luring, authors can post tracklist and download links if possible.
* More moderators that are active and come up with nice things like contests and AMA's.
* Maybe consider blacklisting certain artists like other music subreddits have done.
* Pull up the name of the countries flag when you mouseover it - like what /r/bicycling does.

**Any other thoughts?**

* Keep doing what you're doing!
* Please make it more visible for people to visit TranceCirclejerk if they want to rage on another genre or on Avicii - Levels 
* Sassanix is a beast.
* NEEDS MORE FSOE
* Great job guys.
* It would be cool if there were a tagging system for the song posts so I knew ahead of time what kinda tracks they were (and thus, which ones I'd be interested in hearing).  Also, it would be wonderful if the redditquete asked people to, when linking to youtube, take advantage of the ""&amp;t="" feature to direct-link to the song's drop (or like 15-30 seconds before it) so I don't click on a link and waste 3 min with endless thumping.  This is mainly because if I'm clicking on a song submission link in r/trance it's to hear NEW songs, not songs I know, so I just want to know whether I like it

**The Best of Trance** and **December Mix Competition**

Survey Link Here:

[Google Docs Survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGd1b0JWNUltZXBKekVVYnBxdVhMcUE6MQ)

--------------------------------------------------------

*So how does this work?*

* Glad you asked.  Instead of posting a comment and counting up votes like years past, I decided to go a little more in-depth this year: Google Docs.  That's right, a form with many, many inputs.  

* You are still welcome to post your favorite songs here in this thread, but only songs entered into the Survey will count.

*What are the rules?*

* The only thing that is required is your top 5 tracks of 2012 (in similar style to ASOT's TOTY voting)

* For consistency when counting votes, please format as ""Artist - Track (Remix).""

* For example, in the entry space for Top Tune of 2012, I would write: Swedish House Mafia - Levels (Back 2 Trance with W&amp;W's Mix)

*What constitutes 2012?*

* The track must have been released somehow between December 1st, 2011 and November 30th, 2012.  Earlier or later tracks will be invalid.  Check [Beatport](http://www.beatport.com) or [Discogs](http://www.discogs.com) if you need to.

*How are you counting the tracks?*

* 5 points will go to the top track, 4 points for #2, and so on.  Different versions of the same track will be counted for that track (so two top choices of Unity [Pure Intro Mix] and Unity [Solarstone's Metabreaks Remix] will give 10 points to Orkidea - Unity).  When I post the results, I will highlight the most popular remix based on frequency occurrence.  

*What's with the rest of the survey?*

* The rest of the survey is completely optional and will have no bearing on your Top 5 Tracks.  I do encourage you to fill it out, though.  It goes over your thoughts on best (and overplayed) tracks, albums, artists, and shows of 2012.  I also have a section dedicated to misc. questions (such as best music video), online trance purchases, and a final page on your thoughts about this subreddit.  On behalf of the moderating team, I especially encourage you to fill out this last page.  I personally will be reading every response and sharing the results with the other moderators of this subreddit.

* In short, this is a subreddit-wide survey, as well as seeing what you all enjoyed this year outside of individual songs.


----------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, here's how the the survey is going to work:

* Submit your responses by **December 15th, 2012 by 11:59:59 PM**.  I will then tally up the results and post them on r/trance within 24 hours or so.

* From there, we start our **December Mix Competition** (I'll repost rules when the time comes).

* **Rules:**

* The theme is ""Best of 2012."" 

* Take any of the Top 50 tunes from the list posted on /r/trance (the list that I'll post on or around December 16th).  Only requirement: *you must include the top tune somewhere in your mix.*  (Edit: Subject to Change)

* Make a mix any way you want however you want. 

* It should be 1 hour in length

* Send me a link by **December 23rd, 2012 by 11:59:59 PM** of your mix uploaded on Mixcloud, Soundcloud, Archive, etc.

* On December 24th, I'll post a page with links to submissions.  Upvote and comment. 

* On December 31st at 11:59:59PM, I'll count the up votes.  

* Winner gets front page recognition *and* will have his or her winning mix as the featured mix on our weekly podcast, Trancit Weekly, for January 6th, 2013.  


----------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry for the long post.

**TL;DR**: Go vote for your Top Tracks [by taking this Google Docs survey here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGd1b0JWNUltZXBKekVVYnBxdVhMcUE6MQ)  Fill out the rest (optional but highly recommended). Hit submit.  Do it before the end of December 15th.  I post results. You mix it. We all vote.  Winner takes all.

Ask if you have any questions.  Comment your thoughts or songs if you'd like.

Cheers,

I am the admin for the Trance Family UAE and along with over 80 other pages from around the world we have put together the Universal Trance Day (UTD).

The idea is to initially set up 24 hours of trance broadcasting from some of Trance's top DJs and to stream the mixes on several radio stations around the world.

In the future, there are also plans to set up events in selected countries in order unite the world in the name of trance.

Andrew Rayel - 550 Senta (Aether Mix)

Orjan Nilsen - Lucky Strike

We DO exist. I dunno where you all are supposedly looking, but apparently you're not looking hard enough. :P

Also, as a female who regularly listens to TATW, ASOT, and attends on average about 2 trance concerts a month, I feel my level of appreciation for trance may be a huge nerdy turn off to the men I tend to meet. :/ For instance, I know only know one guy (who I fall for every time we talk trance), but at the same time we'll argue over it as well.
ex:

me: ""oh wow. this new tritonal remixes album is totally bangin'.""

him: ""I miss old trance."" 

me: ""shut up. the classics will always be there for us to appreciate and share with each other, but try opening your mind to this new stuff as well.""

But just like you males, it's not like its easy as a girl to find a good trance loving SO either. I'll wear my T-shirt autographed by AvB, A&amp;B, Markus Schulz, Aly &amp; Fila and M&amp;S54 and its not like it gets all that noticed. 
Trance is sometimes just too small of a sub-culture to find others like us in our everyday lives. 
So for those of you who have someone special to share that with, I am jealous. I would absolutely treasure being able to share something like trance that is so important in my life with someone I love. And hopefully one day I'll have that.

1342124784.0,37,self.trance,wgljq,So I have this theory...,k4osth3ory,47,10,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/wgljq/so_i_have_this_theory/,"the reason people find trance repetitive is that they are not really listening to the song. For most songs, the producers are constantly introducing new instruments for the audience to listen to. However, these instruments may not be the loudest; they might even be the quietest. If you are not listening for these new instruments, you believe that the producer is simply playing the beat for however many seconds. In other genres (more popular ones), the instrument that the audience is supposed to pay attention to is the loudest or at least close to the loudest. This is why it is easier for people to enjoy these other genres; they don't have to really listen. 

This is just my speculation. Feel free to disagree. 

Second theory: The way that I know a mix album is truly spectacular is when I find myself constantly listening for the introduction and disappearance of different instruments. I like to challenge myself when listening to them to see if I can hear all the different subtleties. In addition, I like to listen for the introduction of the next song, to hear exactly when and where the dj decided to mix in the song. It's a tiny victory every time I can hear the next song being played. There are still a few that I listen to and still can't hear the difference, or catch it very rarely. Those being the mix from Raincry to OBE, OBE to I'm Free (I have no idea where Playdo's Mix starts), and Liquid Cool to Last Train to Lhasa (from Northern Exposure).

I had an idea to make some kind of radio show for trancit. I asked sassanix about it and he liked the idea, so now I'm going to present it to the people here and see what the opinions are.

So the idea is, ther ewill be a weekly schedule of Trance broadcasts in the sidebar of /r/trance. Every week there will be radio shows on Mixlr. If you are unfamiliar with Mixlr, check the website at www.mixlr.com and you will discover; it's nothing more than a broadcast website where you can broadcast your Line-In or Microphone input.

Broadcasters will just have to make an account and when the broadcast time has arrived, he or she will start broadcasting with their own account! (or maybe we can make an /r/trance account?)

I think it would be great to let people from /r/trance make their own ''radiostation'' with this. People can send in their mixes and if it's good, he or she can get their own broadcast time with the Mixlr account.

I just decided to take a bike ride around 8:45 P.M. I set off outside, and it was about 40 degrees. Right around dusk, perfect time for a quick ride. I have my iPod, and I'm listening to some trance. Nothing really catches my ears, I just keep going. It's quite good biking music. I keep going, and I come out of the woods that my road winds through, coming out into completely open farmland. The song changes, to [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsrNkWz8ybc). I don't really notice until I crest the hill, and I just have to stop. Behind me, the sun is setting, turning the sky and the clouds red. In front of me, a gigantic and extremely bright moon is rising into the clear sky, turning it a beautiful indigo. I stop. The song seems to fit the moment I am in perfectly. I wait, and listen, looking up at the sky, and I feel completely at peace. The build comes, and shivers shoot through me that have nothing to do with how cold it is outside. You know the ones. My eyes close, and it is the best I have felt in a long time. Unfortunately, the song has to end, and the moment is over. Another one comes on as I head home, happy. 

Thought many of you could relate. It's times like these that make me sad that my friends aren't into trance. They don't know what they're missing.

I'm not a moderator or anything but I just wanted tell you guys that there have been quite a number of reposts around here lately. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with things as we should all be able to share music freely with each other and not everybody reads r/trance everyday and may have missed something. However, I noticed that I wasn't the only person to have noticed this lately so I figured it might have been noticable to some others lately.

Obviously there's no real 'time limit' that you should use (i.e. It was posted a month ago so you shouldn't post it again), but just use your general sense of disgression when posting some of the stuff.

If you want to check, you can do a quick search for the name of the song.

I put a question mark in the title because I feel kind of a 'dick' about posting this because, like I said, people should be able to post songs freely as they've discovered them. That and I'm not a moderator and I can't really say for sure what the policy is. Just food for thought, you can post if you agree or disagree.

Dabble a bit in vector?  Wanna design our new header logo (and replace my crappy placeholder green alien dude)

We here are looking for submissions for our new Tranceit alien!  Let your imagination run wild and submit your ideas to this thread!

---

**RULES**

Any posts containing a submission will be voted on by users (downvotes will not be counted, only upvotes).  After 10 days (22nd of May), the image with the most upvotes will be selected as the new logo.  However, we moderators reserve the right to reject even the most upvoted submission if we feel it's not appropriate (a trollface will not be our new logo, just sayin).

Your submission should be in PNG format, with a transparent background.  Also, it should be YOUR OWN WORK.  Other than that, it's up to you!  Go nuts :D The winner will have their work on display as the face of Tranceit for a long time to come, and we will credit their work on the sidebar with a link to their profile or their personal website or whatever they want.  Additional prizes may be included, but have yet to be decided on.

We are also looking for submissions for a new background image for the header.  Anything that is your own work, or creative commons, or public domain that you think really suits Tranceit, please also put it here for consideration.  You should clearly mark out that it's a header background submission, rather than a logo submission.

What are your views?,ryan3243,40,7,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/trance/comments/kzw6c/seems_like_trance_is_being_sampled_more_and_more/,"So I ran across [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAT1nPNvmAY).  The beat is sampled from Above &amp; Beyond/Andy Moor - Air For Life.  I've been seeing Trance samples make it into more and more Rap/Hip-Hop lately and I'm not sure I agree with it.  I know songs are sampled from other songs quite a bit, but there's not much originality in this one except the lyrics over top. I don't necessarily have an issue with the artists themselves, but what I do have an issue with is the fans that claim that this is on fire because of the beat and thinking that the artist came up with it from his own original ideas.  Not to mention the amount of bashing that people who try to point it out receive from the fan base.  Granted, I don't like hearing my Trance songs used for other genres (such as Rap/Hip-Hop or even Pop), but what am I gonna do?

What's everyone else's opinion?

So as you can obviously tell there is a whole new theme up thanks to Valency and your feedback and we've got more planned for /r/trance and we're hoping it's for the community to grow with quality.

We would like you to decide what's best to be called on the number on the sidebar, we used to have ""audiogasms"" which I came up with at 3 AM around 2-3 years a go.

What would you like to be called this time?

Looking forward to see what you guys come up with.

Your humble moderator,

**Update:** With 63 upvotes and 6 downvotes ""entranced"" is what the majority of us want to be called. So I went ahead and changed it from fans to entranced.

I discovered a Trance radio station at work through my phone. Played it at work and everybody enjoyed it and everybody's mood suddenly became lively and happy. Don't know what it is about Trance but damn I love it.

Gotta say, 8 hours of work suddenly turned into 8 hours of fun because all of my co-workers enjoyed Trance, which I had no knowledge of. On top of that, I finally found the song that got me into Trance AND I found a song I've been looking for for months.

But what I *love* is when someone starts a ""DAE think X is overrated?"" thread.

Having to defend my music taste fosters critical thinking and growth. I love talking about the intricacies and facets within songs, albums and artists, why I like or dislike them, who they are similar to, what genres seemed to have influenced them, etc. 

These discussions get me more passionate about music than the posting of a single song because they confront me and get me charged up to explore the world of music in greater depth.

So please, I'd love to see some more ""Top 10 X type of trance?"" threads, or ""I feel like the current scene is X. What do you think?"" threads. 

I love music discussions, and trance is one of my favorite genres. I hardly ever discuss it with anyone but when I do it's awesome!

What we're proposing here, is a weekly podcast from our /r/trance dj's and mixers and music lovers. Right now I'm thinking one weekly mix from a dj on the podcast list of participants. An hour long (or more) mix that can be all music or music and commentary. Focus should be trance. Participants could use this time to plug any events they might be playing in the future or to advertise their website and material.

This could be a great way to spread the word of new talent, network, and share all at the same time.

Guess what i'm really looking to do with this post is gauge interest. Who out there would be willing to participate? If there is enough interest I'll start working on a blogger site and a feed. Once we decide if its a go we can work out who will have admin abilities and such / iron out the fine details.

Hit me up here, lettuce know what you think of the idea and if you'd be willing to jump on board. then perhaps if sassan and the other /r/trance admins agree, perhaps we can get a link on the sidebar etc.

!

EDIT: Looks like we have enough interest...Once I finish Dinner I'll start setting up the blog page and the rss feed....***big thing*** what do we call it? Saw down there someone mentioned an old one called ""A State of Trancit"" should we just continue that? or Go with something completely new? Thoughts?


EDIT: So far for DJ's we have:
Gangstapantz (DJ Kyle Martin)

Eatofu

Sharkified

SharathCK

JCaliente

Piotrak

Chicane

If I missed you, PM me and let me know. Also if you have a specific DJ name you'd like to use when it's your week let me know that. I guess since there's so much interest right now, I'll do the 'ol name out of a hat to determine the order (unless anyone has an issue with that). Then once we move through the list we can either continue the rotation from the top, or ""re-roll."" Thoughts? Complaints?



EDIT:

Started setting it all up. I've got next to no graphic design skill but I tried to replicate what we have on the front page here as best as possible. I want to pick several very active users to help me out with this as admins and site designers. I have only the very basic of knowledge when it comes to this kinda stuff. Also In about five minutes I will start picking out of a hat to determine our first order of DJ's. I think that given the level of interest we will go with two mixes a week (two participants). I'm going to give eatofo the honor of starting first since he is the most recent mix contest winner. Unless anyone has any issues I'm looking to start this off next week with our first episode.


here is the blog as it stands right now, its just the bare bones but its up for checking out. leme know what you guys want to see on it.

Check site! First rotation has been determined. I'll be sending an email out today as well to everyone with the initial ""rules"" which will be likely to change.

So I was thinking, why dont we as a community choose our absolute favorite trance tracks and put together an all time top 20 list that can be called upon when you need some awesome tunes. We are after all one of the largest trance communites on the internet.

* Anyone can nominate any song. Any genre of trance is acceptable. Please post a link with your song though. Preferably youtube, if you do not know how to post a link I recommend the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://reddit.honestbleeps.com/)

* You can nominate as many songs as you like. 

* You can only nominate one song at a time.

* The list will be ranked according to upvotes only. ***NO DOWNVOTES PLEASE***
* 
So, basically if you have a song you want to put, check if it has already been nominated. If it is, upvote that track, if not, make a comment to add it. 






We can leave up this page for nominations for a while to give everyone a chance to vote and when everyone is satisfied we can close the nominations and then we will have the r/trance all time top 20.


EDIT I want to thank everyone for the awesome song posts. There are definitely some amazing songs in here that will rock our ears for years to come. Dont forget to keep checking this thread out and upvoting any tracks that you think belong on our top 20. Thanks again everybody. ^_^


EDIT 2:  **I will close up the nominations on October 1**. This thread has received some pretty solid response. I thank everyone for their picks and everyone for upvoting.
