2) Be entertaining.



**That's it.**

I'm saying this because it seems that everybody has their own specific rulebook defining what makes a good LP/channel. 

&gt; You shouldn't do Blind LPs because I can't bear to watch somebody struggle for seven seconds. 

Blind LPs can be either tedious or hilarious. The same goes for *every LP ever*.

&gt; Don't play games that big YouTubers play, because they'll gobble up all your search traffic like BIG MEANIES

Little channels can play big games too, because hey, maybe their fans want to see it from their perspective. 

&gt; Don't play Minecraft because it makes me cry and wsederfgtiuhwsegtoiuj *WAH WAH*

Who gives a fuck. If you like to play it, there's no harm in recording it.

***Seriously lads. There's no need to confuse people with your made-up crybaby rules.***

(Some light analysis + stats),ItsOppositeDayHere,110,17,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/13sgfz/is_it_worth_it_to_ask_people_to_like_your_video/,"For the past year or so I've been of the opinion that asking for Likes in any form is sort of pathetic. I don't know why but it's always rubbed me the wrong way (especially when people do it in their actual commentary) so I've completely abstained from the process for the better part of my channel's lifespan. 

That being said, I went against my gut feelings and asked people, if they enjoyed it, to ""Like"" my Hitman Absolution video so I could show impressive stats to AAA publishers in the hopes of receiving more review copies. The results were [pretty extraordinary!](http://i.imgur.com/xRwsK.png). This is from merely posting a small line in the video description (after the actual description of the video) and encouraging the practice on Facebook and Twitter. For reference, normally my videos hover around 300 likes at the low end and maybe 1,000+ for a few extraordinary ones.  

Encouraged by this, I started putting this line in my video descriptions for all of my uploads: ""If you enjoyed the video, please consider hitting the Like button. It helps a lot!"" It feels a little weird but I put it after the actual episode description in every case, so I think it's as tasteful as it can possibly be. That was about a week ago, and again, this slight reminder has had some very [dramatic results](http://imgur.com/v7eSr) so far. 

As you can see, # of daily likes has jumped from &lt;3,000 to an average of around 4,000. I'm too lazy to do any kind of statistical analysis but it certainly seems like a significant increase. 

**Other Possible Explanations**  

There's two other things that could possibly explain this increase. The first is that maybe my videos have just been better lately so more people are liking them naturally. I can't really confirm or deny this, but although it seems sort of unlikely, it could be one explanation for this trend. The other is that maybe I've just been getting more views in general so although overall Likes have increased, the same proportion/percentage of viewers are still hitting Like. This could be true as well (again, too lazy to run any kind of analysis) but my views do not appear to have increased the roughly 25% in the past week that they would have needed to in order for this to fully explain the result.  

**So what?**  

""Northernlion, who cares if your Likes are going up if you haven't noticed a corresponding increase in views?""  

Valid question, with two possible answers. 

(1) More likes may improve search ranking, thereby bringing you a higher influx of new viewers.  

Through some strange stroke of luck, I currently rank very very highly for the search terms surrounding Scribblenauts Unlimited (ie. ""Scribblenauts"", ""Scribblenauts Unlimited"", and those + ""gameplay"", ""review"", etc). This may be due to superior tagging, but it seems like Likes may have played a part in this as well, as the first video in my SU series has an uncharacteristically high number of Likes compared to my usual number (it's around 2,600 I think).   

Obviously, ranking high in searches means more viewers and thus more subscribers in the short and long run. The last few days since that series started have been on the high-end of my usual daily subscriber gain, so it's possible that asking for Likes = getting more Likes = ranking high in searches = getting more viewers = getting more subscribers [phew]. No data to necessarily back this up though. 

and also, maybe  

(2) Some people still have YouTube's homepage set to display ""All Activity"" rather than ""Uploads Only"". As such, they see their friends' likes, thus garnering slightly higher views and maybe some new audience as well. Again, totally dataless.  

**Conclusion**  

So, is it worth it to ask for likes? I think so! It has caused a marked difference for me; certainly enough to compensate for my hesitancy to do it. If you were to do it more overtly (ie. remind people to like your video in your commentary) you might see even more dramatic results but I don't do that as it makes me feel icky. 

As always, your mileage may vary, but hopefully this helps you a bit with your efforts on YouTube!

* If you play alone, you'll be watching alone for a while until you become very entertaining alone or are playing a high-demand game

* Submitting weekly updates to r/letsplay doesn't get you 10,000 views and as many subscribers

* Responding to threads offering feedback gets you 3 really good views

* You're not going to make a living playing videogames on youtube

* If you're not having fun, the audience isn't having fun

* Don't submit every video you make. If the game doesn't work for your channel or you, you don't want people to find your channel that way because they won't stay.

* Stick to a schedule. It helps with motivation and viewers like regularity. Take advantage of making your videos private on upload and then schedule them for a certain hour for a few regular days during the week. Just stay a week or a month ahead of your viewers and you'll never miss a day even if you're busy.

* Viewers will trickle in if you tag your videos correctly. Learn how to copy-paste all of the tags from ""Part 1"" to all the rest

* Remind people to subscribe/like at the end of the Part 1 videos -- they'll forget. Don't be annoying.

* Promote collaborators as much as you can. They'll do the same and share the love.

* If you want a relatively large number of regular viewers and don't want to wait to ""get lucky"", find a community that has a need and fill it. My ""minutes watched"" went from 1,000 to 2,000 in 24 hours from a single 30 minute video after asking the community if they had a need for such a thing. Make sure the idea is a series.

* Don't publish grinding in an rpg. Cut it out in post.

* Face cams are widely hated among the subreddit. Unless you're a really hot chick or very animated, it's annoying and wastes screen space.

* Aspect ratio is sacred. Don't warp my vision.

* Give other people feedback. You don't need to watch their whole video to be useful. Act as the case where the viewer is ADD and only watches the first 15 seconds to see if they like it. 90% of viewers are like this anyway.

* Intros longer than 10 seconds are too long.

* Intros longer than 5 seconds for videos in playlists are too long

* Annotations on videos that aren't Part-1s are a waste of time. Add everything into a playlist and copy-paste it into every description.

* Twitter is a waste of time unless you have a following for another reason. (edit: for promotion purposes, great for interacting with established viewers).

* Sony Vegas is easy, Adobe Premiere is incredibly powerful and fast once you learn hotkeys, Final cut is great if you have a mac. Try before you buy.

* H.264 (mp4)  with optimized settings for youtube (youtube search it) is the best balance between file size and quality, and youtube turns it into this anyway, so huge RAW files aren't going to give viewers better quality.

* Fraps is easy but greedy, capture cards are amazing, Bandicam (highly recommended below), Dxtory and others are widely preferred, but a pain in the ass and unstable (disagreement among this opinion)

* Check your settings and do a test recording before a long session

* Recording game sound and mic sound in the same track doesn't allow for tweaking in post. You're stuck with the sound levels you get.

* Comments in your videos are a huge minority of opinion. Make sure you agree with them before you give them any weight.

* Don't respond to every comment in your videos. Youtube formatting makes your comment overpower everyone else's. You want your viewers to talk freely.

* Judge a video by how many viewers in the Audience Retention are still viewing by the end of the video out of the total (in Analytics). 20% is amazing.

* If you think you should do something in post-production, but don't feel like going through the trouble, you should do that something.

* Respect people's time.

A helpful guide.",ItsOppositeDayHere,82,11,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/p2o8z/why_doesnt_anyone_watch_my_videos_a_helpful_guide/,"The past couple of days I have seen a few people lamenting how they don't have an audience and can't seem to grow one. Unfortunately, a lot of the time it's simply luck that separates a popular channel from an unpopular one, but I've created a simple image that I think might help out people who are struggling to find new fans.  

http://imgur.com/70a0m  

Note: this is just based on my experience.

The category on the bottom is the most important when it comes to growing your audience and they get less important as you go up. Please note that this does not mean your channel won't grow if you have amazing marketing but awful A/V quality. For example, even if your videos suck, a collaboration with Tobuscus is going to get you a lot of new fans. However, being realistic, this is the way I think most channels should prioritize their efforts when trying to grow an audience.  

These categories are vague so let's discuss them a little bit. 

**A/V Quality**  

Simply put, your videos have to look and sound at least decent to avoid turning people away. For videos, this means a solid framerate, crisp picture, and proper resolution (both for the console/game's output and for publishing on YouTube). It is **not mandatory** to have HD quality video but as more and more people start LPing it is becoming increasingly important.  

Audio quality is probably equally as important. Your voice should be clear, there shouldn't be noticeable background noise from the game being picked up through your mic or your computer's fan running, and the levels must be balanced well so both you and the game audio are easily heard.  

It's not likely that many people will follow you *because* your A/V quality is great, but if your A/V quality sucks then people will *avoid* following you. Consider this the equivalent of personal grooming in the dating game. You're not going to get a date simply because you brush your teeth, but you're limiting your chances if you don't.  

**Game Choice**  

Assuming your A/V setup is good, your next concern should be game choice. It's unfortunate truth that you're going to expose your videos to a much wider audience if you play popular, newer games. The reason for this is two-fold: (1) more popular games get searched more often on YouTube, giving you a much wider potential audience, and (2)   newer games have less videos so you have less competition for those searches.  

It sounds cynical but oftentimes popularity is determined by who can be the first to LP a game and thus get the lion's share of the searches. This is one big reason why most huge gaming related channels (there are exceptions -- thinking more about TotalBiscuit types, less chuggaaconroy) make at least one video covering every new game. New game + getting a video out quick = high ranking in YouTube search = tons of new people finding your videos.  

The worst consequence of this is Let's Play channels where the guy makes a ""walkthrough"" of every new game and just stops it after 10 videos when the next big game comes out. I'm not going to name names but I'm sure you can think of some.  

I'm not telling you to sell out and follow these examples. Your videos will be much better if you choose games you're passionate and knowledgeable about (usually). However, you have a much larger potential audience playing Skyrim than you will playing PaRappa the Rapper.  

**Personality**  

This is kind of the 'intangible' section. Simply put, if people like you and your style of commentary, you're obviously going to make more fans out of the people who watch your videos. This is different for everybody but usually (not always) it involves at the very least being relatively articulate, confident in your speech, and not leaving too much dead air. If your commentary sucks it will turn people off but everybody has their own style and it gets much better the more you practice. Even if your game choices are obscure, you can become more popular if people love your style.  

**Metadata**  

Easily the most overlooked facet of most channels. Your title should be  neat, with proper capitalization and the game's name and episode number/title should be clear. In the description, put (at the very least) a link to the playlist which contains the episode and clearly mark it. I put a link to subscribe to my channel and some social media links as well.  

I think it's cheesy when channels put ""Like/fav/comment/subscribe"" in their descriptions (worse when it's stated during the commentary) but it must work because pretty much every big channel does it.  

You should tag your videos extensively and search phrases should be in quotation marks. For example, you should tag a SMW video as ""super mario world"" (in quotes), otherwise it will be parsed as ""super"", ""mario"", and ""world"".  

Proper metadata will help you rank higher in searches, which is of vital importance to reaching new people.  

**Marketing**  

This *can be* an extremely important area but most people go about it all wrong. If you are a small channel, things like box-for-box are totally worthless. I have something like 25k subscribers and if I put a small channel in my box they might gain 10 subscribers a week if they're lucky so if you're boxed on a channel with &lt;1,000 subscribers it's probably gaining you somewhere in the vicinity of 1-2 subscribers a month.  

Similarly, you're not going to gain much of an audience posting every episode of your LP to /r/LetsPlay or random forums (Something Awful excepted in some cases).  

The most efficient way to market your channel is through **collaborations**. Co-commentaries (posted to the larger channel with an annotation linking to the co-commentator's channel) have the potential to bring in a lot of new people but it depends on the quality of the video, and of course, the size of the channels. Obviously if you can do a co-commentary with Yogscast or something you're pretty much set, but most people are going to have to think smaller than that and work at it constantly.  

**tl;dr** Look at the picture. If your A/V sucks, don't waste your time posting your videos to forums because nobody will watch them anyway. Playing unpopular games (not that that's a bad thing) might be a big reason why your channel is unpopular. Use proper goddamn English in your metadata.  

**Disclaimer: I always take flak from these threads in PMs from people who assume I'm some kind of cold, calculating businessman who is sucking the life out of LPing. This simply isn't true and if you watch any of my content you'll see that I'm passionate about what I do and largely don't resort to ""partnery"" tactics that would inflate my metrics but make me feel icky.

Recording with Fraps can leave you with huge file size chunks of video. If you like to record footage for more than one video at a time, but don't like your HDD stuffed with raw AVI files, consider re-encoding them with VirtualDub. I've successfully used it to turn huge Fraps'd files into more manageable file sizes (but do make sure you see if the re-encoded files are up to your standards of video quality before deleting your big Fraps files!)

Good audio can add a lot to a video - often, the game's soundtrack will be enough, but for either extra added drama (or for that intro/outro), here's a bunch of stuff you can use for free.

Audacity is a great recording and editing suite. Best of all, it's entirely free! Consider recording your voice in Audacity *while* playing your game / whatever you do, as this will leave you free to enhance your voice in case the game's audio is louder than your microphone's audio. 

This program has a *ton* of functionality, so consider getting it no matter what.

I'm not sure if Avid is still in use, but ~10 years ago when I finished high school (and had an extensive A/V class), we used Avid for editing.

**[Games]**


Free games are always nice, for the aspiring Youtuber! Most of what I list here will be indie, as few AAA games are free :p

[Super Crate Box](http://www.supercratebox.com/)

Retro / arcade platformer with a chiptunes soundtrack.

[The Free Bundle](http://www.thefreebundle.com/)

The third Free Bundle is currently out - but be aware that you can easily access Bundles 1 and 2, and you can still download those games (at least at the original time of writing, you could).

[Free Indie Games at freeindiegam.es](http://www.freeindiegam.es/)

There's new indie games available for download for free pretty often.

[Homesick - a short indie horror game](http://www.youtube.com/user/ChloeSagal?feature=watch)

I linked to the Youtube channel of the developer of this game. Find the download link to this neat looking short horror game in the channel description! :)

[Warface](http://www.warface.com/en/)

Warface is an upcoming free-to-play AAA FPS by none other than CryTek. I don't think the beta has gone from closed to open yet, but I had a load of fun with the game at last year's Eurogamer Expo (It will feature both traditional team vs team gameplay, as well as a 4-person co-op campaign).

I've been watching gameplays for atleast a few years now. I love watching them because they're so much fun. 


**The problem:**

Lately, I've seen a lot of fantastic gameplay videos go completely unnoticed and it seems that only people with thousands of subscribers are able to get views which makes it very hard for the small guys to get views. 

**The Solution:**

So this is my idea: Instead of subscribing to some users who make lets plays, people should be subscribing to games and commentators should all be able to post to that game, similar to having subreddits. This would allow for equal opportunity for views and allow the smaller channels to get noticed. 

**Execution:**

I spent the last 2 weeks building [commentato.rs/](http://commentato.rs/) .Users can follow games and post videos in a certain game. E.G. If the user is following Starcraft and you post a video in starcraft it will show up in their feed hence giving everybody equal opportunity.

Please note: this is just a little prototype and it is still in beta. It doesn't even have a logo yet. Anyway, what does /r/letsplays think? I'd love to have to feedback. In addition, I'm happy to take some feature requests.

**Edit 1:**  Okay guys, I've added form so you can add games manually: http://commentato.rs/game/add   I'm now working on the rewards system with user points and all that.

**Edit 2:**  The first 1K users will also be getting a VIP and founders badge when I'm done with the badges system! I would really appreciate it if I can get a shout out in your next video :D Also, twitter: https://twitter.com/Commentato_rs

Okay so this is the to-do-list so far:

	[x]-fix video page - does not show following game button correctly after refresh (wrong one)

1336942808.0,51,self.letsplay,tlfm9,"The Importance of Proper, Exhaustive Tagging",ItsOppositeDayHere,60,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/tlfm9/the_importance_of_proper_exhaustive_tagging/,"One thing I've noticed with a lot of videos posted here is that there's a huge prevalence of people tagging their videos improperly, irrelevantly, or simply inadequately. Improving and expanding on the tags you attach to your videos is an extremely important part of the marketing process that many people overlook for some unfortunate reason.  

**Why is tagging so important?**  

Proper tagging improves your search rankings which, for most of you, is going to be the single best source of traffic. Good tagging = higher search rankings for more terms = more viewers = more people who subscribe and come back again and again to continue watching your videos.  

Also, unlike a co-commentary with a bigger channel, search traffic is relatively consistent and builds over time. As I said in a thread yesterday, a co-commentary with a friend who has 500 subscribers might bring you 50 new fans the day it's posted, but by optimizing your tagging you might be able to bring in 5 new fans a day for every single day of your channel's lifespan due to improved search rankings, which adds up over time and over the dozens and dozens of videos you make.  

**Examples**  

HiTrueFittLetsPlay posted [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyrXT09ofDI&amp;feature=youtu.be) on the subreddit today. I don't know these guys personally so I apologize if they take offense to this, but this is a good example of inadequate tagging that could definitely do with some optimization. Their tags are:  

*Matty&amp;Sam Play: THE HOUSE Ep Sam stop screaming*  

Lots of problems here that I see in a lot of videos posted on this subreddit.  

* **Improper Parsing**: This is the biggest mistake most people make with tagging. If you don't put phrases in quotation marks, YouTube parses them word-by-word. So, *Sam stop screaming* is parsed by YouTube as ""Sam"", ""Stop"", and ""Screaming"" which is totally useless. Phrases should be contained within quotation marks to keep them intact. For example, instead of tagging your video as *super mario world music*, tag it as ""Super Mario World music"". Easy tip that can have a big impact on your visibility.  

* **Irrelevant Tagging**: Not to harp on this, but even if ""Sam stop screaming"" was contained within quotation marks it would be a bad tag because nobody is going to search for that (probably). People oftentimes add joke tags, which is fine and can add a bit of enjoyment for people who actually read them, but don't add them at the expense of relevant tags.  

* **Inadequate Tagging**: What I mean by this is that there's simply not enough tags. YouTube gives you something like 500 characters to tag and, even if you can't fill it, you should take advantage of it by tagging as comprehensively as possible while still being relevant to your video content.  

**How do I think of more tags?**  

* Go to the YouTube homepage, type the name of the game in the search bar, and wait for the drop down to populate. This will give you a handful of the most popular search terms for the game you're posting content for.  

* Think of common misspellings or re-arrangements of a game's name. In another thread I used Bomberman 64 as an example. I would probably do a lot of tags with ""Bomberman 64"" in them, then a few with ""Bomber Man 64"" to catch people who typed it in that way.  

* Combine the name of the game with terms that people commonly add to the end of searches for video games on YouTube. For example, instead of doing one tag only (say, ""Super Mario World""), you should do several tags with ""Super Mario World"" + one or more of the following: ""gameplay"", ""video"", ""review"", ""let's play"", ""lp"", ""music"" (if it's relevant) to create a variety of possible search phrases. Wrap em all in quotation marks and you're good to go.  

I wanted to post a bit more but I've been interrupted and have to leave for a while, but feel free to ask questions/post your own suggestions in here and I'll reply when I get back.  

I'm not promising that these will get you to the #1 search rank for whatever game you're playing, but taking an extra 5 minutes when tagging can, I assure you, make a huge difference ESPECIALLY when your channel is small/just starting out.

**EDIT**: Okay, I'm back. The last thing I wanted to mention is something to kind of temper expectations people might have that proper, exhaustive tagging will make them compete with much larger channels for visibility on the first few pages of popular searches. Unfortunately, there are a lot of other factors that go into determining search rankings which usually give larger channels a huge advantage when it comes to ranking highly for specific search terms. Obviously I'm not privy to YouTube or Google's exact search algorithm, but they've mentioned that # of likes, comments, and views, as well as the ratio of views to likes and comments are both taken into account. So, smaller channels are often at a disadvantage because they don't have the sheer volume of viewers to compete for these statistics.  

That being said, these tips will give you the best chance to be up there. My first 'big break' on YouTube was when I started Let's Playing Super Meat Boy back when it released. I had &lt;100 subscribers before I started that series, but through proper tagging and being in the right place at the right time, I ranked among the top 4 or 5 results for most searches for Super Meat Boy which gave me the kickstart I needed to start becoming more popular. If I could do it back then, you can do it now! It takes more than just proper tagging, but taking some extra care with your tags is a way that you can dramatically improve your visibility with only a few extra minutes of effort per video.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,True,,youtube,True,t3_tlfm9,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/tlfm9/the_importance_of_proper_exhaustive_tagging/,

Don't let the fact that it's free fool you. It's a powerful little tool, and works just as well as many of those paid audio editing programs. 

Recording your voice with Fraps, DXtory, or whatever capture program you use is fine, but if you want to make your audio even better, Audacity is great because it allows you to manipulate some things. There are a lot of great tutorials on youtube, and on the audacity website, but for now we'll cover some of the basic stuff to get you started. For a few more advanced tricks please see [**THIS Post**](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bn7dd/posted_tutorial_audio_quality/)



_______________________________________________________________________________


**Your Settings** - This can be down to personal preference, but these settings should help you get started.  Reference [**THIS POST**](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bn7dd/posted_tutorial_audio_quality/) For your best audio quality! **Thanks to /u/ExclamationDan**

First, go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Interface. [These are the basic settings you should use](http://imgur.com/a/C5uQ6#0) 

Next, go to Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Quality **[Here are the settings you should use for optimal audio quality.](http://imgur.com/a/C5uQ6#1)**

Finally, set your audio to record in MONO, **[shown here](http://i.imgur.com/Glrxq9z.jpg)** All vocal tracks should be recorded in mono, with game audio recorded in stereo.

Here's why you should use mono, thanks again /u/ExclamationDan

&gt;Stereo has two channels for each track of audio. If all you're recording is speech or a video game, both channels will hold the same or very similar information. This doesn't increase quality but rather wastes disk space.

&gt;This makes audio encoding and editing more or less twice as work intensive for programs in addition to resulting in a larger file size. For the vast majority of recordings and people who make YouTube videos, stereo offers little to no benefits. Mono only holds one channel per track.

So you've downloaded Audacity...now what? Well, open it, silly!

Okay, now you've got it opened...and it looks scary! Fear not! It may look daunting at first, but I assure you, it's quite simple to use! Right now you should be looking at something [similar to this](http://i.imgur.com/UvBVQ8a.jpg).

Great, I see a lot of grey, some buttons, and some other crap, so what? Well, let's cover some of the ""crap"" you're looking at. So, going from left to right we have...
_________________________________________________________________________________

**Control Bar** - **[This fancy little guy](http://i.imgur.com/JsrxSbh.jpg)** is your control bar. This is how you will record your audio, and play it back. Simply enough, and I'm sure you already knew it, but this is the basics, after all! 

________________________________________________________________________________


**Tools** This is possibly one of the more important things you need to know. **[These](http://i.imgur.com/ShXXJW0.jpg)** will allow you to (From left to right, top to bottom) select, envelope, draw, zoom,  and shift time.

 **Select -** This allows you to select specific parts **[like so](http://i.imgur.com/UtiVBtI.jpg)**

**Envelope** - This lets you shift the volume of the audio over time based on control points that you place on the track. Useful for fad-ins and fade-outs, though there is an effect you can apply in Audacity to do so also. **[Example](http://i.imgur.com/YzcgMsr.jpg)**

**Draw Tool** - **[Allows you to ""draw""](http://i.imgur.com/ixBmjZ0.jpg)** in the samples, and is  useful for editing out pops and crackles. You need to zoom in until you can see the individual sound waves. I don't use this at all, as a LPer since I never really need to get THAT detailed.

**Zoom** - It zooms. Yeah.

**Shift Time** - This allows you to become Doctor Who. Kidding aside, This allows you to take a sample of audio (Try selecting a small piece with the selection tool!) and move it around the time line. This can be useful from syncing audio, or placing something you wanted to say after a particular part in your video, and many other reasons. **[Example](http://i.imgur.com/kMO5P5f.jpg)**


_______________________________________________________________________________

So we've covered the tools, what's next? Oh yes, **[the monitors!](http://i.imgur.com/lqlfiGL.jpg)**

The monitor on the left is for your output levels. These will light up when you press play on your recorded audio and let you keep an eye on how loud or quiet your audio is.  The monitor on the right lets you see how loud or quiet your input - or microphone audio is. If you left click on your input monitor, it allows you to see your microphones audio levels even while not recording! This helps you get a good idea on positioning, volume, etc. even before hitting record. **You should, however, always do test recordings before you start recording a LP!**

Next in Line? Ah yes, **[Mr. and Ms. volume](http://i.imgur.com/OG8vjod.jpg)**, and their children. From left to right we have the basics, which you should all be familiar with:

**Cut** This is just like when you cut some text out of notepad and paste it somewhere else, but with audio. Allows you to cut out a piece of audio and place it somewhere else, either in the same audio file or in another. This is destructive.

**Copy** Same deal as before, but rather than cutting out and removing that audio from the sample, you are copying it, with the ability to place it anywhere in the same sample, or a different.

**Paste** Well, remember those samples you cut/copied? This is how you place them.


Next we get a little more different...

**Trim** This will remove any audio around a selected segment, **[like so](http://i.imgur.com/XTanPUJ.jpg)**

**Silence** This will mute any sound you have **[selected.](http://i.imgur.com/WcNs0mT.jpg)**

Next!

**Undo** Well, you should know what this does...but essentially if you make a boo boo, you can hit undo (or CTRL+Z / Command +Z) and your boo boo will go away.

**Redo** We all love second tries. This is Undo's ""hero"" brother. That time you accidentally undid something, this guy fixes it by stepping forward a step.

**Sync Locked Tracks** I'll be honest, I've never used this before, and have no idea what it does, so coming right from the Audacity page: 

&gt;""Any audio track in Audacity can be in a group of one or more adjacent tracks that can be Sync-Locked with other tracks in that group. Sync-Lock is off by default, but can be turned on at Tracks &gt; Sync-Lock Tracks or by using the Sync-Lock Tracks button () in Edit Toolbar.

&gt;When Sync-Lock is on an icon () shows bottom right in the Track Control Panel of each track in a Sync-Locked group provided at least one of those tracks is selected. The icon denotes all tracks that will be affected when a menu operation in a selected track inserts or deletes audio (or otherwise changes the audio's position on the Timeline). The unselected tracks that will be affected are denoted by a patterned ""Sync-Lock"" selection in the waveform instead of the dark gray of a normally selected track.

&gt;Label Tracks can be included in a group so that their labels are synchronised with the audio. If present a Label Track also delimits a track group so that the audio track(s) underneath are in separate group(s). Tracks in those groups will not be affected by actions in the group above unless at least one track in those separate groups is selected. If a group includes more than one label track, the bottom label track delimits the group.""

Best of luck with that...

The rest in that row are just other ways of zooming in and out.
_______________________________________________________________________________


Whew! That was a lot! We're almost done!

The last bar you see is one damn important bar. From these drop down menu's, you select your audio host (shouldn't have to change this, but you can), your output (Where your audio plays to), and your input (your microphone / recording device), and your input channels (Stereo, mono). **For recording voice, you should use MONO!**

**[Sexy MS Paint Skillz](http://i.imgur.com/CSWk9lq.jpg)**

_______________________________________________________________________________


Last, but certainly not least: **[Effects](http://i.imgur.com/LfWniJF.jpg)**. I'm not going to go over all of them, as that's a guide for another time (and guide, many covered in the guide posted at the top) But the ones you should get familiar with are: **Amplify, Bass and Treble, Click Removal, Equalization, Fade In/Out, Noise Removal, Normalize** (I'm sure there are others, but those will be the most helpful, in my opinion, for some one just starting out.)

Welp, that about covers what you need to know to start using Audacity. I've seen a few people say they're afraid to use it because it looks complicated, and this guide is meant to get you familiar with the tools and the environment.  but it really is an essential tool in any LP's toolkit. Sorry for the wall of text, and I hope this helped those of you who want to try Audacity!

Happy LPing!

1356554301.0,43,self.letsplay,15he4a,I started out right here about 8 months ago and just hit 50000 subscribers today. Here's a look back on how it all happened.,markiplier,70,27,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/15he4a/i_started_out_right_here_about_8_months_ago_and/,"Hello everyone, my name is Markiplier and I run the YouTube channel [markiplierGAME](http://www.youtube.com/markiplierGAME)!

I've been doing Let's Plays every single day for the past 8 months and have enjoyed it immensely. I have also been fortunate enough to gain a great deal of subscribers in a very short amount of time and even though I actually LOST my first channel I fought back and started again to get to where I am today. A lot of my success is thanks to this very subreddit and the extensive advice of [NorthernLion](http://www.reddit.com/user/ItsOppositeDayHere). Before you take any advice of mine, please look at his submitted posts to understand exactly what you need to do to get started.

First off, here's a video that details the journey I've taken to get to 50000 subscribers: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f328RScu238

Above all else you have to enjoy what you're doing. If not you're just going to end up burnt out after a while without seeing proper success. I worked incredibly hard (12 hours a day) trying to get attention for my channel. I enjoyed it so much that I sprang out of bed in the morning and lost sleep at night. There are a thousand little tips I could give you but [NorthernLion](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/p2o8z/why_doesnt_anyone_watch_my_videos_a_helpful_guide/) covers all of that and more better than I ever could.

So best piece of advice that I could give you is to exhaustively connect with your audience. If you have a single person that truly enjoys your videos and messages you, you have to engage them personally. They are your champion early on and you need to make sure that they feel like it. Then more people will join you because they see how eagerly your champion promotes your material. Always try to think of new ways to keep your audience engaged and active because besides tagging and searching, your channel is going to grow primarily through word-of-mouth.

Also, capitalize on big events. These are new hyped game releases, pop-culture waves, the ""Slender"" phenomenon (if you do horror), gangnam style, pretty much anything that has people talking and has something that people are searching for. 

The hardest truth to understand is that even if your content is the best in the world, no one is looking for it. You have to make it as easy as possible for people to find you through a deep understanding of what people search for in YouTube. Once again, [NorthernLion](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/tlfm9/the_importance_of_proper_exhaustive_tagging/) discusses the proper use of tagging to help your videos get noticed.

Another important piece of information to understand is that gaining popularity is not a competition. Doing collabs with channels similar subscriber level will do much more for getting exposure than anything else you could do for both of your channels. 

I could write a novel rambling about various tips and things that I think you should do to gain popularity but you'll figure it all out as you go. You get out of it what you put into it and that includes being a part of communities like this. 

Get out there and enjoy what you do because if you don't believe in yourself, no one else will.

We feel that we need to do even more for Let's Players, so we have decided to make [Let's Play For Games](http://www.letsplayforgames.com/). It is a way how to connect developers and Let's Players/streamers/reviewers by providing them **free complementary copies** of games by developers.

Let's Players are helping more people to find games.

LPers are currently more often buying games out of their own pocket (also from monetization), but we want to connect LPers and game developers even more.

We will have some requirements for Let's Players to prevent anyone getting free games and not doing anything in return, but we want to support everyone who helps gaming.

The full site will be launched soon, but before it does we want to get into contact with more LPers and game devs so that we can make the site more useful to them.

I'm going to approach this from the beginning of your upload process and move towards tagging / social media near the end of the write-up. I'm approaching 1000 subscriptions for my last month of uploads, and I know a lot of you guys are curious about how this has happened. Hopefully during this talk I can get you guys situated in the best possible place to do the same thing for your channel.  Additionally, I'd like to point out that there are LOADS of people more knowledgeable about SEO on this forum, people who have made successful careers off of their expertise and so, if I purvey wrong or poorly worded information I absolutely defer to them and hope they'll correct my errors. 

**What is SEO?**

SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, and is an industry term which refers to how well your content ranks when it's filed into a parser and sorted. Not so bad, right? Now that we're all on the same page, let's get under the hood together and talk about how it works on Youtube.

**So first things first, what makes your video special?**

 I know that this whole article is supposed to be on SEO but if your video doesn't hook people it won't matter how many watch because they won't stick around. I know guys who have videos with hundreds of thousands of views and yet, they only have 50 or so subs. This is a situation that I think we can all agree would be frustrating, to say the least. To keep this from happening, make sure your video has all the aspects that people have come to expect from Youtube media. Calls to action, humor, and proper vocal inflection can all help people feel engaged to the content you're trying to sell. READ YOUR YOUTUBE PLAYBOOK. [Here's the link, do it nao!](http://www.youtube.com/yt/playbook/) Once you feel like you can get people hooked, let's get to the good stuff : SEO!

**How Youtube Search Indexing works**

I'm going to come clean right here and say I don't know. Period. Now that I'm all done being honest, what I can tell you is that there's recurring advice given to Social media students at MIT, Harvard, Yale and other major Universities. From what most experts can tell there are a number of tests that a video is subjected to before it's given a slot to occupy in the search results. Additionally, it can Youtube weeks to finally settle a video. Just because you land on page 5 the first day, doesn't mean you'll stay there. Don't lose hope, hang in there. Every few days they rotate the videos around based on the following statistics : (This isn't a comprehensive list, no one has that aside from Youtube. These aren't in any particular order either.)

* View Count

* Title

* Keywords in the Description

* Tags

* Total interaction (Likes + Dislikes + ?Comments?)

* Like/Dislike Ratio (Likes vs Dislikes)

* Raw File Name

While some of these are self explanatory, I'll go from the beginning and talk about the ones that can be a tad deceiving. More importantly, we'll talk about the ones you have direct control over. 

**File Name**

A lot of people don't know this, but Youtube lends search weight to videos whose raw file names are relevant to the search criteria. What this means in layman's terms is that a video named ""Dogpoker.mp4"" will be favored in a search for ""Dogs playing poker"" over a video called ""132.mp4"". Therefor, it's important to name your files properly. Don't worry about renaming things that are already uploaded, it's already more than likely too late. Now that you're privy to the information, though, you can start naming your files more accurately. For example, my typical file name for a Project zomboid LP might be ""ZomboidGameplay1.mp4"". 

**Titles**

There are a number of ways to approach titles, but Youtube does index your video title for relevant tags and so it becomes important to make one that pops. I personally upload with ""Episode # - Let's Play X - Episode Title"" and have had reasonable luck with the template. However, people who are burning up the search rankings might use a title like ""Part 1 / Episode 1 - X Gameplay / Walkthrough - Episode Title / Game character name"" or any other combination of tag relevant names. Here, I'd say to use your best discretion. If you feel like your title is overly taggy and doesn't sound good, then I'd probably back off of it and do something more natural. If you want to use your titles like a tag section, that's your call and I don't blame you. Personally, I try to go for a reasonable middle ground in this regard. *Edit The playbook says to throw your relevant tag information to the front of your title for maximum effect. Thanks to JonPaula for calling this one out.*

TLDR ; Youtube parses your titles. Tag the hell out of them, or make it subtle. It's your call. 

**Video Descriptions**

A largely overlooked section in most people's videos (Mine too for a while.) but incredibly important. Youtube searches the living hell out of your descriptions for applicable keywords. This has led to a practice known as ""Tag spamming"" in a lot of larger channels. What ""tag spamming"" entails is completely overloading your description section with search relevant keywords so that you'll get a competitive edge come upload time. It's incredibly effective right now, but also looked down upon by many people. It's your call whether or not you want to do it, I don't judge. Additionally, you should always LINK your channel in the description section with a call to action. (Check out the channel : Channel link) Beyond that, it's up to you what you do in your description section. I personally load mine up hard. The visible part is typically a joke pertaining to the current episode. Below that I'll put my links, and down below that I'll have a brief synopsis of what the game is about for viewers who don't know. I like this as a middle ground as it puts relevant, search worthy tags in your description while still being helpful to the uninformed. 

TLDR; Youtube looks at your descriptions. Make them relevant. 

**Tags**

Fill this section up with every relevant keyword you can. If you're playing Megaman X, tags like ""Let's Play Megaman X"" and ""Megaman X Gameplay"" are great places to start because they're contiguous. Don't use tags like ""Megaman"", ""X"", ""Gameplay"". Those won't work well and will probably give you HIV. That's how much you want to avoid them. If you aren't filling this entire section until it flashes red, you're cheating yourself. Every tag you put in your video is another search that will yield your page as a result so do your best to fill it out completely. Stumped? Google has a tool for you. It's called [Google Adwords Keyword Tool](https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__c=1000000000&amp;__u=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS) and you should use it any time you can't think of a way to fill out your tag section. By entering the game name, for example, it will list out 100 different related and commonly hit on (giggity) search results that surround your game title. It will tell you how many hits a month that search gets, and more importantly the competition for those tags. Ideally you want to look for LOW competition tag with millions of hits. Play around with it for a while, and believe me you'll find some gems. Do yourself a huge favor, and write down / record the ones you research. Treat it as your little treasure trove of success. 

TLDR; FILL THIS ENTIRE SECTION. SERIOUSLY. 

**Audience Retention ADDED**

I wrote this entire article at 3AM while slightly inebriated so this one slipped my mind. However, your ability to keep an audience interested in your content is important. Search weight is given to those videos which retain viewers for longer amounts of time. This falls back under my initial recommendation that you only upload once you feel your content has the ability to engage an audience. You can find your specific audience retention numbers under your analytics section. Analytics &gt; overview &gt; Audience retention. The higher the better, mine's sitting around 40-45% most months, and from what I can tell (Based on my personal search rankings.) it seems to be sufficient. 

**General Info**

Those are the main points I wanted to hit. Likes / Dislikes / Comments I can't really help too much with but just try to keep people engaged. If you want to learn to write jokes, I'd recommend Gene Perret's *Comedy Writing Step by Step* as it's worked wonders for the way my brain analyzes things for possible humor. I'd recommend looking into radio / broadcasting classes / books / how to's in your free time. I used to work as a Heavy Metal Radio host and the skills I learned there have helped me immensely on Youtube. Holding a monologue with myself, breathing properly, speaking from the diaphragm instead of the throat, not saying ""um"" ever, these are all things that lend an extra little bit of cleanliness to your content. I feel like I'm talking too much at this point so I'll cut it off here. Feel free to ask questions, call bullshit, and otherwise scrutinize what I've said. I'll freely admit that Youtube doesn't publish a lot of information about how it's search rankings work, so I encourage everyone to do their own research and not take my word for it. (To quote LeVar Burton.) I believe very strongly that Youtube is a summer pool with room for everyone, so there's no reason to hide information like this. Hope this has helped you out in some way, Reddit.

They love to talk to me about their games and my games, but I try to avoid it during class because they need to be learning their programming! It's really cool to connect to them in this way. There is a whole load of social boundaries I know I don't want to cross, but thankfully these students understand this too (plus it might be New Zealand culture is a bit more relaxed). They are a great bunch of seniors.

They have been asking for me to play a game with them for a while, and after some time I said why not. They were keen for DOTA 2 which they play a lot of, which is something I've never played before (but watch Northernlion play a lot). I joined about 10 of them one evening on mumble and we played a 5 v 5 and one of the students guided me. I was awful, but in my second game I managed to get a double kill on the two best players on the opposing team. They were very embarrassed after that.

I managed to record the moment, if anyone is keen to watch it.

##[Physical Etiquette]

___


1. Film early or late at night. (Avoid busy times of day and associated noise)

2. Isolate yourself from doorways and windows. Arrange your monitors to block potential noise entryways. Make a sort of cubical that helps prevent background noise.

3. Stop all sources of noise that are in your control. Turn off fans, TVs, and the like. 

4. If you own a desktop mic it is a *very* wise idea for it to not be on the desk you type on. Sound after all, is vibration, and it travels *much* better through solids than air. That desktop mic will pick up those keystrokes not only through the air, but it will be able to feel them quite literally. Also slip a mouse pad under the microphone's base if you can, that is also a viable way to reduce vibration pickup.

5. Test your headphones or headset and ensure the microphone picks up as little game/speaker sound as possible. Find a volume level that allows you to hear the application, but not the microphone itself.

6. You can help reduce echo in your room by purchasing [Acoustic Foam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_foam), or if you are determined not to spend money, drape walls with woolen blankets or the like. The goal is to absorb audio waves and prevent their bouncing tendency. Refer to *DisembodiedDave's* number 4 in the User-Submitted section for more info.

7. Get a [Pop Filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_filter) for your desktop microphone. You may construct your own wind-sock-like device by stretching a porous cloth (like pantyhose) over a diaphragm to help reduce airflow toward your mic.  

9. Keep at least a one foot distance from your sensitive microphones. That is, unless your channel is about heavy breathing. Pop filters and wind socks will not prevent heavy breathing sounds. Please don't creep us all out.

10. Buy a laptop-esq keyboard and quiet clicking mouse. You want your key-presses to be be as silent as possible, as this is how cultured gentlemen prefer their audio. Crisp, quiet, and flowing like a tophat soaked in a fine brandy.

11. You might want to have a push-to-talk setup for your microphone. This prevents unwelcomed guests, arbitrary key-presses, and sneezes from appearing in your audio feed.

##[Software Etiquette]

________

1. [Editor Literacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_editing): Many featured video editing programs provide a whole host of effects to help limit background noise, enhance your voice, and even save your viewers from going deaf! [Sony Vegas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Vegas_Pro) and other video editors such as [Adobe Premiere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Premiere_Pro) have all the below.

2. [Decibel Literacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel): Decibels are the representation of a sound's intensity to the human ear - or that is at least how we refer to it in this specific article. Human speech is around -6db. In your video, you should have your voice range from -6db to just shy of 0db. Anything higher can be extraordinarily uncomfortable to hear for long or even short periods of time.

3. [Multiple Audio Channel Files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave): Split your voice audio and your game audio. *You can't utilize any of the below when your voice is mixed with that tar-pit we call game audio.* Recording applications such as [DXTORY](http://dxtory.com/) do this.

4. [Compressors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_range_compression): This filter will ensure your vocal volume stays within a range higher than silent and below ear-bleeding. If you use any of these filters mentioned in this article, the compressor should be top priority. The last thing anyone wants is their headset blown out, or their bowels emptied by a startling sound. If the later happens, you can almost guarantee that viewer won't be coming back - unless they're into that kind of thing. 

5. [Noise Gates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_gate): Noise gates do what you think they do. They remove all sound under a certain threshold. For me personally, -25db is perfect at limiting keyboard press and other sounds. You may also use [Audacity](http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/Noise_Removal) for noise removal rather easily. This varies from setup to setup, so as always, find your sweet spot!

6. [Equalizers]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equalization_(audio\) ): Personal Example: [Here](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/102186115/Old/Equalizer.jpg).
Equalization is used to add bass and tremble to your voice. If you've heard [Captain Sparklez](http://www.youtube.com/user/CaptainSparklez) voice as well as other famous YouTubers, you may notice their voices have more of an ""ear filling"" sound compared to someone who applies no effects to their voice. Rich voices are extremely beneficial as they keep new viewers pleased with your quality and increase the odds of their subscription and comment.

7. [Maximizers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTk_AT_ccnQ): **YouTube link** Maximizers are basically compressors that keep your voice consistent with a decibel range or specific value. Meaning that if your audio isn't riddled with [artifacts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_artifact) you can keep your voice at a consistent volume with little effort.

8. [Pitch Shifters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_shift): Only shift your voice's pitch by a *small* degree. I'm speaking in [cents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(music\)) of ten to twenty here, no more. Cents cause so small of a pitch change, you won't really notice until you start getting into the plus or minus thirty to forties. **This is not recommended to everyone.**

9. [Mono Audio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural): Mix down or record your voice and game audio in [Mono](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaural). Mono audio has only one sound channel, versus stereo, which has two. For the vast majority of people, stereo is a waste of precious file size and aids to nothing.

10. Ensure your game audio never gets louder than your voice. If you are the focus of your channel, your voice should always win out regardless if an NPC is talking or the entire game world is in the process of being nuked.

##[Practiced Etiquette]

___


1. Avoid shouting into your microphone. It peaks the waveform and makes your voice sound awful. In addition to giving your viewers an earful, it does a poor job at depicting professional vocal quality. You may also cover your expensive microphone in saliva, which does a pretty good job at eroding your microphone's life expectancy and quality over the years. 

2. Don't touch your microphone while recording. The audience doesn't need to hear fumbling and scratching while they are trying to enjoy your quality content.

3. Oil that squeaky chair, or lock it in position. Stay classy YouTube. A squeaky chair is a sure fire way to distract your audience and have them focus on your physical representation rather than your vocal representation. 

4. Every single time you get prepared to start recording, do a test recording of about ten seconds. Check the volume levels of the game and your voice, in addition to making sure the correct devices are being recorded and your files are being saved in the appropriate format. Nothing is worse than recording thirty minutes to an hour of footage only to discover you haven't recorded your studio quality microphone, but your $15 webcam's microphone.

5. Always aim for better quality content. Look back at your videos weekly. Ask yourself if your content is better than what you had before. Does your voice sound *exactly* how you want it? If not, get back on that equalizer and train those vocal-cords!


##[User-Submitted Etiquette]
_____
#[[DisembodiedDave](http://www.reddit.com/user/disembodieddave)] 

1. If you finding you keyboard and mouse are being picked up, try laying a folded towel over your hands while recording. It's actually pretty amazing how much this can reduce the sound. Of course you have to be able to play without ever looking at the keyboard or mouse. 

2. Understand Mic position, aiming, and why it can be so important. If you're finding your recorded voice sounds a bit to bassy or a bit to trebly before you mess with an EQ, try aiming your mic differently. 

3. Knowing the [polar pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone_pick_up_patterns#Microphone_polar_patterns) of your mic is important here. The most common is the Cardioid, and can pick up sounds from the sides of it. Aiming your mic so its facing away from unwanted sounds can solve a lot of problems but also may place the mic in an awkward spot. So Experiment.

4. Each room is different and they all have a background noise. There a couple of ways you can reduce this before recording. Parallel walls a generally a bad thing for recording audio. Try recording with bookshelf, or angled surface behind you. This will help reduce [standing waves.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_waves) 
If all else fails (including post processing), try building a blanket fort (seriously!) around your recording space using heavy blankets. It may sound silly, but it will actually reduce a lot of room noise. This technique is used occasionally in professional recording studios for recording kick drums when a ""tighter,"" cleaner sound is desired. I would only recommend it as a last resort, and you should have the sense to keep your computer tower outside of the fort. 

5. For Push-To-Talk. Invest in a nice gaming mouse that has some extra buttons on it. Like the Razer Naga or Logitech G6000. Then assign one of the extra buttons to your push-to-talk to free up all the fingers you actually use during gaming. 

[[Koonetz]](http://www.reddit.com/user/Koonetz)

* Music production programs are absolutely great for cleaning the voice, once I reduce the noise on audacity I usually try cleaning what's left of the sound by EQ'ing it and compressing it. So if you have Ableton or FL studio I would highly recommend using them. You will want to apply EQ somewhere from 170Hz to 300Hz depending on how bassy it sounds. Only use this if you want absolute flawless quality though, you will spend a lot of time just messing around with the EQ until you find that sweet spot.
For example, I found that adding an Acoustic EQ + another EQ cutting the lows and highs over to my voice made it sound a lot more ""natural"". The difference is crazy when you compare it to the raw file.

1359234469.0,40,self.letsplay,17bzyu,Rethinking my earlier advice on tagging,ItsOppositeDayHere,43,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/17bzyu/rethinking_my_earlier_advice_on_tagging/,"So, almost a year ago I posted [a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/tlfm9/the_importance_of_proper_exhaustive_tagging/) which detailed all of my advice for tagging your videos properly in order to rank as high as possible in searches relevant to your video. The cliffnotes for the post were basically:  

* Tag exhaustively (fill the box with relevant tags) 
* Put important phrases in quotations 
* Use iterations on the name of the game + descriptors (ie. ""DmC"", ""DmC Gameplay"", ""DmC Walkthrough"", ""DmC Let's Play"", etc.)  

After recently doing some research and switching my strategy a bit, I wanted to make another post perhaps correcting myself or, at the very least, tempering my enthusiasm with my old model. This post doesn't necessarily have any definitive advice; it's more food for thought and, as always, discussion is absolutely encouraged (especially if you have evidence to back it up!)  

**Does tagging exhaustively actually *hurt* you?**  

The whole genesis for this thread came from my experiences last week after producing a review and first impressions type video for DmC. I tagged these videos exhaustively using the methods detailed in my earlier post and was disappointed to find that I ranked somewhat poorly. In order to re-evaluate my strategy somewhat to see if the reason for my poor ranking was due to improper tagging, I decided to take a look at the tags for the video in first for ""DmC"", which is theRadBrad's Let's Play. The tags are as follows:  

&gt;DMC, Devil May Cry, Devil May Cry 5, DMC Devil May Cry, Gameplay, Walkthrough, Mission, Ending, Review, Playthrough, Let&amp;#39;s Play, Commentary, Guide  

(You can see a video's tags by right-clicking the page then ""View Page Source"". Keep in mind that copying another video's tags verbatim is a TOS violation)

As you can see, in contrast to my method, TRB has used a smaller number of specific tags (hard to say definitively because you can't see past a certain character limit, but anyway) in favor of a few specific tags followed by some general ones.  

Now, it's worth noting two things here. The first is that a lot of factors  affect search traffic including time watched, views, likes (AFAIK), the title and description, and so on. So, it's impossible to isolate the tags as the factor that made TRB rank so well since he also has a huge following and the video is well supported. Secondly, some other high ranking YTers (GhostRobo for example) seem to tag more similar to my earlier method while still being reasonably successful.  

Still, this observation persuaded me to try some new tagging strategies of my own just to see how it affects things.  

**My (Anecdotal) Experience**  

To test this new method, I decided to use my newest series on The Cave. Episode 1 of The Cave is tagged as such (my old method):  

&gt;the cave, the cave walkthrough, cave walkthrough, the cave gameplay, the cave video, the cave strategy guide, the cave review, the cave double fine, double f..  

While Episode 2 is tagged like so:  

&gt;the cave, cave gameplay, double fine, ron gilbert, tim schafer, sega, walkthrough, the cave walkthrough, northernlion, playthrough, gameplay, commentary, vid...  

So, the second one is much more general and uses terms that, while relevant to the game, aren't simply iterations on ""The Cave + [descriptor]"".  

Now, usually for a series (in my experience), Part 1 ranks the highest, perhaps because it usually has the highest views, likes, comments, time watched (etc.) However, here are the results for The Cave so far. 

[Exhibit A](http://i.imgur.com/gtydQqA.png) and [Exhibit B](http://imgur.com/ZkGVmf4)  

As you can see, Part 2 ranks #2 overall for ""The Cave"" while Part 1 sits much lower on the first page (somewhere around #11, I think) despite being more substantially more popular as of the time of this writing. Note that I did this search on IE (I use Chrome exclusively) while signed out, but it's totally possible that cookies could have affected my search rankings one way or the other.  

However, if these results are consistent, it does seem to suggest that more sparse and general tagging (with a few specific tags at the start) may actually improve search rankings compared to the more exhaustive tagging that I previously recommended.  

**Conclusion and tl;dr** 

It's important as always to take this with a grain of salt as it's only one man's opinion and experience, but it's interesting to note the results I saw. Perhaps my earlier recommended of tagging is short-sighted and, as always, I recommend you experiment on your own to find what works best for you and your videos!

Hey guys, I've been a fan of LP's (good ones, that is!) for awhile and eventually ended up making a few. Long story short, I realized I kinda sucked at them... so a friend and I decided we'd be better off making a site dedicated solely to LP-videos.

This site took a ton of work and there's more we'd like to add, but right now it acts complimentary to Youtube. You can sync with Youtube, add entire playlists from Youtube, etc. but with the increased focused and organization of a dedicated site.

The site is the result of the two us addressing a lot of complaints from LP'ers, as well as trying to streamline the process of adding videos and create a more focused community than the chaos of Youtube.

**1. Always On** So, you've been doing LP's for a good chunk of time now! Maybe you've been posting consistently for a couple weeks, months, or years.

""It's a bad idea to have dead air in your commentary. People feel awkward and they'll stop being engrossed if they notice dead air!""

As true as this may be, a new person isn't going to know how to constantly talk, while still being interesting. Remember, you're experienced, and they're not. Get down to human, empathetic levels. People aren't dumb, but they're not ""in the circle"". Instead of (or in addition to) ""don't leave dead air in your videos"" try ""talk about what you know and like"".

Not all dead air is the end of your channel and reputation. Granted, too much dead air is indeed distracting. However, that doesn't mean you have to constantly always have something in your mind to talk about. It can be detrimental to do that, in my own experience. There will come a time when you won't have anything, and in your struggle to ""always be on"", you'll end up making nonsense. You'll begin ideas that have no business being discussed. Dead air doesn't mean start talking about your lunch. If you start an idea just because you have to, it wont be a genuine idea. Often, it wont even be an interesting idea. So many new people start off with this advice and talk about nothing. Sure, there's no dead air... but we as viewers don't CARE about what you have to say in this situation... And it makes us leave your video to find something actually interesting to us.

So, to combat the nonsense babble of always being on as a newcomer... Realize your commentary will be bad. It will. Unless you're a naturally outgoing person, have taken improv/acting classes, or some other outside factor where you actually experience performing for, or in front of people... your commentary will be bad. Even with those past skills, doing LP's is its own beast. Your first commentaries will be bad. Deal with it and move on.

Now that you're not worried (hopefully) about doing your commentary ""right"", you can be natural. In my own experience, being natural is the best course of action. If you're not naturally funny, don't try to be. Go with what you're good at. If you're a super casual gamer who doesn't like the sound of their own voice, try making a video just playing your game with no commentary. People will watch.

If you're naturally funny, charismatic, loud, quiet, energetic, sarcastic, satirical, or whatever it may be... great! Variety is the spice of life. Not every LP has to be funny. Not every LP has to make fun of the game on screen. They don't all need commentary, they don't all need to be constantly engaging and hyper-engrossing. If you're having fun, we'll have fun.

**2. Views and Subs** Hey, alright! You've just reached 1,000 subs, and want to thank your fans and community! The short answer to this is keep it brief/don't. Making a big deal over your subs and views places even greater pressure on newcomers to get more subs/views.

If people start LP'ing with the intent of having lots of subs, views, and ad revenue... we begin to have low quality content pushers who aren't enjoying what they do, selling us time wastes, with the expectancy of fame and glory. Not fun for anyone. Not fun for the viewers, and not fun for the creators.

Placing less emphasis on high numbers helps to relieve the pressure of achieving those numbers. If you're excited about your numbers, that's perfectly fine. Just be mindful to not instill false hopes in people who have no business LP'ing. It's not for everyone just like acting and being on stage isn't for everyone.

And complaining about not having views helps no one. The vast majority of content creators don't get many views. Cry us all a river.  We're all in the same boat.

If you worry about views and subs, you're focusing on the wrong aspects. Those numbers rise when you stop focusing on them. Enjoy yourself and gain experience in your craft.

**3. Just be Yourself** Ok, here's the advice everyone hears. Hell, I've already talked about it in this post. That's how prevalent this advice is. And it's hypocritical of me to give that advice, then say what I'm about to say.

Not everyone knows who they are when it comes to LP'ing. At least not at the start. As I said earlier, variety is the spice of life. LP's can, and should, vary in style. If you don't know your style, don't fret. No one did at the start. Start experimenting and figure things out as you go. Just because many LP'ers are funny, it doesn't mean you should too. Sure, being funny helps. Laughing puts people in a good mood! But not everything has to incite raucous joviality.

When was the last time the Olympics were funny? Was that amazing play you watched over the weekend funny from start to finish? Did that movie have you falling out of your chair clutching your sides?

Rhetorical questions aside, not everything has to be funny. If being funny isn't you, that's no problem at all. Keep trying stuff to find what you actually are. If it turns out you're an amazing editor with impeccable comedic timing in post, but not in the hot seat, tailor your videos to feed on your editing. If you have a keen eye for detail in games, build on that skill and show us secrets of the game, glitches, or special things that only someone with experience could pull off. If you're a pro, show us with an intense fight we couldn't hope to survive as easily as you.

If you don't know what your niche is, explore and find it. Don't get corralled into a genre you don't fit. As they say... be yourself. Once you find it.

**4. Technical Difficulties** This section is kind of moot in a weird way.

Remember that not everyone has a top of the line computer, or money to spend on a mic any better than a cheap headset. There are plenty of free or cheap products extensively listed on this subreddit and on many a website. If someone is new, it's quite likely their video/audio quality will be below some people's standards. It's super common, and questions to fix it are just as popular.

For experienced LP'ers, point people in the direction of professionals who are courteous. If you're on that list of professionals, great. Advise away. If you're not someone as confident in tech specs, don't go handing out advice on what to buy. Don't tell other people what to spend their money on if you don't know the whole situation. Just because one product worked for you, doesn't mean it'll help everyone. Instead, show people where they CAN get the information. Let them make informed decisions, providing they can find the information.

And as for inexperienced LP'ers, always get a second, third, or fourth opinion. Read reviews on everything. Sleep on it. Look again tomorrow. Exhaust your outlets. Get as much information as you can. Information is everywhere. If you're strapped for cash, but intend on spending money for LP'ing, make triple sure you're buying the thing that will work for you. With hundreds of mics of varying types and configurations, there's a lot to consider. Don't make a purchase off one person's advice. Maybe you don't want a Blue Snowball mic. If you've got an echo'y room, or a mechanical keyboard, you will probably want a shotgun mic instead of a diaphragm mic. And if you don't know what those terms mean... educate yourself. Wikipedia it. Make informed decisions.

Just remember that not everyone can or will have studio quality hardware. It's just a fact of life. We don't watch your videos just because they're crisp and clear. We watch for the personality behind the high definition. We also watch the personalities behind low definition. Provided your viewer isn't distracted by your tech, we really don't care too much.

**5. In Conclusion** In conclusion...? Just have fun. If LP'ing isn't fun, don't do it. You wont enjoy it, and we wont enjoy your videos.
If there's too much to focus on, relax. If you don't have anything to say, don't. Get your thoughts in order before you let something dribble out of your mouth and into our ears. We don't want your verbal drool. If you start doing LP's with the intention of higher and bigger numbers, you're in it for the wrong reasons. Stop worrying about it so much. It's playing video games. Just play the game and enjoy yourself.



Now, is it possible I'm talking out my ass? Absolutely. In reality, you shouldn't give a fuck what I, or anyone else thinks of your videos. Doing it for the approval of others is a selfish and unsubstantiated reason to LP. Of course, LP'ing in an attempt to entertain people is totally fine. So long as you aren't bogged down by all of the stigma surrounding the genre of entertainment.

**TL;DR: Experienced LP'ers; remember to empathize with newbies.
Newbies; just be a person until you develop into an experienced LP'er.**

1352300065.0,32,self.letsplay,12srd3,My 2 Cents for new LP'ers!,preferNERD,35,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/12srd3/my_2_cents_for_new_lpers/,"Hello everyone!

Thank you for taking the time to read my post!  I thought I would share a little bit about LP'ing and hopefully help at least one person.  A little background on myself, I've been LP'ing for almost a whole year now.  I've read different guides on LP'ing but honestly, there isn't a clear cut style...just be yourself and have fun!  Here are a couple of points/thoughts I'd like to make:

* **Have Fun!** - I made this point above but, it's probably the most important.  If you aren't having fun while making your videos...what's the point?  The main reason you should be making a LP is because you enjoy the aspect of making a video.  Playing a video game and sharing it with everyone is **AWESOME!**

* **Audio &amp; Video Quality Matter** - Quality is very important, it's the first thing people see/hear when they come and watch your video.  Having a decent setup is important.  I'm not going to go into depth as to setting up your audio and video settings.  But, I'll try to point you in the right direction.

&gt; Video - How will the world see you play that **awesome** game?  You need to capture your game play obviously!  I recommend using the program [Dxtory](http://dxtory.com/v2-home-en.html), however there are tons of great programs like [FRAPS](fraps.com), [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html), and much more!  If you're recording game play on a console, you'll need a different recording device.

I'll try to make a separate post on this at a later date.

&gt; Audio - **DON'T OVERLOOK AUDIO QUALITY!** Audio is super important and is relatively easy to setup.  You'll need to make sure you have a quality microphone...you don't need a top of the line microphone like a Snowball or Yeti, you can get a microphone on the cheap, usually for less than $20!

[Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) is your friend! Learn to use it, it's such a powerful tool! It's your one-stop-shop when it comes to recording your voice for your LP!  

Again, I'll try to make a separate post on audio set-up in a later post!

* **Consistency** - Staying consistent is something I WISH someone told me when I started doing LP's!  **STICK TO A SCHEDULE** ... whether it's once a week, twice a week, once a day...**STAY CONSISTENT!!!**  AND MAKE SURE YOUR SCHEDULE IS POSTED ON YOUR CHANNEL!  

If you can...try to post around the same time each day!  It may not help much in the beginning, but after uploading at the same time for months...your subscriber base will know what to expect from you!

* **Content of the Video** - On to the meat of your videos...the CONTENT!  I can write so much here...but this section will be a little different for everyone!  Try to make yourself different from other LP'ers!  That'll help you stand out.  **Try not to be repetitive**, this is tricky...but you'll become accustomed to this after a while!

* **Video Title/Tags** - Oh the NERDY stuff of the video making process! **KEYWORDS!**  Naming your videos and using the correct keywords will help your video rank higher in Youtube's searching algorhythm.  *While this isn't the only factor in searching for your videos*...it definitely helps!  Here is how I name my videos:
&gt; **Game Name** - **Title of Episode** - **Part ___**
For example, I'm currently playing Donkey Kong Country.  So my most recent episode is, 
&gt; **Donkey Kong Country** - **Woodchuck!** - **Part 2**
I do this for a variety of reasons, when a person searches Youtube...they normally search for the game name and then a variety of other things:
*A LP'ers name, Something that happened in the game (boss fight, etc.), or a tip*
**The more times you mention something, as long as it's relevant, in your TITLE, DESCRIPTION, &amp; TAGS, the higher it ranks.**
Normally the Youtube can come up with some GREAT tags for your video.  But, include things like your name, things that happened in the video, and anything else relevant. 
**This could be a whole post in itself...but don't underestimate the power of the Title and Tags!**

There is more when it comes it making a video and I just scratched the surface.  Things that I didn't cover is the whole **promotion** aspect of your video.  I believe Social Media helps!  It may not prove beneficial right away, but it can help!

I hope this helped a couple of people and hopefully I didn't ramble on too long!  I wish you the best of luck in your Youtube endeavors!  And, if you have any questions, feel free to contact me on my:

1358094951.0,32,self.letsplay,16hv49,"Calculating your content's *true* worth, and learning the difference between RPM and CPM! -- Important discussion for all those considering a Network partnership.",JonPaula,39,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/16hv49/calculating_your_contents_true_worth_and_learning/,"Prompted by a conversation I had with **allcapsarelocked**, and others in the past few months on this SubReddit, it occurs to me that many people are confused as to what their content makes per 1,000 views. So here's a quick - *and crucial* education for everyone!

**Example image / quick version**: http://imgur.com/z33Bi

* Don't confuse CPM with RPM! ""Cost per thousand"" represents the *total* cost sold on the video, 45% of which goes to YouTube directly, and never makes it to your bank account. Whereas RPM = ""revenue per thousand"" (it's originally from the Greek ""mile"", which meant 1,000) is the number YOU receive. It's important to learn the difference, as a Network Contract might offer you a ""$5 CPM"", but again, you'll never see more than ~55% of such a figure. 

* Ignore Google Adsense's numbers/reports. I've been earning a living from YouTube for five years now, and I *still* don't understand what any of that ""Page CTR"" shit means. Those numbers are incomplete, don't factor in your ""YouTube earnings"", and only focus on specific ads. Instead...

* **USE ANALYTICS**: Select a time range (Networks are fond of looking at 6-month averages to gage a channel's general success over time), and take the **""Total Estimated Earnings""** figure. Then, divide this by... 

* **""Estimated Monetized Playbacks""**, which you'll find on the far right of the ""Ad Performance"" tab -- this is the truest and most accurate assessment of your content (more so than ""monetized views"" or regular views) -- as it counts each and every *ad impression*, which is especially critical to LPers, as many of us use multiple advertisements per video (a pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll in a 24 minute upload, for example). 

* Take this figure, and **multiple by 1,000**. That number, likely in the $4 - $10 range, (determined by many factors, including number of ads served, type of content, metadata, time of the year, etc.) represents your TRUE RPM. That is what your content is worth, *especially* so if you calculate over a six-month span, or longer... as individual videos in a short-time period aren't necessarily an accurate measure of your success, especially during the Holiday Season when ad prices spike.

* For those (like me, sometimes) too lazy to do the math, try the http://www.clickz.com/cpm-calculator to calculate your RPM totals, or work the formula in reverse if you're trying to see what a Network's flat-rate of $3.00 would get you, for example. All networks that offer a ""flat-rate"" calculate your revenue based on ""Estimated Monetized Playbacks"" - not views.


**TL;DR**: In YouTube analytics, divide ""Total Estimated Earnings"" by ""Estimated Monetized Playbacks"", and then multiple by 1,000 to get your true RPM -- Compare this to a Network's offer, and **negotiate**! -- Good luck, and let me know if you have questions!

[You can get the new layout on your channel here. Don't blame me if you hate it](http://www.youtube.com/onechannel)

**Channel Art** 

Custom backgrounds are gone but you can customize your channel by uploading a custom banner (http://gyazo.com/77d17881859e839682dfa9618aba1dd2.png?1362764599) Recommended size is 2120x1192 and you can add your Twitter/FB/Twitch (etc.) links to the banner automatically from your channel page, which is nice. 

**Sections** 

Below your featured video/channel trailer (which I'll talk about later) is an area for *sections* (http://gyazo.com/77f986c6bfff0fe2816042174cd7dd4d) which you will use to organize your videos. In the old layout you had the option to arrange your playlists in whatever order you want, but sections offers a lot more flexibility. Each one of the rows you see in the picture is an individual 'section', so as you can see you can still do individual playlists if you want, but there's also built-in options for popular uploads, recent uploads, live events (in the unlikely event you stream on YouTube) and many other criteria. You can even create sections based on tags, if you want, which will display all videos with a specific tag. 

Overall, I like sections a lot and I think it allows a lot more flexibility in creating a useful channel layout that actually displays valuable information. 

**Channel Trailer**  

One of the new features I was excited for was the ability to make a channel trailer (http://gyazo.com/719c8dff2e1c3007c4617cdee5cb2180) that only shows up to channel visitors who are unsubscribed. This way, subscribers aren't pestered but you still have a good way to (tastefully, hopefully) encourage new visitors to follow your channel automatically. You can see my first crack at a [channel trailer here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVa1etOBRCk). I whipped it up in like a half hour last night and there's some objective problems with it, but overall it accomplished what I wanted: short(ish), explains what I do and why I think that provides value, and encouraged people to subscribe without begging. It's too early to tell how it's been working but my subscription rate hasn't dropped precipitously or anything (nor has it risen significantly either) so it's likely the layout isn't a total catastrophe overall.  

I'm sure we'll see some really cool stuff with channel trailers as well as some really deplorable stuff, but only time will tell.  

**Overall Tips**  

*Keep in mind I've only had the layout for the day and that's not enough time to gather good data. These are just my hunches, thoughts.* 

* Upload your channel trailer as ""unlisted"" and in Advanced Settings uncheck 'notify subscribers' if you don't want existing fans to be bothered by your trailer upload.  

* I would recommend fleshing out the ""About"" section on your channel. With the new layout showing the ""About"" tab fairly prominently (http://gyazo.com/be18e3d40873d0bdfd09ad73ff62e271), my guess is that it's going to be a lot more well-trafficked. The section is also more conducive to more detail now that it's not jammed in the sidebar IMO. 

Well, that's all I've really got for now. Feel free to offer your tips, ask questions, or discuss the layout in general here.

ProtonJon and raocow both acknowledged this in their videos eventually.  Raocow finished the game but I think ProtonJon stopped playing after he found out.  Not a huge surprise, but sort of upsetting nonetheless.

Apologies if this is a repost, I haven't noticed it in the sub.  Just thought I'd share as it's an interesting letsplay story.

A Super Mario World romhack called [Notte Luminsoa](http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=showhack&amp;id=3716) was created by user [Yanama](http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&amp;id=2794) (a teenager according to his profile) back in 2010.

Yanama recently [posted](http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&amp;t=60641&amp;page=1&amp;pid=988079#p988079) about his battle with leukemia and said that his doctors had given him just short while longer to live.  He also said this:

&gt; My one regret is that Notte Luminosa never got Let's Played by someone worth a damn (read: anyone). So someone get on that. Or not. Not like I'll get to see it, anyways.

As a result, both [raocow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR29hv9jDVo) and [ProtonJon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3lqb5tE5Ag&amp;feature=plcp) are playing the hack in their channels.

I'm not a member of the SMWCentral community so I don't really know much about Yanama.  I obviously can't confirm whether he's actually dying of leukemia, but I find it interesting that two prominent LP'ers have decided to grant his wish and show off his game.

Incidentally, from watching raocow's LP, the game is actually quite good so far.

&gt; I've been hearing a lot of talk about this, and I think it's only right if I throw in my two cents about it. Being positive here and not attacking anybody-- I'd really, really like it if we all started acting like a community again. Is there any reason not to? I've been a part of some community streams, such as CrystalStarStudio's or MasaeAnela's in the past months and it was seriously fun. I intend on doing more things like it too. It seems like so few group efforts or projects centered around simple fun exist now. Stuff's always more fun with friends, so why not work with them on videos or streams? Get together for a weekend over Skype, broadcast on stream, and maybe raise money for charity?

&gt; Wanting to work with friends was how TheRunawayGuys was started, and it's why we have tons of people, big and small, in our tournaments. Cross-promo works, it pays to work together. Can we stop treating making game commentary like a competition? I'm not saying you have to be friends with everyone or even like everyone, but I'm sure you'll find it more enjoyable to make videos when it's about fun and working together, not about getting attention. ""It's the only way to get attention"" isn't a good reason for cutting off from others, nor is it a good core to shape your content around. Heck, if I was hungry for as much attention as possible, I wouldn't have Let's Played Okamiden. There's people in the community who have met with success that didn't rely on that mindset to get where they are. It isn't the only way, and this doesn't have to be a competition, unless you want it to be.

&gt;This community is one of the greatest things I've had in my life. I've made more friends than I can count from it, and I feel like the core values to it may be fading. I don't want that to happen. Even if you don't like me or don't want to link to this post, you can still speak about the core statement if you agree with it. Don't attack people with words, speak through actions. Positive actions. Reach out to old friends who make videos or want to make videos, you know, the ones you've been meaning to talk to again. Nothing's stopping you. Collaborate. Be constructive. Have fun. Smile, since that never hurts. Is that too much to ask?

You might get a comment or two, but nothing much.  What are some ways that we could get to know each other better?

I think that it would be extremely rewarding for us to play stuff together and meet other LP'ers.  Collaborations are always interesting, and if you already know other people from the community it would be easier to do stuff like that.  You'll see a bit of crossover from your fan bases, which is cool, and a lot of people are just more interesting with somebody to talk to!  It seems like a bad idea to have a collaboration with somebody you barely know, though, as you may not end up getting along.

So, does anyone else think this would be cool?  Any ideas of how to bring us all together are welcome!  We could have a minecraft server, or all play TF2 together, or even just chat once in a while.

What do you all think?  I'd love to meet you!

I just thought I would take a second to mention the use of the flair on this subreddit! I'm not a mod or anything; I've just noticed that many people on here are still not using the flair option to show off their channels.

If you haven't already, I suggest taking a look at the right of the page. Check ""Show my flair on this reddit."" Once you have that checked, go to ""edit"" next to your username underneath. Select the option that has the White/Red YouTube logo next to your name, then type in your channel and press save. I suggest typing in the format ""http://www.youtube.com/USERNAME"". It makes it much easier to highlight the flair and quickly get to your channel rather than having to search the username on YouTube!

I almost always look at someone's channel if they comment on a thread of mine or I see them around often enough. The flair is a good way of allowing people to visit your channel if they want to!

You're not alone.,kirbyviper93,30,3,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/x2uie/dont_feel_confident_in_your_commentary_youre_not/,"One of the complaints that I hear most often from LPers, new and old alike, is that they don't feel that their commentary is as strong as it could be. This could be for any number of reasons; they don't like the sound of their voice, they seem to have trouble thinking on their feet, what have you. In particular, a friend of mine was talking about looking into improv classes to help out with his commentary.

Now that got me thinking, why not extend that opportunity to anyone else who might like to try it?

I don't claim to be the most experienced in the area of improv. I was, however, involved in theater and drama for several years growing up, and feel that I could confidently lead a small group of people in a Skype-based improv class for Let's Players! As a large part of traditional improv is physical, there's only so much we can do, but there are still a few exercises that can help with one's spontaneity, creativity, ability to express emotion, and the give-and-take that's required when playing a game.

So my question to you, r/letsplay, is this: **Is anyone interested in sitting in on a Skype-based improv group designed for Let's Players?** If so, please let me know what areas specifically you'd like to focus on!

A word of caution; if you ARE interested, prepare to be goofy as fuck. Improv is about letting go of your inhibitions and saying whatever comes to mind.

1323083644.0,27,self.letsplay,n104x,How to Grow Your Audience on YouTube (tips),ItsOppositeDayHere,35,8,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/n104x/how_to_grow_your_audience_on_youtube_tips/,"I see a lot of people on /r/LetsPlay lamenting how difficult it is to get their videos noticed on YouTube among the tens of thousands of other LPers out there. It sucks putting a lot of time into your videos and only having a few people watch them, and a lot of the time on YouTube it really feels like it's impossible to break out of that early phase where nobody knows who you are because bigger names dominate the search rankings for pretty much every game.  

Now, my channel is by no means huge compared to some (20k subs, 6M views), but over the past year or so I've come up with a lot of very simple tips to finding and maintaining an audience that might prove useful to channels just starting out.  

Feel free to add your own tips/ask questions!

**Getting Noticed**

* Make sure your title is in clear, sensible English (or whatever language you choose). Nice titles are more appealing than messy, confusing ones.   

* Tag, tag, tag. If you don't take the time to tag your videos properly, you're missing out on a potentially huge audience due to search traffic.  Put search strings in quotation marks, ie. ""Super Meat Boy"" instead of just *super meat boy*. Type the name of your game into the YouTube search bar to see what common searches for that game are, and add relevant ones to your tags (ie. *""super meat boy walkthrough""*, *""super meat boy gameplay""*). Proper tagging improves search ranking. Even if it only brings an extra 10 viewers a day, that adds up over a few months and across dozens of videos.  

**Technical Stuff**  

* If you want to grow your channel beyond a few hundred subscribers, you need **good audio and video quality**. This doesn't mean you need to be in HD or have a $200 condenser mic, but your video, voice, and game audio should all be as clear as possible. Additionally, your voice should be high enough above the game audio that people can easily understand your commentary without straining. This is of utmost importance. Ask for feedback on /r/LP if you're concerned.

**Keeping an Audience** 

* **Keep a consistent upload schedule**. Decide how many videos you're upload every day/week, what times you're going to upload them, and then **stick to it.** This is, IMO, the most important tip for making sure your audience continues to watch your videos. Freddiew has a great quote, ""a consistent audience requires consistent content"". That doesn't mean you have to upload 20 videos a week. Even if you're only going to do 3 (or 1), make sure you let your audience know they can rely on you to put those videos up every M/W/F and they'll come back to watch them.  

* All videos in a series should have the same (or very similar) tags to make sure they show up in the related videos sidebar for one another. About 25% of my total views come from people clicking a video on that sidebar; nothing to sneeze at.  

* Interact with your audience. Got a few viewers who comment on every video? Make sure to reply to their comments now and then so they know you appreciate it. If your channel is big enough, start a Twitter/Facebook for it so you can interact with them more directly. Help them out when they have questions, answer their messages, etc. Eventually it becomes impossible to do this for everybody, but it feels good and lets your fans (no matter how few) know how much you appreciate them.  

* You can also use social media channels to distribute/promote new videos.  

* Practice good channel maintenance. This means, primarily, that you should make playlists for your series and keep them up to date. Also keep in mind that you can change your ""Featured Video"" on your channel to highlight a new video/series.

**Networking**  

* One of the things I've noticed since the Together to the Top movement started is a huge increase in box-for-boxing (putting a channel in your ""Other Channels"" box in exchange for the same from the other person). There's nothing wrong with this but **box-for-boxing is worthless unless you get a lot of channel views**. I get around 5k channel views a day and probably only add a few subscribers every day to the channels in my box. If you're getting &lt;1,000, that only adds up to a few subscribers a week. It's a waste of time to send messages to people asking for box-for-box unless you (or they) are a relatively big channel.  

* Sub-for-sub is even worse. It does nothing but inflate your subscriber count and it makes you look like a tool when you have 5k subscribers but your videos get 100 views each.  

* The best form of networking for small-medium sized channels is to actually get down and dirty and **do collaborations**. Find someone you like who is around the same size, make some videos together and promote each other within the videos. Assuming you do it in a non-sleazy way, you can not only get a boost in audience but make some great content doing it. 

**Turning Viewers into Subscribers**

Here begins the stuff that might be perceived by some people as slightly game-y, because it involves using things like annotations to encourage people to subscribe. I believe that calls-to-action (asking people to subscribe) are perfectly fine as long as they're tastefully done and not in your face. Here are some I use.  

* I put a small annotation with my channel name and an embedded link to subscribe in the top-right/bottom-right corner of every video. Keep it small and out of the way so it doesn't obstruct anything.  

* In my video descriptions, *after* a description of the episode, I include a block of text that looks something like this:  

 &gt; Subscribe to My Channel  
   Link  
   Watch the whole [Game] Playlist  
   Link  
   Follow me on Twitter  
   Link  
  Follow me on Facebook  
   Link  

By using these subtle calls-to-action, I've gone from gaining ~30 subscribers a day to over 100. This isn't a matter of 'gaming' people into subscribing, it's a matter of reminding repeat viewers that there's a really easy way to find your content as soon as it's uploaded.

UPDATE: Holy Shit, that's a big response, ok so it decidedly ""ON"". 
I made a Steam group for the event ( Anyone only able to play on console will need to form a second event, sorry :C )
Group Name: r/Letsplayers
URL: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rLetsplayers

Its a public group so anyone is free to join, ill post the event through here since its alot easier than a post every time it happens. Plus i'll make it a weekly thing so if you miss out don't worry. It will be a rotation of games throughout the night so if you dont have one game, you can jump in later.
Here's the event info so far (subject to change)

Starting Friday 11pm EST

11pm - 1am= Team Fortress 2//
1am - 3am= CS: GO//
3am - 5am= League of Legends//
5am - whenever we fall asleep = Q &amp; A

Q &amp; A= time at the end of the night where players can relax with whichever game they please and ask any questions they might have for the other members.

Rules:
1. Don't advertise your channel unless its requested, even then only PM the link to them.//
2. No Trolling or Hateful comments directed at other players ( Sarcasm is always allowed )//
3. Credit those involved if you make a video of it.//
4. This is a party, not a pissing contest, don't take losing seriously and have fun.

There ya go, everything is all set. Also you do not HAVE to join the steam group to play, it just make it easier to remember and plan for kbai.

It's up to him if he wants to continue posting it himself, he has first dibs :P, if he doesn't I'll find a replacement.

1. Nominate channels
2. Vote for channel of the month
3. Show that channel some serious love through feedback and constructive criticism, likes, favorites, comments and subs.

Pet peeves, where the community can improve, how to trim the fat without leaving content dry, etc.


As I browse LP's in my spare time, I've been getting more and more cynical. Things like: 


Intros on EVERY video, especially in a series, especially dubstep intros. 


An old or on-board mic doesn't bother me, but if your commentary fuzzes in with in-game dialogue and sound, you NEED to work on your sound mixing.


Facecam in any non-horror LP is frivolous, if not actively bad, as you've obscured the view of your footage.


If you want to commentate, but can't seem to say much... bring in someone else to talk to! It's fun to hear people converse and ball-bust.


I hear some people say that ""going off topic"" is a bad thing, but I say run with it. Tangents fill holes and can go great places. There should be a point where the topic-at-hand should come back in, but people don't need to strong-arm themselves into something they don't want to discuss.


I understand the demand to make 15 minute videos, but if you plan on LPing a JRPG... don't do this. They are story driven. I don't want to see 1/10 of an arc. Shoot for 30 minutes and try to pace their release more frequently so that they are easier to follow. (Drove me batty when sgblikestoplay did that with FF4.)

Among those rules is one that says that posting your Let's Play videos must be done with self.posts and not direct links - otherwise they will more likely be removed by the moderation - and a lot of people have not been following this one in the last few weeks.

Please, remember to follow the rules to help to reduce clutter in the subreddit and make sure that your own submission is seen by others.

That being said, I would like to discuss what I think has been an *elephant in the room* of this subreddit for quite sometime, and is an unfortunate, fundamental issue of this community as a whole:

Every day in /r/letsplay, dozens of new playlist updates are posted. However, there are many times of day when, despite there being an average of ~20 to ~45 active users on at any given time, nobody is commenting on or even taking a look at any of the new Let's-Plays (some of which are *exceptionally* well-made) that are being posted here. Take a brief scroll through the new submissions, and more often than not, you'll find a ghost town of 0 comment posts. This, too, can be viewed as ""video-dumping"", and deleting any playlist-updates that are posted as direct links will do little to stop it; vast numbers of users will still create text-based playlist updates for their respective channels once or more every week, and then leave without so much as a trace, not even bothering to comment on anyone else's material.

Then you have the ""feedback threads"" that popup from time to time in /new/, which in a way often feel like glorified video-dumps unto their own. Here, a user will ask other LPers to submit a video or playlist of their own creation, and promise to provide every video posted a healthy helping of constructive criticism. The problem with this, however, is that many of these threads become nothing more than a place for the OP to discreetly plug their own channel, other users to drop off their videos, and where the advice offered goes little beyond just ""Increase the volume of your voice"".

The point I am trying to make here this: Users are encouraged to submit their Let's-Plays and comment on other people's Let's-Plays; most of the time, though, users will simply post an update, not look at any of the other submissions others are making, and wonder why they are not getting any new viewers or feedback on their own channel; as a result, some of these LPers will eventually give up posting here and move on to other communities, or worse: drop their channel altogether, as is unfortunately the case sometimes. So in the end, we are still essentially drowning in a sea of video-dumps, even though these dumps are seemingly legitimate text-based playlist updates.

Once again, I must stress that I think this is in no way a bad community: I've met plenty of people here who have offered me useful advice and introduced me to many awesome new channels. I simply think that this is a *mislead* community; feedback threads and text-based posts will do little to stop the inevitable sea of post-and-go users that arrive at this subreddit everyday. There needs to be something more to this community in order to diminish this, and to build a better sense of...well, *community.*

Phew... sorry about the wall of text, but anyways: what do you guys think of all of this? In what ways can we try to improve the underlying structure of this community, in ways that will more effectively counteract post-and-go submitters and overall be more beneficial to this subreddit?

**TL;DR:** Forcing users to submit playlist-updates as text posts won't stop the endless number of come-and-go users, who will only post their own playlist updates and never bother to contribute to the community in other ways; we need more effective methods of counteracting this, and ones that will subsequently improve this community drastically as a result. Also, feedback threads feel like glorified video-dumps: if you're looking for constructive criticism on your videos, *Feedback Friday* posts are the place to start.

----

This project is very simple. You make a video, with a duration of less than ten seconds, that summarises the spirit of your channel.

You upload the video to mediafire or filedropper or whatever, and along with your channel details, post it in a comment here.

I download the clips, compile them into a video with some basic editing, and upload it when it's done after the deadline next week.

I'm very realistic about what a pain in the ass this is going to be to get done, but I'm committed to keeping the project as simple and accessible as possible.

This means that aside from the stuff that goes without saying (intentionally offensive junk, copyrighted junk, extremely poorly produced junk) there are no rules for what you choose to do with your ten seconds.

**Logistics and stuff**

----

Closing date for submissions: **March 20th, 2013**

That's a week from now, if you can't make a 10 second video in a week, that's generally concerning.

If you want more time, please feel free to make your own collaboration with blackjack and hookers, and watch as it never gets done because you're loose with deadlines.

Everyone's channel names (including links) will be listed in the description, in order of appearance as a form of credits.

I won't touch anything within your 10 seconds, I might put some titles in between.

**Technical Junk**

----

To keep things looking consistent, use the following settings when encoding your footage

- 10 seconds or less in length

- 720p (if you're using 4:3 footage, there will be black bars. I don't notice them at all, others really, really hate them)

- 25fps (Higher is fine, but will be a bit of a waste)

- LESS THAN 100MB in size (This is a hard limit, thx)

- Shoot for around -6dB across your audio. Make sure it never clips. If it's too quiet I'll have to turn it up for you, and it will sound bad.

- No weird-ass file types (I'm not going to download a codec to import your soviet-era footage)

- If you choose to use music over your clip, avoid having it right at the start and end, and fade it in/out if possible. It'll be jarring between clips if you don't.

- **Please use your channel as your file's name. I've had to rename at least 5 '10s thing' clips already.**

**Goals**

----

This project's aim is to celebrate Let's Playing as a genre, and make this community a more productive, tightly knit and productive environment. Did I mention productive?

To be entirely clear: this project is not intended to increase anyone's exposure or sub count. Please don't expect anything out of this, the exception being what you put in. 

Once again, because I know subs are heroin for us folks. There is no promotional plan for making this video, it's by us and for us as a community to put on the shelf.

This is simply an exercise for the community and a proof of concept for future collaborations, so that we might set a precedent for more productive and exciting work.

**Regarding Your Submission**

----

Be creative! No one wants to watch 20 vlogs of geeky dudes talking into a webcam for 10 seconds each. Use a combination of your old clips, gameplay footage, drawings and footage to get your message across.

You can do absolutely whatever you want, it can be audio only for all I care.

If your clip is heinously bad (Camcorder Minecraft footage while you talk about your brony atheist identity) it's not going in. I will cite this paragraph if you want to dispute it, but really I can't see that happening.

If you want to work with someone else, and make your videos flow into one another, get organised and make sure you let me know so I can put you together.

**Tidbits**

----

Feel free to ask questions

[Link to File Dropper](http://filedropper.com)

If you have any suggestions on how to better organise this project, feel free to make your own. Black, hookers etc.

It really, really bothers me because the buzzing sound causes me irritation, it starts to build up irritation and more often than not I quit the video halfway because of it.  
  
Yeah, maybe I'm being anal about it but it's a total turn off. I always point it to people and I'm tired of seeing it being ignored - I don't know if they think I'm just throwing a blanked criticism statement or that it would involve expensive fixes, when it really doesn't.

All you need is the newest version of [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) which is a free and Open Source program to record your commentary, **[use the noise removal filter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuhRj0tvVZQ)** (*Really, check the link!

Okay I have this terrible thing where I get really attached to small subreddits (see /r/truecreepy). I fall in love with the community and try to make it the best it could possibly be. So at night when the insomnia kicks in I start to think about ways to improve things, these are merely suggestions so I would love to hear your thoughts on these.


1) Bring back the weekly thing. Remember back when we had feedback Friday, he asks even though he hadn't even discovered this sub until after it ended. Well it was an amazing concept! It wasn't executed to gracefully, sorry Northernlion, but it was something. Well what if we bring it back but make it more fleshed out. First thing, go to /r/gamedev and check out Screenshot Saturday. Each week they have a different ""theme."" Like controversy, or whatever. This keep things interesting and would prevent people from just pasting links to their playists in the weekly posts. It could be a rule that you have to adhere to the week's theme, this could also spark discussion and thus make it pretty damn awesome. I would gladly be responsible for 
thinking of a theme each week and making the post. 

2) Stop being so damn stingy people. When I made my first weekly update post thing I got 7 upvotes. 7!(Great, but there are still a lot of people that barely get any) Each one of the 6 people that upvoted my post contributed to making my day. This is supposed to be a community, start acting like it, first person that comes to mind that really does comment on a lot of the posts, even though he was severely constructive, i cried a little, in terms of criticizing my let's play is ArmoredChocobo.

3) Whilst I am on the topic of comments: would it kill you to type out two sentences, giving some honest and constructive criticism every now and then. Youtube commenters don't really comment on ways to better yourself that's is why this sub would be so helpful to many of us that are just starting out, or have been doing this for months, maybe even years now. We want you to say, hey your mic is not great here is a link to a great one that is super cheap. You can't expect people to comment if you don't comment. It is a boomerang effect, do unto other something something. I think you get the idea.


4) Mods, keep on kicking ass!

5) Discussions: I think that a weekly discussion thread would be awesome! Maybe a poll type of thing, ""what mic do you use"", ""what let's plays are you watching"", for example


CHALLENGE:
Every week when you update your lp here, try to comment on at least one other let's player's update post.

NOTE: I am probably coming off hypocritical since I don't always comment on here, but I think this post will make me change, because if I know people are gonna be all like ""BUT you said!!"" if I don't. But I do try to make a let's do something fun post every couple of months and give some feedback even though I messed up with last time's.

I sincerely hope I didn't offend anybody and that at least one person takes what I said to heart.

Well I am done now, have a nice day!

1. Do not do shoutout contests or Featured Channel give-aways. If you are popular, you might already get PMs and/or comments of people to watch their videos. Check them out. There might be someone in there that makes good videos which you like. Contact them, make friends and give them a shoutout and/or featured channel.

2. Do not Comment/spam your channel/videos on other people's videos. Would you like that to happen to you? Make sure it's someone whos videos you like to watch and connect with the person first and make friends. Then start talking about your channel/videos.

3. Do not add thumbnails that promise something else instead. No thumbnails of Skyrim with bikini models.

4. Do not use an arrogant intro when promoting your channel on a forum. Or in your videos.

5. Do not copy other people's videos or attitude. Staying yourself will give you a better audience and less thumbs-downs.

6. Do not roleplay unless you are good at it or bad in a funny way. (Neither voice immitations)

7. Do not use trial versions of recordingsoftware that leave watermarks. Buy it.

8. Do not act immature outside recording when replying to others. Fun is important, but staying in character for ever is annoying. Refers to someone who roleplays in his videos.

9. Do not stretch/shrink your video in resolution nor stretch/shrink your video timelength. Unless you have to.

10. Do not record the screen with a webcam.

11. Do not make too long or too short videos. 10 to 20 minutes is acceptable. Too short is a waste and too long is a drag. It also depends on your audience. If they want more, give them more.

12. Do not force to be funny or scared or angry or whatever. Be yourself

13. Do not talk about your groceries unless you are shooting vegatables with your p90 or whatever. Keep your stories related. Unless your audience really likes your story times.

14. Do not talk through game dialogues, maybe you know what it's about, your audience maybe not. Also enable subtitles of the game, if there is any, so people can read it too.

15. Do not talk, whistle, burp or even fart straight into the microphone. Straight is the keyword here. This will cause you to blow into the microphone making it very windy... Try breathing through your nose or talk from an angle.

16. Do not rage on other people. Show them you are better than that. Unless this is your channels theme.

17. Do not publish audio/video-testing recordings. Even if you consider it to be Episode 1. You better make a new Episode 1 if it sucks. You can upload it as Private or Unlisted to check things out.

18. Do not sub4sub. Having subscribers for nothing is worth... nothing. You may look popular but your videoviews shows otherwise.

19. Do not use bots to make fake views.

20. Do not eat or drink while recording. Chewing isn't adding quality to your content. If you have to, pause the recording.

21. Do not be abusive or a racist.

22. Do not use names of famous people in your tags. (Will Smith, Pewdiepie, Obama) Unless it is about these people.

23. Do not make extremely long intro videos (20+ sec). People will eventually just skip them.

24. Do not continu a serie if you think the game is boring or not enjoyable to do commentary for. Tell your subscribers in a video why. Then you can leave them up or make them private for you to look back to. Many bigger names who do LPs also just quit a game and never look back. They sometimes don't even tell why they stopped.

Please comment more DO-NOTs (yummy, doughnuts)... to be added to the list!

So here's my basic proposal: Let's change this subreddit from a place to spam videos, to a place to discuss the ""[inside baseball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_baseball_%28metaphor%29)"" of making LP videos, developing an audience and other related discussions. 

Why?

* Well, first of all, I think the best/most valuable discussions we have around here are sharing tips, helping others with problems, etc. 
* There isn't any other venue on Reddit to get into the nitty-gritty of producing LPs/Gameplay videos/etc whereas there ARE other venues to advertise your videos. /r/games, /r/videos and the specific game subreddits, to name a few.
* Posting videos here is next to useless.  It's my impression (without actual evidence) that the majority of the people here are more interested in advertising their own videos then watching the videos of others.

Thoughts?

1326135597.0,22,self.letsplay,o9m32,Tips for LP Newcomers,gospelexe,23,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/o9m32/tips_for_lp_newcomers/,"I noticed on the previous page of this subreddit that someone was asking for LP advise for newcomers. I have come to you with a few of my personal tips that I have learned either from myself or from other LPers. I will see if I can give examples/comparisons for each of the following sections below as well. Note that I am not an expert at recording LP videos, as I have only done one complete series, but here are some things that I have learned throughout the years that make LPs a little more efficient that you may agree or disagree on.

(I noticed that there was [a comprehensive guide to growing your fanbase on YouTube](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/fpige/hey_rletsplay_i_wrote_a_comprehensive_guide_to), so I thought that I mention that guide as well in this)

* **Motivation:** A great way to start an LP is to be motivated by doing so, and having a fixed and comfortable schedule for LPs is a way to balance out that motivation. Most viewers enjoy videos at an average length of 10-15 minutes, and viewers also want more content spread throughout the period of time. [HCBailly's LP Videos](http://www.youtube.com/HCBailly) tend to be about 15 minutes on average for his Main LP Series (relatively lengthy games), while his Side LP videos lean toward the 10-12 minute marker (fairly shorter games), and these videos are spread out on just about a daily basis, which keeps his contents spread out for viewers to look forward to every day. However, there are some LPers out there that do make marathon videos out there, which people also like, so length of videos isn't a HUGE factor, but this should take into account on how YOU want your videos to be. If you can talk for a whole airplane ride, then feel free to make longer videos, but if you prefer to take a breather, shorter videos are a good option.

* **Equipment:** It is advised to use proper equipment. For computers games, try using a free software such as Camstudio, Camtasia, or maybe you can nab a copy of FRAPS somewhere. However, programs like FRAPS are *SUPER EFFECTIVE*, but not always free. If they aren’t free, they might not be that difficult to find on the web anyway. For console games, especially on current-generation consoles, see if you can invest in a decent capture card that goes from your console and/or television to your computer for the best quality. I have seen people use camcords and digital cameras or phones for LPs, and even I have made that same mistake, and it is just not the greatest thing to use. If you want to do an LP from a handheld system, emulation may be your best bet, with the exception of the PSP, in which there are accessories that allow you to make your television a display screen, which then can be transferred with a capture card.

* **Knowledge/Experience:** - A good LP is particularly an LP that you are very experienced and knowledgeable in. The more experience you have with a specific game, the more you know and the more comfortable you are in what you are talking about, and the more your viewers learn as well. My first completed LP was Phantasy Star Online, and I have been playing that game for years now. I enjoyed commentating on that game and what I knew of it, and it seems like my viewers have also let me know that it was fairly informative and enjoyable as well because I have been so experienced in it. Unlike my failed LP, Legend of Mana (which is now taken off of YouTube due to discontinuation), it was a completely Blind LP for me, which I DID enjoy making, but there were so many rookie mistakes that people would rather not watch, and I knew little-to-nothing about the game.

* **Speech:** I would not say that a good LP is NOT based on how fluent your language of choice may be. Take professors and teachers in school, for instance. Does an instructor from Russia who is teaching a History course considered bad because his English isn't all that great? Not necessarily. In fact, you may be surprised, since he could actually be the best teacher you have ever had. So that shouldn't be the least of your worries, but as mentioned above, try dishing out information for your audience to keep them well aware of what’s going on, whether it be concepts, story, mechanics, features, etc., but at the same time, try overload them with a lot of information at once either.

* **Learn:** Don’t worry about perfection in LPs. We ALL make mistakes at least once in LPs, and if we do, it’s not the end of the world. With enough practice, you will have a great amount of experience to learn from your mistakes in previous LPs, and compare the old LPs to what you have now. Watch other people’s LPs and observe on how they elaborate on the details they give out at a steady rate. As I have mentioned MANY times, HCBailly started out… I don’t know, maybe a little dull? Now his videos are filled with great excitement, joy, and enthusiasm for his viewers, resulting him in millions of total upload video views.

* **Have fun:** I would say that this is probably THE most important part of LPs. Why do you want to do an LP? Because it's fun, right? Or maybe you are just bored? Why would you want to do something that is not fun, *especially* if you do not have to do it? There is no point in it, and you would be wasting time for yourself and others, and quite possibly money as well should you decide to invest in equipment specifically for LPs. Just have fun with the game, narration, scheduling, take these wise tips into account, and do whatever is most comfortable for you.

And for those who prefer a TL;DR version of my “guide” on LPs and of what I have learned:

* **Motivation:** Be motivated to work on an LP. It will help you to keep on going, and keep your videos at a reasonable length to your comfort.

* **Equipment:** Use proper equipment for best quality. Using devices like digital cameras, phones, or other camcord devices are ABSOLUTELY NOT advised.

* **Knowledge/Experience:** Try to do a game that you know very well. While this not required, due to Blind LPs if you so wish, it helps keep the viewers informed on what you know that they might not.

* **Speech:** Don’t worry too much on speech, especially if English is not your first language. As opposed to life, it’s not always how you say things, but WHAT you say that keeps your audience’s attention for your information on the LP.

* **Learn:** Much like a life lesson, you learn from mistakes, or learn from other people. Watch other people’s LPs, and revise on your old LPs to see how you can fix your mistakes that you made in those for future reference in future LPs.

* **Have Fun:** This is pretty self-explanatory. Keep things steady, keep yourself entertained, and simply… have fun doing so by doing an LP of something you do enjoy!

But I hope from reading this post that people will have learned something from here. If you have any direct criticism on anything, or something that you would also advise, post it in here to let not only others know, but to let me know as well. Again, I am no expert, and there is still a lot to learn, so I may learn something here!",,False,self,t5_2qss1,True,,,True,t3_o9m32,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/o9m32/tips_for_lp_newcomers/,

Time for Feedback Friday! Post your video and a description of that video in the comments, and then make sure you offer your creative feedback to another person or two! Don't leave anyone out, if you see that somebody down at the bottom is missing out on feedback, check out their video and help them out!

I will be looking through every comment and reviewing the videos myself for a featured spot on the next Feedback Friday post! Don't look at this like a competition though, this is just to reward a couple of people a week for their hard work. *If you want to be entered into this, it has to be a video from this week.*

**I will start off the submissions with one of my videos from this week!**

[Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past - Episode 5 - The Desert Palace](http://youtu.be/DZWQcAMgqFE) - In this episode I go through the Desert Palace in A Link to the Past

**Here are 2 of the submitted videos I thought were awesome from last week!**

[Let's Play Dishonored - The Knife of Dunwall Part 1 [Intro and Slaughterhouse Pt. 1] ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86PRxmfxQQg) by JakeRies - You have great quality, and great commentary. I like how you are informative to the viewer, especially to someone who hasn't played the DLC.

[Bully - Chapter 3, Day 5 - Who's your daddy?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gt3K2unyR-Q) by VivaVizer - This is pretty much the same as the the above submission. You really make it so there isn't a dull moment in your Let's Play, and it's super informative.

If anyone is interested I will be doing a little bit of a look at my setup and hardware that I'm working with (as well as some suggestions on equipment for youtube and twitch). 

Thanks so much to everyone who has watched my videos and especially those who have given feedback. Good and bad feedback has helped me more than anything and I'm so thankful for people like the ones on this subreddit teaching me new things everyday.

I've just started to record or stream at least one thing everday and it's so far making me very happy to do so.

http://www.youtube.com/user/sortedfood

This is what the new layout looks like and here is my take on it.

* The Good

The Playlists

The Playlists on the bottom of the page look more sleek and organized now and that pleases me greatly, I like organized things

* The Kind of Good but Arguable 

Smaller ""Featured"" video window

The videos on the channel have a smaller window, I kind of like this change and I don't really see this as a great impact change.

* The Bad

No More channel backgrounds

Youtube has thrown branding and customization completely out of the water, no more backgrounds, now all you get is a custom header and that's it, it's not even as good as the last header where you could put links to other channels or social media since now it's just a boring gray tab with links to your other pages.

* The Uncertain

I Can't trully tell you how customizable this layout is not having access to it myself, but no backgrounds seems like a given, the ""Featured"" video seems to be marked as an Intro video of sorts and i'm not sure if you can actually change to recent uploads or a featured video of choice, from iJustine's channel it seems like it is indeed possible to choose what video goes on your channel page.

I ask of you fellow Let's players, what is your opinion of this new layout, personally i really don't like the lack of customization it has, i'd love to hear your opinion

Ps.: Something i forgot to mention, apparently if you turn AdBlock on, the Header of the channel page disappears, I can't confirm this but i've tried that here and it seems true, what the hell?

I'm going through some youtube funk right now and i made this post to share how i'm feeling and maybe help those going through the same.

So, I started posting Let’s Play on youtube in April, since then i’ve gained 23 subscribers, and to me that’s amazing, and I’m posting here to share how i’m dealing with the fact that i’ve had 23 subs for about a month.

First:

Stay positive

If i learned anything from wowcrendor and jesse cox is that it takes a while before you start getting subs, so the best way to deal with the Subscription blues is to just keep releasing content, as long as you’re active you always have a chance to start getting noticed, if you have a channel that’s been inactive for a month, people will just assume you stopped releasing content and won’t take the time to actually watch your videos.

Second:


Keep doing what you’re doing
I release a video everyday, that keeps me mostly active and mostly helps me get me out of the negative mindset that i’m sure everyone goes through when starting out, the mindset that people are just not watching your stuff.

Third:

Talk to people

Can’t get simpler than this, talk to your subs, a lot of times your subs might not be as active, and that’s ok, but when you’re starting out, it’s important to keep talking to them, they are your first subs, and they are important, also be sure to make friends with other people doing what you’re doing and that share your interests.

Fourth:

Don’t let youtube rule your life

If you’re banking everything on youtube, you’re gonna have a bad time, honestly, getting noticed takes time, if you started because you admired other youtubers, remind yourself that most bigger youtubers now started actually a long time ago, some even more than a year, do other stuff besides youtube so you don’t get hung on the fact that it’s taking a while to get views.

Fifth:

Keep practicing

There’s always room for improvement, you can’t let yourself get too comfortable with your skills, challenge yourself from time to time, if you’re a lets player, play a game that you wouldn’t normally play, or a game that just looks interesting, be spontaneous from time to time, it keeps your content fresh and interesting and you’re always improving your skills.

and Last but not least

Be Hopeful

There’s about 7 billion people in the world and that’s a lot of people that can be watching your content, let’s consider that half that don’t really care about youtube, that makes 3.5 billion people, cut that in half again because half of that might not enjoy gaming content, thats 1.75 billion people that could be watching your content, and if you cut that in half because most people don’t have time to watch lets play, that still leaves you with… the fact that i’m horrible at math but that doesn’t change the fact that a lot of people can be watching your content, don’t get too hung up on the why they’re not watching you, i can’t stress this enough, you won’t start posting videos and wake up the next day with 100 subs, and then the next with a thousand, it takes time, but keep in mind that people have their own lives and it might take them a while to get to your content.

And these are mostly the things that keep me from going insane from all this, i don’t know if this will help anyone, but i hope that maybe someday someone will come to this post and see that everyone goes through this funk once in a while, i know it’s hard, but hang in there, things will get better if you just keep trying, be hopeful and make some awesome friends to help you get through the hard times. =)

1371500960.0,18,self.letsplay,1gjeay,Subreddit Idea: What do you guys think of a regular LP jam?,Wayward1,20,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1gjeay/subreddit_idea_what_do_you_guys_think_of_a/,"**EDIT**: Thanks for the feedback guys. Test run ready to go: http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1gl2dx/lp_jam_week_1_vox_data_dealer_flashback_come_make/




LP Jam is a silly name but here's the idea: We specify a few games every week, and you have to do the first 'episode' of an LP for that game. 7 days later, we show all our finished videos, talk about what we learned / how well it went for our own recording and give feedback on others.

There would be no restriction on how you wanted to approach the game (dual commentary, blind, impression, review, whatever) or the type of commentary.

Sort of like a game jam, you see. I can think of a few questions people might have:

**What's the point?**

Feedback Friday is awesome, but there's normally a more videos then good feedback, and a lot of requests come from people who never give back to the subreddit at all.

There's a ton of people here who do genuinely want to improve, and people who are asking what type of games they should record. It would be nice to point them somewhere positive within this subreddit once we've given feedback.

By limiting the game choices to a few every week, we give people a reason to leave their comfort zone, discover new things to record and find out what their strength and weaknesses are. That way, even if they don't get a ton of feedback, they've tried something new.

It also means members of the community here can leave feedback to people who are genuinely also taking part in the community instead of hit and run feedback / view whores.

It also means that people could get a lot of interesting ways to narrate / LP / film a certain title that you wouldn't pick up when we are all filming different things.

Unlike a lot of other community channel things that have come up in the past, there's no pressure to take part unless you felt like it, and it could still be good even with only 2-3 people doing it.

**Where do the videos get uploaded?**

On your own channels! I know there have been community channel ideas here and I've seen the arguments against it, and they are fair. This isn't about views; it's about helping people make better videos, so there's no need to do it anywhere but our own channels.

We could make a playlist at the end for all the videos.

**How do we pick the games?**

Not everyone has the same games, so I was thinking it would make sense to have 3 options a week: A cheap option (Ideally in a bundle or pay what you want scheme that week), a free option, and a retro option (For people more into older games).

...So that's it. Let me know what you guys think, and if there's no issue from the mods and there's no obvious problems with the format I'm missing out, I'll give organising it a go and enter myself, so at least one person is taking part ;)

**tl;dr**: We give users a choice of games to do a short LP on, then come back and discuss how it went as well as give feedback for others.

1370101312.0,20,self.letsplay,1fgu2k,My experience in milestone celebrations,Saigancat,22,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1fgu2k/my_experience_in_milestone_celebrations/,"I hit 1,000 subs recently and after some feedback I decided to do a live marathon of Dragon Warrior on the NES; an attempt to play through the game in one sitting. The Dragon Warrior/Dragon Quest series is the main focus of my channel so it felt appropriate despite the incredibly grindy nature of the game.

I set a date two weeks in advance, for Memorial Day. I had the day off from work and my son was staying with his mom anyways so it was really the perfect day for it. I planned to take a quick stretch break hourly and had plenty of water and juice to keep me going without relying on soda. I made sure all of my recording/broadcast settings were good to go and got it set up to record the chat as well so I could later post the run to YouTube and not seem like I'm talking to myself ;)

16 hours.

That doesn't sound like much when charity marathons go for 24-48, often times without sleep. Maybe I'm getting old, maybe it was just the repetitive nature of such an old RPG, maybe it was any number of things... but by hour 12 I was really struggling and it didn't feel like I was getting closer to completing a game I'd cleared many times in the past.

It was at this point that community made a difference, my regular viewers wanted to see me succeed and began pointing out how many people I had watching the stream (41 on Twitch, I ain't mad). Over the course of the day some viewers had drifted in out of curiosity and became engaged because of the interaction... at this point it wasn't just me struggling through the game, it was everyone. This was a test of stamina now, one that no one wanted to see end in failure.

I don't honestly remember much of the last 4 hours, I died a few times to bad luck (fuck Axe Knights), and suffered a massive loss to an early attempt at the final boss. I remember some fans running the numbers and discovering my character name had generated some of the worst stat growth possible. I remember jokes about how I was on auto-pilot.

I remember killing the final boss and the chat going nuts.

That last part is all I really need to remember. 

I think that celebrating milestones and goals are important. Be sure to reward yourself on the small things, and reward your community on the big things. Your typical episodes should be for yourself or you'll burn out. That's a good rule to follow, if you aren't doing the LPs for yourself it will show and the audience won't engage. You burn out. On those rare occasions that you hit a major milestone- something that was more than a year out, I think it is okay to do something big, something for everyone.

I average 3 new subscribers a day, but I earned a subscription out of 14 strangers who stuck it out in the final stretch... and one of my favorite game series earned 14 new fans, many of whom are struggling with that same game for their first time right now.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,youtube,True,t3_1fgu2k,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1fgu2k/my_experience_in_milestone_celebrations/,

##[Enhanced Audio Benefits]
______
* If the commentator sounds good, attractive, or powerful, they will inherently get more views and subscribers.
* Your voice is the main event. People watch Let's Plays of particular people for their personalities. 
* Why on earth would anyone deny an opportunity to have superior quality than your competition?
* Everyone and their dog can, if provided a good computer, edit and record their videos in 1080p. Audio quality is often ignored and good audio will set you apart as more professional and trustworthy.


&gt; It takes a lot of time to enhance my audio professionally!

* Sony/Adobe video editors are as simple as drop your entire video in, cut to length, and press render. The audio enhancements are added automatically after you configure them once.
* Using **Audacity** actually takes **more** time to enhance your audio. Even if you macro Audacity, you still have to split the audio, export the edited clip, and put the clip back in your editor.


##[Recording Setup]
____
* Blue Yeti
* 48,000 HZ Project rate
* 32 Bit 
* Mono
* All audio filters/effects used in the enhanced sample are provided by default in Sony Vegas/Adobe Premiere. (In this application, I used Sony Vegas)

Honestly I feel pretty dumb for not realising it sooner but if you have multiple hard drives, make sure that when you render to read from one and write to another.

### Let's Play Posting Guidelines

(By guidelines, I mean do this or your post will be removed and ill thoughts will be directed your way.)

##1. Submit Let's Plays as text posts.

If you are submitting a Let's Play, you must submit it as a text post, not as a direct link. That means you click the button that says ""Submit a new text post.""  Within the text of the post, you may (and probably should) link to your video(s) and/or playlist.

With me so far?  [Don't panic.](http://caravanatchurchfarm.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dont_panic.jpg)


##2. Submit no more than one post per Let's Play per week.

This means that if you have one Let's Play going, then once a week you can create one text post with links to all of your new episodes of that Let's Play.  If you have two Let's Plays going, you get to make two, [like](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bwz3u/ccc_plays_black_mesa_17_discussing_science_while/) this [guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bunaa/ccc_plays_bioshock_infinite_14_science_meets/).  If you have fifteen Let's Plays going... how the hell are you doing that?

This does not mean that you are at all required to split your dozens of Let's Plays into multiple text posts.  You can post all of your Let's Plays for the week in one text post, [like so](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bysv6/marcalus_weekly_update_bioshock_bioshock_infinite/), or you could post one Let's Play in it's own text post and the other 213 Let's Plays in a different text post... you see, we love you and want you to have options.

##3. So what's this ""submit a new link"" button for?

Submitting a new link.

...

No?

Okay, if you have informative or interesting content related to Let's Plays, whether that's a video or a picture or some other media format I've never heard of, like voice-y sound stuff or something, go ahead and post a direct link.

##4. Bonus advice!

(Not a guideline, and thus not following it won't get your post removed.  I cannot speak for the possible ill thoughts, however.)

Make your title interesting.  Make your post interesting.  Make yourself stand out from the *drop-and-run* style of posting.  Make us interested in watching your Let's Play.

Be a member of the community.  There's tons of great people here who are far too nice to strangers.  You may learn some useful information on improving your Let's Plays or find someone to collaborate with or even... [make a friend!](http://www.picgifs.com/wallpapers/wallpapers/horror/wallpaper_horror_animaatjes-44.jpg)

Consider visiting us in the [IRC channel](http://www.mibbit.com/#letsplay@irc.gamesurge.net).  We don't bite... hard... enough to draw blood... usually.

As most of you are aware, all playlist updates must be done in a self-post.

**Update submissions must be text submissions**

For the sake of consistency and ease of administration.

**You are allowed one update submission per LP per week**

This is intended to reduce clutter and ensure equal exposure among submitters.

**How your update submissions for a week should look (One submission for each playlist or one of all your activity):**

Let's Play Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory - 1, 2, 3
Mac Plays: Yoshi's Island (SNES) - 13, 14, 15, 16

**Playlist update submissions encompass all additions to the playlist, including the first episode**

The first episode may get special treatment in the future. For now, it is subject to the same treatment as every other video.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCFJChplKRQ

**What is it?**

*3-Minute Let's Play* is an idea I've had for some time, and is pretty self explanatory: take all of the best footage from one game/session and edit it into one 3-Minute video.

In my opinion, this type of Let's Play can, in many ways, be more effective than a traditional, full-length Let's Play, especially for developing channels with smaller followings:

* **They are more likely to hold a viewer's attention** than an average 10-minute-long Let's Play episode.

* A subscriber is often **more likely to click on a 3-Minute video that is in their feed** as apposed to a longer one, depending on the channel and the game.

* They are often faster-paced and ""easier"" to consume, which **can make for more entertaining videos overall**.

* They can **act as ""Pilots"" for full-length Let's Plays**, if the video is well received.

These Let's Plays also have some drawbacks, namely they are far better suited for multiplayer games or games that are fast-paced. They also don't leave a lot of time for the audience to get well-acquainted with the players or the gameplay, however this can also serve as a positive trait, as it leaves the viewer wanting more by the end of the video.

If you enjoyed the video or have any feedback on the *3-Minute Let's Play* format itself, be sure to drop a comment, as I'm interested to hear what viewers think of this style of Let's Play.

For instance, Feedback Friday is about us showing off our work, and seeing how we can improve. Why don't we try something on the opposite side of that?  How about a day where we post links to videos or channels that we really enjoyed that week?  We could talk about what was so special about the video and why we like it so much.  I think it would help as a subreddit because we aren't focusing on ourselves at all.  We are instead, praising those that we think are doing well. 

Maybe it's a bad idea, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to throw the idea out there.  I'm sure there would need to be rules set (such as, we can only post 1 video per week), and the idea altered, but it could be a possibility.  What do you all think?

They're the first thing someone's likely to see when scrolling past your videos. People notice thumbnails much more than titles at a glance.

They tell potential viewers a lot. Most obivously the game and the episode, but also stuff like branding of your channel, playlist cohesion and can even give an insight on the quality of your video.

(While not always true, it's more a 'perceived quality'. Someone with high quality thumbnails will (in the viewers mind) produce high quality videos, right?. Would you rather watch [this video](http://i.imgur.com/hDmvreS.jpg)... or [this one](http://i.imgur.com/Zgr5PmK.jpg)...

I thought so).

The two pillars that thumbnails stand on is **clarity** and **interest**.

In short, *'can I tell what this video's about?'* and *'does it make me want to watch it?'*

---

**Note: This is more about the general concept of thumbnails, not specific image editors. For the interested, I use Photoshop CS3**

---

**In general**, I've noticed two schools of thumbnailing:

+ The same/a very similar image across the entire playlist with usually just the episode number changed

+ The image/elements of the image pertaining closely to that episode alone

---

Now, I should say that as a rule I'd follow these regardless:

+ **Make sure you can tell what the thumbnails about for god's sake!** Zoom away from your thumbnail in your image editor and make sure it's decipherable when small. It's easy to overlook!

+ Make a template where ever possible, saves you a lotta work later on.

+ 16:9

+ Avoid the bottom-right of the image like the plague. YouTube puts a timestamp there and anything you've put there gets hidden *(some people are saying that on mobile devices it's bottom left that's covered)*

+ Use the game's logo where possible

+ Use the stroke feature (or equivalent) to make a contrasting border for any used text, prevents said text from fading into the background

+ In general, gradients -no matter how subtle- look tonnes better than solid colour

+ Use a font that fits [the theme of] the game. Stay away from the likes of Comic Sans and Papyrus. Typing '&lt;Name of game&gt; font' into Google may even yield results if you're strapped for ideas.

+ Stay away from thin, spindly fonts. More often than not they just can't be read when small

---

Right, now let's get onto the **most commonly used type of thumbnail, those that change minimally throughout episodes!**

The key thing with these is, you have to get it right first time. You mess up and your entire playlist follows suit.

I obviously can't tell you what exactly to do here. As each thumbnail design must be fit for purpose, a thumbnail that'd work well for Amnesia definitely wouldn't for Mario...

A good fall back if you're truly strapped for ideas is to go look at promotional art for said game (see the Batman example above, knocked it together in half a minute), while it'll never be ground-breaking, you'll never go far wrong if you compose well a number and maybe your own logo on promotional art!

If you're venturing into more creative endeavours... Then you don't rightly need me now do you? And Godspeed young thumbnail-san!

---

**The main problem with this type of thumbnail however, is that due to the uniformity. People might get lost in your playlist.**

There are some things you can use to remedy that though!

... Something I've used for ages now (and have said before around here) is the use of hue/saturation adjustments across thumbnails, livening them up from just being EXACTLY the same each time. It's incredibly easily done in Photoshop but, I can't speak for other editors.

A common element (most often the background) can be linked to an [adjustment layer](http://i.imgur.com/PE71meY.jpg) that I gradually change the hue of with each thumbnail. This leads to a colour change down the playlist when looking at it on YouTube.

So, this example of GTA4 would go from [this](http://i.imgur.com/B61E8bo.jpg) to eventually looking like [this!](http://i.imgur.com/E2649qn.jpg)

Hopefully, that explains the effect nicely. Should you want to use it.

Another type of thumbnail that fits here is the **mostly text thumbnail!**

And while I've never used this style, my friend [AMLP](http://www.youtube.com/user/AnotherMinecraftLP/videos?view=0) is an advocate and does it very well.

Again, the main points are *clarity and interest*. Note how while the majority of the thumbnail is text, it's noticeably accented and highlighted with elements of the game in question. As opposed to [this](http://www.youtube.com/user/Masterkizz/videos?view=0), which I find -despite conveying all the information it needs to- far from eye-catching.

The slightly translucent black band across the middle also goes a long way to make the text pop out!

---

**Now for thumbnails that relate specifically to events in the episode!**

The best example I've seen of this style is our dear [ChristopherOdd](http://www.youtube.com/user/ChristopherOdd).

He has a distinct template that he's made - *semi-circle and episode number in top left, logo bottom left*. That he just appropriates to the game he's playing with colour, font and logo changes.

He'll then take a screenshot, either directly from the game or from the relevant video, and slap that underneath the whole thing. [*Brilliant!*](http://imgur.com/a/scb9T#0)

The [LinkCableShow](http://www.youtube.com/user/linkcableshow) goes the other way and does it well too! 

Having the background and colour palette conserved across each thumbnail and adding [concept/promotional art](http://imgur.com/a/wNf5J) from the game being played. Sometimes even going in a more creative direction and [using something more stylised](http://imgur.com/a/bTFLr) while still retaining their own look.

It's like I said, branding can also be a massive part of thumbnails. While almost the entirety of those thumbnails is taken up by the episode/game, the distinct style sets it apart as his. Say you have your own logo for your channel -a la [Nerd^3](http://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialNerdCubed/videos?view=0)- then you've got a thumbnail that's simultaneously all about the game AND all about your brand!

---

**MOST IMPORTANTLY**

This is only what I've found to work and seen to work for others. While this may prove helpful, there's no need to copy it verbaitum.

**Find your own style with your own creative flair and even by taking elements of people's thumbnails you like and incorporating it into your own!**

EDIT: Video got taken down (No surprise there, I'm curious to see what their next move is). Here is what Sulf24 and I have said to summarize their silliness.


Sulf24: Basically it was 4 entitled kids under the age of 16 complaining that big youtubers don't write back to them when they beg to do co-ops with them, that they(the big youtubers) are only in it for the money. They were going through a list of LPers they felt were shit. They wanted to make a separate channel and help ""small"" youtubers out, but only if they had 400+ subs even though 3/4 have less than 100 subs.
They did point something out though. It's people like them that make the community suck at times.


Me: Basically what sulf said. These kids were feeling a little bit butthurt and felt the need to rant for attention. And they got it. comments were coming in by the dozens saying how stupid they were and that they were the reason the community sucks. because it is a bunch of whiney twelve year olds who think they can get from 100-100,000 subs by asking for a shoutout. The said things like that they(these 4 guys) were the ""glue of the community"". And that people like Chugga were ""jerks because they don't respond to everyone anymore.""

Another nice summery from Thadiwyn: 
It was the recording of a skype call of 4 (I think, it was hard to tell, they were all talking over each other) guys complaining that big YouTubers weren't helping them (or anyone else) out and they were just in it for the money.
The began to bash the likes of chuggaaconroy for enabling contact lock on his messages and not accepting their friend requests (bear in mind this is so they can contact him so he can give them a shout out or something). As well as then proclaiming in the same breath that his content has been going downhill for a while.
All beautifully capped by them trying to rally people to their -ludicrous- cause. With a caveat:'But only if you have, like, a few hundred subs. If you've only got like 1 or 2 then FUCK YOU', met with laughter.
Because if you can't help me, what's the point right?!
I'm not. Even. Kidding.
They undermined themselves so beautifully I was half-hoping the whole video was satire (the uploader has coming up to 1k subs, mind. He's hardly a very small channel)
I've been LPing for pushing 3 years now, and I've only just broke 500 subs. I'll admit there are times when I get frustrated and think 'why haven't I had my big break yet?'
Do I worry about it? Do I really care beyond those outbursts?
Of course not!
I wouldn't still be LPing if I didn't love doing it with my entire being.
You guys (and these guys) are so much better equipped -the likes of this reddit, of which I'm fairly new to, is a perfect example- for success than I ever was when I started.

1355858993.0,16,self.letsplay,152dim,My LP story. How I started and where I am now.,Bortobob,20,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/152dim/my_lp_story_how_i_started_and_where_i_am_now/,"So, I've been doing game commentaries and playthroughs, or whatever you want to call them, since the very beginning of 2011. I started off doing them with a friend, who at the time did the playing and the commentary. This friend had years of improv under his belt, and was a great character on stage or just in general. I thought he'd be great to have on the microphone. By having taken improv and acting, he had all the necessary tools for excellent commentary. He knew not to say ""no"" to anything, laughed a lot and kept it light, and rarely had dead air. Even if his gameplay itself wasn't skilled, he made up for it with great comedy.

Over the course of the first year, we didn't play a large variety of games, but we did complete the ones we started. The very first was banjo kazooie, being my friend's absolute favorite game, by far. A clear winner! Got that beat, happy as could be. To swing the pendulum the other way, I had him play Amnesia. The amnesia series is our most watched series to date, but he's deathly afraid of the game. I do plan on making him play the second, but he REALLY doesn't want to.

After Amnesia, came some one-off SNES games that he'd never played before, such as Super Mario RPG, DKC2, and others. Disappointingly, he didn't seems to care for them much, if at all. Later was Penumbra.

Eventually, I began to get more and more into the idea of doing commentary myself. At this point, I'd only had one drama acting class from my local community college, so I didn't feel I had the tools for a good performance. But, I just wanted to play games and make people laugh. Or at the very least, entertain. And I still feel that way, somewhat. I'm much more comfortable commentating than I ever have in the past. But, back then, I was like everyone else when they first start. I had dead air, ""jokes"" didn't land, or I didn't even say them because I was afraid. To be blunt, I wasn't entertaining. And looking back, it's unfortunate, but that's just the process.

I started to do my own thing on our shared channel more and more often. My videos got far fewer views/likes than my friend's, and that stuck with me for a long time. It was a quantified representation of how bad I felt at LP'ing. I stuck with it as best as I could. Eventually, I resorted to making videos for the channel as a fall back, when my friend inevitably started to become flaky. Missing scheduled days compelled me to make videos in his absence. Soon, it was almost nothing but me putting up videos while my friend was at class/work/family/whatever. So, I stopped posting to our shared channel, and made my own channel. He hasn't uploaded a video or comment on the shared channel since I stopped contributing.

The shared channel had over 300 subs, with regular hundreds of views per video, and over 400 subs at its best, with the Amnesia series thousands of views. My new channel started ten months ago, with Alan Wake. My very first solo game commentary, with my younger brother watching occasionally. It was a transitory series, my Alan Wake LP... I went through a large range of emotion as I made my way through the game and recorded it. I felt angry at my friend for becoming a flake and abandoning our fun. I felt sad that my new channel had a generous helping of ten subs that followed me over from our shared channel. I was excited for the potential of my personal channel. I was scared of being mocked because of my commentary skills, without a friend to back me up. By the time I had finished, I didn't want to do it any more. I stopped making videos for two months.

Then, suddenly... a beam of light shone through the haze of melodrama... It was Conundrum! A physics based puzzle game, boasting developers from Portal. ""Damn, I loved portal! This game will probably be pretty good! I should do a gameplay video of it..."" I started to become excited about making videos again. I love puzzle games. I loved portal! I wanted to share my adoration with others. I wanted to have other people enjoy this game. I wanted to share.

Thanks to that game, I started playing because it was fun, not because I wanted YouTube views and subs. I was really stuck on the numbers for a long time. They bogged me down because I worried about them. But, playing a game that I really enjoyed working through got me out of that slump. I could feel the difference between playing for other people, instead of playing for myself.

After Conundrum, I brought in another friend who saw my new videos, and wanted to give the whole thing a try. And that was a great thing. It was the proof that really made me feel like I was doing SOMEthing. I got him excited to play games and share as well, and damn, I felt good about that. This new friend is really intense. He started off with Super Meat Boy. We whooped and hollered all day long, playing and dying on that game. The editing was fun, and it all was just a great time. And that continued. He saw how hilarious Amnesia was, and wanted to play that too. Eventually other friends joined in and we played all sorts of games, from minecraft to GuildWars (mostly pc games, as I didn't have an Hauppauge at the time for consoles).

Now, me and my brother play regularly. It's been a very long journey to where I am now. I'm having fun with friends and family doing what I like. I have 23 subscribers, and it doesn't bother me one bit. I'm doing it for fun, and I don't regret it.

What does everyone think of having a Weekly Roundup in an easily readable format, similar to the way the Steam daily sales are presented? - [see here for example](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/wi985/steam_summer_sale_day_02_20120713/). I've thrown together a rough draft below to give you an idea of what I mean. Perhaps we can all work together to decide on the best information to include and format to help the subreddit. It would obviously evolve over time to support the needs of the community too.

Maybe this would help eliminate the stream of zero-comment self-promotions, and bring discussion together into one place.

Note that some of the information below and links are just examples to showcase the idea ;)

[Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Episode 22 - The Master Sword](http://youtu.be/X6cXPOnqLmM) - **I really need your help with this**, I've changed my channel to a more ""completionist"" style of LP. I'm so nervous with it, and I have no clue if I'm doing it right or making huge mistakes in certain places. I'm trying to put my best foot forward and make a more viewer friendly LP of every game I play.

**Here are 2 of the submitted videos I thought were awesome from last week!**

[P&amp;M Play Games - Ep 2-3 - Battletoads NES (Mar-Apr 2013)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiltqRsy4vY) by PernellAndMatt - You didn't post a video from the week of the post, but I felt like it was too good to not post(I chose one of your videos from that week instead). You guys have such a great presence while you're playing games, it feels like Game Grumps but in a different way. The only things I have found that weren't great were things that iron out as your Youtube channel grows and you learn how to use certain programs better.

[Channel Trailer #1.1 - Short Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyGJAXXKP9Y) by WeaselZone - Not only was your trailer good, but the whole layout for your channel is amazing. It really gives the vibe that you're dedicated to what you do. From what I see in your trailer, you're not scared of the camera or microphone. Confidence is one of the big factors in a Youtube channel, and you have it. One thing I would change in the trailer is that the music is a little too loud, we don't want to subscribe to you because of the music you like :P.

I think they're really good fun. It adds more than one person's views and perspectives on the game and provides a kind of conversational dynamic to the viewer. It also is a good source of comedy and I imagine (having never done one) it would make it easier to talk solidly through the game - I know, particularly in puzzle games, I find myself struggling to narrate because I'm trying to think and I'm TERRIBLE at multitasking.

As a group LPer, why do you do it, and what kind of benefits and perks do you think it brings? Single LPers, would you ever consider doing joint LPs (more so than collabs and co-ops).

1361218632.0,15,self.letsplay,18rqfd,Let's talk about goals.,MARIOCAT,18,3,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/18rqfd/lets_talk_about_goals/,"While browsing the subreddit, you will see a lot of people asking things like ""How do I get more subs/views/comments etc"", and quite often the reply is ""You shouldn't be worrying about that, do it completely for fun"".

While these people (In my opinion, and remember this is *all* opinion) are right in some respects, I think goals are important and shouldn't be overlooked. No, you shouldn't be *concentrating* on subscribers and views, and you *should* be doing this for fun, but with any hobby, it's nice to measure your progress. 

You can indeed measure your progress by seeing how you have improved in your own opinion by watching old videos. But then you need to ask yourself your end goal? If you like playing games then why not just play them? Why record and edit footage, spend ages uploading it and stuff, if you aren't doing it to entertain? And of course we all want to entertain as large of an audience as we can. Therefore, measuring progress with a subscriber number is indeed fair. **Before you flip out** this shouldn't be your only drive for doing this, if you have even a small audience and 1-2 subs that watch your stuff, you're technically entertaining, so you're achieving your goal.

But larger goals are important, and I didn't want this to be preaching. I feel that aiming to improve yourself is fantastic, and having goals is an excellent motivation for this. Some of the skills learned from proper editing, SEO, public speaking etc etc are applicable in real life, so even if you don't get far, it's good to improve. 

It's also important not to get too attatched to these goals, as if you pin all your hopes on them, it can be crushing. So the discussion I wanted to start was;

1358476249.0,15,self.letsplay,16sje5,Methods for building subscribers,eeleyes,17,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/16sje5/methods_for_building_subscribers/,"Method sharing time,

Having worked on a few podcast and other channels that have already been build I have decided to start my own channel of lets plays. Noticing how hard it is to get initial views I starting some studying and came up with some method based on knowledge, experiences etc.

* Twitter,

Twitter is fantastic for PR if you have subscribers. Now a catch twenty two I need to build subscribers on twitter to PR my channel. So how does one do this, get to know people.  Spend around 30 minutes a day just tweeting to strangers, reply to their tweet and as long as you have done a search for a topic your interested in you will have common ground.

* Reddit

I am assume because you are here you know how Reddit works. Now reddit can be good but it can also be a huge waste of time, from experience I have never had something blow up from reddit. Video, podcast or music, never! 
However the best way to work this is to reply to other post of similar interest. Doing a video on FTL, go find an ftl reddit and talk to people about your channel on there. Remember though, no one likes a cock in their face e.g. Dont approach a post by going *HERE IS MY CHANNEL It is good*. Try to be a bit more subtle i.e. someone if talking about Zelda, *well here is my speed run I did a bit earlier, not very fast but you could pick up a few tips*.

* Message boards

One approach which has worked hugely for me in the past is forums. Spending about 30 minute twice a week I would go to the same board (alternating each week) and post a question like *hey guys I just started watching lets plays and I found xxx can anyone suggest something similar*. After a day or two I would check back and reply to some messages, deal with flaming etc.

* Meta data

Posting a new video and not sure on the tags to use? Check what others are using. Find a popular video similar to yours and right click on the page to view source information (right click &gt; view page source). Look for the tag that says &lt;meta name=""keywords"" content=""xxx,xxxx,xxx

The words in the commas are what these people are using for tags.

* Video responses 

This one is a bit of an effort but if you can spare the time find some smaller channel that still allow vid response (bigger channels wont) and make a response vid. Doesn't have to be long but your chances of grabbing some subscribers is alright. Remember dont try to trick people or lie about anything. Nobody want that shit.


Try a nice simple *""So xxx I have been watching your videos and I though that i would give this game a try""* and then inculde a few minutes of gameplay. **Try not to exceed 3 minutes because people who do not care about you yet will stop watching. Smaller is MORE**


* Liaising

On method pointed out by [Blammelton](http://http://www.reddit.com/user/Blammelton) is connecting with other smaller channels. Spend some time watching and subscribing to other smaller channel. Make sure when you do this you ensure that you are commenting on their videos, offering advice and tips etc. 

Remember though, nobody wants to be told that their work is shit. No matter how bad it may look I can ensure you someone has spent a decent amount of time trying to make their video. Make sure that when you offer a suggestion you do so kindly ""*wow I really liked your video but in the future you need to try and fix your voice modulation. Maybe through so fabric over your mic so that it doesn't pic up your pops*.

The best part is not only will you find some cool channels (as much as I hate too say it but gamegrumps are not the only funny channel out there) but you might pic up a thing or two to improve on your channel.

For now that is it but leave some comments and we can add more to the list.

To improve the sense of Let's Play community, I had an idea inspired on Twitter's Follow Friday.  
  
For those who don't know, in Twitter, there's something called #FollowFriday - you pick five people you think that post interesting tweets and tell other people to check them out because in your opinion they're worth following. I guess something like this could work in r/LetsPlay.  
  
I have some basic idea that I'd like to propose. Something like this:
  
* A topic is made by someone every ~~Friday~~ Sunday, where people will post replies with their recommendations.
* People pick 3 to 5 Let's Plays that during that week you think were interesting, or have done something interesting, or achieved a milestone or that you just think needs more love, or... wathever. Maybe we could do without the minimum number and just put a cap of maximum 3 recommendations per week?
* It doesn't matter if the person is famour or not, neither if their LP is video, screenshot, text-only, AAR, etc. It only matters that you think that it's worth the recommendation.
* No self-promotion, no linking your own videos  - and no making accounts to promote itself as if you were someone else. It defeats the purpose of the idea.
* Try to not turn into r/circlejerk by only posting things made by people of this subreddit. I'd not say to prohibit it, but try to keep it into a minimum? Like... 1 if you post 3 suggestions, or 2 if you post five? Or just leave it to common sense?
* Explain your recommendation. Example:
  
&gt; ""I thought that [Insert Name Here]'s *macho-redneck-manchild* comedic persona would never work and make this unbearable to watch, however he does it in such away that it's actually entertaining. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but he is worth a check just for the experience*"";
     
or   
&gt; ""I've been following [Name Goes Here]'s work for some time now and she finally got 100 subscribers - a well deserved number considering the quality of the work she has been putting out all this time - so I think it's worth checking her"";   
  
or   
&gt; ""[Crafty Trendy Nickname]'s Let's Play Final Fantasy VII at LiveJournal just ended. It's a hilarious experience where she LPs as Cloud's personal diary over-blowing the angst of the protagonist into an emo teenage for *teh lulz*. Worth every second I spent reading"".
  
Anyone up for to try this next week? Any point about the suggestion you'd like discuss and improve upon this idea?

I figured this might be useful for those who have the bandwidth to upload this kind of file and might be concerned with it.

I had been hearing from many people about this ""Original"" quality trick on YouTube, and frankly I thought it was hogwash. I've always been skeptical of these tricks and tips for ultimate quality and to be honest... 150% of them are simply people switching from doing the wrong thing to the right thing. It's like, ""SUPER SIMPLE TIP TO MAKE YOUR CAR LAST LONGER."" And it ends up being, change the oil or something.

So after @GopherGaming, one of the guys I follow did a video talking about this issue, I decided to sit down and do some personal research. The idea is, is that YouTube allocates much higher bandwidth for a video in the original category, and you simply upscale your video to make it into that Original quality bracket. At first I thought this was simply ridiculous. Obviously upscaling would cause aliasing problems and would cause the bitrate to be stupid. 

I was wrong.

Dead... wrong...

It appears the Original option which for a long time was reserved for up to 4096x3072 (4k Cinema files) still had seemingly the same bitrate, so your 2048x1152 files which have 110-112% of the original resolution now have 250-290% of the original 1080p's bitrate, the results are night and day. Blocky walls now come to show their original colors and details, grass went from watercolors to something actually... looking like grass, and rocks went from styrofoam to textured lumps. It's wonderful.

It's a very simply process, just make sure you're sending youtube a 2048x1152 file and it will move to the higher bracket.

What makes me unique? I don't do LPs. I'm strictly a consumer of your products.

So, what do I contribute to this community? My perspective on your LPs. As ""just a viewer""; I don't really get into the whole background info of proper tagging, partnering, etc. But I can give you my thoughts as one of your consumers. The things that I liked.. The things I didn't like.. The things that pissed me off to the point that I wouldn't finish the video, let alone the entire series.

I give my criticism in a very free-flow, stream of consciousness format. I open up a text editor and write notes as I watch your video. It is completely unfiltered, so it can sometimes be a bit rude, but it's the exact thoughts going through my head.

Disclaimer: I will admit that I have my own personal preferences when it comes to the LPs that I watch, so I might not be your exact target demographic, but I'll give you an honest review from my perspective.

What do I get out of this? Helping you guys is one of the big ones, but to be honest, I'm looking for some more LPs to add to my viewing list.

I lurked here a lot with an alternate username but I thought we could get a good advice and feedback thread going. I haven't been doing this very long, by any stretch, but I feel like I can answer some questions if anyone has any, and also give some feedback. So if you have a question, post it below and I'll see what I can do. If you want me to feedback on some of your content, post it and I'll take a look! (I'll be basing my feedback on the first few minutes though because I wanna do as much of this as I can, so pick your video wisely!)

Also, if you post for feedback, give someone else in the thread some feedback too! Give aswell as take. If you think you can answer someone's question too, please do, I'm by no means an expert and would appreciate some help on this. This ***IS*** a stupid questions amnesty though, so let's not mock anyone for asking something they might have been scared to previously, haha.

**I'm giving the same advice to a lot of people, so for the sake of making it easier, here are some basic commentary improvement tips that helped me**

- Sounding enthusiastic is *really* important. Not overly enthusiastic and forced (This is just as bad as bored, if not worse sometimes), just not-bored. I said this to someone else, if you sound bored, your audience probably is too, because it's contagious, you aren't engaging them. Try smiling while recording, as the smile is audible in your voice.

- Game choice can be quite important, and the game you were playing didn't give you very much to talk about at all. Eventually you'll get to a point where you can talk over *anything*. Blind LPs are okay, but I think it's important to learn the controls and maybe play the first level/few minutes just to get to grips with it, because slow progress is boring, and learning controls and stuff is slow.

- Practice makes perfect. Cliche but probably more relevant to YouTube than the usual cliche uses for it. The more you post, the more experience you get, learning what works for you, how to choose good games, how to have good commentary, meeting people, promotion etc etc. Just crank out content, treat it all as good practise, and without realising it you'll feel more confident about everything you do, it will be normal.

***TL;DR: If you want some advice or feedback post in here! I worded the title poorly and it looks like I'm asking for some, hahaha***

So, I was hoping you could help me clear up some confusion I have regarding networks, and why channels join. Specifically: if you're in a network now, or thinking about joining one: why did you? Was it for promotion? Was it for an automatic-parntership you didn't think you could get otherwise? Was it because you needed to hurdle the ""Content-ID wall"", to make sure your content was protected verses being potentially taken down?


As an independent YouTuber, you can still achieve a partnership, keep 100% of your earnings, and likely see RPM totals north of $8 with long-form LP content. Whereas, many networks' starting offers take 30% of your earnings, and offer flat RPM rates of only $2.00. Is the promise of ""promotion"" or ""protection"" from these networks enough incentive to give up so much of your income? 


I hate to see YouTubers make poor business decisions, and this is one is easily the biggest issue facing the community today, so I hope a discussion will be educational for all of us. Thanks for answering my questions in advance. I'm a independent network owner myself: so if you have any questions regarding the other side of the equation (how Content-ID works, etc), I'd be happy to help.

Unable to easily secure a full YT partnership on their own, are LPers at a disadvantage, that forces them to sign bad contracts with greedy networks?

---
A few weeks ago I was having major problems with enthusiasm. I wasn't wanting to record or edit anything, and was generally not enjoying anything. It ruined my mood IRL. It was in part due to requests to do a specific LP (which I don't blame people who do request it, if you're reading), boredom with the current game I'm LPing, inexperience with editing etc.

so I went out of my way and talked myself through how to fix these problems. I started a once-a-week series where I play whatever I like, rejigged my schedule to give me a bigger gap between having to record so I could focus on recording and editing other channel-related things. It was going really well for a week until I did one specific video.

You can probably figure out, or know, which video I'm talking about. I got a game a few days before launch and did a review/first impressions on it and absolutely hated it, and made no attempt to hide that in the video. I ripped in to it, gave it a few positives and thought nothing of it. I'd done that before and nothing bad ever happened. Except, turns out a lot of people really like this game and it has gotten pretty good reviews. I got slammed, then the good reviews the game got made me think I was wrong about my review and have made me not really trust my own opinion.

Fortunately, the post I made in the game's Steam community got deleted, and the developer is fine with my video. However, I still got a load of comments ripping in to me, calling me a faggot, y'know, usual Youtube shit. I was a bit pissed at first, and I haven't had the best week IRL either, but overall nothing I couldn't handle. Even got some advice from TotalBiscuit which helped.

However, some people are now going through my older videos and giving me shit on them. Only one or two comments, but enough to make me a bit annoyed. Again, nothing I can't handle.

However, it has made me start taking genuine criticism a bit worse than I used to. I start to get legit angry when people criticise my videos, and then I feel bad and pissed at myself because I really should not be reacting that way. I haven't publicly voiced this, and have luckily not blown up at anyone, but the simple, knee-jerk reaction to get angry at criticism, even from people I respect, is worrying me. Especially when you consider just the week before I'd specifically asked for critique on how to improve my videos and took what was said on board. It's been like night and day and I hate it.

I don't want to get in to the frame of mind that the opinion of the commenter doesn't matter just because it's hurtful, because then I'd never improve. But I'm not taking criticism well now, am getting more annoyed at people than I really should, and worst of all **I am getting anxious uploading videos because of the reaction they could get.** I have only recorded one video since all this happened, and that one wasn't very good.

Basically, I *really* don't want to quit doing Youtube, but I'm worried that Internet morons really are getting to me. I'm worried I'll do something stupid, blow up and then bob's your uncle I'm branded as an asshole. It's all totally irrational and I can't shake the feeling.

Any suggestions beyond ""Suck it up"" and ""stop being a little bitch""? I've been leaving the usual ""Thanks for watching!"" comment, but is there anything I can do to deal with them that doesn't blow back in my face? Is there anything I can do to get back in my old mindset when taking criticism? I'm fucked and don't know what to do.

Thanks for any help.

Keep in mind, this will NOT make you famous, and I am speaking from my own experiences so far. I've met some pretty amazing people (Yes, even some of you!!!) from doing what I talk about here. I hope this helps a little bit, and feel free to add your own tips or feedback in the comments.


_______________________________________________

**What is Networking?**

   Put simply, networking is branching out.  Reaching out to your fellow peers, keeping in contact with them. This could, and should include things like: Getting feedback from them, collaborating with them, sharing ideas and knowledge, etc.  It is, of course, not only limited to those things, as it is quite a complex beast, when you get down to it.


_____________________________________________________

**Okay, Jake, so I know what it is...Now what?**

Well, put yourself out there! Don't be shy! Think of it like asking out your crush. Yeah, it can be scary, but honestly, what's the worst that can happen? They say no, and you move on? Exactly. So go ahead, champ! Ask away!


________________________________________________________________

**Okay, I will ask, geez. How should I do this? I'M AWKWARD LEAVE ME ALONE**

Ah, now here's where it may get tricky for some.  Ever been watching one of your favorite YouTuber's, and you decide to browse the comments and you see something along the lines of: 

&gt; Hey MrMillionViewsAnHour! WATCH MY SHIT PLEASE DO IT AND MAKE ME FAMOUS 

Yeah, so that's how **NOT** and I can't stress this enough, **HOW NOT TO ASK!**  Asking in this manner not only makes you lessen you chances of collaborating with said individual, but you also run the risk of people finding you to be annoying as hell, then in some cases maybe even going and just downvote bombing your channel. Yikes.

Now, that brings up your first choice: 

__________________________________________________________

**Commenting on videos**: 

&gt; But Jake, you just told me not to!

No, I didn't! What I meant was, don't beg. So go forth my child, and comment away, comment in a manner of saying something like ""**Hey CoolPerson44, I really enjoyed that part of your video when you shot the guy in the noggin. I think you're doing a great job, keep it up!**""  Now, I'm not saying stroke a person's ego on every single video, and this works best with **Smaller** channels. 90% of the time, if you comment on a video by, say, Totalbiscuit, they will not even read it. It's not that he hates you, no, it's just there are MILLIONS of other comments, and no one has that kind of time.

Look, what I'm saying here, is over time, if you are a repeat customer for a channel, and consistantly leave comments and feedback, they'll notice. I promise. Will this 100% guarantee you a collab spot with them? No. But it will put you on they're radar, and sometimes they might even check out your channel, sub, and you can start to build a relationship.

____________________________________________________________

**Twitter, Facebook, and other Social Media**

Twitter is a powerful tool. There's no doubt about it.  Chances are, all of your favorite LPer's  have a twitter. Follow them. Interact with them. Stalk their bushes. Collect the hair off of their comb....Oh...uhhh... okay a little too far, easy guys. 

But seriously, interact with fellow LPers on Twitter! It's the same principal behind commenting on videos.  The more you interact with fellow LPers, the more they notice you. Now, don't spam them, that just makes you seem needy and annoying.  Basically, just have casual conversations and discussions with them through Twitter, like you would a normal person (well, I mean they ARE normal people!), and again, you will start to build a relationship. 

Chances are, unless you're an ass to them,  they would be more than open to do a collab with you, provide feedback, or even help give you a nice little bump (both in views and in subs.) 

So you just covered a hot new indie game and are really excited about your video? FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, SEND THE DEV YOUR VIDEO!!! Nine times out of ten, they are MORE than happy to watch your video, and if you're not totally trashing their game, they will probably retweet your video, which means more views, more subscribers, and maybe even more people to collab with.  

Know who follows that indie game dev you just showed your sweet-as-hell video to? More indie devs. And guess what, they liked your style! Know what else? You're free publicity, and sometimes they may even ask you to cover their game , and might even five you a review copy.  (see, networking hard at work!) Twitter is a powerful tool, **USE IT**


________________________________________________________________

**Okay, so Twitter = Good, What else can I do?***

Okay, so I heard of this really neat site where people can go and post all kinds of cool stuff. Infact, you're on this site right now. Mindblowing, I know.

**Reddit** is potentially more powerful than Twitter. There, I said it. Know those Feedback Friday posts? Use them! Interacting with other users is the first step in Networking. Give feedback, receive feedback, and don't be afraid to say something like ""Hey, I really liked your video! I think we have a pretty similar style, If you'd like, maybe we could do a video together some time"" or something along those lines.  Chances are, they'll be more than happy to give you a look over, and probably even collab. 

So, you've done Feedback threads, done some discussions in other threads around here, etc. What else can you do on Reddit?

Post your video to the subreddit for that game, or if it doesn't have it's own subreddit, I know /r/indiegaming is a pretty good place to test the waters (for indie game related videos.)


____________________________________________________________


**Last but not least, Steam, Online Games, and forums**

So, you REALLY love playing Team Fortress 2. I'm sure you've built quite a friends list off it.  Well, silly, I bet some of those friend would LOVE to collab with you. Would love to see some of your videos. Now, don't be pushy.  Subtle hints, say, like ""Hey, I did this funny thing in TF2."" If they watch that video, chances are they will check out the rest of your stuff and maybe even share it with others. These types of interactions lead to collabs.  Don't ever discount the games you play online, or even steam / forums for that matter.

I have very little experience with forums, but they are a great place for discussions, especially for specific games.  Enter these at your own risks, but remember,  just because you don't collab with some one, doesn't mean they can't give you feedback, or other things.


_____________________________________________________________

**Epilogue...***

Still awake? Awesome! Hopefully I was able to show you, even a little bit, the right way, and the wrong way to network, and some basics.. Thanks for reading, and good luck, my LP pals!

**TL;DR:** Don't be a pushy mother fucker. Don't comment on videos begging for views and subs. Just interact with your fellow human being through YT, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc. like it's a casual conversation. &lt;3

During this time I have seen a lot of things that I wish wouldnt crop up on this subreddit - im not talking about posting direct links etc which has already been taken care of but other more subtle things that I feel this subreddit would be better off without. Bear in mind the following are only suggestions and if people dont agree with them that's cool too.

1. No more ""I just reached xxx number of subs"" threads please. Honestly Im very happy for you and I even upvote the threads but they contribute very little and only block up the front page

2. No more ""hey I will give feedback threads"" cleverly disguised as ""oh here I'll also post my channel"" give feedback for 2 posters and then use all the upvotes to generate traffic for your own channel. We all know what Im getting at here. If you want to give feedback thats fine. Leave your own channel out of it if people are grateful for your help they may check it out of their own accord.

3. I feel that if someone is looking for feedback on their own work then they should be around for a certain period of time. You dont have to be commenting in every thread but I'm more likely to look at your stuff if I recognize the username and saves me getting burned by dump and go merchants.

Look at the end of the day we are all here to learn how to make better videos and interact with other members of the community. I have no problem with self promotion once its clearly labeled as such i.e. in the weekly updates of lets play threads. What I find really annoying is all the not so covert ways of trying to boost traffic to your channel. Look we'd all like a bigger viewing audience but you have to realise by doing this constantly you are deminishing what this sub reddit is all about

I want to have a professional post, because this subreddit should be more than a place to just plop your video.

I was a really shy guy and I thought making youtube videos would help me practise speaking and 'come out of my shell' so to speak. Well I think its worked, and I can see a vast improvement in my videos.

Recently I went back and 'remade' one of my earlier videos. The reason being, I started a lets play of The Witcher two years ago, then left it incomplete and went on to other games (the reason is in the video, if you're curious). Well now I finally went back and redid that video, and I intend to actually finish my Witcher playthough (finally!). When I look back and compare the first video to my new one I'm amazed at the difference I can hear. I'm quite proud of myself actually. Considering how shy I used to be, this is a big achievement for me.

I'm listing the ones I know about, if you guys know others please let me know and I'll update this list. Unless otherwise noted, the ones listed here will more likely only get advertisement on your videos.

**Warning:** I take no responsibility if the publishers decide to change the way they operate and you end up being hit with copyright strikes. Please, help to keep this list updated for the benefit of everybody.

**Gameplay Related**

* **Konami** matches visual content in gameplay videos of it's franchises (and I tested it with mute videos for Castlevania and Metal Gear Solid, it's not music, nor cutscenes, neither voice acting. It's the actual gameplay). Confirmed for pretty much every Konami franchise - including Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid, Gradius, Suikoden. 

* **Sega** has been taking down videos of Shining Force recently, how much of it's deliberated or an actual policy is not known. **Channels have been taken down because of Shining Force, BEWARE.**

* I know **Atlus** matches third-party on the opening videos of some their games - Persona 3 and 4, for example. I know it's visual, not only the songs by themselves  - it is because they upload the openings to their official channel - but if you cut them you're safe.

* **Capcom** had at least one Match Third-Party content incident that I known on Lost Planet and Mega Man vs Street Fighter (confirmed by /u/RockLeeSmile and /u/Bolshok) but it seems completely random. Resident Evil 6 is also getting third-party content matches due to cutscenes. *Difficulty of dispute unknown, but recent news says that disputes are being denied and claims being reinstated, needs more information.*

* **Disney**'s Club Penguin games trigger visual content Match.

* **Eletronic Arts (EA)** - Cutscenes may be matched by the content ID system (confirmed for Dead Space 2). They also may match content on gameplay of Battlefield 3. Disputing the claim is apparently easy.

* I heard about people getting visual matches from **Sony** for Killzone 3 videos, I'm not sure though because it was long ago. *Updated info needed**.

* **Square-Enix** had some content ID matches with Final Fantasy XIII and Dissidia Final Fantasy around the time of release. *Needs information about current situation.*

* **Microsoft**'s recent [EULA update](http://www.xbox.com/en-US/community/developer/rules) seems to open the way for them to use the Content ID System, although they seem to turn a blind eye to it. *Needs info on actual incidents.*

* **Namco Bandai** had a Visual Content ID Match ID spree in Mid-2011 that seems to have continued to Mid-2012. No idea about the current situation but it seems they stopped, *needs more information*. 

* **Ubisoft** - Mostly due to cutscenes being used as promotional material. Assassins Creed III Opening may be matched by IDOL due to the opening theme. Far Cry 3 while being chased by Vas. Disputes apparently successful and without major hassles.

* **THQ** triggered visual content match on Darksiders and Darksiders II. Apparently it's due THQ's logo on the opening credits. They also seem to match cutscenes in certain games (confirmed for Saints Row). 

* **WWE games** may be tagged by THQ (the publisher) or even by WWE itself as they are VERY protective of their trademark. From my knowledge disputes are usually not accepted. *Needs more information.*

* **Riot Games** may match visual content on League of Legends but dispute should be easy considering their [**Official Policy on YouTube and Streams**](http://www.riotgames.com/legal-jibber-jabber) videos (which allows monetization).

* **Inazuma Eleven** videos may be matched to content of 【**イナズマイレブン 仲間**】 (*Inazuma Eleven Nakama*). It may or may not be an official representative of the franchise/license, needs confirmation.

* Pretty much any non-public Alpha/Beta/Leaked Build/Pre-Sale Date video without specific authorization will warrant a take down due to the source of the footage being acquired illegally or for breaking a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).

* Cutscenes that are distributed as PR and for promotional material may be tagged by the Content ID System by the publisher or gaming news outlets. Difficulty of dispute depend on which was the source of the claim, but often they end up being cleared.

-------------------
  

**Music Related**

* **Bethesda**'s games may be matched third party due to the company that composes musics for their games (IMG). Match is easy to dispute.

* **Mist V** has soundtrack music claimed by Riptide. Difficulty of dispute unknown. *Needs more information*.

* **Square-Enix**/**Eidos** has music protected by collecting societies in Sleeping Dogs that can get your video flagged. You have to keep the radio turned off.

* **Rockstar** also has the same deal with music in some of the GTAs.

* **Far Cry 3** has commercial music on the game.

* **Initial D** games (published by Sega) and other japanese rythm such as **ParaPara Paradise** games are usually flagged and taken down due to eurobeat music by the **AVEX group/records** - for some reason they are VERY aggressive in protecting their eurobeat IPs (more than their singers from other genres). **May give you an actual copyright strike.**

* Nearly all Rythm/Dance games due to music publishers.

* Many Japanese games use J-Pop/Rock songs in their openings and that may get your videos flagged. You may need to replace the opening song or cut the video.

* Pretty much any game that uses actual commercial music will need to either have the songs turned off or cut from the video to avoid a copyright claim from the record labels. **Channels have been taken down by it, be careful!**

* Some games may have classical music on it and you may get a claim on the video from a collection society or record label that produces and sells *royalty-free* packages despite the music themselves being public domain because the actual recording may not (or may be erroneously matched to one that isn't). Those are easy to dispute, but may take some time. Examples: Mega Man Legends 1 &amp; 2.

Okay so I and many others have been having a problem with file sizes. I mean we all want the best quality, but none of us want to wait 2+ hours for a 15 minute video to upload now do we? 

*Insert collective no here*

Well after messing around I have finally found a way to deliver pretty decent results!

Okay so I guess I should make this look professional?

Just follow these simple steps and you too can have 1080p videos without having to make your ISP suicidal!

1. Record video!
1. Edit your video.
1. Render your video out using the highest possible settings, file size doesn't matter, you just want something that looks good.
1. [Download Handbrake!](http://handbrake.fr/)
1. Import your giant ass video file!
1. [Use these settings, but change them as you see fit **BUT**](http://imgur.com/gSGtD)
1. In the area where it says target size you have to do some math. Simply take the length of the video and multiply it by around 40-50 then you get the recommended file size for full HD!
1. Click play and do something else, the program is quite fast so it wont take that long. (Hopefully)

That is it, if you followed these steps closely you will see a dramatic decrease in file size while keeping the same quality.

As a result from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/wjbpt/a_proposal_for_the_community/) topic, this is our first topic. From now on, every Sunday we'll have this topic with the objective of posting what you've seen during the week on the LP community as a whole that you can count as highlight and worth showing others. Please, remember to follow the rules.
  
  
**-- Rules --**  
  
These are the rules for Spotlight Sunday, as it's the first week some may not apply for today but will apply for next week. These rules can be reviewed by the community.  
  
* There's no minimum ammount of recommendations, but avoid going over 3.
* Choose to recommend people who in your opinion are interesting and and whose work represents quality and deserves to be highlighted. Quality is subjective and everyone's tastes are different, but you can reward what in your opinion was great - so while there's no clear criteria for quality, we believe in the community being honest with that.
* Explain your recommendation for others and tell us why you think that submission is worth everyone's attention.
* No self-promotion, this topic is for promotion of others, not yourself. People promotes themselves on this subreddit regularly and this topic is made to make others shine.
* Keep the circlejerk to a minimum: If you're going to recommend someone who post regularly here try to recommend someone else who isn't a member of r/letsplay to balance it out. Also, you can post links for friends of yours, but remember to highlight it and justify why you're recommending them.
* Do not repeat the recommendation of the past week. If you're going to recommend someone for a second time, make sure you didn't last week.  
  
  
  
*Note:*  
  
I'd like to include [EatingSteak's Topic](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/wkw76/my_favorite_lets_plays_recommendations_for/) because he beat me for some hours while I was sleeping =) Go there and check his recommendations.

You post a link in the comments below to your LATEST VIDEO, I will assess, review and give advice on how to improve. I have seen my fair share of LPs so I think I have an idea of what makes one great. 

Reasons for doing so:

- I want to start an LP soon (first one) and want see all the little nuances that make an LP great as well as the ones that make it not so great. Also I want to train myself to avoid the bad ones.
- I am bored and think it will help some of you out
- I want to make myself feel better, so if I like the video I will comment and like it.
- Feedback Fridays seem to have disappeared and nobody seems to be getting any comments
- Four points seem like enough, don't you think?

So I have a series called 10 minutes of... . I posted in this sub reddit on a weekly basis, asking for someone who has an LP of that game in order to include them in the video. Between that, and all of the people asking for LPs to watch, I've come to the conclusion that it would be a great idea to make a grand LP list.

Basically, copy and past the format below, fill it out, then I'll include it in the original post. Let's try and make a huge list here guys =]

Please make your channel a clickable link, just for the ease of everyone.

To do this, make sure you bookmark all of the servers you wish to go on and then while in one, choose ""Bookmarks"" and middle mouse click OR right click and choose ""Open in new tab""

This will make it so that you can traverse the servers as you please. Make sure to activate your microphone with the button at the left of ""Microphone mute"" on the server that you want to talk in.

So there it is, Hopefully now people might be more inclined to give this server a visit, I'l post some more information here for anyone who needs the info to connect.

I recently decided that I was sick and tired of being such a shy and socially introverted person. Playing so much Skyrim, I started drifting into profound (at least to me :P) thoughts of what it really means to 'live', and what constitutes a life worth living. Anyway, this eventually led to the realization that I was using Skyrim far too much as an escape from life, rather than a form of entertainment. So I decided to flip that around. I created a YouTube channel in the hope that it will serve as a positive influence in my life, and push me to try and connect with people, even if not in person. This would be a place to do all the things I feel I've wanted to do, but have been too afraid or nervous to.

I couldn't imagine a better start to channel than to create a Skyrim Let's Play. Skyrim has been such a source of stress relief in my life that it's really the most comfortable video I could think of making without totally freaking out and scrapping all my plans. So I had a few drinks (it's really quite amazing how brave alcohol will make you), turned down the lights, gave it a few test runs, and finally hit the record button for good. Now, after weeks of recording, editing, experimenting, and uploading I've decided to try getting it out into the public sphere and hopefully - with a little luck - build a bit of an audience to participate in future 'old school' (read: audience-directed) Let's Plays and other audience-driven videos.

While my socially anxious brain would be perfectly fine letting my little project rot among all the other LP's floating around YouTube, my girlfriend is a much friendlier influence on me, and has goaded me into taking the next step - trying to get people to watch, and critique it. So here I find myself, floating in a sea of e-personalities, inviting anybody and everybody to take a look at what could be the most outgoing thing I've done in years. Though my channel is intended for much more than LP's (in the future!), this playlist - the founding project - is perhaps the most important as it will help me to gauge what my potential audience wants to see, allow me to experiment with new methods of getting my story across and engaging my viewers, and with enough viewer input help shape the videos and projects to come :)


Here is ""technically"" the first video... but it's more like an hour-long monstrosity that needs to be removed and crazy edited.
So Unsatisfied's Let's Play Skyrim Modded p.0 (Drunken Introduction)
http://youtu.be/KWz89whcT5s


And here's the ""official"" first video...  much more neat and clean and a 
convenient 15-minute dungeon crawl.
So Unsatisfied's Lets Play Skyrim Modded p1 (The Search for the Dragon Stone)
http://youtu.be/sBTelbJJ-1k


And of course my playlist, which is at the moment up to part 22

https://www.youtube....toQuRHFpgp4SR1W



So yeah, sorry for the huge post, just had to get it all out there from the get-go.  I would absolutely love to hear opinions (and yes, I know episode 0 is crazy long and confusing) and suggestions both through here and through YouTube comments.  Each person who gives one of my videos a 'thumbs up' - I owe you a hearty man-hug.  If somebody's day is so ruined by one of my videos that it deserves a 'thumbs down' - we can still be friends, I guess, but I would love to know what garnered the downvote (so I can fix it in future videos, just for you!).

**Here are 2 of the submitted videos I thought were awesome from last week!**

[McGump vs McGump - Minecraft](http://youtu.be/3mTHbC3ElFE) by BumpyMcGump - You've got some great quality audio and video with this video. The only problems I had with this were the intro, and the first 3-4 minutes. I suggest trying to make a shorter intro, although this is entirely personal preference. In the first 3-4 minutes I was having trouble understanding what was going on, it wasn't until I looked in the description that I understood. Try to make a short 30 second description and read it out so that everyone understands what's going on and then get right into the action.

[Star Ocean: The Second Story (Let's Play) - Part 1](http://youtu.be/BGybP_vjhCo) by Igbarash - Overall you quality is good, although it's not great. I understand that not everyone has the money to buy good quality mics, but I do recommend saving up for one if you're going to be pursuing Youtube as a long-time thing.

*Remember, these are what I thought were good and are a little biased toward my taste of videos. If you have any recommendations from this weeks FF, be sure to message me with it!*

1366428461.0,12,self.letsplay,1cpzdo,Need an intro video? Can make some on request.,,16,4,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1cpzdo/need_an_intro_video_can_make_some_on_request/,"Hey guys, I've started working in After Effects recently and I need more practice so I thought I could help out over here with some intro videos. I'm far from being good at this, but I'm working on improving!         
           
What I'll make will be free of charge and also royalty free, but since I don't have such a big sound library, you guys will have to edit in the audio part (i'll just add you some example audio).           
      
Here are some examples of recent practice works:        
http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXPr6klqWH4mwPS4aug8DLYxDtnIEoIKw                
              
To request one, just leave a reply here with the following info:        
**Video length** (how many seconds should the intro last, I would recommend 5 to maximum 10 seconds)        
**Video text** (what text would you like your video to have? Example: channel name and maybe a slogan or something? channel name should do it though)           
**Style** - I'm still learning, so I can't make any really crazy intros, but if the request is realistic, I can try. You can just ask for example: ""*I want something clean, with the colors red and blue in it, like your Dota Noobs Intro video example*"" , I'm up for anything, as long as it's realistic, I still have no idea how to make some more complex effects.            
            
When I'm done with a request, I'll upload the videos on dropbox or a mega with a preview on youtube (it won't be claimed), video will not be compressed (lossless, so it will be a pretty big file).             
     
If you need more than one video, if I have free time, I can fulfill other requests, but in reasonable time, not sure if I can do more than one request per day.     
So if you're interested, shoot away!              
                              
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~         
**Update**      
April 22nd: First 2-3 into videos should be ready by tomorrow. Delayed due to Game of Thrones + discovering House of Cards :O (aka poor work ethics)          
**Update2**       
Sorry for the delay guys, have been having some issues these past two days, I promise I'll get the first couple of videos out ASAP.          
**Update3**       
Further delays, computer issues, FML! I WILL GET TO DO ALL OF THESE, DO NOT WORRY, BUT HOLY SHIT THESE PAST WEEKS HAVE BEEN ROUGH!             
If you have to make an intro, please go ahead and make one, don't wait on me and my issues. But I will go through all of the requests. I need to buy a new PSU for my workstation before I can get to working again, might take 2-3 days.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,1367876776.0,,,True,t3_1cpzdo,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1cpzdo/need_an_intro_video_can_make_some_on_request/,

Time for Feedback Friday! Post your video and a description of that video in the comments, and then make sure you offer your creative feedback to another person or two! Don't leave anyone out, if you see that somebody down at the bottom is missing out on feedback, check out their video and help them out!

I will be looking through every comment and reviewing the videos myself for a featured spot on the next Feedback Friday post! Don't look at this like a competition though, this is just to reward a couple of people a week for their hard work. If you want to be entered into this, it has to be a video from this week.

**Here are 2 of the submitted videos I thought were awesome from last week!**

[[LP] Paper Mario #33: Troubling Trials and Treachery in the Tower](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1fZP9aIb_Q)  by GamingWithMuffins - I chose this video because there really wasn't a dull moment, the commentator has a great personality for LPing. The quality was great, and so was the audio. Only thing I would really change is the volume of the game, just drop it a tiny bit so it's not so overwhelming. Other than that great job!

[CCC Plays Far Cry 3 - Treatment of Heart Disease, P6](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSUMVW48K0A) by ChrisCourseChannel - I chose this video because I really like the topics that are discussed. It's different for Let's Playing, and if you don't like when somebody just comments about the game and what happens, this is the video for you!

If you normally follow my stuff, I must first apologize for the radio silence. My computer's fried and out for repairs, so I've been unable to access any of my accounts, let alone upload daily!

That's not what this post is about, however. Instead, I'd like to ask for help regarding a charity event I'm going to be participating in. It's called the Relay for Life, and it's put on every year by the American Cancer Society.

Normally, I'd just ask for donations from family and very close friends and call it a day, but this year it's become personal. I lost my uncle last summer to lymphoma, which is a very aggressive and rare form of cancer in the blood. He was very special to all of us, and will be sorely missed for the rest of our lives.

So instead of the usual, I'd like to go above and beyond. This year, I'm planning a 24-hour streaming marathon (of Dark Souls) for charity which would take place on Saturday, June 8. My request for you guys is rather simple: I would be immeasurably grateful if you could share my RFL or Twitch.tv pages (my Twitch is empty because I don't really stream, but I'll be testing out some streaming as soon as I get my computer back). Or, if you guys could donate and/or tune in for a bit, that would be equally appreciated. Any help at all can go a long way!

TL;DR: 24-hour streaming, Dark Souls, cancer charity. Advertisement, plz?

After [this thread] (http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bluce/what_i_wish_would_change_about_this_subreddit/) was posted, I asked for some [community input] (http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1bmm9p/community_upgrade_time_complaints_suggestions/) on changes that you guys would like to see in the community.

As you can see from the threads, there are some really good ideas and suggestions that have been made.

Unfortunately, it appears that the vast majority of the changes/suggestions that people are looking for aren't really things that we (the moderators) can do much about. Well, I guess we could if we were paid to, but real life should always take priority.

So, here's what we're going to do. We're going to modify/clarify the submission guidelines. On a trial basis, we're going to be bringing back the downvote button. We're going to spruce up/modify the sidebar with some highly applicable links.

And... that's about what we can do on our side.

Which is where you, the community comes in. A large number of the suggestions were specific thread types, conversations, highlights of LPers, etc.

And I need you to step up to the plate on these things. We'll support you in it in any way we can (making mod-posts for you, etc) but someone's going to have to take the lead.

I don't think it'll take too much work if we spread it out between everyone.

Here's what we need.

* Someone to run the weekly discussion topic. Select the topic. Send a Mod-Mail Message to get the thread created/distinguished. Edit down the information at the end of the week and add it to the wiki.

* Someone to organize, select and write up the ""Highlighted LPer of the week"".

* ~~Someone to organize the Feedback Friday thread.~~

* A couple of people to collaborate on a Code of Conduct.

* ~~Someone to compile a list of /r/LP's most helpful threads for inclusion in the sidebar.~~

If you'd like to tackle one of these things, and let me know... We'll help you as much as we can.

1365213828.0,11,self.letsplay,1brvu4,"A Few Microphone Options For Those in Need - Low Tier, Middle Tier, And High Tier",jries,15,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1brvu4/a_few_microphone_options_for_those_in_need_low/,"So I know microphones can be a sticking point for a lot of people, but they are a must. Not only for commentary (I mean, otherwise you'd be talking to yourself, not that there's anything wrong with that!) but to enrich the quality of your Let's Plays. A crappy mic can make or break your channel. 

Sounds silly, but given the option of watching a video that has voice audio that sounds like a garbage disposal, or the smooth Canadian voice of NorthernLion, NL will win, every time.

Here we will cover desktop and or mountable  mics. While headsets are fine,  a desktop mic is much preferred for a few reasons:

1. You can position it wherever you please. This means less breathing into the mic, which means less editing out your creepy breathing into the mic.

2. The sound quality is usually better. Don't get me wrong, there are some AMAZING sounding headsets, but most of the time you can't beat the sound of a desktop mic.

3. Pop filters don't work very well on your head. 

I will list 3-4 in each category. 

So, lets get started, shall we?

**Low Tier $0-$45**

If you're really desperate, and bought Rock Band ages ago and still have all the gear, the USB microphone works on PC, and sounds decent.

I find Dr. Seuss, with his rhyming words, is ideal for this.

This helps me in several ways. It warms up my mouth. It acclimates me to hearing my own voice. It trains my tongue on how to move around without tripping over my teeth. :-)

It gives me confidence in my own voice. It helps me to get words from the page out of my mouth faster and still be intelligible. (This helps for those games where the text does not stay on the screen very long.)

It increases my vocabulary. (Okay, not Dr. Seuss, I'll admit, but there are many good books out there to read!)

It helps with the dreaded umms and ahhs and other speech pauses as your brain gets used to *thinking and talking coherently at the same time*.

My goal is to read aloud every day for 10 minutes or so as part of building my skill as a Let's Player.

So what say ye? Do you read aloud to build your commentating skill?

P.S.: In my five weeks of LPing, I have noticed definite improvement in my commentating from my [first video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BISGMvmd8qo) on 11/11 and the one that [posted today](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFaD5jKdEXU). I think reading aloud is the biggest reason for this. 

Edit: I just watched my first video again and what I notice most is how my breathing has improved.

1372101025.0,11,self.letsplay,1gzink,Things to Avoid,GIRTHY_MEATROD,18,7,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1gzink/things_to_avoid/,"What are some things that you think LPers should avoid? Whether it be the obvious like ""bad quality"" or something based on your personal preferences, I want to hear what's good and what's bad to everyone.

Here are a couple things I think people should steer clear of:

* In LPs, too much structure. Now if you're playing a game where it's sort of ""open ended,"" obviously you want to have a plan for the episode. But don't over do it. I can't really give a good explanation, but I've seen LPs that often felt rehearsed or scripted which isn't really good. Have an idea of what you're doing, but don't pinpoint everything you're going to do throughout the episode. Of course, having a good amount of structure in a guide or something of the likes makes sense... but I feel like that's not really how LPs are.

* Blind LPs. I'll probably get a lot of shit for this one, but in my opinion, seeing a person ditz around for twenty minutes while they figure something simple out isn't exactly... fun to watch. Nor do I really care much about the reactions. I'd much rather see a person play well at a game than a person who has more ""genuine reactions."" On the same token, I don't want someone just reciting their knowledge of the game to me. There has to be a balance of knowing the game well and providing entertaining commentary. All in all though, I enjoy series where the LPer knows the game significantly more than series where the LPer is just blindly running through it. (That is of course, unless the LPer is doing a blind playthrough of a game in a series they are familiar with. Like doing a blind playthrough of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate I'd say is acceptable if you've played earlier Monster Hunter games and you know them somewhat well.)

* Games that are always the same. Example being something like Bioshock, where you sit down and play for 8 hours through a linear campaign. The reason I say to avoid these is for two reasons. 1) Relates back to the blind LP thing. If you've already played through the game and you're ""knowledgeable"" in it, then you basically just have it memorized. What's the fun in seeing someone who memorized the game? Likewise, what's the fun in seeing someone who doesn't know the game? It's sort of a lose lose. Whereas if you played something that has varying elements to it (Binding of Isaac, Civ 5, etc.) you can be knowledgeable in the mechanics of the game but not have the game memorized because you'll never play it the exact same way. 2) If other youtubers have done it, what's so different about your LP? Why would someone watch through two series of Bioshock? Whereas with, say, FTL... no run is the same as the other, so two LPers could play the exact same game but provide completely different content.

* Very popular games. Again, piggybacking on the last one, big youtubers have already done it. There's really no point in doing a playthrough of Bioshock Infinite if you're wanting to expand your channel. You probably won't show up anywhere near the top when someone searches it, seeing as it's been played by a plethora of big youtubers. So your subs will see it and that's about it.

* Minecraft. As much as some people will be pissed at me saying this, I know from experience that playing Minecraft is a bad idea. I'll tell you what happened to my channel. I played Minecraft a lot and only uploaded Minecraft for quite a long time. Channel was growing great, getting tons of views, everything was dandy. But then BAM! I decided I don't really enjoy Minecraft anymore, and stopped the series. Now my channel hasn't grown at fucking all in about a year, and my subscriber base is almost entirely dead. Minecraft fanboys, to put it politely, don't watch anything but Minecraft usually. It's a bad crowd to get in your fanbase. You've either got to play it forever or never play it if you don't want to end up with 98% of your susbcribers inactive. Honestly, don't get yourself in that mess.

* Fake enthusiasm. Don't be all bouncy and excited when doing a commentary. If you've got a monotone voice... fuck it, you've got a monotone voice. I'm subbed to a couple LPers with monotone voices because it's relaxing compared to others. I just don't like it when you've started a video with ""HELLLLOOOOOO GUUUUYSYYYYYSSSSSS! HAAAAA WE'RE BACK WITH MORE GAAIMZZEEE!"" As cheesy as this sounds, being yourself is the best way to be entertaining. I'm not looking for who can scream louder than Pewdiepie, I'm looking for who can make enjoyable content.

A lot of these are personal opinions of mine, so take them with a grain of salt. Also feel free to argue with anything I've said, I'm open to hear the other side.

Note: *Please don't downvote people just because you disagree with them. Argue or tell them why you think they're wrong, but there's no need to downvote them solely on the basis of ""wah i dont like that they don't agree with me!""*

1369170213.0,11,self.letsplay,1esexr,Minecraft LP Server - Looking for new members...,neonerz,13,2,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1esexr/minecraft_lp_server_looking_for_new_members/,"**Before I go on, just wanted to say I asked for permission before posting this. I'm also not going to link to the server, videos, members, etc in the main post so it doesn't seem like advertising/spam.**

A few months back my LP server was looking for new members, and I made a post in here. The response was overwhelmingly great, we got a TON of good applicants, and selecting only a handful of members was more difficult than I thought it would be. Pretty much all the new members we accepted at that time came from here.

The people we accepted not only integrated nicely into our group, but some became, what I'd consider, good friends.

Because of how great the turnout was last time, and how many people we had to turn down (only because of limited space) - I decided, before we opened it up for anyone to apply, I'd make a post here and give you all first chance.

**A little about us:**

We are a group of people who focus mainly on Minecraft videos (LPs, adventure maps, PvP matches, etc) but all play and record lots of other games together. Ages range from one or two members who are 16 to about 20-35+ (I personally turn 30 next month). 

With the upcoming Minecraft 1.6 changes we are planning on doing a server reset and starting fresh on the pre-releases. (so knowledge on how to install and run the pre-releases is important, but we can help if you need it). This is a vanilla server. We are working on putting up a modded server eventually, but we have a bunch more testing to do before we move forward with that.

Once we accept a few more players, and we close down applications again, we will do the reset and schedule some type of server opening event. Until then, we'd invite the new members into our skype group, so they could get to know everyone and maybe play a few games.

Again, this is going to be a brand new vanilla server running the latest pre-release.

**What we are looking for:**

First off, age is not important, but maturity level is. This server's primary focus is a place where we can LP, and as such, we need members who can be respectful of that. That means no messing with other peoples stuff (of course jokes and ""pranks"" are OK, as long as they aren't destructive), being mindful that at any point there's probably someone on the server recording, and...for lack of better words, aren't assholes.

We don't care about your sub or view count, but we do care about the quality of your videos (quality also includes personality). All applicant's current YouTube videos will be watched by our members, and that's how we'll make the decision. We made the mistake in the past of allowing people who were new to LPing (new as in, just made a channel to join the server) and none of those people ever worked out. It's OK if you never LP'd Minecraft before, but we do expect you to have some other videos up. Bonus points for people who've been doing it for more than a week ;)

So if you are interested in joining a great group of LPers, a place to play and record Minecraft videos, and are serious about it, leave me a comment below. **Please tell me a little about yourself and link me to your channel.** (I'm only bolding this because of the amount of ""give me the server IP"" messages I received last time)

Feel free to ask me anything about the server, but like I said, I didn't want this to feel like advertising/spam, so I'm purposely leaving out info about the server or specific members, though I'm sure if you check my channel, you could easily find more info.

**P.S. if you applied last time and for whatever reason we didn’t accept you, let me know and we’ll pay special attention to you this time (don’t lie though, I still have my spreadsheet of people from last time)**

**TLDR: Don’t bother, if you don’t have the attention span to read this message, you probably wouldn't fit in anyway**

So, instead of just posting the playlists, I thought it would help the community more to share my experience with working with this form of Alternative Let's Plays.

Before I get into it, if anyone else has examples of other Alternative forms of Let's Plays. Make a point of commenting them below! I'd love to see more experimentation with LPs!

_____________________________________

&gt;**Critical Let's Play:** *A way to organize the content of an LP focusing on analyzing any of a variety of topics within the game being played: story, mechanics, expression, etc.*

For me, I study games and I use Let's Playing as a medium to do that. Each episode I try to engage with a question or an idea or a theme that the particular game presents as I play it.

So, this obviously becomes quite a bit of work. You know what I mean, yeah? We've all got that basic LP structure where we do our thing and then send it off to Youtube, but then anytime we try to add something to that process it takes like a billion more hours than we thought it would to get done... Blugh... 
Putting together these LPs for me has involved:

* Studying the critique around the game (especially Infinite, wow there was a lot of good critique)
* Playing the game and re-watching footage for themes and expression
* Preparing ideas in some way around themes for each episode
* Sometimes that means writing scripts. -_-

This is the pretty standard way I put together my episodes, but I'm definitely not the only person who does any or all of these things with their LP, and these aren't just things restricted to a ""Critical"" LP.

**So how's that stuff working out for ya, buddy?**

Interesting. The workflow listed above has essentially created video blog/LP hybrids centered around a variety of topics that sometimes link to the play happening live in the video, but also sometimes goes on long tangents. So, its a bloated, game critique-centered vlog that shows the entire experience of playing a full game.

One of my original questions when doing this was, *""How are you going to talk critically about a game for THIRTY HOURS? Is there even that much stuff?""* (Borderlands 2 was my test case for this project) Yes, yes there is. One of my best tricks for this is using different lenses to look at games: *""What does this game look like from a [biologists perspective](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oDHTkr36zI&amp;list=PLlbvnAUcEajNx_6snTDRo61wa6NZ7q3EK&amp;index=29) or [another character's perspective](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8k3ZdqgMj9I&amp;list=PLlbvnAUcEajP8uyuu1xc9AsxtRlSFJghV&amp;index=8)""* Using different lenses really helped out to flesh out a game's finer details in extraordinary ways.

**My favorite part** of doing a Critical LP is that I get a good section of [conversational dialogue from commenters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-da8QcXN7M&amp;list=PLlbvnAUcEajOIyt_-X9_6Yh5aJEkm5EA3&amp;index=8) - others who want to discuss the ways I'm looking at the game, challenge my ideas, and really perpetuate critical engagement with the game itself.

**The biggest negative** to this approach (besides the time investment) is that it is hard to stay focused. Analysis a game at the macro level conflicts with things happening in the moment of play, and that can be hecka frustrating. As much as I try not to, I'll leave a point hanging when something happens in the gameplay, and then forget to get back to that original point. OR big thematically rich ideas will be broken up by the 'what was that?' moments in a game.

__________________________________________

At the very least, if anyone steps to LP'ing saying it is just a bunch of kids screaming, you can link to me and I'll tell them: LP'ing is 'serious business'. Because, I think what you all do here is extraordinarily special. As I've [tweeted before](https://twitter.com/SolonCubed/status/335123157163843584), Let's Plays use games and gamespace as an easel for expression, they are artistic forms that examine games in a vast variety of fucking amazing ways. Every LP is special and important, we know that or we wouldn't put this much work into 'simply playing a video game'. What I do with this kind of Alternative LP is not about getting away from the ""status quo of LPs"", they are about acknowledging them and branching directly off from them to explore games in new ways.

If you have any similar examples to what I'm working on, I'd love to hear about them! If you've done work within game analysis, reviews, or critique that involves your LPs in some way, please link it! All of you peeps with other examples of augmenting the usual LP experience (Alternative Let's Plays) LINK THAT NOISE!

There are clearly more YouTubers here than there is an audience to support them, which leads to playlist upon playlist with little to no views and frontpage clutter.

Personally, I believe this subreddit should play a support and information role rather than a place to whore out videos to a wasteland's worth of potential viewers. Quality should be the focus here, not views and subscribers.

____

##[Current Remedies]:
* Enforce a strict layout for each playlist submission.
* Enforce a tagging system and a title format in order to better differentiate post from post.
* Only allow Playlist submissions on a particular day, such as  Friday or Saturday. (Free time for all and feedback more likely)

___

##[Strict Layout]
As [DuffKing56](http://www.reddit.com/user/duffking56) recommended:

1. Channel name

2. A description of the channel (1-3 sentences is all I'd think is needed here)

3. The episodes being posted with a 1 sentence description for each plot-wise or topic-wise since some do topic-based content.

4. Evaluate why you're posting the series or series'. This should be done for each series. This will give you and the reader a better chance to understand the point of the content and you may learn a thing or two about your objectives as a content creator. This point I think gets lost in the mayhem of recording, editing, and uploading and needs to be in the limelight at all times.

5. What were your objective for the week and where did you find trouble or find success in attempting to meet them. Here you'd incorporate constructive criticism from weeks previous and more self-assessment would be performed here.

6. Did anything interesting happen to you this week related to content, or, what surprised you? What did you learn that you can share and what did you change from last week? (Not to overshadow the ""What did I learn this week"" post but since these occur more often than that and it doesn't have 100% participation I think we may as well maximize our opportunity to learn through others here).

7. Where do you hope to go from here? This forces one to recognize a pseudo-goal for the coming week and is a source of motivation and reflection to last for the week.

If the post did not follow these guidelines to the teeth, the thread would be removed - making some semblance of quality and post readability standardized.

___

##[Strict Tagging] 

I am mostly concerned with how the front page looks. I feel more like I'm sifting rather than happily surfing, these suggestions may enhance readability and ease of use. All playlists should follow the below format or be removed.

**[Playlist][Game Name] [Your irritatingly creative title]**

Ex: [Playlist][Tetris] It's Rainin' Blocks!

____

##[Playlist Submission Dates]

Only allow playlists to be posted on certain days. Such as ""Let's Play Friday"" (Then channel critique Saturdays) or something of a similar caliber. This makes the majority of the discussion revolve around tips on enhancement and general quality awareness. 

I'd rather have a daily post that people ask how to increase their quality and subscriber base, than having each individual user make their own thread and get no help whatsoever.

___

To be totally honest, I'd like all three of the above to be instated to some degree. Standardization is something that serves to benefit a community. How fun is it to sift through a big pile of tangled adapters and converters looking for the one that you want? For me, that's how browsing this subreddit feels.

I am here mainly to give my opinions on the network. 

Disclaimer: You may have seen some of the stuff before because I am copy pasting some stuff in cause I'm lazy.

I am actually partnered through Socialblade so I could get access to their support and their spotlight as well, but, Socialblade uses RPM as the partnership program so you are a partner there as well, if that makes sense (if it doesn't let me know).

I really like them. They are really active on their social media and their support is excellent. I haven't had issues with their support. I been a member for about ~5 months and so far so good.

I think they are definitely worth looking into but they may not be right for you. They have a one year contract but the payment split is 60% for you and 40% for them. They now offer a 50/50 plan and the contract is for two years. I personally don't know how you qualify for which. When I joined only the 60/40 planned was offered.

 Now while it is a huge cut in the 60/40 contract, the contract is only for a year which isn't that bad. But, if you feel like that is too much money then you will probably want to look somewhere else.

As for the 50/50 cut I can't talk too much about it because I don't have experience with it, but for me that isn't worth it, it is too long of a contract for such a heavy cut. 

Their promotion is nice. ~~Especially if you partner though Socialblade/RPM because you have the ability to submit a video for Socialblade's partner spotlight as well as RPM's partner spotlight.~~ No longer an option. Socialblade has (temporarily?) stopped the Socialblade partner spotlight.

RPM also hosts ""watch-it Wednesday"" where you can link them your videos on twitter and they will pick some to feature on their facebook page.

RPM now hosts a ""RPM Spotlight"" which is similar to the Socialblade spotlight, but it only comes once a week on Fridays, instead of daily.

What is cool about RPM is there is the ability to graduate into some of the higher networks, such as TGS or Maker Studios. I don't actually know what encompasses going about this or graduating into another network. But I imagine that what it does it is allows you to have less views than normally needed to join the network. But don't quote me. I haven't seen an example of this in person so I can't point you in the direction of someone.

Overall I think RPM is great, and he was good for someone in my situation who had been in a stalemate of growth for a good 6-10 months and was hoping to change something up to increase views and sub count. 

However, it is important to remember that networks aren't for everyone and aren't always the best option so make sure you know what you are getting into and double check to make sure being part of a network is something you need or something you may think you just want.

*edit*I have noticed some very engaging content and some that ignores the audience, both can work, but the ignoring has to be done in a fashion that still immerses the user. The overall look and feel of your page also plays a big role in this, you really want to create a tone that is welcoming or says something about you. I feel like i'm learning a lot in doing this and will continue to share as I go. Thanks!

*FINAL EDIT*
well i made it through all the suggestions ..wow.. Lots of very great stuff you guys are doing, I hope my suggestions or criticisms help you out in one way or another (its at least 1 view!). I found some guys that I really find entertaining and have subscribed to them (name is Greenwoodthree). Thanks everyone for the upvotes and to the people who down voted this, seriously? Anyway, thanks guys have a great weekend!

Also there have been some requests for my youtube so here that is.

We want to meet people like us, that just enjoy posting their Let’s Plays, and growing our own small community. In this website you’ll be able to post your current Let’s Plays to grow your audience, as well as ask for constructive feedback and even look for collaborations for your Let’s Plays.

I hope you’re interested in checking this website out, it’s a little empty, as we just created it, but as soon as people start joining, it will be a great community place for Let’s Players and video game lovers alike to showcase their great materials! I hope you decide to join, as I know personally I can’t wait to watch everyone’s material, as there’s nothing quite like watching people talk while playing Video Games!

The question kind of hurt me because in the haze of arguing with the users on that forum, I had kind of forgotten the answer and was worried about my reasons actually being selfish and egotistical.

So the question made me feel like shit, first, then it made me start to think, hard, searching desperately for reasons why I wanted to let's play. I searched and searched my mind, but alas, possibly due to the haze of feeling like shit, I couldn't think of a single good reason. I started to doubt myself. Perhaps I was being selfish. Perhaps I shouldn't be doing let's plays. 

Then my mind did something funny. Instead of coming up with reasons I wanted to let's play, all it wanted to do was list the personal reasons that I loved LPs. I didn't want to at first. I was like ""What the hell are you doing, mind? Don't be selfish like that. You need to come up with at least one good reason to let's play, not a stupid list of pointless things."" But my mind insisted, so I listened and made a short list of some of the various things that I loved about LPs. Here is said list:


&gt;I love it when LPers get nostalgic about video games and talk about how they reacted to certain monsters or levels when they were kids.

&gt;I love it when they go off on tangents about personal history, public history, philosophy, adventure, game mechanics, movie opinions, and all sorts of other things that have nothing to do with the video game in question, yet are so interesting and engaging that they still add to the gameplay, and I love that moment when they realize how off topic they are, sometimes by the game itself letting them know (them dying, or being surprised by something unexpected, for instance), as if it were alive and a part of the audience. 

&gt;I love it when instead of going straight from point A to point B like some cogs in a machine, they stop and look at the flowers, or fool around, or try to break the game, or try to do a completely pointless maneuver game-goal-wise just because they think it would look cool or be fun or be hilarious (think of tossing grenades to flip trucks in halo 2; does anyone remember doing that? did no one ever do that besides me and my relatives?). 

&gt;I love it when they make mistakes, and they get angry and frustrated about their failures. 

&gt;I love it when they think they've finally gotten past something and beaten it when, at the last second, they end up failing, and how mind-inducingly angry it makes them. 

&gt;I love it when they finally actually succeed, and they're so happy about it that you can hear the cheer or relief in their voices. 

&gt;I love it when they do the voices for the characters in non-voice-acted rpgs with a consistency that makes me believe that their voices are the characters speaking. 

&gt;I love it when they give shoutouts to fellow LPers who they think could use some more attention, and I love the friendships, collaborations, and fun pieces of banter that arise from doing so. 

&gt;I love it when they have such an appreciation for the music, the art, the story, the gameplay, or any other part of a video game, that you can hear it in their voice and tone, and they sound like a little kid who just got a ""NINTENDO 64!"" for Christmas.

And then, the answer to the question came to me like magic:

&gt;I simply want to make LPs that incorporate the things that I love LPs for, so other people can also feel that love. That is why I Let's Play.


Not only did the answer come to me, but the haze of the intense argument I that was having with, frankly, insulting people vanished into thin air, and I no longer felt like shit. I felt great. I felt like I wanted to make a let's play then and there. It was amazing.

Seeing how joyful I felt after I completed the list, I thought perhaps making such a list would do the same for you, so....

What do you guys love about let's plays? What are the moments you cherish the most? Feel free to make a list or write a paragraph or write an essay or whatever you want.

I do a lot of Dwarf Fortress videos aswell on top of the other things, although those have become more obscure as of late due to a waning interest, but it's not a game to force oneself into, so it should be back in it's own time.

You post a link in the comments below to your LATEST VIDEO, I will assess, review and give advice on how to improve. I have seen my fair share of LPs so I think I have an idea of what makes one great. 

Reasons for doing so:

- I want to start an LP soon (first one) and want see all the little nuances that make an LP great as well as the ones that make it not so great. Also I want to train myself to avoid the bad ones.
- I am bored and think it will help some of you out
- I want to make myself feel better, so if I like the video I will comment and like it.
- Feedback Fridays seem to have disappeared and nobody seems to be getting any comments
- Four points seem like enough, don't you think?


Anyway good luck.

It's one of those things that might not seem like it's that important, but once you start doing it you'll notice a difference in fan interaction (ie. comments) and audience retention (views per video).  

There's two things I'm gonna be talking about with respect to an upload schedule: frequency and consistency. Frequency will refer to the sheer number of videos uploaded and consistency will refer to the amount with which those uploads stick to their expected timeframes. For example, if a channel released 1 video every week on Wednesdays, it would be consistent but infrequent. If it released 10 videos every week on random days, it would be frequent but inconsistent.  

In my opinion, the 'ranking' of channels in terms of audience engagement would go like this:  

**Consistent and Frequent &gt; Consistent OR Frequent &gt;&gt; Inconsistent and Infrequent**  

I think it's common sense that, if all other things between commentators are equal, audiences will prefer a channel that uploads often and at expected times versus a channel that does one or the other only, and they'll greatly prefer either over a channel that has infrequent videos uploaded at random times.  

The exception to this rule, I think, is for a video series that has high production values like Egoraptor's [Sequelitis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpigqfcvlM). These videos are infrequent and inconsistent but that's because they require a lot of work top to bottom (scripting, recording, animating) and he can get away with it because the finished product is so good that people will seek it out whenever it's made. For most people producing LPs, though, you should at least be consistent **or** frequent (not everybody has time to do both.  

Anyway, that was just to explain why uploading consistently/frequently is important. Now let's get to some tips which will help you increase your output and stick to an uploading schedule.  

**Tip 1: Set a release schedule for your videos**  

This doesn't necessarily mean you'll know exactly which videos will go on which day, but you should decide how often you want to upload. Some options would include: 1 episode/day, 3 episodes/week (M/W/F perhaps), 1/episode a week, etc. You get the picture. It's important to set a realistic upload schedule so you can stick to it. Don't pick 1/episode a day if you can't stick to that semi-reliably. Advertise on your channel what your upload schedule is so people know when to check back for content.  

Now, for sticking to this schedule.  

**Tip #2: Record in Batches**  

Rather than recording one video, rendering it, then uploading it right away, record as many videos as possible in one session. For most people, recording time is limited because you want to do it during a time where nobody is around to disturb you and you're not disturbing anyone else with your narration. So, if you have a 2 hour block of awesome recording time, record the video/narration for 3 or 4 videos so you can render them all out at your leisure. For most people that will be close to a week's uploads all in one fell swoop.  

**Tip 3: Render/Upload Overnight**  

If you don't have a ballin' computer, rendering can take a long ass time. I'm currently LPing Dark Souls and the 20-30 minute long episodes take 2-3 hours to render which can seriously throw a wrench into your production schedule. After you've recorded a bunch of videos, the way around this is to render videos overnight. If you record 4 videos on Sunday night and your release schedule is 3 episodes a week, you have time every night to render the video without actually having to be there to watch it.  

You can do this for uploading too although I'm not sure if non-partners can set their own publishing times. It's not a huge deal but generally I'd prefer to publish my videos at night rather than 3AM EST.  

This is yet another reason why recording in batches is so useful compared to recording 1 episode every day.  

**Tip #4: Build a Video Bank**  

So you've just recorded an awesome video but you've already uploaded your standard 1 episode for the day, what do you do? Well, most people will just upload it right away because that shit has to get up ASAP because it's gonna go viral and make them a YouTube superstar. There's nothing explicitly wrong with this and everyone falls victim to it, but you're better off building up your ""video bank"".  

What I mean by this is, any time you're way ahead of your schedule (ie. you release 3 episodes a week but you have 6 already rendered and ready to go), **don't upload the extra videos** no matter how tempting it might be. I've been guilty of this so many times and inevitably what ends up happening is I release extra videos then a week or two down the line something comes up and I can't meet my standard release schedule, whereas if I'd saved those extra ones it wouldn't be a problem.  

This isn't a huge deal but trust me when I say that it's really comforting to have 10 videos made in advance so that if anything unforseen happens, you can probably still meet the expectations of your fans (no matter how big or small your audience is).

1372054893.0,13,self.letsplay,1gyd6l,One Simple Tip Helped Me More Than Double My Subscriber Count in One Month (And You Can Too),asher1611,17,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1gyd6l/one_simple_tip_helped_me_more_than_double_my/,"This subreddit is a great resource and has plenty of prominent LPers and YouTubers passing through.  And sometimes you will get golden gems of advice that alter your LPing perspective.  Like many others, I am always looking for ways to grow my channel, and in one discussion a number of wildly LPers gave, in a sense, the key to their success.  There was one over arching theme, and that theme has been a guiding principle in how I approach my channel ever since.

So what's that tip in the title? 

As per many successful LPers, it's simple: **be in the right place at the right time.**

Oh, you thought this was going to be easy? 

There are copious amounts of literature and publications discussing how simple flukes or strokes of luck can have a huge impact on our entire social structure.  YouTube, believe it or not, is not particularly different.  There are many LPers out there chasing the Golden Egg that is ""the next big thing.""  And if you're paying enough attention, it's actually not that difficult to look into the tea leaves and get a sense of what games could be big for LPing in the near to distant future.

But that's the catch.  Being in the right place at the right time actually has a third element.  A hidden element.  One you may or may not already know: **preparation.** If you have not put the work in to be successful, then you will blend right back into the background with everybody else despite being where you are supposed to be.

So what does preparation mean? Practice.  Even if no one is watching, practice.  Ask specific questions.  Ask for specific advice.  Don't just say, ""Hey watch my video what do ya think?"" Instead, go into a video or a series looking to improve, and then work on improving it.  Is it your commentary? Your delivery? Your ability to play while commentating? Your A/V fidelity? Editing time? Tagging? Set goals, stick with them, and achieve them. Always work to improve.  Your viewers will notice and appreciate it (even if they don't always say it).  

So there's my few cents.  Is my channel still small? Yes.  Is this post worth a hill of beans? Probably not.  I don't think I've said anything controversial, and probably not even anything new.  But by really focusing on preparation, I have managed to dramatically improve my content.  Subscriptions are up and views are improving, but maybe the number I am most proud of is that my audience retention has skyrocketed -- people are starting to stick around and watch my videos.  If I had not worked so hard on improving the quality of my product, I doubt that would be the case.

So for those of you who might just be starting out at LPing, know that the early days of wondering, ""Is anyone watching this?"" is an incredibly valuable time for growth.  Use it.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,1372055108.0,,youtube,True,t3_1gyd6l,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1gyd6l/one_simple_tip_helped_me_more_than_double_my/,

The idea? Pick a game from below (they are either free, cheap or old) and make a video.

You have around 7 days to make the video - in a week, we'll post all of them in a thread for feedback, advice and discussion on filming those games. 

Test yourself, produce a video you might not normally have made, and help others improve and learn. I guarantee I'll give full feedback to anyone taking part, so you know you'll get a least one big piece of feedback!

If you don't make videos, watch out for the feedback thread next week and help us pick games this weekend!


**The (SIMPLE) Rules:**

* Pick a game from below and make a video. The video can be anything you like. It doesn't even have to be an LP, you could try doing a review, an impressions video or just about anything else providing you pick a game from below.

* Test yourself! Pick a game you would normally have never filmed, or take a game you might enjoy and do something a little different. This isn't about views, it's about improving what we do together.

* We're looking for one video, with a length of no more than 30 minutes (Ideally around 20). Obviously if you want to go ahead and make a 200 hour long series afterwards that's cool, but for the sake of the jam, a single 20 minute video will be sufficient.

* If you take part, remember to check back and take part in the feedback next week. Not only will you help others but you can also learn a lot from giving feedback.

* Drop a comment here if you intend on taking part or have any other feedback / suggestions.   
 

**The Game Choices:**

1. [Vox](https://indiegamestand.com/) - Voxel adventure and RPG game that looks vaguely similar to Minecraft, avalaible for $1 or more at IndieGameStand.

2. [Data Dealer](http://datadealer.com/) (Demo) - Data Dealer is a web game about privacy that's currently in [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cuteacute/data-dealer) mode. The web demo hasn't had a lot of YouTube coverage and is totally free to play.

3. [Flashback](http://www.giantbomb.com/flashback-the-quest-for-identity/3030-1066/) (Retro) - Any version of 1992 platformer. The PC version should run well through Dosbox, or you can pick up a console version directly or through emulation.


**Uploading:**

* Upload your video as normal to your own channel, but please stick a RedditLPJam1 tag in there so they can be easily found in the future.

* You can upload your video as unlisted if you don't want it to interfere with your main channel.

* Once uploaded, drop me a PM with the link before Tuesday at 8pm GMT (4pm EST).

* Don't post your video here before then - leave the feedback for the thread at the end of the week.


**Dates:**

This Saturday we'll post a thread to vote on games for the next round so I'm not picking them each time (Thanks to /u/Phedran for feedback on this).

Next Tuesday we'll post all the videos in a single discussion thread like Feedback Friday.

Next Wednesday we'll post up the next round of games.



**Taking Part:**

/u/Wayward1 - Probably going to try Data Dealer as I like the concept and have never filmed a web game before.

/u/ArpinArp - I think I'll give Flashback a try since I've never played it before

/u/agdan - I'll give Data Dealer a try as it seems like a great concept. :D

/u/Phedran - Attempting Vox

/u/AndresIndoril - I might give Data Dealer a try, simply because I want to join in this event of eventfulness!

It's called Data Dealer, and to put it very succinctly: it's like running your own PRISM or data empire.

""Become a data dealer and get all the dirty details on your friends, neighbors and the rest of the world. Learn how to trick your users and make cash with their personal info! Legal? Illegal? Whatever.""

If it makes you feel warm and fuzzy to do something to help people, we're a nonprofit and we're hoping the game will teach people about the dangers of privacy... that said, it's a game, and it's sarcastic and hilarious, and it's meant to be (and is!) fun.

When your community is small and you want to grow with like-minded people. You won't do it simply by adding restrictions to limit the folks who are exhibiting behavior you don't want to see. This has been a huge down-fall I've seen with countless online communities that I've worked at and even built myself. It breeds rule-nazi's and elitists... And nobody but rule nazi's and elitists want to hang out with rule-nazi's and elitists. 

To effectively build your community and eventually see the participation you want to see, you have got to make connections with the like-minded people. INITIATE contact with them. Make them feel welcome as if you were hosting them into your house. I get that many online community people are introverted and that this type of behavior may not come to you naturally. But you have got to do it.  Give folks the sense of belonging and feeling like showing up was a good idea. 

Since I've been a member of reddit, I have not experienced what I'm suggesting in any of the gaming-related subreddits. I've found the typical rule-nazi's and elistists (and a handful of cool people), but it's been rare that someone has gone out of their way to make me feel welcome in these subreddits. I'm not thin-skinned, so it doesn't bother me, but other people may be a bit more sensitive to this issue. 

Work on your hosting skills -- Identify the folks who model the behavior you want to see here and connect with them -- And incentivize the behavior you want to see.

If I'm watching an LP by a new person, there are a few things that turn me off immediately.  I'll start with my most common three reasons.

1. Long intros. I can't stand them. Really only will sit through 5 seconds for a new person.  Maybe at most 8 seconds if it is someone that I like or the intro is so well done that I don't notice how long it is taking. But usually whenever I see a slow animation that takes forever to finish, I close it if it isn't done in 5 seconds.

2. Commentator seems bored or has no energy. I mean, if you didn't have any fun playing it, I don't see myself having fun watching it. Yes, sometimes it is just because they are tired from work. I've had some pretty low energy videos when I was sick. But it is still a big turn-off for me and I avoid making videos like it.

3. Audio sounds like really loud constantly. Sure, I could turn down my volume just for those videos but turn it back up when I stop watching your video. But I rather not usually.  Because I don't have to do that for plenty of other media.

First, visit your channel, or one of your own videos. Click the ""analytics"" button. http://i.imgur.com/zjjt2h.jpg?1

I do, however, have a few questions for the bigger channels out there.

My first question is how did you get your content out there for people to see? You can be the best and most entertaining person out there but if your content isn't seen by anyone then it wont get anywhere. Did you just keep posting videos and they eventually caught on or did you find communities where you could get your name out there?

Another question I have is how did you get better at making Let's Plays? Were you a natural or did you use some method of improvement? How long did it take you to get to your current level of entertainment?

I'm sure I have more questions but that's all I can think of for now. If anyone else has any questions feel free to post them as well.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,youtube,True,t3_wq3te,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/wq3te/questions_for_the_bigger_lets_players/,

LehanBeard [had a good idea to give shout-outs to others' LPs](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/wjbpt/a_proposal_for_the_community/), ignoring self-promotions.  So I thought I'd post some of my favorites:

* [**Let's Interactively Play Morrowind, with Veriax**](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF42E442C3E955206&amp;feature=plcp) - Veriax plays through Morrowind, and he picks a suggestion at random for what to do next.  A neat way to apply a Let's Play with an open-ended, open-world game

* [**Dragon Warrior Series Let's Plays, with Saigancat**](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEFEE430A20B0DA11&amp;feature=plcp) - a longtime fan of the series and avid collector plays through the Dragon Warrior Series (He's done I and II, working on III, I linked there because it's active/current).  Lots of interesting Lore and Dragon Quest background thrown in.

 
* [**Let's Play Oblivion (Badly), with Gameplay Jenny**](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2377C18AB8466E27&amp;feature=plcp) - a humorous approach to a great game.  She never uses Strafe though..... argh.  Always good for a laugh.

&gt; Is there a way to adjust the threshold for when a link stops being relevant to the front page? I know reddit uses an algorithm that balances upvotes as well as age (for example, a link that is older, but has more upvotes will eventually fall down the page in favor of newer stuff) but is there a way to adjust this value on a specific subreddit?

&gt; I do believe the subreddit has problems with clutter, with people linking individual episodes of their LP because it's the only way to get noticed. Someone may spend 2 months completing an entire LP, and link just once to the playlist, but nobody gets to see it because 40 other people are posting links to just their individual episodes.

&gt; I think the moderators should decide once and for all how they want things done here just so everybody has an equal chance of getting upvotes and recognition. If there was a way for links to stay on the front page for, say, a week as long as they have enough upvotes, I think that would be the best thing for this subreddit.

&gt; *-Anonymous, unless the sender wishes otherwise*

**TL;DR: The over saturation of individual links is causing many submitters to go unnoticed.**

What is your opinion?  Should individual episode links be prohibited?  Should playlists be the only acceptable way to submit a Let's Play here?  What would be a fairest solution for our ever-growing community?

Last Weeks Lessons

**Last Week's Lessons**

*Highest Scoring Comment*: Our top comment comes from /u/OhSnapLP who I had the pleasure of playing Payday 2 with last week. [Check out his channel if interested](http://www.youtube.com/imakelevels) 

&gt;1. Pay attention to your analytics and your traffic sources when attempting to advertise. I posted a weekly update here and got a whole 2 views (average of 4 seconds view time). Hurraaaaaaaaay... *cough* Adjust, and try something new instead of continuing failed methods of advertising.
2. Eh, minor techy learning thing for me, personally, about remoting into my computer at home, from work, and doing video renders. I'm using an old version of Vegas movie studio that doesn't have batch rendering. More time spent rendering when I'm not even at home means more time available to record new content when I *am* at home.  

*Jon's Choice*: My choice comes from user /u/Phedran, who hits us with 3 points on what she learned. [Come check out her channel if interested](http://www.youtube.com/phedran)

&gt; * Just ask (nicely) / Just try. You never know what could come of it! Alternate version: If you don't ask, the answer will always be no.
* If you're restless and having trouble focusing, go do something else. Go for a run, get out of the house, just don't wallow in frustration. Come back re-energized and ready to create.
* Sometimes you just have to rest, and being sick is one way your body makes sure you do. Don't push yourself too hard.

My worst comment was simply a guy asking why I made videos if they don't get any views. When I replied by saying I did them for fun, he coldly said that I should stop because I'm not as popular as PewdiePie or something to that effect.

While mostly related to the methods of making videos or improving quality, real life lessons are also welcome too.

**Last Weeks Lessons**

*Highest Scoring Comment:* /u/ishyvideos gave us a lesson that while applied to ""Let's Plays"" can be applied to everyday life. 

""As stupid as it sounds. I've learned most recently to stop overthinking everything. Just play the games I want. Relax. Have fun. Then put myself myself out there to the public. Once you stop fearing failure. It relieves a lot of excess weight off your shoulders. Understanding that everyone will not like your videos, and that is okay. As long as you are enjoying the games you are playing. Playing/recording how you want to. That is all that matters.


Basically broke through a lot of mental barriers this week.


Wish everyone the best.""

*A Personal choice From Jon:* /u/OhSnapLP helps us articulate our words to help us get our thoughts across. 

""Vocal warmups help. I'm still 'finding my voice' so to speak, and I talk through a tongue twister poem type thing before I start recording. Everytime I do it, I feel a bit more confident with my commentary.

Everytime I forget, I end up tripping over my words at some point.""

Here is my most recent Last Light episode: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57VL4EM-PiA  
It's slow at first since we're stealthing and I'm thinking hard, and I tend to quiet down to fit the characters position.

It's also worth noting that this video was after recording the game for perhaps 8 hours on launch day. Not an excuse, just... I really wanted to keep playing.

* As for my channel:
My whole... thing is the highest video and audio quality I can possible provide. After about June of 2011, I built a very high end machine and everything since has been 1080p without fail and I've improved my workflow and production techniques to produce higher quality results with the same or less time. I've gone back and forth whether the polish I put on a video is worth the resulting traffic or whether I should simply lower my standards a bit to put out more videos faster. I usually bulk record and edit over time. I try to be regular but I occasionally go a few days without an episode. 

* As time goes on I feel like my videos are getting better, but are progressively being viewed less. I thought this might be a problem with youtube or perhaps my subscribers simply did not care anymore so I opened a second channel to merge all of them into the second channel for those that want to watch them. But all my current LP's will finish on this channel.

As much as I don't like to hear bad things, I'm obviously in need of help because I feel like people either tell me, ""I don't like Let's Plays"" or ""You're doing perfectly"" and I can't really work with that.

I did my best to format the post in a way where it isn't overwhelming.**  

I have noticed that most of the people who post in this subreddit do so solely to just advertise their channel. There is a smaller percentage of people who post in order to ask for criticism. Then there is an even smaller amount of people who visit this subbreddit in order to actually find new people to subscribe to. I myself have no interest in beginning my own channel, but I was thinking of all the problems that new youtubers face when they are trying to grow. So I thought about this idea for a website. This website will serve as a hub to concentrate all potential viewers in one place.  

**Some features of the website.**  

*Search/sort by style.*  

I will categorize all let's plays by style. Either informative, expressive(loud), mature, humorous, sarcastic, co-op, group, completionist, challenges, blind. A user can search on the site with certain keywords to discover new Youtubers. They will also be suggested new LPers according to the style they enjoy watching.  

*Search/sort by specific video game.*  

You like Binding of Isaac, Black Ops, Kerbal Space Program, etc? You can just search a game title and you will receive a list of all youtubers (who are archived on the site) who have played that certain game. You will then be able to sort this list by play style and other things to better match you with the type of videos you enjoy.  

*Search/sort by genre.*  

You like FPS, Puzzle, Racing, Indie, Horror, etc? You can search by just a genre and will receive a list of games tagged with those. Click on a game title and you will be presented with a list of youtubers who have/are currently playing those games.  

  
**Each Youtuber member of the site will have their own page** where your social media links can be posted along with links to each episode on your channel. Each channel will also have a spot for your subscribers to give you input. There will be one of three sections to comment to. 1. Random: this will serve like the normal comment section of youtube where the viewers can comment whatever they want. 2. Requests: This will serve as a place where viewers can request what games they would like to see or any other requests. 3. Critique: Here the viewers will be able to give their criticism on how you can improve. The purpose of these different sections will be so that you (as the commentator) can more easily sift through the comments. I believe this feature will prove to be more beneficial as your channel begins to grow and start to receive too many comments to view them all.  


**Home page:** There will be a ""highlight reel"" that will play a 15 second clip of your channel that I will combine with other clips from members of the site. The total highlight reel will be 5 minutes total. I will post a new highlight reel twice a week so that new users that come to the site can see the best you guys have to offer. These 15 second clips can be funny, bizarre, or whatever you want to show in order to try and pull potential viewers to your channel. As each 15 second clip plays, it will have your youtube channel name and episode number along with it so it would be easier for people to know who you are in such a short amount of time.  



**Main Benefit:** Will help small/new Youtube Commentators grow in size by concentrating all potential viewers in one place.  

The only places currently that commentators have to advertise are either on their own FB or Twitter, or on forums. FB and Twitter won't lure people in that don't already know who you are, they serve more as a place to inform the subscribers you already have, not gain new ones. That leaves forums which tend to have a very small niche market. Having a website like this that serves as a hub, I feel is the best way to gain exposure. If every member of the site adds a graphic, description, or briefly talks about the site, then they can help add potential viewers to the ""hub"".  

*Example:* ""Member #2354"" has only 50 subscribers. ""Member #4233"" has 200 subscribers. ""Member # 3424"" has 1000 subscribers. If each of them adds a plug for the site (during their videos or description), they will all be contributing to the potential viewer list for everyone else. Technically, the smaller your channel is the higher your potential will be to grow. But that doesn't mean that the channels that are bigger will be hurt by it. It will help them get recognized just as much. In the end it will be the content you provide that will keep potential viewers subscribed to you. This website will mainly serve as a hub to group viewers all together for you.  

Hopefully that makes sense. This idea will only work as long as all of you here advertise it because the more viewers that find their way to the site, the more potential subscribers you will get in return. When one channel grows, it will potentially help all other channels grow as well. Like I said, the main problem each channel faces will no longer be the lack of exposure, but will be keeping the potential viewers entertained. Think about the amount of potential subscribers you can gain if this site would really gain in popularity. Doing it this way means that we will all grow together.

**Criteria for being on the site.**  
Well I thought that the best thing would be to add some sort of criteria in order to keep the website as active as possible. I think the only thing that a channel needs to have potential, is good quality audio and visuals. Whether you are funny or entertaining is all subjective. So as long as we can hear and see everything you are playing, you won't be turned away. As well as maybe a 5 video minimum to show that you are persistent even with a low subscriber count.

I am sure that there are many more features that can enhance this type of website that I haven't thought about as well as some ideas that I may have forgotten to list here. So tell me what you guys think about this idea. Would it make a difference? Is there a website already out there that does this?

I’m a gamer. And I love to play games. It’s something I’ve always loved and will continue to love until the day I die.

- **Yeah, but who the fuck are you?**

I’m an almost-22 non-graduate unemployed man who really hates the idea of working a dead-end 9-5 job for the rest of my life without anything else to give my life meaning. I don’t want to be a sound engineer. I don’t want to be a computer scientist. Hell, I don’t even want to work on video games anymore. I don’t give a fuck what I do, but I know what I do want to do: I want to talk about video games on the internet, play video games on the internet, and have a hell of a time doing so. Because I fucking LOVE video games and I want to share that with anyone and everyone who wants to listen.

- **You and everyone else, meatbag. Why should I give a fuck?**

Because I’m raw. And I don’t mean raw as in edgy or intentionally angry at everything all the time. I mean I don’t censor, and I don’t hold back. I’m me, because that’s all I know how to be. I don’t deal with bullshit nor do I dish it out. If I play a game, I tell you what I think of it, simple. I play the games I want to play, and I enjoy the games I enjoy. There is no agenda other than mine... I don’t have time for that shit. I honestly don’t have what it takes to be someone that I’m not. I can’t imagine sitting there in front of a camera and putting on an act to appeal to more people. It leads down a path I have zero interest in. It’s take it or leave it; like it or don’t with me.

I am me. I am a gamer. I love playing games and I want to share that part of me with everyone else.

Yeah, probably to some people that’s what it sounds like. But I don’t honestly care if that’s what some people think of me. I know who I am and what I say. If nobody likes that, then nobody likes that, I give up on this, and I move on. Thing is, I think that I am, at the very least, an interesting person when it comes to video games. Talk to me about something else, and I might be a little tight-lipped. Video games, though? I can go on all day. Like I said, this is my passion, and I know a lot about it. I’m not THE most knowledgeable person, I don’t pretend to be. But I think I’ve got enough that SOMEONE out there might like what I have to offer, and want to listen to what I have to say. 

And yeah, I can see how that might sound a little egotistical. 

- **Yes, yes it does.**

Watch me. Get to know me through the work I do. I can say that I’m a great person all day long, but the best thing I can do is prove it through what I do. So that’s what I’m going to do. 

- **Okay Mr. Perfect, what makes you such a special goddamn snowflake?**

And therein lies the problem, right? What do I have that everyone else doesn’t have? 

Not a whole lot is the answer. A wise content producer once said to me that “who you are is unique, what you do isn’t”. I’m a guy making video game content on the internet. Who isn’t? I could just stop right there. I could say “Whelp, it’s an oversaturated market and there’s no point in any of it.” And I almost did. 

Then I thought of how bad I’d feel if I just gave up before I even tried. And I mean REALLY tried. I’ve done this before in spurts but I gave up before I even gave myself a chance to grow and get an audience. 

So fuck that. Fuck giving up because this is what I want to do.

What makes me a special goddamn snowflake? 

Me. I make me a special goddamn snowflake and a snowflake worth something. I’m not at that point right now, but the only person or thing who’s going to make me worth something is myself. I have to push. I have to make myself stand out, and no amount of bullshit is going to help me out on that one. It doesn’t matter what game I play. It doesn’t matter how I act. The only way I’m going to succeed at this is if I stick to my guns, be the best me that I can be, and let my work speak for itself. Because I can do this. This is something I know, deep down, I can do. I just have to work at it.

- **So... WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?!**

I’m Time Glitch. I’m a gamer, just like the rest of them. I’m nobody special. All I have is me, and that’s all I need. I’m not going to quit, and I’m not going to flake out. Not anymore. It’s all or bust. I am going to be interesting. I am going to be insightful. I am going to produce high-quality content with a passion behind it.

I don’t do this for the views. I don’t do this for the popularity. I do this for me.

- **DO IT. DO IT OR THIS ALL MEANS NOTHING. PROVE IT.**

I know. And I’m not going to wait any longer. The planning starts now. See you in the spotlight.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,1368028895.0,,youtube,True,t3_1dxq8x,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1dxq8x/i_wrote_myself_a_motivational_document_this/,

I shared this quote today on my facebook. Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors so this is perfect for me. These words inspire me to move and never stop. I'll show you just how effective this mentality can be..

My highest viewed video is this: http://youtu.be/QqilYpOfx7Y 
My channel: https://youtube.com/user/MikieGames 

I made the video out of frustration..so I had a little fun and I didn't give a shit about what anyone thought. The video has mixed feedback. Some viewers love it..and others hate it. But how are you suppose to keep moving forward if you never take a chance and worry about criticism? 

This quote has pushed me to make more..surprising content that you don't see everywhere. You have to have thick skin to make videos. So the faster I felt this..the better I became. And the more fun I had. I keep this mentality in all my videos.

I am not saying don't care about what your viewers want or be cold. I appreciate every little view I have and constructive criticism.  But it is so important to do w/e you have to do..for YOU. Think about what or who YOU love. And I promise you..it will work. 

More important than any video, I keep this mentality in all my life.. 

I hope this motivates you..youtube is so small compared to your life :)

Could someone who has some experience doing a LP give me a step by step guide, how they started exactly what they did? Becuase I really have no idea where to start....

-OR-

Could someone point me in the direction of an IAmA that will go through all this? 

I have like no money but have a good laptop so purchasing a recording program isnt very feasable so freeware or super cheap programs are the best for me... I'm not too worried about production quality (that will get better as time goes and I get better at the whole process)

please help me I really wanna do this as it will keep me from going insane with this broken leg, and after it's healed hopefully I will be quite good at this hobby...

Games I would like to do LP's with...

Resident Evils (starting from 1 all the way to 6)
Wrestling Games (preferably the older ones but maybe a few new ones)
Minecraft (of course who doesn't do a minecraft LP)
Old school Nes/Snes/Genesis others (probably on emulators to start off with until I learn how to do a ""from the tv recording""

The only problem I have ran into now is that the video seems to run away from the audio as the video progresses, so the audio by the end of the video is a little lagged... not sure how to fix this i will have to figure it out eventually... but yeah you guys let me know what you think when I get the link up....

I'm up to almost 250 subscribers and I grow a little everyday.

I spent the last week building a PC and trying to get it up and running and working out the tweeks. I was so excited to start LPing on it I managed to get an early copy of FTL and preordered Borderlands 2.

Unfortunately one of my RAM sticks was defective so I wasn't able to post videos until today. After everything was fixed I decided to make a video explaining why I hadn't posted videos over the last week and asking for suggestions as to what to play next (because I didn't have a gaming PC prior).
 
I also went on to list games that I had already picked up such as FTL, Borderlands 2, and Dark Souls: PtD (I had already LPed the xbox version but wanted to cover the new content because I love it so much).

Within 10 minutes I was called a copy-cat of Northernlion. I watch NL and respect him a lot; he was the main reason I got into LPing. I know that a few (or most) of our games overlap but I figured it was more an overlapping of interests not copying.

It was a comment that cut me deep both because I respect NL and because I have been trying very hard to differentiate myself from other LPers.

So I guess my question is this: How do I differentiate myself from other LPers? Should I ignore this guy or does he have a point?

**TL;DR - I have been called a Northernlion copy-cat. How do I differentiate myself from other LPers?**

I had planned to do one, but more in the style of 'Etho' or 'BDoubleO' rather than the 'act like a derp' kind of style. I agree that mc is a bit overused, but what do you think? I was also thinking of playing games like 'No more room in hell' and doing random TF2 montages to some power metal/something to get you stoked.

Third - What's a good way to get known? I know some people tag 'bluexephos' and so on, but I don't want to do that.

I ask this question as a person that plays through video games while recording them.
I often look at my views and wonder to myself, ""Why do you watch my videos of me playing games?""

Is it because you want to see the whole game?
Is it because you find the commentary funny or the playing skilled?
Are you trying to learn something by watching?
Do you watch in hopes that I fail miserably at my task of completing it?

My Favourite Let's Players .... The ones I watch almost every day are

PlumpHelmetPunk - His storytelling abilities are almost out of this world. And he has some crazy whitty comments :P. He does not really edit too much either. Also find PHPs Dwarf Fortress LPs amazing

Sleepyjo2 - I am unsure as to why this person is one of my fav LPrs but maybe it is because he is just ur average Final Fantasy gamer ... and a friend ... but it really entertaining to watch and streams almost all of his recordings. Since he streams he doesnt really edit too much out either.

GrimithR - What can I say about Grimith other than INCREDIBLY funny. This man is without a doubt one of the funniest LPrs I watch atm. He is funny mainly due to the fact that he rages at himself so much or the game :P. He is also incredibly good at civ IV. I dont think Grimith edits too much either mainly due to the fact that he is ""lazy"" lol

And Lastly Quill18 - I just enjoy Quill's overal commentary style and the fact that he is constantly playing new games that I have never seen before. He is also a DF player, but I dont really enjoy his DF LPs :P.

1344850622.0,11,self.letsplay,y4yu0,Tagging 101,Qieth,12,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/y4yu0/tagging_101/,"**Introduction**

I wanted to write this little guide to help people produce better tags on videos. Why? Because tags matter, that's why!

You might get a bunch of views from friends and family, but the real way to drive people to your channel is by showing up in searches and in related videos across Youtube. Wait, let me correct that: Showing up in relevant searches and relevant related videos across Youtube. We'll get into that later.

**Why tags matter**

Tags is what Youtube use to figure out how people are going to find your videos. Tags will bring new audience to your video, and if you do tags correctly, then people will find your video because they were looking for that kind of content, and that means they are likely to check out your other videos as well.

It might be nice to get a few views from linking your video on Facebook, but if you want to grow your channel, you need to make your videos available to people who actually like to watch the content you produce - not just your friends who only watch your videos because you make them.

**Sexy girl bikini topless free money**

I keep using that word.. relevant. Why is that, you ask? Well, if you want to use proper tags, you will have to find some tags that people are likely to search for if they are looking for the kind of videos you produce. Put yourself in their shoes: ""I want to find a Let's Play of Portal 2"". What are you going to search for? That's right: [Let's Play Portal 2](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Let%27s+Play+Portal+2&amp;oq=let%27s+play+portal)

If I'm out looking for a Let's Play of Alan Wake, then I am not likely to search for ""Alan Wake topless girl"", am I? Of course not. I'm going to be searching for things relevant to what I want to see.

Whats worse, these kind of tags might actually hurt your channel! Let's say you want people to see your newest Monkey Island video. You realise that Minecraft is a popular game, so you figure a lot of people are searching for Minecraft. You put Minecraft in the tags, hoping that someone will search for ""Minecraft"" and stumble upon your video.

Big mistake! Let's go back to that word.. relevant. Youtube will rank videos not only based on video views, but also audience retention - how long you keep your audience on your video. If people watch a large portion of your video and continue to watch some of your other videos, or even continue browsing content on Youtube that is not yours (ei. your videos didn't make them leave Youtube), then you will be rewarded with a higher ranking in the search history.

But if someone finds your Monkey Island video when they were searching for Minecraft, then they will watch 10 seconds of it, realise that this was not what they were looking for, and leave the video. Youtube will notice that people don't stick around on your video, and then they will display other videos before yours. I am sure that people don't have to watch your full video (I upload 15-20 minute videos, and I get great search rankings), but my best guess is that you would want people to stick around for at least a couple of minutes.

Bonus: Add skip-annotations to later parts in your video and add links and annotations to other videos to keep people searching through your content.

**Making good tags**

Alright, now that we got all the boring stuff out of the way, let's look at what you really want to know! I have made a template that I use for all of my videos, which is quick to edit for whatever series you are using. I shall share this sacred knowledge with you here:

--x--

GAME NAME

""GAME NAME""

""let's play GAMENAME""

""GAMENAME walkthrough""

""GAMENAME gameplay""

""GAMENAME commentary""

""GAMENAME pc gameplay""

blind ""let's play"" lets play playthrough walkthrough ""video game"" tutorial

GENRE SPECIFIC TAGS (action, adventure, horror, scary)

GAME SPECIFIC TAGS (writer darkness light guns shooting firearm ""episode 1"" nightmare)

--x--

Copy this, save it somewhere, and edit it to fit your video. I run a gaming channel, so my template obviously reflects this. Replace GAMENAME with the name of the game, and change GENRE/GAME SPECIFIC TAGS with something relevant to the video.

You might notice the two first lines:

*GAME NAME*
and
*""GAME NAME""*

Why does this matter? If you don't use quotation marks, Youtube will treat each word as a single tag. That might be fine for games like Minecraft, but when you have games like Alan Wake or Monkey Island or even Call of Duty, then you need to do both so the words are considered tags both individually and as a whole.

Here is an example of the tags I used on a recent project of mine:

Quantum Conundrum ""Quantum Conundrum"" ""let's play Quantum Conundrum"" ""Quantum Conundrum walkthrough"" ""Quantum Conundrum gameplay"" ""Quantum Conundrum commentary"" ""Quantum Conundrum pc gameplay"" blind ""let's play"" lets play playthrough walkthrough ""video game"" tutorial puzzle portal dimension slow heavy fluffy ""Professor Q"" ""Airtight Games"" ""Square Enix"" ""Kim Swift"" Fitz Quadwrangle Steam ""Square Enix""

You get the picture, I'm sure.

**End notes**

So there you have it. You are now a pro-tagger, and not the kind that gets chased by the cops for vandalism! If you have any more tips for tagging, be sure to share them with everybody else.

being an avid gamer for about 15 years I found myself not having too much time for video games once I got a job and had to manage my household. With what was left of the day remaining for gaming I appreciated it even more - the difference between being able to play 10 and 2 hours a day is quite significant.

Realizing how important gaming is in my life the logical step was to try to do something more professional with it. Having done multiple gaming related videos in the past, taking it to the next level was an interesting challenge. Having an idea, I started my own channel November last year. 

After working on my idea for a couple of weeks I had to admit that I had bitten off way more than I could chew within my timeframe - resulting in me dumping my initial idea. Several weeks past but the idea of doing something more professional stayed. 

As I follow the gaming scene regulary I knew a lot of ""Let's Plays"" and the, unfortunate, bad stigma it has attached to it. Though I didn't want to just ""start playing and recording"", there was something to find, that would make my content different. 

For years I've enjoyed completing games to 100%, achieving perfect saves, so I based my main idea around that. Thus came forth my first idea of the ""Perfect Tale..."" series. Starting with GTA III, one of my all time favourites I knew I had a lot to say about the game, making it easier to start. My first video was released on the 17th April. 

Shortly after the first episodes there were more things I wanted to do, getting my opinion out there about things that are important to me (of course gaming related) were the next thing on my mind - resulting in the ""Fish Tale..."" series. 

Now, three months later I finished my first project and figured that it is important to stay in contact with the community. Thanks to reddit I could improve the overall quality of my videos, i.e. the tags on my videos, resulting in an overall better feeling about the quality .

Being at 3 Subscribers and 201 Views I feel confident about my channel thus far. A new series ""Endless Tale..."" is in the making where I play games that have no ""real"" end - think about games like Faster Than Light, Rogue Legacy, The Binding of Isaac and the like - roguelike games.

Now you might wonder why did I even make this post. The reason is that I fear that once my channel hits some rocks and won't progress I will only see the negative things going on. Thus this post will be some kind of a diary with (hopefully) monthly updates to keep me on track and keep myself motivated.

If you want, you can follow me on my upcoming adventure and see how I achieve my current goal - being within the Top 5000 YouTube Channels based on subscribers. Meaning about 100.000 subs. That I want to achieve by new year 2015.

Brain hits white noise and I'm just struggling to think of something funny, insightful, anything, and just sound like a mess. I see alot of ""Be Yourself"", and that is all well and good, but I believe that ""Being Yourself"" is a more of a subconscious thing. If you begin to consciously act like yourself. You become some sort of a parody of yourself. Like Christopher Walken doing Christopher Walken for example. Everything is overthetop. .That is how it has been with me.

I'm starting to realize that in order to be success or at least ""be myself"". I have to go in with a clear mind. Realize that there is no stress here. Nothing to lose. Just play the game and go with the gameplay. There is more to this I'm sure, but this is just my take on it.

This is what I know:

Flattr is a service for sending **voluntary** micro payments to sites that you like. You do this by pre-paying money that you would like to spend, and then setting a monthly budget in euros. The budget is split between any sites or people you Flattr that month.

Until March, this has been done by going to a participating site (one listed on Flattr's directory or one with a widget) and clicking the Flattr button. However, [*since* March](http://blog.flattr.net/2013/03/launching-new-flattr-add-money-to-your-likes/), they now hook up to various services like Soundcloud, Flickr, etc. and now YouTube to automatically Flattr participating users when you star, like, or favorite videos.

We need to gather together and hammer something out, but, in the meantime, we're excited to read about all of you awesome people. We really hope this takes off, so the community can become more than just a dump site.

**EDIT:** Okay guys, the OPs deliver:

All of us are students, ranging from grade school to college, so we all don't have much income or free time. As far as personal introductions go, I, Zach will go first, followed by Alex, and ending with Richard. 

-------

Hey, everybody. I'm  Zach, and I run the tech and editing for SchlomoGaming. 

I'm 18, and computers and electronics are a major passion of mine. I learn that sort of stuff fairly quickly, so I suppose I kinda have a knack for it. 

I knew Alex and Richard from school, though I never really started talking to them until about a year ago, when Alex and I started chatting on Facebook. 

One day, I was watching some Haunting Ground playthroughs, and was disappointed in the lack of thoroughness that could have been there. I decided that I could try my hand at making one, but solo recording was too difficult, and I found that the whole thing wasn't really for me. 

I told Alex about it, and he told me that, coincidentally, he had also been planning on doing something similar with a friend. After a while of prying, we decided I could be part of it, and the rest is history. 

My favorite games to play are games like GTA, Dark Cloud, Soul Calibur 2, and Haunting Ground. I prefer to play on emulators, because I really don't want to spend extra money on a capture card when ripping your own games onto you computer is free. :p

I never really did before, but I'm starting to enjoy watching all of your LPs. I can't wait to read all of your guys comments. 

-------

Hello, my name is Alex and its great meeting you all! I’m 19 years old and one of the three members of SchlomoGaming. 

While I’m not as skilled as Zach in the editing/tech department, I try to make up for it by contributing to the channel in any way I can. 

Video-games and entertaining people have always been a major interest of mine, and SchlomoGaming has given me an oppurtunity to express myself in those forms with two of my best friends. I believe that as long as the three of us make some quality content that we're all satisfied with and have fun doing it, then it's all worth it, you know? It's all about making something cool and sharing it with my friends and the internet.


The whole idea started one day while I was hanging with Richard, who has been one of my best friends for a few years now. I had been going through a really shitty time in my life; Some serious drama went down at my High School and long story short, some nasty rumors were spread about me and I lost almost all of my friends because of it. I met him whilst sitting alone one day being down on myself and we immediately hit it off. Our senses of humor really complimented each other and we shared some great laughs together during those lunch days. 

So, one day while we were chilling at my place and playing videogames together and goofing around like we always do, the thought occured to us ""This might be cool to watch or something."" I had always been a fan of Let's Plays and videogames in general, but I never really knew where to start. So, the idea for the channel had been floating around in our heads for a good while when I happened to talk to an old acquaintance of mine about it. 

Zach had shared a few laughs with us during those times at the lunch table, but I hadn't really ever gotten to know him very well. I had always known that Zach was funny and a pretty cool guy. I had no idea that he not only was an experienced and successful Youtube-Pooper with experience in editing and a knowledge of the technical end of a channel, but he also was thinking of doing a gaming channel as well.

-------


Hey, wassup everybody. I'm Richard and I'm one-third of Schlomo Gaming. More then anything else my favorite thing to do is make culture joke that no one gets(especially Zach.) 

From movies to video games, I am an encyclopedia of useless knowledge that comes out as an obscure reference. I'll even admit right now that I talk too much and hope something I say is funny but I'll do my best to control that and make sure only my best jokes end up on Youtube. Well that's about all I have for you right now so for now I hope you enjoy what we put up and I personally hope you get at least some of my references that I make, peace out.

I think improving our wiki is the best way to improve r/Letsplay.  All kind of amazing information is scattered throughout this subreddit, but its haphazard and there is very little quality control of the advice.  Collecting it in a central place which is moderated by the community will help all of us.

1. It will help new people who can become lost in a maze asking the same questions over and over.  
2. It will make it so regulars and experienced LP'ers can focus on more detailed questions because there will be less time spent answering the same questions over and over again.
3. It will grow a wider base of knowledge about the technical aspects of Lets Playing, meaning more people can contribute constructively to help find solutions and new innovations for issues that arise. (Utilize the hive mind!)
4. It will make /r/Letsplay the premier place for technical information about how to make let's plays.  Something which from my experience has either been behind a paywall (Something Awful) or in a community that didn't care about people they weren't friends with.
5. It will bring in other experienced LP'ers who currently don't come here because they don't think there is anything for them to gain, again growing the knowledge base we all share.


In direct response to Bubbleking87, limiting achievement posts and feedback threads is good, just as we have done with spamming new episodes.  Shameless promotion is annoying at times, but heck, this is a place to promote LP's.  Finding the appropriate line for shameless promotion is something the community needs to figure out, but unless someone wants to step up and moderate everything we just need to accept it.  I personally don't think our time should be spent on nit picking whether or not someone crossed the line with shameless promotion, but thats just my call, and I will go with the community on this one.  Finally, saying we need a litmus test for people to come to /r/Letsplay and ask for advice is appealing to filter people who pop in, plug their channel, and never show up again.  However I think denying people who haven't been here a while the opportunity to post freely will make us into an unfriendly place for new comers.  I don't want to see this subreddit become that.  I like it here because it is open to all people, of all levels. I know that I have taken some of Bubbleking87's thoughts a little farther then he did (he never said litmus test for example), but that was the feeling I go from it so that's what I went with.


My main point is that the best way to improve our community, is to focus on improving our knowledge base.  The wiki is ideally positioned to be the receptacle for all the great knowledge all of us have gained over the years, months, or even day's we've been at this awesome hobby.

When you are a small youtuber it is hard to get noticed, so much so that some people resort to spamming their friends and family with their videos and possibly getting themselves in trouble in online communities for ""self promoting"".

This passage was aimed at someone looking to promote their churches YouTube channel but this is all still relevant to letsplayers. 
 
----------------  

There are plenty of articles on the net on YouTube SEO (Search Engine Optimization) along with some helpful tips and tricks you can use to your advantage. below find a cheat sheet:  
* The name of the video before you upload **IS** important (Mov2236.avi is a **bad** thing to name that file)  
* Focus on one keyword or more realistically phrase per video.  
* don't name your videos ""Sunday sermon 4/28/2013""  
* Use YouTubes search feature to find popular keywords. if you start typing ""how to save"" and it offers the suggestion ""how to save my friends soul"" that is a popular keyword and will net you more views through search.  
* Your title, description, and tags are your ""important"" trinity on YouTube, if you are trying to rank for a keyword that keyword or phrase should be in each of these places.  
* take the time to include a transcript of the video, it makes it easier for YouTube to crawl your content for relevant topics.  
* LINKBACKS this is the thing people always forget, YouTube is a search engine, it does reward a video for being linked from other relevant sites. link your videos from the church website and or other faith based communities that might appreciate your content.  
* as some people point out video age is an important key however you can beat age with relevancy. I have beaten out older videos by using these methods and I'm sure that in time you can too. I hope this helps and I wish you luck in your endeavors.

2. Don't be too close to the mic. Then it picks up eeeeeeeverything.


3. Don't upload videos at 11:00 pm. Nobody will watch them right when they come out, which will tank your views if you're a newbie (like me) (hence the ""What did we learn"" segment).


4. If you're going to link reddit to your cahnnel, make sure you've provided the right link. REV UP THOSE FRYERS.

A PSP game! Madness! Growing up I played more than my share of Mega Man X on the SNES and I really wanted to do a series on it however it's so overdone on Youtube I was hesitant. That's when I decided to hook my PSP up and play the remake! It's a great remake too with completely remade graphics, remixed music, voice acting, anime sequences, and they even added a playable character! Admittedly I'm not the greatest at MM games so those of you who enjoy me making a fool out of myself expect it more than usual!

For about a year now I have been making small let's play series over on my channel, it contains the pretty basic set of let's plays that you could expect from a small time youtuber trying to find an audience. I firstly started with Minecraft as it was the easiest thing I could think of doing (as well as I could post the videos on the ""Minecraftforum"" site itself. I've always had brilliant feed back from my videos comments that always lifted my spirits with the regular ""Your videos deserve so much more views"" and ""Your commentaries remind me that of &lt;Insert Well Known Youtuber Here&gt;"". 

After which I decided to try and branch out and do more things, League of Legends matches, small machinimas. I've always enjoyed experimenting and putting stuff to decent sets of music as well as my regular commentaries, I love to livestream and actually involve myself with the community/audience I have.

I'm roughly around 390 subs to 400, I can never tell as it goes up and down like there's a few indecisive people just hovering over that subscribe/unsubscribe button as they watch my videos mentally judging me after each witty or not so witty comment.

I reckon I have potential to be big, or funnier, or better in what I do. But I need feedback from newer, fresher faces. My PC recently broke and now there will be a month or so before I can get back into videos, so what would be awesome is to have some more people looking at my older or newer videos and giving me some helpful advice.

Before you do check and comment on my stuff. I no longer like to have silly long intros or outros that scream at you to subscribe to my things or like my stuff, they were all tests to see if I could get more from people if I just asked, but it did seem that people didn't really like the more pushy nature coming from my own personality.

So if you would like to take the time out and watch a few of my videos, or hell, try and watch the near 150 videos I have and let me know how i'm doing or what I could do better. I would be really appreciative of it.

I'm calling it Channel Raid (brilliantly witty, I know) and it's an idea that I would like to see spread in the community.

So what is a channel raid? It's a call to your subscribers to have them check out, or raid, another person's channel which you enjoy. The goal is to get the word out about channels you like that don't have a large sub base. Given that your current subs probably have a least some respect for your opinion, many will probably check these channels out.

To be clear, this is NOT something I'm suggesting for this /r; ie, no posts of ""We should raid this person"" or ""Can you guys please raid me?"" This is for our own channels to focus on other LPr's which we feel aren't getting the attention that they should.

For those of you who have never heard of Retsupurae, they're two old hats from the Something Awful forums who find bad LP'ers and make fun of their content. (It's kinda like Mystery Science Theater but meaner) Some people seem to think that Retsupurae is acting as ""LP Quality Control"" and while I don't think that's Slowbeef and Diabeetus' goal they do seem to have that effect on certain corners of the community indirectly.

That being said, my question to you guys is whether you agree with what they do. Multiple LP'ers have been forced to pull their channels and quit making videos due to the (Sometimes hundreds) of Retsupurae fans who flood them with hate comments, down votes, and general abuse following being featured on the show. Then again, others have turned the ridicule into a publicity opportunity and have grown substantially as a result of it. So at the end of the day, is this the sort of thing that the LP community needs? Or is it just an inevitable byproduct of a heavily inflated hobby? I'm a bit conflicted on how I view the whole situation, and when in that situation I like to discuss it with people. 

I look forward to hearing from all of you :P

I'm sure everyone is super busy with their OWN content and real life (psh, real life!), but I've noticed that a lot of people have been talking a lot about themselves...compared to helping others. 

In retrospect, I've done this a lot in the past year and I'm trying to change.  In fact, it's one of my resolutions for the New Year (both in LP'ing and in my personal life).  The main point I'm trying to hammer down is:

**WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ENGAGE WITH YOUR AUDIENCE AND OTHER LPERS?!**

I'm sure most of us make videos and focus only on our own content, but how do you go about interacting with one another?  Do you post somewhere blindly? ...without offering much in return?  Well, if you were like me...change your ways because I assure you this is **such a good thing to be doing.**

For instance, I've met some great people in the past year just making videos with little engagement, I would say 4-5 quality people.  Now, in the past month...I would say I've spoken with 10 quality people that I look forward to interacting with them.  (These are some cool people that I look forward to watching their content, and offering feedback...while they do the same for me)

**SHARING IS CARING** ...not sure how to take the first step and talk with other people?  **START WATCHING OTHER PEOPLES VIDEOS AND COMMENT!**

Be constructive &amp; be NICE (no one likes a grumpy guss).  

Trust me, along the way...you'll meet some badass people.

1357973588.0,10,self.letsplay,16fe9f,720p or 1080p? [PROTIP INSIDE],HomerSPC,11,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/16fe9f/720p_or_1080p_protip_inside/,"As requested [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/16d9va/need_some_tips_on_compressing_and_making_files/c7v12za):


I always see people ask if they should upload as 720p, 1080i, 1080p.  So, I'll give the simple answer.  Upload, render, etc. at 720p.  The reasons behind this statement is pretty simple:

1) The demographics of people who: a) have a internet speed fast enough for 1080i/p, b) actually watch 1080i/p, and c) can tell the slight difference between 720p and 1080i/p are so small that it is insignificant.

(Addendum to b) Most actually watch 480p and never even go to 720p. 

2) 720p videos are smaller in filesize and upload faster.  I know for myself at least, a 720p video takes 3 hours to upload, and when a 1080i/p video is much larger than a 720p video, that upload time will increase dramatically.

3) (Addendum to 1c) As said before, the difference in 720p and 1080i/p is so insignificant, unless you have a large monitor and watch every video full-screen.  On a 1080p monitor of average size, the difference between 720p and 1080p is very slight.  This is because of the pixel density in the screens.  It will appear VERY SLIGHTLY more sharp, but that's it.  Not many people do that.

4) The kicker: Most YouTubers have no idea how to properly export a 1080p video.  Many people try converting a video from 1080i into 1080p, which is not possible.  If you have a 1080i video, downsize it to 720p.  You won't lose quality, guaranteed.  **If you ever have an i video, always downsize the resolution to p.  Never try to convert i to p in the same resolution**.


There is always those people who will upload 1080p, because it seems ""more professional"".  Yes it's good to stay with the times, but even though 1080p is actually quite common on television sets, YouTube and internet speeds have not grown far enough to demand 1080p videos.  

Never fall into the trap of thinking your channel isn't getting attention because of your video quality.  Only a few years ago did the internet only consist of 360p/480p videos.  The thing which set them apart was audio quality.  A video can be very visually unappealing, but still attract your attention because of a clear and crisp audio.  Audio will always be the most important thing of a video.

Anyways, it's quite late and I'm tired.  Let me know of any questions you guys might have down below and I'll try to answer them to the best of my ability.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,youtube,True,t3_16fe9f,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/16fe9f/720p_or_1080p_protip_inside/,

If you guys feel like this is spam, I'll remove it.

I know how a lot of you feel about Minecraft, but I know there's probably plenty of us who do play it. 

There's been a lot of talk lately about working with others to increase your views/subs as well as just having a good time. I run a small tight-knit LP server with about 9 of us (4 or 5 who are very active), and we decided we wanted to bring in some new blood.

Even though we all revolve around Minecraft, we play a lot of other things together (people usually group up together for different games. For example I know there's a few people actively playing Castle Crashers and Dungeon Defenders). 

The server itself is running the latest version of vanilla Minecraft. It's a real server sitting in my data center in NYC (not just an old Packard Bell I have laying around the house). We don't have any age requirements, but we definitely do have maturity requirements. If you seem cool and mature, you are in. I don't like the idea of age requirements because I've met 13 year olds who were more mature than friends my own age (I'm 29 btw). Since everyone on this server records, we expect you to respect other peoples builds and keep mindful of when people are recording (as not to ruin their videos).

The players range in age from about 14 (there's about two or 3 people under the age of 18) to 33, mostly from America, but we do have one britt. We try to do group events when we can, but we all make it a point to keep in contact (we have a Skype group), and are always there for each other when we need someone to play with.

If this is something you are interested in, leave a comment or send me a PM. I also request you check out an episode on my channel, or link through to some of the other members and watch them. You feeling comfortable with us is just as important as us feeling comfortable with you. [Here's a link](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL08921F9D65530F39) to my LP Playlist for this server. You could check the description of my videos for links to the other members.

Like I said, we don't have an age requirement, but do have a maturity requirement. As such, we expect everyone who wants to join to already have a YouTube account and some videos (doesn't have to be Minecraft) up that we could watch and get a feeling for you. None of us have a really large amount of subs (we range from a couple dozen subs, to a couple hundred. No one has over 500), but we are all dedicated LPers. We will not base our decision on accepting you or not by your sub or view count. So if you are completely new to LPs, just make a YouTube account, and upload a quick video. That will allow us to not only check out your personality, but also your recording quality.

(Actually, already stopped... it's nice to have a backlog of videos sitting in the scheduled publisher.)  Little sad, too, since I'm 30 hours in.

Also recently started an [Ironman Classic run of XCOM: Enemy Unknown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSCeCr3fu0o&amp;list=PLHf426G6f2gkBVDP6CV1bdRsIiwNaRCcE&amp;feature=mh_lolz). I loved that game to pieces on my first playthrough (Ironman Normal), so I doubt I'll experience the same burnout.

The second is [TotalBiscuit](http://www.youtube.com/user/totalhalibut). I know, I know. A lot of people don't like him and he can be a bit outspoken at times. *However*, he's the guy who made me interested in how the gaming industry works.

I've recorded a couple of different sessions so far and have ended up scrapping them because I found my commentary/gameplay boring and/or the settings were done incorrectly. 

How did you guys get up the initial courage to fully produce your first episode? How did that episode turn out? Was there anything you'd wish you'd done differently?

Secondly, I have two major questions for you fellow Let's Players:

1. At the moment, my channel looks horrible, (all unfinished let's plays), so I became curious about how to make a good let's play channel, like so many others on this subreddit. So I decided to join Reddit to get some advice. I've always found it interesting, looking at the first videos of popular let's play channels. Sometimes the audio is horrible, or the video is just someone pointing a camera at a screen, yet somehow people stick around. Just wanted to know what others' opinions are on the ""redeeming qualities of a let's play"". For example, if the video quality is horrible, but the commentary is hilarious, would you stick around? Why are some let's plays that are just people talking over the cutscenes, not knowing how to play, and generally, just sucking, super popular these days?

2. I've always been super uncomfortable with my voice (which is super manly, and horribly monotonous), and the fact that I'm a girl gamer (I really hope I don't sound like a whiny ""Girl Gamer over here!!"" person). I've never known anyone in person who was as into video games as I am. Even the guys. So I recently (June 2012) decided to gather the equipment needed to create a let's play channel. My goal was to find others who were interested in the GAME. Not just the views. I wanted to find people who actually wanted to comment and talk about the gameplay, not just write things like ""sub 4 sub!!?1!"". I can't livestream due to a horrible upload speed of about 0.60 mbps (0.70 on a good day), so youtube uploads have been my focus. I've semi-gotten over my voice, and just decided to dive headfirst into a bunch of games with the hope that people could share the same interest and opinions on these games, but all I've gotten are sub 4 sub channels. How do you go about finding people without spamming the hell out of other channels?

Lastly, if anyone does end up reading this, my channel is here: (http://www.youtube.com/user/LosstPyjamass?feature=mhee), if you want to give CONSTRUCTIVE criticism about it.

* Test out recording and see if everything will work fine or if I'll have to fix something and try to find a workaround to make to solve those problems.
* Make a few test recordings.
* Work on graphics, like channel background and stuff.

In the blog article, there was an embedded YouTube video of the declassified US footage. That video was hosted on talkingsticktb's YouTube channel.

[At least a few people](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/z4zag/til_that_in_1962_american_scientists_detonated_an/c61l22u) that went to the video page were confused by something in the bottom right of the description: ""contains content from tseriesbhakti"". I'm sure most of you are familiar with what that means, but for anyone outside of letsplay, it means that tseriesbhakti claimed that the video contained his copyrighted material, and that YouTube allowed it.

[Tseriesbhakti](http://www.youtube.com/user/tseriesbhakti) is an Indian music artist. This is a video of declassified US nuclear tests. Fishy, fishy, fishy.

To confirm what everyone was thinking, I messaged talkingsticktv to inquire about the copyright claim from tseries. As it turns out, talkingsticktv uploaded it without placing ads in the video. Tseriesbhakti saw this and claimed copyright on the public domain footage. Nothing illegal here, technically. However, **there's nothing talkingsticktv can do to get the claim off the video.**

Talkingsticktv uploads a lot of public domain footage, so this isn't the first time that a video was sniped. In the past, they tried to contest the sniped video copyright claim to get the ads off, and **received a strike against their account.** This is completely unacceptable. If I host content on my channel, I want to be able to control that content. I don't want a large YouTube network partner coming in and taking a proverbial crap on my front lawn, and when the police show up, they hand *me* a ticket.

**TL;DR:**

* talkingsticktv uploaded a public domain video to their channel
* It made it to Reddit front page
* tseriesbhakti claimed copyright on the public domain video that is hosted on talkingsticktv
* tseriesbhakti is currently getting all of the ad revenue from that video
* talkingsticktv can't do anything about it, because the last time they tried, YouTube/Google gave their account a mark

This of course would be with the games with two versions like fire red and leaf green. So my first thing is does the dual cast and dual screen idea sit well with you guys also next thing is for some of you who don't know what a nuzlocke is it gives you the ability to lose in pokemon. In this case I thought when one of us goes down we then move onto the next game with two versions and just keep it going like that. This would be our first lets play ever so we're new to the whole thing but ready to jump right in. I would like to hear everyone's advice and opinions like if you don't like the dual playing and would prefer just two separate lets plays that maybe reference each other. I'd also like to know what recording software everyone recommends and how much it all costs and things like that thank you.,,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,,True,t3_wdej7,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/wdej7/so_i_have_an_interesting_idea_i_just_need_some/,

La Mulana re-releases on July 13th and brings with it a slew of changes and new features with it.

Top Archaeologist/Ninja Professor Lemeza Kosugi is packing his green backpack full of his green archaeology notes, his whip, his green adventuring hats, his green adventuring clothes, and enough teleportation curry to send the lower half of the United States to the moon in preparation for his trip to La Mulana, a land said to be the source of all civilizations.

I'll be going along to document his travels in a special LP. For those that can't wait and want some La Mulana now can check [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1yP_be9IyI) or my playlist for the 2005 original **[La Mulana](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FE7067FB328CC0C)**.

So. I'm a totally new Letsplayer, and I want to do two things. The first is that I want to introduce myself to some other LPers. First off, I'm a totally immature 18yo guy from Vancouver, Canada. I'm into a lot of different kinds of games, although I'm partial to RPGs in the vein of Final Fantasy and such. Like I said, though... Diversity. I'm hopefully going to be spending some time here on /r/letsplay and get involved in discussions/advice giving/general blabbing once I get myself sorted.

Here comes the advice-needing part. Now, I know you're all going to say it's overdone (because it is), and I know you're all going to say I should start elsewhere (because I probably should), but my first LP is a Pokemon game. The reason for that being that I want to do something of a beta-test LP. I know Crystal pretty well and I have the editing knowledge to make it less boring than you might expect. My influence in my editing style is pretty obvious, and I'm already super worried about being called a ""chugga"" copycat. That's where you all come in...sort of. I'm not coming on reddit to ask you to create my identity, but I want to hear other people's experiences with being compared to popular LPers (negatively or positively).

I've only posted two videos and I've only had my channel for two days, so I'm not expecting to be super unique or popular, but I think I can improve. That's what Pokemon Crystal is to me. A place to hone my editing skills and develop confidence as a commentator (because let's face it, I'm a nervous wreck in my two videos). To be clear, I'm not one of those ""pokemans"" kids who is only ever going to LP pokemon games. I'm not trying to build my fanbase around this LP, but I want to do the best I can. If you think I can make my Crystal LP more funny/entertaining/informative, definitely give me your opinion. However, bear in mind that I'm committed to the LP and I'm planning on being very diverse in the games/genres that I delve into.

So, /r/letsplay. I'd love to hear your stories on comparisons, and your (constructive please) critique on my channel which can be found [here.](http://www.youtube.com/user/lv1chris) BTW, tips on audio mixing and gear are VERY welcomed.

Thanks so much everyone for making this an awesome experience. Hope everyone has a safe and fun new year!

**Original**: Hi everyone, one of the Arcen Games guys here. To celebrate our involvement in Steam's Holiday Sale and Gift Pile Treasure Hunt we're stopping by some of the medium-sized subreddits to run a few giveaways of our games now through December 31st. Of course we love Let's Play videos and totally support anyone who would like to record footage of any of our games for them.

What we'll be giving away, and where you can get it (on the cheap) if you don't win it:

**Steam Titles**

You can grab our deep space strategy title [AI War](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40400) and any/all of its DLC for 75% off through December 31st (even more savings if you go with the Alien Bundle which is everything together.) Not only that but it has a featured achievement Steam users can unlock to earn and win more stuff through the current [The Great Gift Pile treasure hunt event](http://store.steampowered.com/holidaysale) running in conjunction with the huge sale.

Our unique puzzler [Tidalis](http://store.steampowered.com/app/40420/) is 80% off on Steam as well. If you're into deep block-based puzzling (note: not match-3) for $2 instead of $10, make sure to take advantage of the hefty discount.

**Non-Steam Titles**

Our in-development sprawling 2D sidescroller [A Valley Without Wind](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-buy) is available for pre-order now through our site at 50% off the launch price (at the moment it's $10 as opposed to $20.)  You can also grab it on MacGamesStore, Impulse, and GamersGate. Currently in public beta the game is not yet available on Steam, but if/when it does arrive the licence key you'll receive will work to activate the game on Valve's client.


If you'd like to try any of these games you can find the AI War demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/aiwar-downloads), Tidalis demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/tidalis-downloads), and AVWW demo [here](http://www.arcengames.com/w/index.php/avww-downloads). The AI War and Tidalis demos are also available through Steam, though I believe that those are just the PC versions.

How you can participate in the giveaway:


Per request I'll be giving out the keys by asking in the comments for a number between such and such, so I can use a RNG to pick a winner. If the winning number has been selected by more than one person than I'll renumber those who picked right and roll again. If no one picked the number that comes up, I'll find the number closet to--and you can go over (not PiR rules.) The threads are open until I edit the original post saying differently. I'll close them sometime in the next day or so, figure out the winners, and deliver the licence keys to their inboxes.


We'll be adding extra keys to the drawing as we reach various milestones in upvotes, points, and participants to add some incentive for those participating to upvote and get everyone here involved. Basically, as this post accumulates more points and entries, I'll add in extra keys and draw additional winners for them accordingly.


If you do end up picking up [AI War](http://reddit.com/r/aiwar) or [A Valley Without Wind](http://reddit.com/r/avww) during the sale/giveaway, consider checking out their respective subreddits for regular updates and discussion.


Thanks everyone and best of luck! Happy Holidays. :D

Love,

**Edit**: An amendment to the rules above as wisely suggested by Reddit user cyantist. The reasoning is good enough for me:

*I want to encourage you to run the random number generator until you get a hit, rather than find the closest number submission. Shouldn't everyone get an equal chance? If 3 people choose 13, 14, 15 for a chance to win AI War, why then should 14 get a 1/81 chance of winning and 13 and 15 have more than that?*

*Why should people who post later get better chances? (Due to the fact that they can choose numbers relative to those who have already posted.)*",,False,self,t5_2qss1,True,,,True,t3_nl9ht,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/nl9ht/hi_rletsplay_we_arcen_games_are_running_a_few/,

1376430820.0,8,self.letsplay,1kb2n5,3% of views are from subscribers? I'm not sure what we're doing wrong.,sebastiansb,8,0,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1kb2n5/3_of_views_are_from_subscribers_im_not_sure_what/,"I've been trying to figure out what's going on with my channel for a while now and figured I'd ask how things are going with other people's channels.  According to Youtube Analytics 3% of my channel's views come from subscribers.  The tiny size of this figure is admittedly somewhat exaggerated because we have a Saints Row The Third video that is coming up on 300k views, inflating our monthly view count somewhat.  That said, we're projected to reach 1000 subscribers by the end of August and yet our average daily uploads often struggle to break the 20-30 view range.  I'm curious to see what sort of other figures other channels get because this seems strange to me.

http://img823.imageshack.us/img823/1972/klei.png

I accept that only a portion of subscribers watch each video.  This can easily be observed by the fact that Game Grumps and PewDiePie videos rarely get as many views as those channels have subscribers.  I understand that I shouldn't expect every video to reach 1k with our current subscriber count.  My concern comes from the fact that our view counts fall well below estimations I've seen reported in this subreddit and elsewhere.  One of the most common figures I've seen is that videos often get views around 10% of your subscribers count, but in the case of our channel hitting 90 views is an incredibly rare blessing.  Instead we usually get less than a third of that.

What confuses me is that we get several emails per day saying that we have new subscribers coming in.  I could understand if we had a bunch of inactive subscribers that have lost interest and perhaps aren't youtube regulars any more, but when we get dozens of new people in a single week and none of those translate to a increase in audience I'm just sort of baffled.

Grasping at straws, I have a few vague ideas as to why this happens.

1) Perhaps we're only being subscribed to by other let's play channels?  I know it's common practice to spam subscriptions all over the place with the hope that those people will subscribe back.  I believed this more when everyone had usernames, but more recently a lot of subscribers are through people's actual names. Who knows.

2) Is the new YouTube layout killing our channel's exposure to our new audience?  I use this awesome grid layout to keep track of my subscriptions that can be found at https://www.youtube.com/my_subscriptions?feature=mhee but as far as I can tell this link has been removed from the YouTube interface.  I suppose that instead of a functional subscription menu YouTube wants users to stick with the awful facebook-style feed over at https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions or the homepage that buries most of your subscriptions down below the ""recommended for you"" section.

That's all I really have.  Before anyone says ""you shouldn't be doing it for the views"" I want to say that's already the case.  If we weren't doing this for fun we would have quit a long time ago because it's actually a lot of work to put out as much content as we have over the last year and a half.  This is just a nagging issue that we don't understand and is kind of bothering us.  We have a small group of seemingly loyal fans that keep telling us that we deserve more views, which only causes us to question why our views and our supposed audience size are so different from each other.

For starters, this is over a 4-day range, as that's the best data I have so far. It's not big enough to definitively say ""yea verily"" but it's a pretty good approximation. Anyhoo....

My average cost per view (CPV) was $0.02, and I had a total of 3,055 views, for a total cost of $54.68. (I've since been able to get that average CPV down to between 0.01 and 0.014.) With a total of 3,055 views, I've had a net gain of 44 subscribers (52 subs, 8 unsubs), which means that for every 69.75 views, I gained a subscriber. Or, to put it another way, my total cost per new subscriber was $1.395. With a CPV of $0.02, this is too expensive for my blood, but for a CPV of $0.01, I like it as a medium-term strategy for both gaining exposure and new subscribers.

Many of my new subscribers have been leaving comments on videos and engaging in conversation, which is something that's been somewhat lacking on my channel so far (excepting my most popular videos) and shows that they're real people and not just bots. In my eyes, this is a Good Thing, and is one reason why I'm going to switch some of my budget around to spend $5-$10/day on Adwords for the next few weeks, as long as I can keep my CPV down to around 0.01.

Once I find some spare time (ha) I'll be experimenting with different ads and seeing what kind of response and subscriber rate I get if I switch to advertising, say, review videos instead of LPs.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,youtube,True,t3_1jzwhq,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1jzwhq/results_of_adwords_advertising/,

Comment from /u/LolFishFail answered my confusion pretty well.

READ THIS - Judging by this comment section there are a lot of inexperienced people with this matter.

I have had this happen to me. Dispute it. If you have your own commentary over the video, you will be fine.

Say this in the comment box preceding.

""This is a gameplay commentary in the style of a Let's play, the video has my commentary and is covered by fair-use. I give my feedback, criticism and opinion about the game and my experience. All content in this video is either part of the game's assets or royalty free.""

Stating the above paragraph will clear it up. I've had this happen with many of my videos.

If you actually have copyright music / assets in your video, you need to take it down. For example, you thought it would be a good idea to layer some eminem in the background of the video.

I really love doing it and would really like to do both as my job one day because I enjoy it so much. Okay, now that I've introduced myself, let's get to the topic.

It seems like whenever someone mentions on a forum, website, and especially here, that they want to increase views/subscribers/traffic on their channel they are bombarded by comments that say, ""Let's Playing is just for fun. Views don't matter. If you care about views/money then you aren't having enough fun.""

I agree with a few things here. Views should not be your primary focus nor should subscribers or money or anything along those lines. Hell, I've even made a point to cover up my viewer count in Twitch because it makes me not focus enough on the people who are in chat when I'm thinking about how I'm gaining viewers or losing viewers.

BUT I do not believe that wanting more people to see the thing you put insane amounts of work into is wrong. I think it's actually a very good thing. When people say things like ""You obviously aren't having fun and you only care about views and money."" Then it's actually quite discouraging to people who work hard at what they do PLUS it doesn't even answer the damn question.

1374014780.0,10,self.letsplay,1ig2rd,[Update] 21 days later,Byronyk,10,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1ig2rd/update_21_days_later/,"I started my first [**YouTube channel**](http://www.youtube.com/user/TheByronyk) 21 days ago on June 25th. Since then, I have uploaded 59 videos, gained 2000 video views, and 107 subscribers. I wanted to go into brief detail about my first month as an LP commentator, so here it is.

**Setup**
Before I started uploading my first video, I spent a solid week setting up and fine-tuning my recording and editing software. I got my audio and video quality where I wanted it and created a process to produce, edit, and upload videos that worked for me. I use Dxtory for my video and audio recording and use Vegas Pro 12 for video editing and rendering. In the future, I intend on picking up a blue yeti for voice recording as I've heard they produce great quality for the price.

**Commentating/personality**
When I first started out, I considered creating a persona or character to play as but decided it would be much easier to just ... be me. I was nervous at first, but as soon as I realized nobody was watching me, I was able to overcome that nervousness and be myself. 

I feel the main reason people watch LPs is the personality of the commentator. As such, I never allow ""deadair"" into my recordings. I preface each of my LPs with the quick note that I will stop talking (immediately) during dialogue and important moments because I want the players to hear/feel those moments as well.

**Game Choice**
I play games I enjoy playing. I don't record videos of games that are popular or trending unless I am interested in them. For example, at the end of August the new Splinter Cell and Saints Row 4 is coming out -- I intend on playing both. They may be popular/trendy games (at that time), but I love both franchises. Likewise, there are a few indie games coming out that are far less popular that I look forward to playing! Don't cheat yourself -- play what you want!

**Conclusion**
A big reason why I'm loving and enjoying my LPs is /r/Letsplay. You guys are awesome and have given me a ton of information that I've (hopefully) put to good use! I hope to be as helpful to the /r/Letsplay community as you have been now that I have some experience under my belt. I might be doing a 3 month update in the future, but until then, thanks!",,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,youtube,True,t3_1ig2rd,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1ig2rd/update_21_days_later/,

Basically it's just the XCOM logo followed by some clips of what happens in the episode with dramatic music. The idea is to catch the audience's interest while giving the series a bit of a traditional TV-esque consistency.

Now I've been pondering the idea of doing one for every episode from now on, different every time to reflect the events of the episode in question. I enjoyed doing it for this episode and I'm still weirdly proud of it. However I know full well even the most impressive intro can become a tedious pain in the arse, and sometimes you have to ""murder your darlings.""

The aim of the tournament is mainly for all of us to get together and have some fun outside of our let's playing, while still creating some content for us to put on out channels. This can promote new channels, forge some new cross-channel relationships and, most importantly, have some fun!

I have split the team selection into three stages, the first of which where we will be choosing the team leaders for the teams, to lead their Awesomnaut fellows into battle upon the back of a might steed! I will be doing the selection process manually, by trawling through your channels to figure out your personality and general mic quality before deciding on whether or not you are suitable for the role of a leader.

The second phase will consist of the team leaders each choosing a person from this subreddit to be their right-hand LPer, be it through personal sign-up threads, asking on posts or just finding someone on this post right here. You may choose your team-mate however your wish, I will not be restricting your criteria or selection process in any way except for the requirement that it is someone from this subreddit (PM me if you'd like to ask for any special exceptions).

Third, the team leaders will then be able to choose their second teammate, and may choose from either this subreddit or theirs (and their right-hand Awesomenaut's) fanbase to participate in the tourney! Again, your selection process will not be restricted in any way, neither will your criteria.

This post is to gather names for the Team Leaders, all who were on the mailing list will be notified and those who see this are also free to sign up. If you wish to show me some of your content which you feel best represents yourself, include a video link to whichever video you want me to base my selection off of.

Ideally, I am looking for seven team captains (I already lead Team StarStylers) to represent their teams in a bloody and vicious battle to claim the crown, but if the selection pickings are far too slim then four teams overall will be selected to participate. I will also select four backup captains in the instance that a team has to drop out or has an emergency.

Good luck on the submissions, I shall notify those who are selected and post the leaders in the Sign-Up Phase Two post. Happy Nauting!

Edit: We have four potential candidates, three more and then I have to start choosing between which seven of you awesome people get to be team captains.

Edit 2: Woah, that's a few more candidates than I was expecting. Plus I had to sleep, which explains why I'm not back to you quite yet.

I've been working on this particular video for a while. It's a bit of a cop-out, not having any commentary. However, I found it necessary with such a long game. To combat the length, and bore, I've cut out 80% of the fights. I left in a few fights where a character would level, or boss fights.

The youtube description has links to important times in the video, such as getting a star, or arriving at the weapons factory.

I don't expect many people to watch the entire 7 hour video, but I made it because I didn't see anyone else having done it.

A couple closing notes:
I don't know [why this particular boss track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrL0_p_P4HI) sounds wrong in the recording. It sounded just fine during recording.

I have spent (in order)

*-1TB harddrive 90USD

*-logitech webcam 70USD

*-blue snowball 65USD

*-pop filter 15USD

*-23 inch 1080p monitor 180USD

*-3TB external harddrive 120USD


It is a slippery slope lol. I got a 2nd harddrive because one was used for games and one was used for writing. I got a mic/pop filter because my headset quality was not too fantastic. I got a 1080p monitor so I can play at 1080p and have less problems with resolution (eww black bars). I got a 3TB external harddrive because I realize that 1080p made my raws 2x larger and I need storage of my completed works.

I started LPing in late Jan/early Feb. I must've spent 600USD on hardware. 

It is kinda fun LPing with my dog. My dog helps me in not freaking out. I have social anxiety and scared of talking vocally. My dog, Wah Wah, calms me. It is strange, but I pretend that I am talking to her lol.

LPing actually makes me want to go and buy new games. Back then, I was pretty cheap and I usually only buy 1-3 games a year. Now, I buy 1-3 games a month.

How much have you guys spent on hardware to record and do LPs? It seems to be an expensive hobby x_x. It is as expensive as downing 40-100 USD per anime figurine when I was in my phase.

Edit 1: I'm going to bed now. Feel free to leave the rest of your requests, and I'll get to them asap. Some pople have been giving me downvotes for giving them advice, so thanks for that.

Here's some tips to help you whilst I sleep.

* 1. Cutscenes: ALL OR NOTHING. It's frustrating to you read some of the on screen text, then skip through it. Either skip them all, or none at all.

* 2. Game audio normally needs to be a little bit quieter than you. Think of a conversation over dinner. You want to hear the person you're talking to, but background piano is nice. Game is piano, in this situation.

* 3. If you're playing with someone else in the same room, make sure you're an equal distance from the mic. That way the audio is balanced, and if you make changes they will be universal, rather than **HI MY NAME IS 1** ^And ^I'm ^Number ^2

* 4. Just watch your own stuff, that can help a lot.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,1367441233.0,,youtube,True,t3_1dhf3s,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1dhf3s/feedback_thread_d/,

I mean things like naming the video file you are going to upload with keywords. Youtube looks at the title of your video and lpsmrpgep2.mpg doesn't mean much but if you call your video Super Mario RPG Episode 2.mpg YouTube can garner a little bit of info from that and it helps with your search results.

Hello, I'm Chris. I'm an Englishman who enjoys gaming, tea, science and talking to myself. Three of those lead me to start this channel; the tea just keeps me ticking.

My videos are a mixture of gameplay footage and educational discussion, mostly about science and engineering. They're light hearted and hopefully fun to watch, but I thoroughly research my topics to make sure I know what I'm on about!

If you fancy a bit of light relief while still ostensibly furthering your education, please have a look through my videos below and see if anything catches your eye. Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy your time here. Farewell!

**Short Answer Sunday**

- [SAS 1 - Mari0, the original Mario meets Portal!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ny-K9WCxeEo)

Today marks the launch of a new series, wherein each Sunday I take 10 questions submitted by viewers and answer them while playing a new, free game each week. I'm eager to hear what people think of the first episode, and how I can improve the next one. Also, please do leave any questions you have in the comments so I have things to answer next Sunday!

**Bioshock Infinite**

- [P7, Gameplay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY-6mB48nyc) - In which I wipe the Slate clean, and discover how useful Elizabeth can be.

- [P8, Battery Technology](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUGEpeGac-4) - In which I discuss the rather stagnant state of battery technology and its potential future, while being shot at by patriotic robots.

**Black Mesa**

- [Cognitive Bias, Part 9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaO26X7SpiE) - In which I discuss the subconscious mental processes that make us truly terrible at making objective judgments.

- [Gameplay, Part 10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK8z0HajuCo) - In which I am attacked by invisible women, and get bonked on the head by a soldier.

**Farcry 3**

- [P8, The Birth and Death of Stars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzIakt1csmM) - In which I discuss the lifecycle of stars, and get better at driving. Briefly. Very briefly.

How this works is the person below you looks at a considerable number of your videos from beginning to end (for example we'll say 5). When they have finished watching they will make a little report in general terms of:

5 things they liked,
5 things they disliked,
5 things you could improve on etc

when this report is posted and everyone is happy then the person who was in 3rd does the same for the person who was in 2nd. In this way as we work our way down through the list everyone will have to give comprehensive feedback of anothers channel before they themselves get feedback on theirs

I've searched around but got nothing really solid on them owning the song in the credits, so I'd like a bit of help from more experienced Let's players.

Do I dispute this? do i take down the videos(They're still private)? do i mute the videos? i've searched other channels with videos of the ending and apart from the big channels, they all have copyright blurbs next to their description saying it's owned by michael McCaan  and not The Harry Fox Agency.

Update - finally got home after work and class and am able to do something about this, i went to dispute but i'm not really sure to dispute it under fair use, as far as i've gathered The Harry Fox Agency doesn't own the music at all, so just be clear and to make sure i'm not screwing things up, i dispute under fair use and if they reinstate the claim i contact youtube directly right? or do i contact the harry fox agency? it's my first time having to actually do this =/

Update² - Sadly i really have to go to bed as i have work at 9 am and i have to wake at 7 and it's already midnight, I've disputed the claims with fair use (One being from both IDOL and [Merlin] Phonophile actually, same company that content ID'd the other part i talked about) and i'm going to bed, hopefully the matter will be settled when i wake up, wish me luck and i'll update when there's progress =D",,False,self,t5_2qss1,1364267749.0,,youtube,True,t3_1azvqs,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1azvqs/got_my_first_dubious_content_id_claim_today_help/,

This is really disappointing but I've learnt a hard lesson about YouTube today. Little guys get screwed. Little guys get screwed and cannot do anything about it.

So, what happened? After a little slow down on uploads I was super excited to start a Tomb Raider Let's Play and that I did. Only for just a few parts in to get the first 3 parts flagged. Parts 1 and 3 by 'TombRaider' and Part 2 by GoDigital for 'Akaro (Female Vocals)' (I mean WTF?)

I wasn't worried, this has happened before and bear in mind I had NONE of these videos monetised and I've had no issue resolving the problem previously. I filed disputes for each of the claims and explained that I believe the videos to fall under fair use. Which they do.

And today I log in to YouTube ready to see how my latest part is doing only to get a condescenging lesson on copyright from the Happy fucking Tree Friends.. Wait, what!?

Remember the second part claimed by GoDigital for 'Akaro (Female Vocals)' welp that's turned into a full blown COPYRIGHT STRIKE. The absolute nightmare situation for any hopeful Let's Player. At this point, I'd already been limited to 15 minute uploads which for someone who's uploads are mostly (like 90%) all over 15 minutes is pretty debilitating.

Then as you'll see in the screenshot I'm left with a final option of logging a counter-notification claim which can lead to FULL LEGAL ACTION.

I decide what the hell and look at the form. You're only given 2 character limited boxes to explain yourself and the rest of the form is basically where you put in all your information but still know nothing about the company that could potentially sue you. I decide to go ahead with it anyway. The way I see it if I can't upload more than 15 minute videos my channel is finished anyway.

So.. the counter-notification claim is pending. God knows what happens next and the two other disputes are still being processed.

I've since made the entire playlist private and seen that other people have completely deleted their Tomb Raider videos.

I'm mainly making this post to let others know that if you are in the process of disputing a claim just give up now and delete the videos. If you're not partnered or Pewdiepie sized you're essentially screwed.

I don't have much hope for my claim or my channel at this point and it's really disheartening to see that YouTube have such a shitty screening process for copyright claims. Literally anyone can claim copyright on anything and you don't have to prove it unless it gets to court but of course no one wants to go that far out of fear or not wanting to spend money on legal proceedings.

I've been using YouTube for years and love it but this is ridiculous, I just hope this can help others.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,,True,t3_1a48ag,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/1a48ag/copyright_claims_related_to_tomb_raider/,

I've been in a bit of a production slump lately, and I find that the best thing to do when in this situation is find things that I can work on to better my channel. Right now I feel like my tagging is adequate, but if anyone has any advice as to how I can tag better I would very much appreciate it. At the moment I basically use tags like ""X walkthrough"" ""X Playthrough"" and so forth along with all the common lets play tags. However, once I run out of ideas with that regard I usually use high volume tags like ""gaming"" ""Building games"" and so forth. I know people are generally guarded about their SEO but I could really use help in this arena.

I was just wondering, whether anyone'd be interested in watching an LP of the first S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game.

I feel like the era of frustrated LPers being funny is either over, or there is currently nobody that can *really* pull it off. Game Grumps got away with it for a bit, but now it's grating and not fun to watch. And when you're just starting out, there isn't much chance (unfortunately) for people to be watching you just for your personality. Chances are you're still finding your feet and your style, so likelihood is, the viewer is here for the game. 

So how do *you* get around this? I'm not a blind LPer, I like to play a game with some knoweledge, so I have more to talk about, give the viewer some insight (Which is my advice for the thread by the way; **if you struggle to have something to talk about, atleast know about the game, so you can provide insight and a fresh point of view**). But If you are a blind LPer, how do you stop yourself getting stuck? That one puzzle that baffles you and you have to think too hard to talk at the same time?

Basically this is the Super Nintendo version and when I was but a lad this game had me utterly entranced with its amazing gameplay, music, and visuals. I play it once a year usually and this time I'm making it a series! I worked really hard on the quality of this particular series. I looked around for other SM playthroughs and every one I saw had horrible flickering and Samus fading in and out of existence. I've fixed all those problems!

I'm thinking about how much I like this game and it's reminding me how much I appreciate all of you who tune in, comment, and all that jazz. You guys keep me going and I truly appreciate it! Thanks!

So I've wanted to make Let's Plays for a while now and have finally gotten the means to do so. I picked FTL as my first game because 1.) It's awesome and 2.) It is one of the few Steam games I have that doesn't take 20+ hours to beat that I am actually decent at.

As this is my first LP, I know I have lots of room for improvement. Some things I noticed is the game volume seems a bit to loud and my voice is kind of monotonous. As far as volume goes, that is easily fixable. As far as my voice, well... That's just my natural way of speaking so that will take some more effort. Also I didn't really explain how the game works, which I didn't even notice as I was recording. Do you think that this is something that is necessary in a Let's Play? And would doing it in video 2 or 3 be to late to explain the game mechanics?

So I've wanted to a Mirror's Edge a while ago but I wasn't sure how to present it. Definitely not going to just talk about what I'm doing constantly because something is always happening. Definitely not going to do it as a speed run either.

So I decide it to play the game like you are watching from Faith's eyes as she is going through the level for the first time.  With the occasionally bit of commentary to highlight a little something here and there.

Maybe it works.  Maybe it doesn't.  I'd like your opinion either way. Also, the first video isn't really an episode of the LP.  It is a video explaining my LP goals and a quick tutorial of the basics of the game.  I'd skip it if you played Mirror's Edge before and just read what I wrote.

Many playlists inside.,Bortobob,10,3,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/167gxm/first_real_time_posting_my_content_to_this/,"Hello! Not sure if many/any readers will remember; Earlier I posted my story about how I [got into doing LP's.](http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/152dim/my_lp_story_how_i_started_and_where_i_am_now/) Now, I'm posting the links to the various playlists of my LP's. Any, and all, criticism is welcome! I'm just happy to finally feel ready to put my work out there in a big way.

My first playlist is the one I probably was most nostalgic about. Me and a friend complete [Donkey Kong Country 2 - Episode 1 - 8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhIQLDkKWQo&amp;list=PLPXR890r2OKmdhqOu0DXk6OuAXF1vC5Jp&amp;index=1) to 100%. He's relatively bad at video games, and my logic behind having him play with me was that I could explain and show things about this and other games to him, and by extension, to the audience, fluidly. It just feels more natural to present stuff to someone next to you. For better or worse... (I can get a little offensive in the name of comedy.)

Second, I had my brother join me in trying to puzzle out [Perspective - Episode 1 &amp; 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mjD-Qv8Y_o&amp;list=PLPXR890r2OKnT73iWbAKkrLoiwvxRAIsf&amp;index=1) shortly after it was released. I've ALWAYS been attracted to abstract problem solving. And who hasn't imagined jumping their car or action hero across your home landscape from your armchair. Or pinching someone's head with your fingers from a distance. This game seemed to play off those concepts, so it piqued my interest.

Third, my brother thought I'd enjoy the Japanese puzzle game [Catherine - Episode 1 - 9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u78IDcuv1qc&amp;list=PLPXR890r2OKmS8D0vsKWdbgjsnjbtSB8d&amp;index=1) And he was right! Though, I personally skip the story involved in that game, because though it is pretty well fleshed out, it seems tacked on to a game about pushing and pulling blocks.

Fourth, and probably one of my most favorite games to play, ever, is [Banjo Kazooie - Episode 1 - 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0m5VyQNGcA&amp;list=PLPXR890r2OKmdTbnGCOwaio_XEnf5ULxW&amp;index=1) I'm taking my time with this game. It's a work in progress, and I plan to 100% the entire series, Banjo Tooie included.

Fifth, more of a one-off, but still an old favorite, [Super Monkey Ball Deluxe - Episode 1 - 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-kEfkAnJmU&amp;list=PLPXR890r2OKkexldK6_KTN96GK0fP9YJ1&amp;index=1) I did play the non deluxe Super Monkey Ball version, but for the sake of recording, I went with the deluxe version, so as to make it easier for my inexperienced friend to advance through the different levels.

Sixth, and finally, another in progress game; [Super Mario World - Episode 1 -3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgt4kW7veeA&amp;list=PLPXR890r2OKl22x3Kxdc9AYZvJ6wpiYzG&amp;index=1) on the Super Nintendo. This was one of those games I played the crap out of as a youngin'. The banter isn't ^quite up to par... But I don't care, because this game is just fun to try to remember all the secrets, which we regularly do in this playlist.

It wasn't the audio, what I got was ""Visual content administered by BMVEntertainment"". Thinking, what on earth do they have to connect them to Scribblenauts Unlimited? I googled them and it turns out nothing. They pull this shit a lot, more often on Minecraft videos which are very demonstrably false. But unfortunately this isn't MC so I don't have a big obvious public statement from the devs saying ""Yeah, we love videos of our game, go make what you want"".

So what's the course of action here? Can I just put in a fair use dispute and they'll back down instantly?

Anyway,for someone like myself, posting videos daily is not something I can do. I'm always busy, but there are some times where I can record and when I can upload. However, those moments are few and far between. 

To fix this, I use the ""Scheduled"" feature in uploading my Youtube videos, allowing me to have certain videos publish when I want them to. This keeps a nice flow of videos, and allows me to watch it over and make sure everything is fine before launch. 

Additionally, I also maintain a blog ([www.JeromeTheGiant.TK](http://WWW.JeromeTheGiant.TK)) where all my posts are scheduled as well, and any videos that are scheduled on Youtube are timed to have a blog post to go off at the same time it is made public. Doing all of this in one day allws me to have content flow bit by bit, rather than post a shitload of content and hoping someone looks at it.

To the point. Lately I've been seeing a lot of Minecraft posts on r/Letsplay and over the past few days, I've had the same question screaming at me.

""Should Minecraft LP's even be allowed on r/Letsplay""

Before anybody flips out, I don't have a problem with people that do Minecraft LP's. Hell, I have one myself (well I abandoned it) but let me ask you this:

""Do you watch them, or even offer feedback when you see a Minecraft post?""

I used to. Sometimes. But now, I just can't. Minecraft is just one of those games where you can't really say a lot about. Usually I find myself telling people the same thing: ""Perhaps your video quality could be better and your audio levels could be more balanced"" and all that jazz. Sometimes (this is going to sound harsh) I just think people post Minecraft videos for the sake of views. Yeah, they say they want ""advice"" but isn't that the codeword for ""Views""?

So how come this doesn't apply to other LP's people have posted? Well it's simple. Minecraft has been butchered to death. To the point where Minecraft LP's (from small youtubers) don't get any views. Think of it like this. Why should I watch your LP, when there are other and much better Minecraft videos like BlueXephos. Again, I'm trying my hardest to not sound like a dick. But this is the only way I can come out and talk about it.

Before I end with one last question, I'd like to point out there are other reddits out there for Minecraft LP's.
Here are the following subreddits that relate to Minecraft LP's:

MinecraftLP: http://www.reddit.com/r/MinecraftLP

I remember first coming across this subreddit. I was, for a lack of better words, nervous. Nervous that people wouldn't like me, or that they wouldn't approve of my videos or just tell me I'm stupid for joining r/letsplay.
For about a month or two, I was a simple dweller. Never showing my content. Only looking at other peoples videos and saying to myself ""I know how I can help this guy!"" but never actually making a post. It was until I eventually got the courage to ask people for advice. The feedback I got was outstanding. Immediately I was given a warm welcome and I was given the feedback I required. Harsh or not, feedback is feedback and I learned from it!

Once I focused a lot more on improving my videos, I eventually spent *most* of my earnings on a new microphone. Getting a new microphone was the first stepping stone for me. It showed how serious  I am towards LP'ing, even If I do suck. My memory is a little blurry after this. I remember making a few threads about microphone and video quality and that's about it. I then went on to contributing to the community by giving out tips/advice when people asked for it. I also improved on other things such as my commentary. I won't toot my own horn but I consider my commentary to be a hell of a lot better than the commentary I had on my previous videos.

My point is. I would have NEVER been able to improve if it weren't for you guys. You helped me get through dark times and more. You opened my eyes.

In order to pull myself out of a depression that held me in its clutches for several long (LONG) months, I decided to reorder my entire life. I'm switching Universities and moving to the Canadian Haven: Toronto to study TV/Radio Broadcasting. This came around the same time that my friend, Wade, suggested that we start a youtube channel.
Eager to work on my editing portfolio and excited to share our strange, dry sarcasm and bitterness with the world, I accepted.

It would make me super excited if you decided to check us out. Right now, we're playing Minecraft maps, and I've been working through Black Mesa. Wade's looking into Splunkey, and we're thinking about Magicka.

Thanks for reading!

I noticed how a lot of people are asking for feedback (Including myself) but not a lot of people offer feedback to begin with. With that in mind I decided to help some people out by sharing my opinion towards their videos. This way maybe I'll find someone that I enjoy watching and maybe you'll also get a new subscriber here and there on top of that.

I will try to do this once per week if I can keep up. Like I said in the title, I will help out the first 10 people that will request feedback in the comment section. Please don't request any feedback if you noticed that 10 people already posted before you, I will not reply back. Best thing to do is just wait until next week.

Alright so leave a comment with your channel and a short description about your goal and how you started then add one of your videos and I'll reply as soon as I check it out. Keep in mind that I will give feedback as a random viewer that just found one of your videos randomly. As long as you can take criticism in a mannered way and use it to help you out in the end, everything should be fine.


EDIT: Just wanted to let you know that for some reason a lot of comments (including mines) have disappeared so I can't check some of them. Hopefully it will get fixed soon. I'll check out the ones that I can see. Cheers!

EDIT 2: Problem got fixed, I can see all the comments properly now. I'll offer more feedback whenever I have time for it. I'll try to check all the people in the end.

What do people think of having the face cam in non-scary games? 

I know the typical first reaction is that they are pointless and bad and omg why would you do that. Is that really the case, though? I mean sure they probably don't add much to the gameplay, but I feel like it could add to other areas.

For example, I have a bad habit of spending a long time explaining stuff while basically doing nothing in game. Having the ability to be expressive on webcam could give the viewer something to focus on while nothing interesting is happening in game. 

I also feel like having the face there could probably get the viewer to relate to the LPer a little bit more. And really that's what it's all about. A good LP is about a likable character behind it. Maybe it's easier to connect to a face than a voice?

Just some thoughts really. Personally it seems like I'm just perfectly straight faced even when my heart is racing and I'm scared out of my wits, so it probably wouldn't add anything to my own videos.",,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,youtube,True,t3_yni3i,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/yni3i/face_cam/,

I hadn't been happy in a long time because I was putting the image of a responsible father and husband first. I gave up most of the things I enjoyed and it backfired with misery. After the split I tried looking back at the things I wanted to do before and the things that had made me happy- a back to basics strategy. I returned to gaming a little bit each day, being a single father meant no marathons. I decided to turn it into a social thing after watching Shepard's Monster Hunter videos and seeing the community response. I chose Dragon Quest and dove right in.

The experience was enjoyable and the LP community is largely positive and helpful and I've met a lot of people with similar tastes in gaming. Somewhere along the line I applied for an AdSense account after seeing many popular LPers like HCBailey and Kenshin were also running ads. I also familiarized myself with ""Fair Use"" as it pertains to copyright laws.

For a while nothing changed, I had a small list of subscribers (around 50) and only saw a handful of views each day. On August 7th I got my import copy of Dragon Quest X and started my LP on it, my channel exploded from 10 views a day to over 1,000. My AdSense account started inflating thanks to all the additional views I was getting.

I could see a future really getting into Gaming Culture, becoming part of it, and making it my living. I put a plan into place of the high profile games coming out that I was going to play anyways. I had a real chance at making actual money off of doing something I love, and an escape from my job (which is actually a really good job but not what I want).

This morning I was greeted with an email from Google notifying me my account has been disabled. Here is the portion of the email which does not directly include account information.

""With our advertising programs, we strive to create an online ecosystem that benefits publishers, advertisers and users. For this reason, we sometimes have to take action against accounts that demonstrate behavior toward users or advertisers that may negatively impact how the ecosystem is perceived.

I've gone to the forums for help, the spike in my viewership could easily flag their systems to believe me to be botting for inflated views. I provided my charts and numbers, the matching increased comment activity, everything I can. But now all I can do is wait and the outlook isn't good. The users on the forums rarely see appeals against an account being disabled being successful.

I have to ask at this point; learning how YouTube practices the handling of its partners and producers, are they really the best place for the LP community?",,False,self,t5_2qss1,False,,youtube,True,t3_ylrnl,http://www.reddit.com/r/letsplay/comments/ylrnl/is_youtube_really_the_best_way_to_go/,

* If you record then split into parts and you do live commentary, how do you work that? Do you keep an eye on the time, and start/stop commentary accordingly? Or is it just easier to do post-commentary if you're recording that way?

* What kind of info do you like to give about a game in the very beginning of a LP?

* If I do live commentary: is it better to record audio in FRAPS at the same time as the video, or use FRAPS for video only and a program like Audacity for audio simultaneously?

It is cool to find this reddit and I will take some time to also check out other creator's content and give feedback as much as I can. Feel free to let me know if I need to change anything in the comments here and I will ensure I take all feedback on board. 

Many thanks to you all!

Hello Reddit, my name is RamblingJosh and I Let's Play stuff (dhurr). I've been doing so for a while now and just started actively using Reddit, so yea...    
  
Currently I am working on two games:  
Arc the Lad II ([playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA96543E5E89724CA&amp;feature=view_all))  
Quest 64 ([playlist](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4150AE410F0FD91A&amp;feature=view_all))
  
I tend to focus almost exclusively on older games, usually RPGs, and typically games that I feel were under appreciated, lesser known etc. I update the ""main"" series (currently Arc the Lad II) daily unless some issue arises.  
  
In the past I have done a ""when I can"" side project (usually meaning every other day) but after Quest 64 I'm probably going to stick to one game at a time. I'm going to school currently to study game design, so my time isn't what it once was.  
  
Anyways I hope you enjoy, and here's my previous work. I welcome any and all comments/criticism as well.

Networking means that you do dual letsplays or dualcoms, right?

If you know exactly what networking means and how to do it successfully tell it here. This will also help any other channels reading this post. Win win. 

Also instead of posting your videos on forums, He recommended networking.

Currently I just use the microphone on my cheap plantronics gaming headset and then run it through a noise reduction filter in audacity.

I'm in the market for a good microphone roughly in the £50 area has anyone got a microphone in mind that provides high quality input? I would prefer one with a mute switch too if possible for casting.

Also on the subject of pop filters do any of you use them? I've read that a nylon tights stretched over a coat hanger is just as good as buying a professional one. Thoughts?

While we're on the subject what stores/websites do you often buy your hardware from?

I'll leave links to the specific playlists at the bottom of this post and please comment, share feedback and discuss anything you want!

So, this week has seen many new episodes to Saints Row The Third which I have been doing with a friend on Skype. Metal Gear Solid 2 HD has had a few updates but I do intend on finishing this before Mass Effect 3. Dark Souls has been left for abit because i'm actually stuck and I am trying to move on from this same bit i've been at for awhile.

* If you want feedback, post a (recent) video of yours. You can use the template of ""[Game Name] - [Channel Name]"", but as long as it's easy to tell what game it is, and who you are, it's all good.  

* If you post for feedback, **you should give feedback as well**. Just because you want help doesn't mean you can't also give it!

* **Constructive criticism only please**. Being critical is fine as long as you're doing it politely.

He really shows off the true potential of the game, as well as it's flaws. He's got a great voice and narration style, and it's just a really well done LP. He's doing [an LP of Crimson Skies](http://bd.baldurk.org/lp/65) at the moment that's certainly well worth checking out.

The next that comes to mind is [the legendary Dwarf Fortress LP, Boatmurdered](http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/Boatmurdered/). The game has come a long way since then, and there have been several other excellent LPs, but this sticks in my mind as one of the first LPs I've read, and one of the best. It takes some time to get going, but it has some amazing moments.

One that shows the potential to tell a completely different story is [The Terrible Secret of Animal Crossing](http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/Animal Crossing/). Animal Crossing as a horror story? Yes please.

[Oyster's Megaman LPs](http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/index.php?sauth=Oyster&amp;search=1) are also great. They start out fairly normal...then he starts taking challenges from the audience. Then it gets very interesting.

[Chip Cheezum and General Ironicus' Metal Gear Solid LPs](http://lparchive.org/LetsPlay/index.php?sauth=Chip Cheezum, General Ironicus&amp;search=1) are both entertaining and show off a ton of content. Great stuff, what an LP really should be like.

One of the most important things that I see when I open up a new channel is the name of the titles. Inconsistant episode names are an absolute no-go in my opinion. Titles like ""lp minecraft 1 my first house"" and below is another video titled ""we can do this gta lp""

Titles are so important and so many people forget about them.

What are some of your absolute no-go's?

EDIT: Here are some of the things people dislike about videos - maybe it can help someone

Keep in mind, those are for the most part just suggestions that CAN help in theory

* ""funny"" voices
* intro video/picture (if you make one, make it no longer than 2-3 seconds)
* wrong/uninformative/""ugly"" titles/thumbnails
* ""forced"" acting (acting itself can be okay, just don't overdo it and don't simply try to be someone else)
* no ""substance"" behind your video / no effort / no goal
* facecam/scarecam can work - some people seem to hate it others enjoy it

As you read in the title, believe it or not I started a YouTube channel as a new years resolution at the start of this year. I wasn't working at the time and wanted to learn a new skill with my newfound free time. I started off by making a marathon mode let's play on Civilization V, which over time has actually become pretty popular (first video now has over 2000 views)!

Now I'm not saying by any means that I am making it big on YouTube yet, but since January 1st I now have 15,361 views and 224 subscribers and I am really pleased with myself not only for that amount of people enjoying my content, but also for actually sticking with doing something properly!

I try to release a video every single day. Due to editing, real life commitments etc. I don't always manage a video every day but I do my best to make it there! To be honest with you guys I'm just making the videos because It's teaching me skills in video editing, production, voice acting and believe it or not, self confidence!

I hope you enjoyed this post, It isn't really promoting anything or making a serious point. I just wanted to share two things I strongly feel about doing these videos.

1. If you truly love what you do, whatever that may be, do it. You won't necessarily be successful at it but do it anyway, for you. If you don't try you'll never know!

2. When you don't have a job, practice doing something new, you'll feel really good for doing it inside which helps you put a positive spin on life! And those one or two comments from people saying they love your content? Really puts a smile on your face.

I am, as so many others, a Youtuber who posts Minecraft videos. I do have a few other videos, but I focus on the wonderful blocky game.

Not too long ago, I LOST INTEREST in recording a video, rendering it, uploading it to Youtube and being done. I felt like there wasn't much sense to it.

So I decided to start a new world (utilizing the ""UHC mode"" = no natural health regeneration) in which I would play for myself, build good looking &amp; technical things and most importantly: HAVE FUN playing.

Every week or every two weeks I take all the recorded footage, edit it nicely and select the most important parts of the recording, cut the less interesting things out (you won't see me punching trees for 3 minutes ;) )

I also add some post commentary parts to lead the viewer through the video, through the adventure, to make somewhat of a ""STORYLINE"".

Since MUSIC IS VERY IMPORTANT for video (and in general) in my opinion, I spent quite some time looking for good music that I could use in the videos.

And here is the result; THE FIRST EPISODE:
http://youtu.be/L24bLeRHT8w


I enjoy these kind of Let's Plays myself, Queenkinghappy or Red3yz are more popular Youtubers that go for a similar style.

I like relaxed videos. Does that lead to a LACK OF ENTHUSIASM &amp; makes the video less interesting? Tell me your opinion!

(Also, as you can tell from the video, english is not my mother tongue. I like to talk in english, though, and hope that this is not an issue.)

When I was done editing the first episode, I rewatched it more than once, and I enjoyed it. This is how it should be. Do you enjoy it, though? BE HONEST!

___


TL/DR:

Lost interest in producing ""ordinary"" MC Let's Play.
Started new world &amp; series which is more heavily edited, only a video every 1-2 weeks, good music, a bit of a ""storyline"", trying to go for relaxed videos.
Do you like it?

*Highest Comment Score*: Last week 2 comments tied for highest comment score. 

1. This one comes from /u/Spatula_Hat ""If you're about to say something but get interrupted by an npc talking or a cutscene, say it anyway. You can always move the audio to a section were its okay to speak.""

2. The other top placed comment was from /u/shdwj ""I learned the importance of recording and editing multiple episodes at a time to keep yourself from staying behind on your upload schedule. :D Simple, but true!"" 

*Personal Choice from Jon*: I couldn't choose between 2 of them so I split them into 2 categories.

1. Ideology: This idea came from the mind of /u/rogueportjack. ""I learned that you always have less time than you think you do, and you should always, always ALWAYS always make sure you're recording from the correct mic.""

For this series, I didn't do any autoducking through Audacity since I had already spent a couple days playing, editing and exporting. I'm going to experiment with it in the future, though, and see how it compares to just lowering the game volume and boosting my vocal audio channel.

Some of the games that I'll be covering on the 3DS as they launch will include Mario &amp; Luigi Dream Team, TLoZ: A Link Between Worlds and perhaps even one of the new Pokemon games in the fall (I've never played Pokemon before, so that should be interesting).

Any comments or suggestions for improving the look/sound/etc of the 3DS videos, as well as my videos in general, would be greatly appreciated.

The format is basically we are playing something relatively ""non-thinking"" like Torchlight 2, Killing Floor, Magicka, (or we can not play anything at all depending on your preference), and while we are playing I just ask you questions like ""what got you into LPing?"", ""inspriations?"", ""favorite big time youtubers?""

I'm still ironing out the list of interview questions but I'm just wondering who would be interested?

*edit* So i have about 11 questions/topics written up right now.
I'm thinking of just have one guest at a time to start off with and depending on how that goes, maybe expand to 2 guests.
NB - Also, for those of you guys who don't have your channels set up as your flairs, please set them up or send me a Youtube PM! (This is just so I can contact you outside of reddit, if/when I invite you on the show!)

Thanks for the great feedback everyone!

Don't have much experience, but one thing I did learn is that you should never put expectations on yourself. That is what dooms you to fail. Whether you are first starting out (I have to be FUNNY, WITTY, INFORMATIVE, etc) Fuck that shit. Just do your own thing. If they like it they like it. If they don't. Then now you know.
When you start out at anything. You will most likely not be very good. So take the constructive (or not constructive) criticism for what it is. Don't beat yourself up, or defeat yourself. As if you can't do it. Just learn from mistake and move on to becoming a better LPer

Same thing applies if you already posted/uploaded videos and they liked it. Don't put expectations on yourself (They liked me when I was FUNNY, WITTY HERE, ACTED LIKE THIS, SAID THAT, etc). None of that shit matters now. It's a new video. Just play the game.  Clear your mind, and go with the gameplay. If they liked you before. Just be how you are (however you are).

This is just a bit of info that I am learning from my very limited time of LPing.

TL;DR: The more expectations you put on yourself. The more likely you are doomed to lose yourself.

I have some ideas for features (if this idea ever comes to fruition that is) so hear me out:
***
- **The daily top 5 videos** 

yesterday's top 5 videos on the subreddit are posted to the channel individually, the videos would be determined by a panel of judges and the creator would be notified by the judges that his or her video was picked, the user can then opt in or out to this as they see fit and will not damage their connection with the channel.

***
- **Exclusive content** 

the channel will hold the right to commission exclusive content from users, this means organizers can request you do a video for the channel, there will be no time constraints on this and users may refuse the request anytime, additionally the channel will be open to submission of unique material from users via drop box or some other application and will be reviewed by the previously mentioned panel of judges.
***
- **Play Dates**

Personally I am excited about this prospect, on the subreddit users and organizers can devise play dates for those on the subreddit, the process of organizing these play dates will involve: 

1. The time, date, ect.

2. The game and what platform

2. Who will and who will not be recording

3. [OPTIONAL] if there are too many to fit into one game, organizers will divide users into groups, individual groups will play their own individual game, for example: (TF2) group A will be playing TDM while group B will be playing man vs machine and so on.

4. After the play date those who were recording will upload their footage to drop box, and an editor will then string together a highlight video of the matches played much like what rooster teeth do with their let's plays. Those who record will be credited and referenced in the description and their footage will be annotated with a link to their video.

This is an awkward thing to talk about but my idea for this is that each user will get 75% of the revenue of each video they make, the 25% will be put into a pool of money and then divided up and given to all users involved at the end of the week, this means users will adleast get a bit of money even if they do poorly in terms of views, but, this is not an incentive to post bad quality content, if the user submits videos with dislikes dominating above 60% of the video 3 times in a row then they will be flagged and intervened and taken off the payroll, they will still get their share of money for that week, but next week they will be reverted back to square one.
***
- **Partnerships**

Technically speaking anyone who gets their video onto the channel is a partner, and anyone is eligible to joining regardless of how many subscribers of views their channel gets, the channel is not about money, or spinning a profit, it is about helping users find their audience and getting some exposure, that is the main aim of this channel.

***

- **Judges**

There will be 5 judges, the reason five is because its an odd number and  therefore there will be no ties for votes, the judges duty is to review videos submitted to see if it is quality enough entertainment, each judge will vote yes or no on a video and this will decide if the video is worth uploading, but the majority vote takes the cake so remember 3 no's and 2 yeses does not mean yes.

Also to avoid bias and strain on the judges, the judges will be rotated for each day, switching the roster of judges every week.

To become a judge people merely need to opt in and they will be fed videos when its their turn.

I am kind of conflicted on what to do during cutscenes, particularly long cutscenes that lasts more than a few minutes. Do you:

1) Shut up and say nothing during the cutscenes? Although, that is a lot of ""dead space"". You could talk about it after the cutscene, but still.. that is a lot of emptiness.

2) Do you make ""small talk"" or respond to the cut scene? 
Ex: 
Woman - ""I am sorry about everything. It is all my fault."" 
Me -""We can make up. Kissy Kissy.""
Less intrusive to the cutscene. Does not provide or enhance the story/game. Just trying to be funny or reactive.

3) Do you try to make sense of the cutscene and reiterate what an NPC says?
Ex:
NPC - ""Okay, we are going to a mining ship to investigate what is going on.""
Me - ""I think everyone is all dead on that ship and most of our current party is going to die like red shirts""
Although, this is a bit intrusive, especially if there is not much space inbetween each line. It is also a problem trying to squeeze it inbetween lines because while you are talking about the last line... another NPC or character would start talking. You can end up talking over the next line.

[Episode 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaijYwgbYBc)- Am I as scared as when I started RE2? More importantly- can I get the controls right this time?

[Episode 2]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=webZOSJ1bZU)- attacked by plenty of villagers and the scary chainsaw guy. Very traumatising.

[Episode 3]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQm-4pcpiRE)- We make ‘Leon sandwiches’!

[Episode 4]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3dREuwy3g0)- We meet the merchant for the first time before I get ambushed once again.

[Episode 5]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt83BSE7msY)- ‘The Trouble with Lagging’ special!

[Episode 6]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHmXT59nmT0)- Chainsaw man comes after me again, and I’m still just as traumatised as the first time round.

[Episode 7]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHmXT59nmT0)- We head off into the cemetery...

[Episode 8]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X2kQREbSmc)- I explain what I had to sacrifice in order to stop the emulator lagging...

[Episode 9](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf_qrTIFdvU)- We face-off with Del Lago, the annoying fish.

I hope you enjoy the episodes as much as I enjoyed recording them. If you want to see more then feel free to subscribe to my Youtube, Facebook and Twitter channels. I regularly post Let’s Play’s on Youtube, including a completed Let’s Play of RE2!

Well, that never came off, but it did get me thinking. Someone, I don't remember who, brought up the idea of maybe live-streaming it at one point, and I thought that was a bloody good idea. That leads me onto this idea I have.

Pretty straight forward- I have a Twitch account and I am proposing the idea of doing a big stream, featuring as many of us at any one time as possible. Sort of make a day of it, and people can come and go as they please. If you're not available to do it at one point in the day, it's okay- the stream will most likely still be running later on for you to jump in on.

Games would ideally be stuff we can all go multiplayer on, stuff like TF2, Garry's Mod, Left 4 Dead 2 and others. Over that, we'd be on Skype chatting over it.

To get people over there watching, we could schedule a date and then we all promote the fact to our viewers/subscribers that we're gonna be on the stream. If everyone intent on being there does that, with any luck they might go 'oh, HE's there? I'll tag along and watch for him'. Of course then, people won't just be seeing you, they'll be seeing other Let's Players that they might find entertaining. That AND we'll all get to work with each other on something that we can look back on. 

I'd be looking to do it fairly soon. Not sure what the response you'll all have will be, but the idea's there and up for expansion. If you wanna discuss further or you're sold already PM me your Skype name and I'll add you.

I've been getting prepared in the past few weeks to start an LP channel, and had a few questions and concerns that I didn't see addressed in the Wiki. If you'd be so fantastically wonderful as to answer them, it'd be greatly appreciated!

**AUDIO**

* I have an M-Audio Producer USB mic with no pop filter. Will I need one for this mic, and where can I get one?

* I will be using [""Action!""](http://mirillis.com/en/products/action.html) for screen capturing. Is the audio on here good enough, or should I use Audacity and put the two together in editing?

**VIDEO** 

* As I mentioned earlier, I'll be using Action! for my screen capture software. Is there anything I should know about it in particular (such as quirks about it, unique features, etc.)

* Do you typically use a facecam when recording? Why/why not? I'm comfortable with using a facecam, though I don't know if it's a good idea or not for a new channel. ***Note: I won't be doing it right off the bat; I'm wondering if it's worth it to purchase a webcam.***

**EDITING**

* I'll be using Premiere Pro CS5 to edit my videos. I don't have experience with it (I'll be using my father's copy that he already owns), but I've watched a few YouTube tutorials on it. How easy/difficult is it to grasp?

**GENERAL QUESTIONS**

* What are some ways that I can improve the quality of my videos quickly? I realize that I'm not going to immediately be as talented as some bigger names (i.e. PewdiePie or Syndicate), but I'm a quick learner and adapter.

* What are some good ways to increase my audience? I don't want to pull an ""IcyXlau"" (there was a bit of... let's call it ""controversy""... surrounding him as there were hundreds of spam Happy Wheels levels and YouTube comments promoting him), but at the same time I'd like to find a way to grow.

* Is it worth trying to get partnered with a network (i.e. Machinima)? What effects does this have on viewers/subs? 

* Related to the last question: What would be a good network to try to get partnered with (once possible)?

They notify you of every single indie bundles, steam/GOG/Green Man Gaming/Desura/Origin/Gamefly sales, and even rebates that make your entire purchase free.

I figure the help to the LP community is two-folds: First, it gets you cheaper games for LPing, and second, more importantly, you'll see which games are on sale, and thus, more people will be looking up videos for. If you can't decide on the next LP, you can always just look for a new bundle, buy it for a dollar, LP the game thats most interesting/have least information about for a spike of views.

This was held up in review for a day or so, and then was denied. I could appeal it, but if they decide I'm wrong I don't wanna chance my channel getting taken down. All for the $0.01 I've made so far. 

I do indeed own or have rights to everything in my videos, aside from the game footage itself. My music and art have been kindly handcrafted by some talented friends.

I was also under the impression that if you're using the footage for commentary/review/education/etc purposes, it's fair game. 

Does it all depend on the game's developer/publisher? Is it just luck of the draw? Does anyone else have experience with this?
