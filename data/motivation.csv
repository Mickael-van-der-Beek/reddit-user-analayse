Sitting on the shitter.  And I realized.  Shit.  I've been done with my business for sometime now.  I'm just too gangster to get up.  And then you realize you had to add that last part to your message to your buddy describing the event because you forgot the hilarious thing you were actually gonna say.  Even though the gangster line you had to add actually did happen.  And you have to clarify just to make sure he doesn't think you're lying because you aren't.  Damn it feels good to be a gangster.  My thumbs are moving so fucking fast I never even want to stop texting, I just want to keep watching them and watching them as they jump from place to place at seemingly random urges when in fact highly sophisticated neural messages are traveling form the brain to the hands as the words are thought.  In real time.  As they are fucking created within the meat inside the skull.  Shit moves that quickly.  That fast.  People don't believe when they wake up in the morning that they really can do anything they set their minds to .  Fuck them.  Because look at this.  These things you see.  These characters strung together are literally created in halves of milliseconds before the correct symbols are mashed by the thumbs.  Humans love superheroes but no one, fucking nobody, wraps their mind around the fact that we are all superheroes, we hold a lump of meat within a hard shell that can create.  Create works of art, songs, weapons of mass destruction.  All that holds us back is the innate human desire not to believe.  To not believe in God, in peace, in war, in themselves.  The abstract mind is the greatest superpower ever possible.  And we all have it.  But we don't all use it.""",,False,,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,t3_1968is,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1968is/my_friend_drunk_texted_me_one_of_the_most/,

I meditated to a [YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBVi2TCHb64&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) of some soft, spiritual music. While I meditated, I imagined myself having a good day at work. At tackling every task with fervor and the intention to do it right. To pay attention to detail. I then listened to the motivational [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1kzMfRJGhE&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) on YouTube somewhere in this sub about putting in effort every single fucking day for everything that you do. Then I imagined going back to the gym and giving it a 110 percent. And to eat right: fish, chicken, rice, protein shakes. I imagined how awesome it would be to get all these things done, today, no excuses, no bullshit. And I had an awesome day. I did everything I mentioned. Hell, I even flossed. 

It wasn't easy for me. Usually wake up staring at the ceiling imagining how awful and boring my life is. It's been a struggle to take a shower and get ready for work. But today, it was different. I set out to do something and did it. I did it. And now I can't wait to continue this tomorrow. Just wanted to share this. Keep at it, everyone. Be your best.

If I want the best, I've got to be the best.

I've started looking after my appearance, getting fit, losing weight, doing extra activities I wouldn't normally do and trying harder at work.  All from being dumped, at one stage I didn't think I'd ever care but for some reason I've managed to use this to my advantage (finally)

My biggest motivation in the gym is when I get tired I just think of a big Fuck You to the person who dumped me and I really get moving again.

Seeing some of these posts has helped me realise that I'm the only one that will make things change.

basically, as long as i can remember i have had an issue that i like to refer to as a 'failure to execute'.

This basically means that, whilst i do ALOT of thinking (including thinking about actions that must be taken) i do almost zero acting. I cant explain it and i know the easy answer for someone on the outside is to tell me to ""just do it"", but it's like i wont respond.

I just feel like i'm pumping myself up for the moment of necessary action - say, an essay/letter i need to write, or a job that needs to be done - then the moment comes, and i just, watch it pass. that is, until the moment has finished passing and the me that i am immediately becomes filled with shame at how pathetic i am. I'm not sure if anyone here can relate, or if any of your past 'you's can relate, but i need to hear some words that are going to break this cycle that i feel has been going on forever. I am sick and tired of a life of waiting, procrastinating and stagnating like some rancid old pond. I WANT TO BE A RAGING RIVER crashing though the mountains and down to the valleys!!

I know some of you out there will say ""well if you REALLY wanted to, then you would just do what needs to be done"" but it just aint the way it is. maybe i'm broken? There are a million things i've been telling myself to do for years. a bajillion ways in which i want to change myself. a squillion things on my to-do list but i cant even start.

at 19 i feel like i've looked back over my life so far, and realised that i've spent most of it just bummin around, waiting for something to happen.

If anyone here can tell me what i need to hear, make me be that thing that happens,

i will forever be in gratitude.

No, that’s not what I mean. What I mean is, don’t resist what you feel. Don’t resist anything. It is the cause of suffering. If right now you are feeling sad, say right now to yourself, “I give myself permission to be sad (or whatever it is). It’s truly ok to be sad.” Don’t you feel better already? I mean when you resist an emotion you still feel it, emotions don’t take orders, so you still feel sad, but then you feel bad about being sad on top of it. Yuck. So if you just: got dumped/fired/in a fight with your mom/put on 5 lbs, and you’re feeling lousy, let yourself feel lousy. Lie on the sofa and feel lousy. I once got my heart really broken, only time in my life I wasn’t the one doing the breaking, and man it was terrible. Lying around crying and barely able to function terrible. I went to a meditation with a wonderful teacher, Gangaji (check her out – Gangaji.org), and in a room of 300 people went up on stage to say, “When will this pain end? How can I get out of this pain?” And her advice was perfect – she said, “Let yourself really feel the pain. Really feel it. Then, when you have felt it all the way to the bottom, you will start coming back up. And you will be done.” 

Resisting feeling bad only prolongs it. As I said, don’t hold yourself in a state of suffering. Some people are addicted to feeling bad. I’m talking about honoring whatever real emotion you have. Do keep moving, don’t drown at the bottom of the river, but do float along the river of that feeling until you are gently deposited on the shore. If you try to fake happiness and squash bad feelings, they stay with you. If you let yourself really get in them and just be, just be, then they will eventually slip out the back door of your life. You will be done. Not holding those feelings down with both hands and pretending, but truly done and free of them. We in this country are addicted to being UP, and HAPPY, and SMILING. I lived in France for a year and loved it because there they are fine with crying and raging and being blue and the full spectrum of feelings. Don’t feel you have to be happy all the time. No one is. I am a truly joyful person at this point. But it doesn’t mean I never have a negative feeling. When one shows up at my door, I honor it like any feeling. And I am equally glad when it goes. 

All emotions come and go, don’t get attached. But don’t judge yourself either. Feel what you are feeling, give yourself permission to feel like crap, and it takes most of the power away from the crappy feeling.

",court12b,29,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/149flr/time_for_the_story_of_how_i_went_out_and_found/,"In 2007 I was living with and working for my uncle doing home land surveying. I was 27, 60 lbs overweight(no muscle whatsoever). The high point of my day was spending all my free time feeding my WoW addiction. I was a college dropout. I literally had no friends. I had never held a job for more than two years and I was a virgin. 

One weekend my cousin(Uncle's son) and I went to the local Six Flags where I promptly sprained my lower back on a roller coaster. I didn't know what to do so we went home. I couldn't stand or sit for a week and it was another week till I could stand well enough to get back to work(which was relatively miserable for another few months). 

While I was laying there with my sprained back, unable to get out of bed or even reach a phone and call 911 I truly felt like I'd rather be dead. I made a promise to myself that I would never let myself be in that position again. 

Fast forward 6 months and I finally feel mobile enough to start exercising. I started searching the internet for some excercise programming (didn't know of reddit till last year) and found the Crossfit mainsite. Say what you will about it being insane but as far as I'm concerned, the ratio of Well written, usefull information to bullshit on that site is un-paralleled(or at least, it was at the time). Bodybuilding always seemed like masturbation to me, but functional fitness made and still makes absolute total sense to me. On top of all that, it was free. 

I obviously wasn't able to jump in to it with both feet, but it pointed me in the right direction and I started doing really really scaled down versions of the mainsite workouts and even though I was just getting started, the improvements I felt in mood and confidence were staggering.

It was then and there (end of 2007) that I decided what my life's goal would be. It is my desire to expose as many people as possible in this world to the joy, confidence and benefits that *good* exercise can provide. To me this means good hip flexibility, balance and basic strength. It is my plan to build my own fitness equipment (squat racks, chinup bars..etc) and open a gym. On top of this I will build and sell such equipment along with providing the necessary fitness instruction and programming. 

To become qualified to design and build the steel frames of fitness equipment I decided to get a degree in Mechanical Engineering. I moved back in to my dad's home and enrolled in my local University.  


Four years ago I attended a barbell training cert with Mark Rippetoe and I've been coaching friends and family ever since. 

Three years ago I met the girl who would become my wife. 

Two years ago I landed a well paying internship at an automotive manufactuer that allowed me to develop my experience with welding and 

in two weeks I'll be receiving my BSME. 

I've already built my first squat rack and just picked out a little house on a corner lot with a *huge* garage that will be my first gym.

Then walk down to the end of your block.  Keep walking.  You can walk for as long as you want to walk.  If you want to keep walking all the way until you've reached the city limits, nothing is going to stop you.  You can do that.  

If you want, you don't actually have to stop there.  You can keep going, down the interstate.  You can walk for miles and miles.  When you start to think you'll be getting hungry soon, you can keep that in mind and keep walking until you find a diner or a rest stop.  You can eat there, and even talk to the people who work there if you want. 

You don't even have to stop here, if you feel like you want to keep going.  You can walk and walk and walk for as long as you want to walk.  You can walk from one side of the planet to the other.

The only thing that keeps you from doing anything is that you don't do it.  Nothing else.

EDIT: Forgot to plural a word.
****
I hate how I have to get up in the middle of the night and force myself to run through five miles of humid air, spider webs and long hill climbs. It gets worse because I only have enough time after that to eat a quick meal, shower and rush to work nearly exhausted. I don’t hate my job because it’s at 3AM five days a week; I hate it because I’m on my hands and knees  for 6-8 hours doing mindless mundane tasks, and there’s always one guy who just can’t seem to do it right. After work, I have to exercise AGAIN for another hour or two and when I finally finish that and figure that I have some ME time, I have help babysit and do tasks around the house. Before I know it, I have to go to sleep and do it all over again.

**Attitude Is Everything.**

I love how I wake up so early and am motivated enough to lace up and take on the streets for five miles in the dead of night, knowing that people are sleeping and I’m getting work done. I’m so glad that I have work at 3AM so I could get that out of the way and get on with my day. Work isn’t too bad, I’m listening to music for hours and I’d rather keep myself physically active, moving pallets and products, rather than doing sedentary office work. I wouldn’t know what I would do if I didn’t have the guys at work who actually know what they’re doing. After work, I’ve already got so much done earlier in my day that I’m lucky to have enough time to get a few more hours of exercise in. I end my day by playing with my nephew and helping my mom out with chores, since she deserves any break she could get. Before I know it, I’m dead tired and ready to knock out and do it all over again.",,False,,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,t3_1adyf9,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1adyf9/attitude_is_everything/,

I'm a composer and have been told throughout my life (mostly during education, and by my family) that I would never make any money, that it was a dead-end, that it was a hobby not a career, the list goes on. In fact, my dad once told me I was embarrassing to him for my educational choices. That hurt, but you know what... now I have a successful career. I can barely keep up with my work load, because I decided they don't know what they're talking about. They don't see what I did every day to get to this point, the hours and hours I spent in front of the computer just practicing composing, or the hours I spent behind the piano transcribing, or the hours listening to people that already had careers composing, dissecting their music, etc...

The point of all this is: Don't ignore ambitions, or let failures discourage, or lose hope because someone else before you did. That's what separates you from them. You just may have to try harder than you're comfortable with... But once you get going, the struggle becomes less and less and the rewards greater and greater.

Depending on what you want to do, you need to be a realist. Figure out the standards of the industry, where work can be found, and how to go about it, then just pick a starting point and DO IT. I'm not going to say everyone who thinks they can make a career as an abstract painter will succeed, what I am saying is that if you be real, approach it logically, and gain knowledge from your failures, then you can succeed. Too often people view ""too much work"" and ""too hard"" as the same thing, when they're entirely separate. If you really love something and want to do it, then you just have to work hard. I'm not here to tell you it's easy, you perhaps will have to work harder than you expected, but the results are more than worth it. When you start seeing all the pieces falling into place as a result of lots of hard work, there is literally no better satisfaction in the world.

Sorry if this is cliche, but I've found it to be true. I hope this at least helps 1 person. Heck, even typing it out helped me, so I guess that's good enough. :P",,False,,t5_2qvm1,True,,,True,t3_tg5hn,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/tg5hn/do_what_you_love_career_motivation/,

After a long internal struggle, I decided to continue my long distance training. I got my sneakers on and went outside. I live in Wisconsin, and up until today was the weather nasty and cold. But today, the sky was blue and bright, the clouds were fluffy and white with the sun blazing through the leaves. I knew it was a beautiful day. I plugged in my ear buds and ran. I felt as if I was running in slow motion as I looked at my surroundings. No less than 30 seconds after my ran began, I looked forward and noticed a dog in a yard looking at me eagerly and panting. The dog was tied to a brown leash that my eyes traced to an old woman standing on her deck. I smiled at her as I ran closer to her. When I got near her yard, she spoke to me, ""You know, I wish I could do that."" I looked at her and only grinned. But internally, I felt a surge of energy and motivation that compelled me to run harder. *I felt so alive.* I looked at the surrounding suburbs and noticed people helping move things, children playing with other children and their pets, and dogs rolling around in the mostly green grass. 

Life is phenomenal. Don't waste on things that are meaningless and insignificant. Out of the billions of years that this world will be here, you are only here for around 100 years of it.

Many do not pass such times, but many others do. So what is the trick? Do we take like the rocks, both suborn and strong, and fight the seasons one by one? Do we take to the wisdom of the trees who mould to every change? Or the vast expanses of the timeless rivers? All have survived the age of seasons and are masters in their own ways, but none have truly mastered the might of the seasons. With time even the largest of rocks can crumble and break. A single tongue of flame can consume entire forests. And a dry age can devour the largest of rivers. So what hope do we mere specks of dust have to fight the struggle of the ever changing age of trials?

To survive the test of the seasons you must take to the wisdom of all the masters around you. You must unyielding, stubborn and strong like the rock. You must be wise and as adaptable as the tree. And you must flow as easy as the river. But more than this, you must adopt the greatest lesson life has to teach you, numbers. There is no I, only we. A rock that stands alone, as strong as it may be, will falter and chip away with time until it is but a grain. But together with the help of their brethren one rock can help to form a mountain, vast and immovable to stand against the test of time. Even the countless grains of sand that stand together can hold back the wrath of the thundering sea. A tree that stands alone falls alone to the harsh weather, but together they can form the greatest of forests, stretching as far as the eye can see, protecting each other in many ways. And though a single stream may thin and loose its way, when built with another a river can be forged. An alliance of power and might, standing against even the harshest of heats and strong enough to clear any obstacle that stands in its way. But it doesn't stop there. There are many masters in life that can teach us if we are willing to listen. My heart and ears are open, and my hand is held to you: my ally, my brethren, my friend

If some of us need it, we could disable automatic loading of images within our internet browsers for social networking sites such as Facebook. This way, every time we open up Facebook, we *aren't* bombarded with our friends' latest party pictures, or pictures of x, y, and z, and thus we may be less inclined to compare ourselves to them.

The way I do this is to use Firefox solely for facebook, and disable automatic loading of images for Firefox, whilst using another browser for all my other internet needs.

1364522158.0,19,self.motivation,1b7tf2,Give Yourself A Chance,GooseNuckle,27,8,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1b7tf2/give_yourself_a_chance/,"You don’t become amazing if you keep thinking reasonably.

A person who excels above others, learns to be comfortable when surrounded with doubt, worry and failure. Regardless of how far you fall down, if your constantly focused on getting up, that’s all the reason to keep pushing on. It’s a matter of making the right decisions at the right time and working hard.

Cut the bullshit and just give yourself a chance. If you are struggling with something, just push on a bit longer than you think you can. You’ll find that you are really capable of much more than what you credit yourself.

Physical pain and emotional pain can be overcome with physical strength and emotional strength. It just takes the right mindset to actively pursue it. Complaining and living a life that is governed by doubt, worry and failure wont give you the satisfaction you need to truly be happy.

The best type of failure is the one you get after you’ve tried your hardest not to get. It should fuel you to try harder, think smarter and react better. Good failures bring you down to earth and improve your direction and motive. A good failure makes you think about what you can do to become better.

Bad failures happen when you don’t think things through and you beat yourself up for it. They make you want to quit whatever you were originally pursuing because everything is just too complicated and difficult. Bad failures happen when you fail and automatically begin to think negatively, then find yourself too lazy to find a solution.

Well guess what happens to be the difference between the two? *Good and bad failures are exactly the same.* **It’s your mindset that determines which perspective you ultimately follow.**

It might make perfect sense when you read this, but it’s not until you actually feel like shit and begin questioning yourself that you know what I’m saying.

Like halfway through your first 10 mile run when you think that it just might be too far. Or, halfway through a difficult study session where you find yourself not learning anything after six hours of reading. Maybe you just started a training regime and you gained ten pounds. Shit, maybe you feel like your too old to pursue what younger, better “planned-out” people are pursuing.

I’m talking about that really low feeling you get when things just seem to turn to complete shit. That’s what the words in this post pertain to.

I’m writing this with personal experience. By no means am I great at anything, but on many occasions I’ve managed to fuel myself solely on will power. It is truly motivating to hit any goal and to begin to go farther than you originally planned. The sad thing is, there happens to be just enough hardship between wishing for your dreams and actually achieving them, that so many people to quit way before they ever really began.

Keep in mind that no matter what trouble you may be facing, no matter how significant it may or may not be, you always have to pick one path between two choices: push on or give up. Take my advice, push on, cut the bullshit and just give yourself a chance to succeed. If you just let yourself push on, your goals will be attained, your wishes fulfilled, and your whole life will be elevated a step higher than those who face similar obstacles and choose to give up. 

Give yourself a chance.

But why is it, through-out the day when I'm playing games or something unproductive I never get this urge to work but bed time comes and I get the urge to start working on a project idea I had in mind. Another example is when I'm working (I work in a supermarket) on a Saturday 13:30-22:30. The same thing happens again I want to start working on a project or go running or something which could use to benefit me in the future.

This happens ALL THE TIME, and I'm not asking for some magical solution - just some advice to steer me in the right direction. It's just a constant of the moon rising and work mode activates but I have to go sleep now otherwise I wont be prepared for tomorrows shift or I'll wake up too late

My problem, intrinsically, is this. I enjoy doing my work for some of my classes, because I enjoy learning the material in that class. I enjoy it because I see the connections in the material and between the material and what I want to do with my life. An example is genetics. I really am considering becoming a geneticist, so I think to myself, ""This stuff is important, and the questions it poses are interesting! I'm willing to learn this material."" So I want to practice it, to understand it. However, I then realize that I must put other classes first sometimes. That's where the problem comes in.

Other classes, I enjoy learning the material as well, if not quite as much. Such examples are currently Organic Chemistry and Philosophy 101. First let's look at O Chem. I don't understand this material as well as genetics; it's too much, too fast. But I do pick up a decent amount of it when I spend time doing the work, and when I understand the material, it gives me a sense of satisfaction. I see connections then. I realize why things are important. But I also am aware that I will never use 90 percent of this. So my brain quantifies that material as unimportant, useless. I can't force myself to memorize material for a test and then never use it. I then find myself not studying.

Philosophy is a whole different beast. I really enjoy philosophy in theory. I'd love to look in-depth at the theories behind some of history's greatest minds. But again, we're memorizing material for a test in this crash-course. A list of names associated with schools of thought. A list of fallacies in logic and why they are incorrect. List after list. No one can have a true 'intro to philosophy' in a semester; no real ""understanding"" comes about as a result of such pursuit. I'm wasting my time. So why would I want to study this material? 


I need some motivation. My old motivation for learning was because I effing LOVE it!  I love the childlike wonder that came about when I learned something meaningful. But nothing is meaningful now.

I went to work and during break was in line for coffee. The guy behind me was more than a little attractive and he and I exchanged pleasantries. I opened my mouth to offer to pay for his drink in exchange for a conversation over them. Before I could ask, though, I was bumped from behind. The hot chai tea I'd just been handed fell and stained the front of my new khaki pants. The person bumping me apologized, but then gasped. Apparently the object of my flirtation used to date this person. As I was abandoned with my pants steaming, I looked up to see what could only be America's Next Top Model loudly proclaiming how good looking ""Justin"" was.

I dropped out at 16 for no reason whatsoever. My parents never made me do my homework; my parents always told me that I'm smart, so I figured ""why do it?"". Looking back, I wish I would have done things so much differently, but if I could reverse time, I don't know if it would be even possible for me to do anything different. I would play video games all day long and say to myself, ""tomorrow will be different. Tomorrow I'll catch up"". Tomorrow never came. 

I'm now attending online high school to try and finish up what I started, but I'm having the same problems here that I was having 4 years ago. I start every semester with a smile on my face thinking that things will be different, but day after day I get further and further behind and the mountain piles up once again. I have 6 days to finish basically 1.5 classes' worth of work. The real kicker is that none of it is hard work, it's fucking high school. All I would have to do is google most of the shit, but since it's so time consuming all I do is get bored and do something else. I can't focus for more than 10-20 minutes at a time. I also have to call my teachers once a week for participation. This is 10% of the grade, and I can't even pick up the phone when they call. They call non-stop and I never pick up. I don't know what I'm afraid of. Maybe it's disappointing them? Or that I'll seem dumb, or I'll have to lie my way out of it again like I do for everything in my life? I don't know.

I know that it's possible for me to get better and fix things. I'm still young, but for some reason, just understanding the problem I have won't fix it.

Just remember to Live.,thelastthrowaway1990,24,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1i989w/it_is_what_is_is_just_remember_to_live/,"Ill post anything and everything i can in this one post. might be kind long for some of you but i hope some of you will take the time to at the least read part of it.
I'm using a throwaway because people that know me well know my real reddit name. And this post reveals things i want none of them to know about me.
I am 20 something years old. Born in Early spring 199*. My farther a U.S. Airforce man. i grew up traveling the world. I've been all over this planet from Las Vegas, to the smallest village in Norway. At an early age (2) while living in Italy, I was diagnosed with asthma. This would be the first or many medical problems i would have.
By the age of 5 i was living back in the united states. My grandfather passed away. At this age i didn't truly understand death or what it meant to never to see him again. I saw my dad cry for the first time the day of his burial. This impacted me in a way i didn't quite understand.
Move forward a couple years. im 7 now living overseas again in Germany this time. My mother and father are fighting all the time.I don't really understand it all but it gets to the point where my dad is living one place and my mother in another.
At this age i felt my father had left me to live with my mother because he didn't want me. i didn't understand anything. just that my daddy was gone. My mother started dating other men and moving from house to house living with them.
At one point my mom moved in with this man, for a year or so, and my dad was dating this woman. Now i barely got to see my dad but every time i got to saw him all i really remembered was hours spent in a car driving from northern germany to southern. We would drink sodas (him coffee) eat cheeezits and slim jims, and drive for 3 hours or more. The truck always smelt like slim jims and coffee and i loved it.
My mothers boyfriend was.. an asshole.. he didnt care much about me or my asthma, he drank smoked and had parties every weekend while i was there. MY dads girlfriend quit smoking and changed a lot about her life to accommodate me in to her life. I felt at home there. I liked it and was happy.
After a year or two of driving for 3 hours there and back once a month. My mother announced she was getting married to her new boyfriend and was moving with him to the united states. Well i wanted to live with my dad for a while and i did. I lived with him for 2 years before my mom married him. I went to a german school and everything just so i could spend time with my dad.
But then the time came. My mom was moving back to the USA and i was going to be stuck in a foreign county for an unknown amount of time. even though i hated her husband i wanted so much to be back in schools with english speaking people and to have a semi normal life.
So i made the hardest decision of my life to move with my mom and live with her.
I left my dad i left my step brother i left my half sister and i moved to the USA to live with her and him.
We moved to the fabulous city of Las Vegas, Nevada. This is the point in my life where i experienced.... well ... life.
I was 12, living in las vegas. i managed to get a partime job selling newspapers because i wanted to buy myself a PS2 and play Twisted Metal. But at the same time i also wanted to join the boy scouts and go outdoors and have fun so i did. I sold newspapers on sundays and was a part of the BSA troop 420 (no joke seriously) I bought myself that PS2 and my game and i went on many hiking trips, canoeing trips, and so much more. At this point in my life i met the one person in my life that would change me for the better, and the worst.
Instantly we became best friends and spent every day together. lets call him terry. I spent every day after school at his house to escape my own home away from my step father and i became a part of his family because they saw how much i hated my home life. they were my home away from home. They were my family when i felt like i had none. Me and terry would spend the simple days together and just live life as it was given to us, play video games, watch movies, and explore what life had to offer.
By time i went to high school i made another friend. and we will call him james. The one friend in my life that showed me the evil in life, and the worst in people.
now when i spent time with james we did a lot together but there was one point where his brother got out of jail and managed to get a house of his own and invited us to come hang out with him. Now james's brother would regularly have us over and just chill but one day he offered us beer and what ever we wanted. so being the 14-15 year olds we were we wanted to try it and see what it was like. so we did. At james's brothers house we drank alcohol smoked pot and had a god ol' time. occasionally had parties and slept with very impressionable girls our age, did other hard rugs and just got real fucked up. I got into trouble many times with the law because i was hanging out with him and his brother. one time i was held down at gun point and thrown from a vehicle at full force and 5 or 6 knees on my back, while being screamed at. but we didnt care we were the best of friends and did what we could to enjoy life.
meanwhile terry and i lived a slightly more straight life only smoking pot and maybe having a beer here and there when his dad wasn't home. Terry is basically my brother and will always be thought of as such.
Eventually by the skin of my neck i graduated high school. with a 2.0 gpa. over 190 missed days of school. the last day of my high school year i managed to persuade my history teacher to pass me by giving the most inspirational oral exam on legalization or marijuana i could possibly come up with on the last day of school as i turned into him my pass/fail card.
After this i joined the United States Army. i began my training and did everything i could so i could join. i gave up all drugs alcohol and every thing. i was in a pre-enlistment program where they just did a lot of PT and such to get you in shape and ready to join. during this time i met my future exwife.
Me and her had a connection that was stronger than the toughest metal on earth. we were inseparable i gave everything to her. We had 2 children together, and i was in the army. I traveld the world and went on a few deployments. i went here and ther did this and that. But there was one point where i was gone for just a little to long and she found someone else. She ended up leaving me for him and now they are living together somewhere on this earth.
My children through a lot of court custody trials ended up being given to my mother. So i still get to see them anytime im back in that state.
Im going to fast forward quite a bit here.
i mean quite a bit.
I am now living in a completely different state from anywhere else ive ever been. i lived with my dad for a year i lived with my mom for a while too. but now im on my own living in a 1 bedroom community housing.
I have exactly $6.34 in my bank account. Every penny i had extra to my name i put into 2 CD's for my children. hopefully by the time they are able t to go to collage and everything else these CD's will have matured to be able to take care of their needs.
I dont know where my life wil take me from here. but at this point i dont have much left to live. About 3 months ago i was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor. i was given 3-6 months to live.
I dont know how much time i have left but i know it is nearing an end.
The only thing i wish for is that my children be well taken care of. I have done my best set them up with trust funds and CD's and all that crap and left everything in my will to them.
My advice to you the people of reddit is just to live your life. Live like you have no tomorrow but prepare for it to end in a moments notice. we have a limited control over what happens to us. i may not be here tomorrow i may be. but if im not i want you to know that this was my story. this is a basic knowledge of who i and where i am from and what i have experienced in my life.
i've done wrong and i've done good. i bielive that no matter what the wrong i have done in my life that i will pass knowing i have tried living my life.
Thats what i want all of you to do is just to LIVE.",,False,,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,t3_1i989w,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1i989w/it_is_what_is_is_just_remember_to_live/,

Since then, I finished P90X and started Insanity. The letter is on the long side, but I decided to leave it unedited to post, albeit embarassing.

This is likely the last time in your life you will have nearly three months to change yourself. You had a year in New Jersey and you tried, but failed for valid reasons, and invalid ones. But now, you have one last chance, in a world where they can be so sparse. Don't let yourself down, in a year from now, failure may be something you cannot come back from.

Do it now, have it forever.

Earn this. Earn it for yourself, for your love life, and for the rest of your life.

Think of the confidence you'll have. You want to be that 60 year old dude that looks ripped, well you cant be a 60 year old that looks ripped if you aren't first a 50 year old, 40 year old, 26 year old that looks ripped.

2 hours a day. I am sitting in a mall now, 12, 14, 15 hours a day, it drags on forever, until the 11 hour days seem short. So now you have a chance to do what I could not, for 2 hours a day. Fight for more, Lift and Pull more and more often, earn it, fucking earn it. 

Build up the strength in your knee again, become more durable, healthier.

Sleep more, live longer, last longer in this world.

Write and record, and dont cheat. Dont eat just one cookie, eat just 0 cookies. Chew on some snap peas, or baby carrots, or almonds, don't eat shit.

Go all in for 3 months, see what you have. And if you fail, then you will never have it, will you fail? I wouldn't, if I could work out instead of sitting in this mall, I would not fail.

A man does not fail quietly. If you fail, fail screaming, grunting, and sweating. Fail pulling weight, throwing punches, and jumping.

If you fail, and are dead tired, panting on the ground, then you at least know that you did all you could. But do not fail sitting at your desk playing games. Do not fail without lacing up your sneakers and sweating through your shirt. Fail hard. Fail like you are fighting for your life (and you are, truly.) And at the end, after not being able to make it through 2 workouts, you'll find that you can. And all those days failing, all those lost battles where you stopped and the video kept going, at the end of these 3 months, you'll look back at your pictures, see the cut in your arms, the muscles in your stomach, and the strength back in your knees.

You will be able to lift more, run faster, feel better, live longer. LIVE LONGER.

You are getting older, and unchecked will get slower, fatter, less confident, less good looking. More tired. Think of how tired you have been this year, hours after hours, now is your chance to prepare yourself for the next time you work all those hours a week. Increase your energy, and appearance. Push the limits of what you can do, so that what you have done, is less that what you can now do

This is your choice to do. To succeed or fail. A man can be many things, but a man will say ""fuck off"" to a thing holding him down, will resist, and will conquer it, or fail panting on the floor, with nothing left to fight with. A man takes responsibility, will get the job done, no matter the hours, the mistakes, the hours and the work. You have done this before, do this now. This is for you, your benefit.

Think of all the things you want. The glances from women to validate your confidence, the increase of brute strength. The ability to dominate completely in sports, in every day life, and in bed.

Remember the feeling of not being restricted by your body. Of the first day you noticed you could run longer, lift more, and love longer. When you could play harder, and not feel your heart pound harder and harder until it is all you can hear in your head.

Your body will tell you to stop, your brain will tell you that you have done enough and deserve a break. Break free from those things. Transcend. Choose your path, and tell things in your way to fuck off. A slave to those whims will obey, and sit down to rest. A man will choose to continue, and will continue to fail exhausted, until the day he succeeds, exhausted, and one day, you will just succeed, you will have it.

I can see it now. As I sit in this mall, if I only I could get up and begin now, to help you out. But my job is to make money, your job is to make us happy, earn each day for yourself. You did it for work, now do it for yourself. 2 hours a day is all it takes for you to have it, at long last. Have it, you can! You really can! You are so close. I've been here for 2 solid months of 12-15 hour days. YOU only need 2 hours a day, for 3 months. Commit to it. Prove that you can do it. 

Choose to ignore, push through, grit your teeth, find a way. Find a way to do it. Find it each day, the garage is too cluttered? Move the weights upstairs. Dad wont like that?

To whom it may concern,


in 6th grade(1999) I was diagnosed with depression. I actually was not made aware of it until I discussed moving out of my parents house and them expressing their concerns on me living alone. I have never sought meds as a fix or even to help. I smoked weed for a bit, that helped and spending time with friends helped. I did however hit a weight of 327 pounds and decided that I lived an unhealthy lifestyle(2006). I began working out at the local gym and my mood improved. I was able to socialize talk to girls even obtain an active sex life.



The past 7 years I have developed friendships based off of working out and being healthy, I now help run a workout group every spring and summer. I went from 327 pounds down to 255 in 3 months. It took me years to get a grip though as I struggle with getting motivated. Since the summer I have been coming to grips with a failing relationship, worked grueling hours and have become sedentary once again bringing my weight back up to 300 pounds. The amount of guilt and disappointment I feel each day demotivates me from driving 15 minutes to the gym to work out and it snowballs, but you know what? I am not done, I have a goal, and dammit I'm going to fucking reach it. I know what you may be going through, I have been there, I may even be there with you now. 

I'll make you a promise, 

You will get out of this, you have the power within you to change your life. It is NEVER too late to change your life for the better. It is going to be tough my friend I will not lie, but if you need help, do not be afraid to ask for it as we all need support. There are millions of people just like us and there are millions of people who are here to help us, so remember you are not alone.  Some of us are stepping into uncharted territory, we are declaring war on our old selves.  If you need motivation look at yourself in the mirror and say ""Dammit, you will not bring me down today, I am stronger than ever."" Believe it, because it is true; in every meaning YOU are stronger, emotionally, physically, and mentally. Whatever path you choose to overcome your obstacles, I hope I am lucky enough to meet you on the way. Now go, take that first step to a better you.

I have been spending a lot of time on my own, too much time to be fair. My interest on the outside world has been going downhill, I spend most of my time in front of my laptop working, but whenever I need a break instead of getting out I either come to reddit of play a game. 

Needless to say my need of people interaction spiked lately, but in a very interesting way. 

Whenever I'm out I start random conversations with random people. I look around and spot someone who is looking back at me with interest and just go and talk to them. Its difficult to explain in words because it happens very naturally, its not pep talk, I have no patience for pep talk, I just start talking about a random subject and wait to see whether the person whom I am talking to has something to say. Once a middle ground is found I talk with them for about 2-5 min, then leave when we both stop talking with nothing to say about the given subject anymore. I politely let them know it was nice to meet them and excuse myself out.

He must be late 50’s early 60’s. He’s very well groomed with a chin strap and mustache, completely white, a little bald on top but longer hair down the sides and back. He’s wearing a pink sweater, white dress and a broche. He looks clean, well groomed and pretty for a man in a dress. My first reaction was a bit of a chuckle and a hope that I could steal a picture to share with my wife because I didn’t think she would believe me. However I’ve been sitting her for 15 minutes and it’s impossible not to notice the chuckles and the looks of disgust and ridicule. I’ve reconsidered my own first impression and have been thinking a little bit deeper; this is what I think now:

It’s almost like he is wearing his weird outside. We all fear what people think of us, he’s getting it out of the way right from the beginning. If people think he’s weird and worth making fun of then he knows that they aren’t the type of people he would want to speak to or associate with anyways. We see it as identifying him but really it identifies us. This is why you need to be yourself and not life in fear of what other people think because they will identify the type of person they are and you can decide whether or not theyre worth your time.

I want to open up a non-tradition, second-run movie house that also plays art films and has some live theater and comedy.  I have never worked in any of those fields. But it is my life's dream.  

I have been a performer and got bit by the improv comedy bug way back in the day (15 years ago) and they are some of my fondest memories.  

There is an abandoned six-screen theater in my town that is just SCREAMING at me every time I think of it.  I want a cultural spot for people in my area.  I want to start a YouTube channel that chronicles the building up and running of such a venture.  I want to spin off channels for the comedy and plays to run on.  I want friends and family to join and have a great time running something for everyone in the area and around the world to enjoy.

But I do not know where to start .... at all.

I started my career in IT when I was 18 before I knew who I was.  Now I am 37 and I am someone else entirely but never learned to do anything but this.  40+ hour weeks and a family on a tight budget leave no room for educating myself to do something new.  

Has anyone else jumped careers and started something new and maybe have advice, motivation, insight, venture capital that could help me move in the right direction for this dream?

What is worse is, my now 13 year old son knows my dreams and watches me flounder through life not being motivated to work harder at the job I have.  He knows I want to entertain and enlighten people.  He has recently been acting at school and is growing a passion for it way younger than I ever did.  It breaks my heart to watch as he grows up seeing me not reaching for my dreams.

Starting to get fit is a bitch.,DrummerDKS,16,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1kflaj/just_graduated_starting_my_job_hunting_was_easy/,"Let me start off by saying that I've starting working out before and fell through. Multiple times. Career-wise, I'm very motivated. I just graduated from university and I want to find that job of my dreams and I'm gonna do whatever I can to get there.

My problem is that I don't feel like I've seen any results anytime I've worked out. I wrestled for 4 years until grade 10 and didn't recognize any change in my body for years after hating 80% of wrestling. It didn't make me feel good, I didn't enjoy it, that's why I quit. The last stint I had with working out, I gave it a solid 2 months of going to the gym 4 days a week for an hour and a half and 2 days of cardio, resting on sunday. I've been watching my diet, avoiding fatty foods, gave up pop and beer, started drinking tea and water like a fish. I just don't feel like I've seen ANY results. I lost maybe 5 pounds after those 2 months and it frustrated me so much I didn't keep it up. Honestly, as much as I know it isn't true, it truly feels like it doesn't matter what I do to my body, shy of becoming a completely different person, I'm not even going to kinda change. I'm about 5'10"", and I'm locked in to about 175 pounds no matter fucking what I do. I'm not obese by any stretch of the mind, but I'm sick of my chub, love handles, and lack of any real definition but I just can't seem to do anything to show that it will change it. I'm not expecting instant results, I know it's going to take a while and that I'm prepared for. But for anything I do, it doesn't seem like anything will change no matter what. What's the point of beginning to workout if the only difference is making myself uncomfortable by a workout instead of being comfortable playing a game, watching a movie, drawing, or another hobby. For me, working out feels like time wasted become I've got nothing to show for it and wanted to cut my losses (of time).

I don't know what the fuck to do, but I'm sick of it. If I can change my 12 hours a week of working out that I was doing and actually make them productive, I know I'll stick to it. But I've changed my workouts to become more intense for fuck all. I'm pretty sure I've got a friend who will lend me Insanity, so I'll see if that helps at all, but at this point I've got low expectations and will likely quit if nothing else changes, after all, if nothing measurably changes, what's the point? I don't care for the ""just so I can say I did it"" aspect. I could go outside and beat a tree with a stick for a few hours and it would seemingly render the exact same results.

**TL;DR:** Feeling defeated. Working out seems to not do shit, no matter how much time I put into it. I quit. I want to unquit.",,False,,t5_2qvm1,1376590811.0,,,True,t3_1kflaj,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1kflaj/just_graduated_starting_my_job_hunting_was_easy/,

1364344561.0,12,self.motivation,1b2uy7,Trying to motivate myself by turning my life into a video game.,Rakoras,18,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1b2uy7/trying_to_motivate_myself_by_turning_my_life_into/,"I'm pretty much addicted to video games. It's not hard for me to play over five hours a day. I enjoy playing them, but it's kinda getting in my way of doing the things that I really want to do. But I thought about what I like most about games, and that is being able to see my progress even if I don't finish the game. In life, you only get a real sense of accomplishment if you actually finish the things you've set out to do. What scares me is that, in five to ten years, I'm gonna look back at my life and realize the only thing I've done is played a bunch of video games. But I want to read, draw, write, build stuff, and learn new things.

So I've been working on something that I call ""Life Book"". Every time I do something I've been keeping track of it and tallying it on a list. And I created a leveling system. So I feel some sense of accomplishment. For eg. My Sudoku Skill is Level 6 with 3 experience points. When my experience reaches 6, the skill level will become level 7. Which means I have done Sudoku 24 times since I started this project. As I continue to expand this book, I will add parts like doing expert level Sudoku.

One of thing that I have benefited most by doing this, is that I can keep track of what things I haven't been doing often. I often feel like I just did something, and then I figure out it's been 3 month since I last did it. But now I have proof. If my video game level is a 107 and my journal writing is at level 2, then I really need to start on my writing. It can also be used to see more clearly what things you like to do. And then when I ask myself down the road, ""What have I been doing with my life?"", I can just look and see.

I even set up a day system. Today was Tuesday, which means that I need to do one thing involving creativity and one thing involving learning. Today I worked on building a character for a book and Hidato puzzles. Every day I have different tasks. I've also been keeping list of ideas of possible things I could do for the day. Like for learning I have A list of puzzles, things to read, and things I want to learn.

This may seem like going overboard, but it is the only thing that has kept me motivated for more than a week. I've been keeping up with this for more than 5 months now. Though I do often forget to tally the things that I've done for the day, but with time it will become second nature to me. I feel like if just play games all day, I may end up glued to my chair with nothing to offer anyone or even myself. It might be a crazy idea, but if at least one person can take something from this and better themselves, then I'm happy.",,False,,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,t3_1b2uy7,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1b2uy7/trying_to_motivate_myself_by_turning_my_life_into/,

You Are!",blisslovefun,15,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/16uixm/do_you_feel_worthy_of_love_wealth_success_health/,"Some people create the most amazing lives for themselves. I have a friend who was a single mom pumping gas at a gas station after college who now owns, OWNS, 2 real estate agencies (not to mention a gorgeous house in Cape Cod and another on an island in the Bahamas. She's 42). Then there are people like Martha Beck, the fabulous life coach who has a column in Oprah magazine and has written several books. She travels the world telling people how to live well, be happy. She recently spent a couple of weeks being paid large amounts of money hanging out at a luxury game reserve in Africa helping clients find their inner potential. How do people pull these things off? Well hard work for sure. Work and passion. But there is a piece that is often missing in creating the lives we want and it's a hard piece to nail down - worthiness. Do you feel worthy of wealth? Success? Love? Health? Key Lime Pie? (that's an important one for my quality of life). Self worth like the cousin of self love, we have to feel self love to be able to allow goodness to fall into our lives. I feel like it often does fall in, if we just keep busy loving ourselves, amazing things just appear, sometimes out of nowhere, right?! But worthiness is like self love's cousin - I think it's when self love materializes, becomes specific.Feeling worthy seems to me like knowing it's ok to receive specific things in our lives. So, do you feel worthy of love? Do you feel worthy of a rocking body? Of wealth? It's hard to grab worthiness with two hands and really have a good look at it, for me anyway. It's a slippery little bugger. So to get in touch with this slippery guy, if there is a part of your life that is not flourishing as you'd like it to, try this:

Get a beautiful leather bound journal, (or scrap of paper covered in spaghetti sauce like in my kitchen) - and write:

""I don't feel worthy of _____ because..."" and write down every single thing that pops into your head before you even think about them. Let even the really bad ones come out. Don't edit, don't think you're being too harsh, or silly, or anything. The things that fly our of you in this moment are what you believe so get them out. Now have a look at what you wrote. Some may hit you kind of hard. The truth hurts is an expression for a reason. Somewhere way back when most of us get injured and we internalize it, we feel unworthy of something in life. And when it's unconscious, it's powerful. Once we take those things out in the sunlight and look at them and understand them, they loose their power. So now try this:

Rewrite those feelings in positive terms. If you wrote, ""I feel unworthy of wealth because I'm a bad person."" Switch it to read, ""I am worthy of wealth and prosperity, it flows to me freely as I am a loving and generous person."" Or whatever...just write something positive and self loving and even if it feels fake, it's ok. Say that sentence to yourself any time you think of it all day, every day and just that action will slowly start to change that belief. At first you'll be faking it, but slowly you'll actually believe, because it's true! And your inner self knows that, it's just buried under someone else's garbage that they dumped on that sense of worthiness many moons ago.

So imagine the most amazing, fabulous, glowing life you can - job you love going to every day, fit energetic body, financial prosperity, true love, imagine it all and then know you're worth it! Tell the universe your worth and you will see your life change. You will receive what you believe you are worth. So you better up the value on the cosmic tag hanging off your soul! (and of course I'm not talking just about money here with this heavy financial metaphor, I'm talking about joy!) If you think of yourself as bargain basement, that's the sort of life you'll create. Know that you are worth the gold, luxury, diamond studded life that you desire. And let the riches begin to flow!",,False,,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,t3_16uixm,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/16uixm/do_you_feel_worthy_of_love_wealth_success_health/,

Being happy, or being lazy?",shaykai,17,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1hi6i7/whats_harder_being_happy_or_being_lazy/,"I was having a conversation with a friend the other day and I spouted off this little gem I thought I would share. We were discussing whether its more difficult to be lazy, or more difficult to go out and do things that make you happy.

This isn't some 'trick' response where I say that being lazy is actually HARDER to do. Nope, going out and doing things, being social, creating experiences, etc.... all of that requires EFFORT. No bones about it, going out is definitely a lot harder than staying in, especially if you have any introverted tendencies. 

But the efforts are worth it. I have been in the doldrums for a bit because I've had a rough 2013. Yesterday while messing around on my guitar I decided to record myself playing a cover of Imagine Dragons - Radioactive. Now, I'm definitely not a great singer, but I love creating things even though it requires effort on my part. After I recorded the song I edited together a video of some experiences of my life. All of the things in the video required a ton of effort, it would have been much easier to just stay at home and surf the computer or watch TV. But if I would have done that I wouldn't be able to look back on these experiences and be reminded of those victories. Reminiscing helps to inspire me to create MORE memories in the future!

**If you are curious about the video you can check it out here:**

I need your help for a bit of motivation, I'm at the end of my third year for a BSc in Computer Science and I'm having some issues with getting motivated. I need your honest opinions, and if I'm being a fucking pussy, please tell me that because it can only help.

Back in October we had to submit a proposal for our dissertation, in which my supervisor gave me 53% and said it wasn't worth that (he told me he wanted an overview, I went to him a week or two before it was due and asked what I needed to change) - in the feedback he told me I hadn't gone into enough detail (what?)

So, that pretty much killed most of my motivation at the start of the year. I've moved onto other assignments, going through the motions and generally scoring an okay mark for them, but the time has comne to face the truth.

If I don't attempt to make a start on this dissertation now (I should have started months ago) I'm going to fail, but knowing that guy's marking it is just getting me down, he seems like the sort of person who will poke holes in absolutely anything...

I've been feeling a bit introspective today and I think I've had a bit of a breakthrough.

I messed up my A-Levels 4 years ago due to alcoholism and just generally going off the rails whilst in sixthform. I'm now working full time and have done since, its not great pay or what I want to do, but its a job.

Growing up I was sort of exceptional, I was quite well rounded and I'm not just saying it. I had a lot going for me, then when I turned 16/17 I kind of went a bit wild.

The last 4 years I have generally been feeling quite down about it all, like a failure. My drinking got worse and I completely lost a lot of flair for life. I didn't fail them because I'm stupid I failed them because I didn't try/care, my GCSE'S were good. I just didn't really want to be there, I should have took an apprenticeship (my mum expected me to go to sixthform though).
My problem really is (was) my ambition set against my notion of success, I am highly ambitious but I was geared toward the wrong things for the wrong reasons. I was gunning for careers/lifestyles for the money/prestige/status of said careers. I was looking at my peers, most by now fresh out of university who supposedly have ""much better prospects"" and allowing that arbitrary statement fuel my lack of self worth. I'd missed the last train to ""a better place"" and that's all that mattered - I fucked up.

Basically in a massive rut.  Ultimately, I felt I was inadequate because I was so far from what I once imagined I would be at this point.

Then, today - I realised how much I was pandering the rat race. I was letting my own purpose, happiness and worth be defined by everybody else. I neglected to appreciate how lucky and unburdened I am, and I started to see thing differently:

-Young

-Little debt

-Not locked in to a degree career path

-Free to go back to college if I want

-Got a job

-Gay and don't want kids

What I'm saying is, I don't need all those excess material things. I was so blind-sided by the competitive, consumer mentality I grew up with, I completely lost sight of what's important. I can do whatever the fuck I want. Its not too late, and if anything - I'm better for my experiences and bad decisions. 

Now, I'm going to aim for a job/career I love doing no matter what it is - the pay is secondary priority. As long as it affords me a modest lifestyle I don't care. And I don't care what my peers are doing, or how other people measure success. The only one that matters is my own.

I'm going to start writing again and finish the novel I started, read more - appreciate simple things. Go camping/hiking more often. Im going to prioritise travel, experiences and my relationships with others. I already volunteer, and Im going to do more. Meditate and practice mindfulness. Try new hobbies. Look after my body. I'm going to stop squandering my money on frivolous indulgence and practice frugality. Self sufficiency. Just some of the things I am going to draw my success from.

I just feel like all my life I was pressured to be a certain way, to the point my self image was always going to cause feelings of low self worth.

Don't listen to them.

Anybody can be a hero when the wolves are at the door. But a true champion, the truly successful, they don't wait for their first heart attack to start losing weight. 

If you want to truly be successful, if you want to truly change your life, start now. Abandon your excuses. Abandon your doubts. Start today.

Your enemy is not failure. Failure you makes us stronger, it shows is where we can improve.

Your true enemy is apathy. Getting comfortable. ""I'll start tomorrow"". Tomorrow is too late. Don't wait for your heart to stop. Don't wait for the wolves to close in. Life is change, so if your comfortable you're dead.

I'm turning 21 in about a week, and I'm a miserable failure.

I'm studying computer science at a pretty damn good institution, and I passed my first two years easily due to prior knowledge and good habits. However, I'm about to finish my third year, and I've dropped a class and am failing another one.

I simply don't give a shit about anything anymore. I spend all my time playing videogames and watching anime, I don't go to classes, I barely turn assignments in. I just for some reason find no purpose in anything right now.

I've got a summer internship working with a company that does software development, and it will be fun, but for some reason school itself just makes me want to gag and turn off my brain completely. I feel like there's some creative gene in me that could do some really cool stuff (I love cooking, for example) but my current degree and studies have just become an absolute theory-ridden slog.

Hell, I could honestly see myself dropping out and going to culinary school or something, it would be a hell of a lot more interesting than this, and I'd meet people who actually enjoy what they're doing instead of slogging through to a degree.

I was wondering if anyone's been in a similar situation and what you did to get out of it.",,False,,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,t3_t6ord,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/t6ord/21yearold_college_student_looking_for_motivation/,

I say ""end"" because I still have three tasks left. 

The middle part of my ten days was less than stellar. I tried very hard to keep things going, in the end did a couple of things in the same way the cafeteria lady slops on the 'tuna surprise'; and skipped some. I have three tasks left, and they WILL be accomplished. 

I went to the gym again, and after weightlifting ran. This time, however, I only went half the distance as my hip started to complain at me. But it did feel good. and I bought a new pair of workout pants, which made me feel better about how my butt looked. Small, but helpful :)

Tonight, as the closing ""celebration"" to my 10 For 10, I found a recipe to cook and feed my family. (Something my mother has begged me to do since high school.) So I made a [list](http://i.imgur.com/R6mh6.jpg), successfully [conquered the store](http://i.imgur.com/1JIwS.jpg), and [purchased](http://i.imgur.com/sqDva.jpg). For future reference, those of you who have never experienced Meijer, should. 

First, i [assembled](http://i.imgur.com/ZQxxr.jpg) the [desserts](http://i.imgur.com/4vm6d.jpg) to chill (yes, I am on reddit there), then [cooked](http://i.imgur.com/ZV2yl.jpg) and baked my [Mexican Lasagna](http://i.imgur.com/zOzLA.jpg)

It all was a hit! I feel super motivated right now to get my butt in gear for my next ten days. I'm going to start it on Monday :) I may update to r/diaries if anyone is interested, but I don't want to clog up r/motivation any more than I already have. Thanks guys, for sticking in there with me. Ten more days of making my life better!

I'm 15 years of age and going in to sophmore year in high school (in Sweden).  Last week I had an epiphany, I have no idea what I want to do in life.  I know people will tell me I'm young and I have plenty of time, but I don't want to run out of time. I play basketball and I'm quite good, I'm on the Swedish National Team for 16 and under. But I really don't know if I want to gamble on that. I'm quite short 5'9 but my projected height is about 6'3 (my father and his family are all over 6'3 and my mom is 6'0). I really think I have the work ethic to be sucessfull at it but I feel like how hard I ever try there's always going to be some 6'5 American guy 2 years younger than me trying even harder. Even though that is the fact I still feel like I can for example get injured and I want an education to fall back on. 

I kind of cruised through elementary school (1-9th grade) and graduated with a 305 score. (16 subjects, 10 A's 6B's) I didn't really try hard until ninth grade, and I realized working hard feels so much better than cruising and convincing yourself your better than anyone else. Going in to sophmore year I chose a line with the concentration of Chemistry, Biology and Physics. 

My entire family (in the US) went to different top colleges/universitys (Yale, Stanford etc.) and I feel a lot of pressure to do good in high school and move abroad for college. I have no idea what I want to become and I just had this on my chest and it felt really good putting it out here. 

Does anyone else relate to this/has anyone else related to this? How dis it pan out?

Thanks for reading this, I just felt i had to get this off my mind and I couldn't think of anywhere else to post it.

I care for 20+ people with severe mental illness on a daily basis. My mom is a widow, still grieving. My partner of 7 years is diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, and though he is doing much better these days, still requires quite a bit of reassurance, empathy, patience, etc. My two very best friends are absolutely full of their own issues. 
So here's the thing: people rely on me. I know this, I like this. I allow this. I allow myself to be taken advantage of and I really suck at setting boundaries and limits sometimes. All these people in my life DO genuinely care about me, but there are days when even though I need to talk about my shit, I feel guilty for taking time away from them. I'm also uncomfortable talking about my shit to others. Makes sense I'm a social worker - very one-sided relationship. I love being there for others, I really do. And I am trying to work on my own wellbeing and self-care by not answering the phone, remembering that people can care for themselves, blah blah. But some days I just want someone to ask ME how I'M doing, you know? Without just waiting for me to finish talking so they can talk. I'm so burned out in my life that I'm not even doing a very good job of caring for others anymore. I'm spending most days at work (when I'm not with clients) on reddit, counting the hours until I can go home, then to bed. So I'm not sure if I need motivation to get back to actually working and getting shit done, or if I'm looking for someone to check in with me regularly, maybe just an email once a day or a few times a week...someone I can vent to, and maybe get some feedback once in a while. For once, I want the relationship to be therapeutic for ME, not the other person. 
Is that asking too much? 
TL;DR Somebody please care about me for once and help me get my shit back on track. ",,False,,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,t3_1i110n,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1i110n/not_sure_if_im_looking_for_motivation_or_just/,

Put aside 5 minutes to look at yourself shirtless in the mirror an think. Think about how disgusted you are with how you look. Think about how disappointed you are with your lifestyle. Think about how if you skip a work out today, you are only proving to yourself that you aren't ready to change. If you still feel like doing nothing, feel free. You can either use your depressed state to crack open a bag of chips and a soda, then sit on the couch and play video games. Or, you can use your emotions to better yourself. Start a workout right away and don't stop thinking about the dark thoughts swirling around in your brain. You are garbage--but right now, you are going to make every effort so that tomorrow you will be a little stronger. A little more confident. With every rep you do, really feel it. Think about how every rep and every set is another step out of hell. You will get tired faster, you will get stronger faster. When you have finished your workout, you have no reason to hate yourself. Think about how proud you are of yourself. Think about how you can't wait to hate yourself tomorrow so you can feel even better than you do now. Think about if you keep it up for another week, the changes to your body will be vastly visible. 

Let your emotions control your urges, and let a clear look at yourself control your emotions. The only one who can make you better is you, and you shouldn't be satisfied until you can look yourself in the face and say you're happy.

Struggling writer.,TERRiBEAR,11,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/uu2v7/can_someone_give_me_advice_on_how_to_get_out_of/,"I hope you can forgive me, but this is kind of my last resort before I just give up and die on the inside… I know I just made this account, but I've been around for quite a while I assure you. I also know that my situation isn't as important as some else's, but I'd really like a cure for this... I'm going to be as clear as possible for you, and I'm going to keep an open mind for all answers, or questions.


I'm a 20 year old living with a minor form neurosis, and I can't be motivated to do anything. I was stressing about it for a long time, but now I've just accepted that I can't be motivated, save for that occasional ""spur of the moment"" where I manage to be inspired, but the inspiration quickly dies… Okay... Deep breath in... submitting *now*.


There's a lot that factors into my current status, but I'm going to try and bring up the important parts and leave out the small details no one wants to hear. Don't worry, I'll try to add ""TL;DR"" at the end of this for those who lack the interest or attention-span to read.


I am born and raised in the bible belt, and to paint a better picture for you, I'll point out that I live within a 30 mile radius of the Westboro Baptist Chruch( but I'm probably a lot closer then that). While it pains me to know I'm so close to the pinnacle of religious ignorance, it is the least of my worries. I entertain the idea of doing some not-so-nice-things to them (sabotage) I really don't have the luck, intelligence or determination to do any prank on them. Although I'm not Christian, I do have respect for the Golden Rule. (I'm agnostic, because I don't believe you can prove or disprove anything. It's my personal opinion. That usually spares me from debates based on religion, which I find such a drag… I hope you guys won't give me heat about it. It's not why I'm here…)


Just a small town girl, oblivious to the very disturbing disfunction's of my family. I don't remember very much from my childhood, at all.


I grew up with my mother leaving from my small town, to drive to the city to work in a hospital as an ER nurse. She would come back on weekends, but all I remember is her sleeping a lot. During the week, my father is the one who drove us to school and picked us up. I don't remember my father ever being violent with me, but there were scuffles between him and my teenaged brother and sister. A lot of things happened, and my mom was oblivious to a lot of it. So was I, because I never became self aware of anything until just around the time they divorced.


My sister and brother graduated, and they sort of fell off the map. Brother entered the Navy. Sister fell in love with a loser and became addicted to meth for a while.


My parents divorced, I bounced between the two of them for eight years. I think my social anxiety (even that term is an understatement) stems from that, and transfering to new schools all the time.


My sister, who you guys would love, hates me after this last argument. She used to be a model, now she works to jobs. She strips for the Shriners when they request her. Her boyfriend doesn't know. She didn't believe I was looking for a job… and her boyfriend, who moved in, doesn't like me either. The negativity was killing me, and it didn't help that I couldn't find a job, not even in fast food. That's just fine because I don't see her as family anyway. (I have no sibling that is of full blood, only half-sibling.) My brother actually encouraged me to ""go make something of myself to prove to everyone I'm a bad ass"" when I was leaving. It was nice of him to say that… Uhh… My ""boyfriend"" (a term he and I both agree to be overused and terrible) encouraged me to go to school, because I could make something of myself where as he can't anymore… I won't go into his story, but if there are questions about anything, anything at all, I'll answer them. It's only been a week, and I'm alone during the week… I have all the time in the world to surf, masturbate, chat, role-play, etc… but I do little of any of such things.


I love to write, at least I used to. My boyfriend, who we'll call Ben, found some of my files on the computer and praised them, like they were really that amazing. Any guy would say that to a girl they liked, so I didn't take it to heart until recently. Ben in just like me, and he knows me more than I know myself… but, fuck (…lol) I hardly know who I am. The one thing we don't have in common is passion. He has all the passion in the world, so much passion--more than any person I've ever met has, and horsepower to do whatever he's passionate about. I don't. I find comfort in his company, more comfort that I've felt since I can't remember. I'm not worried about dying alone because of him, and I'm not worried about things turning to shit like the last guy, and getting scary. But that's all. While he pushes me to read Carl Sagan, and posts punk and indie and whatever folk band on my Facebook, and ugh--he is a Star Trek nerd, which I'm sure is where it all stemmed from. He loves the Neil deGrasse Tyson quotes that I post on his Facebook (that I get from reddit, but he doesn't browse reddit… So everything I give him, he passionately, unknowingly up votes it.) and all the things that relate to space (also find on reddit.)


I spent most of all my life in front of a computer (dad made me PC's for me upon request) and I got into games for a while, because I wanted to play Battlefield 1942 with my dad… Then I got into a site that posted fiction (and occasionally fan fiction, but the site turned to shit when Nickalodeon bought it out). I loved to write--I LOVED to write then. Then I got turned onto role playing, and I LOVED that. Met my ex through it. (He wanted me more than he wanted to role play though, that's when I lost interest.) He was very literate, posted multiple paragraphs, and we did everything thinkable. However he never presented ideas, which is sad. Now I've got games, stories and role playing out of my system… but I would like to write again… Ben is really hoping I pick up where I left off in the scifi stories I write, and then abandon.


Reddit, if you could help me with any of my problems, help me get motivated again. I honestly have spent all week looking at inspirational videos, going to websites specially for the unmotivated, and all other things I could think of. Ben tells me I'm just stressed, but I'm not anymore… I live in a quiet house, I don't have to work, I have plenty of food and a warm, soft bed, and plenty of time on my hands. (Only catch is I have to go to college and get a degree. Think I'll be a cop, just for the financial security. If I tried to go into anything like screenwriting, I'd kill myself. The technicalities and things--so anal.) I really do like writing… It's all I ever liked doing. I didn't like going to movies, or to the park, or to the clubs, or any special event… Just writing in solitude… but I can't even do that anymore. I'm not far from going out like Elliot Smith (I appreciate those of you who don't have to google what I mean). I don't know what to do to get over this funk… but I've be very grateful if I just got advice, or help. I'm asking for help, and hoping that I won't catch a whole fuckton of trolls… That's the last thing I need right now is assholes from /b/.


**TL;DR** I'm a sad sack who can't get no motivation. Please help? 


If you don't want to read it all, read the paragraph above at least. I left out a lot of paragraphs to spare you the story of a sad sack. I'm sure no one wants to hear about how dysfunctional my family is, so I'm just gonna leave that shit out. And I left a lot of stupid shit out.

The problem with me is despite knowing that I shouldn't get angry at such miniscule things I can't help but spiral into complete frustration and anger when things happen. For example:

Last night I went to bed happy, went to the gym, finished up some work, it was all good. So today I wake up (hoping it to be a good day) and log in only to realize that a $3000 scholarship for school (that I normally get every semester) won't be coming the following semester, because they couldn't issue enough. Okay here, in the past, I'd probably have been pissed off...but I've read and learned enough that I shouldn't take everything so badly, I shrug my shoulders.....""whatever""  I tell myself.

I look at my phone bill and realize I was charged over $30 for ""roaming"", 2nd time they've done this and it's going to take me 40min waiting on the phone to clear this charge, HUGE waste of time. Then I get a call from my boss saying I have to come into work on Wednesday (I had plans and asked for the day off, he said 95% sure he can do it, apparently not).

So now I'm super pissed off AT EVERYTHING, big things, small things, irrelevant things. I HATE this feeling. I mean a guy was using his weedwacker outside and I got irritated, heard a bunch of people talking loudly outside my apartment and mumbled to myself ""why can't they just shut the fuck up!"", phone range twice within 10 minutes and I'm thinking ""leave me the fuck alone and stop calling!!!!""

How do you relax when you're in that state? It's a lot harder to just tell yourself ""relax! relax! relax!"", it doesn't work! I feel like it's impossible to overcome the shitty feeling in that situation, and I hate waiting for it to subside (because sometimes it lasts all day).

Are there any methods you guys suggest for feeling better in these types of situations???

Basically I'm a four-year student in college and I'm stuck home for the summer working at a dead-end job. I just had a horrible breakup with a person I very much liked but who had become distant. I really want a way out, either some way to make money doing something that I actually feel good at (like computer programming or web design, not cutting cheese into 1/4 ounce slices), or I want to make something that reaches out to people and makes them smile (it's one of my dreams to be able to make a large amount of people happy).

**THE PROBLEM**:
Problem is I have trouble when doing things, be it making a web site, youtube video, drawing, comics, writing. I am not very good at many of these things due to lack of practice, but whenever I practice I get so discouraged at my bad work and how long it's taking to get better. I have ADD and when I'm depressed my concentration is especially short so I keep fluttering between things and never getting any real work done.

Some of you expressed an interest in knowing how it was going. 

I've already told you about how my trip to the gym was in my original post. Wednesday was the day I filed my taxes. I was not very happy about it. The type of work I do has to be filed as self-employment, therefore the government was very pleased to ask me to part with over a thousand dollars. Luckily, I'd been saving for this. 

Thursday was the day I'd assigned to finally write a short story that had been bouncing around in my head for a little while. I muddled through it, not my best work at all and mostly had a crap-tastic day. 

Friday was a little bit better. I made it to the Art gallery, my thing of the day. Also, it was a bit warmer and sunnier, so the weather helped. 

Yesterday... yesterday i ended up going into work. While it wasn't awful, it wasn't very pleasant. I came home with aching feet and an impending headache. I sat down with my laptop and didn't get back up until i went to bed. instead of marking off the day, I circled it. my thing of the day was not done. 

Today was unfortunately similar. My thing of the day hovered over me until very late. it was nearly midnight before I started and I honestly don't intend to finish it before going to bed. Though it was beautiful and summer-like outside my door, a poorly timed facebook status in a moment of weakness kept me in the basement stuffing myself with ""fun-sized"" chocolate bars. I finally went for a walk during my last hour of sunlight, but was called by a friend which sadly resulted in a... well, not an argument, but a heated discussion about something we disagreed. I felt vilified, he felt belittled, it was frustrating. 

i don't really know where to go from here. Tomorrow I have the gym down once more. My hip hurts and tomorrow promises to be nightmarish at work, not to mention I'm back-logged two days already. this is not where I hoped to be right now. 

Should I skip my days I didn't finish or should I make up for them? should I push everything forward two days?  what do you think, reddit?",,False,,t5_2qvm1,False,,,True,t3_gn606,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/gn606/update_10_for_10/,

1364270676.0,7,self.motivation,1b0tj5,"Motivation for those who are already motivated. My thoughts on progressing from ""great"" to amazing. (Wall of text warning!) ",GooseNuckle,8,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1b0tj5/motivation_for_those_who_are_already_motivated_my/,"I believe that the majority of our lives are lived with mental presumptions about everything. Our lives are made to outline a constant stream of routines. The reason for this, is probably to develop monotonous tasks into habits in order for our brains to take a back seat on constantly processing new information. This reduces the daily mental stress we endure and creates a bubble of well being within our respective lives.

What I've come to realize is that our subconscious decisions really drive the way we deal with life, and there are two obstacles that came to mind that I think, prevent us from truly becoming better than our best. 

First, is our contentment for group assimilation. When your peers accept and maybe even begin to praise your accomplishments, it's simple to lose a bit of steam as goals become satisfied and priorities begin to shift. Second, is our preference for an undisturbed equilibrium. It's so easy to simply get comfortable with a certain workload, especially if it's a bit higher than your immediate peers. Things become manageable and the ole' adage: ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" might start to take hold in your mind.

Assimilation, the safest level of social acceptance. Essentially, it's to think the same way that the community does. Like-minded people will get along because they share similar values, which usually reproduce predictable, desirable actions. This fits well with creating habits and routines because it explains why we like working with people who help us get things done.

Equilibrium. We all tend to cultivate our lives─and the things that affect us, into predictable, reliable tasks in which most of us strive to perform as best we could. Our good days happen when everything goes as planned. And usually, our bad days are bad because of unexpected kinks that show up and make us work a bit harder than originally planned.

Explaining these factors may seem as if I’m sputtering out common sense, but realizing these two simple realities is the first step to understanding what separates great people from becoming exceptional. We become so relaxed in these behaviors that they become to own our subconscious decision making. We then develop ideas, attitudes and habits─*that have the ability to run our lives*─based on ideals that have been cultivated *without* our conscious consent. 

We should NEVER be content upon assimilation to a group ideal or idea. It might be great for developing your initial senses for a specific subject matter, but I believe that as soon as the individual surpasses their relative naivety and begins to gain his/her senses and bearings, they should immediately transition from being a follower to becoming a leader. They must take on the difficult task of paving new ground in order to make way for themselves and set the example for those following suit. They need to find and/or create material that could further progresses them, which in turn, ultimately further enriches society as a whole. Even if it means doing it under the shadows of doubt, with no backers and by their lonesome.

When our lives become manageable, it’s commonplace to feel a sense of contentment and peace. On a short time scale, figure days and maybe weeks, finding this equilibrium can do wonders for stress levels, which in turn, has a positive affect on our overall mood. But I believe that becoming reliant on maintaining such equilibrium will eventually cause a negative impact in our lives.  Bad days come, moods vary and things change. *Having a preference for an undisturbed equilibrium will make the bad days worse and the good days mundane.* 
 
We should always be trying to move from bad to good, good to better, and so on. I found that when I find myself frustrated with monotony, even if nothing bad is really happening in my life, then it’s time to stir things up. Maybe it’s time to get uncomfortable and make a big decision that will provide some new perspective and scenery. 

Take the time to lurk, learn and fail. But once you've got yourself a steady foothold on whatever it is you’re working for, then take things in your own hands and pave the way. Life’s journeys take a lifetime, so if you find yourself frustrated with contentment, then take a leap into the unknown. Achieving excellence doesn't mean you have to win any medals or set yourself apart from the rest of humanity. It’s far more productive to compare yourself with your past versions, rather than with versions of others who may have been fortunate. 

Achieving excellence should be completely introspective, with goals and standards set by your own progressive expectations.

(Xpost),Aristartle,9,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1acpgf/come_join_rsfc_if_you_are_looking_for_a_group_of/,"Hello there!

I recently indicated I was a Beachbody Coach that specialized in P90x. After getting many PMs asking for advice, I realized there are a ton of people that are trying to figure out how to start the program and stick with it so that they are in better shape and better health come summer time.

I decided to create a new subreddit, /r/sfc[1] , not to replace this one, but to act as a supplement to it. Its goal is to get everyone that joins in better shape come summertime. Its going to function a lot like the 'Beachbody Challenge,' which is free but normally run through Facebook. I would like to get a lot of fellow p90xers to join and work through the program with my girlfriend and I, so that we can give direct advice to these people.

However, I have decided to include people outside just p90x as my father has also expressed interest in joining some type of fitness challenge, but he is far to heavy and out of shape to dive into p90x. This is why we will also be including advice, workouts, and ideas for people that are just diving in to better health. These will be thing like push-up challenges that are catered to each individual and focusing on increasing how many they can do in a month, etc...

I will be there to provide support, but this is about creating a community directly related to getting everyone in better shape by summer. It doesn't matter where you are at, just that you keep progressing. I'm already in great shape, but I'm going to be pushing myself to new levels. My dad is in terrible shape, and is looking to lose weight and get to a point where he can start feeling better. There is something for everyone!

Since I was a kid I was able to make money online and eventually started my own company. I never really had to work 9-5 nor did I ever have a boss. I never had to wake up to go to work. My whole life I've been waking up whenever the fuck I wanted to and worked as much as I felt like. Usually a few hours per week. If I was to actually work 8 hours per day every day I would have been a millionaire by now. Instead I just comfortable make enough cash for me to live my life of a chronic procrastinator.

I've always been fascinated by motivation and tried to ditch my procrastination for many years now. I failed tons of times and I still can't stop procrastinating whenever I want but I did have a few victories too.

I used to smoke up to 40 cigarettes per day and after years of trying to quit I finally did it. It's been 4 years since I stopped this July.

I've also been chubby all my life. I was able to change my diet, quit eating sugar and start working out on regular basis. Yet again this took me years of trying and multiple failed attempts when I would relapse back into eating junk food after a few half assed attempts. I lost my belly and I'm now in the process of getting into my dream shape.

I always wanted to learn how to play piano but I would always give up after an hour of trying. After years of watching my piano gather dust I was recently able to learn my first full song.

There were a bunch of other similar mini victories. I seem to get bursts of sudden motivation that I can't really trigger at will even though I would have loved being able to.

I have however noticed something about the feeling I get moments prior to the motivational outburst that leads to successful completion of the task or change I was trying to accomplish.

I feel like I'm in some sort of state. My head feels foggy. I feel very calm and content. It almost feels like I'm meditating. My mind is clear and I'm not thinking about anything as if I just woke up from a dream and chilling in bed. I have a slight vision of the task that needs to be done but no emotions or visuals associated with doing or accomplishing the task. Just the thought of that task. Not even that. A representation of that thought in my mind. It almost feels like a little faded block of text at the back of my head: ""Must start redecorating the house"" for example. 

When I start doing the task I stay in the moment. I feel like I can't fail. I feel extremely calm and I don't have anything on my mind. I feel like I have reached the point of no return and only way is ahead now. I feel unstoppable. 

Here are a few things I've noticed.

1) I was never able to motivate myself to do anything when excited, stressed, annoyed, frustrated or angry.

2) I was never able to motivate myself by reading a clever motivational quote. Yes, you feel motivated when you read it but that's the end of it.

3) I was never able to motivate myself by scaring myself. Like thinking about how short life is or how if I keep on smoking I'll die from cancer etc.

4) I was never able to motivate myself by imagining my goals. For example if I have to make myself build a web page and I imagine how great and awesome a completed page would look like I would never get myself to actually start building it. If I imagine myself working on it and stop concentrating on the end result, sometimes something actually gets done.

Excuse my long rant type of post but I would really love to hear your success stories. What lead you to suddenly start doing something you failed at previously, wanted to do but never go to or something that you failed at before? How did you feel before, during and after that snapping point?

I would love to be able to force myself to go into that state at will. I would be fucking invincible.
