The basic principle is, If Manchester United win, We get to chose an image that you have to display on your sidebar, or the banner where the ''happy birthday roman'' image is now, obviously it has to be something that is to do with the football club, not just some random gore or something.

If chelsea wins the exact same things happens - you get to chose what our sidebar image is.

If it's a draw then no team has to do anything out of the ordinary.

My son was born early this week and I've got a pile of those baby Chelsea clothes ready for him to go. But he got here on his own terms about two weeks early and now he's  going in for the first of what appears to be several heart surgeries this week. I don't know where else to put this. I don't want anything. If this is against the rules, i sincerely apologize. I just need to share this stressful thing I'm going through with a community I feel apart of so I can keep it together and stay positive for my wife and my daughter, who are also having to deal with this. I love this football club, I love this subreddit. and I hope more than anything that I can sit down in October and show a healthy 6 month old boy what KTBFFH means.

Over the past few days it has become quite tedious to see every link mentioning Lampard posted and taken as gospel, regardless of their often wildly contradictory contents. I shan't be discussing the probability of Lampard (or Terry/Cole for that matter) being re-signed to a new deal. As many of you know I am privy to more information than most but there is no need to be a 'Chatty Cathy', I'd like to think that I've never steered you wrong though

On to business, let us begin with Frank Lampard. I wrote a detailed response the other day to a thread in /r/soccer [(found here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/15wtov/frank_lampards_agent_confirms_summer_exit_from/c7qka5b) regarding the situation as it stands. I get the impression many of you aren't totally familiar with the history behind this current impasse. We should begin roughly 4 years ago, as Jose Mourinho took charge at Inter Milan. At this stage, Lampard was at his peak and was continuing to set the example by which other midfielders were measured. His salary at the time was generous even relatively speaking but he wanted more. Through a series of media rumblings, 'quotes' and vague allusions made by both Frank and his agent, Steve Kutner, it became obvious that he was holding the threat of a move to Inter Milan over the head of the club. This situation resolved itself by a bumper deal for Frank taking his salary to £150k a week and the top of the Chelsea pay scale. Frank also lead the anti-AVB theatrics that plagued his reign. Whether one agrees or disagrees with AVB's methods, he was shown a complete lack of respect by Lampard and others which made his position untenable. A small detail for most fans but a terminal error in the eyes of the hierarchy of the club. Twice now he has essentially held the club to ransom, once to increase his salary and the other time to guarantee his standing at the club. These transgressions have not been forgotten, or forgiven and are seen as a dangerous symptom of the oft-mentioned player power that has been present at the club since Abramovich took charge. Unless something extraordinary comes to pass, the stance of the club is to no longer indulge the whims of the players, regardless of reputation or past glories. This is to say nothing of Frank's demands (I can't believe people took the £100k pay cut nonsense as truth) or the club's future plans with regards to a pay structure. Locking up £15m over two years on a 35 year old midfielder is terrible business, and before anyone cites Ryan Giggs or Paul Scholes do bear in mind that both of them took rolling deals at massively reduced pay to help out United when required, not start every game. They made their feelings clear and declared they would serve whatever role was needed until Fergie could do without them, respect is due for that

There is a lot more I could say about Lampard but I shall refrain. His agent and him have tried to work and angle and the club has basically called their bluff. If anything, it is the duo that is souring what is probably his last few months at the club, unlike Didier. I cite him as an example of the complete opposite, a man who served with unquestionable loyalty. I told you all here that he was leaving before it was announced, we had that discussion. However you should all know that had we not won the Champions League, he would have stayed on a rolling deal to 'do a Giggs/Scholes'. He left with everyone's blessings and reputation larger than ever, aided in no small part by the fairytale ending with his last kick of the ball for Chelsea. He knew when it could get no better and knowing when to walk away is an underrated aspect of a footballer's career and how we perceive it later on. All this negativity about the club is being fed to a voracious media from Frank's management and to be honest it leaves a sour taste in the mouth. The same media who slated us for having old players on big money are now demanding we give whatever it takes to keep a 35 year old until he's 37. Hypocrisy that should be admired for it's bravado

John Terry also pulled a 'Lampard' some time ago. He wanted a pay increase and threatened a move to City to get it, the same exact thing Wayne Rooney did. Now, he never came out and said he wanted to move but just like Rooney he kept silent and let the agents put the stories out there to pressurise his current club. He never went so far as putting in a transfer request but the intention was obvious. Again, the club relented and bowed to his demands but his card was marked. His situation has been dealt more blows after the Wayne Bridge/Vanessa Perroncal incident and the Anton Ferdinand case. He is now seen as a hinderance in terms of reputation to the club and is no longer untouchable as he was for so many years. He has another 18 months to go on his deal, do not expect him to be playing for Chelsea after that

Ashley Cole is the one that I disagree with (most), currently there is no replacement available in the marketplace nor is Ryan Bertrand anywhere close to his ability, attacking or defensively. I believe the issue here is down to length of contract and Ashley's desire to try his hand abroad. We can't do much about that, if Cole has said that he doesn't want a new deal then there is no point negotiating. I would love to see him stay though, more so than Lampard he is a crucial part of our team

I've waffled on long enough here, you can all believe whatever you wish, of course. This is the transition period that has been coming for some time, out go the ageing superstars on huge pay deals and in come younger, hungrier players on half the salary and who have resale value (Torres aside). Cole, Lampard and Terry earn a combined £450k roughly, over £20m a year in combined renumeration. The club feels the money could be better spent elsewhere while achieving a long standing aim of removing the power base of the players and allowing for a more stable management structure. I expect Benitez to oversee the dirty work as the fans dislike him anyway and he is due to leave in the Summer, a new manager can come in with almost a clean slate and shape the future

1375271098.0,187,self.chelseafc,1jeynh,Some thoughts on our ownership situation,EnglishMD,224,37,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1jeynh/some_thoughts_on_our_ownership_situation/,"This is not as long or as complete as I want it to be for a few reasons, nevertheless let us talk about some things I've noticed recently

It's great that people will vehemently defend Roman on r/soccer, especially in threads such as the one about Human Rights abuses in the UAE or after that Matthew Syed appearance on SSN. I have refrained from doing so, I did write a response here once which somebody linked to over there and it was then barraged with votes. What I write is for you guys, I could not care less what other fans think

My biggest issue with this website, and internet discussion in general, is that every viewpoint is given equal credence, as is every commenter bar the obvious troublemakers. This is simply ridiculous. Regarding Roman, I'm bored of seeing children comment on the thought processes and decision making of one of the richest, most successful men in the world. They have no idea as to how the real world works, let alone the rarified atmosphere of Billion Pound deals. I hate to be so blunt, but I'm sure most of you who have read my comments have figured out that I'm not exactly short of a few notes, yet I would never dare suggest that I understood the complexities of the moves that Roman and other such businessmen make, and I manage a very large company myself along with my Father who co-founded a company sold for several hundred million Pounds. It's difficult to explain the stupidity of comments that claim to understand what Roman is doing and why he purchased the club, why don't we get Kim Kardashian to teach Professor Hawking the finer points of theoretical astrophysics while we're at it, it would be equally informative and accurate

A lot of this stemmed from that Matthew Syed interview on SSN which is now held as some definitive moment in the public understanding of football ownership by less than Heavenly figures. Bollucks. It just shows how fucking clueless people are if they will happily regurgitate the claims of one man as fact. This argument is always conflated by the defenders in to ""Well he's right about the way Roman amassed his fortune"" as if that is valid justification. Everybody knows this, you could not make a fortune during the Cowboy Capitalism days of neonatal free-markets in the former USSR without being a combination of ruthless, quick, decisive and canny. It's such a vapid argument that because Syed correctly repeated this well-known fact, everything else he says must be true also. The idea that being an owner of a Football Club would protect you from the long hand of Putin is without basis too, yet it's now repeated by many as fact. The brazen way in which the Russian leadership deals with it's enemies means nobody is safe, anybody with any sort of background knowledge of the numerous incidents involving 'Russia's enemies' would laugh at the notion that owning Chelsea is protection

Which leads me to another issue. When did Roman become Putin's enemy? Apparently this is true, many people are saying so therefore it must be. Only it's completely wrong, Roman was lauded for his immense charitable efforts and the pumping of funds back in to Russia via Chukotka, the Russian Football team (he paid Hiddink's wages personally) and large sponsorships of Russian sports teams along with endowments to museums, art galleries and other artistic endeavours. When he wanted to resign from his post as Governor, Putin refused and demanded he stay, not only as a shining light to other Ogligarchs but because of the good he was doing. It's part of an approach that publicly shames those who have hoarded wealth and run away, while showering praise on those who are seen to be giving it back to the people. The fact that Roman still works in Russia is enough proof that he is not on unfriendly terms with Putin, if he were that would be the last place on Earth he would ever set foot

Anyway, I've rambled on long enough. My point is, don't bother arguing and wasting your time with people who haven't got a clue as to what they are vehemently arguing for. You won't win as the majority is against you and nobody cares about the facts you present as it isn't what they want to hear. All you should care about is that unlike some other Billionaire owners (Spurs, Villa, etc.) yours is a man who has lavished vast funds to make this club the force they are today, whose Son is being groomed to take the reins (when 'everybody' knew Roman would leave within a year or two of taking over) and who attends more games than almost any other owner I can think of. I'll let you in to a secret, nobody worth that much money has a clean history, it's just that some dark pasts are more well known than others",,False,self,t5_2rsl6,False,,,True,t3_1jeynh,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1jeynh/some_thoughts_on_our_ownership_situation/,

Let's hope this idiot is named and shamed and receives a lifetime ban from Stamford Bridge. People like this drag the rest of us rational, non-abusive fans down with him and I'm disgusted that he supports the same team that I do.

Last night's match was incredibly entertaining. We got the result we wanted and a slight measure of payback from what happened on Sunday. But the prick in the picture above has sullied it.

Name him, shame him, ban him. Anything else, and we risk cultivating an extremely bad reputation.

I am extremely proud of the successes and trophies that we were able to bring to the club in recent months.

Lifting Chelsea's first Champions League trophy, in Munich, was the best achievement in club history and without doubt the highlight of my career to date, both as a player and manager. It is a memory I will treasure for the rest of my life.

I have a deep and unreserved passion for Chelsea Football Club and I would like to sincerely thank all of the staff, my players and of course the Chelsea fans, for their tremendous and unconditioned support in the intense time I have been the manager at the Bridge. I wish all of them every success for the rest of the season and beyond.""

Our sub has grown massively since the last transfer window and because of that we're starting to see some of the issues that come along with that kind of growth. An increase of memes and also many duplicate posts.

Today alone has seen 3 submissions regarding Benitezs wink to Mourinhos return. [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1duvxg/rafa_benitez_hints_at_mourinho_return_during_a/), [here](http://redd.it/1duyfv) &amp; [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1dv2kv/skysportsrafael_benitez_hints_jose_mourinho_will/)

As well as several submissions concerning Andres Schurrles imminent arrival; [here](http://redd.it/1dvgr9), [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1dtsr3/bayer_chief_tips_schurrle_to_join_chelsea/) &amp; [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1ds4m9/rumour_roundup_the_dying_swan_edition/c9tnkuu)

In order to cut down on clutter I am proposing that the mods will delete duplicate posts, these will be rumour posts or articles basically containing the same sources rehashed several times. The article or link that is submitted first will stay up and any discussion around that point  should be made in that post.

We will continue not to delete Memes or image posts if they are relevant to Chelsea FC, if you don't like these posts, please down vote them and move on, some people here love them and some hate them,if you hate them you're just going to have to tolerate them I'm afraid..

Ok let me know what you think below and try not to hate too much, we're doing what we think is best, if you don't agree, please try to be constructive.

Perhaps I shoulkd ask Roman for a loan as he still seems to have plenty  of money to chuck around;

* According to the mirror Jose is planning a £90mil double swoop for both [**Cavani and Hulk**](http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/406124/Jose-Mourinho-plans-90m-double-swoop-for-Edinson-Cavani-and-Hulk?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+daily-express-football-news+%28Daily+Express+%3A%3A+Football+Feed%29) Just think for a moment what that might look like as we line up against Crystal Palace. It's fucking bonkers.

* Here's an article with little substance linking us to [**Wayne Rooney**](http://www.touchlinetalk.com/chelsea-set-to-bid-for-arsenal-target/53687/?) again, I would laugh so much if he did actually end up at Arsenal, he just seems to be the Anti-Wenger, I couldn't see them getting along for some reason. can someone photoshop them as the Odd Couple?

* In our search for a new Centre Back we have leapt ahead of Manchester United in the race to buy [**Eliaquim Mangala**](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/chelsea-transfer-news-portos-eliaquim-1940789?) as David Moyes is sitting on Blackpool beach wearing a kiss-me-quick hat and trying not to get Mr Whippy down his new Manchester United shirt.

* Here's another rumour that doesn't want to die a horrible death, like maybe being trapped inside an elevator with Luiz Suarez and Javier Mascherano, sorry i digress... [**Xabi Alonso**](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/chelsea/10108338/Jose-Mourinho-to-target-Xabi-Alonso-as-he-starts-to-rebuild-the-Chelsea-attack.html) is a transfer target for us. This article also contains a little dig made at Chelsea by  Barcelona's **Xavi** the rest of it appears to have been made up by a bored intern.

* Did you see Arsenal have submitted a bid for [**Felliani?**](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/319413/?) well if they want him, we HAVE to bid in order to artificially raise the price and make them spend all their transfer budget on the useful Belgium destroyer. making [**Arsene**](http://www.ronaldo7.net/news/2012/cristiano-ronaldo-562-arsene-wenger-crying-after-losing-a-game-for-arsenal.jpg) cry in the process.

* his some really bad news for all us Chelsea fans, Lyon won't let [**Befetimbi Gomis**](http://www.london24.com/sport/chelsea/alleged_chelsea_liverpool_and_cardiff_target_may_leave_as_club_look_to_avoid_free_transfer_1_2228369) leave on a free, looks like we'll have to battle Cardiff all the way down the line for his signature, the Welsh are frightening negotiators too, ask any leek salesman.

* Ok so with all these amazing players coming in who's leaving? First up utility Striker [**Demba Ba**](http://metro.co.uk/2013/06/09/demba-ba-facing-chelsea-exit-as-new-boss-jose-mourinho-sets-out-transfer-plans-3833734/?) we're gonna try and dump him on the Emirates Lawn and drive off really fast in JT's bentley.

* Also on his way out is [**Victor Moses**](http://myevertonnews.com/everton-eye-10m-bid-for-chelsea-starlet-victor-moses/) who could be heading to Everton, which is about right for him and his errant crosses.

* Contary to reports elsewher the Sun has [**Captain, Leader legend, JT**](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4960215/John-Terry-eyes-new-3-year-Chelsea-deal-under-Jose-Mourinho.html) looking for a whopping 3 year contract with the club. i really fucking hope this happens, we need to keep JT at the club whatever role he is playing, he is the lifeblood and although he's a twat sometimes, he's an example to all the new kids who come to the club with his love of all things Chelsea.

This is not meant to be an exhaustive analysis by any means and please feel free to add any relevant information/thoughts/questions.

----------------------------------

[Marco van Ginkel](http://www.transfermarkt.com/en/marco-van-ginkel/leistungsdaten/spieler_147034_2012.html)
------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------


* **Age:** 20

* **Position**: CM

* **Nationality:** Netherlands

--------------------------------------------------

**Stats**

--------------------------------------------------------------
* **Appearances:** 33 (Eredivisie)

* **Goals**: 8

* **Assists:** 10*

* **MPG**: 369 (2954 minutes played)

---------------------------------------------------
**Play Style**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


**van Ginkel** shows to be a tidy midfielder who can tackle when needed. His reading of the game is excellent [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P_Il6Gximnw#t=24s). 

His passing is excellent and is often compared to Lampards' [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P_Il6Gximnw#t=50s).

 He often likes to pick out a long cross-field ball [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P_Il6Gximnw#t=88s) but is able to play shorter, more clinical passes as well and does so frequently [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P_Il6Gximnw#t=14s) [[Example 2--nice through ball, not short though]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nC5EiYa2GmQ#t=42s).

He definitely has an eye for goal and shoots fairly often for a CM, with a decent range on his shot [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=P_Il6Gximnw#t=66s) [[Example 2]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nC5EiYa2GmQ#t=6s). 

He likes to make driving runs from deep in the opponents half and often dribbles multiple players neatly [[Example]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nC5EiYa2GmQ#t=19s)[[Example 2]](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=nC5EiYa2GmQ#t=77s). 

He is very quick and uses his speed to beat players seemingly casually, but hustles to get back and defend--he rarely gets caught out of position due to attacking runs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Potential**

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think with our current lack of options in CM, van Ginkel could be phased in to the first team this season as a backup. It's hard to say how much playing time he will get in our first team, but I believe he could get a couple starts in cup games and eventually Prem games if he transitions well. I think he has immense potential and am excited to see how he continues to develop.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Not sure if amount of assists is reliable. Please correct me if that's wrong.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


I just realized its rather late here, so I'll end it there. Hopefully this was helpful to someone.

1362078057.0,103,self.chelseafc,19eta4,I'm shocked and a little disgusted at some of the stuff I've been seeing here recently.,loveandmoney,178,75,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/19eta4/im_shocked_and_a_little_disgusted_at_some_of_the/,"OK, got something to get off my chest. Frankly, I can't believe the amount of sympathy I've seen Benitez getting here. r/soccer maybe, and even then mostly Liverpool fans winding us up, but in our own ranks? I just can't believe it.


Mass sympathy and upvotes for comments which suggest that last nights 'rant' was somehow justified. People seem to actually believe that Benitez is the victim in all of this. Does no one realise that he accepted the role of **interim** manager, it wasn't added to the contract, he wasn't made to sign it, he has no right to complain about being given that title. As I said in another thread, there is no other 'top' manager (a category Benitez bizarrely finds himself in) that would accept such a demeaning title.


As early as the replay against Birmingham in the FA Cup last season when he was first linked with the job, there was mass dissent in the Chelsea section, banners and songs imploring the board not to give Benitez the job (""Fuck off Benitez, you're not wanted here""). Benitez was interviewed around that time, and flirted with the role despite the interviewer informing him of the crowds dislike; he laughed it off and then made the appropriate maneuvers and agent whisperings to be right there and ready to succeed Roberto Di Mateo less than a day after his dismissal.


Benitez knew full well he would be unpopular with the crowd, but through a mixture of greed, hubris, opportunism and disbelief that he could land another top European manager job after what happened at Inter Milan, he took it anyway. Upon his arrival he stated that he would 'win over' the Chelsea fans with results, that clearly didn't happen, the results didn't come and the dissent grew louder. I accept that football fans are fickle and that if he inspired us to something resembling a title challenge and had a coherent strategy then the crowd would be much more placid. But to then blame the fans negativity is the ultimate scandal and embarrassment to cover the fact that he has failed again, he couldn't get the results that were supposed to 'win us over', so it somehow became our fault not his; even though he knew what he was walking into.


Hopefully this has explained why I find it absolutely crazy how much support he is getting around here. Chelsea fans get stick for being 'plastic' and 'glory hunting', but on this occasion we stuck to our guns, we didn't want him before, and we don't want him now. Outsiders say we are stupid and harsh to berate our own manager, but if we had sucked up to him in the vein hope of him bringing us success, then IMO that is the truly plastic attitude; some of us at Chelsea still have some loyalty.


My final point is that of course Benitez is a massive distraction for a completely dysfunctionally run football club. Sacking Di Matteo was a disgrace, and whilst it is to support the legend himself, the singing of his name at Chelsea since his departure is actually the closest thing we have done to sticking the finger up at Roman and saying we don't want him running our club so recklessly. 


There is a big overlap in all that I have read online today between the actions of Abramovich and the actions of the fans. Somehow Abramovich's trigger finger has been linked to the fans as well, but we never called for the head of any of our managers until now. I am stunned that when we finally have a reason to get rid of one, some 'fans' around here blame other supporters with some bullshit about a 'negative atmosphere'. 


There are two main culprits situation as it stands. I am not prepared to consider life without Roman yet, but don't let the other one off by sympathising with the ridiculous things he said yesterday.

As an American I wasn't really exposed to much Soccer Growing up. I grew up in a very tight neighborhood in San Jose California, typical middle class white suburb tbh. We had a British family living down the street and the husband (his name was Andy) and my dad were bro's, they went bike riding daily and drank beer together all the time they were at alot of our holiday parties and what not. When I was in my junior year of highschool he passed away and his entire funeral was Chelsea themed. Everyone in attendance wore the blue in the form of a pin in tribute to the mans rabid devotion to the team of his youth. He was a real inspirational figure growing up he was there for a lot of benchmarks including giving me my first beer with the permission of my dad of course. I spoke at his funeral and I remember seeing the sea of blue ribbons of all the people who had come to honor him. Ever since then Chelsea has been my team and I'm fiercly attached to the club. Every time I watch them raise the silverware I cant help but imagine the old guy in heaven raising his glass to his team and it brings a smile to my face.

TL;DR
Andy D. You were an inspiration to me. Thanks for sharing your Love of the Blues with a young American kid and I hope your up there somewhere enjoying the success of the last few years. Cheers mate!

Hey guys. 

The off season is shit and the way we can counter that is by broadcasting Chelsea matches and watching them together as a sub especially the great moments in our history. We do this on /r/Formula1 as well as the time between races is very long so we have 1 person streaming a couple of races and in the comments those who are watching the stream comment.

We can include all the classics which many of you might not have seen until now and also our recent matches which were good. 

This will help pass the time until the season and it will also help us revisit those memories.

Here is what I can provide :

- 1) A full streaming guide to anyone who has the upload bandwidth necessary (which isn't even that great to be honest).

- 2) Full detail to how to stream both for the sub and the broadcaster, little to no computer knowledge needed. If you can browse this subreddit you can stream a match.

- 3) Pretty much any big match from our history. I mod /r/FootballDownload and can provide pretty much any match necessary.

- 4) A list of matches both past and present to watch. I can make up a great list since I've been watching Chelsea for a long long time.

My only limitation is the upload speed. I do a lot of torrent work which is why my upload speed is always occupied. This means my streams will be low quality and choppy. Most of you can easily stream it with your bandwidth and the streams will be available on laptops, tablets, iPhones and Androids as well without any problem. 

Nevertheless I will try to do some demo streams from my end to see if my Internet can hold up. I have all the download speed necessary but I doubt the available part of my upload speed can support it adequately.

Anyway I know for sure we will get this system up and running and we can enjoy the off season. Leave your questions below and I'll answer them and also if you are interested.

1340526188.0,96,self.chelseafc,viooo,Something I'd like to say about Drogba,headmotownrepper,108,12,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/viooo/something_id_like_to_say_about_drogba/,"When I was eight years old, my father landed tickets to a Chelsea FC match here in the States. As you guys know, big teams sometimes tour foreign areas in the summers. In this case, Chelsea was coming to play a friendly in my somewhat local area. I was going to see the first professional football match of my life.

At this point in my life, my father and I weren't close. We rarely interacted, and when we did we were usually yelling at each other. We never got along and mostly just stayed out of each others' ways. But a lot changed after this game.

Long story short, I fell in love with Chelsea FC. I can't even remember the team they played that day. But the way THEY played, the way they looked, they way they carried themselves. It was beautiful. I'm sure some on this subreddit can relate. I subsequently became an avid Chelsea fan.

Pretty soon, I forced my father to get Dish so I could watch my Chelsea matches. At first, I would just watch the games on my own, but after a little while (coincidentally around the time Chelsea acquired Drogba) my father became bored of crime dramas and started watching the games with me. And guess what?

He fell in love too. We began to watch so many games (in the past I'd skip some games if I wanted to sleep in or something but no longer) that it became a tradition to wake up early every Saturday morning to watch our Chelsea FC take the field.

A couple years later, Drogba had his first golden boot year (06/07). At this point, we began watching many soccer games, not just those in which Chelsea participated in. But it was always much more exciting to watch Chelsea games. Primarily of course because of our love for the team, but there was something else. Someone, one player, made them much more unique. Didier Drogba. He was such a...different...player. He was someone I always thought could play any position but was simply divine as a striker.

His playing style was so unique. His seemingly infinite strength, taking on numerous defenders and occupying an entire back four on his own. Whole teams would have to readjust their defense tactics simply because of Drogba. And of course, he's a man that lives for the big games. Cometh the hour, cometh the man, and no one embodies this more than Drogba. Just check out his goals:appearances ratio in cup finals. I think it was about 1:1? Absolutely insane.

He is also a unique person. He is one who not only gives back to the community but goes above and beyond the call of duty. For starters, he brought peace to his home country of Côte d'Ivoire. More recently, he donated all $3million of his Pepsi endorsement to building a hospital there as well.

My father and I were huge Chelsea fans. But we also became huge Drogba fans.

And as we progressed through the years, we lived through the best and the worst together. The first title win in 04/05 (sorry to go back in time for a second but I can't leave that out of course!), the cup double in 06/07, the night in Moscow which we will never speak of again, the league/cup double in 10/11.

And as we lived through the best and worst of the club, we did with Drogba as well. Ecstasy when capturing his first golden boot, the anger, frustration, desperation, and sadness of Moscow, ecstasy again with the second damned golden boot!

The important thing is that we lived through these emotional experiences together. This was completely foreign to us. But Chelsea, and Drogba, brought us so much closer. And we both became better people because of it.

Then this year happened.

It was a year of ups and downs. For my father and I, we mostly only lived the downs. Before any of the real positives of the season had manifested, my father lost his long battle with cancer (May 9th 2:20 pm).

We had grown very close. I know that he would have loved to have seen the FA Cup victory, which only happened a few days after he passed. But even more so, especially after that night in Moscow, I know that he would have given anything to have seen Chelsea with the champions league. ESPECIALLY in the manner they did. Specifically, doing it as underdogs and with Drogba dominating.

In any case, I just wanted to say that although Drogba's generosity physically helped many in Africa, he touched many others. He was one of the major driving forces in me becoming close with my father. And even though it was only for a few years, they were without a doubt the best years of my life.

So Drogba. I will miss you. Watching Chelsea won't be the same with you anymore. But I'll always support you in whatever you do, and you'll always be my favorite player, past, present, or future.

Thank you.",,False,self,t5_2rsl6,False,,,True,t3_viooo,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/viooo/something_id_like_to_say_about_drogba/,

""Arsenal had the same manager and it is a long time since they won something. You can’t always say that is the fault of the manager or the players. Maybe if you asked them if they would rather have 10 managers and six trophies, I don’t know what they would say.""

Make a match thread if everyone wants to mash their keyboards and abuse the shift button each time we score or a great play happens. Or just keep it to one thread. Or go to /r/soccer, cause everyone does it in match threads there. I'm excited as fuck too, but these threads are just clutter imo. 

They also hide any solid discussion threads that arise during or after the match.

Just my 2 cents. Don't want to put a damper on a great win, but I figured I'd share anyway.

As I am kinda bored at home due to graduating school and havent got a job for the summer my plan was to bring a similar discussion over to /r/ChelseaFC aswell. I know i am not the best a formatting but I hope we can get some good discussion going during the pre-season. To start things off i went with our new golden boy.

**Points of discussion**

1. After his first season at Chelsea how do you feel has lived up to his **hype** coming into the season

2. **13 Goals and 20 Assists** do you think he can beat it, and maybe has he said himself get closer to the tallies that Messi and C.Ronaldo is showing?

3. As many of us has discussed over the season do you think he will stay at chelsea for a long time or try to move onto, perhaps Spain and **Real Madrid/Barcelona** in a few years?

4. Many people claims that Eden has the **potential** to become a Ballon d'or winner in the future. How far do you guys think he can go?

Well Mr.Paul left the world on 26th October 2010..or did he?

I ran some famous names through the worlds most sophisticated algorithms until I discovered that Paul was still alive in this world.

Narrowed the search down to two names. My conclusion was that it was either Ron Paul or OctaChaz being used as a dummy by Paul's mystical powers.

After visiting /r/circlejerk it dawned on me that Paul could not possibly be Ron Paul. Why would he change his main objective and run for the president of USA? He could have done that after the world cup but did he?

That just leaves one person behind who is..yup you've guess it **dramatic music** OCTACHAZ. **OCTO**pus **OCTA**chaz coincidence? Take a look at this!

**Octachaz | Octopus|** 

Name starts with ""OCT"" | Name starts with ""OCT""

Can predict the winner | Can predict the winner

Football related powers | Football related powers

Powers stored in Jersey | Powers stored in water tank

Hates Liverpool | Hates Liverpool

Reddit account created after Paul 'died' | 'Died' before OctaChaz account was created 

Chelsea fan | Never showed support for a club as he had world wide fans

My conclusion is that OctoPus was a Chelsea fan but his fan base would have flipped if this truth were to surface. So he 'died' and alas OctaChaz joins /r/ChelseaFC and becomes a sudden mystical being.

What is the truth? You decide.

1359917414.0,83,self.chelseafc,17tggz,Let's debate then.,Ruwn,97,14,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/17tggz/lets_debate_then/,"I do appreciate being downvoted into oblivion for prompting a response. I can't fight war of attrition, I have too many hospital shifts these two weeks. But I will make a case that it's not nearly as bad as it's been painted. There is a logic at Chelsea you can't ignore.

&gt; When the board recognised that we were severely lacking depth (especially in midfield - remembering that we lost Ballack, Deco, Belletti and Joe Cole that summer) they responded by spending £75m on Fernando Torres and David Luiz in January. 

The January transfer window had nothing to do with midfield (obvious as the players you listed aren’t midfielders). That transfer window was in response to the first of the lately normal winter slumps that Chelsea has. You can’t honestly believe the board thought to respond to a midfield problem with a striker and defender…  We all know Torres was RA’s thing, but Luiz wasn’t nonsensical at all. Ivanovic likes to play in the center, but he’d been doing well at right back that season and was preferred there over unibrow and Ferreira. To make matters worse, Alex was getting injured and Terry was injured earlier in the season. Buying a new CB was increasing depth in the squad in the back, which you say they weren’t worried about. You can’t just gloss over that to make your point.
&gt;So in 2010-11, what's the verdict on the squad building? On replenishing the squad with valued contributors in all areas? Remembering that we largely played 4-3-3 at the time, our out and out midfield options at the time were Ramires, Lampard, Essien and Obi. Zhirkov and Malouda did jobs at various times. That's it.

I can’t say we only had 4 people in midfield and casually throw in Zhirkov and the amazing Malouda. Malouda had 15g/15a in 09/10 so one would expect him to be playing in 10/11 as well. Turns out he was extremely important in the Ancelotti diamond and netted the club 13 goals (more than even Drogba) in 10/11. Zhirkov wasn’t nearly as prolific, but he didn’t play some bit part either, appearing 21 times for Chelsea, 12 of those in the league. Those stats scream depth player. You’ve also ignored that we bought Yossi and McEachran started making league appearances (9 that season, 17 overall). We had Essien, Ramires (bought), Lampard, Mikel, Malouda, Zhirkov, Yossi (bought), McEachran (youth). 8 players. Is it a lot? No, but it’s not like it was butchered. I couldn’t agree that Joe Cole, Deco, and Beletti would have been the difference we needed. I love Ballack so I do wish we kept him. 
&gt;Why did this happen? This happened because of the organisational vacuum at the top of the club. This club is run at Roman Abramovich's discretion. When he wants someone, he does his level best to get them cf. Andrei Shevchenko; Fernando Torres. In lieu of decent planning and decision making, it was instead deemed prudent to spend £75m (of which £50m is definitely wasted, the other £25m, the jury is out on) on two players. What does this say about the organisation of the club to you?

You have a sample size of two, and those are no secret. You think Roman is stupid, and you’re of the impression that he treats Chelsea like a toy. We overpaid for Luiz simply because it was a January window, I don’t think that reflects his potential. I think he’s got what it takes to be a captain one day, and I’d rather we have players like him who love Chelsea down to their blood. What does this all tell me? It tells me we have an owner who brought Chelsea to the forefront of football and he has some desires that he’s carried through on, to perhaps the detriment of the club. You may disagree with the club’s board etc., but no one can deny they’ve gotten us amazing players over the years just as well. 
&gt;Here's the best bit - what happens to the men responsible for the dismal squad? Nothing really. Abramovich pet Emenalo is promoted to Director of Football

He got that position in July 2011. Prior to that he was scout and a coach, I don’t see why you’re blaming everything on him. Maybe the current situation could be pinned to him, but he’s not some longstanding issue. But I must ask, what exactly do you want to fire these folk for? Arnesen I did not like, so I agree he never should have been there. As much as we all would have liked Ancelotti, it’s not hard to see where the board were coming from. Ancelotti’s system just didn’t have long term potential, and with the board seeking a different style of play for Chelsea (something I have hated about by the way) following a poor display against United in the UCL he was let go. Keep in mind that’s not my appraisal, but how the board felt. At that moment, AVB was a great idea. We’ll never know the reason behind Wilkins’ sack, but I’m willing to wager the personal issue rumor was the right answer. 
&gt;It's 2011. Bright young thing, Andre Villas-Boas is the hottest property on the football manager market. But what has he really achieved? He's had a sensational season, but where is the detailed planning? Where is the analysis of what's he like as a person?

Seeing how he was already at Chelsea in the past, it’s not a stretch to imagine they figured out what he’s all about fairly quickly. Worked with JM and had a similar outlook with a style of football the board wanted to achieve at Chelsea, hard to not want as a good match.
&gt; Will he be hamstrung by a complete lack of organisation at the top? Will be be undermined by promising him the complete support of the board and the owner, yet not giving him the appropriate funds to build the squad in his image? Will he labour under the misapprehension that he has the owner's full support, alienate half the playing staff and then get sacked? Who knows, let's see.

You have got to be kidding me. Ok, instead of retrospective emotion let’s look at the facts shall we? We brought in Courtois, Romeu, Juan Mata (yay), Davila, Meireles (injury signing), and poor poor Lukaku. Davila had loan written all over him, but that’s 2 midfielders and an amazing raw young striker brought in. AVB idiotically ruined one year of Lukaku’s life, there is no defending that. Changes don’t happen overnight, but it was clear that the club was chaning the type of players it wanted to bring in. We still had a powerful squad on paper that may not have won the title, but was strong enough. 
&gt;Moving out over the summer, mainly lots of youth and ex-youth. Zhirkov the main one to go. You'll remember the midfield point I made before, at this time we played 4-3-3. When Michael Essien ruptured his ACL in August, our options were Ramires, Lampard and Mikel. Not to forget an extremely raw 19 year old Oriol Romeu (for whom you have to wonder why he was available at £3m from Barcelona) and Josh McEachran, who would eventually go out on loan. Essien's injury caused a last minute purchase of Raul Meireles. As you can see, the planning of this isn't great. Injuries do happen, but we're fairly light there anyway.

Let’s see, sold Zhirkov for a profit on a sub, hard to argue there. Essien got injured yet again, so we brought in Meireles for cover. I suppose they could have just assumed Essien would get injured, but Mikel and Ramires would be able to cover. At the end of the window, we had Romeu, Essien (injured), Ramires, Lamps, Mikel, Malouda, Meireles, and Mata. 7 (8 w/ Essien) midfielders for 3-4 slots. Barring severe injuries, it’s good enough. Yeah it didn’t have the same depth as City, but you can’t go buy a whole squad in one window. Of the 8, only 3 (Lamps, Essien, Malouda) are staunch oldies. 
&gt;As for the moving out of the old guard, this isn't done in the summer. That would make too much sense.

Moving out the old guard is bullshit. No one can convince me that we would have been better off without Cech, Terry, Lampard, and Drogba starting from last year. As an example, United don’t keep their senior players for no reason. Club legends foster development of the youth and, more importantly, put experience on the pitch. Getting rid of them in one summer would have been a death sentence to our season last year and for seasons to come. The newer players training with the old guard is invaluable. It makes no sense to have wanted them to move out in summer like some unwanted roommate.

If you had asked me back in February if I thought we would be make it to the Champions League final, I probably would have laughed at the suggestion. Our season up until that point had been terrible and I don't think anyone with footballing knowledge envisioned us getting this far. If we lose, we can take still solace in the knowledge that we have pulled off a lot of major upsets this year. At some points, it has been magical, as if some sort of invisible hand has been guiding us along the way. Make no doubt about it: This is a season that we will all remember for years to come, regardless of what happens tonight in Munich. It's as if somebody decided to write a thriller about football and used Chelsea as the lead actor. In the next few seasons, we might be more successful than we have been this year, but this particular season will still come out on top of our long list of memories that we like to look back fondly on.

* Back in February, when Napoli beat us 3-1, everyone assumed that our European campaign was over. Napoli had a blistering counter-attack and we were under-performing at the time. Milan had also thumped Arsenal 4-0, which led to snide comments about Serie A being superior to the Premier League. Suddenly, there was an excited interest among neutral fans at the prospect of seeing all of the English sides being knocked out so early. Then, the second leg came and we managed to [make a comeback](http://www.soccerclips.net/videos/chelsea-4-1-napoli-ivanovic1). Winning 4-1 on an unforgettable night, we overturned the deficit and knocked out the same team that had stumped Manchester City on two separate occasions. Some people were shell-shocked; especially the guys who thought that Napoli's counter-attack would rip right us apart. Suddenly, the screams of ""Forza Napoli!"" faded into silence and talk about the demise of the EPL teams in Europe was put on hold.

* For the quarter finals, we were matched up against Benfica. People instantly began to play on the fact that Benfica had forced Manchester United into two draws during the group stages and topped their group. When it was announced that it would be Benfica VS Chelsea in the quarter finals, one Benfica fan on Reddit wrote ""I'll take it!"", as if Chelsea were some sort of easy ticket to the semi-finals. One person stated: ""Benfica will be more happy with this tie than Chelsea!"" Anyway, the two legs were played out and we ended up [winning 3-1 on aggregate](http://www.soccerclips.net/videos/chelsea-2-1-benfica-meireles). Benfica's manager exhibited critical amounts of butthurt after the game and we were on our way to face Barcelona in the semis. 

* For the semi finals, it was Barcelona. Every man and his dog predicted that Barcelona would come out and whip us, especially after they saw our lackluster performance against Benfica at Stamford Bridge. Barcelona fans everywhere were full of confidence. Some of them stated that it would be an easy game and that they would probably win by a wide margin. That night, in the first leg at Stamford Bridge, we defended like gladiators and shocked everyone by [grabbing a goal from a quick counter attack](http://www.soccerclips.net/videos/chelsea-1-0-barcelona-drogba1). The game ended at 1-0, much to everyone's surprise. As soon as the game was over, the game at the Nou Camp started to loom over our heads and most people expressed their belief that we would still end up losing heavily in the end. People mentioned the pitch size and how Barca would have more space to pass. They brought up the fact that the Nou Camp is a fortress. Basically; the odds were stacked against us. When the away leg came and we let in 2 goals and John Terry had been sent off, nobody believed that we had a chance (myself included). The odds of us turning the game around at that particular moment were 220-1. However, out of nowhere, [Ramires brought us back into the game](http://www.soccerclips.net/videos/barcelona-2-1-chelsea-ramires) and defied logic. For the second half, we defended with all of our might and managed to keep Barca out. When Messi missed his penalty, the Nou Camp became nervous and the thought of Chelsea winning began to sneak into the back of people's minds. Then, the twist came. In the last minute of the game, [Torres rounded the keeper](http://www.soccerclips.net/videos/barcelona-2-2-chelsea-torres) and sent us all into euphoria. We had pushed our way pass Barcelona with 10 men, at the Nou Camp. You couldn't write this stuff.

So anyway; I'd just like to say that this season has been terrific and that I will remember it for years to come, regardless of what happens tonight. In the future, I can see myself thinking about that epic night at the Nou Camp and our comeback against Napoli at Stamford Bridge, where the old guard banded together with the new guard and overturned all of the odds. This season can only end up getting better, not worse. And hey, at least after this game, we all get to have some sort of mental rest from the dramatic highs and lows that this season has cast upon us.

Carefree, guys!

Anyway, snapped these photos with ""Stamford"" and ""Bridget"" that I thought might be worth sharing, and I figured I'd pass along some things I noted about your players.

[My brother stole a cheeky kiss.](http://i.imgur.com/fc5qcHE.jpg)

[I told Stamford that Abramovich was going to drop big money on Gunnersaurus, but he didn't respond.](http://i.imgur.com/A4qmhrp.jpg)

Anyway, some player insights:

Hazard is incredible at dribbling. Obviously you all know this. I was lucky enough to be perched near a corner flag and was treated to a great view. In person, he is simply stunning. 

Ramires and Oscar both look like children. It's shocking how small they are. Especially since they were warming up next to Jamal Blackman

Speaking of which, you have a special keeper in that kid. He was immense during warm-ups, and his save against Osvaldo was incredible to see in person. I'll be very curious to see where he ends up. Not to mention the fact that he gargantuan. 

Demba Ba looks a little lack luster, but performances aside he was hilarious to watch. Most players seemed intense and focused, but he came out of the locker room with a big grin on his face. Take that as you will. I have to admit, it was a treat to see someone enjoying being out on the pitch that much. It looked like how I imagine I would look if I suddenly had time on the pitch.

Unfortunately I had a very low angle, so viewing midfield movement was difficult. I was very impressed with Moses' tracking back and thought he played well overall. I continue to be fascinated with John Obi Mikel, as he seems to be one of the most disciplined midfielders in the league. His composure was fantastic and his horizontal movement was like clockwork. He did a great job of harrying Bradley.

Lampard was... well, quintessential Lampard. He hit two terrific shots: one that forced a great save and another that was an impressive goal. It felt great to see him do that in person, even as a neutral.

In defense, you guys seemed a little porous down the right. Osvaldo was getting a lot of opportunities out on that flank and having too much time to cut inward. It seemed like Azpilicueta was getting caught up high a bit. Moses in the first half had a terrific covering tackle for him.

And to end on a sour note... Torres looks like a broken man off the pitch. It breaks my heart. I wanted to make a sign that said ""Fernando I'm over it, call us back - YNWA"" but I ran out of time.

Anyway, I don't know how interesting this will be to ya Blues, but I always lust after first hand stories from people that see LFC players. Ask me questions if you want and I'll answer if I know.",,False,self,t5_2rsl6,False,,,True,t3_1k4qbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1k4qbv/i_met_stamford_and_bridget_at_the_match_against/,

* First up [Falcao](http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/4742082/Falcaos-French-fancy.html) would rather go to Paris, France than London, England. What a prick. I don't think I'd want him now even if this report turned out to be unfounded rubbish... 

* [Lukaku](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2261823/Romelu-Lukaku-wants-stay-West-Brom.html) is having so much fun at WBA he would like to stay another year, he's only 19 you know. Must love a Balti.

* The daily Star have us all but signed [Iago Aspas](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/292887/Spanish-goal-ace-Iago-Aspas-heading-to-Chelsea/) the celta Vigo striker I mentioned last week. £8.5m for Michu 2.0 (I hope).

* This one is in French but basically it states that we will bid for [Mbia](http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Mbia-vers-chelsea/342183#xtor=RSS-1) if QPR get M'Villa. not sure about this one though...

* [Kalou](http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/292929/QPR-boss-Harry-Redknapp-eyes-ex-Chelsea-star-Salomon-Kalou-and-Swansea-s-Danny-Graham/) maybe going back to West london to play for... QPR. I thought he left on rather good terms as well.

* [Guardiola](http://www.givemefootball.com/324638-german-giants-beat-chelsea-manchester-united-to-first-guardiola-move) news just in, the German Giants Bayern Munich have apparently made the first move in trying to tie down Guardiola, they may not have the financial might of Chelsea or City, but could the footballing aesthetic and club set-up be more appealing to the in demand Spainard?

* [Willian](http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/chelsea-and-spurs-target-willian-runs-into-trouble-at-shakhtar-8450921.html) who some papers are still claiming is a target for Chelsea, just because our name sells more papers than Spuds, has not returned to training, because he's a big sulky, unprofessional baby. Should fit in well in North London then.

* and finally a Geordie car washer (or something) is pissed off because [Demba Ba](http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/newcastle-car-cleaner-fuming-after-1534131) still owes him £40 or something. Do one son, he's dawn sath naw.

I'm a Nigerian football fan of Chelsea FC. I normally only read on reddit but yesterday something grabbed my attention and I had to react. There was a discussion on my fellow Nigerian Kenneth Omeruo that has apparently started the popular opinion that we should look at Kenneth to strenghten our defense next year.

I do not know who started this, but I try to follow as much Nigerians as I can in Europe, and I can promise you this: If Kenneth Omeruo ever becomes a starting Chelsea defender I will eat my own shoes and post pictures as prove, you can all save this post.

This guy failed testing at 8 different clubs before joining Standard De Liege. His only good side is that he's one big pile of muscle (extremely strong and pacey). He cannot control a ball, nor pass it and has no technique. My felllow Nigerians and I wonder every day how he has made it, not only as a professional football player, but to our national team and to a club like Chelsea.

* [Big Ron](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2180762/Ron-Gourlay-says-Chelsea-spending-over.html) says the spending isn't over, we can strengthen in 2 more positions but only for the right price, but which two positions should they be? let's have a look...

* First up right back and Chelsea have been told to up their offer for [Cesar Azpilicueta](http://www.clubcall.com/chelsea/blues-told-to-up-defender-offer-1450011.html) to nearer £8mil, still a bargain? 

* [Hulk](http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/34044_hulk_hails__huge_achievement__of_chelsea_link.html) is still making huge come get me eyes, saying being linked with Chelsea is ""A huge achievement"" This quote however is from June, so things have changed since then.

* in other forward news [Cavani](http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2012/07/27/3269516/cavani-i-wont-leave-napoli-but-i-would-like-to-play-in-the?source=breakingnews) Will not leave Napoli, dashing hopes of signing him this summer. I'm sure if Roman digs deep enough he would change his mind.

* [Willian](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/9424561/Tottenham-Hotspur-make-Willian-and-Moussa-Dembele-inquiries-as-Luka-Modric-move-to-Madrid-edges-closer.html) has been left frustrated by Chelseas rejected offer, but AVB may be jumping to the rescue according to the Daily Mail.

* [Lukaku](http://www.sportinglife.com/football/news/article/165/7956753/lukaku-eyes-prem-loan-move) has been quoted as pushing for a premiership loan move, surely if he goes somewhere we must sign another forward...

* [Schurrle](http://sportwitness.ning.com/forum/topics/disgruntled-andre-schurrle-keeps-thinking-about-chelsea-move-as-c) is another player left frustrated by his club not selling him to our club, apparently like a jilted lover , he can't stop thinking about Chelsea, hit the Gym and get off facebook mate!

* [Kakutas](http://www.insidefutbol.com/2012/08/01/flattered-by-marseille-talk-but-nothing-official-to-report-gael-kakuta/66303/) proposed move to Marseille is on Ice at the moment. The French love to keep you waiting...

* [Neymar](http://www.express.co.uk/football/view/336758/Barcelona-close-in-on-Chelsea-target-Neymar) is apparently still a target for for Chelsea but Barcelona will beat us to the punch, check out who they state is our manager in the article though... Quality rehash journalism right there, proof it you wankers!

* and finally Premiership funny man [Arsene Wenger](http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1280454-arsenal-transfer-news-arsene-wenger-slams-chelsea-and-manchester-city) has poured his annual scorn on any club that can spend more money than his. What's the matter Arsene? Jelly are we?

My dad has been a Chelsea supporter for 40 odd years. While I personally was born in Canada, my love for Chelsea goes far deeper than most over here. It was never a choice for me, and the bond between me, the club and my dad is a huge part of my life. 

I love hearing all his stories of supporting Chelsea through the 70's and 80's. One of his favourites is about when he went with about 1,000 travelling Chelsea fans to United. In his words, ""we scored three minutes in, and then sat in our penalty area for the rest of the game. Ended 1-0. We had double our number of police escort us back to the train station, and it was nowhere near enough.""

Whenever we are in a tight spot, having problems, or crash out of a competition, it is another story I think about. The day Chelsea got relegated to the third division coincided with my uncles wedding. My dad remembers running in and out of the ceremony, checking on the results. We ended up losing 1-0 to QPR, and were relegated. Later that night, he's sat around, absolutely dejected. One of the waitresses comes up to him, slips him her number, and says she's staying in the hotel across the street after the reception.

he told her to fuck off.

anyway, KTBFFH. Our problems today are nothing like they used to be. In my dad's own words- ""you have to remember that for a long time, we were crap.

    * Of his 13 goals this season, this is one of the best. Schurrle nestles a neat, well-timed volley beyond Benfica goalkeeper Artur, although it wasn't enough to inspire Leverkusen to victory.

* #4) [Hoffenheim 0-1 Bayer Leverkusen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=pLK8z4SHzE4)

    * Perhaps the best thing about this goal is that Schurrle is running at pace when he collects the ball, and in one swift movement, bends it into the far corner.

* #3) [Germany 2-0 Uruguay](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=85m8BSFVHms)

    * Schurrle shows exactly why he shouldn't be give too much space, as he expertly places the ball beyond the outstretched hand of Uruguay's Fernando Muslera during this international fixture.

* #2) [FC Augsburg 1-3 Bayer Leverkusen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=kz6g43t7rm0)

     * A rare strike with his left foot, this goal epitomises exactly what Andre Schurrle is all about. Picking the ball up just inside the opposition half, he powers his way past three defenders, before rifling a shot into the bottom corner with his left peg.


* #1) [Bayer Leverkusen 2-2 Borussia Moenchengladbach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=L_kCzMMw1bA)

   * A classic Andre Schurrle goal. He picks the ball up on the left wing and drifts in on his favoured right foot before lashing an unstoppable strike into the far corner.

Can i just remind everyone to try and follow [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) when voting on posts and comments.

The [Edison Cavani thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1h00ky/rumour_chelsea_58m_cavani_deal/) this morning for instance has split opinion. Please don't downvote someone for having a differing opinion to yourself. The reasons for this are many but a couple of the biggies are;

* If you down vote someone for their opinion, they may be discouraged from commenting again, this would obviously be a shame, the more commentors we have in discussions the better they are.

* The quality of the the discussions will drop, do you really want everyone on the sub to have the same opinion? If we all agreed on everything it would make this place very dull.

* It's just not sporting!

If someone has posted a comment you think is incorrect, comment back but to backup your argument give them some evidence of your opinion, please don't just attack them personally, some people don't have your encyclopaedic knowledge of Hazards pass completion record when he was 15!

If someone is being rude or not adding to the discussion in a constructive way, then down vote them as much as you like! (It may be nice to point out the error of their ways as well).

As always your comments are welcome on this subject, try to keep them positive, as we grow as a community we want to try and keep the quality and community that our sub is known for.

TL;DR; Vote based on quality not opinion. **KTBFFH**",,False,self,t5_2rsl6,False,,present,True,t3_1h13h8,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/1h13h8/reddiquette_reminder/,moderator

1359825139.0,62,self.chelseafc,17rcoh,QUESTION: Is it Rafa or are the player's not good enough? Let us know. ,cech_mate,85,23,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/17rcoh/question_is_it_rafa_or_are_the_players_not_good/,"I happen to think the squad is not good enough. Look at United and City and compare their squad to ours. as a long time chelsea fan i've seen too many players been used as a scapegoat. Anelka, Kalou, AVB (manager), Torres, Mikel, now Rafa (manager). The problem is we are lacking in depth at every position. and lacking consistency. We are not good enough we rely on Juan Mata for goals and assists. half the time our players dont track back leaving the 4 defenders crowded against opposition players. When was the last time during the Roman era you remember chelsea being label a one man team. It pathetic when you have to come from the back against Brentford to scarp for a 2-2 tie. and everyone first reaction is blame Rafa, If that was United every single player would have been criticizes but since we dont like Rafa we blame him. Reading we blew a 2-0 lead in the last 7 minutes again we blame Rafa. Im not saying Rafa is not making some dreaded hair pulling subs but you cannot blame him for every thing that goes wrong. we are too small physically. This is the premier league our team and style of play doesnt suit it. You cannot play attractively against team like stoke. Look back at our squad and compare it to the current one. People always talk about Benitez is the manager and he's not motivating the players have anyone of them ever sat in a team talk before. You can motivate them but when they are not good enough they will not win against good sides. Every coach motivates their player it left with the players to use those motivational words and bring the best out of themselves, which we are not doing. First analyze the squad before jumping on the #RafaOut band wagon. 

* Inside all these rambling words you will find that some make sense.

I'm busy today so haven't managed to knock out a rumour thread as yet, can I please remind everyone however if you are posting a link from anywhere apart from a club site or twitter account **it's a rumour**

We try and get the rumour thread up regularly  so we can keep the posts and discussions centrally and keep the sub a little tidier at this time of year. Of course sometimes rumours pop up post the thread, please either add them to the comments on the thread (Preferred) or if you do wish to post them to the sub as a separate post use the [Rumour] tag in the title of the post. If it's from a club site feel free to use [Official] for when we finally sign Cavani ;)

Another point is the use of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) on the sub, a standard we should all try to adhere to when posting and commenting here. 

Please also bear in mind that the up and down vote buttons should be used to moderate on the quality of the submission not your personal opinion.

It means everyone comments will be in the same place, also let's try not to post rumours as fact until they are confirmed by the club.

Also, stay classy on the other subs, it's a shitty situation we're in again as fans of the club, but we've been here before and came out stronger. Don't be baited into shitty arguments with other clubs fans if you can help it.
