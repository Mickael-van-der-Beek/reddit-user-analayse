1339494005.0,12060,self.gaming,uxpil,I've been playing the same game of Civilization II for almost 10 years. This is the result. ,Lycerius,48520,36460,3663,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/uxpil/ive_been_playing_the_same_game_of_civilization_ii/,"http://imgur.com/a/rAnZs

I've been playing the same game of Civ II for 10 years. Though long outdated, I grew fascinated with this particular game because by the time Civ III was released, I was already well into the distant future. I then thought that it might be interesting to see just how far into the future I could get and see what the ramifications would be. Naturally I play other games and have a life, but I often return to this game when I'm not doing anything and carry on. The results are as follows. 

- The world is a hellish nightmare of suffering and devastation.

- There are 3 remaining super nations in the year 3991 A.D, each competing for the scant resources left on the planet after dozens of nuclear wars have rendered vast swaths of the world uninhabitable wastelands. 

-The ice caps have melted over 20 times (somehow) due primarily to the many nuclear wars. As a result, every inch of land in the world that isn't a mountain is inundated swamp land, useless to farming. Most of which is irradiated anyway. 

-As a result, big cities are a thing of the distant past. Roughly 90% of the worlds population (at it's peak 2000 years ago) has died either from nuclear annihilation or famine caused by the global warming that has left absolutely zero arable land to farm. Engineers (late game worker units) are always busy continuously building roads so that new armies can reach the front lines. Roads that are destroyed the very next turn when the enemy goes. So there isn't any time to clear swamps or clean up the nuclear fallout. 

-Only 3 super massive nations are left. The Celts (me), The Vikings, And the Americans. Between the three of us, we have conquered all the other nations that have ever existed and assimilated them into our respective empires. 

-You've heard of the 100 year war? Try the 1700 year war. The three remaining nations have been locked in an eternal death struggle for almost 2000 years. Peace seems to be impossible. Every time a cease fire is signed, the Vikings will surprise attack me or the Americans the very next turn, often with nuclear weapons. Even when the U.N forces a peace treaty. So I can only assume that peace will come only when they're wiped out. It is this that perpetuates the war ad infinitum. Have any of you old Civ II players out there ever had this problem in the post-late game?   

-Because of SDI, ICBMS are usually only used against armies outside of cities. Instead, cities are constantly attacked by spies who plant nuclear devices which then detonate (something I greatly miss from later civ games). Usually the down side to this is that every nation in the world declares war on you. But this is already the case so its no longer a deterrent to anyone. My self included.  

-The only governments left are two theocracies and myself, a communist state. I wanted to stay a democracy, but the Senate would always over-rule me when I wanted to declare war before the Vikings did. This would delay my attack and render my turn and often my plans useless. And of course the Vikings would then break the cease fire like clockwork the very next turn. Something I also miss in later civ games is a little internal politics. Anyway, I was forced to do away with democracy roughly a thousand years ago because it was endangering my empire. But of course the people hate me now and every few years since then, there are massive guerrilla (late game barbarians) uprisings in the heart of my empire that I have to deal with which saps resources from the war effort.

-The military stalemate is air tight. The post-late game in civ II is perfectly balanced because all remaining nations already have all the technologies so there is no advantage. And there are so many units at once on the map that you could lose 20 tank units and not have your lines dented because you have a constant stream moving to the front. This also means that cities are not only tiny towns full of starving people, but that you can never improve the city. ""So you want a granary so you can eat? Sorry; I have to build another tank instead. Maybe next time."" 

-My goal for the next few years is to try and end the war and thus use the engineers to clear swamps and fallout so that farming may resume. I want to rebuild the world. But I'm not sure how. If any of you old Civ II players have any advice, I'm listening.  

Edit: -Wow guys. Thanks for all your support. I had no idea this post would get this kind of response. 
       -I'll be sure to keep you guys updated on my efforts. Whether here on Reddit, or a blog, or both.
       -Turns out a whole subreddit has been dedicated to ending this war. It's at /r/theeternalwar

[Uncharted 2 (178 mins)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfAkg0s7_iA)

[Uncharted 3 (196 mins)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgDq64ATsmU)

The Uncharted games are personally my favorite series of games, with Uncharted 2 and 3 being my favorite games of all time. They're certainly the most cinematic games I've ever played. I've often heard many people describe these games as like controlling a movie, and have heard many people say that these games are just as fun to watch as they are to play, and I agree with both of those things. That gave me the idea to edit these games into movies. That way I would be able to watch the story of these games in one sitting easily, and without having to take up a considerable portion of my day. Not only that, but I would be able to show these to people who either don't have a PS3, don't have or want these games but still are interested in seeing the story, or even don't play video games at all. 

With these projects I was trying to make movies that would be viewable whether or not you had played the game, or even care about playing video games, so I wanted to make them as close to a real movie as possible. This meant taking out as many chapter titles, button prompts, and more to make it seem less like a video game. There were certain aspects I wasn't able to remove, such as the current weapon selected, or an occasional button prompt. I tried to focus mostly on the cinematics, but also include the minimum amount of gameplay to link them, especially focusing on the more cinematic elements of gameplay. I wanted to make sure not to cut any cutscenes or any gameplay that would leave the viewer confused if they hadn't played the game, so in the end Uncharted 2 and 3 were quite long, but that's just because the stories are much more complicated than Uncharted 1's. Either way it's still a lot shorter than playing the real game, so if you are ever in the mood to watch the story of one of these games in one sitting, but don't have the time to play the entire game through, then these are great for that purpose, or if you want to show these games' stories to friends or family that don't care about playing video games. 

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!

Last night, an [absolutely terrible article](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/geek4/22in1_3ds_accessory_kit_how_many_accessories_is/) about a 22-in-1 3DS accessory kit somehow shot immediately onto the gaming frontpage, due to suddenly getting about 10 upvotes shortly after being submitted. At almost the same time, the exact same thing happened with two other GamePro articles, [a video card review](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/geei6/gamepros_review_for_the_amd_radeon_hd_6990_such/) and [a horrible ""top games"" list](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/geg76/the_top_24_playstation_3_games/).

After [calling them out for spamming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/geek4/22in1_3ds_accessory_kit_how_many_accessories_is/c1myszx) and having several fake accounts rally together against me (including a brand new one created just to help out!), I decided to start unraveling this and see just how major of an astroturfing operation they had going here.

To start with, here's a list of the accounts involved, *at a minimum*. There may be more that are less obvious, like l001100, who doesn't submit or comment, but has only come out a couple of times to defend GamePro's honor.

- [HotSexyGamer](http://www.reddit.com/user/HotSexyGamer) - Banned.
- [l001100](http://www.reddit.com/user/l001100) - As mentioned, doesn't submit or comment like the others, but has been used to defend.
- [MasterOfHyrule](http://www.reddit.com/user/MasterOfHyrule) - By far the worst, hundreds of submissions. Seems to have been the original account, but appears to have been banned at some point.
- [MrHotGamer](http://www.reddit.com/user/MrHotGamer)
- [NikoleSmash](http://www.reddit.com/user/NikoleSmash) - Banned.
- [NintendoPwns](http://www.reddit.com/user/NintendoPwns)

- [TheTrueHero](http://www.reddit.com/user/TheTrueHero)
- [Xelestial](http://www.reddit.com/user/Xelestial)

Yeah, they're not really very original when picking most of the account names. Most of these were found by looking through the submission lists for the three domains: [GamePro](http://www.reddit.com/domain/gamepro.com/new) / [G4TV](http://www.reddit.com/domain/g4tv.com/new) / [GamrFeed](http://www.reddit.com/domain/gamrfeed.vgchartz.com/new). You'll see the same names an awful lot. The spam for each domain started at a different time, but it was always initiated by MasterOfHyrule. [GamePro was started first](http://www.reddit.com/domain/gamepro.com/new?count=450&amp;after=t3_bs0d3), about 11 months ago. [G4TV came next](http://www.reddit.com/domain/g4tv.com/?count=300&amp;after=t3_cg8ek), about 9 months ago. And [GamrFeed most recently](http://www.reddit.com/domain/gamrfeed.vgchartz.com/?count=50&amp;after=t3_f3bfz), about 4 months ago.

Now, if you look at the profiles of all the users I listed, quite a few of them may not seem to be completely obvious spammers, most seem to comment a decent amount along with their submissions. However, pay attention to *which stories* they're commenting on (mouse over the titles in their user page and check the domain), it's almost always ones that one of the other accounts submitted, and usually with a very short, generic comment that wouldn't take any time to think of, or write. This is just another way of making their submissions seem more ""active"" when they're pushed up. Some of the comments are on real submissions, this is likely because the person(s) behind these accounts is a bit of a redditor, and just uses the last account they were logged into from their spamming. Going through and getting full statistics of every account's comments seemed a little unnecessary, but for the few I did it for, generally about 90% or more of their comments were on submissions by other accounts listed above.

While looking through comments, I also noticed that a lot of the same accounts are used to support [something called ""Stencyl""](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fnjoc/is_anyone_else_excited_for_stencyls_public_release/) (notice over half the comments there are from these accounts), as well as [almost all of the submissions for neebit.com](http://www.reddit.com/domain/neebit.com/new/). Those are much smaller operations than the domains they're mostly spamming, so this may be a clue as to who's behind them.

Mods, please completely ban these domains from /r/gaming, I'd say they've proven themselves more than worthy of that. If that doesn't happen, everyone, please downvote any submissions from these sites with extreme prejudice. They've been heavily abusing the system for months, and don't deserve any more traffic from reddit.

Some of you may remember me from the [Uncharted movie trilogy I made last year](http://redd.it/sm2nf). This year I've been hard at work editing the Assassin's Creed series into movies. I tried to keep them as short as I could, but these games have a lot of story to them, especially AC3, and making them any shorter than I did would sacrifice that storytelling imo.

I'm planning on making more movies in the future. The next movie I plan to do is the new Tomb Raider game. However, I'm going to be waiting until school is over (May 11th) as editing these movies has been difficult with all the homework I've had lately, which has led to me developing a bad sleep schedule on the days I *do* work on them (I was up 24 hours by the time I went to bed monday morning after finishing AC3) Once I finish school I will have a lot more free time to work on these. After Tomb Raider I'll probably be doing The Last of Us. After that I have a few other ideas, but you can suggest others here if you wish.

I also recently bought an HD capture device, so I will be able to make The Last of Us in HD, unlike my Uncharted movies, and perhaps I will be able to remake my Uncharted movies in HD eventually as well. I plan to make AC4 when it comes out, and will likely be using the PS4 version, as it will likely allow me to capture at a higher resolution than I was capable of doing on the PC. I could have captured at 1080p, but it caused major frame rate lag. I'm assuming this has more to do with hard drive access than my CPU's capabilities, so capturing from an external device would solve this problem, although an SSD may fix it as well. However, while AC3's performance was good enough for capturing at 24fps 99% of the time, it did dip below 24fps in a few spots, so I would fear that AC4 would perform even worse. More reason the PS4 version may be preferable.

1351884224.0,2658,self.gaming,12j1jn,I do graphics programming in games. This is everything you need to know about mirrors in games.,ExpiredPopsicle,14296,11638,1006,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12j1jn/i_do_graphics_programming_in_games_this_is/,"/r/gaming, we need to talk about mirrors in games. I know you're all sick of the subject by now, but I feel like I need to dispel some myths because the ignorance I'm seeing in these threads is making by brain hurt.

But first! Let's talk about performance, and a few of the different things that can affect it.

(Warning: Holy crap this is a lot of text. I'm so sorry.)

**Fill rate**

Fill rate is how fast your GPU can calculate pixel values. At its simplest, it's a factor of how many pixels you draw on the screen, multiplied by the complexity of the fragment shader (and all the factors that go into that, like texture fetches, texture cache performace, blah blah blah). It's also (often) the biggest factor in GPU performance. Adding a few operations to your fragment shaders slows it down by a multiple of how many pixels use that shader.

For a deferred shading engine (like what they use in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. and the newer Unreal engines), this is pretty much a factor of how many pixels are being affected by how many lights, in addition to a base rendering cost that doesn't fluctuate too much. Pixels drawing on top of already-drawn pixels is minimized, and you hopefully end up drawing each pixel on the screen once - plus the lights, which are drawn after the objects.

For a forward rendering system, you might have objects drawing over pixels that have already been rendered, effectively causing the time spent on those already rendered pixels to be wasted. Forward rendering is often considered just drawing models to the screen, and doing somewhat costly queries to the scene graph to see what lights affect the object before rendering. The information about the lights is sent to the shader when the object is drawn, instead of after.

Many engines use hybrid techniques, because both techniques have drawbacks. Deferred can't do alpha (semi-transparent) or anti-aliasing well, so they draw alpha objects after all the deferred objects, using traditional forward-rendering techniques. Alpha objects are also often sorted back-to-front so they render on top of each other correctly.

What does this have to do with mirrors? Well, drawing the whole scene twice is affected by this. It's important that you find a way to clip the rendering to the area that's being reflected. Rendering the whole scene flipped across the mirror's normal axis will effectively double the fill rate cost.

http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter09.html
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillrate

**Vertex and face count**

Each vertex runs through a vertex shader. These can be quite complex because they are generally expected to run for fewer objects than the fragment shaders. In these, the vertex is transformed using matrix math from some coordinate space to the position it will be on the screen.

Skinning also happens there. That is, warping vertex positions to match bone positions. This is significant. You might have fifty-something bones, and maybe up to four bones influencing a single vertex. With that alone, rendering characters becomes much more costly than rendering static level geometry. There are other factors that differentiate characters and dynamic objects from static objects too, affecting vertex shader complexity.

**Draw calls**

There's also an amount of overhead associated just with the act of drawing an object to the screen.

The rendering API (DirectX or OpenGL) has to be set into a different state for each object. It ranges from little things like enabling or disabling alpha blending to setting up all your bone matrices in a huge buffer to send to the graphics card along with the command to render the model. You also set which shaders to use. Depending on the driver implementation and the API, the act of setting up this state can be very expensive. Issuing the render command itself can also be very expensive.

For example, in DirectX 9 it is recommended that you limit yourself to 500 draw calls per frame! Today, you might be able to get away with double that, but I wouldn't push it. (DirectX 10+ and OpenGL do not suffer from overhead that's nearly that extreme.)

When you draw the scene for the flipped point of view of the mirror, you are potentially doubling the number of draw calls.

TL;DR: The number of THINGS you draw to the screen is just as important, if not more important than the number of triangles those things contain. Mirrors may double this count.

http://members.gamedev.net/jhoxley/directx/DirectXForumFAQ.htm#D3D_18

**Skinning information is huge**

Oh yeah. That huge buffer of fifty-something bones I mentioned? That's a big thing to cram into your rendering pipe. When drawing a character, you probably want to draw all the pieces of that character in sequence so you don't have to keep changing the skinning information between calls. (Different pieces like armor and skin will have potentially different shaders associated with them, and need to be rendered as separate calls.)

(Each bone needs at least a 3x4 matrix associated with it, which is 3x4 floating point numbers at 32-bits (4 bytes) each. So that's at least 2400 bytes sent across your bus per frame per character, just for the skinning information. Believe me, this starts adding up.)

**How games used to do it**

Games such as ~~Doom~~, ~~Duke Nukem 3D~~, Wolfenstein 3D, and (maybe) Marathon used what was called a ray-casting engine. For each column of pixels on the screen, a line was sent out from the virtual eye of the character. Any wall it hit would be rendered, and the scale of the column of pixels for the wall would be determined based on how far away it was.

Okay, so that explanation really only covers the Wolfenstein 3D era of raycasting engines, but the other differences are not relevant to the discussion.

A mirror is extremely simple to implement in this type of engine. Once you detect that the line has hit a mirror surface, you take the point where it hit the mirror and restart the line from there, but with the direction flipped across the mirror's axis.

~~Duke Nukem 3D had some other limitations that came into play that required them to have big empty areas behind mirrors. I can only assume this was due to some limitation in their character and sprite drawing rather than the walls and floors themselves.~~

NOTE: ~~RayCASTING and rayTRACING are two different things. Raytracing works for each pixel. I'll discuss raytracing later.~~

EDIT: As a few people pointed out, I got my terminology wrong here. Raycasting and raytracing are similar, but raycasting lacks the recursion. Still, ""raycasting engines"" are commonly the 2.5D variety I specified.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting

TL;DR: When /u/drjonas2 said in his post ( http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12gvsn/as_somehow_who_works_on_video_games_seeing_all/ ) that reflecting Duke Nukem in Duke Nukem 3D was easy, he was right.

**How some games do it now**

* Portal

Portal just renders the game world again on the other side of the portal. It's also a game with extremely limited complexity in rendering. Only a single character, precalculated light maps, reasonably simple materials, and (IIRC) only a single directional light that casts shadows. Using it as a benchmark to judge games with more complicated rendering requirements is ridiculous. Stop doing that. You look really dumb when you do that.

* Fake reflections

Shiny materials can give a good impression of reflecting the environment without actually reflecting the environment. This is often done with a cube map. It's basically just six square shaped textures arranged like a box. We can sample pixels from it with x,y,z instead of just x,y. To visualize what it's doing, imagine a box made up of the six sides of the texture, facing inwards. You are inside the box. You point in some direction indicated by the vector x,y,z. The pixel you're pointing at is what we return, blended with the rest of the material in an appropriate way, for that pixel.

This lets us have a pre-rendered reflection for the scene. It won't cost a whole lot of extra rendering time like it would to constantly re-render the scene for a reflection, but it's also not accurate to what's really in the scene. It gives a pretty good at-a-glance reflectiveness, especially if the cube map is made from rendered views of the environment that your shiny object is in.

If you aren't going for a perfect mirror, this is usually the way to go to make the environment reflect on an object.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cube_mapping

**Render-to-texture versus not render-to-texture**

For those who are okay dealing with the limitations of just rendering the scene to another texture and dealing with the extra draw calls, the fill rate, the vertex processing rate, and all the other stuff that goes with drawing most of your scene twice, there are still limitations to drawing to a texture and plastering that texture on something.

First, lights on one side of the mirror don't affect the other side when you do something like this. Shadows won't be cast across this boundary. And of course you have to keep a big texture in memory for each mirror.

So what do you do? A lot of games just dispense with the texture and have an identical area on the other side of the mirror, duplicating characters and lights across them (Mario 64 did this).

Obviously it's nice if you can do that with some kind of scene graph hack instead of building it into the level data. Maybe a node that just references the root level with a transformation to invert across the mirror axis. Otherwise you're going to subject your level designers to some pain as they try to justify a big inaccessible area in their building that they used for the mirrored area (Duke Nukem 3D had big empty areas behind mirrors, but had other ways to deal with overlapping regions).

**All of this is for flat mirrors only**

Oh yeah. All of this won't work if you want a curved mirror. Fake cube-map reflections work of curved surfaces, but you'll have a very interesting time trying to draw the scene with a curved viewing plane using rasterization with a modern GPU. (See all the junk about raytracing below.)

**Not really worth it**

Another reason you don't see too many perfect mirrors in games is that it doesn't really justify the effort that goes into it. You might be surprised to know this, but if you enjoy spending all your time looking at a mirror in a game then you are the minority. At best, most players give it an ""oh, that's neat"" and then move on to actually play the game. A game company's graphics team can usually spend their time better by fixing bugs and adding more useful features than something that most people will - at best - think is mildly interesting.

Keep in mind the context I'm assuming here is for FPS games. For the Sims, I'd say they're probably perfectly justified in having mirrors. Social games with fancy clothes and customization? Sure. A modern FPS where everyone looks like a generic greenish/brownish military grunt anyway? Meh.

Given all the time in the world, I'd add every graphics feature. I'd really love to. I even get a kick out of adding cool stuff. But right now I have to deal with the fact that the ground in one game is covered in a blocky rendering artifact that only affects DirectX 11 users (which we would very much like people to use instead of DX9), and I have to fix it before the next big update. This is more important than mirrors.

**Raytracing is not a magic bullet**

Raytracing engines have no problem with mirrors, even curved mirrors. They can handle them in much the same way that a raycasting engine would~~, but for each pixel instead of each column~~. Raytracing also handles a bunch of other stuff that rasterization just can't.

EDIT: See note about me mincing words above concerning raycasting vs. raytracing.

However, I'm extremely skeptical about the adoption of real-time raytracing. For every baby step that's been made to support this goal, traditional rasterization techniques have gone forth in leaps. A few years ago nobody had heard of ""deferred shading"" and now it's being adopted by a lot of high-end engines like CryEngine, Unreal Engine, and others.

There's no argument that rasterization techniques are hacky and complicated by comparison, and raytracing is much more elegant and simple, but graphics engineers are not sitting around idly while raytracing plays catch-up. We're making games, and trying to get them to look as pretty as the other devs' games, while still keeping a decent framerate.

EDIT:

**TL;DR**: I refer back to /u/drjonas2 's post: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/12gvsn/as_somehow_who_works_on_video_games_seeing_all/

EDIT:

Doom used a different rendering system involving BSP trees. Woops.
Duke used something else too.

EDIT: Fixed some minced and misused terms.

As you are no doubt aware, allegations have been made that Microsoft and/or PR firms associated with it are participating in efforts to manipulate the content and voting on /r/gaming in order to spin XBox One announcements and information to their advantage.  We as curators of this community take such allegations very seriously, and have completed an investigation.

Yesterday, one individual posted to /r/gaming, claiming to work for a digital marketing firm, and alleged that during a visit to Microsoft's Redmond campus, she overheard Microsoft employees discussing content they had posted on behalf of their employer to ""pics and gaming,"" and that she witnessed one of these employees mass-downvoting reddit content.

This provoked a **HUGE** thread that quickly spiraled out of control, with people digging through other redditors' submission history and then fingering them publicly as a ""Microsoft Shill,"" encouraging everyone else in the thread to engage in mass-downvoting of all these people.  At this time, we were forced to step in and end the thread, as this kind of behavior violates the [Rules of Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) regarding vote manipulation.  Further, some people had become so angry at the allegations of corporate interference that personal information (dox) of people accused of having any affiliation with Microsoft—proof or not—was getting posted.

At this time, I [made a statement](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fwby3/considering_the_last_thread_was_mysteriously/caeim77) regarding what is allowed (discussion for or against the XBox One) and what is not (vote manipulation and posting of personal information).  That statement remains in effect.  In it, I promised that I would share any results of our investigation with the community, and I would like to do so now.

1. In the original post that set off the entire firestorm, **no proof whatsoever** was posted that the submitter worked for any marketing firm or had been to any Microsoft office (pun not intended).  It was literally one giant wall of text with *National Enquirer*-style allegations, and not one iota of supporting evidence.

1. In the comments on that post, several people chimed in with similar stories.  One individual claimed to work for Waggener Edstrom, whose client list does include Microsoft, and alleged that this PR firm was ""really trying to ramp up their presence on blog sites and Reddit in particular.""

1. I have since communicated with Peter Wootton, Senior Vice President for Waggener Edstrom, who reviewed his firm's employee and contractor records and found no trace of the individual in (2) ever having worked for or with them, and as such that individual would have no knowledge of any of the operations of that firm.  I reviewed the data he sent me and found it compelling enough to assert that it is true and correct.

1. I asked Mr. Wootton the following questions, on the record:  
*Is your firm now, or has it been in the past, engaged in using paid or unpaid staff, contractors, volunteers, or associates to post, comment, and/or vote on content for or on behalf of any company, firm, or organization in the /r/Gaming section of reddit.com?  Has your firm ever advised or suggested to any other company, firm, or organization that it should use its own paid or unpaid staff, contractors, volunteers, or associates to post, comment, and/or vote on content in the /r/Gaming section of reddit.com?*

1. His response appears below:  
*Totally fair question, Dan. The answer is no.  Waggener Edstrom adheres to a strict code of ethics and conduct in terms of how we participate in social forums and services as individuals, and on behalf of the clients we counsel and represent.*

1. Mr. Wootton has agreed to participate in this thread and answer questions you might have about his firm and their relationship with Microsoft.  His username is /u/petewootton.  I know many people will have an initial instinct to distrust and downvote, but in my interaction with him over the last 24 hours I do not feel he has misled me, and I do not believe he is trying to mislead you either.  He, after all, has provided proof of who he is and what he does, something the original poster making the allegations completely failed to do.

1. Let's reiterate that last bit there.  The original allegations that Microsoft was engaged in manipulating this community **did not come with any proof** and the person who chimed in to back up those allegations (see point #2 in this list) **has been proven false**.

1. Let's also look at it from a pragmatic standpoint.  If Microsoft *was* trying to manipulate /r/gaming, they're certainly not doing it effectively.  Ever since the XBox One was revealed, the commentary on it in this community has been universally negative.  Our entire front page, for the last 24 hours, has consisted entirely of memes making fun of Microsoft and the XBox One.

When you add all this up, what do we get?  36.  Also, the inevitable conclusion: **/r/gaming, we have been trolled**.  A zero-day account showed up with a lot of claims and no proof, but knew all the right things to say to rile up the community in their revulsion for both the XBox One and corporate interference in our free community.  The post was *explicitly designed* to trigger rage at heavy-handed and Orwellian tactics, and it did exactly that.

Unfortunately, as is often the case with such crowdsourced rage, innocent bystanders got caught in the crossfire and were subjected to abuse and harassment that they'd done nothing to deserve.  Just because they had said something nice—or even neutral—about Microsoft or its latest console, they found themselves at the receiving end of dox dumps, threatening PMs, and crowds of downvote brigades annihilating their user account all over reddit.

Friends, we can do better than that.  We're a big community, and it shouldn't be so easy for someone to register a new account, type a couple paragraphs, and get a three-million-strong pitchfork mob going for funsies and lulz.  When someone comes along with claims like that, we should take a cue from /r/IAmA — ask for proof.  *Demand* proof.  If we had done that in the beginning, we'd have quickly found out the whole thing was a fake, and saved this community from the last day full of headache and front page shenanigans.

In the end, no, we're not being manipulated by Microsoft.  We were manipulated by something much less impressive: one person with no proof and another with a lie.  I hope they got the cheap laughs they were after, because we sure as shit delivered one hell of a show.

We can do better than that.  We owe it to ourselves to do better than that.  I hope, going forward, we do.

I now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.",,False,self,t5_2qh03,False,,,True,t3_1fyjgr,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1fyjgr/regarding_xbox_one_and_allegations_of_voterigging/,moderator

Short background: several people, along with myself, started a small company, Playsaurus. We spent the past ~2 years without pay working to create [this game](http://www.kongregate.com/games/nexoncls/cloudstone). It's called Cloudstone. It's kind of like Diablo, but with brighter colors, and in Flash. It hasn't made much money yet, and we're still working on it to try to improve things and to bring it to more audiences.

About a week ago, we discovered our game was [on a Chinese network](http://apps.pengyou.com/100638897). You need an account on that site play it. But don't give those assholes *any* money!

[Here are some screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/Ltuyq.jpg) to show the similarities. The images on the left are from our game, and the images on the right are from ""their"" game.

It's pretty clear that they blatantly, seriously ripped us off. They took our files, reverse-engineered the server, and hosted the game themselves with Chinese translations. They stole years of our hard work. We have no idea how many users they have or how much money they're making, but they have a pretty high rating on that site and they might be profiting off the stolen game more than we are.

Needless to say, we're a bit peeved. We're talking to lawyers, so this situation *might* get resolved eventually, but who knows how long it will take or if anything will even happen or how much it might cost. It's pretty frustrating to have your work stolen and there's not a whole hell of a lot you can do about it.",,False,self,t5_2qh03,1345142610.0,,,True,t3_yc02l,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/yc02l/some_company_in_china_stole_my_game/,

1260403399.0,2354,self.gaming,acz2t,Let me tell you about Demon's Souls.,Ciserus,3243,889,820,http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/acz2t/let_me_tell_you_about_demons_souls/,"Demon’s Souls is a game that will make you into a man. A scrawny fourteen-year-old, after two hours with this game, will be grooming his muttonchops and ready to ship off on the next boat to fight the Kaiser. If you are already a man, it will make you into some sort of bizarre double-man. What’s that you say? You’re a woman? You don’t want to be a man? Too bad. *Too bad*. That’s the Demon’s Souls way.

You’ve probably heard that Demon’s Souls is hard. Pshh. Lots of games are hard. Some are even harder than this one. The difficulty is not the point. What sets Demon's Souls apart is the way that it doesn't just kill you, but also stomps on your genitals when you’re down. And it will make you realize that that’s what you needed all along.

It’s a lot like life. Sometimes in life you win, and sometimes the giant armored skeleton stabs your face off because the flying mantis monster you didn’t even see shot you in the back with a spike at *just* the wrong time. And when that happens in life, do you respawn at the same spot and carry on like nothing happened? NO, asshole. You go back to the beginning of the level, leaving all your hard-earned souls out there on the pavement, and you fight your way back. And you learn a lesson from the whole thing, because you should have been wearing your Thief’s Ring, now shouldn’t you? That’s life.

The trend in hard games these days is to unlock “Easy” mode for you once you’ve died enough times. Do you think Demon’s Souls does that? Do you think Demon’s Souls is so much as aware of the concept of “Easy” mode? NO IT IS NOT. If Demon’s Souls even knew we were talking about “Easy” mode, it would come over here and kick the shit out of all of us. And we would deserve it.

I’ll tell you what happens in Demon’s Souls when you die. You come back *as a ghost* with your health **capped at half**. And when you keep on dying, the alignment of the world turns black and the enemies get **harder**. That’s right, when you fail in this game, it gets **harder**. Why? Because fuck you is why.

Have I told you about the online elements? At any time when you’re in Body form, another player from anywhere else in the world can *invade your game* and murder you to regain his own body, or just to keep you on your toes. This happens when you’re in the middle of fighting armies of unthinkable monsters that are probably already three-quarters of the way towards killing you. And **no**, you cannot opt out of this feature! This is what you signed up for when you agreed to be a **man**.

When this happened to me -- when a guy strolled into my game like it was Taco Bell and exploded my torso, costing me my body and all my progress in the level -- was I mad? No, because I was too busy *being in awe* at how **fucking hardcore** the experience was.

Now, don’t let this dissuade you. Demon’s Souls is a pitiless master, but let it never be said that it is not fair. The game rewards handsomely those who stand up to it, and the greater the challenge, the greater the glory.

&gt;**Launches**:  2012
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;**Size**: Approximately 1.8 inches tall, 6.8 inches wide and 10.5 inches long.


&gt;**New Controller**: The new controller incorporates a 6.2-inch, 16:9 touch screen and traditional button 
controls, including two analog Circle Pads. This combination removes the traditional 
barriers between games, players and the TV by creating a second window into the 
video game world. The rechargeable controller includes a Power button, Home 
button, +Control Pad, A/B/X/Y buttons, L/R buttons and ZL/ZR buttons. It includes a 
built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, rumble feature, camera, a microphone, stereo 
speakers, a sensor strip and a stylus.



&gt;**Other Controls**: Up to four Wii Remote™ (or Wii Remote Plus) controllers can be connected at once. 
The new console supports all Wii™ controllers and input devices, including the 
Nunchuk™ controller, Classic Controller™, Classic Controller Pro™ and Wii Balance 
Board™.

&gt;**Media**: A single self-loading media bay will play 12-centimeter proprietary high-density 
optical discs for the new console, as well as 12-centimeter Wii optical discs.


&gt;**Video Output**: Supports 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p and 480i. Compatible cables include HDMI, 
component, S-video and composite.


&gt;**Audio Output**: Uses AV Multi Out connector. Six-channel PCM linear output through HDMI.


&gt;**Storage**: The console will have internal flash memory, as well as the option to expand its 
memory using either an SD memory card or an external USB hard disk drive.


&gt;**CPU**:  IBM Power®-based multi-core microprocessor.

&gt;**Other**:   Four USB 2.0 connector slots are included. The new console is backward compatible 
with Wii games and Wii accessories.

&gt;    *(Taken from the Nintendo E3 2011 Press Release)*

**Games announced**: Smash Brothers, Battlefield 3, Batman: Arkham City, Assassin's Creed, Ghost Recon Online, Darksiders II, Dirt, Aliens: Colonial Marines, Metro: Last Light, Tekken, Ninja Gaiden 3, FIFA 12, Madden 12, Driver, Lego City Stories

**Other facts:** (GTTV interview with Reggie, thanks to hiero and others)

- The price point of the system will be competitive to the current prices of the PS3, 360 in terms of value
- The games shown for Wii U at the show were actually PS3 and 360 versions but the Wii U will look the same or better
- No BluRay Support
- Controller's screen is single-touch
- Backwards compatible with the Wii's Games, but no upscaling is done
- Nintendo Online system to be announced by the end of the week

The actual quotes in question:

&gt; Valve has been pursued over the years by Electronic Arts, which would very likely have valued Valve at **well over $1 billion had the talks progressed that far**

No offer was ever made. No valuation was ever made. This is simply speculation that it would have been *well over* 1 billion *if it had happened.*

&gt; Mr. Newell said that there was a better chance that Valve would “disintegrate,” its independent-minded workers scattering, than that it would ever be sold.

~~Gamasutra completely made up the ""I'd rather"" part of that line. It's total fiction.~~

Always online doesn’t bother me. I’m already always online. 

Not buying preowned doesn’t bother me – I always buy new and never trade my games in. 

The Kinect doesn’t bother me because I have the ability to realise I already own half a dozen devices with the ability to listen in/see what I’m doing – including one with a built in GPS that I carry with me everywhere I go. I also realise that if I’m worried about privacy, I should be looking at the government and it’s laws, not you.

But you know what does bother me? Your utter contempt for me. Your lack of focus on me as a gamer. Your failure to recognise that your draconic DRM systems are punishing *me*, the paying customer, and not the pirates who will be playing for free no matter what you do – or playing the same games on PC after pirating them if you do manage to pull it off. Telling me that if I don’t want always online, then I shouldn’t want a next generation system. 

So despite the fact that not one single thing you are doing would really inconvenience me personally, I feel reluctant to give you my money purely because I honestly feel that you just don’t give a damn about me as a gamer. You aren’t interested. 

Sony is bending over backwards to give gamers everything they have ever asked for. We don’t know if they’ll deliver – but they’re a lot more likely to deliver on a promise they’ve made than you are on one you haven’t. 

As a gamer who has *never* owned a Sony console, nor really considered buying one, I was excited for the Xbox One. I was looking forward to buying it and if you had asked me 6 months ago what console I was getting next I would have told you straight up ‘The new Xbox’. Because I figured that you and Sony would basically release the same thing, matching each other’s promises and method to try and outdo one another and capture the gaming audience. 

But no. I look at you and I see a company that says “Oh you want to play games? FINE. But you do it how WE SAY!”. I look at Sony and they’re telling me “Hey, it’s OK, cmere.. we’re going to give you everything you want, everything you’ve asked us for.. no really, everything. All of it.”

This is a message from a gamer who has actually been supporting you all this time – in fact take a stroll through my post history and you will SEE me defend you.

But I’m getting tired of it. I still want to buy the Xbox One.. but the people pushing me away aren’t fanboys or your competition.. it’s you. Because so far, you have yet to give me one single reason as to why I would purchase your console instead of a Playstation.

I think that should worry you.
