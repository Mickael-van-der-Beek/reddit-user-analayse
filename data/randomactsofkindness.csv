My best friend Mickey Shunick went missing around 2 am on Saturday, May 19, 2012. Mickey is an avid bicyclist and always rode home at night. She was last seen leaving a friends house. Over the past couple of days we have had a huge outpouring of support from our community. Donations, Food, Water, and most importantly volunteers have been pouring into our volunteer headquarters at 100 Ryan St. here in Lafayette. We are now asking that everyone upvotes this and related posts. To find other related posts simply search ""Find Mickey Shunick"".

Yesterday we were in deep water, my father and I didn't have the funds to get her cremated, and take care of everything else.. bills, etc.

Suddenly, everyone just came.  They came with food, they came with money, they even came with Dead Space 3.   Two of my moms dear friends called around.  They called everyone my mom has ever known. They came and took care of all the paperwork/phone calls.. everything was taken care of.  Everyone made sure the only thing we have to worry about is her final Celebration of Life, something she told me she always wanted to have when she died.

I guess their kindness wasn't.. out of the blue. They all came together for my mother.  But their kindness is beautiful, and all their deeds were selfless, and gave me hope.

I decided on my way home that since I hadn't had anything but a glass of water all day, I'd stop at Tim Hortons with the last $15 I have to my name and grab a coffee and a bagel in hopes that I'd have enough energy to go in and get more work done in the evening. When I got there the line was backed up to the street and took 10 minutes just to get my order in, all the while my POS car was making all kinds of noises even though I just dropped $300 a couple weeks ago to fix it, and all of this was really pulling me down into a bad place. 

I finally got to the window and tried to forget that I was handing over 1/3 of the rest of my money, when she informed me that the guy ahead of me had bought my order.

I run an automotive repair shop. I had a customer come into today that kind of just shook me and i dont really know where to go to talk about this.
She has been a customer of 4 or 5 years. Nice lady. She came in today and i noticed her hair had a little more gray then normal and she didnt have any make up on. She asked me if i could give her a price on some tires. I said sure Miss Focus lets go take a look. She then stopped me and said im homeless so please if you could work me a deal. It stopped me dead. A year ago she had a job and her own apartment. She got laid off, lost her apartment and moved in with her sister. She couldnt find a job in 3 months so her sisters husband just kicked her out. She was living in her car and finally found this church that housed homeless women.
As she is telling me this she is in tears. So, i tell her to hold on. I take a peek at my inventory and pull out 2 tires. I tell her that i will put the tires on her car, i wont charge her a dime. All that i ask is when she gets on her feet and she is fully caught up, come and see me. I also offered that if ANYTHING happened to her car in the future i would take care of it. Anything. I hugged her and she left.....

Here is a place to post links and tell stories about the kindness that still exists within humanity and in general, a place to become inspired by.

This is what it says in this sub reddits description. And almost all the things I see on here are [requests]. So all right. That's fine. But then I look and they are mostly posts asking for free games and free stuff.

Look, there's a difference for me when I think of 'random acts of kindness'. Helping out someone who really needs it, is great. Like if they really have a shitty time, have no money, and want to buy a toy for their kid, or whatever. 

I don't care for these posts of videogames you want just because your allowance doesn't cut it this month. You got everything you fucking need, and you cannot save up for a little longer or just do it with the dozens of games you already have?

Same goes with other things. We all want stuff. I get it. Getting free stuff is great. But there's a difference wanting stuff because you are materialistic and impatient, and when you really could use help.

I dunno. I just see all these requests and what it says in the side bar, sharing of stories seems, to have long gone. Offer your help. Don't come beg for videogames here, it's ridiculous.

I just felt like saying this. I came here expecting to have my heart warmed, and not see so many people asking for these luxuries that aren't even needed to begin with.

Southwest wasn't going to let them arrive without celebration and fanfare. I was immediately on board.

Everyone at the gate was handed bubbles and signs and cheered as two suprised strangers got off of the plane. The bride got a vail and the groom was handed the cake and the bottle of champagne.

I have two small children, a three year old daughter and a four month old son, and I decided to take them to the zoo even though it was pretty cloudy outside. 

 It had been raining off and on all morning, but the hourly forecast did not call for any more rain, so I thought the zoo would be a wonderful place to have my daughter burn off extra energy.  I'm sure any other redditor parents can relate.  So when we get to the zoo, I let my daughter walk around and have my son in a frontal carrier instead of a stroller.  This is great for him to look around but no so great for the complication of getting the carrier on and off and getting him in and out.  

We have only been at the zoo for less than an hour when it starts to sprinkle.  No big deal I think, and get the compact umbrella that I carry in my purse out.  We start walking back to the entrance of the zoo, which only takes about three minutes, and it starts steadily raining harder.  By the time we get to the parking lot, it is pouring the rain, which is too much for my little umbrella, so all three of us are getting wet.

I was able to get my daughter in the car, but since I had her brother in a frontal carrier, I couldn't bend down far enough in my sedan to buckle her in.  This wasn't a huge deal because I would come back to fasten her in once I got got the baby in his carseat.  At this point there are felines and canines falling from the sky in buckets.  I'm trying desperately to hold onto the umbrella enough to keep my son dry, but then I'm struggling to get him out of the carrier since I need both hands to pull him out. 

 Let me mention that at this point a young blonde lady had run from the zoo entrance to her car sans umbrella, and just happened to be parked beside me.  I'm still trying to pull my son out of the carrier while holding the umbrella overhead with my chin.  The young lady sees that I need help, and gets out of her car, in the absolute pouring rain, without an umbrella to ask if I need any help.  I tell her yes, please, and ask her to pull my son up out of the carrier for me, and she does while I try to hold the umbrella over her.  She hands me my son and I am thanking her profusely, and ask her name, which is Christine.  She gets back in her car and drives off.  Within minutes after I buckle the kids in their seats and get in the car, buckling my at belt, the rain completely tapers off.  

So I doubt that she's a redditor, but I wanted to say again, thank you Christine so much!

I remember I made $5 that day, and I was so thrilled. I found out years later that my mom had called her friend and asked her to come by and buy something so I wouldn't be disappointed.

  
  Today I was driving through a residential neighborhood in another city and I saw a little boy - probably about 7 - sitting at a table with his hands folded, an array of toys in front of him and a hand-lettered sign taped to the end of the table that said ""Toys 4 Sale!!"" in bold marker. I quickly flipped a U-turn, stopped across the street, and went right up to his table. His little sister - maybe 4 - had toys set up too. I bought one item from her, and she took my dollar with an enormous grin and ran to her dad, waving it in the air and bursting with excitement. I carefully went through the boy's toys next and bought something from him as well.

  

  I don't need a digital watch shaped like Gary the Snail, nor a beat-up looking rubber dragon. Chances are, you might pass by a garage sale like this, because you don't either. I'm asking you, if you ever see a child selling their toys in front of their house - don't keep driving. You will make their day if you buy just one little thing, and that dollar will mean much more to them than it likely would to you. It would be very kind indeed.

Today I was taking two cats to be neutered at the Anti-Cruelty Society (I live in Chicago). I dropped them off this morning and as I was on my way back home, I was T-boned by a self-righteous prick (not going to go into details..but the accident was completely avoidable) and my car was damaged enough to not be safely driveable. I was shaken up and angry, upset, and by the time I got back home was on the verge of an anxiety attack (the last time I was involved in a car accident, I was left unable to walk properly or move my neck and arms for weeks.) 

When the time came for me to pick the cats up after their surgery, it was rush hour (5:30) and I had to use public transit to get them home. This involved a bus and a train. I managed to get on the bus ok with my carrier and got off to transfer to the train that would take us home so I could get them settled in and comfortable.

A lady casually asked about the carrier, and we started talking about the two cats inside. We were both going onto the train and I was unable to get on the first two trains to pass by as they were PACKED. FULL. However, this complete stranger stayed with me and talked, helped me maneuver with the carrier and even helped squeeze us onto a train. She ended up living in my neighborhood and she not only kept me company and helped me get the kitties safely home, but also delayed her OWN commute home just to help me, a complete stranger, get home too.

I barely made it home before I cried. I don't even know how to react, because I'm so used to people being nasty around me, and bad things constantly happening, that having a stranger go so much out of her way to help me and make my day so much brighter like that isn't even something I can comprehend. It melted away a lot of the anger and hurt from my accident this morning and restored my faith in humanity just that bit.

I'd dropped out and was working for t-mobile and made a decent life supporting myself but a few months prior had a meltdown and realized I had to go back to school. I caved, called my dad, and asked for help. 

Before I started driving the ~9hrs home, I decided to stop at the grocery store to grab some chips, red bull, etc.

It was a few days before christmas, and I was super down on myself about how poor I was and how my parents were paying for me to head up and how I felt like such a waste, how I felt like I'd failed to support myself. I went in, grabbed some stuff, then realized I was too broke to afford it...

So I walked outside and saw this homeless dude who couldn't have been much older than 30. Seemed like a normal guy, looked a little down on his luck, but not the like creepy ""this guy's on drugs"" homeless. He looked like the unfortunate homeless. It was freezing, pouring rain, and he asked if I had a dollar. I started crying because I didn't. 

I got in my car feeling like a total waste, and realized that I'd been the one who drove to my fraternity's retreat a few days earlier, and didn't even realize that the trunk of my 4Runner was PACKED with camping supplies. Full bags of charcoal, lighter fluid, a costco pack of water, gatorade, a 30 pack of beer, costco boxes of Dorito's, cereal, and one of those massive things of goldfish. 

I wiped my face, called the guy over, and walked toward him with as much of it as I could carry. It took me two trips but I gave him everything I had.

After my art final today, it began to rain. Since I needed to get my piece home, I decided to go grab my car from the school's parking deck so I could drive my massive self portrait home without getting it wet. I brought my friend Alexis along because she likes car rides and she's good company. When we got to the parking garage, I couldn't find my car anywhere. Alexis and I searched all five floors with no luck. Instead of panicking about it, I decided to ask the parking security guy to help me look. After about ten minutes we concluded that it was definitely not there. So, he calls to see if it has been towed. It has. They claimed that I did not pay my parking tickets. I'm pretty sure I did but that's beside the point. The school parking people sent over someone to explain to me how to get my car back. Let's say his name was John. 

For whatever reason, John seemed to take a really perverse pleasure in telling me that it would be a $466 fine to get back my car. He kept smiling and telling me how it was my fault in every way. I don't typically cry over these sort of things, but I really couldn't help it. I didn't know how I was going to pay that fine, or how I was going to get to the towing company to get my car back. John obviously didn't give a fuck and actually *laughed at me* when I started to cry. That's when the parking security guy steps in to the conversation again. I can't say his name because I think he could get in trouble for this, so let's call him Adam. Adam starts asking John (who is his immediate superior) if it would be okay for him to drive me and Alexis to get my car. John keeps telling him, ""It's a liability. You're on the clock. No you can't."" but Adam is not hearing it. He finally asks, ""Well can I take my dinner break, then?"" and John agrees. 

Adam then proceeds to go get his car so he could drive two perfect strangers twenty minutes to the towing company. On his dinner break. He even brought me to the bank so I could get cash to get my car back. We even had to go to a second bank because I reached my withdraw limit. He talked with us about basketball and our majors during the whole ride there. He told me about the time he got his car towed. He even gave me his number just in case things didn't work out at the towing company and we needed a ride back. And he didn't ask for anything in return, either. We gave him a bag of skittles because I felt like I needed to do something to say thank you, but that's it. It's been about an hour now and I still can't believe it. I really can't express how grateful I am that he decided to help me out and make that whole horrible situation somewhat bearable.

I bought a car out in Vermont (I'm from Minnesota) so I hopped on a plane, flew out to Vermont, and I'm in the process of driving it back. I, like most people, don't enjoy obeying the speed limit. So somewhere about halfway through Ohio I came up to a pair of truckers who are going about 65 miles per hour, side by side on the interstate. The speed limit in that area is 70 so I was a little upset because I was going a bit over 80 with my cruise set so I had to put my brakes on and slow down. 

The faster of the two truckers just got past the other semi but did not get back over into the slow lane for some reason. When he finally got back over I saw why he had been going so slow. There was a good ol' Ohio State Patrol car sitting in the median about 100 yards ahead. 

That nice trucker kept me from going over 65 miles per hour to save me from getting a pretty spendy ticket.

They ended up saving my life.,ElDjebena,37,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/1ka2mw/someone_returned_my_wallet_after_one_of_my_worst/,"I had recently broke up with my girlfriend, and we had agreed to talk it out. While I was filling up my car with gas at the gas station, I left my wallet on top of my car and drove away. It fell off halfway to my house around the corner, and I panicked, cancelled everything.

I then proceeded to have a talk with my girlfriend that ended up confirming our breakup, revealing cheating, lying, and more. 
She threatened to ""ruin my reputation"" and ""make sure you never get anything nice in your life again"".

We had been together for two years and this was the last straw. I drank more than I could ever imagine and I felt completely alone.
I couldn't imagine a lower point in my life and my mind started to tell me to take a bunch of pills and all that. 

Then the phone rang. Someone found my wallet on the road. The guy came over, saw that I was completely out of my mind and gave me my wallet - cash still inside, nothing taken.

I offered a reward and I tried to thank him but he had none of it. It was a little gesture, but it meant more to me than he'll ever know. I truly believe I would have hurt myself and others that night, but I was just so thankful that I went straight to bed.

This probably sounds really scripted and cliche but it was a while ago, and my mind has probably selected the best bits and pieces of this story. Nonetheless, I've returned 3 wallets since and each time I've hoped that I was doing something as important as that was to me.

There are Veterans from World Wars I &amp; II buried there as well. 

[Photos](http://imgur.com/a/RFXHE) of the site have been taken to prove it's existence but right now, we need Machete's, rakes, surveyor flags (to mark the human remains) and various other items to help restore the site. 

Oaklynn Cemetery was an African-American cemetery started in 1926 by L.H. McMahon. We have a document signed by him stating that the cemetery was to be ""Public use Forever"" and stamped with the seal of Florida as well as a notary. Somehow over the years, the land fell into the ownership of a company called Massey Enterprises who own the small airport next door. At some point, the county paved a road over 63 plots (its still up in the air if there were people buried there or not) and part of a refueling runway is on the opposite side of the cemetery. It was originally 5 full acres of property. 

I've been in contact with the families and I've had a huge amount of help from a fellow Redditor on this, but when it comes down to it, none of us have the money to really fix this up the way it deserves to be. 

Who would I have to contact to get:

    1. Supplies like I mentioned above.
    2. A surveyor that might help out for free, or at least cheap.

We just got rights to go into the cemetery to renovate from the owner of the property who was a bit of a hardass about the situation. 

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1365065385.0,26,self.randomactsofkindness,1bnf93,Random Kindness from a Stranger when I was really down.,deathcorenoise,30,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/1bnf93/random_kindness_from_a_stranger_when_i_was_really/,"Alright so this happened about a month ago, give or take. But am telling this story now as I only just found this subreddit now, and thought I would share my story.
Anyway, a little back story first. When I was 15 I had my first girlfriend. We dated for a few months, and I ended up losing my virginity to her. It's a very long story, but in short she got pregnant (A girl), and moved away. Jump to today I'm now 19 and haven't seen her in 2 years. Haven't really thought about the whole situation in over a year. As you might think, it's not something that I like to think about. 

Anyway, a good friend of mine was having a party at his house. His parents were going away for the weekend so why the hell not. The plan was that we were going to drink, a lot, and I would stay at his place for the night. Anyway, there was one female there who I was having a chat with. Do not ask me how, but the conversation came up about the whole getting the ex pregnant. I honestly cannot consciously remember how it came up, whether I brought it up (Which I thought was unlikely, as I didn't like to talk about it, but I was wasted so anything was fair game) or a friend who was there had brought it up at some point. Anyway it was irrelevant as what was done was done. So by the end of the night I was sleeping on my friends couch, thinking about my ex and all that. I could not get it out of my mind. And it did not help that I could hear a couple mates banging a couple girls upstairs. So I got up and went for a walk down the road. The area he lived in wasn't a very good area, but I didn't really care. There was a small playground like 30 steps from his front door up the road, it was like a small park kind of thing. So I walked over (more like stumbled over) and sat on a swing, and just had a bit of a cry. It wasn't anything too big, but it was just an 'in the moment' type of thing. I hadn't thought about it for quite some time and it really hit me in the face, like where was my life going, did I make the right choice, all that. So I sat on the swing for about maybe 30 mins. Could have been more, could have been less. But as I was sitting there I noticed that someone was walking towards me. Usually I would have my guard up with some random person walking up to me at 1 in the morning in the street of a dodgy area, but I was too wasted to care. But he didn't look nor act in a threatening manner. He was wearing socks, looked like he was really cold, and was drinking a beer. He walks over ad asks if I was ok. I explained my situation and he just sat there and listened and after I had finished he goes on to explain that we could sit where we were and talk about it, but that he really did not want to get mugged, and that he had a box of beers and a carton of cigarettes he needed help finishing off. He points to his house, which was 2 houses up from my friends place. Again, usually I would be skeptical, but this guy had seemed genuine and he knew my friend. We walked over and just sat on his deck. When we sat down he tells that if I ever need to, I can come over whenever I want but that he had 2 rules: 1. Don't ever bring any hard drugs onto his property, he doesn't mind weed but that was it. I told him that I've never touched the stuff. and 2. If I come over at night not to wake up his 3 year old daughter otherwise he would knock me out (his exact words.) Made me realize that this guy was straight up, and I respected him for that. So we sat on his deck, drinking beer, smoking, and chatting about life. Anything and everything. It was amazing. At around 6:30 he said he better go in and get some sleep, so he hands me a couple extra beers for the road, walks me back to my mates house, shakes my hand and I thanked him for his hospitality. Next morning I woke up with a big smile on my face as everyone was waking up, and I had just had this amazing life changing night. Sorry for this post being so long.

TL:DR At mates party, get wasted, old memories come back, feel like shit, walk in the street, stranger offers an ear to listen to my problem, beers, and some smokes. We chat about life till 6:30 in the morning on his deck 2 houses down from mates house. Go home. Wake up next morning smiling having experienced an strangers amazing random act of kindness.

I told him not to worry about that and that I was perfectly willing to buy him a meal if he wanted more than the onion rings. He politely declined and said that was enough. I was shocked, but it really made me smile. He was in a bad spot, but didn't want me to have to buy him food. He was perfectly fine with eating my leftovers. I couldn't believe it.

A dying breed of people.,NotDumbJustLazy,33,8,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/166w7b/a_good_samaritan_a_dying_breed_of_people/,"Im from a country where money and work is everything. A fast paced community. Its all about how much money you have. About your status as a person. You don't think about others. As long as you've got what you want, that's that.

This worries me. I see more and more successful, rich, people. And as their income grows, their morales and values shrinks. People become selfish, greedy, ignorant. You see less and less good people in my community. Maybe even the world.

The story I'm about to tell shows how ignorant my society has become and how my simple act of kindness changed the perception of a person. I'm not sharing this to praise or boast about myself. Not even to get karma. I'm sharing this to show that a random act of kindness can go a long way. With this, I present to you the story.

It was February 14 2012, Valentines Day. I was greeted by a sweet text message my girlfriend sent me. I then went on with my day. Nothing unusual happened. Just another day. After school, I went to get flowers, chocolates and a balloon. I wasn't the most romantic person. Just following what I saw in the movies. And I was off to see my girl.

I was walking to the train station when from a distance, i saw this sweet, innocent, little girl standing  amongst the crowd of mindless, ignorant people. She was around 5 years old. There she stood, crying her eyes out. I couldn't see an adult with her. Obviously she was lost. Probably got separated from her parents when moving through the crowd. It was crowded at that time. What made it worst was people were just walking past her. Not even looking down on her. Like she was invisible. But if I could see get from a hundred metres away, why couldn't people inches away from her see her? This shows how horrible some people are. They wouldn't even attend to a lost little girl!

So I moved through the crowd. And eventually got to her. I kneeled down, so I would look less threatening. Then I said.
""Umm... Hi. Why are you crying? Its ok. Are you lost?"" I'm not really a smooth talker, mind me.

She stopped crying and just nodded.

""Its ok little girl. I'll help you find your mummy and daddy.""

At that point, she started crying again. God damn i didn't know what to do. But i knew what not to do. That was to leave her alone. I didn't wanted to touch her cause I'd feel like a pedo. Then i realised i was holding a rose, chocolates and a balloon. I wanted to give it to her but what about my girlfriend? She'd be pissed if i came empty handed! I was arguing with myself in my head. To give or not to give? But the cry of a 5 year old girl got to me. At first i only gave her the balloon. But she looked at the rose and chocolate with her sad puppy eyes. I couldn't say no. So i handed them to her with the biggest smile i could give.

She immediately stopped crying. I gave her a napkin to wipe away her tears. She then gave the biggest smile I've ever seen on a kid. It was bright and pure. Man, her smile made me smile. Im smiling right now just thinking about that smile. Immediately after, i saw a woman rushing towards the little girl. It was her mother. She picked up her little girl and hugged her so damn tight. She then saw the gifts her child was holding. She looked at me and said these exact words

""Thank you so much. A good Samaritan. A dying breed of people.""

She gave a smile similar to her child. I knew at that moment that I just made their day. I knew that I gave the woman a sense of hope. That among these emotionless society, there lies a handful of people, a handful of good Samaritans.

That was my story. I'm not asking for praises or anything like that. All im asking for is for that few good people, like you guys, spread your kindness and love to people. You could change, maybe even save a life! Well, i hope this dying breed grows in strength. Thank you for reading.

And I will try to keep it short. 

So I work on signs. Yesterday I was at a location after it rained all morning. I made my way to the sign with minimal slipping in mud and made it to the sign. My buddy and I are working when cops show up (to see what we were doing) they immediately get stuck in their Dodge Charger. I say I will do my best to help, and get in my truck and start to drive to them. I get stuck. Turns out I wouldn't have even been able to help them as it is a city vehicle. I'm annoyed but pretty sure I can get out with the help of my boss. I call him, he comes, I don't move. He buys me a come along and leaves. The cops call the wrecker and it takes them a good hour to hour and a half to get the car out of the mud (its about 100 yards). We finish our work on the sign and it is dark. Just me and my buddy. We tried everything in the book to get my two wheel drive truck out of the mud, but nothing worked. I was so defeated. Tired and hungry and my truck said I had 2 miles of gas left. I didn't want to call a wrecker because for the last few months all of my bills have been piling up and I have been broke for quite a while. I was out of options, probably minutes away from calling the wrecker, even knowing it would drain my bank account. Then out of nowhere (almost literally since we were somewhat secluded) this truck pulls through the mud like its the road. A big jacked up 2002 GMC sierra with wide all terrain tires. I walk up to the truck and he gladly offers his assistance. I had a rope and a tow strap, and after evaluating the options, we tie together and he goes straight through the worst part of the mud with no problem and with pulling me! Ok it actually took 30 minutes because of some rope trouble and such, but I did eventually get out. As soon as I got to the road I offered to pay him (because I was more than willing now because of his kindness). He says he won't accept anything. I make sure to thank him dozens of times and tell him how amazing he is. He even drove us back to the sign one last time to get the rest of the stuff we had left because it was weighing down my truck. This dude was awesome. How he even saw us and knew we were stuck, AND was able to find how to get to us was amazing to me by itself. But he got a little muddy, put strain on his truck, and took time to help two random people that were in dire need. I got home by 11:30pm but it would have been much later if he had not arrived. 

I have always had the intention to help people on the side of the road, but a lot of times i just justify in my head how they don't need it. I'm done with that. I'll go out of my way to help people with car trouble... Unless they are stuck as bad as I was because I wouldn't be much help. 

So Thank you Joel for being one of the nicest people I have ever met.

This made my day and I just wanted to share. It was a simple text I received from my best friend.

""[Bump424] I'm 100% serious about this, if I buy you a plane ticket will you visit me?""

That's it. A text from my best friend. And I know for a fact she is 100% serious about it. It was so special for a number of reasons:

One is because I haven't seen her in a few years. She was in a two year program at college and then moved to the west coast. I am still on the east coast and just finished my 4 year degree. Besides the exchange of a few calls and texts, it's been awhile since I really have heard from her and seen her. It was out of the blue which show how sincere she is at missing me.

Another is because I know she works 70 hours a week and doesn't make much money at her job but she is following her dream. For her to be 100% serious about buying a plane ticket from the west coast to the east coast with her own money just goes to show her capacity to care for her friends.

I want to visit her. Hell, I would moved to the area she lives in because it sounds awesome and she always mentions how it seems like my kind of place. I refused her offer though in the most polite way I could because I would never let her spend her hard earned money on me. I let her know how much I love her as a friend, especially for being 100% serious about it. I'm hoping to find a job to gain experience and income so I can visit and hopefully move to that area someday.

She is an amazing person who inspires me and that text alone couldn't express anymore how much she cares. It was the level of kindness expressed in that text that brightened my day. I showed my family and friends that text for the next few days and explained why she is my best friend. I am sharing here to hopefully inspire a random redditor who hasn't seen or heard from a good friend in awhile to just send them a simple message with good intentions. It will make their day and hopefully yours as well

My husband's a soldier and we live just outside of our Army post. Last week, my sister was visiting me and one night we went through one of the gates on our way to the gas station. 

The gate guard that night was a young soldier (MP). I always try to be really nice to the gate guards (soldiers and civilian security), and said in my usual friendly tone, ""Hey! How's it going?"" as he checked our IDs. He said, in a really dejected tone, ""It's going."" He just sounded really defeated, like he had the crappiest of days. We drove off, and immediately got the idea to do something nice for him to cheer him up.

I bought a Monster energy drink, Kit-Kat bar, and cool ranch Doritos at the gas station. We went back to the gate and pulled up to him again. I told him that when we went through a few minutes ago we thought he sounded like he needed a pick-me-up, and so we got him some snacks. I was really nervous because I have social anxiety, and so this was going way out of my comfort zone and I was worried he would think we were weirdos or suspicious or something.

But, his face lit right up like a kid on Christmas morning and he seemed in disbelief that somebody would do that for him. We gave him the bag of snacks and told him to have a good night, then left the gate and drove home. It was such a great feeling and we were so happy we did that for him.

**TL;DR**: I bought a bag of snacks for a dejected soldier on guard duty.

Today, my husband's on staff duty and will be gone for 24 hours. I have the urge to make a big batch of brownies to take to the main gate where there are 3-8 guards at any time.

I told him that I did not have a money-saving reason--I simply wanted to pay for my girlfriend's flight so I could see her earlier/for more time.  He thanked me for my honesty, said I wouldn't believe how many times people would lie to him just to save a few bucks, and then told me he was going to waive the fee anyway.

""Sometimes, I can tell when somebody just needs a break.""
""Well--I really, really appreciate that.""
""Oh I know you do son, don't worry about it.  Have a safe trip and God bless.""
""Thank you so much.  You too.""

I wanted to see my girlfriend--which is selfish of me.  But I was more than willing to pay the fee and I didn't want to lie about someone dying or being sick just to save some money.

I didn't have any other way of paying for gas than at the front counter because we didn't have a debit or credit card.

The small town was dead silent and dark at that time of night, and everything was closed. Even the gas station had its lights off.

I didn't want to touch the thing because wellâ¦ who knows what could be in there! What if that was some stolen merchandise, or even worse, drugs or lots of money? I wanted to leave it there and to not touch it under any circumstance. A woman sitting at the other table just told us to open it. I still didn't want to but my friend couldn't resist the temptation and proceeded to do so.

It was an expensive Cologne for men. We thought that perhaps the owner would come back, but after 30 minutes of nothing happening, we decided to leave. I let him keep it because I already have a cologne I like. However, I wanted to share this strange tale with you people.

So far, the following has been done:

1. I brought food in for my coworkers to enjoy this morning.
1. My dad met a guy this morning who was down on his luck, offered for him to do some menial work, and paid the guy $100 so he can get groceries for his family.
1. My younger brother helped a coworker with his shop-opening duties, in addition to his own work tasks.
1. A friend stayed home to make his kids pancakes.
1. A friend who works on a merchant ship, and hasn't been on dry land in 3 months, gave up his spot on a boat for shore leave to let one of his coworkers get home and spend some time with family.
1. Another friend and her daughter colored some pictures and sent them off to www.colorasmile.org.

And that's where we're at, right around lunchtime. It's been a fantastic day.

1. A friend bought a homeless man some lunch.

A large part of this retreat involved groups of students being placed to share stories about their lives and hardships, which is where I am placed with a bunch of people, and many tough stories were shared.

After this activity I catch up with my buddies which were separated, and I hear word of a story a particular girl shared involving medical complications, lack of self image, suicidal thoughts and self harm. I felt empathetic for her, since she is rather large, and i am in the same boat too, being overweight.

We continue our retreat, doing various other activities, and the next morning comes, where our final activity was to meet up with our groups and have a paper taped to our backs where we would write each other anonymous compliments. once we pass around our compliments in our smaller ""share group"" we move to a room where everyone attending the retreat is held. 

I once again meet up with my buddies and thought i would give one of them a compliment since they are going through harder times, when the aforementioned girl gets behind me to write something. Having finished my compliment for said buddy, i begin to notice that the girl is taking her time and writing a much larger compliment than all the other ones previously received, and jokingly (*although i kinda regret it now*) I said ""For a girl i barely know, you have a lot to say"". She finishes up, and we then leave. It is only until i got to the bus stop to get on a bus home that i decided to look at what she had written. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/FlvXGYp) is her compliment for me which she wrote. When i saw this, although I was happy for the compliment, i felt bad and remorseful for her since i never once felt like i should pay attention to her, and at what i had said to her as she was writing this compliment.

Although this may be something **very** insignificant, It made me feel really good, and if by any chance you are reading my post, that is the sweetest and most sincere compliment i have ever been given. Hang in there, and i wish you the best of luck and health. Maybe strike up a conversation with me at the gym next time, I'm quite shy.

&gt;This fund will be used to pay off the large sum of medical bills I have that insurance refused to cover for my final I.C. diagnosis.


&gt;2.5 years ago I started having chronic pain everyday. Doctor after doctor would tell me nothing was wrong and send me to another doctor or specialist. Test after test would show nothing was wrong and would result in more tests. I finally found a doctor willing to listen that this was not all in my head and he did 2 final tests and diagnosed me with Interstitial Cystitis. If you are unfamiliar, it is commonly called I.C. or chronic painful bladder syndrome. The wonderful news is with supplements, a night time medication, diet, and physical therapy, I have been living pain free since September 12, 2012!

&gt;The medical bills have been the biggest point of stress in my life. I pay them on time every month and always pay as much as possible on them, but with some of the tests being in the thousands of dollars, and having to see multiple doctors with insurance claiming it is a pre-existing condition, those bills are now totaling in the $10,000 range. I hate to ask for anything, and I don't want to ask for much, but I would genuinely appreciate your donation to making a headway towards not having these medical bills drown me anymore. I hope that one day, some day, somehow I can repay your kindness. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

&gt;I also hope that this will raise awareness for Interstitial Cystitis patients everywhere. It's a traumatizing experience to go through and extremely painful days and nights without sleep sometimes, the bills just add to the stress causing the pain to flare more from being unrelaxed. Please educate yourself and others on I.C. it goes undiagnosed in women and men everyday.

As I said, she has no idea that I'm posting this and I want it to stay that way. She was always there for me when we were younger and I haven't been able to be there for her much in the past few years, so maybe this will make up for some of that.

As of right now a new pair of glasses is not in their budget. Today is her first day back this week since their fight (she has also kicked him out of their house thankfully). She is literally holding transactions to her nose and can barely see them. It literally broke my heart.

1: I'm not karma whoring

2: I've posted very personal things on my main account

So here goes. I love my wife, and I appreciate everything she does, but she is very very selfless and I don't often feel like I have a way to give back to her that lives up to what she deserves. I know I'm hopping on a bandwagon here with indiegogo, but it was because of Karen Klein that I've come to discover something that I can do for my wife. I want to get her a new car. She's had it rough the last couple of years. She fought cancer once, and it has come back again. This is the same cancer that killed her mother. My son had surgery due to fluid build up behind his ears that was making him nearly deaf. She's supported my while going to school fulltime and working fulltime by taking care of the kids every single moment on top of working. Most recently she was very heavily harrased by a lot of people on a message board she runs that supports people with Eating Disorders that are looking for help. On top of it she has to worry about her car. We live in Phoenix, Arizona and it's already 110+ degrees and before too long it will reach 120+. Her car does not have AC, and it's at almost 140,000 miles. We've looked at getting a new/used car, but she has $40,000 in medical bills and $30,000 in student loans. She can't get a loan for a car. I am currently making payments on a car, and we don't make enough to qualify for a second car loan, whether on my credit, or together (her credit is abbysmal due to the amount she owes). I want to get her a new car so I started this campaign, and I'm hoping that there is enough generosity left to surprise my wife with a new car. I started an indigogo page just for this, and even if you don't want to contribute please upvote so that others may see. I'm trying to keep this hidden from the wife, but she's a redditor as well (I drove her too it!). So hopefully I can pull this off without her being the wiser. Please help my wife Reddit, and thank you so very much, even if all you did was upvote this post so that others may see it!

Unfortunately, she was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. The prognosis is very good, and she's expected to win as it was caught fairly early. That's the good news. The bad news is that her treatment plan involves at least 6 months of chemo starting soon and perhaps a year battle all said and done. Here's some proof, I know it doesn't say BC on it, but it's the best I could do quickly this morning on the way out the door with what I had. (proof: http://i.imgur.com/hKqIp.jpg)

They could be a card from the restaurant down the street, the dentist office, a roofing contractor, a mechanic,  one of your colleagues... it doesn't matter. Just grab a few during your travels and anonymously drop them in the mail. Just a few cards from cool places will go a long way. Even if you can't send some cards, how about an upvote to get this in front of more people?

I can't thank you all enough. I'm using a throwaway and a PO BOX to protect her privacy.

My friend went to Mexico to see his family that he hasn't seen in a long time. He started to have a bad headache, lost his vision, and had trouble speaking. They took him to the hospital, and found out he had a rapidly growing brain tumor. He was transferred across the border to a Texas hospital where they made arrangements to be life flighted to KU MED center in Kansas City where he was scheduled to have surgery on Thursday by one of the top neurosurgeons in the country. While waiting for a bed to open up in the hospital his insurance company reviewed the case and opted to not pay for the flight, and insisted if they still wanted it they pay the $18,000 dollar cost of the flight up front.

He has three young daughters, and all he wants to do is have the best opportunity to beat this so he can watch them grow up. He's one of the nicest men I've ever met, and would do anything he could to help out someone in his own situation. We're running out of time, and options, so please if there is anything anyone knows of to help let me know.

They can't fly a commercial flight because of the pressurization on 
the planes, and he's not really in the type of shape to be flying that way. They suggest that he fly at lower altitudes,and on a private jet if possible, but that's still out of their price range. His wife is with him in Texas, but they have no idea how they're going to make this happen. PLEASE HELP!!

UPDATE: The big wigs at his work (cheesecake factory) called the big wigs at their insurance company they use for their employees, and got it pushed through! Plane is leaving now!

I anticipated maybe 100 friends and family to ""participate"".  I am now at 1,071 people and countless people doing things for others in the name of Marc Schluter.  I have been interviewed for papers twice and on the television news once.  People **ARE** good!

https://www.facebook.com/events/349707088459755/

**This is the event description**
This December 23rd marks the 20th year since we lost Marc Schluter to that tragic black ice accident. There isn't a day that goes by that I don't think of my little brother. His looks and character live on in each of my children in his own special way. This Christmas will be another hard milestone for my family; it doesn't get any better you just get more used to the hole in your heart. In honor of Marc's memory, I'd love it if you come and Celebrate Life each in your own way(s). 

You didn't know him? That's alright, if he had met you, you would have had a friend. Feel free to participate anyways, he won't mind.

I have a few suggestions:

1. Share a story about Marc on this event.

2. Share pictures of Marc on this event, especially if you are in them too and tell us the back story.

3. Marc had a big heart and would have given you the shirt off his back if you asked him, so pass it on. Do something for someone else. Big thing or small thing. Buy coffee for someone in line behind you. Drop off a present on the front steps of a household that has little. Donate to a charity. Buy a coworker lunch. Rake a neighbor's yard. Whatever it is, let it be known it was done for Marc Schluter. For example, tell the clerk that Marc Schluter picked up the coffee tab, sign the gift tag with Marc Schluter, make the donation in his name, tell your neighbor that Marc Schluter raked their yard. Let us know what you did if you want. 

4. Touch bases with my parents; no parent should have to buy their offspring. Just write, call, message, text, or stop in and say ""Hi, I'm thinking of you.""

5. If you have children, hug them...often...you never know. Tell them about the friend you knew named Marc.

6. Think of him and smile because you knew him. Then pass that smile on to someone else and tell them it is from Marc.

7. Stop by while I brew my yearly Angel Over My Shoulder beer on December 23rd. I usually start late afternoon so that the first star of the night shines over my shoulder letting me know that my yearly brew buddy has arrived, we won't mind the company.

8. Pass the challenge on to someone else, even if they didn't know him.

It doesn't matter to me what the person is like on a personal scale. I don't care what their age, race, sexual orientation, religion, and the like is, but when I notice a complete and utter stranger give a genuine smile, it spreads. I smile and feel fuzzy like one of my grandmother's knitted mittens; especially when it's because of something I said, because then I know that I made someone smile.

I'd like to request that some kindhearted redditors drop an anonymous pick-me-up of some sort to strangers via a note. Whether it's a small compliment, the simple request that the stranger smile, a heartfelt story, or a nice quote, I'm asking you redditors to put a sticky note on someone's car while passing by in the parking lot, sliding an index card into someone's desk at school, putting it in the fridge at work if you have one, or otherwise drop a note. If you do so, I'd also like to ask that you tell me what was on it, though this obviously isn't a requirement, it's just my curiosity.

Mine all say something about, well, how I like to see strangers smile, because this is my personal thing that I'm focusing on. I've decorated them so that they're colorful, and I've written them in a writing style that differentiates from my own.

On my way to Wal*Mart, I had seen a homeless guy on the street, and I had asked my mother why he was sitting in the street. She had then explained why he was there and what was wrong with him. I asked if I could share my money with him.

She asked if I really wanted to give it to him. I had responded yes all times. She turned around towards the man, and had walked out there with me. I greeted and asked what his name was. It turned out he was a veteran. I'm not sure what war he was in, but he was a veteran. 

After all of us had talked for about 5 minutes, I had offered my $15. He greatly accepted it and thanked us multiple times. I was kind of upset that I couldn't get the toy I had wanted, but my mother was there to tell me that what I did was a great choice.

1348490878.0,19,self.randomactsofkindness,10e1g5,I don't know even know what to put in the title. Little girl with a crap life and a bleak future?,SockBramson,20,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/10e1g5/i_dont_know_even_know_what_to_put_in_the_title/,"My fiance and I don't make a lot of money but we have everything we need so this isn't about us.

She has a little cousin who lives five minutes away. She is 10-years old I believe (somewhere around that). But before I tell you about her let me tell you about the major players in this girl's life.

**Her Dad-** The biggest piece of shit I've ever met. Former heroin addict. No job. Makes money by giving people criminally terrible tattoos. Drunk. Frequently shows up at little girl's school to pick her up drunk which the other kids tease her for. I heard a story that when his own mother was on her death bed dying of cancer a nurse caught him syphoning off her pain medicine for himself. Has Hepititis from the heroin. Oh and he beats her mom occasionally.

**Her Mom -** Ex heroin junkie. Doesn't work. Is on disability for various things related to a car accident. Really nice lady who constantly makes bad decisions. Will spend their entire month's food stamps in 2 weeks buying expensive food instead of spending it wisely. Also has Hepititis either from the heroin or one of her husband's shitty tattoos.

**Her Grandmother -** Smokes weed. Nice old woman. She is the breadwinner of the house. Seriously. She can barely walk and she is the only one in the house with a job. She works for a cleaning company. She walks all over town cleaning offices.

Okay so that's everyone. Here's what's going on with this little girl.

Basically with these two fuckups and the grandmother the little girl gets forgotten. She has been held back a year in school not because she's stupid or lazy. Her parents don't even put forward the effort to get her to school.

A couple months back on my birthday her father was arrested. He and his friends were stealing air conditioners from commercial businesses at night and selling them to scrap yards. With his record he will probably spend a lot of time in jail.

I rarely take joy in the misfortune of others but this was a rare exception. I genuinely feel like this dirtbag going away will help this entire family.

Unfortunately the wife doesn't feel this way. She thinks she lost a great man unjustly even though he has never done anything for his family but bring them misery. From what I've gathered she's started drinking more and bugs my fiance to take her to visit her husband a lot.

Anyway let me get back to the crux of the story.

Couple weeks ago my fiance went over to see her cousin the night before school started. Her mom was drunk out of her mind and told her, (paraphrasing) ""She doesn't have school clothes. We're gonna take her in a couple days so she'll have to miss some school til then.""

Unbelievable. The school isn't private but asks children to wear a white polo shirt and slacks. Her mom couldn't get her a $10 outfit so she could go to school (but can get drunk.)

So my fiance immediately drove to wal-mart and bought her school clothes. In fact she buys this girl stuff a lot. Sometimes she'll just swing by and take her out for an afternoon just to get her out of that house for awhile.

I feel bad because this girl doesn't even have a chance in the environment she's growing up in. I would ask you guys for something but I honestly don't know that would be.

So I guess. Advice? I'm getting to my breaking point. Do I go over and scream at her mother? Don't see how that would help.

If you guys have any ideas that require me to get more information I can.

**tl;dr** This girl's life just plain sucks.

Oh almost forgot. There was a creepy old man who lived down the street from her. He's in jail now. I'll leave it at that.",,False,self,t5_2rl0v,1348491096.0,,,True,t3_10e1g5,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/10e1g5/i_dont_know_even_know_what_to_put_in_the_title/,

She took that 144 dollars and spent the rest, hoping to get commissions to pay for it so she can actually eat.


Migraines have made it impossible for her to stream her art long, but I've convinced her to let me put up this post again asking for donations or commissions that can be finished later (144 dollars in commissions isn't a very small list). Her drawings are cute.

Do people like that deserve to be helped in this subreddit? 

The reason we have made this change of no more tags is because we want to have a more story-telling approach. We don't want to do requests and offers, we want to inspire people. Other sub-reddits like /r/RandomKindness do requests and offers much, *much* better then we do here. 

We'd prefer to have a sub-Reddit where you come here and read small but kind stories of others helping others. Like if you browse AskReddit and come across such stories: Link them here! We can't get enough of those. 

The only reason we still allow offers (no tag) is because it is in itself a random act of kindness, and we do not want to deny people that. But even for that there are other subreddits which are bigger that can do it better.

My dad, who has been working class all his life and has been on very low pay dead end jobs for years has never been able to afford to set foot in the US, so when I left to come here he asked if I could bring him back something special and that is what I plan to do. He has been a long term fan of the motorcycle building show 'American Chopper' so I have decided to get him some memorabilia from said show to take back with me. But what I would love to get him more than anything, is a signed photograph of the Orange County Chopper team (Paul Sr and his sons). Signed to him if possible, (his name is Neill). 

I don't know if reddit has this sort of power but Its worth asking, I cant really afford to fly to orange county or wherever they currently are but maybe someone closer could fulfill this request. So I ask reddit, can you make my old man happy?

Also, all of the college students have already sublet their places or moved out, I have no more favors I could ask, and the only friend that doesn't live out in the suburbs and far away from my place of employment just had a kid, so I need a place between the Mon and Allegheny **NOW**.

**Supreme Overlord Colbert, I Require Your Assistance**
---My name is Daniel and I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. Up until about two weeks ago, I had been attending Edinboro University of PA, going into my Junior year. Although I am a highly unmotivated individual with few concrete goals for the future, I put everything I could into my college experience. More often than not, that amounted to less studying and more socializing in my first few semesters at this fine institution. Of course, this resulted in some poor grades and some dropped classes. This summer, I finally decided what I wanted to do with my life. I realized just how much I enjoyed selling things to Americans, and how amazingly easy it turned out to be. After taking the previous semester off for being unable to motivate myself to do well, I chose to come back to school for a degree in Marketing/Business Administration. Since my previously declared major was Secondary Education with a focus in History, I entered this year as a freshman by credits.

Over the summer, I had a part time job that I lost due to a string of bad luck. Bosses mixing up my availability coupled with the person I was carpooling with changing her shift without notifying me led to my termination from the Arcade I was working at. I took this as a blessing and a way for me to force myself to find the time to concentrate on my studies. To be honest, it also meant I didn't have to deal with angry parents and whining children any longer either. It didn't shake me too much because I had money saved up in case anything happened, and I  was waiting to receive a refund check from the University after my government loans cleared. I was living in an apartment with two friends over the summer, and we continued that into the semester. 

With my previous semester being so awful, I was told by the admissions office that I would need to fill out an appeal form for reinstatement purposes, complete with a one to two page letter to the board stating why I should be allowed back to school. I filled out all of the proper paperwork and turned it into the school before the date they asked. A month or so went by and I still hadn't heard anything, which I considered to be good news. I shouldn't have been so optimistic. When I returned to the admissions office, I was told to wait while they located my file, which they failed to produce. I was told to fill out the forms again, and to rewrite the appeal letter. Luckily, I had it saved to my google docs still, and was able to get it all turned in that day. I asked how long I should wait before checking in with them again. The wonderfully ignorant desk clerk told me it should take about two weeks to process the paperwork. I waited the two weeks and visited them again, speaking to a different desk clerk this time. The intent of this visit was to receive my online pin to begin scheduling for classes. Everything went smoothly and I walked out feeling great.

I went back to my apartment and scheduled for classes. This happened to fall on the morning classes started. I finished my schedule at 8:30am, finally perfecting it, and began walking to class at 9am. I shouldn't have assumed that just because my classes were scheduled and since I had been attending them, my financial aid situation was taken care of. That was a big mistake. I had completely forgotten to fill out the online request for government aid (FAFSA) and was informed immediately to do so. At this point, it would be late September. Using the internet browser ""Opera Next,"" on my home computer, I filled out the FAFSA in full. When I submitted my information, it hung on the loading screen and I thought that meant it was fine, or that my internet may have been lagging a bit. I went to the Financial Aid building the next day and let them know I filled it out and to await the results. I asked if there was anything else I needed to do, and I was told I would be all set. A few weeks later, in early October, I was getting a little nervous. 

The money I had saved up was dwindling and I had begun to run out of food. I cannot stress to you how difficult it is to get out of bed in the morning when you are unsure as to where your next meal will be coming from. I am not without help, however. I have a network of amazing people who have stuck by me through the years and who truly care about me. I had to dismiss the urge to be prideful to accept help from those I could, including my parents who have, on numerous occasion, been gracious enough to provide me with a week's worth of groceries here and there. As I saw my bank account growing smaller, my apartment complex's landlord began demanding my money.

How it works here is, the lessee gives the office a check for the entire sum of the rent for the semester, and signs a form saying he allows that check to be held until a certain date specified at the time. In my situation, I had given them a check with every intent of having the money in my account the day the check was supposed to be cashed. When I found out that my aid was still not received by the school, I tried to reason with the secretaries and my landlord at the office. They told me that, with or without me having money, they still HAD to cash the check on the specified date. Upon doing so, they realized I couldn't pay when the check was returned to them as ""Insufficient Funds."" The office added on a ""Returned Check Fee"" to my bill, as well as the bank charging me for the same thing. Before this first bounced check, my account had approximately one dollar and forty-three cents in it. 

I immediately went to the Financial Aid office, again, to be told that my FAFSA was still not received. When I visited the website that night, none of my information was still saved, and it showed that nothing had been submitted. I asked my roommate and he told me I should try using Google Chrome, and that Opera Next isn't supported by a lot of interfaces on websites, primarily because it is still in a period of beta testing. I didn't think about that at all previously, but it made sense to me so I tried it. The FAFSA submitted properly on October 23. I was told by the Financial Aid office that it would take about two weeks to process and that there shouldn't be any more hiccups. I waited a week, after learning from my past experiences of listening to the office's advice, and visited them again. A different desk clerk brought up my file on her computer and asked me why I had never completed the reinstatement paperwork for my financial aid. I was shocked. I asked her to repeat the question. 

I couldn't fathom the idea that desk clerks, working within the confines of the same building, could actually have this little inter-departmental communication. I asked her why I hadn't been notified of this problem before, and she responded with ""Well, we're different departments completely. I have no idea what they do over there."" I was outraged. I took the paperwork necessary and completed it, knowing full-well that it was going to take at least another two weeks to get this figured out.

Throughout this time, employees in the office of the complex where I was living had been trying to give me some help, but were the opposite of understanding. They know that sometimes it takes a bit extra time, but my case was an extreme and they just couldn't bring themselves to comprehend it. I understand their mentality. College kids try to get out of paying for things all the time. That's almost what college is about: learning how to live on as little as possible so that one day you can appreciate everything just a little bit more. The employees of the office were just doing their jobs, but I feel like they could have been a bit more lenient. In the time I was waiting for my financial aid, I wrote and asked them not to cash three different checks, which all bounced. 

A week ago today, I was informed by the school that I would most likely be receiving no financial aid from the state or federal government. I'll admit, I messed around a lot in my early semesters of college. I wasted thousands of dollars that I'll eventually have to pay back, all for essentially nothing. And that's my own fault. This semester I changed my ways. I was looking at the world in a completely different way. I finally figured out what I believe to be my purpose, and I was working towards that goal. After finding out my funding wouldn't be received, and that everything I had been working for this semester had been for naught, I went to discuss things with my landlord. I had been out for a couple days between these events, in which time the office had posted three letters stating to come talk to them or I would be evicted. When I got home, I marched over to face my inevitable fate. I knew I wouldn't be able to come up with a sum as large as $3200, the amount of the rent plus the late fees and bounced check fees, in just one day. That's how he worded it. ""You have until tomorrow at noon to remove all of your belongings from the premises or the police will be notified to escort you out. It's just business.""

That all happened two days ago. I got out everything I owned and stored it at a friend's place, too terrified to tell my mother about all of this. This morning, I was asleep on my friend's couch when there was a knock on the door. A man identified himself as Officer Lawrence and demanded I opened the door. He told me that in addition to whatever civil claims the apartment complex planned on filing, he also needed my information so he could document it in my case of check fraud. He asked where he'd be able to find me tomorrow so that he could arrest me if I didn't pay the amount in full by then.

I'm twenty years old. I live a decent life, and the people around me really seem to enjoy my company. Maybe they just keep me around for my beard. I can't go to jail. I'd like to be able to avoid that for my entire life. I don't feel like a string of bad luck and misplaced paperwork should end this way. In high school, you were my idol. I watched your show every chance I could, even without cable. I would visit friends to use their internet to stream your show because I loved it that much. I still do. I was so enthused with the idea of the Colbert Nation that I designed my senior project around you. 

Now, I am not an artist by any definition of the word, but I poured my heart and soul into this piece (see attached photograph). It took me about forty hours of classtime to finish the portrait in your likeness. I couldn't take it home for fear of my cat or little brother accidentally doing harm to my artwork. I used a grid. I used a reference picture and enlarged it. Extremely basic techniques. It's the only thing in my life that I have that I can look at and say ""I made that with my own two hands, and it's amazing."" Not because of raw talent, but because of hard work. It has been my dream to have this portrait featured on your show since I made it, and I just finally found myself in a situation where you could very well be my last hope.

My entire family is in debt. My friends' families are in debt. The ones with money refuse to help me. Whatever happened to people understanding that we all fall on rough times, and that it isn't always our own fault? I know it isn't anything special, but the portrait means a lot to me and I hope you can see that for what it is. I don't know of anyone, besides possibly you, who could help me avoid a prison sentence for check fraud at age twenty. I didn't even know I was committing fraud! 

This is unbearable for me. I can't stand feeling helpless, and I'm very rarely known as the one who asks for help unless he absolutely needs it. If you could find it in yourself to purchase this portrait from me for three thousand, two hundred dollars, I would do anything. In the age of technology, I know what that could entail. Hell, if you could find it in your heart and wallet to officially lend me the money, I'd still do anything and still would find a way to pay you back as soon as I possibly can get out of this mess.

Help me Stephen Colbert, you're my only hope. ---

Today, I bought a homeless woman food, so let me explain the story in full detail. I go to the UCR Science Library every Tuesday and Thursday to study, and since I'm only a highschool student, I cannot park in the UCR parking lot because I don't have a permit. Instead, I park in this plaza, 20 minutes away from the library on foot, called the University Village. It was around 10:20 PM, and I was scurrying to my car because it was pretty cold outside. As I was nearing the plaza, I saw this silhoutte in front of me walking on crutches. I thought to myself, ""Who could be out at this late at night traveling on crutches?"". A part of me wanted me to stop and offer any help this person might need. However, I didn't know whether it was a man or a woman, and instinctively, the other part of me told me to keep walking, because this person could potentially be dangerous. And so, I kept walking, and I neared the intersection that I had to cross to get to the plaza. I pressed the pedestrian crosswalk button. The light turned to the 'person walking', signaling to me cross, but I didn't. My feet wouldn't budge. The part of me that wanted to offer assistance told me to stop and wait for that person, and I did. Few seconds later, the person on crutches approached very slowly. This person was a woman, and she had a cast on her left leg. As she neared closer, I saw that she had a black eye on her left eye. I asked her, ""Do you need any help?"". I forgot her specific words, but she said she had to get to this city where her friend lives. I asked her, ""How far is it?"" without contemplating whether or not if I was really going to give her a ride. You see, when the goodness of your heart eclipses other thoughts and feelings, you just want to help in anyway you can. I know giving a stranger a ride is dangerous, but I didn't think about that. I just wanted to help this desolate woman, because at the pace she was going, she wasn't going to get anywhere. She told me that it was an hour away. I told her that I couldn't help her and that I was sorry. She then asked me if she could borrow my phone; she wanted to call her friend and say that she wasn't going to be able to make it. After using my phone, she thanked me and walked away. I wanted to give her some money, but I had no cash on me. I felt so useless... I just wished her a goodnight, and I told her that I was sorry because I wasn't able to help her as much. So, feeling useless and pathetic, I walked to my car. I sat in my car wishing that I could help her. Then I remembered, I had money. Just a week before, my mom opened up a bank account and a debit card for me to use in college. She explicably told me to not to use it. So, I called her trying to get permission if I could; I called 3 times, but she never picked up. So I said, ""Fuck it"". I grabbed my card and ran to the nearest fast food restaurant, which was Del Taco. I ordered the first meal I saw and waited. And as I waited, I looked out the window to search where she had went; she was sitting on the bus bench. Now, this part really hurt me a lot. When I was searching for her through the window, the people around me were eating, laughing, smiling, talking, having a good time with their friends in the comfort of a warm indoor place, and this woman was outside alone in cold and was probably very hungry. When I received the food, I quickly ran outside and across the street to give her the food. I couldn't wait for the light to give me a go. When I gave her the food, she smiled and thanked me. I told her that I didn't have any money, but I had a credit card. I humorously told her that I wasn't suppose to use it. She didn't laugh; I could tell that she was very tired and weary, but she smiled. It was the kind of smile you wear when you are sad, but somehow, your friend cheers you up. The smile of appreciation. I extended my hand for a handshake and wished her a good night and a safe journey. I ended up grinning all the way home. And as I was going home, I couldn't help but think, ""What if I just crossed the street without waiting for her?"". I'm very happy I did stop. I still have the receipt from Del Taco; I'm going to cherish this moment and remind myself to do more good deeds.",,False,self,t5_2rl0v,1361525577.0,,,True,t3_190hyp,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/190hyp/today_i_bought_a_homeless_woman_food/,

I slammed on my brakes to avoid running him over and looked up at the light again to re-verify the light was green for me, checked that the sign showed the big red hand for him then looked back at him. I was dumbfounded so I honked. He then walked slower, yelling at me and tried to start a fight with me in no uncertain terms. Eventually I could inch my car around him and drove off infuriated. I could not believe how someone could be so rude as to completely ignore obvious traffic safety laws and then get mad at me for honking or just being there or something. 
I drove to get coffee thinking that the world was just a shitty place and everyone was mean. When I placed my order the people at the coffee shop told me that the car in front of me had paid for my order. I was dumbfounded. I heard these things have happened but never to me. The car in front of me wasn't that nice, they probably struggled with money just like I do. It was a huge gesture. I looked around hoping they were still there but the car was gone.

I first find the manager and give them a rave review about her and then I tipped her a big chuck and wrote a note saying that she does well at the job.

Now here is a tip for an easy RAOK whether you are at McDonalds or a Fancy 5 star restaurant one thing to do is if your waiter/waitress did a good job or even just an average job what you can do is either ask them to get the manager or when leaving ask someone else to talk to a manager or call in.

I wont be able to celebrate this year because of my work, but a few beers wont hurt. So as I shopped I remembered that the man on the parking loot wont have any celebration either, feeling generous I bought some extra beer for him as well and gifted it to him when I got home just now.

My name is Nicole and I am hoping for a kind person or people to help me with a gift for my mom.

This May mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, each month has been hell for her and for us. I am thankful she is still with us to be honest, the  doctor didn't have much hope for us at all.

In three weeks she will go in for a scan to see if her new chemotherapy treatments are working.

We have been told that there is no cure for this cancer, only ways of trying to slow down its progress..each night when i go to bed i am afraid something will happen to her and I try to stay awake until morning when she wakes up, you could say it's crazy but it helps me cope.

Money has been so damn tight, and I am certain there are people who will say that we could be saving more, but we have no frills, never go out and keep most of the lights off in the house, showers are limited to 4 minutes per person, except mom because we want her to take her time...this has dropped our water heating bill about 10 bucks.

Anyway to make a very long and tiring story a bit shorter I need a small birthday gift for mom, i was thinking flowers or dinner for her and dad,,but anything would be amazing

and lotsa cards..I want to see her smile and be happy, she is so strong and tries to be strong even when shes so worn out..moms name is Mercy and if anyone would and or could help me out I would be grateful.

Thank you for taking the time to read this

I get a to go box, put my three slices in and hand the box to him.

""We're all human.""

After the movie, walking back to the car, I notice a Red Robin across the street. Now don't get me wrong.. but I don't know many people who *actually* enjoy Red Robin, but we decided to go; this past Christmas, a distant step-relative gave me a completely random $25 gift card there, so I thought that we might as well. We go in, order some food, and have a generally decent time; we ordered a lemonade, a milkshake, some fries, and some chicken wings. When our waiter gives us the check, it's (to our surprise) only $14 or so dollars... turns out, the waiter only charged us for the milkshake and the wings. Now, I'm not sure if this was a simple mistake, but I thought that is was a positive thing either way. When it comes time to sign and tip our waiter, I tipped him the rest of the gift card, which was about $11, and write him a short note on the back explaining where the gift card came from, why I probably wouldn't use it again, and telling him to have a nice night. I know it wasn't anything incredible, but it left me feeling happy.. (plus, that's probably more than an hour's pay for him).

**TL;DR:** Distant step-relative gave me a $25 Red Robin gift card for Christmas, randomly went there this weekend with my girlfriend, waiter (not sure if by mistake) only charged us for half of the food we got, so I tipped him the $11 left on the card, wrote a little note on the receipt, and left without a trace. :)",,False,self,t5_2rl0v,False,,,True,t3_16z7bt,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/16z7bt/my_date_night_this_weekend/,

The Children's Tumor Foundation is the world's largest non-government organization dedicated to ending Neurofibromatosis (NF) through research. NF is a genetic disorder, usually manifesting during adolescence, that causes tumors to grow on nerves throughout the body, causing blindness, deafness, learning disabilities and severe chronic pain.

Three of them are also blind and one of the children needs a heart transplant.  Their position in Syria is very tenuous, especially following the recent destruction of their home in a suicide bombing in the area.

Short story is that I recently had my camera stolen, which I'm sure happens all the time, but it was literally the one nice thing I own. I'm 24, live in NYC and have moved something like 12 times in 5 years. In doing so, I've purged basically any furniture or tangible thing that I had to my name. About a year ago my photography habit was becoming too expensive to support shooting film, so I sold my medium format film camera and put whatever money I got towards buying a Canon 5d MKII. It's a fairly expensive camera, and I skimped out by getting a nifty 50mm lens that only cost me $100, but the camera body still put me into a bit of debt. Fast forward to a week ago, and I had the camera stolen while I was celebrating a friend's birthday. I've been browsing craigslist to see if anyone is trying to sell it, contacted used camera shops around town and have filed a report, but I have little hope of it coming back to me. While I don't support myself with photography alone, it is a second source of income for me that is now gone, save for renting a camera every time I have a job, or putting myself further into debt as I haven't yet fully paid for the first camera. I know this is a bit of a steep request, but I would gladly do any sort of community service work to make up for the kind gesture.

I'm not entirely sure how this works, but I was referred here by a fellow redditor after they had heard what happened, so I figured I'd share the story and see what kind of response I get. I know that the chances of one person donating such things are likely slim, but I would be open to going the kick-starter route and offering some sort of incentive/kick-back for whoever donates towards replacing my camera. Thanks to everyone in advance, if anything just for reading, I've never had anything stolen from me before, and I can say it's one of the worst feelings I've ever had, especially considering it leaves me with nothing to my name besides a few books, some clothes and the bed that I sleep on.

Well, really, that's the only rule I have. What you need to do to get this system:

Write a reply to this post. Upvotes / downvotes have nothing to do with my selection. I will read them all, and I will make my decision based on what I read. I want the Wii to go somewhere it will be used and appreciated. So, tell me what you want to do with the Wii. Tell me who would use it. Tell me if you know someone who it could really help in some sort of way.

There you have it. I look forward to reading your replies! 

Oh! Here is what comes with this:

(1) Black Nintendo Wii - This is the console and all required cords.
(1) Black Wii Mote w/ Nunchuck
(1) White Wii Mote w/ Nunchuck
(1) Copy of Kirby's Epic Yarn
(1) Copy of Super Paper Mario
(1) Copy of Wii Play
(1) Copy of Lego Batman
(1) Copy of Disney Epic Mickey
(1) Copy of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess

TL;DR - I'm giving a Wii. Tell me why you want it. Live in US. Be 16 or under (who receives it). You might just get it.

I'm not an experienced redditor apparently :D 

We're The Whole Scoop, a mom and pop ice cream store opening up in Newhall, CA. It's about 20 minutes north of LA right near Six Flags Magic Mountain. For the past 3 years we have worked tirelessly to develop our own ice cream recipes from scratch. We will serve an all-natural ice cream that is ""homemade"" daily in our store with nothing but natural ingredients (save a few flavors). EVERYTHING a customer gets in their hands is biodegradable and our store is built around a concept of no waste.

For the past 3 years we've sunk our life savings in to building the brand, concept, recipes, equipment and testing. There is nothing else out here like this and this first store is our prototype for future expansion. Our other company is a web development firm, so being in the industry we thought one creative way of financing the construction of the shop would be through a Kickstarter campaign.

We just launched our Kickstarter late last week and we're working tirelessly to get the word out. Even more importantly, if you love ice cream or like to support new businesses who bring quality food with a skew towards social and environmental responsibility, please check out our Kickstarter campaign. We have rewards starting as low as $5 and we will even ship ice cream to non-local backers. Any support, large or small, we are extremely grateful for.

If nothing else, please like us on Facebook, share our Kickstarter post or share our story with some friends. We're doing everything we can to get this store open.

Thank you Reddit!

He loves super heroes/villains, fictional characters, legos and well most things that 7 year old boys like. oh and He loves music and ""rock and roll"" as well and is very into music and such... 

I only ask because he has been emotional for the last few months due to his biological father not making visitations like he should be....and it hurts him to see that his bio-father has not a lot of interest in him, as well as he is being bullied in school to what seems no end and the school not taking it seriously. 

We would even be willing to send a photo of the placed art in his room with him, so that you can see the happiness that he finds in your work.

My son asked for new reels for his 3D Viewfinder. While getting groceries at Fred Meyer, I stopped by the toy section. The shelf was pretty empty, so like always, I started looking for runaways (that last toy that may have fallen behind the shelf). My success rate with this strategy is about 90% - I almost always find sold out items in the back or dropped below the shelf.

Lo and behold, I found a few reels that had fallen behind the shelf AND this mysterious envelope labeled ""Look Inside...""

""Oh no!"" I thought to myself. ""Some poor little kid left a Christmas card here!""

Reality sinks in. ""Wait, why would the envelope still be sealed? And how did it get hidden behind this shelf? Perhaps I stumbled upon a scavenger hunt!""

I open the letter and instantly know that it's a surprise, meant for a stranger like me! I feel like I don't deserve it - certainly there is someone who is more deserving than myself - I live a simple, happy life and don't ask for much!

Then the letter strikes me - ""buy a gift for your child"" ... bingo! That's what I came here for - the gift is just enough to cover a few reels for my son!

As I walk to the checkout, I immediately start pondering how I can pay this forward.

""What if I slip one of these 5's in a stranger's cart?""

""That elderly customer could probably use this more than myself. I'm going to slyly drop a $5 bill in her cart as I walk by."" She walks between me and her cart. ""Nooo! I just wanted to anonymously help you!""

I keep thinking about how I can immediately pay this forward.

""I've got it! At the checkout, I'll give the cashier this envelope with the cash and tell her to give it to her next customer, as a gift.""

I check out. I give the cashier the envelope. She informs me that it is store policy to not do this and if I give it to her, she will immediately have to turn it in to lost and found. ""?!?!?!?!""

I take my envelope back, use the cash for the purchase, and continue thinking....

""That's it! I'm going to pay this forward in the same way it was paid to me - I'll leave a few cash-filled anonymous letters in public places in 2013!""

As I said, struck by Random Act of Kindness :)

Secret santa, please PM me if you see this. I'd love to thank you personally!

**EDIT** ... I wanted to add something humorous. Just the day before I found this envelope, I was at a Target checkout. I had a couple of $10 gift cards and saw a person behind me buying what looked like the bare essentials for life. No games, no junkfood ... just milk, cheese, cat food, cat litter, and a loaf of bread. (while I didn't know this individual on a personal level, out paths had crossed once before when he was an employee and I was his customer at a large electronics store). I gave the cashier one of my gift cards and said ""Please anonymously apply this to the next customer's purchase."" I find it humorous that it took merely 24 hours for that $10 to find its way back to me :) A fine example of karma for those who believe in that!

I've been in many relationships, but this is the only time I have ever been in love. She has a 7 year old daughter who I love like my own child. We moved in together 8 months ago, and it was awful.

We've been together 8 years and both suffer from GAD and agoraphobia, as well as me suffering from a degenerative muscle disease, our friends mom offered to let us stay with her for a while until we got on our feet which was great and we kindly thanked her.

But we had no idea she had a roach/flea problem. And it was bad, we paid out of pocket for the first (and only) treatment and for a while things were ""okish"" but it wasn't enough and we can't afford anymore. I had a job working from home (it was legit) and just got canned because they didn't need me anymore.

We've tried asking for help from churches, family, you name it and nobody can offer us any help aside from a tough love approach because they don't believe we're actually suffering from anything. For the first 2 years of this illness we couldn't even drive a car (we were in a car accident, not terrible just run off the road, which led to our eventual panic/anxiety about driving) we barely left the house in fact we had black plastic bags over the windows for the longest time. 

Our friends did our shopping for us, and we basically were just hermits, we're finally getting back on our feet but this situation is putting us in danger. It's toxic, and abusive. We need help getting out, but our car died, just died on us. We had plans to leave the 21st of Dec but those are now delayed because of the car.

We've tried shelters, and programs with 2 year waiting lists. We can't do trains or planes because of our conditions, and we are just stuck here waiting for some miracle to happen.

My birthday is the 23rd of this month, and I just want to be happy and free from this atmosphere and be able to cope with things on a normal level.

Her mother won't stand up for her and her real father is dead. Her step father calls her many names that are not appropriate and has never accepted her as one of his own. When she moved out with our help, she left behind all that she couldn't take... her clothes.. her dog... her nail polish.. well hell all that wasn't in the small dufflebag and her backpack had to have been left and hopefully gotten later.... Well to our dismay her older step-sister came to visit .. trashed her room, took her clothes, and yes.. even dumped out all her nail polish and ransacked anything else she didn't want!!!... 

She has been really ill with ovarian cysts... (they believe it is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) .. and she is like a pretty tomboy! who loves to fish, hunt, work on cars and do all kinds of things but have her nails done pretty.. and have as nice of clothes as she can... 

On top of all this her boyfriend of two years mother just had a stroke at the age of 34... her boyfriend was just diagnosed with heart problems, his sister who is 13 has terminal cancer and is in and out of the children's hospital... and she is helping them when they need help by helping with dinner and whatnot.. 

 August 21 is her birthday and I want her to know that she is loved.. that she is strong for leaving an abusive situation.. That she is strong for helping this family in need (her boyfriends).... and even more awesome for continuing school -- she wants to be a Doctor!! I was wondering Reddit Laquerista's if any of you may have some polish or nail stuff to spare... or what I may go about buying so that she may keep pretty and strong in this situation... I haven't made an Amazon wish list as of yet as I am trying to keep her not knowing what I am doing.. She is a size 4 in most clothes, and a size 8/9 in women's shoes...I know some stores she likes to shop...  .. as I am not sure what to get her.... Any help would be so amazingly awesome!!

Take a few dollars if you have them and purchase some supplies to donate to local schools. Many states have tax-free holidays coming up and in conjunction with back to school sales, it's possible to make a big difference for these hardworking teachers with only $5 worth of supplies. Teachers are putting in more and more of their own money each year to be able to teach and care for our nation's children. That makes their jobs stressful and creates an unfair financial burden on them. 

Help lighten their load and ask others to do the same. Share a tweet, FB status, email, text, etc. Many retailers set up displays with supply lists for local schools. Even if there aren't any, just about any school can use pencils, pens, hand sanitizer, paper towels, tissues, colored pencils, markers, scissors... 

So skip that Starbucks run today and show your community you care by sharing whatever you can! 

Alternatively (or additionally), you can always ""adopt"" the school supply list from a struggling parent. I was able to cover five children last year on about $65 for two single moms. It makes me feel great, helps them out, and is fun to scour the sales papers for the best back to school prices!

Well not almost anything, but a lot of stuff. My uncle (who is a private pilot) and I were getting ready to fly back home from vacation. On take off, the throttle comes off in his hand. (Thats not good, FYI) The airplane wanted to go wide open, so we had to fly back holding the throttle back for 2 hours. to land we had to turn the plane off due to the fact there was no way to slow it down. My uncle kept his car in the hanger, and going to start it, it stank horribly and the exhaust was thick as hell. The car was acting sluggishly, and none of the electrical system worked. We figured we could at least get home the back way, but upon leaving the airport, we could tell the car wasn't going to make it, so we turned around and headed back to the airport. The car was going about 4 mph, and because the electrical system didn't work, we couldn't turn the emergency flashers on. We had one little uphill stretch to go to make the turn into the airport, and that's when the car stopped. The whole damn thing shut down. People were honking and hollering at us, but we couldn't get the car off the road due to steep banks on each side of the road. And then some dude gets out of the car behind us and comes up and says he can try to push it. Keep in mind that this is a large heavy luxury lexus, and its uphill. so we try to push it, and we actually get the thing moving. We got the car kind of slanted pointing into someones driveway entrance, but there was a lip that we couldn't get it over to get the car completely out of the road. We had to really push that thing, and finally we got it out of the road. We paid the guy 20 bucks for his trouble.

He lives in a trailer park and I switch between weeks of being with him and my mother (half custody in divorce). He usually lies awake for awhile because of a work related back injury that put him in that trailer park. I was in the shower and we both hear an incredible banging sound. My dad looks around in the back yard and I wrote it off as thunder . On our corner about 200 yards away is a liquor store. My dad looks over the fence and sees two people in a struggle and he hears a womans voice screaming at the top of her lungs (it was later found that the boom was her being thrown into those big metal electrical boxes). My dad throws on clothes as quickly as possible, hops in his truck, and rushes over there. My dad pulls up and flashes his headlights on him. The man doesn't stop. My father gets out of his truck and tells him to get off, When he doesn't he moves in closer. He tells him again and he still says no. My dad asks a third time and the continues and my dad gets him in a chokehold and squeezes. The lady who was being attacked ran the second my dad picked him up. The guy shoots his arms out and croaks ""Okay okay!"" When my dad started to apply more pressure. My dad sat him down and saw another guy running from the street. My dad thought he was going to have to fight two guys at once but the man came to help my dad pin down the attacker while they call the cops.

It is a pretty horrible job with horrible pay where I have to wake up at the ass crack of dawn to deal with some grouchy customers. I always put on a happy face and deal with it though. I just got a new job and my last day at the gas station is Friday.

Now every morning, this little old lady comes in and buys a large coffee and a few scratch off tickets. She has always been so nice and so I started charging her for smalls instead of larges. After she noticed that, she started giving me little tips. A scratch off one day, a dollar the next. It was nice and always made me smile. It was never about the money, as one dollar isn't an amazing gift or anything, but it helps and I really appreciate the thought. 

Yesterday, I told her that I was leaving the gas station and that my last day is on Friday. She gave me $25 and told me that I was so nice and helpful and etc. I tried to refuse it, but she wouldn't take no for an answer. I'm really hurting for money right now (hence the new job) and I really did need the money, so I used it and bought some gas. I have about $10 of it leftover and I want to do something nice for her tomorrow when she comes in for her coffee. Nothing big, and I know she won't take the money back, but something to show her that I really appreciated her kindness.

Could someone here help me think of something to do? I don't know anything about her. What would be a universally, cheap, and effective way to repay this kindness? Sorry if that's not something this subreddit is for, I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask though.

Has anyone been in any kind of these situations?
Did you speak up? Did you let it slide? 
What would you do if this happened to you? What would you expect people to do?


Edited: I thought I should probably add one of my own stories.


I work at a fairly busy Grocery store. I don't work for the store just in it. I've haven't seen any abuse like these videos but I've seen my fair share of homeless people bumming money, People wondering in drunk ect. With most of these people I'm polite but sturn. No one like a homeless person walking around in the dark in the parking lot spooking people asking for money. The neighborhood I'm in is fair amount of low income housing and older people. This is where I get split up. I would gladly hand a homeless person a giftcard or a drink or water or buy him something to drink, bus tickets stuff like that but I never hand out change or cash. The thing with the place I work at is these people often come around at after dusk and are normally intoxicated. I don't like when the spook people in the dark and I don't like it when they harass people I normally ask them to leave.


On the flip side I've gladly called cabs for people who've asked. Gotten chairs for people and even one lady the Special needs bus either wasn't on time or she forgot to give them the correct time I arranged for someone from that company to pick her up. I always think when it is an older lady would someone do the same for my grand mother. This is always my response when someone asked why I help I would want someone to do the same for her if she needed help from a stranger.

Basically here's the gist, I'm not too familiar with this subreddit, so If'n you need more, I'll gladly oblige.

I've recently become an uncle to a kick-ass 9 year old kid who, as though he were after my own heart, loves transformers. His mom and Dad (my brother) are not really the kind of adults who understand toys (they're car people), and so it's been up to me to funnel him in cool toys when I can. I've been giving him, and he's been LOVING, all my old transformers. But I've got a finite supply, and he's got an insatiable imagination. So here is what would be really cool of you guys:

If you have any old, non-collectors items (obviously) but still working transformers, I'd like to send them to him in one big go for his birthday (which was two days ago, and for which he got my optimal Optimus Transmetal), to send to him. 

He's an amazing kid and, although only recently aded to my family, means the damn world to me. If I could afford to send more then my dwindling stash, I certainly would. 

I can post the address here, but I'm not sure if I am allowed to.

Having an extremely rough month due to a few insane healthcare bills, so much so that I can barely keep food on my table.  I posted over at foodpantry, and an angel over there has helped out.

I am asking for some help from you guys to help me with my daughter's daycare...it would help more than you guys could truly understand.

I created a chipin page, and set it at $780, but only because that is a month of her daycare.  Honestly, every single penny helps.

If you can help, I appreciate it SO much, and please let me know that you have so I can properly thank you.  If you can't, I still thank you for the time you took to read this.

So much love, Reddit.  So much love.

She is an amazing woman who had many down days while doing an aggressive chemo treatment for a year. She is done for now and cancer free.

Whatever, ill try anyway. I send an email, dont get a response to quick, but she responds asking if i need just two. I told her yes and she tell me shell send this in a minute. Half an hr later i get a emailed asking if we had received them. No, they hadnt come through. Here it is, they will ask me to go to some site to get them or some other bs. damn... Wait what is this? two minutes later get an email from someoned actual email (not craigslist address) with the two tickets attached.

After retiring, my grandparents decided to give back to their community. My grandmother is very caring and detail oriented and my grandpa is a supremely skilled handyman. They both volunteer with their local emergency services, ASPCA, and Habitat for Humanity to name a few.  After 8 years of building homes for families, my grandpa fell from a roof breaking several vertebrae and losing function below his waist just two months ago. If you are familiar with paraplegia, you know that losing the ability to walk is the least of our worries. Things like blood clots,muscle atrophy,  and blood flow issues associated with paraplegia are at the top of our list. 
My grandparents, being the loving people that they are, took care of my great grandparents for many years instead of putting them in a hospice. That being said, the inside of their house is very wheelchair friendly. However, their backyard is a steep slope and obviously this is one renovation my grandpa won't be able to help with. Their favorite TV network, HGTV has a contest for home related renovations. They determine the winner by the number of unique site visitors. So reddit, will you help me and click the link?

Both of my two jobs, which brought in a substantial income, were phased out I was left to care for myself and my son â who has autism â on a fixed, social security income.  In addition, I was doing what little I could to help my grown children, who were also struggling.
It is probably comical to watch me in the grocery store, comparing the best value of the items I need, adding up the total as I go along so that I donât exceed the twenty or thirty dollars I have that week.  Jobs are hard to come by here, and an older woman with arthritic knees who is mostly deaf is not in a great position to snag what few job openings there may be.
So I pinch and scrimp and actually am occasionally hungry so that I could pay a bill.  I wished each day that things were different.  That, like Willy Wonka, I would find a winning ticket.  Or perhaps a comfortably off gentleman would fall madly in love with me, and I, him.  I hoped and I prayed that someday soon, something would happen and things would get better.
And then things got tough.  	
One of my daughters almost lost her life in childbirth.  Only a few months later, she was in a car crash, trying to avoid a baby bear cub crossing the road.  Her four year old son took a tumble from a kitchen chair and broke his collar bone, which is now refusing to heal.  Her husband fears that the company he works for may close.
Another daughter keeps getting recurring pneumonia and other respiratory problems as well as swelling of the lining surrounding the heart.  She was tested for everything under the sun, including Lupus, and the doctors still donât know exactly what is wrong.
One grown son found out he has glaucoma.  Another might need his gall bladder removed.
And now pinching and scrimping and worrying about getting the bills paid looks pretty good.  And if I donât get a winning ticket, or fall in love, itâs ok.  Just let my family be well, just let me be poor.
It *is* getting better.  The daughter who almost died in childbirth, who crashed, whose son broke his collar bone is strong and competent and is dealing with each piece as it comes along.  There are hard days but she is amazing.
My other daughter has still not been diagnosed, but is on a special diet which is helping her symptoms immensely.  She seems to be getting a little better day by day and it is beautiful to see.
My sons are managing their ailments well.
I still add things up in the grocery store as I go along and it is still hard to pay bills.  But itâs ok.  The important things are getting better.  And I am so grateful to just be poor.

Problem: Powers up but screen remains black (after LED flash). Likely a burnt out GPU, but honestly I do not know for sure.

Some back-story: The same problem occurred approximately 1.5yrs ago. I sent it back to the manufacturer (iBuypower), they said they replaced the video card, I got it back and it worked great for about a year then the exact same thing happened. Called iBuypower, they said it was now too old to be shipped to them (SC to CA) and refused to repair it. I took it to a local shop and they diagnosed it as a problem with some component of the motherboard. They had to ship it out of state for the repair because they didn't do that kind of work in their shop. Got it back (after like 2 months...) and it worked for a month, then BAM, same problem. Took it back to them, they then diagnosed the problem as the backlighting, they replaced that, got it back and it worked for ONE fucking day. By this time I had moved back to my parents (had just graduated) and after being basically passed off and ignored (by phone) I just said fuck it and decided to cut my losses -- because it was obvious they had taken advantage of my limited knowledge of laptop hardware and squeezed time and a few hundred dollars out of me.

Anyways, I would appreciate any info regarding this problem (either what it is, or possible home-based remedies). At this point I'm mostly looking to either 1) continue to pursue repairs locally or nationally or 2) save for a new comp (probably a desktop this time, heh) based on the information/feedback I get from you guys.

Other, likely useless, specs:
15.4"" NB WXGA+ 1440X900 8600GT 512M
Intel Core 2 Duo T7500 [2.2G/4M/800]
[NB] Mushkin 2GB DDR2-667 SODimm
2x 9-cell Battery
MS Windows Vista Premium Royalty
MS Office 2007

Thanks in advance reddit :)

UPDATE: so I found this guide for the exact problem I'm having. How to take apart the laptop and everything so get down to the GPU, removing/reinstalling it properly (cleaning/reapplying thermal compound), and how to execute the 'solder reflow' technique (aka, baking your graphics card in the oven).

This was my first time tinkering with laptop repairs but the guide was very informative and it got me through the entire thing. Needless to say, it worked and I am posting this from my now working laptop!!!! :D

The following is the link to the guide if anyone else with a Compal, model FL90 (or anyone with an 8600GT 512MB video card, apparently the problem is fairly common with this card) is experience the same problem.

Hello everyone
I wasn't sure how to post this and where to do it, but I can see other people have done it here. 
I have written an pm and a email to all of those whom I have sent the address of my daughter to say thank you. 
Some have respond and some have not. 
So this is why I want to say thank you, they might see it here. 
I asked in a thread if anyone would send my daughter some post cards do Christmas for a little extra while I was in the hospital, and a lot of beautiful people wanted to help.
Some even went a step further and sent some beautiful gifts for her. 
This made her Christmas , a Christmas worth remembering. 
I was in the hospital, but was allowed to come home on the 24th (where we celebrate Christmas) but I collapsed and had to be brought back, and I kind of ruined Christmas for my daughter whom I promised I would be home. 
I asked my wife to show my daughter all the beautiful gifts and cards to my daughter while I was in the hospital, and so she did. 
And for those who have kids, you might know that sometimes the wrapping paper is taken off pretty quick, and was put in a pile with the rest of wrapping papers , which was kind of a mistake since I did not have the option to send a letter back to those who helped us out. 
I have sent everyone who I exchanged the addresses with a email trying to figure out who sent who, still missing some people. 
But I just wanted to let people know there is still hope for us all, hope for mankind. There is people out there who still believes in each other and have a strong and big heart. 
I can not say thank you enought for you all, as so I have written in the Pm's to you all. 
Thank you! I want to write a lot of fancy words and really tell you how I feel but it's hard when I don't know all of the English words. 
But I hope I have explained my gratitude to you all in the messages I sent you all. Thank you again, thank you. ",,False,self,t5_2rl0v,False,,,True,t3_16y1rg,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/16y1rg/thank_you_to_the_secret_santas_of_2012/,

I would really love to have my own account so we can play multiplayer together (I'm not tech savvy enough to torrent the game and fiddle around with the settings)

I'm a university student, and money is more tight then i wish it were, so I cant buy another copy to play multiplayer with him. I've even asked my parents (sheepishly) but they dont understand why anyone would pay for a game twice.

My best friend is a beautiful 20-going-on-21 year old woman living with her single mother, and two teenage brothers. When she was 12, her father left them for an affair he was having, and has since used a loophole to get out of paying child support for his kids' needs. At this point he's way over $100,000 behind, and it just stacks up every month. Over the years, they've traveled all across the US to live with friends and relatives to get by. She's one of those quality people that life has whittled down.

They usually just scrape by; her mother works all the time- on the weekends, overtime etc, while my friend works a minimum wage job and is the best employee there. Recently, the cost of living has just gone up and they aren't making ends meet. Presently, they have $15 to split until next Friday for gas, food, etc. I desperately want to help her, but I don't know how. A couple weeks ago, I gave her family all the canned food I had, as each of them would have a meal about once every other day. I pay for her meals whenever I can, but she feels very guilty always relying on me, and refuses often. I don't make much, I'm a college student like many here, and I hate to see her hard working family like this.

http://imgur.com/EDcND Here is a photo of us, she's on the left. She's terribly shy and hates when her photo's being taken. 

They no longer qualify for food stamps or low-income housing because of her employment, and they are stuck paying a high lease until June. She will likely have to move away to live with family/friends again.

Let me state this: I am not asking for money or gift cards.

My son has asked for 3 things for his birthday/Christmas. He wants Monster Jam's Avenger 1:64 scale, Monster Jam's El Torro Loco 1:64 scale, and Thomas &amp; Friends Waterfall Tunnel. 

I was able to find and purchase Avenger. However, I am unable to find El Torro Loco anywhere, and cannot afford the shipping fees to purchase online. I cannot afford the Thomas waterfall at all.

I'm 33, married, with two pre-school aged children - but I barely see any of them. My wife and I are both employed full time, and our kids spend a lot of their days in daycare.

I had plans. I've got a tidy little nest-egg ready to use as seed money in my own business venture - but I never have any time to actually advance my own goals. I've submitted all the paperwork to start my LLC, but I never have a chance to perform any actual business with it.

Since some time mid-childhood, I got it in my head that I was going to grow up and design tabletop games. I've designed quite a few card and board games, and was even employed as the game developer at a hobby-level toy company for two and a half years. Last year, I lost that job. I still don't know why, and the reasons they provided were contradictory.

They may have paid me a pittance, and they may have shot down my ideas left and right, but it was the last time I felt I was truly fulfilling my purpose in life. There wasn't any complaint about the quality of my work, and my last two projects have since proved to be bestsellers for the company.

My business plan was to take my nest-egg, and use it to put my years of game design and development to work for myself. I've got plenty of game ideas, and designing games comes as easily for me as breathing. At least, it did.

Now, though... My job eats the majority of my time. Our household financial situation requires both my own and my wife's income. I can't plan. I can't start anything. I can't design. I can't prototype. I can't playtest. I can't even reliably get the time to attend a local gaming group which meets weekly, *and openly playtests hobbyist designers' games.* What little time I have that isn't spent on work, driving to and from work, and sleep is spent on basic household chores and maintenance. I'm tired all the time. My job (IT-related - workflow varies) is the closest thing I get to a rest. I've had a total of four vacation days in the past year, and they were spent on things like medical appointments, packing, moving, and other chores - and yet, the HR department has been making noises that I've been taking too much time off.

I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that the only way I'll ever be able to chase my dream is to actively harm my family's financial security. I could quit my job and get things going, but if my first project didn't work, I would be sunk. My nest-egg is enough to cover one, maybe two projects tops, but I would have to generate revenue pretty quickly in order to sustain my current financial situation. If it didn't, I'd be hunting for a job with a sparse and unimpressive resume, aiming for a pay rate which is, frankly, more than I could reasonably expect based on my skill set.

And I'm noticing that, while I may have a lot of game ideas, they're just a waste of emotional energy if I can never do anything with them. What's the use of detailing a game's mechanics if the notes are just going to end up in the ""Notebook of Ideas I Never Get to Work On""?

And I'm realizing that, for all my eager, cool game ideas, no one ever really expressed any enthusiasm for one of my designs past the original playtesting stage.

And I'm catching myself in the middle of thinking of some new game mechanic or concept for a game, and I think, ""No, stop that. What are you ever going to do with it?""

So now, I'm a database admin at a company which increasingly believes that only programmers should have direct access to the database, with virtually no opportunity to spend time with my family or pursue my goals in life, surrounded by the detritus of more than 20 years of a hobby dedicated to studying, dissecting, and designing tabletop games - which, I'm starting to suspect, was an act of horribly misguided overconfidence. I'm miserable, and I can't even enjoy the hobby which used to provide some meager distraction from my job, because I have no confidence in my ability to turn it into anything worthwhile.

I know I've got it ridiculously good. I have a job, a wife and children who love me, and a financial safety net in the event of an emergency. Plenty of people have it *far* worse than me. Why should I be depressed that I can't follow my unrealistic, childish dream?

Rationally, I shouldn't - but I am. Game design was as fundamental a component of my sense of self as my taste in music, art, or literature. Now I can barely even enjoy *playing* games, one of my all-time favorite activities. I feel like I'm having an identity crisis.

tl;dr - I have it way too good, and I'm sad because I didn't get a pony.",,False,self,t5_2rl0v,False,,,True,t3_107rt3,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/107rt3/request_encouragement/,

Nothing will be in perfect shape, of course, as many of the books are getting up there in age, and a good bit of my music is found in the $1 section. Regardless, I hope you will enjoy it!

My dad works with the father-in-law/grandfather of the family that was killed.  Since the news hasn't yet released their names, I feel that it would be in poor taste to do so myself- as soon as I see an update on the news, I'll change the page to reflect that.  For now, Sam is the man's name.  He lost his son last year, and (obviously) has been crushed by that experience.  This is his other son's family, his wife and two children.  According to one article I read, the details are horrific.  http://www.sacbee.com/2012/07/30/4675557/3-killed-including-2-children.html
The family in the second vehicle, a mother and her three daughters, are all in critical condition.  
Since I have a tenuous connection to Sam's family, I thought it would be useful to try to raise money for everyone involved.  I'm not a redditor, though I do read the site on occasion.  I'm well-aware of the fact that sometimes big miracles happen on reddit, and thought I'd give it a go.  I know how tight a community reddit is, and how outsiders can be viewed, but I'm not asking for myself.  I think both families are going to need some serious financial help.  I'm also aware of the danger of fundraising scams, and how this particular post may appear (especially with my new reddit account).  I'm more than happy to answer any questions anyone may have, if that helps.  
The fund is here: http://www.giveforward.com/dowdyandfieldsfamilyfund if anyone has anything at all they would like to donate.  Any redditors who may be in a better position to post this to r/assistance would be absolutely wonderful.

Here is what my sister-in-law has to say:

""My Students: The students in our school want to learn science, and they want to learn it by doing experiments rather than just reading it in a book. This experiment is a great way to teach the atom by making sparklers.

The students in our school are considered to be the disadvantaged kids in the district. Sixty percent of our students are considered to be low socioeconomic status, and many of them have to take on extra jobs or watch younger siblings to help out their families. However, they are very motivated to learn and be successful in school. We have four full sections of chemistry next year, which is an elective science class.

My Project: Experiments are a great way to give students the ability to see chemistry in action. By creating sparklers, the students are able to identify the colors of metals and relate it to atomic structure. I use this activity rather than a normal flame test because students love Fireworks, and this is a great way to make the content relevant to their everyday world. We focus on electron movement and structure. This is by far one of the most interesting labs that I do. This will be my first year teaching at this high school, and there are no materials to support this lab. Please help me give these students a great way to explore the atom!

I feel that this project is important because the students will understand the importance of chemistry in their everyday lives. Fireworks is a great motivator and this experiment can be used to learn one of the most difficult concepts in Chemistry, atomic spectrum.""


My students need chemicals and glassware to be able to learn about Atomic Structure, through the creation of Sparklers.

My husband was home at the time and was the first to notice the fire. He rushed over and tried to help but the fire was too much.  He was able to retrieve the neighbors long hair dachshund and bring him to our house for saftey. We housed the dog for about three days before family members could come get him.  He was a very sweet dog but covered in fleas. Unfortunately the fleas got into the house to my two indoor kitties.  I didn't notice the fleas on them until about two weeks later.  I have treated them both twice with frontline which is helping but very expensive to maintain. Was thinking maybe someone had some coupons or old (not expired) meds they would be willing to part with. Below is a somewhat blurry pic of the dog (cats leash and harness, which went with him) he was very excited after the fire and wouldn't calm down. Also a link to the article speaking of the fire.

I have $600 saved up and a job interview with a bank if I can get back down there by Christmas.  I would probably need around $1200 more to be safe enough, paying rent and initial deposit.  I care deeply for her and the time apart has really taken it's toll on our relationship.

Ideally, I would like to get down there, find a room, go to my interviews and see her.  I plan a bouquet of roses and a note to have her meet me on the beach in Southern Florida.  There I will have a picnic and  candles set out to ask her to give me a chance again to turn things around for us, go to school and maintain a stable environment for us to live.  If possible maybe even have a plane write a special message in the sky for her, but one can only ask for so much.

She is the best thing that has ever happened to me, makes me feel like I can do anything, inspires me beyond words and I have taken her for granted.  I have one shot in my mind to make this right and if anyone would like to help me make this future happen, please... Donate to Love!

I went to the food store to stock up during my first week and the cashier was incredibly nice to me. I was disheveled and sad and he told me, in a non-creepy-at-all that I'm too pretty to be sad and that he knows I'll get through it. Sounds strange, but it really stuck with me and inspired me to be helpful with fellow shoppers, patient with screaming kids, and kind to cashiers, etc. 

Fast forward to today. I've since developed a rapport with another cashier, a woman. She is quirky and friendly and I like her a lot. She seemed downtrodden so I asked her what was wrong. In the most stoic way she could, she told me that she lost a baby (miscarriage) and she and her husband are having problems because of it. I nicely asked her all the appropriate questions as gently as possible and wished her the best, with a pat on the back before I left. She seemed genuinely touched and affected.

As I'm leaving, cashier from 3 years ago and today's cashier are hugging in the Starbucks in the food store. Odd. So I approach the woman to wish her well one more time before I went. Turns out, the 2 cashiers are husband and wife! 

Both have been so kind to me on so many occasions and genuinely seem like caring people. The man looked at me with familiarity, but didn't really recognize me - he might never know how his kindness affected me ever so long ago during my first otherwise bleak month in a strange place.... 

Just a reminder for me today that kindness matters, connections have meaning, and most people are just doing their thing. Have a great weekend, fellow acts-of-kindness-ers!

I am a first grade teacher in North Carolina and starting February, we will start reading the book Flat Stanley and discussing geography and other places around the world. My son gave me the idea that perhaps the great people here could help me with the project. 

Here is a picture of our beloved Flat Stanley.
http://imgur.com/Dtwzu
For those unfamiliar with the story, Stanley was alseep one night when a bulliten board fell and flattened him. Because he is now 2D, Flat Stanley can go places he never could before, by mailing himself. He visits all sorts of places from his mother and father's home to other countries. 

For this project, I was hoping people could print out the picture of Stanley above, either with yourself in the photo, or just something around that you find interesting, be it a popular place in town, or your cat's favorite sleeping spot. Once you take the picture, you can either post it in the comments below or email it to an e-mail we have created for the project (Or both!). Just include a small tidbit of where the picture was taken (so my students can map where he was and learn what was interesting about it).

The email for this project is FlatStanleyProject117@gmail.com.

Thanks again, Reddit!

My goal is to move back to the Pacific Northwest and find work once my savings goal has been met.

Part of my budget is $10/month for gifts and/or charity. I know, it's not much, but hear me out. Some people might argue that they spend that much each week at Starbucks. While that's probably true, it's $10 more per month than I spend at Starbucks. Or on beer. Or at restaurants. Or on clothes. Or on really anything other than saving for my move. So $10/month to me is a significant amount.

I would like to hear Reddit's recommendation on how I can make my $10/month significant to someone else. :)

He hopes to travel by rail, bus, and stranger in hopes of finding a new purpose and meaning for his life. His intention is to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. With enough funding, we are hoping to create a documentary of this journey.""*

I am not directly involved, but I saw this pop up on my Facebook after one of my former teachers and a fellow classmate of mine posted it.

------

Hi.
My name is Daniel I am 26 and I live in the UK. I am looking for a generous user that could potentially improve my quality of life.
3 Years ago just before my daughter was born I was taken ill while at work. It started out as a continuous headache that has never dissipated, everyday head pain with a few bad pain attacks per day have really degraded my life quality.

I can't sleep unless I have some form of white noise playing from the radio due to the unrelenting buzzing noise in my head. I struggle to wash the dishes due to chronic back pain which induces pain attacks. Long exposure to bright light induces major pain and pain attacks which all together makes me severely depressed.
My thoughts are very dark and I have considered ending the pain before now, my head really isnt in the correct place. I am incredibly forget full due to my problems and the weight I have gained is just stupid. Before I was taken ill I walked 5 miles to work and 5 miles back, if anything I weighed about 16st but now could be somewhere between 23-25st.

Over these 3 years I have taken several types of medication that I feel has ruined me over time. Topirimate, Naproxen, Dosulipin, Citalopram, Nadalol, Valproic acid, Lansoprazole and Rizatriptan. I think thats them all... At some point my last doctor in a House esque move asked me to take all these at the same time.
I did this for a week and became very ill. Subsequently I do not see this doctor nor visit this hospital any more.
I live on the UK a very limited income as I don't fully qualify to be labeled as sick as I do not have a name for this problem. My new doctor who is a specialist in neurology has seen me recently and has ""invited"" me to come stay in the hospital for a few weeks and from what I gather I will be subject to a lot of tests.
He thinks I have something called Cushings or Cluster Headaches. He has advised me to get a grip of my life and create some kind of order.
I have had a sit down and a bit of a cry with my Girlfriend and my daughters and devised some form of super plan.

If I get a modern type phone that I can manage my appointments, sleep diary/headache diary and reminders I think I may be able to get though the tough times.
Having a modern phone would help me sleep as I could use earphones for the white noise. I could use the calander without being on the pc. I could see photos of my family when I needed them, I could watch some tv if the phone was capable and I could keep in contact with my family using the phone as a phone!
At this present time I don't have a mobile as I am pretty much housebound. The last phone I had was an iphone4 but I had to sell the thing to make rent.
I would like to thank you just for taking the time to read this and I must apologize that my English is not on track due to my illness. I am here to answer any questions you should need to ask.

Thank you!

Daniel.

He's a Korean War veteran, member of the Wolfhounds and Purple Heart recipient, and an amazing Santa Claus lookalike! 

But his most amazing feat was his love for my aunt. They were married 58 years; years full of love and kindness for each other and an inspiration to our whole family. For the past several years he took care of my aunt as she fell victim to Alzheimers. Anyone that knows of the disease knows how terrible it can be, but he managed to keep my aunt at home and take care of her (with the help of a couple of my cousins and a couple of their kids).

She died last Sunday, and he is so sad. One of my cousins has asked for cards/notes of support to him. Just a quick note to let him know people care (and hey, if you want to mention his nephew Kwip is his best nephew, that's on you!). ;)

He's such an amazing person, and to see him broken like this is even more crushing than the loss of my aunt. My cousin (his daughter) hopes to break him out of this funk and inspire him to travel to Alaska, something he's always wanted to do, and now is ""free"" to do (as harsh as that might sound).

If you could just take a moment to send a note or card of support to Uncle Bill:

We have been in operation since 2005, but it is difficult to get money to put on a fundraiser as any corporations that donate put stipulations on their money that it can only go to paying specifically for flights for children (and nothing goes into our operating or fundraising budget). Anywho, [donation page](http://www.hopeflightfoundation.org/Donate.html) is on the site. I'd be happy to answer any questions.

You can also help in other ways... (e.g., one group sends us small stuffed animals as ""travel companions"" for the kids we fly, and some local restaurants give us dinner coupons to raffle off in fundraisers).

There are a handful that I talk to on the regular, the kind of people I go out of my way to say hello to. It's usually small talk and things going on during that particular time of year. 

I had mentioned that I got engaged a few weeks ago to this particular woman that comes in to our store regularly. This morning on my opening shift, she came in at around 7:20AM. We chatted briefly, I told her I might be moving into an apartment soon with my my fiancÃ©e. 
""What's her name?""
""It's ________""
She asked for the correct spelling and said that her daughter had the same name etc. We spoke until the next customers arrived and she was off.
10 mins go by and she came by again. 
""It's just a little something, congratulations! You've always been so nice and I wanted to get you guys something.""

I opened up the card after she left. It was an engagement card with a $50 bill inside. I was shocked. I was grateful but at the same time, I didn't know how to feel. I also felt a little guilty taking it. 

After a couple of minutes, I thought about how weird it was. I couldn't get the smile off my face, a random person that I had a work relationship with just dropped $50 to me. It was such kind gesture that I'm not used to seeing, especially where I work! She made my day!

As much as I love her and want to give her the world, I am forcing myself to come to terns that she will not have anything under the tree. And it beyond breaks my heart. My daughter is nothing short of awesome in so many ways. First and foremost, she is an excellent student (she is in the Gifted and Talented Program at her school). I have a somewhat chronic medical condition, and she wakes herself up at 5:30 am to make sure she is ready. She is kind, always the kid to make friends with the underdog at school and stand up to bullies. Because I've had to take time off work to address my medical issue, this year has been especially tough. We've done away with every possible luxury, and we are still falling behind on our bills bigtime- all of them, but I should be able to catch up with them with our income tax refund. Our car broke down numerous times and for finally for good, right along with our laptop, gaming system and tablet. Through all this, she has never complained, even as she watches her friends show off their latest clothes and gadgets. She wears her old shoes and stained coat without complaining. She deserves the world, and I can't even buy her new shoes and a coat. Thankfully, my health has improved. My employer of 6 years reduced my hours, but I have another part-time job scheduled to start in January. Things are looking up, but Christmas.... I am really bummed about this, though I try not to show it. How do I tell her? What do I say? We have no family. I'm college educated and work extremely hard; this wasn't supposed to happen. I'm too embarrassed to talk about this to any ""real"" people I know. I don't want them to think less of me. I can see how poverty can be so isolating so quickly.

------


I've never done this before, so if I am going about this the wrong way, please let me know.

This tale may be a touch long, so forgive my backstory.

My dad broke his foot about ten years ago.  He has diabetes, and part of that package is reduced sensation in his limbs, so he ended up walking around on it for nine months before going to see the doctor.  It didn't heal correctly, ultimately turned gangrenous, the infection got into the bone, and after multiple surgeries and attempts to correct this, he ended up losing the leg.

This severely depressed him, and he didn't even really try with the prosthetic.  The years stuck on crutches or a wheelchair, unable to work, had worn him down, and I think he basically just gave up.  About four years ago, maybe five, my mother left him.  She listed a lot of reasons (and I even sympathize with a few of them, my father is a lovely man, but he's not perfect), but the real reason she left, and we all know this, is because she didn't want to take care of him, or us (myself, and my two younger sibs).  She left fully expecting that without her help there, he would be dead in a handful of years, as opposed to the decade or more he would have held on with her.  She has told me as much before to my face and seemingly takes no shame in it.

My dad was wheelchair bound by this time, however, and he couldn't do easily for himself, especially considering how poorly my brother and sister treat him (god awful, and they're pigs to boot, they left rotting food just everywhere), so I stayed.  We couldn't afford a nurse or a helper, and SSI, while useful, wasn't enough.  We made just over the bare minimum for food stamps, yet couldn't afford food.

It was an awful stretch of years, and it shaped all of us... Badly.

The last year and a half, he began to treat me very poorly.  I won't go into the things that were said, because I know the source of that ugliness and it wasn't anything I will stand and blame him for, but about five months ago, matters game to a head, and I was forced to choose whether to stay and remain a doormat and the focus for abuse from both him and my brother (following in my 'lovely' mothers footsteps, abuse really does roll downhill), or go.

I made the hardest, and bravest decision of my life, and moved out.

That action was the straw that sent my entire family situation into a state of collapse.  Without my contribution to rent, my dad lost e apartment.  My sister went into a halfway house for her drinking and drugs (and has subsequently been kicked out of two of them). My brother is, amazingly, kicking both habits rather successfully, has a job, and is pulling through school.  He's also supporting my sister at the moment (my mother tells him to let her live on the street).

My dad, however, the one who I feel worst for, has ended up in his darkest nightmare, and is currently stuck in an assisted living facility.


Now, to get to the meet of the matter.

Every spare bit of money he has is going towards paying back bills he had to let slide in the past (mostly medical stuff), and towards pitching in to help keep my brother and sister fed while my brother pays rent on the apartment, and goes to school and works at the same time.  He is going absolutely stir crazy, and it is breaking my heart to watch.

Worst of all, as of a month from now, I will be moving out of state.  I've been struggling with my own fallout from my family situation, and I'm trying to let go of some of the fear and learn to live a bit of the life I put on hold so many years ago, so I'm moving in with my previously long distance boyfriend.

Good idea, bad idea, that's not really the point of this unfortunately long essay.  The thing is, I won't be in the area to keep him company, to talk to him, to offer a friendly face as the only family member he has left who isn't intent on manipulating him, or holds an excessive amount of hatred towards him.

In short, I am looking for a computer for him, and I am hoping against hope someone here can help me find a way to both keep him entertained and offer an intelligent, articulate, lively man a way to live outside the narrow, dirty room he is currently stuck in, as well as allowing me to keep in contact with him long distance.

The facility he is in does have wireless, but he is only allowed half an hour of computer access a day on the machine provided for the residents.  Ideally, he needs a laptop, but honestly, I'm sure we could find out a way to set up anything anyone felt fit to provide.

He does not need a high powered machine.  He mostly does YouTube, Netflix, and reads articles.


If anyone can help me, or knows of a way I could go about finding a computer for him (if you know of a program, for example, I could make use of), I would deeply appreciate the help and/or the information.

We live in LA, california.  If there is any information you need, please don't hesitate to PM.  If I have phrased this poorly, broken any of the rules of the forum, or if this would fit better in another place, again, please let me know.  I have no intention of offending, considering I am going out on a limb to seek help here.

Thank you for reading this, regardless of whether or not you can help me.

I would like to get straight to the point before I make my story.  I was wondering if anyone could gift me a steam game called âSettlers 7â?  This is my first time on reddit.  I am feeling downed so thatâs what overcame me to make the account.  Iâm already at my 5th year attending at a UC and my G.P.A remains a 2.4 as a Biology Major.  With a useless degree, I went through a lot trying to figure myself out.  I feel terrible because the first thing I felt that could keep me motiovated to look on the positive side of my life is to find a part time job just to feel productive.  But no one was willing to hire me, not even as a dish washer at a local fast food on craigelist, namely some asain cafe.  To be honest, Iâm not that bad of a person and I have done good deeds.  I was part of a sustainability club.  I help raise money and thought up a way to promote students to use bicycles and reuse water bottles.  For the bicycles, the idea was to have a self repair ramp on campus, where people can bring their bicycles and use the leasy accessible tools to repair bikes.  It was a nifty thing and it worked!  It kept students from using fueled cars and save money.  The water refill station was an awesome thing.  Very stylish and high tech.  It looks like a mini version of the gallon refills in front of the supermarkets like Food 4 Less.  This keeps students from ever  throwing away any more plastic bottles.  Iâve also joined a club thatâs against cancer.  Iâve raised funds through setting up event.  The money goes towards cancer research which I still believe today its highly needed.  And of course, I couldnât forget that namely Riverside has the most homeless and shadey people in the area.  But nonetheless I treat them as human beings, I greet them and do give spare change if I do have some, but when I donât Iâm honest about it.  

But what depresses me today is that I had finally had the guts to tell my girlfriend about my grades and my current state of my own future.  And she wasnât happy, she started ranting a lot of craziness before she stormed off to her place.  Before I told her I tried to make a wonderful atmosphere before I break it to her.  I surprised her with tickets for hunger games and took her to an awesome icecream parlor.  Well I tried to tell her that shit happens, but she couldnât swallow it yet.  I know it means a lot to her if I had a successful path,  but who knows Iâm trying my best to cope with the situation at hand.  So now Iâm just depressed about myself, I donât work as of now and am a poor college student.  Iâve already invested my lunch money on my girlfriend so I hope she will calm and sympathize with me tomorrow.  So Iâm just hopeing somebody could gift me settlers 7 so it could get my mind off things and make me a bit happier.  I appreciate that.

**Update**: I take the detail back about having a girlfriend.  I no longer have a girlfriend.  She dumped me because she wanted to ""establish her life with someone who can make money"".  It doesn't really helped that during the course of finals preparation, I got mugged and stripped by 3 guys and couldn't perform well on one of my finals...",,False,self,t5_2rl0v,True,,,True,t3_quwuj,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/quwuj/request_depressed_student_who_would_appreciate/,

I'm a lurker on a relatively new subreddit, /r/SongStems, where the stems (isolated tracks - drums, guitar, synth, vocals, strings, etc.) of songs are shared with other Redditors. [Here's a small example](https://soundcloud.com/unohoo09/classical-remix) of something I wrote using stems I found earlier today, hopefully demonstrating their usefulness.

I was just about to make an account on MediaFire to upload the stems that I've gathered over the past day (stems are difficult to come across - I had to visit obscure Russian media sharing sites to get the stems for one Linkin Park song), but then found out that [the maximum file limit for a free account on MediaFire only allows files up to 200 MB](https://www.mediafire.com/upgrade/) to be uploaded. This is an inconvenience to those that I'm trying to share the stems with, as I don't want to have to make them deal with waiting for a minute to download a file while Premium memberships are flashed in their face, a la RapidShare, or make them download multiple parts.

No stems I have are over 1 GB, so the Personal membership with MediaFire is exactly what I need.

I'm not sure how the account would be paid for, but my best guess is that whoever wants to help me would create the account with an email that I'd send via PM.

(Details Inside / Location: Nulato, Alaska)",pookie_roth,1,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/vqbm4/request_crosspost_im_trying_to_help_my_family/,"Good Evening, Redditors!

I'm cross-posting this from /r/Assistance.  My family and I are trying our best to get an online fundraiser started for my medically-challenged younger sister, who is due for a medical trip to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN the week of July 30th. Leslie is a 26-year-old Koyukon Athabascan/Tlingit from the village of [Nulato, Alaska](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nulato,_Alaska). Her home is located on the north bank of the Yukon River 325 air miles west from Fairbanks, Alaska.

This fund is specifically meant to help her cover the cost of round-trip airfare for both herself, and our mother, from Nulato to Rochester.

Leslie's list of medical diagnosis started with immune deficiency and autoimmune phenomena; she does not make her own antibodies. Today her list of medical diagnosis is thirteen long, which has rendered her legally and medically disabled. She can explain to you simple conditions like hypothyroidism, allergies or asthma, and more complicated health issues like low adrenal function or glutathione peroxidase deficiency because they are a part of her life. Since she was two years old she has had to make frequent trips to the nearest medical facility for [IVIG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IVIG) infusions. She also has numerous other health issues, with the most recent addition being Type 1 Diabetes, which in itself has set off her seizure disorder. This particular condition has negatively impacted her life; she has serious memory issues and uncontrolled temporal lobe seizures. So far, Leslie has had 50 surgeries due to varying complications from her health disorders. This upcoming trip is primarily due to her seizure disorder - her neurologist here in Alaska referred her to Mayo Clinic for an evaluation for brain surgery.

Leslie is an individual who is determined to persevere and overcome, regardless the nature of the challenges that she faces. She is altruistic at heart, and loves to spend her time volunteering in the local community.

She has amazing inner strength, and despite the odds, she is still here with us. We have helped her set up a donation website on GoFundMe.com - which is located [here](http://www.gofundme.com/leslie-ambrose). She's posted more information on that page - so please feel free to take a look. :) I've also created a small album on Imgur, of [Leslie and her service companion](http://imgur.com/a/laTxe) (with her permission, of course).

If anyone has any questions, please feel free to comment or PM me.

My husband and I paid cash for our home on the 6th of February but moving in was up and down and not so exciting since we lost so much financially having to assist with going back and forth for family over my grandmothers passing. Then we had our wedding on February 18th and were pushed around by three different companies over our housing that we reserved for the wedding weekend. In march my ex husband went to run a marathon after losing 120LBS and severred his right lower leg on an obstacle. We moved him in with us since he had no family. Then this week came...
Tuesday morning at about 5 AM my ex knocked on my bedroom door to tell me it was raining and that our roof was leaking. Keep in mind, I live in Arizona and rain is VERY unlikely. I jumped out of bed and went to look in my kitchen where said leak was and had not yet put in my contacts so I was soaked as if I walked into a monsoon. After immediately looking to see how bad it was raining I saw it was clear skied and no rain. I knew immediately that the water main needed to be shut off and ran out front to flip the knob up. Our house is very old but has been remodeled a lot and the only thing no one has changed is the piping. Needless to say, my house was completely flooded. I do have pictures and will post them as soon as I go back to the house tonight to get our camera. My husband and I have done so much to live a simple life, but this has torn up our life. I am in a hotel and the insurance company is only calling me to tell my the things they WILL NOT cover.
Apparently, the company we hired to do our initial inspection on the house before we bought it did not do a very good job. There is a massive mold issue in the kitchen behind the drywall. My oldest son has severe allergies and very bad asthma. I have to get these things fixed and have absolutely NOTHING to help us get our life back together. I am not asking for pity, I am asking if there are places or people that can help and anyone that is willing to help replace the cabinets or drywall...the most important part to me is that my kitchen is back together and the mold is gone so I can go home and take care of my children. I am going monday to put my wedding rings as collateral for a loan but am not able to get more than $2000.

EDIT: Went and took pictures but in all the mess cannot find the cable to get my pictures onto the computer. Good news for today is that my kids are finally back with us and we are trying to make it seem like a vacation for them...jumping on the hotel bed...FUN times!!!",,False,self,t5_2rl0v,1340415985.0,,,True,t3_vgqht,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/vgqht/request_kitchen_is_completely_demolished_from/,

A year ago I started on my lifelong goal of becoming a Midwife. I've served over 30 families in the last year, many I offer sliding scale services too as they couldn't afford my full fee's. 

I rely on my car for the entirety of my business and to function in daily life. Prenatal and Postpartum visits, traveling to the birth, plus the usual errand running. We are a one car family and my husband commutes over 30 miles a day via bicycle to work all year round. (yes, even when it's like tundra outside). 

After borrowing a family member's vehicle and being told cash monthly payments were about to be arranged for it's purchase, I recently found out that this plan isn't being honored and I am in need of a new car. 

This was sudden and unexpected for us and definitely not something we were prepared for financially. 

We are unable to afford financing through major dealerships and don't need anything brand new. Just safe and reliable so that I can focus on birthing and caring for my baby over the next year as well as caring for the dozens of women I serve annually. 

We are hoping someone has a car they've been holding onto for someone special. Maybe a parent or grandparent that is no longer driving has something sitting in the garage. Maybe someone is moving suddenly and wants to spread some good karma before they leave. Maybe the person that just won that 590 million dollar lotto decides to read this and help. Maybe you just want to send cash. Maybe you want to send us good vibes. Whatever it is you believe, just take a moment and help us manifest our need. 

I just don't want to be on the side of the road with a newborn on the way to another birth with a broken down car.

1362202408.0,0,self.randomactsofkindness,19id7o,Gary: A Case for Humanity,cloutissimo,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/19id7o/gary_a_case_for_humanity/,"Dear fellow Redditors,
 
I hope you take the time to read this story and what's more I hope you can take something from it.  You see every now and then something can happen to you that will really put just where you are in life into mind altering perspective.  For me that event happened today.
 
I got into the car business for one reason and one reason only: money.  I had a girlfriend with whom I wanted to raise a family and needed to make more money.  I had bills and student loans which I needed to be able to pay more securely.  I had physical wants that I was tired of denying myself.  And so I became a car salesman and my financial status quickly grew.  I am now happily engaged to that wonderful girl.  My bills are right on track.  I drive a luxury sport sedan and so on and so forth.  But today all of that truly got wiped from my vision when I stumbled upon Gary.
 
Gary is an old man.  That's the best way I know how to describe him.  I first spotted him on my showroom floor yesterday, the last day of February 2013.  He was concluding a meeting with another salesperson and I remembered as I passed hearing him talk about how he had a TV he was going to sell and some other things in order to come up with a down payment for a new vehicle.  Gary drives an old Kia Rio and was trying to jump into an updated model but was on a very tight budget.  I remember thinking sarcastically, ""Oh sure you do, old man,"" as I continued walking and didn't think much of it.  After all I have other things I need to do so why give it a second thought?
 
This morning at 8:29 Gary was back on the showroom floor.  The salesman he had dealt with the previous day was not going to be in the office today and so one of our other sales people tended to Gary in his stead.  I kept walking to stock in my trades from the previous evening and by the time I got back Gary had left again.  I went about my day without thinking of it again.
 
The afternoon rolled around, about 4:15 I saw the tell-tale front of Gary's old Rio pulling into my lot once more.  My sales manager asked me to tend to whatever he wanted this time because the salesperson that helped him this morning had left to pick his daughter up from school.  Gary wandered into the office of the original salesperson with whom he had worked on Thursday to find that they still weren't in for the day.  He thanked the officemate for delivering the message to please contact him.  As he walked towards the door I stopped him.
 
""Sir, what can we help you with today?""  I asked.
 
""I need the number for an All-State agent, do you have one?""
 
A simple enough request, I am a car salesman and the local insurance agents are constantly cluttering my desks with their cards and gifts trying to get me to send my customers their way, this should be easy.  We get back to my office and I notice a few things.  Gary is wearing the same green shirt and jeans he was wearing yesterday.  His hair looked greasy and suffice it to say the odor about him suggested the man hadn't bathed in some time.
 
As it turned out I only had the card of a Farmers' agent and I informed Gary as such.
 
""Do they have the safe driver discount?""  he wondered aloud.
 
""Well, sir, to be honest most of the major carriers have a policy like that, they just call each program something different.""  An honest answer.
 
""Well now what should I do?""  He asked directed at me.
 
I told him I would look up the local agents' numbers for all four major carriers and he could shop their rates and pick what fit his needs the best.  I looked them all up in my smart phone, wrote them on my legal pad, tore it off and handed it to him along with the Farmers' agent's card I happened to have.
 
""Well, sir, I want to thank you for your courtesy and as a show of appreciation I want to offer you $300.00 in cash!  Just don't use it to buy cigarrettes.""  He actually said this.  I had no idea how to respond.  I chuckled.
 
""OK, deal!""  I said after quickly deducing he was must be kidding.
 
""Let me just go to my car and see if I have it.""  
 
I waited for what I thought to be the most obvious conclusion, that he wouldn't find any money and tell me he must have forgotten his wallet at the house or some similar story.  I stood patiently waiting, happy to entertain at this point when he turns around from the vehicle and produces a sizable wad of cash.  He hurriedly approached me with this disorganized bundle of new $100's and proceeded to try and hand me three of them to which I threw my hands up in protest and exclaimed, ""Sir, I cannot possibly accept any money from you!""
 
""Why not?""  He seemed puzzled, disappointed.
 
""Because all I did was give you four phone numbers, it's truly no big deal please keep your money.""  He was even more confused.
 
""I'm not paying you for the numbers.  I'm paying for your courtesy....isn't...isn't that what God wants?!""
 
I didn't know how to respond.  The question broke my heart.  
 
Finally after a moment that seemed an eternity I said, ""Sir I'm not at all a religious man, but if there is a God I bet he would want me to be nice to you whether you had $300 or $3 million.""
 
I still don't think he understood why I didn't accept his money.
 
This whole scenario though truly shook me up.  I was very upset and had to take several moments to compose myself and try to make sense of how awful I felt for Gary.  To me there were basically two options.  Either Gary is an eccentric billionaire who just gives away money for good deeds or, far more likely Gary is an old lonely man, to whom the act of a stranger taking 10 minutes out of their day to sit down, chat, and help them is worth a very considerable portion of the money they have.
 
I don't think I'll ever see Gary again, but he will be remembered by me for a very long time.  I don't know why I am writing this down.  I don't know how many of you will reach the bottom of this story.  I guess it's in the hopes that maybe the next time you see someone in need of help, instead of deciding someone else will do it, like I did in the first stages of meeting Gary, you will step up and be that person.
 
Maybe it's a family with a hood popped and open in the grocery store parking lot, the father holding jumper cables hoping to find someone willing to offer their battery.  Maybe it's something as simple as seeing someone with a cardboard sign on the side of the road and actually making eye contact.  Maybe you don't have money to give, but say hello.  Imagine the shame and hopelessness of the situation before locking your door and muttering to yourself about the need for them to get a job or kick their addictions or what have you.
 
I guess what I learned today is that sometimes, a few minutes is all it takes to really help someone.  My hope is that the next time you find yourself face to face with your Gary, you don't wait as long as I did to stand up and be the person your parents would be proud of.
 
Thanks for listening.

I was elated to have them, I loved them on the original xbox and was hoping to play them again to rekindle a little of that nostalgia.

  I sat down and put them in my 360, expecting to finally be able to play them again years after my original went 'kaput'. The disappointment I felt when I got that error message was almost palpable. It told me that it wasn't compatible, so I looked online, and apparently it is one of the many games that Microsoft decided didn't need to be made compatible with the new console and never will be (Seriously, horrible move.)
 
 I looked online to see if I could at least figure out the prices on an original so I could play these wonderful games instead of just selling them off, but even the cheapest ones I've found are outside of my spending-money range (Very broke, but at least I eat)

 So I'm coming here to ask one of you for an original xbox. I'm not going to say I need it, and I'm not going to tell you that without it my Holiday will be ruined, I was just disappointed that I couldn't play my favorite series from the last generation on my supposedly 'Advanced'  console, and I would really appreciate the act if one of you can spare it.

Not to be a downer but I was hoping maybe someone could pass me along Diablo 3, or maybe even just a guest pass, I really want to play it but I can't. Reason being;
My dad was always an asshole, up till early last year when I turned 17 and then mid-May we (Me, my mother, and my sister) moved out of the house because we were done with it. He was physically and mentally abusive, I wasn't allowed to go outside the house (literally, not allowed to go in the backyard or front yard, was locked in the house), was not allowed to watch TV, talk on the telephone, and was limited to 3 hours of internet/computer use every day. 
Anyways, last May we moved out into a house of my mom's friend where we stayed for a couple monthes. My mom fought for the house so we could have a real home again, and late July my dad had left the house for an appartment so we could live there.
Now, just 2 weeks ago, after much fighting and arguing, I have had to leave that house (from a 3 bedroom 2 bathroom) to a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment with me, my mom, and my sister.
My mom makes barely $16,000 a year working for Target and can't afford all the bills from the apartment, to the utlities, to her car payment and insurance, and so on.
My dad, meanwhile, makes $60,000 and complains about how he has no money (while all he has to pay for is his own god damn self.)
Last Christmas, he told me how he was really sorry he had no money to buy me a christmas present... Then the next sentence was how he got a deal on a GPS for $100.
My 18th birthday? He forgot it. Even after my mom reminded him, he didn't give a shit. 
My Highschool graduation? He didn't even congratulate me. 
He has literally disowned me, and I never got to know the true definition of  a ""dad"". 
I would have gotten a job already but having known I would be moving in a few weeks, I wasn't able to get a job for the last month. I'll be applying to many places shortly, but of course that means I still won't have money for a long time even IF I do get a job...

1352167190.0,0,self.randomactsofkindness,12pcrl,[Request] Buy me Natural Selection 2 on Steam. steamid: Jammku,Jammku,11,14,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/randomactsofkindness/comments/12pcrl/request_buy_me_natural_selection_2_on_steam/,"Â­It seems since late last year and the entirety of this year every game I have bought has ended up being bad. I'm kind of a weird guy; OCD, other personality disorders, schizo, etc. So I have convinced myself that any game I buy for the remainder of the year will be bad.

This is where you come in.

You can break my curse, AND get loads of entertainment out of the deal by gifting me Natural Selection 2 on Steam.

www.steamcommunity.com/id/jammku

For doing me this favor, I will reward you with youtube video created by me on whatever subject you might want, for any game I currently own, or any free game. I normally charge $40 an hour for coaching / training, being a former professional gamer, so this is a major deal.

I'd stream / act as a ""Day9"" / shoutcast / tutorial vid maker for this game if someone would gift me the game. I have over 5k invested in equipment, but refuse to buy the game because every single game I've bought this year has sucked majorly. Because I'm a fucking weirdo, I strongly believe that if I pay my own money for this game, it will suck, but if someone gifts me the game, it'll be Game of the Year.

I have plenty of cash, but every game I've bought this year has been complete trash. After reading the wiki, a lot of stuff from NS1 is gone so I'm a little worried about paying for this game.

If anyone gifts me the game, I'll make youtube videos 40 hours a week on the game. To the person that gifts me the game, I'd be willing to make videos on topics of their choice for a while as a gift.

I'm an ex-professional gamer with a full tool kit to provide HD videos.
