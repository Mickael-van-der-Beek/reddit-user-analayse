Very early on it was Howard himself. He wasn't famous and nobody cared, so he could say whatever he wanted.

As Howard got more famous, Jackie initiated that role, writing jokes that Howard could say but then blame on Jackie, getting hard hits in while keeping his rapport with guests.

That role came into its own with Billie West -- absolute chaos, saying the most terrible things that Howard could encourage while distancing himself, getting in the insults and hard topics that Howard could then soften and seriously talk about.

Artie then filled that role terrifically as well.

I get that Jackie cut off his own head, and they couldn't afford Billie, and Artie has deeper problems, *but that chair needs to be filled.*

What we have now is the soft Howard without anyone pushing him off the cliff.  He thinks that replacing one epic provocateur with a whole cast of mediocre characters is going to be the same, but it absolutely isn't.  

Sal and Richard?  Benji?  Ronnie? Who has the balls to say offensive things to guests?  If Leno came in tomorrow who would be what the Jackie Puppet was to Conan, saying what Howard and the fans are thinking, so Howard can riff off it?

You can painfully see a bland WWE format getting played out now.  So-and-so is a character, and while that character is close enough to their real personality that they play it well, they are still executing a series of predetermined scenarios.

Ronnie's crazy, Benji's weird, Sal &amp; Richard are boundry-less nitwits, Eric the Midget is the heel.  Howard is now just a ringmaster.  A Vince McMahon.

The problem is that Howard is both terrible and completely wasted as a ringmaster.  Someone who just sits there and says ""Do you have anything to say about what Ronnie just said to you?""  

It's tepid. Even Howard's bored.

Howard needs a genuine bomb thrower in the studio. Someone that Howard has to actively restrain and can let off the leash to do the dirty work when it's necessary.  Without that entropy it's just a talk show with occasional carny tricks and yelling.

Howard, I know you have been burned by the Jackies and Billies and Arties.  But they have to be greedy, unstable, self-loathing people to be what you need. 

You've surrounded yourself with a large number of discount B-players.  If you go find one more great one, someone that truly worries you, then the show will be great again overnight.

By the time he is back on the air next week, all that news will be considered old news... so I doubt he'll spend longer than five minutes on it.

Then I laughed endlessly when Howard teased him for it *again* the very next day, only this time with Fred adding random sound effects like gunfire and ducks quacking.  So good.  
  
* Great guest moments. I was annoyed that Maria was coming in but when Howard brought her trolling superfan boyfriend in on the interview, it got really amusing. Stuttering John still can't get over his hatred of Ralph. Adam Carolla complaining about Duran Duran, refrigerators at work, Rodney Dangerfield and telling the Natalie Maines story was fantastic...I still haven't listened to the Fallon interview.
  
* Fantastic prank call from Richard and Sal, really clever. I love how they used the poor guy who calls into Tradio regularly to prank the show, and then did it again with his own call defending himself.  Fucking hilarious.  
  
* Speaking of Richard and Sal, Howard goofing on them and pulling them into the studio is something that I've been missing lately- so having Richard come in and comment on their recent prank as well as making fun of Sal's yeast was gross but really funny to me.

So here's the story .. I have been a listener, and a fan for about 10 years. A little less then a year ago, on the air he had mentioned how he was looking up Adrianna Curry's Twitter, but wanted to see only her pictures. I thought, I could build that pretty quick. ..so I did, but it wasn't quick. Four months later it was pulling images, but not all of the users images, from the beginning of their timeline. Without going into too much detail, I was faced with a task of figuring out how to do this. Eleven months later, I have figured it out, and now it's ready to show it to you guys today.  We would love to hear some feedback. There is a ridiculous amount of programming, and time that went into figuring out the best way to make this possible.  So here it is ..""Howard Asked, and Adverse Listened"" ... All of Adrianne Currys Twitter Pictures.

- [2006-2010](http://www.sendspace.com/file/n156jn) And here we are. The uncensored years.

I will be adding an additional 'Gilbert' pack to tomorrows vacation day posting, with Gilbert appearances dating back to the 80s! Should be fun!

I hope Mr. Stern is having fun on AGT this week, because it's doing nothing for his career. Swinging for the fences, playing for an audience that just doesn't care, he's abandoned his hard core and we're going through withdrawal.

This is not about Howard Stern. You don't have to subscribe to Sirius or listen to his radio program to understand the point I'm making. That to truly triumph you've got to be so good that we miss you when you're gone. Which is rare in today's overmarketed society. You keep telling us to pay attention when what we really want to do is run away. Then there are performers who we just can't get enough of, who we consider family members, who have three-dimensional personalities and are so real we believe if we ran into them on the street we'd connect like best buddies.

Last weekend I read ""The New York Times"" and was stunned how mediocre most of the writing was. And the ""Times"" eclipses every newspaper but the ""Wall Street Journal."" Then I came across an article by Philip Roth and it intrigued me and cut like butter, and I'm not even a big fan of the New Jerseyite, not since the early novels like ""Goodbye Columbus"" and ""Portnoy's Complaint,"" but it's undeniable that Roth can write.

So I'm pushing the buttons on the Sirius dial and I get a bunch of people laughing on the Cosmo channel. This is entertaining why? This is how television news has been ruined over the past four decades, you're so busy looking chummy that you've forgotten the reason you're there, which is to inform us. TV news has lost the plot.

And just because they call it the morning zoo, that doesn't mean we want to listen to the animals. Outrageous is not a sustainable act. Stunts wear thin. You're telling a story on the radio, it's theatre of the mind, there has to be continuity and plot, no one can watch, never mind listen to, fireworks all day long.

You start listening to Stern and you wonder who all the extraneous people are. Ronnie Mund? Scott DePace? And then their personalities are revealed, and you realize you know people just like them in real life. Benji said he didn't know the definition of the word ""annoying,"" even though he was accurately described as the poster boy for that archetype. The raw frustration of intersecting with so many people is beautifully evidenced on the Stern show.

And instead of being constantly self-deprecating, or only telling us how great he is, like a rapper, Howard veers from side to side, edge to edge. He says how he goes to parties and he gets uptight because he's got nothing to say, the people scare him. Wow, I feel exactly the same way!

And then there are the interviews. Amy Schumer revealed she made 900k last year and I was astounded. My best friends won't tell me how much they make. And when I tweeted about it, Amy tracked me down and asked if she'd committed a faux pas. Huh? Suddenly I'm part of a private club, which is bigger than the mainstream clubs we're constantly being dunned about.

That's the modern paradigm. Nobody is the king of all media, nobody is everywhere. You've just got your niche, how big is it?

And if you're playing to people outside it, you're missing the point. They don't care. Expanding the brand? So Howard goes on ""America's Got Talent"" and judges acts not even edgy enough to appear on the ""Gong Show""? How can he be so wise and so stupid at the same time? Howard went to Sirius too early, but now the time is right, only those who care pay attention. And more people listen to Howard than watch the late night talk show hosts the mainstream press keeps bloviating about.

Now I'm not saying Stern should do what I want him to, be on the radio five mornings a week. But I am saying he's wasting his time playing to those who aren't core fans.

As for Howard's core fans... Listen to the Superfan Roundtable, where the commentators reference things that happened years ago. There's even a Celebrity Superfan Roundtable, hosted by Jeff Probst, featuring diehard fans like Natalie Maines. And you're probably clueless as to all this, but that's how strong a bond people have to Howard Stern.

And unlike everything but hoity-toity NPR, Howard sells product. Go on his show and watch your album fly up the iTunes chart.

And it's all because he's so damn good.

You think it's just talking into a microphone. You think anybody can play the guitar, anybody can have a hit record, but it takes years to hone your act, and dedication... Howard does lament that AGT interferes with his schedule, he doesn't have enough time to prepare!

And you can hear his preparation. And he extracts information from his guests no one else does. Since it's radio the interviews go on forever. They're not beholden to the Letterman formula, which is it's all comedy, it's all leading to punch lines.

Life is not a punch line.

Life is a series of highs and lows, speeding freeways and dead ends. And when you're on the 405, forced to listen to the drivel on the hundred other radio stations, you yearn for Howard Stern like your best bud from college, you just want to have conversation that's in the pocket, that makes you feel alive and connected.

I'm stunned how much time I dedicate to Howard.

But after this execrable week, being forced to listen to lame music and a rehash of the news, I'm ready for more.

Howard Stern built Sirius. Without him, it's toast.

That's the power of the individual, that's the power of entertainment, that's the power of art.

If you're not so damn good that people clamor for you when you go away, you're a second-rate player who can be forgotten instantly.

Howard, COME BACK!

P.S. Radio, the most ancient of mass media, is positively modern in the hands of Howard Stern. He knows it's not about what you did in the past, but what you keep doing. Dedicated fans don't want reruns, they want new stuff. There's never enough new stuff for a hard core fan, isn't that my point? By constantly creating new material, playing to the core, not worrying about the penumbra, Stern is doing what modern musicians should be doing but refuse to. You're not selling hits, but a career. It's the opposite of the nineties. Anybody can have a hit record, but can you sustain?

He basically said, they listen to our conversations and if they hear something fishy, they investigate further.  And that he's OK with that. 

We don't fully know the extent of what and who is being ""listened to"", but the idea is very, very creepy.  And very unsettling.

For Howard to breeze through this major news story, and to blow it off in such a way... Well, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Howard Stern's lost his balls.

You can go on and on about the show maturing, and Howard wanting to go ""mainstream"".  And I understand that.  Sure, I think the show is, sadly, in a bit of a rut - but nothing's perfect. 

But this?  This is incredibly sad.

I used to think of Howard as a common-sense, fair, no-nonsense guy.  I used to see him as a fighter, in his own way, for freedom and independence.  A champion for the downtrodden and a thorn in the side of authoritarianism.

Now, he's just a shill.",,False,self,t5_2qnxc,False,,,True,t3_1g3261,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1g3261/was_anybody_else_bothered_by_howards_view_on_the/,

It's always been bullshit to keep the audience on edge or get him a better deal when its eventually signed. 

HOWEVER, this time he does have a giant, real grievance with his employer and more than enough F.U. money to blow them off, so it's the first time I hear him grumble and think he might actually leave his current broadcasting arrangement.  ...but even if he does, that doesn't mean the show is over.   

If you remember them doing the story about how much that fucktard Glen Beck makes charging his legion of 300,000 followers $5 per month to listen to his self-distributed idiocy ($18,000,000+/year), imagine what Howard can do with his 7MM+ fanbase who are currently paying more than twice that per month for him, on average.  If 7million people pay Howard $10/per month directly for his show, that's $840,000,000 per year.  If he charges only five, it's $420mil....if only half follow him for $5, still $210mil EVERY YEAR!

OK, so I used to do this months ago and have decided with the immense amount of vacations, short weeks, etc. to start putting up old shows again. Now, a word of note about this particular show... it was a live show and therefore the audio is, well... it just ain't great. Listenable, sure... but it'd be hard to enjoy the musical performances. But stuff like this will likely never be reaired on H100. (Some of the local Dallas commercials are left intact and there are one or two small ""jumps"" when the cassettes recording were switched. Aside from that this is the full show.)

1368544407.0,26,self.howardstern,1ebg61,"The TL;DR of Bob Levy's ""true story""",RyanKinder,37,11,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1ebg61/the_tldr_of_bob_levys_true_story/,"From [this thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1ea6hl/the_true_story_of_what_happened_to_bob_levy_when/) - a few people said it was too long, I've drastically shortened it down to the pertinent points:
 
- Bob did a lot of stuff for free for them. Recording bumpers, promos, etc.
- Tim Sabean told Bob that he felt Bob should be paid for all his contributions. Bob said two plugs a week for his shows would be payment enough. (Bob makes it a point to say the little money they could scrounge up wouldn't be enough, plugs would be better.)
- Howard and Gary agree to plugs.
- Miserable Men begins on H101. Bob states he and all comedians worked for free.
- Finally, after complaining, Bob states he got $200 per show. (Pay stayed the same when the show went from 1 to 2 hours.)
- First Killers of Comedy show happens, but nobody shows up. Bob wants to get on Howard's show to plug it. Gary says no. Bob starts a forced fight with Gary on Ferrall's show to get on air on Stern. It works. Leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth.
- Bob and his wife said no to having their wedding taped by HTV. He then says this was adding to his having a bad rep in the ""Stern plantation"" (comparing the Stern show to slavery.)
- Tim had told Bob Howard was going to pull all his plugs but that he would give him one plug back if he didn't go on O&amp;A.
- Bob had to fight Tim to allow Jimmy Norton (from O&amp;A) to be on Miserable Men.
- Mis. Men expands to four hours, Bob still only gets paid $200.
- Howard goes off on all the plugs because of four Levy plugs in a row. Levy states Howard was actually mad about a long Chuck Zito plug, but would never want to confront Zito for fear of physical harm.
- Bob calls in and Howard said he had no problems with Bob. Everything goes back to normal, Bob figures Howard needed material for the air, however Bob is fed up.
- Bob calls Tim, tells him he's going to end his relationship with Stern and do stuff with O&amp;A. Tim tries to persuade him otherwise. Bob rejects him.
- Bob finds he is banned from the building. When he calls up Tim's assistant, he (Jarrod) says it is because Bob assaulted four security guards.
- He calls the next day, Jarrod denies saying he said Bob assualted security. But he's still banned.
- He calls yet again the next day. Jarrod goes back to the assault story.
- This next part shouldn't be TL;DR'd: ""Seeing how this cycle was going Bob decided to go back to his good old standby bit, ATTACK YOUR TARGET if you can't get an answer. That should get someone's attention at the Stern Show! So Bob goes on his Stickam PodCast at LevyLand and **announces how he plans to murder Howard Stern and his wife.**""
- He says Stern called the police and FBI about the threat. They showed up ""after checking out the situation they informed Bob that he's much too talented to be playing these games. He needs to just move along with his career, to which he agreed.""
- Bob starts doing a bit for O&amp;A, but then finds he is banned from all Sirius XM shows/building.

--------

That ends the TL;DR, here's Bob in his own words responding to people on that forum (you can skip this part if you want):

- Commenter says he fucked himself over with the death threats. Bob says: ""sorry im not a pussy he fucked with me i went after him and i heard he was shitting in his pants from people there ""
- Commenter asked what was up with him and Artie fighting on the show. Bob says: ""me and artie always fucked with each other the rant on the crap up show he told me stay outside for 10 minutes i got a great idea..as we drove home together he told me about it ..i said thats brilliant and we listen to it in my car laughing the whole ride home""
- Why did he take the bullshit for so long? Bob says: ""because of the promise its coming soon its coming soon""
- Bob goes on to say to someone else: ""i could have got on any show i got on the stern show ..me ..do you get it i could have gone to anyone at that time and i make a living as a comedian and was doing great before i went on his show""
- Bob responds to someone who didn't believe his tale about the cops and what they said to him: ""they sat me down they said bob you cant do this we listen to the show your a talented guy you dont need this just move on and i said i was ..they said he's very scared""
- Commenter asks when he'll be on Artie's show again, Bob rants: ""soon and about wishing cancer on them ..let me clear that up shuli's dope growing baby sitter operator said something on my facebook i didnt like so i said i hope your family gets cancer it was directed to him.....also about the other guys on mm they were all pussys i had to do all there dirty work with tim because they would cry to me all the time...and the fact they wouldnt work with me if i came back IT WAS MY FUCKING SHOW THAT THEY TRIED TO MAKE IT INTO A FAG SHOW""
- Commenter asks if he knows what's up with Robin: ""no man last response i got from someone who didnt stick up for me and tell the truth to howard said ..i cant lose my job i said ok faggot ..there all scared and weak""",,False,self,t5_2qnxc,1368553023.0,,,True,t3_1ebg61,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1ebg61/the_tldr_of_bob_levys_true_story/,

1355844183.0,27,self.howardstern,151ynm,How much each main on air figure of the Stern Show is worth...,RyanKinder,30,3,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/151ynm/how_much_each_main_on_air_figure_of_the_stern/,"A thread came up with Jackie talking about how much he made when he left the Stern show in 2001. The figure was $1.25 million, but this included his standup gigs. Someone then wondered what Fred makes now. I started writing a response but felt it deserved its own thread:

To give you an idea at guessing: Fred was considered the head writer of the show before Jackie was given the title of co-head writer. BUT, add to that the fact that Fred was (and still is) also the head board op with sound effects. He also does side gigs with his band King Norris. If I were to guess: When Jackie was worth 1.25 mil in 2001, Fred was worth about the same but *without* needing to do stand up gigs. (Remember, that figure for Jackie was with stand up gigs.)

Now, you asked what does he make now. Inflation (it's been over ten years since Jackie's left - plus the much more lucrative satellite deal) - one can ballpark Fred at about 3 million and Robin at about 7 million (since she is, in all essence, considered a co-host as she takes over control of an hour of the show.)

Now, this is all guesswork... the site howard loves, Celebrity Net Worth, has a breakdown for most of the on air talent. Since he uses it as a source (especially when guests come in) it might mean that he believes it because of other stuff he's seen for people he knows. Here it is:

- Fred Norris: $6 million a year (with a net worth of $16 million.) [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/fred-norris-net-worth/)
- Robin Quivers: $10 million a year (with a net worth of $45 million. [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/...celebrities/robin-quivers-net-worth/)
- Benjy Bronk: $3 million net worth (site doesn't say how much a year, but with a net worth estimate like that it'd probably be somewhere around $750k-$900k - plus he does stand up / sells music / does that 'bang bang show') [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/benjy-bronk-net-worth/)
- Gary Dell'Abate: $4 million/yr (with a net worth of $15 million.) [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/gary-dellabate-net-worth/)
- Howard Stern: $80 million/yr (with a net worth of $500 million.) [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/howard-stern-net-worth/)
- JD: $50,000/yr (net worth of $100,000) [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/jd-harmeyer-net-worth/)
- Ronnie Mund: $500,000 (site only has his total net worth figure.) [Source.](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/race-car-drivers/ronnie-mund-net-worth/)
- Sal Governale / Richard Christy: The site only lists Sal and says he's worth a total of $400,000. One would expect Richard to be close to that.

Now, are all these figures accurate? Who knows - it doesn't seem like they factored in things like Gary's book deal, Robin's TV holding deals, Ronnie's TV deals and his Block Party money, Richard's residuals from Iced Earth and Charred Walls of the Damned sales, Sal and Richard's stand up money... and glaringly missing is a mention of Howard's AGT deal - so suffice to say the site is a bit out of date on his figure at least.",,False,self,t5_2qnxc,False,,,True,t3_151ynm,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/151ynm/how_much_each_main_on_air_figure_of_the_stern/,

This is not a list of every one-liner Howard made, it's a list of things that may have come from Benjy. Things to consider:

* Some time between the topic being brought up, Benjy being able to write/type it and Howard read it. (callbacks)
* Joke is short and requires little or no setup 
* Howard going from speaking conversationally to speaking in ""joke delivery mode"" (although I don't think Howard always reads jokes given to him verbatim) 

(times taken from the WDM recording)
________________________________

**13:17** ""I think I would play this and I would *rush* to the bathroom, that's why they named it ""rush"". (Howard talking about playing Rush records on the radio)

**32:51** ""The weird thing is I understood this guy better than I do JD."" (Guy from Rush making the ""blah blah blah"" speech)

**42:31** ""She's working on a song, I read in a magazine, it's called 'Tuna Fish sandwich'."" (Ridiculous topics of Taylor Swift songs.)

**3:31:00** ""Angelina Jolie made the Ann Curry demand a year ago."" (Not a joke, but a note that was written by Benjy because Howard immediately asks him to elaborate)


**3:37:30** ""There is a WJZZ in Detroit"" (Probably another note Benjy or the back office googled)

**3:55:23** ""You get between 53k and 65k for being a deaf interpreter in LA"" (Benjy or back office googling note)
___________________________

Monday's show didn't have a single ""obvious"" Benjy joke. Either he didn't write much, or listening for his jokes is harder than I thought.

Since I didn't get much I'll try again with Tuesday's show tomorrow.

Howard impersonating his mom giving his dad a BJ was one of the funnier moments of the previous week.  It was uncomfortable and hilarious at the same time.  

I usually think when he does impersonate his parents, it is funny sometimes, but when I started listening to this (on public transportation) I couldn't stop laughing and people were looking at me funny.

Anyone else enjoy that bit?  I feel like it was probably the funniest bit of the week and it was spontaneous which made it better.

I wouldn't be surprised if he's mentioned at some
Of the big meetings he's had with the staff that he wanted to focus less on AGT this year. 

I'm sure in a way it kind of hurts his ego that his main fans hate the show, plus the piece of shit acts that made it to the finals last year have taken a toll on his need to discuss AGT, but at the end of the day he's getting paid tons of money to just show up and be a part of a show he genuinely enjoys doing.

If you factor in increased availability due to shorter work weeks/more weeks off, I think a motivated comic could make up to 5 mil a year from stand up just from being on THSS.

Howard reminisced about the good old days when Richard and Sal's craziness were a semi-daily occurrence.

However, as anyone who's listened to the show over the last 7 years knows, **Howard and Robin spent 99% of Richard and Sal's in-studio time telling them to get the fuck out because they were acting gay, stupid or unfunny.** Gary would often pipe up to say that he never approved them walking in on the show.

At one point, Howard even threatened their jobs if they continued to bypass Gary's gatekeeping. Is it any wonder why they sealed themselves in their office?

So, to summarize... Howard wants them to keep intruding on the studio... *so he can demand that they stay out of the studio*

A long time ago I was in psychology class and I remember something called the rule of three(It was a long time ago so I don't know if that's actually what it's called) Basically the rule says that if there is any group of three people then naturally one person will get left out. Two will always gang up on the other. 

Howard being the instigator that he is, will just fuel the fire when ever any one goes after to each other, so he is the natural person. If anyone one is around anyone for a long period of time they will eventually get on your nerves. What to do to combat this? Add a 4th person who NOOOBBOODDDYY likes. Think about Howard and Benji's interactions. There is never a point when Howard is talking with Benji that he doesn't say something about how ""he annoys him"". 

**TL;DR**
The only Reason Benji is in the studio is to be hated ",,False,self,t5_2qnxc,1362146894.0,,,True,t3_19gmqw,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/19gmqw/benji_theory/,

This was in the notepad file. 

*""The Howard Stern Show - Musical Memories""
WIZN 106.7 FM ('The Wizard')
Burlington, Vermont, USA
Air Date: Friday, December 16, 2005 (3PM to 7PM)
Announcer: Mike Luoma


Howard Stern's long-running syndicated morning FM radio show aired for the last time on Friday, December 16, 2005.  In January 2006, Howard and crew took up residence at Sirius Satellite Radio. Howard's old FM show featured many great musical guests and performances over the years. An FM station that aired the Stern show, WIZN (""The Wizard"") in Burlington, Vermont, played 45 previously taped Stern Show musical performances over four hours during the afternoon following the final 2005 broadcast. I recorded the WIZN ""Musical Memories"" tribute broadcast using a Sansui TU-9900 FM tuner directly to hard disc and then edited out the commercials and as much of the between-song DJ banter as possible. What is left are nearly three hours of classic performances in stellar FM sound quality, thanks in large part to the legendary Sansui super tuner. The relaxed vibe of the Stern Show always seemed to bring out the best in musicians who were not used to waking up and performing so early in the morning!

Some of these tracks have circulated previously as substandard MP3 files sourced from a low-bit-rate Sirius Satellite Radio broadcast, but this FLAC file set, which has not circulated previously, is the genuine lossless FM high-fidelity article. Listen to James Taylor's guitar on ""Woodstock"" or Alanis Morissette's voice on ""Ironic"" for examples of the Sansui's incredible combination of analog musical warmth and detail, which somehow managed to survive largely intact despite the necessary evil of the FM &gt; WAV &gt; FLAC digitization process.

These tunes were either performed in Howard Stern's New York City FM studio or in front of live audiences at remote Stern Show broadcasts. The in-studio tunes include several great acoustic versions of electric favorites (e.g., ""Pour Some Sugar On Me"" by Def Leppard). There are also some outstanding cover tunes, including Kid Rock doing the Charlie Daniels classic, ""Long Haired Country Boy"" and Train performing a rocking Led Zeppelin medley. One Stern Show inside joke is Blues Traveler's version of ""This Is Beetle."" 'Beetle' is Stern Show ""Wack Pack"" member Lester ""Beetlejuice"" Green, who wrote the song spontaneously one day on the Show. NOTE: The WIZN broadcast also included Staind's version of ""This Is Beetle."" The Staind version, which was the seventh song of the broadcast, is omitted because it was released officially on a limited edition version of Staind's ""Chapter V"" album.

There are so many highlights in this set that it would be tough to pick a favorite. Aerosmith's raucous ""Bacon Biscuit Blues"" is hard to top, though, I must admit!

I do not know the dates these songs were performed / first aired. If anyone can shed some light on the performance dates, that would be great.

Finally, one small request: Please do not circulate this file set in MP3 or other lossy formats.

But hey -- enough of my yakkin'. Whaddaya say? Let's boogie!

Its like giving a a set of new tires to someone retiring from Ford Motors. The way Howard was talking before he opened the gift I figured it was going to be something over the top.

1369394164.0,22,self.howardstern,1eyqls,"Eric the Midget fanfiction - ""Unspoken Desires""",rajjiv,33,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1eyqls/eric_the_midget_fanfiction_unspoken_desires/,"The man known as Eric the Actor yawned as he lazily played with the bubbles in his bath. He loved bathing. The feeling of warm water around him comforted him – as if he were in his own soup. 

“Jon!” Eric called. “I’m ready to get out.” *This is the only damn time Jon helps me in the bathroom*, he thought bitterly. *Not what those jackasses on the show say about him wiping my ass.*

Jon walked into the bathroom. Fresh after a workout, his pasty skin glistened horribly with sweat. The spandex he wore squeaked with each step he took. He stood by the bath, the bulge in his crotch uncomfortably close to Eric’s face.

“You look like you lost some weight, Eric.” Jon smiled coyly, as his eyes explored Eric’s naked, submerged body.

Eric sighed. “Just get me out, Jon.”

“That’s what I’m here for, buddy.” Jon ejaculated.

Jon’s trained hands were used to carrying Eric. He put his arms under Eric, like one would carry a damsel in distress.  As he was about to lift Eric, his arm under Eric’s legs slipped upward and brushed against Eric’s penis.

The silence was unbearable. Jon’s eyes locked with Eric’s. 

“Eric, please…” Jon began. 

“Jon, stop it. You know I’m not like that.” Eric quietly interrupted him. “Just lift me out and leave.”

Jon choked back tears. “But Eric, I know deep down inside, you-“

“Listen, you fucking jackass.” Eric suddenly erupted. “I’m not a fucking fag, ok?” He turned his head around to hide his tears. “Just… just get me the fuck out. NOW.”

Not a word was spoken as Jon placed Eric on his bed. Eric, secure in his PJ pants, did not even look at Jon. He turned on his computer.

Jon, standing at the doorway, said “I knew you before you were Eric the Midget. Before you were Eric the Actor. Before… the show.”

Eric still refused to face Jon. He silently logged into Twitter.

Jon continued, his voice trembling. “You can lie to all of them, Eric. Howard, Artie, The Bunny Ranch… you can lie to all of them but you can’t lie to yourself.”

Eric remained silent. Finally he spoke. “Jon, get my dinner ready.” His voice was emotionless.

Jon cleared his throat and wiped his eyes. “Ok, Eric.” he whispered. “I’ll do that.” He left the room.

Eric slammed his hands against the keyboard. He wanted to scream. Flashes of Diana Degarmo, Airforce Amy and all the other whores he met went through his mind. 

*I fucked them all*, he convinced himself. *I made sure everyone knew I was obsessed with them. I got Howard to send me to the Bunny Ranch. I got Johnny to introduce me to Kendra. I buried my face in tits… live on air. I HARASSED THOSE GIRLS TO DEATH.*

Eric then took a long breath and threw his hands in the air. *Then why is the only name I hate besides Eric the Midget is… Eric the Liar?*

With a dexterity unknown to the show, Eric flung himself around face down into his mattress. Sobbing and wailing, he begin humping his mattress feverishly.

*At best* they'd probably slash the fuck out of his budget and make his life hell, but I'd doubt they'd bother with a scenario that complicated. New ownership usually wants a clean slate and isn't likely to keep around the step kids from Sirius' former parents.

I'm guessing Howard went to his staff and informed them that a buyout could be in the works, which is why all these side projects are popping up. Gary's taking a podcast outside of Sirius, Jon went to Destination America, Sal's signing on to do B movies, the crew is hoarding gig money...

If you have gotten thru, how do they screen you?  I imagine they ask you what you want to talk about, but they warn you not to deviate off-topic or anything?  Seems Howard hates the small talk &amp; just wants you to get to the point.  

Also, how long did you have to wait before being screened and getting on air?  Seems like even regulars--Eric the Midget, I'm looking at you--have to wait forever...and sometimes don't even make it on-air.

Here's Benjy's ""Hurricane Irene"" special from this weekend (credit **WDM**):
http://www.sendspace.com/file/s3j078

--------------------------------------

...and here's MORE Gilbert appearances that weren't included in the last pack. These are all from Gilbert's appearances in 1991 (credit - **BIGAUDIO**):

Bigaudio's notes on the appearances:

- 1991 January 10 (**DOWNLOAD**: http://www.sendspace.com/file/826c4x )

Gilbert and Suzanne Vega appear together on Howard's Birthday show.
Gilbert is his annoyingly cutting best, repeatedly making remarks relating to Suzanne and just being Gilbert, really.

(*Bigaudio notes: Sound on this is not the best, hiss being the main culprit.*)

The original tape is of low quality unfortunately.
Running time is 20 minutes.


- 1991 January 15  (**DOWNLOAD**: http://www.sendspace.com/file/i8730y )

The night before the birthday show, as Gary explains, Gilbert
left him a message **in his real voice**.  Very short clip.

Running time 1 minute 46 seconds.

- 1991 February 22 (**DOWNLOAD**: http://www.sendspace.com/file/ezva1k)

Gilbert sits in for a spot while they tape the show at the Grammys.

Running time is 12 minutes.

- 1991 May 22 (**DOWNLOAD**: http://www.sendspace.com/file/s9hpi4 )

Gilbert gets lectured by Howard about his bashing of Howard.  Howard explains the reason for Gilbert's unhappiness with Howard. A woman Gilbert had ""relations"" with calls in.  Also, a promotions rep from the Washington station appears with a listener who won a contest in DC.

(*Bigaudio notes: Unfortunately my tape runs out before the very end of the appearance.*)

Running time is 1 hour 36 minutes.

- 1991 June 3 (**DOWNLOAD**: http://www.sendspace.com/file/oqohq4 )

Gilbert made 3 appearances on the show in June of 91, this being the first. They do the news, and Gilbert sometimes breaks into ""Frankenstein"".

Running time 1 hour 28 minutes.

- 1991 July 29 (**DOWNLOAD**: http://www.sendspace.com/file/5h6fui )

Gilbert sits in for the news, one of the stories is about Pee Wee Herman and his arrest in a porno theater.
Also, longtime Howard friend and fellow ""DJ"" Meg Griffin appears and Howard plays a tape of Meg's show the night Elvis Presey's death was announced. (Bigaudio notes his tape runs out before the very end unfortunately.)

Running time is 1 hour 26 minutes.

But hearing these stories, even the ones I'd heard before, just didn't feel funny. I felt sad for my friend and made me wish there was something I could do to help him. And knowing that no matter where the book ended, the story was inevitably leading to that terrible night in his kitchen gave a somber pallor to even Rev. Bob's stumbling through the text.  

I've never met Artie, and I probably never will. But he made the show so much better when he was there.  He pulled the show out of the bitter meanness that pervaded after Jackie's departure and he reminded us that sometimes the simplest things were (rightly) hilarious and that it was OK to laugh, even during at the bad times, because hey man, if it's funny, it's funny.  

I need to listen to the recordings of his recent radio appearances.  I'm not a sports nut, so I'll probably miss most of the discussion, but I'd like to hear him happy again and looking to enjoy the fruits that luck, good timing and hard work have brought him.  

So as I sit in my cubicle on my lunch break, I raise my Pepsi to you, Artie. Fiyaa and I hope I can tune in and rekindle our friendship again soon.",,False,self,t5_2qnxc,False,,,True,t3_jt74p,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/jt74p/just_finished_too_fat_to_fish_audiobook/,

1366226662.0,17,self.howardstern,1cjwk0,"Weekly New Show Discussion - An idea to address the constant complaints of ""too much negativity"".",flignir,23,6,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1cjwk0/weekly_new_show_discussion_an_idea_to_address_the/,"*I think the reason this subreddit seems ""all negative"" to some is that anger and negativity are often more interesting subjects for discussion than bland admiration.  (What call would you expect to be more entertaining: Debbie the Pet Lady calling to scream at Howard about how she isn't respected, or Bobo calling to say how much he loves AGT?)  Because of this factor, I think most people don't bother trying to start a discussion with the idea that they liked something, but everyone jumps right in and posts when they hate something.  So maybe it will help if we have a regular thread that creates a place for positive discussion, even without outlawing whining.* 

*Most subreddits dedicated to a show have a particular discussion every week where general reactions to the week's new show are focused.  This is a good place for people to say that one thing or another was great, and maybe a conversation will start from a place other than whining.  (But feel free to whine, too...censorship would make the whole thing suck.)*

**TL;DR-Maybe you people won't bitch so much if we have an episode discussion thread whenever there is a new show.  Here's one for this week.**

He has his hands tied when it comes to budget and hiring talent for the other programs (see Bubba and Ferall) and he probably isn't motivated to go above and beyond in any way because of the feud as well.

Anyways, as we all know Mel Karmazin is gone starting next year and I believe Scott Greenstein is on his way out too. You don't have to be a superfan to read between the lines and see that these two guys were the ones putting all the money into celebrity circle-jerks while cutting the budget to actual radio talent like Ferall and Bubba.

Well I heard some good news on a special Bubba show last night. He said that after over 2 years of no communication with Sirius they are back in talks about bringing Bubba back to the Howard channels or even giving him his own set of channels. He said Tim Sabien and Howard were both enthusiastic and that for the first time things actually look like they might be moving.

I know a lot of you guys don't like Bubba but I think this indicates a general move in the right direction for programming at Sirius. The management over the last few years has been horrible and a change is definitely a positive thing. They need to get back to hiring actual radio talent and not all the bullshit no-name people we hear on the channels these days.",,False,self,t5_2qnxc,False,,,True,t3_1566q2,http://www.reddit.com/r/howardstern/comments/1566q2/changes_for_the_better_may_be_coming_in_2013/,

Howie lost his edge, barely promoted the show on Letterman, Daily Show, etc . . ., and never took the show on the road to Vegas or the like.  By doing AGT, it shows that Howard is ready, willing and able to put down his bishop, rook, or pawn and put himself out there again.  

Moreover, as he stated yesterday, Howard is going to get criticized for his performance on AGT.  Critics from People Magazine, Us, or the PTC are going to blast Howard, which will set him off.  Howard will go nuts. This is going to lead to more rants, attacks, and fun from Howie on the radio.  

Finally, Howard is going to be tired and stressed from all of the traveling, tapings, promos, etc. . .  Grouchy Howard will be a fun listen.  I feel bad for Booey, Sal, Richard, Benjy, Scott and Ronnie.  I feel good for the audience.

Why?  Because he helped Ron Jeremey and Tabitha Stevens film a porn in Howards studio and even at his console (if i recalll correctly).

[wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Mroszak#Howard_Stern_Show) - On February 7, 2007 it was revealed that Mroszak allowed a porno film featuring Ron Jeremy and Tabitha Stevens to be shot in Howard's studio without permission. When confronted by Stern and crew, Mroszak contended that he produced the film but did not directly participate, rather playing ""a Steven Spielberg type role"" and that the film had been destroyed. On February 8, 2007 Howard questioned whether Mroszak could ever again be trusted, while Fred described the porn antics as ""a sign of disrespect."" In 2009 Ron Jeremy confirmed that Mroszak acted in the movie.
