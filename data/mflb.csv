**Q: How stealthy is the MFLB?**

A: It's definitely one of the most stealthy ways to medicate.  The box dimensions are 2.5 by 1.25 by 0.9 inches. It fits in the palm of your hand and in your pocket. If you live with people who are not OK with your habits, you can use the box in the next room over without them knowing.  People successfully use it in public places everyday as well, thanks to the rechargeable AA batteries.

**Q: Well, how much does it actually smell when using it?**

A: As with all vaporizors, there is a minimal, distinct smell during use. The more your herb smells, the more vaporizing it is going to smell.  With that said, the smell doesn't linger and will go away in ten minutes max in a ventilated room by normal usage.  To keep the smell to a minimum, I have found that blowing hits out through my clothes or into a pillow greatly reduces the smell, or you can use a sploof. If you do not use it in a ventilated room and do not keep your stash in an airtight container, the room will probably smell no matter what, so just use common sense.

**Q: How much herb will I conserve by using the MFLB?**

A: One normal 'trenchload' is about equivalent to ~0.1g.  Depending on tolerance, one trenchload is usually enough to get 1-3 people pretty medicated. Also, the same amount of herb will last you about 3x-5x as long vaporizing it than if you smoked it since you use a lot less vaporizing.  Getting any sort of vaporizer ends up paying for itself in the longrun with the money you save from conserving herb.

**Q: What's the difference between the high from smoking and vaping?**

A: This depends on the person; some people prefer one over the other. The general consensus, however, is that vaporizing is more relaxing and mellow than smoking, and you can do it for a lot longer period of time before becoming 'burnt out'. If you've never tried vaporizing before, use someone else's before you purchase one.

**Q: How many people can the MFLB accommodate?**

A: As many people as you want it to, although it does not work very well in big groups as you have to repack the vaporizer a lot, and you might run out of batteries.  If you plan on using this between yourself and a few friends, it's perfect.  If you plan on vaping mostly in large groups, consider a plug-in vaporizer like the Silver Surfer, Volcano, Extreme-Q, Vapor Bros, etc.

**Q: How durable is the MFLB, and what happens if it breaks?**

A: Its made out of solid wood with a plastic slide cover, so it's pretty durable.  Although, if you drop it on the plastic part, the cover could break off (happened to me). But don't worry! The MFLB comes with a lifetime warranty and the company has AWESOME customer service.  Even if it's you're fault, you email the company inquiring for a replacement and they will send you a brand new one after confirming your serial number. Just follow their instructions.

**Q: Ok, I'm convinced. Where can I order one of these things and how discrete is the packaging?**

A: The recommended place to order the MFLB is from the company's website, [http://magic-flight.com/](http://magic-flight.com/).  There are some other trusted online vendors, such as [http://www.puffitup.com/](http://www.puffitup.com/) and Amazon.  Check the details when you order for specifics. The packaging is discreet and doesn't give any indication to what it is.

**B) General Information**

**Q: OK, I have the box.  What's the best way to use it?**

A: First thing is first. Make sure all your batteries are charged fully before using. Once they're charged, you're going to want to grind the herb into the **FINEST CONSISTENCY POSSIBLE**. To accomplish this, turn your grinder upside down while grinding so the herb keeps grinding and doesn't fall through the holes. If you don't have a grinder, you can also use a pill bottle and a nickle and shake it. Next, you can pack the trench with the herb. You can pack as little as you want, but the maximum you should pack is up to the top of the trench without it overflowing.  Also, make sure it is **loosely packed!** Also, you can use the draw stem or just hit it from the hole, it's up to personal preference.

Now, press your battery into the side of the mflb, positive (nipple end) first. You're going to see the red light come on inside. Keep holding it in until you can see vapor start accumulating in the box (~5sec).  From here, the community decided 'best' way to hit it is by taking 'sips' of vapor.  [This guy gives a pretty good description on how to do it if you are having problems](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz68fCk97fM) Practice makes perfect. Make sure you shake it between hits. After the herb turns dark brown and stops giving good hits, empty the box out. **SAVE THE HERB!!!** You can use it for other things, as described in the next section.  Make sure you use the brush to get any remaining material out. Don't get lazy and do this everytime, your box will thank you.

**Q: I accidently burned it! What should I do?**

A: You or someone inexperienced may accidently burn it, and that's ok! You did not ruin it.  To ensure that the burnt smell and taste does not linger in the box, immediate empty out the box and clean it right away!

**Q: How do I clean it?**

A: Make sure the box is empty of material, and open up your box. Push in the battery to heat up anything on the screen.  After about 10 seconds, remove the battery and place your brush in iso. CAREFULLY brush the inside of the screen thoroughly.  You can use a tissue to CAREFULLY wipe out the inside of the box to dry it off.  The screen may be discolored in some spots, and will remain this way.  Its due to normal usage, and it will not affect your functionality whatsoever.  Repeat until satisfied, then heat the box up again to vaporize any remaining iso.

To clean the draw stems, the best method I have found is to take most of the cotton off the ends of q-tips, dip them is iso, then push them through the stems. You can also soak the stems in iso, but this is not recommended because if you leave them in for too long the material will degrade.  Either way, after you clean them with iso just rinse them with water and voila.

**Q: So what's the deal with the batteries? How long do they last? Can I use any other types?**

A: Each battery will last from 1-2 trenches, depending on the amount you pack in.  It comes with 2 rechargeable batteries, so a full charge for both batteries will last about 4 trenches, which is more than enough for a few people.  Mine take a few hours to recharge, and I use this quite frequently with friends so I purchased more batteries. You can use any AA Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries above 2000mAh.  Generally, the higher the mAh the better.  Some good ones are the energizers with the fifteen-minute recharger that you can find relatively anywhere that sells rechargeable batteries.  Another good brand are Powerex's, as well as Eneloops. You just have to make sure that you peel off the coating on the outside of the aftermarket batteries so that the negative body can touch the metal loop on the inside of the box. Like [this](http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/763/20101030.jpg).

**Q: How should I store the batteries?**

A: You should always put the protective caps on the positive ends of the stock batteries.  If any part of the negative and positive parts touch metal and complete a circuit, the batteries can melt. This is obviously bad and will ruin your batteries.
  
**Q: Can I vape kief or hash?**

A: Yes! Just sprinkle a VERY TINY pinch the trench and vape it like you normally would.  After it's done, immediately clean it out to minimize the risk of the kief/hash clogging the screen.  These hits result in an insta-high, so use as cautiously or recklessly as needed.

**C) AVB** 

**Q: What's a good firecracker recipe for AVB?**

A: If you don't want to eat it straight up or in gel caps, this firecracker  method has never failed me.  Since the amount of THC and other cannabinoids left over depends on the quality of herb and the extent it has been vaped and is ALREADY ACTIVATED, there's no set amount to use.  For a general rule, 0.5-1g per person is enough for all the time's I've made it. Take the amount of AVB that you want to use and put it in all natural peanut butter, nutella, or both for maximum deliciousness.  Mix in enough pb/nutella to completely cover and mix in the AVB.  Again, don't worry about measurements here. It just needs to be thoroughly mixed in depending on how much AVB you have. You can eat this on crackers straight away, or you can attempt to get the little remaining THC activated by microwaving (yes, microwaving) the mixture in 15-30sec intervals until the mixture changes consistency. You'll see what I mean when you do it.  Allow to cool, put on crackers, and enjoy.  These creep on slowly for most people, so wait at least and hour and a half before you decide to ingest more.  The microwave method is fast, and with no smell, so you can do it at home or in a dorm no problem.

**Q: What about green/brown dragon?**

A: This is simply AVB soaked in ethyl (drinkable) alcohol.  The easiest way to do this is to take high proof alcohol (151 or everclear) and put the AVB you've accumulated into a jar with just enough alcohol so that the level of alcohol above the AVB sediment is a about an inch. Put a lid on the jar and shake it up, and allow it to sit over night.  After 24 hours, use a coffee filter to strain out the AVB, and voila.  The standard dose is about a tablespoon. You should definitely mix it with juice or something.  If you want it stronger, just leave the alcohol uncovered so that some evaporates off.

AVB (Alredy Vaped Bud)

* Use a small airtight container to store your AVB. People commonly use small ziplock containers.
* Use a contact case to hold freshly ground herb, and AVB if you are taking your box out with you.
* Once you vape your bud the heat activates the THC in the weed but doesnt get 100% out.
* You can save the vaped cannabis to cook with, eat, or smoke.
* You can eat the AVB and get high from it just like any other edibles without the need to cook/bake the weed.
* Smoke the AVB. I like to roll joints with it.
* Generally you would want to use 1-2 grams of AVB in a sandwitch or other food to get an effect. The amount varies per user and tolerance.

ITS ACTUALLY CALLED A THIRD LUNG, thank you burrit0ninja.

**Why should I use the Third Lung with my MFLB, Elmder?**

You've seen the front page of r/mflb recently! Well, maybe you've become disenfranchised with the MFLB because it doesn't get you to that extreme level of highness you're looking to reach. Maybe you've shown your friends your MFLB, and they've tried it, and they say its nice but it doesn't seem to get them that high and you think they're just being nice saying it's nice, especially since the MFLB doesn't excel in a crowd. Maybe you like the physics of the lung and watching the precious vapor pour out of the stem and the bag snap back as you rocket all the vapor from the lung to your lungs. Hell, maybe you're like me, and you have an exceptionally high tolerance - YES. IT EVEN WORKS FOR THAT. THE THIRD LUNG IS JESUS - I'M NOT GOING TO BEAT AROUND THE BURNING BUSH.

I don't care where you've been, all that matters is you're here now. You want a third lung. I can help. 

**How do you make one, Elmderrrr?**

First, check the video at the top. There's instructional text below but my video will probably explain it better.

Before you make it, here's some third lung examples currently on the front page to help you understand the concept of what you'll be making. Go upvote them if you like them.

**And a video:**[salty84](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW6Ulx60Cqs&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)

FOR NOW, text will have to do. I've explained the making in another thread. Heres the quote text:

&gt;Cut a bottle in half. Throw away bottom half. Get a plastic bag, (the closer it is in volume/size as the top half, the better). Get duck tape as well.

&gt;Now, tape the edges of the bag to the edges of the top half of the bottle. Make sure you seal extremely well, so no air can get between the bag and the bottle.

&gt;Final Obstacle: Take the cap of your bottle and you need to poke, burn, w/e a stem sized hole in the cap. I used the needle of a graphing compass, then used a dental pick, then the point of some scissors and finally poked out a hole that perfectly fit my stem.

&gt;Now, time to enjoy it. Push the bag all the way inside the top. Load your MFLB, put the stem in, and place the MFLB w/ stem into the hole you cut in the cap. Grab the part of the bag closest to the cap with you fingers. Begin pressing in the battery, hold ~5 seconds, then begin pulling the bag with your fingers out of the bottle away from the cap. You should see vapor spew out of your stem into the bottle. IMPORTANT: The vapor should be grey and opaque. If it is WHITE, pull the bag faster. If you see no vapor spewing, pull slower.

&gt;Once you've filled the bottle to your heart's content, get at that vapor any of the following ways:
*Spin the cap off, drink like soda.
*Pull MFLB off, leave stem in cap, drink like soda through straw.
*Pull MFLB and stem off, sip through hole in cap.

&gt;Bam! I have increased the potency of your hits by x%! Two trenches gets me to a clear-headed, euphoric [8]! Enjoy!

Finally, some good old broken down decision making in the form of a pros and cons list:

**PROS**

* Can take you to an [8] and beyond
* Great for group vaping! We've essentially Macgyvered a Volcano Vaporizer on a budget!
* Easy to make, once one cap is stem-size hole punched, you can use that cap on different sized third lungs. Say 16 oz for personal, 1 liter for group, 2 liter for special occassions.

**Cons**

* May present a stronger smell then regular MFLB. Use with caution

That's it! Wait! One last thing. There are three ways to transfer the vapor from the lung to your lungs.

1. *Leave stem and cap on, take MFLB off and sip through stem.* You can enjoy a relaxed sip on the stem, and you'll even be able to get your lungs full 3-4 times before you have to put the MFLB back on again

2. *Leave cap on, take stem and MFLB off.* I don't recommend this. It just sucks. However as a staunch libertarian I support your right to do this if you so please.

3. *Take cap off, put your mouth on bottle like you're sucking a dick.* Yes. This is the one. Unless you're trying to chill the fuck out, do this one. The bag will snap inward, and the vapor will be propelled directly to the depths of your lungs. Beware coughers and chiefers. Mastering these hits will solidify your Elite Third Lunger status.

**NOW GO MAKE A THIRD LUNG!** Report back with experiences

Questions and discussion below. We sit on the cusp of a new era. The era of not one, not two, but three lungs. It's happening now, live, below.

Also please upvote this. It's a self post so I don't get karma. Upvote for visibility, then more ents will see it, try it, even innovate and report back with methods of improvements. Godspeed!

I spent months pouring over this sub trying to figure out whether it was something I would value.  Well I've had mine only a couple days and can honestly say it has already changed everything.

*It's the future.*

You start playing around with it and you say to yourself ""of course it's this way, how could it be any other way?"" and then you realize you can never go back.

What follows are some of the high points of the device IMO.

- You know that moment where you've just take a huge rip off your favourite glass pipe and you exhale?  You know that sharp burning sensation you get at the back of your throat?  The raspy cutting shards of irritation? No more, gone. Oh you'll still cough, but its an entirely less jarring and painful experience. 

- You know that oppressive smell of charred and immolated plant matter that fills your room/park/wherever and makes you paranoid someone will hassle you?  It is replaced by a soft and inoffensive herbal scent, and few visible signs of any vapor or smoke. 

- You know how you always worry that all your talk about how safe bud is feels disingenuous when you compare it to the amount of combusted butane/matches you've inadvertently inhaled along the way? Well this thing uses the power of freaking ELECTRONS.  Each time you press that battery in milliamps of current rushes into the mesh trough, and within seconds you are enjoying DELICIOUS vape heated to perfection by SUBATOMIC PARTICLES.

I wish I didn't sound like such a commercial, but this thing is hard to hate.  It's beauty in simplicity.

I didn't really like the idea of going behind my parents' backs, but I didn't have another choice at that point. I had it all planned out, I would use the prepaid gift card that I had to pay for it. But when I saw that the MFLB was taken off of amazon, I couldn't buy it from any other place because I already put my money on amazon. So I decided to take a risk.

I decided to tell my parents everything. I told them how I had been regularly smoking, and wanted to buy a vaporizer. It turns out, they were totally cool with it! They said I could get it shipped to the house with their credit card, and they even offered to pay for some of it! Now, I am completely open with my parents, and everything is awesome, thanks to the MFLB being taken off amazon.

We were in a well lit area (though it was fairly dark outside) as the area in LDN that i work is pretty much always floodlit by buildings and other spectacles.

I was hittin the vape slowly on my bike, enjoying the comfort of stealthy vaping, and low and behold, i'm suddenly cycling beside Boris Johnson. 

He's walking along with his aide or whatever, bike helmet in hand, passes a glance at me as i'm still staring trying to work out if i'm just high as balls or if i'm actually taking class B drugs right next to the mayor of london.

I was genuinely right next to the guy and he was none the fuckin wiser.

I wish it was someone i actually liked, though. I never bump into anyone decent.

Now I lost both my car and MFLB and couldn't afford to buy a new box. 

So I tried contacting Magic Flight customer service and explained my story, I told them I made 1 picture of the serial back when I first got the box.  They contacted me back that they usually don't cover lost or stolen boxes, but they judge on a case by case basis.

I send them the picture and they offered to replace my box and flag my old box as stolen! 

I received the box today and they even replaced my batteries because they died on me a while back and my powerex's were stolen with the box.

I would like Magic Flight again for the wonderful customer service and want to let you guys know that they are the best and please keep buying their items!

Putting a bit of kief on top of bud works great its amazing no problems no worries and is a great way to do it. However, I tend to use my kief when I am running low/dry on herb.

Vaping straight kief right off the screen is not a big deal and I do it all the time. Sure, it might melt down and clog the screen up, but I clean my screen on a weekly basis anyway so its really not an issue.

To clean your screen properly, hold down a battery/power adapter for a good 10-15 seconds on an empty trench. This will heat up the screen, and you will probably see vapor/smoke created from residue in your box. Dip your brush in a little bit of Isopropyl and brush the screen with it, I promise you any build up (kief included) will melt away like butter. Once this is done I usually heat it up for 5-10 seconds again once or twice to get rid of any excess alcohol.

I find your best bet to minimize the potential for clogging your screen is to load just a sprinkle of kief in for every hit. If you drop a big fat pile of kief into the trench, some will vape away and some will melt down partially and clog your screen. Just sprinkle a tiny bit in there, vape away, then pack in a little more, and you'll greatly reduce any clogging. Even if a little kief gets clogged in the screen, another hit from the box will vape that stuff up too.

I can't tell you how many times I've seen this argument, and I was super anxious about putting kief in my MFLB even on top of bud for months. I promise you all I do this on a regular basis and its not an issue. Good luck and happy vaping!

The strain is Green Crack, and this trench got me to a nice [6] or [7].  I used the PA on 60-70% power through a small to midsize bubbler with the WPA.  Each hit was about 15-20 seconds.

A few weeks ago, my friend and I decided to meet at our local movie theater to vape and listen to some next-level music. We chose the side parking lot, and were sure to not be in the main pack of cars, but yet not too far off/removed where we'd draw suspicion. We settled on a place maybe 5 parking spots away from the nearest car.

All was going well for about an hour, when I look in the rear view mirror and see a cop bee-lining straight for our car. Definitely not a random patrol, he was moving in such a purposeful manner that he had to responding to a complaint/report.

I was in the middle of a hit on the Launch Box, and I immediately threw the vape towards the pedals, out of site, and warned my friend. At this point, I assumed I was about to be arrested. I began mentally steeling myself for the shit-storm of the next two days.

Luckily our windows were down. The cop pulled in front of us and got out, coming to (thank God) the passenger side window. At this point, I was comfortably a 6 or 7, and probably looked high as a cloud's balls. 

The cop walked up and asked, ""What movie you all seeing tonight?"". I immediately and wildly tried to think up a movie, starting to utter some nonsense, when my friend (whose eyes were not red like mine) ""Hangover 3 at 9:30"". 

The cop said, ""Oh I see, didn't realize that was out yet.""

""It came out yesterday, or technically last night,"" my friend said.

The cop bent down, obviously smelling the car, and asked, ""So there's  no illegal activity going on here? Nothing illegal in the car?""

We both replied, ""No, sir.""

He looked at me, I hesitantly (high as a kite, remember) made eye contact, while thinking, ""And here's the checkmate, it's obvious I'm so high.""

He said, ""Yep,"" and nodded to himself, as if confirming I was high.

Then all of a sudden, he says, ""Well, you two have a good day,"" and walks off.

My heart nearly tore out of my chest, it was rhythmically pumping to the point that it as almost audible.

We ended up going to see the movie because we were scared of him coming back (It was good high --most likely shit sober) and my friend mentioned how frustrating it must have been for the cop, who must have anticipated a clean-cut arrest, was foiled when there was no smell, no visible bongs/pipes/weed (I had thankfully put it in the center console), and while I was visibly high, he couldn't really do much about it. So he left.

And my life was kept from possibly being derailed, as I moved to NY recently for a pretty nice internship. That would have changed that quickly.

On Monday, my family and one of my best friENTs are getting ready to depart on a 5 day vacation to Istanbul. Since its a family trip we probably wouldn't be able to find or smoke anything here, the night before I prepared a little surprise for us- two beautiful, rolled, nutella filled crepes with a gram of abv in each. We're at the check in for our flights (9:30am), we eat our incredible snack, in direct view of my parents and my little brother, no worries. We pass through security, reach our gate, have a cappuccino, and then I begin feeling it (11am). I look over at my friend and we exchange a little smile, and proceed making conversation with my parents. As I stepped in the plane I definitely felt it [4], and it was growing with every minute. We sat in our seats and I was thrilled to see that there was a little tv even for a 2:30 hour flight. I checked what was showing and was even more thrilled to rewatch TDKR baked on a plane. The plane takes off, and at this point I'm at a good [6] (12:30pm) and I look over to my friend and he is fast asleep. I keep watching the movie, fighting the urge to fall asleep myself, as I was determined to watch the full thing. Then a glorious moment arrived, lunch, where I reached the peak of my avb induced state [8]. I swear to any god it was the best fucking rice and chicken I have ever eaten. And it was plane food. We land and I'm beginning to come down, but very slowly. The weather in Istanbul was amazing, and my dad, being the lad he is, has a boat prepared to take us to the hotel. So I'm on this boat (a fucking boat), still high as fuck, with the sun shining, seeing Istanbul for the first time. We arrive at the hotel and my friend and I begin feeling a little tired, and we proceed to go to the hotel spa and pool, where we fall asleep in the relaxation room, to be woken by my father for dinner.

Any comments and helpful criticism is of course accepted. *EDIT: Adjusted time of engaging batteries, just warrantied my MFLB and discovered how hot it used to be, it cooked my bud in half as many hits as my old Box.



**How to make your ceilings lower with the glorious MFLB**

1. Grind your weed super fine, like sand particle fine. Use your normal grinder to get it loose then dump the bud into a pill bottle with a coin in it and shake the fuck out of that thing. Load the trench.

2. Put in a freshly charged Powerex (freshly charged meaning just got a green indicator).

3. Go native aka don't use the included glass stem. Put the stem somewhere safe for use later, but for now we're trying to get your ass high.

4. Hold the battery in, start inhaling at the 3 second mark just fast enough to move air, but not so much that you can hear air being pulled through. Keep inhaling for 10 to 15 seconds or until lungs are full or trench is too hot. Disengage battery. WARNING: Engaging battery for longer then 20 seconds tremendously increases the risk of combustion which is BAD.

5. Hold hit in for about 10 seconds. Exhale.

6. Shake Box and flip load if necessary (sometimes the load can stick to the screen, if it does, knock hard on the back of the Box or take a paperclip and make a mini spatula with it). Repeat steps 4 through 6 until your load is a rich brown.

7. *Sit there wondering how the fuck you got so high with something so simple and beautiful.* If you still aren't ""there"" yet, load up another trench.

8. When you've returned to Earth (or are ready to load a new trench), dump the roasted bud into a mason jar. Use a gram or two of this to put on a cracker with nutella for nights you don't feel like going through the Magic Flight ritual to get baked.",,False,self,t5_2rs76,1361002807.0,,,True,t3_18m9uq,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/18m9uq/for_all_of_those_still_wondering_how_to_get_super/,

My wife doesn't smoke/vape, but she's fine with me doing it as long as she isn't bothered by the smell. We were watching some TV, me on the couch, her at the desk about 4 feet from me. I decide to take the MFLB for a spin. My box was already loaded with a trench full, so alls I did was open up the tin, grab the LB, a battery and my stem and go to town. I took several hits, exhaling into a blanket that I had on the couch. No sploof, no spray, no towels under the door. Just an IKEA comforter.  After finishing up, I put everything away (somehow spilling about a g of AVB on the blanket) and continued living my life. After a couple of minutes had passed I asked her if she had smelled anything, her answer was none at all. 
The moral of the story is my wife has terrible a sense of smell.  ",,False,self,t5_2rs76,False,,,True,t3_vxvud,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/vxvud/to_those_wondering_about_the_smell/,

Seriously, I don't smoke at all now, my MFLB gets me 5x more stoned. If I was to smoke it'd take me about .5 to get to about a [4/5] but now my vape will get me AND a friend to like [6/7] after about .2! This thing is awesome! And it hits beautifully, the vapor is so smooth you can take much bigger hits and it tastes so much better.
Few things I've learnt since ive had it:

* The smell is not as discrete as some people say. If i was to vape indoors people would definitely tell. However if I just go out to my garage to vape the smell dissipates almost instantly.

* ALWAYS use elastic bands. If you don't and you have the box in your pocket or something then your herb finds its way under the screen and its a bitch to get out sometimes. I've never had it come open in my  pocket but I've heard of it happening to people, just wrap an elastic band around it and it'll be fine.

* The grind makes more difference than you think. First few times I used it I just stuck the bud through my normal 3 piece but after i heard that the finer grind was better I tried it and I could tell the difference. I couldn't find a pill bottle so I used the toy container from a kinder egg and a 5p (I'm British). Shake the fuck out of it for about 1 minute and you get a really fine grind.

* AVB is stronger than you think. I ate about .5g of and left it an hour and felt nothing. So I ate another .5 and about 10 minutes later the first dose kicked in. Fast forward to an hour later and I'm gone, easy [9]. Woke up for college 8 hours later still at a [2] with red eyes. Not good.

If you are thinking of buying an MFLB I would definitely recommend doing so! The things probably paid for its self already. I only use around .2 each time I get high now and my bud lasts so much longer. The health benefits are obvious too.

I had never used one before and I had read that there was a learning curve with using it right, so I was ready for my first experience to not be great, but boy was I wrong.

The first thing I noticed was the taste.  The smoke actually tasted good!  Not harsh, but just a normal marijuana flavor, with a little minty taste to it (might have just been this batch).

The next thing I noticed was how smooth the hit was.  Now don't get me wrong, the hits on my bong were quite smooth as well (20"" bong with ice tends to be pretty darn smooth), but the MFLB is just straight up better.  The first hit made me want to cough a tiny bit, but I didn't even cough.  The second hit was harder, so I coughed a bit, but still much smoother than my bong.

After the first two hits I decided to take a break and see how high I got, because I don't really like to get to a [10] or whatever, I just want to feel nice and toasted.  After a few minutes, I was feeling just as high off of those two hits as I was from the two bong hits that it took to completely use up the bowl in my bong.

Of course the high experience itself was different.  I know everyone says that vaporizers have a more ""heady"" high, and that's definitely accurate.  For me, when I'm baked, I'll get really still, and when I move my head, the rest of my body tends to continue to feel ""paralyzed"".  With this vaporizer, my body doesn't feel like that any more.  I still get the ""get really still"" part, but when I come out of it, it's much clearer.

Then I got the best realization.  I had put less weed into this thing then I put into my bong, and not only that, I had tons left in the trench, it was only slightly golden in some spots, lots of green still to go!  The high only lasted about 3/4 of the time it normally does with my bong, but that's more then made up by taking a few more hits near the end to keep it going.

All in all I am thoroughly amazed at this little device.  Speaking of that, how tiny is this fucking thing!  Every review and post about getting one said that, so I was prepared for it to be small, but it still took me by surprise!  It's barely taller/wider then a standard bic lighter, and even a bit shorter!

tl;dr - Only two hits, and I'm already in love.  Vaporizers are the way to go, and the MFLB is amazing.",,False,self,t5_2rs76,False,,,True,t3_107xjn,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/107xjn/went_from_a_bong_to_the_mflb_and_its_such_an/,

Love mine despite it being clear and not darker plastic to block sun. 

Anyway, when you order one, you also get a few ""nugtainers,"" which are like those little plastic cups those $0.25 toy vending machines have. In fact, now that I just thought of that, there's an option to check in to but the jar is still pretty neat and recommended. Back to the point, these cups just so happen to fit around the hole in the MFLB *perfectly,* like they were made for each other. 

This means it's easy to do ""on the go"" swaps or dump your ABV between trenches. Took a few photos to demonstrate:

[First put the upside down cup over and into the hole.](http://i.imgur.com/GlsZU.jpg)

[Turn upside down.](http://i.imgur.com/wSIV7.jpg)

Remove cup, put cover on cup and voila! Easy way to change out meds without making a mess. You can even have another container with fresh herb to do the same process for one handed loading for full discreetness. They pop in with just enough force to give you confidence without making your worry about damaging the o-ring or screen, although I wouldn't get too carried away testing that last one.

Also took a few more photos while I was at it...

Also, for those of you needing to replace your cleaning brush, check the men's shaving section around the electronic razors or check your/your SO's razor bag to see if it has one in it. Some even have two different brushes which helps cleaning the edges, which seem to gather more.

~~-~~

&gt;Bluethinder1: How big is the enjoyjjar itself, if you don't mind me asking? It's hard to get a frame of reference with most of the pictures I've seen...

I looked around for a tape measure but I couldn't find one so I took a few photos with items I'm sure you've seen/used/own. Maybe later if these don't help I can look more for a measure or if you have something else you specifically want to see, let me know. I wasn't out there long as the bee or whatever it was brought friends soon after his departure. Seems he rather liked the leftover trichs and material from the buds I've had in there even though he stumbled a bit while trying to take off (seriously, it was rather funny). 

[Hope these help.](http://imgur.com/a/OC1F0)

Further, they say it holds half an ounce but depending on nug size, you may have overflow. The Zig-Zags fit very tightly but the JuicyJays have to obviously fold a bit however I don't store mine in there. A mini-Bic will fit into a compartment but a regular size will not. Short 78mm joints fit, longer joints/cones/blunts will not. Each holds an 1/8th very nicely with room to view. I try to treat my buds nicely and prevent cramming them all together too tightly. I'll keep three compartments decently filled with the forth holding a brush, some nugtainers, joints or whatever and anything left stays at home until needed. I take the jar with me literally everywhere I go and I ride a motorcycle so space is always at a premium but it's just that handy and nice, especially if you have multiple strains at a time.

The compartments are not ""smell-tight"" either, which may matter to weedsnobs (you know who you are). Smells will intermix but potent strains maintain their aroma. Store used joints in airtight containers (cigarette cellophane burned together with a lighter works in a pinch) or the entire thing will reek of the burnt smell and takes a bit of time to leave. This does not mean it is not smell-proof or lets off a hardcore weed smell when stored. It does mask the smell but I don't want to say entirely because then someone will think they can use it without getting busted. It does a good job, put it that way. Airtight? My nugs eventually get a bit drier but much less than when stored in plastic bags, even Ziplocs. I'm not overly anal about always returning the lid *immediately* after nug retrieval either, though.

So, I don't have much conclusive material, but I felt that some people might find this interesting, useful or just entertaining.

**Notes:** 
I smoked quite a bit over 420, was pretty much high from 9:00 AM the day of until I went to sleep on 4/21 (Saturday). I was sober all day 4/22 (Sunday), until about 11:43 PM, when this begins. My tolerance is probably low-moderate, and I primarily use the MFLB (though over the weekend I smoked, ate, vaped a plethora of ways). 

The following is completely unedited, except for maybe a few notes that will be made **bold**.

___________________________________

Hit 1: (11:43)
pretty damn sober [0]

Hit 2: (11:45)
still pretty sober [0.5]

Hit 3: (11:47)
Still feeling sober with hints of high [1]
lights seem SLIGHTLY more intense

Hit 4: (11:52)
Definitely not flying, but thoughts are slower, lights are a bit brighter. [1]

Hit 5: (11:55)
Definitely feeling some effects here. [2-3]

Hit 6: (12:00)
I forgot to write this one **NOTE : I was probably approaching a [4] here.**

Hit 7: (12:04)
Small hit, kinda. [4]

Hit 8: (12:09)
That was a good one. [5]

Hit 9: (12:11)
Feeling some munchies set in, though I haven't eaten dinner so that could be why too. Colors are great. Sounds beginning to ""feel"".

PS laughing for no reason.
[6]

Hit 10: (12:14)
Talking to another high friend. Not really listening. I'm trying to! [6]

Hit 11: (12:18)
Really hungry. Words are slower. [6.5]

first touch of paranoia.

Hit 12: (12:21)
Time is slowed quite a bit. Words even slower and thoughts too. [7]

New Trench/New Battery

Hit 13: (12:27)
Tasty. Okay guys, we're high for sure. Not flying. But we might be soon. [6.6] (edit: I realize I said 7 last hit, but I overestimated... let's say 6 something before)

Hit 14: (12:29)
nice hit. steadily climbing now. typing becoming a task. I'm  not playing any music, I'm talking to a friend on skype, but usually music would make typing even more overwhelming right now. Basically, I'm doing just an okay job of typing this and talking to my friend. I sound so high. [6.89532]

Hit 15: (12:31)
That was one of those hits where I could feel the drop happening you know? I'm pretty hungry. [7]

Hit 16: (12:35)
Super hungry. blurry vision (dried contacts). Typing so hard guys.

Hit 17: (12:39)
Just spent a while talking about how terrible Nancy Botwin is. But how much I love her anyway.
[7]

Hit 18: (

__________________________________

The night did not end at Hit 18, and it wasn't that I couldn't type but simply that I forgot what I was doing after typing the opening parentheses. I probably ended up about an [8] no more than three hits later, where I think I stopped. Looking back, time seemed much slower over this whole process.

As you can see, I only used two trenches, and my trenches are always quite under-filled and roasted to a medium brown with green flecks. To guesstimate, my trenches are about .1g at the most, I probably vaped about .28 grams in total last night. 

Conclusion, MFLB is fucking effective. My herb is also pretty awesome, but that's a side note.

Hope this accomplished something.

**Update: Here's an image of Trench #2. I didn't snap one of Trench #1, but it was just roughly larger than this, perhaps just enough to cover the bottom of the trench.  Here's the link: [Trench #2 Image](http://imgur.com/bVPe5)**

I will end this in one week, then it will go onto r/trees

**EDIT:**
I will call out winners after this weekend, to give a chance for all to submit thier entries. (9:30pm 6/20)

Down to 23

Here are the categories:

    1) Good Guy Greg award. Take a pic of you doing a good deed. Does NOT have to involve trees. Top 6 of my likings win a shovel. Bonus points if you help out the geriatric population.

    2) MFLB best art. Show a pic of your creations/modifications you have made DIRECTLY onto your LB, not accessories attachments, pure art. Top 6 of my likings win a shovel.

    3) Stoner Engineering with the MFLB. Show a pic of your MacGuyver, 1st year Mechanical Engineering skills. Does not mean you must modify your LB, rather what you attached to it. Top 6 of my likings win a shovel.

this won't change how i post here, i'll still politely (for the most part), urge submitters here to refrain from irrelevant posts on the front page and/or encourage them to *add* content to those posts that lack any.

Hold the battery in to the count of 4 to 6, depending on battery charge and ""greenness"" of the trench.

2. Hold the MFLB close to your mouth native style, with your mouth open.  This is key - DO NOT MAKE A SEAL WITH YOUR LIPS.  Just let your top lip and bottom lip touch the box, but don't make a seal.

3. Inhale slowly through your mouth.  You will feel like you are only drawing air from around the box, but you are also bringing in the goodness from within the box, I promise.  By not making a seal, it is almost impossible to pull too much air into the box and cool the screen.  It IS possible to combust while doing this, so go ahead and get done with it but just not too fast.

4. Hold it for a count of 3 (2 seconds, no more) and let out a little bit.  If you see vapor, then top off your lungs with air and hold another couple seconds.  Try to exhale again, just a little.  Once again, if you see vapor then top off your lungs with air.  Do this only a couple times.

it DOES NOT use alkaline batteries, and will in fact NOT WORK with them at all. it requires rechargeable Nickle metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries, rated at least as 2000mAh (low self discharge), but works best with 2400+mAh high discharge batteries.  
and why do you list night vision as not being available? it has nothing to do with a vaporizer ... at all.  
i field many questions about these inequities in your listing. you get accused of selling knockoffs quite a lot because of this, and i must reassure people that despite these problems, that you do actually sell the real thing, and at very good prices. i think your sales might improve a bit if this was corrected, because when people who know about the box read your listing, they just pass you by as cashing in on MFLB's quality and selling a knockoff.  
we'd both benefit from a few corrections. me, by not having to constantly defend you ... and you by increasing your sales.  
i'd appreciate your looking into this. thanks.  
  
  
... we'll see what happens.

Each trench I pack is usually 0.2g. So now $55/3.5g = 15.7 bucks per g. Now 15.7/5 = 3.14 bucks per trench. But really it only takes half a trench to get me to a (6). So really its $1.57 for a good session with my MFLB. But here comes the kicker. I save the AVB and make brownies with them. So for 1g each brownies I get 3.5 brownies every 1/8th. I sell the brownies for ~$8/each at parties and whatnot therefore I make $28 back per 1/8.

I'm going to take out all of the boring math and tell you that since I sell brownies back out and my net cost is decreased from 55 to $27, it costs me a total of $0.77 for a good toking session. 

And this is why the MFLB stands for Mother Fucking Loveable Beast.

One of the main reasons that many of us have an MFLB is to keep our habits a secret from certain people (family, law enforcement, etc.). Another main reason is mobility. Smoking anywhere, anytime without anyone knowing is a beautiful thing. On a bus? Down a trench. At the in-laws' house? Down a trench. In class? Down a trench. At the police station? Down a trench. Yet, these little boxes are too large of an investment to be careless about. Lifetime warranty doesn't cover theft or confiscation. In order to protect ourselves and our little boxes of wonder, we must be stealthy. We must be tree-ninjas.

Use this thread to post your ninja stories and provide some tips on how to be more stealthy with your vape.

**My tip for stealth native vaporizing:** Do not hold the MFLB between your thumb and forefinger. Instead, cup your hand over it with your palm facing downwards. The bottom of your palm will push the battery while your fingers push the box. Bring your hand to your mouth as you pull. Seen from the front, it looks like you are yawning, or just holding your hand to your face. If you do this well enough, the only angle from which the MFLB will be visible is from the bottom. I use this trick to vape on the bus.

1332530950.0,50,self.mflb,rae7v,Got an MFLB yesterday. Have had Volcano for years...my thoughts.,Anon08764,55,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/rae7v/got_an_mflb_yesterday_have_had_volcano_for/,"I have no idea how to cross post, so I am just re-posting here.

I've had a volcano for years.  I'm a weekend vapehead.  Generally about once, sometimes twice a week I'll get myself to a nice [7] or so and watch some funny TV (just discovered Trailer Park Boys, thanks /r/trees!).  I'm also a serious insomniac, so on occasion, right before bed I would fire up my proto-pipe from the bedside table and take a couple of hits and knock myself out for the night.

My wife, after a nasty coughing fit told me to buy myself some kind of bedside vaporizer.  I had been thinking about it for a while and as a [/r/trees](/r/trees) lurker, I decided the time had come to purchase an MFLB.  

I'm a complete geek and love gadgets, I also want to always get the most I can get out of any gadget, so I watched a ton of MFLB videos in order to see how to properly use it.  The videos at their official site pretty much did the trick.

So, I wanted to do a quick comparison of the two devices.  As everyone is aware, the Volcano is the reigning king of vaporizers.  I love my Volcano.  Put in about a quarter gram, ground nice and fine and fill up a couple of balloons for my wife and I and we'll have a great evening of watching movies (we are partial to comedy and action/adventure or sci-fi) or TV (we generally stick to comedy for our Volcano nights, Community, Black Books, The IT Crowd, Happy Endings, Psych, etc).  Throughout the night we pause and chat and laugh our asses off and make popcorn (using this: http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-CPM-950-EasyPop-Popcorn-Maker/dp/B004VS31W6   - Yes it is pricey, but it is AWESOME. WAY better than microwave and over time it pays for itself since the kernels are way cheaper).

I love having the fine grain control over the heat that the Volcano provides (I have the analog version, the digital wasn't yet available).  This allows me to finely tune the thickness of the vapor and slowly ramp up the heat as I vape the herb. The Volcano is a terrific device and when my current one finally dies, I'll buy another.

Now, that said, the MFLB is one GREAT device.  I about half filled a trench last night (maybe 0.1 grams).  I ground the herb as finely as I could and I followed the instructions from the video as best I could.  The first hit was a miss, but the second was good and the third pretty much perfect.  Great job on the instructions guys!  I'm sure that for a new Ent it would be a bit trickier but I've got over 20 years of toking behind me so it wasn't hard to figure out.  

I found the little LED to be a key component as it let me know exactly when I was actually heating the element and when i had released.  The quality of the high was great, same as the Volcano. I got myself to about a [6] and watched the movie Clue and laughed my ass off.  

I was surprised by how small the device is, pleasantly so.  It's silent, and nowhere near as big a production as the Volcano is.  This thing will be great for outdoor use and fantastic for when we want to go out for a movie to our local (within walking distance) theater.

All of that said, it won't replace the Volcano for my nights with the wife.  If you don't have the money for the Volcano or something similar, or if you want something you can easily use on the go, the MFLB is one helluva nice little vaporizer.  At that price point, I'm not sure that you could do better.  The company was fast, responsive and the whole package is great (the storage tin is a great replacement for the tupperware container that I was using in my nightside table). 

I found it easy to use, it does a great job and left me with some nice ABV.  I could probably take the ABV and toss it in the volcano and get a bit more out of it, but I like to cook with my ABV, so I'll probably just get slightly more powerful baked goods out of the deal, which isn't a bad thing!

I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have.  Big thumbs up from me on the MFLB.  I'm planning on getting my GGG dealer an MFLB for Christmas.",,False,self,t5_2rs76,False,,,True,t3_rae7v,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/rae7v/got_an_mflb_yesterday_have_had_volcano_for/,

First off it's $10 for 5 stems, and they are all different in size and ""shape"".  I had broken mine and was using a straw, which really didn't fit in there and was letting a decent amount of vapor out (wasting bud).  3 out of the 5 stems are longer and so I decided to use one of them.  I read somewhere before that coughing is related to how short the original stem is because you get high temps going down your throat.  Well the longer stems definitely helped and I have yet to cough.  Also, since they are longer when you clear them out, you get monster hits.  Shipping speed was timely as well(one of my pet peeves).  Definitely a good buy, for $10 you will get 5 more stems which are legit.

1328689117.0,49,self.mflb,pg0pz,Two months in and I need to clear something up: the MFLB DOES smell,NowiElevate,63,14,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/pg0pz/two_months_in_and_i_need_to_clear_something_up/,"I see a lot of people here in r/mflb touting ""no smell"" as one of the MFLB's features. I have been using it regularly for almost 2 months now and I can tell you that it actually smells quite a bit (unless I'm wrong and my BC weed is way danker than anyone's here). Now don't get me wrong, compared to smoking it is nothing, but in your average normal sized room, it still creates quite a smell. 


Again, some people say ""it does smell but it smells like burnt popcorn"" which is true, the weed that is getting closer and closer to combusting smells like burnt popcorn. 

The thing is if you've gotten to that point already then your room already smells like weed and the popcorn smell isn't going to cover it up, on top of that, the burnt popcorn smell still has quite a weed scent to it.



I always read people using the MFLB in theatres and libraries and such. I can't imagine doing that, it smells quite a bit, also simply having a loaded mflb on you emanates quite a smell. 

Now, despite the fact that the vapor does in fact smell quite a bit, even when held in for upwards of 30 seconds, the smell is very easy to avoid. Here's my tip, as long as you exhale the vapor through a sploof or a sweater or even if you just put a towel under your door, you're golden. Vapor is much easier to control than stinky smoke which emanates everywhere.

As you may recall, I posted an image of those ABV/peanut butter sandwiches a couple of days ago, and promised to report back with how they day went, so without further ado, here it is!

-----------

**11:15** - I arrive at my friends (Liam) house to pick him up, we're both pretty excited at this point because he hasn't done edibles before. He has been asking me a lot of questions like ""What kind of high is it?"" and ""How long does it usually take to kick in?"", however he is a heavy smoker so I knew he would most likely understand the high and be fine with it.

**11:25** - We both arrive at the train station and park our car. The best part about edibles is that you don't really have to hide it, because it looks like you're carrying around your breakfast. We jump straight on the first train waiting to leave, both very excited about the day.

**11:35** - Train leaves the station and we begin our 40 minute journey into the city. Our station is at the end of the line, so this was the perfect time to eat the sandwiches because not many people were on the train yet.

**11:40** - Train arrives at the second station, I decide to tuck into my sandwich at this point. The taste is suprisingly easy to handle, kinda just tastes like crunchy peanut butter with a very slight after taste of weed. As I'm eating it Liam is telling me how it kinda smells a little, so I make sure to eat fast. Once I'm done with mine he begins to devour his. 

**11:46** - Sandwiches are both consumed.

**12:10** - After much waiting I think I'm starting to feel something, although it may just be the placebo effect. I accidentally forgot to eat that morning; I'm unsure if that could have been a contributing factor toward how fast the high came on for me or not. I start to feel the good vibes while Liam isn't quite yet, however he ate his sandwich 5 minute after I ate mine.

**12:20** - We get off at our train stop and I definately feel it in the background now. I was probably about a [2], nothing too intense but just good feels. On the way to the ferry, I start to notice how cool the city looks. I noticed a tree and thought that the leafless skeleton up against a tall building looked very cool. At this point it was starting to build up for Liam, and his [0] has begin to rise.

**12:30** - We made it to the ferry port and we see that it's about 10 minutes away which is great, so we take a seat and admire the lake. We are both dribbling a little bit of shit to each other, but it's pretty logical dribble. I almost feel as if we were in the transition phase at this point, as we noticed each others behavior change a little.

**12:44** - The ferry arrives and we head onto it. I feel a little uncomfortable getting on, being amongst a crowd of people weirded me out for some reason. I usually have no problem with it.

**12:46** - We hear the ferrys engine fire up, we both agree it sounds pretty strange. We are both also starting to notice the subtle background noises; people talking, the water crashing against the side of the boat, all of it.  Somehow we begin a conversation about why they put a ferry service along this small lake, and why they didn't just put a bridge along it.

**12:49** - We are almost off the ferry began to discuss just how wierd of a creature jellyfish are. I mean, how do they move around with seemingly no brain? How do they control their tentacles? They are pretty much just a clear filament in the water! It was then decided that if a jellyfish had brains and had the ability to chase humans in packs, you would be fucked.

**12:50** - We head off the train and start the 2 minute walk to the zoo!

**12:53** Liam wants to stop for a cigarette before we go in as you can't smoke in the zoo. We sit down on a nice bench right near the entrance, but oh no! He must have dropped his papers! Damn. ""Do you think theres a bottle shop close?"". We then look to our left and sure enough, right across the road there is one! Very lucky.

**12:58** Liam is half way through his cigarette and we are both very eagerly awaiting the zoo. It's safe to say we're both floating around a [4] at this point. 

**1:00** - We pay our entry fee and enter the zoo. We are both pretty high at this point, I decide to be the pioneer and make the executive decision that we need to get a map. Luckily we find the small information kiosk where we buy a map from a very, very attractive young blonde girl and a woman old enough to be her grandmother. They are very friendly and joke around with us, something that I would normally enjoy. However, we were both pretty paranoid and didn't want to give it away. We really just wanted to get the map and leave.

**1:02** - After deciphering the map we decided to start at the reptile house and move on up through the zoo. I noticed that the zoo was cleverly laid out in a way that you could pretty much take one route through the zoo and get through all of the exhibits.

**1:05** - Inside the reptile house there are plenty of snakes. We got very wierded out by one snake who was standing himself up, looking directly at us. We were reaaaaaly freaked out by this dude, and decided to bail on the snakes and head over to the turtles. Oh man the turtles. We both agreed that turtles must smoke weed everyday, they were just so ridiculously slow, dopey and chilled. As we are watching them, the 2 turtles that have been hanging around each other all of the sudden swim toward one another and hold hands, then they swim around in a circle while they are hanging onto each other. ""DUDE THEYRE HOLDING HANDS"" says liam. Yep, we were both pretty in awe of the turtles after that.

**1:15** - Upon exiting the reptile house we are greeted with the warm sun rays on our face, feels good man. We figured we should probably do the Australian Bushwalk first and leave the really interesting animals (Lions, tigers, elephants etc) to last, to make sure we see them around the peak of our edible high. But before the bushwalk we needed to graze through the wetlands first!

**1:20** - Inside the wetlands is a strange feeling, there are birds just co-existing with one another, I think to myself that they must all be pretty good buddies. However, the birds are not the main attraction of this area. Our zoo has a really old, gigantic croc which we were pumped for. Once we got to his tank, he was nowhere to be seen! Then we notice a sign that says he is in a reserve area while his habitat is being cleaned out. We go through the door where it directs us, and find him in an outside grasses area with a pool, basking in the sun! He looked so wierdly scary and we were talking to each other about how crocodiles are basically nightmare fuel, this guy was insanely muscley and evil looking at the time. Pretty cool. 

**1:40** - We begin our journey through the Australian Walkabout. No animals are really exciting to us, we see Kangaroos pretty often because we're Australian ourselves. The Koalas were a spin out though, they were actually climbing around the tree and moving, which you hardly ever see them do! Liam also pointed out how we had found another animal that smokes daily.

**2:00** - After a very long walk through the Australian section, we enter the Asia area where we see lots of exotic monkeys and birds. We found these one species of monkeys that were so ridiculously small, which tripped us out because we both watched them for about 20 seconds before we realised that they were actually small and not just far away. We went through this area fairly fast because it's pretty much all monkeys and birds.

**2:20** - We start making our way back towards the main area because we are both very hungry at this point. We get side tracked by a sign that directs us toward the Numbats. We really needed to see what a numbat looked like in real life, because neither of us has ever seen one in real life before. Unfortunately, the habitat was closed and they weren't there ;(. Very dissapointed.

**2:25** - We grab a bite to eat. The zoo food was horrible and overpriced, but neither of us really cared that much at this point because we were high as balls. I bought a burger and Liam bought a Pie. He definitely had the better meal. It felt good to sit down for a rest because we had walked quite a long way. Upon sitting down we definately both noticed how high we actually were, probably about a [6]-[7]. We finish our meal and decide it's time to tackle the African Savannah!

**2:35** - We begin making our way through the area, going past some minor animals. Then we see them. The Baboons. Fuck, these are some strange monkeys. We were both noticing their mannerisms, and we chatted for a while about how similar they are to humans, and how smart they actually are. We notice a few people with DSLR Cameras, and after a few minutes of decoding the situation we come to the conclusion that the old guy taking photos actually has a photography class with him, and is teaching them. Then out of fucking nowhere, the old guy starts making weird noises and waving his arms, in an attempt to wind the crowd of Baboons up. The first time he does it they all get very very hostile and aggressive toward the man, all the time I'm calculating the odds of a monkey being able to jump out of it's habitat and rip the man to shreds, because that's looks like what they wanted to do. We watch for a little longer while the photographer keeps making weird noises, but the monkeys eventually become dis-interested in him. No more than a minute later a zoo keeper comes along side the groups of people and begins throwing them some food (some sort of dried up meat I think). She notices the photographer making these weird noises and tells him to back off. She owned him which we both felt good about, haha.

1349655613.0,46,self.mflb,1141kk,The Amazing Efficiency of the Launch Box,tyzon05,56,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/1141kk/the_amazing_efficiency_of_the_launch_box/,"The MFLB has really helped me conserve and save quite a lot of money.  It's really amazing how this little box can pay for itself.  

before owning the MFLB I had similar patterns of consumption to those I have now.  I would smoke a bowl before bed on the weekdays and one to two on the weekends.  For the sake of the math I'll overestimate and say 10 bowls per week.  With an average bowl size of .25g that's 2.5g a week and 10g a month.

After buying the MFLB I've slowly transitioned into the patterns I have now.  I still consume 9-10 times per week, (we'll call it 10 again for the sake of the calculations), and I would rate my enjoyment as the same if not higher compared to when I was smoking.  My average trench sits around .15g (again, overestimating slightly to get a maximum), and I now consume half a trench per day.  (I still consume twice a day sometimes; I just use one-forth of a trench per session rather than my usual half a trench).  This adds up to .075g per session (though on twice a day days it's .0375g a session), .525g per week, and a staggering 2.1g per month.

I'm not new to cannabis; I've been partaking for several years and have enjoyed daily consumption for over a year now.  At one point, (about a 3 month period), I was going through 2-4 bowls per day with occasional days in which I would go through grams upon grams with friends.  As you can see, I built up a tolerance.  This goes to demonstrate that my pattern isn't only viable for those with a low tolerance.  

Let's compare the numbers for the same amount of sessions smoking and vaping. 

Average month vaping: 2.1g (~ $21 at the local dispensary).

Average month smoking: 10.0g (~ $100 at the local dispensary).

This comes out to a monthly saving of $79.  The Magic Flight Launch Box is currently on Amazon for $76.75, meaning in less than a month for will have paid for your box.  This means that every year I'm saving $948 dollars that can go towards other things, like accessories, bud, etc. 

Now, I understand I have an abnormally low amount of consumption per session, but let me say I enjoy my sessions now more than I did when I was smoking a full bowl every time.  If anyone is on the fence about purchasing the MFLB, take the plunge.  It's absolutely revolutionized how I get medicated and has overall made it a much more enjoyable process.  If you're thinking ""I couldn't possibly get medicated to the degree I want with that little cannabis"", give it a try.  I thought the same thing until I tried it and to my surprise it turned out to be really viable and save me a ton of money and bud. 

**Tl;dr:** I was able to cut my consumption down to almost 20% of what I used to consume without sacrificing any sessions for a total savings of $948 a year.  If you're on the fence about purchasing the MFLB, do it; you won't regret it.",,False,self,t5_2rs76,False,,mastermflb,True,t3_1141kk,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/1141kk/the_amazing_efficiency_of_the_launch_box/,

We were overwhelmed by your incredible response to our Water Pipe Whip giveaway post. Thank you for taking the time to express your thoughts, feelings and creativity. It has been greatly inspiring. We wish that we had the time to respond to each comment individually. There were so many comments that it has taken us an extra day to review each and every submission. After thoughtful contemplation, we concluded that awarding just 25 Water Pipe Whips was simply not enough to express our appreciation, and decided to more than triple the originally planned amount. It is very exciting for us to have the opportunity to give back to a community that has shared so much of their time and energy with us. 

Here at Magic-Flight we are committed to practicing a conscious, sustainable, and inspired business style.  We hope to effect positive change by modeling a new way of doing business; a way that is more enjoyable for us as a community at large, and for us as a company.  Comments like the ones you left us over the weekend keep us enthusiastic in our heartfelt pursuit to always choose on the basis of love.  

 To all of the winners: please expect a private message in your inbox at some point today or tomorrow.  It will contain a link to a short form for you to fill in your name, email address, and shipping information.  Your prizes will begin shipping next week.  We ask that you please contain your excitement and not post a screenshot of the PM, however, if you do choose to post a screenshot, we ask that you please do not include the link to the form.

Love,

The next morning I woke up at [10]. I somehow managed to drive to work where for the rest of the day I managed to calm down to a [4]. I just want to say for the record, feeling [4] at work in my opinion is optimal. You are feeling good but still have enough wit about yourself to get things done.

Now we move to today. Woke up and was right around [1], [2] ish. The only conclusion that I can draw, AWESOME. I do want to note that I'm of those guys who enjoys the ride so to speak. The climb was pretty intense but if you just enjoy the ride, you'll end up happy.

My brother and I were vaping on my brand new mflb that just landed 2 days ago and just loving the experience every bit when a discussion pops up.
Hear me out : Is it completely unlikely that the Magic flight customer service is so kickass and their lifetime warranties are so effin awesome coz they're a group of stoners just hanging out who happen to have a very successful business going. Picture you and your friends getting blazed on some primo dank when a customer calls up and says ""My dog ate my launch box, can i get a replacement please?"". Wouldn't you do the only humane thing one can do for a fellow ent who is currently ""vapularly"" challenged and go ""Sure thing maan. Where you at?""

Tl;dr : Could it be that Magic Flight has such kickass customer service and such effin awesome lifetime warranties cos they're blazed all the time (especially when dealing with customers)

An excellent seven day orbit with the MFLB. This little gadget has come in very handy over the week and as I predicted in my earlier report, it has taken the place of my one hitter. Have learned the best ""stealth"" hold for me is in my right hand, curling my fingers around the box, pushing the battery in with the heel of my hand while supporting the bottom with my pinky finger. The box does not need to be held level during a hit, as far as I can tell. I'd been using it native for most of the week but decided to employ the stem during the last couple of days because the hot vapor does make me cough. I'd avoided the stem because of feeling as if I had to break down the box between each hit so the stem didn't fly out as I was shaking the box to tumble the herb, but I realized I could pinch the stem between my thumb and finger as I shake the box and everything stays nice and safe and pushed together.

Last week's adventure with AVB was a flop, barely felt a buzz. I had about 1 1/2 grams mixed in with frozen yogurt. I was disappointed but not surprised as I have not had great luck with edibles before (though I have to confess I thought that was due to the ineptitude of the cooks, now I'm thinking I might just be one of those humans edibles don't affect very much). I am diligently saving AVB, though, and plan to try it again with a higher dose in a couple of weeks. Will include it in the report when the time comes.

Now I've got a few trenches' worth of herb ground up and ready for this sunshine-filled afternoon and I'm planning on taking a few hours of shore leave, as I've been relatively productive on the ship this morning. Hope you're all enjoying the advent of Earth spring as much as I am.

Cheers, fellow humans.

I had been at my parents home for a month recovering from my 3rd (and hopefully final) knee surgery, all stemming from a few wakeboarding injuries. 

My roommate picked me up and instead of heading to our apartment, I was somehow coaxed into picking up 30 rack of Hamm's and proceeding to a house party that a co-worker of his was throwing. I was only hesitant due to my knee still being in a straight brace and that fact that I was relying heavily on my crutches for mobility. I thought I would just be a nuisance to the rest of the party and end up hurting my knee.

However, to my surprise I ended up having a great time. I found myself a nice lawn chair and a cold beer, and starting meeting all of these random people I had never seen before. Everyone turned out to be really cool. I had a feeling there were redditors amongst them. 

It all started when I had to crutch up a flight of stairs to find a bathroom. As I was passing the first bedroom at the top of the stairs I was offered trees by a guy chilling on the bed. I had just dipped out of a lengthy conversation outside, primarily to relieve my poor bladder that had put up with day drinking and eating bbq all day. I told the guy I had to pee really bad but I would absolutely take him up on his offer.

After returning from the can, I sat down, and introduced myself to this good samar**ENT**on. He ended up being really cool, and we invited others to join as they walked by. After a nice sesh, we headed downstairs and back outside to join the rest of the party. After heading inside slightly buzzed and full off bbq, getting lifted and then returning back outside into the beautiful late may day...it was almost reminiscent to when Dorothy and Toto, open the door to Munchkinland, and everything turns to color from black and white. (and I hope everyone starting hearing ""Money"" - Pink Floyd in their heads after I painted that picture) 

I immediately walked up to a group of guys that were friends with one of the people that joined the sesh after me in the house. They were all from the midwest and were visiting a buddy of theirs that lived in town. Somehow the topic of trees came up, and I decided to ask a simple question that takes this story from ""TL;DR"" to ""Brought a tear to my eyes."" 

Side note...I had been a regular redditor for about 6 months, and an ent since high school. I had recently seen all of these pics plastered all over /r/trees featuring this weird little wooden box. I eventually learned from the comments from other ents asking the same question? ""What is that little thing?"" I then starting subscribing to /r/mflb to learn more. I was pretty positive I was going take the plunge and place an order. I was even going to buy it from www.magicflight.com at full price, because I respected the company that much after reading an AMA with the inventor of the device.

Back to party...I asked the group of new found fri**ENTs** if they had every heard of a ""Magic Flight Launch Box"" before. The guy that lived in town spoke up and said, ""YEA! I have one! It's awesome! . . . Do you want it?"" Dumbfounded I asked, ""What do you mean? If it's so awesome, why would you give it away so easily?"" He explained that he had just accepted a job in Europe and was moving indefinitely in a week and needed to get rid of it. (Hence why his friends were in town to party) He told me that he was planning on just leaving it on the street, hoping that someone would find and enjoy it.

After exchanging numbers and beginning to coordinate the hand off, I started getting a fuzzy feeling, and heard cats meowing in the distance. I said something to the effect of ""Wait a second, are you guys redditors?"" Everyone of their eyes lit up and proclaimed a collective ""Yea!"" Needless to say this immediately bonded and a great time was had by all. One of the highlights of the discussion regarding reddit, was when my new found fri**ENT** told me this was his first random run-in with a redditor. He said he was feeling relieved very that not all redditors were ""basement dwellers"" haha. 

The real highlight was discussing what we thought the reddit philosophy was. Personally, I think we are smart, curious and intellectual but we can still appreciate the stupidest most asinine humor. We are passionate and sometimes opinionated yet accepting and open to those who are different from us. Everyone is willing to lend a hand and help eachother out. As ruthless as we can be sometimes, we make up for it by helping those in need, giving advice and encouragement to those who are down in the dumps and we are the most clever and hilarious people on the planet. 

We identified that this whole magical story embodied everything that we thought ""reddit is.""

Anyways, we met up, made the exchange and said goodbye, hoping to meet up for a beer or sesh when he returned to the states. I told him I was only borrowing the MFLB from him, and he could have it back anytime. I crutched back to my buddy's car who was chauffeuring my crippled a$$ all over town. I opened that shiny black box, and sure enough everything was there, in great condition. I assumed it was going to be at least a little beat up and maybe missing the brush or battery caps etc. But sure enough it was all there, and it was all mine...for free thanks to this chance encounter with a really cool guy and reddit.

I hope you enjoyed this story, because I sure did, and I'm still reaping the benefits of this chance encounter. I have honestly been preaching the gospel of reddit, trees and MFLB's ever since.

Had the MFLB for a year, originally bought it to get me off tobacco as I was a big cigarette and spliff smoker. I haven't had a cigarette for 12 months but have been smoking weed with tobacco again for the last 6 months, almost completely ignoring my MFLB.

This new year's resolution was to finally get rid of my tobacco dependence and use the MFLB as my only method of getting high. I'd heard good things about the PA but it always seemed crazy expensive and I thought that the batteries (Powerex 2700s) were fit for purpose. Man I was wrong.

I ordered the PA from the official Magic Flight site on Boxing Day with the cheapest shipping option. I was totally surprised when it arrived yesterday. Build quality is very high and after 5-10 minutes with it, so was I. I shit you not, this thing turns your MFLB into overdrive. It's hard to explain but the high seems so much more instant, the vape thicker and so much more potent. Usually, with batteries, the MFLB takes me to a [4] and keeps me there unless I force myself to do 2-3 trenches in quick succession. After 1 trench with the PA I hit at least a steady [6] and after another half trench I was drifting off toward an [8]. I've never reached those levels without burning weed in a bong or a spliff.

For anyone, like myself, who didn't think it would be worth it, IMHO it totally is. Colour me converted.  ",,False,self,t5_2rs76,False,,,True,t3_15xzio,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/15xzio/a_year_with_using_batteries_v_a_day_with_the_pa/,

So i did my shift, came home and watched tv while i vaped my first trench... and WOAAHHHHHH does this little thing take you for a ride! This has to be the best thing iv ever bought for my herbs!!

I then vaped it constantly for the weekend and continued to like it more and more..

THEN monday after work i decide to make some edibles with the avb(or abv.. what ever is right). I lurked through  the net and  decided to make firecrackers... but with people home i had to make it discreetly all i did was put all the abv i had, which was 0.9-1gs worth in a bowl with 2 tablespoons of nutella, i then mixed it thoroughly and let it sit for 10 minutes and just dipped roughly 6 regular crackers into it.

i didnt expect much to happen really, an hour and a half went past and i still felt nothing... then around the 2 hour mark i was the highest id ever been... and stayed that way for a good 5 hours until i went to sleep while i was still fucked!

bottom line.. for anyone still contemplating purchasing one.. take it from me, if you want a decent, portable cheap vape then this is defiantly one of the best options!

Before the influx of third lung posts, I remember consistently reading that smaller hits were better.  Because our lungs can only absorb a small amount of THC at a time, it was best to take small hits and ghost them.  

The third lung defies all this logic.  Seems like the purpose is to take a monster rip.  And if that is NOT the purpose (and you are just sipping from the lung), isn't the whole contraption just providing a ton of surface area for the vapor to condense on (and not make it to your lungs)?

So, how is the lung not just wasting herb?  Actually very interested in the answer, not just trolling.

EDIT:  Exhaling most of the THC and having it condense in the third lung is my wasteful idea.  If the lung is NOT really getting more high out of the herb, then its real purpose is being a time saver.  This is the lazy part.  But I was using these words to grab your attention not to be a hater.

EDIT 2: [And what does the third lung do for the science of micro-hitting (see MFLB's post and graphs halfway down the page)](http://fuckcombustion.com/threads/the-magic-flight-box.750/page-156)?

   The unique wood construction of the MFLB lends itself to the ability to retain scent from highly aromatic compounds.  For the last 2 weeks, I've been intermittently storing my box in a tin of Teavana ""Wild Orange Blossom"" Tea.  The intense aroma of the tea has given my box and trenches a wonderful natural citrus flavor. 

   Teavana tea is somewhat pricey, so expect to spend ~$10-15 for a tin w/ 2oz of tea.  I received my tea as a holiday gift (~4 to 6oz), and it seems to pretty high quality tea from what I can tell.  The tea tins are air tight, making them a great discrete place to store your box w/ or without tea.


Materials:

* Tea Tin (1): 
http://www.teavana.com/tea-products/tea-storage-tins

* Herbal Tea (2 oz minimum):
http://www.teavana.com/the-teas/herbal-teas

Procedure:

* 1) Place MFLB in tea tin.
* 2) Wait 12-24 hours.
* 3) Remove and utilize MFLB.
* 4) Return to tin as needed for flavor.

* no rolling for joints
* smellproof (no fabreeze or air vents necessary)
* super stealthy and discreet (non smokers don't know what it is)

First off, I have tried this 3 other times with unsatisfactory results. Last time I used 4 size 0 pills and felt nothing all day. 

Now for today:

It's 7 EST. I swallowed 6 Size 0 AVB pills at 5 o'clock. Just now I poured more in my protein shake. Total amount used I would say is almost a half of a standard pill bottle. I don't have anything to take weight measurements. I will take photos if necessary. 

7:06: A [1]. Starting to feel very faint effects in my head and arms. 

7:31: [2]. Tired. Feel like going to sleep. 

8:06: Solid [1]. Less light headed than before. 

8:38: [3]. I feel heavy. 

9:19: [6] Wow, funny to see interest. I'm at my frient's place, had 2 bowl hits here. Definitely feeling it. Fingers are tingling, still feeling heavier. 

9:43: [4] playing video games. Took another hit. 

10:23: [2] well that was fun. Certainly expected it to last longer. Might hit a trench tonight. For all you! Details later 

Final Edit: 10:53: [2] Feeling great now. Real relaxed. Overall, it was great ""body high"", felt the effects but still in control, nice. I would imagine that I could save this for long days without access to a vape, but I am certainly disappointed it didn't last longer, or take so much to have an effect. I will have to do research on how many hits most people do per trench (with 2700 mAh batteries). 

As far as how many grams I took, if I had to guess? I can't really tell. From what I've read about how many grams can be in one capsule (~.5), I'm still ending up in really high numbers. I may go buy a little scale to find out for sure.

Well, now you can vape kief without raiding you kief chamber. Just follow these simple instructions:

Step 1: Grind bud. If you have a 4 piece grinder, keep the grinder upside down when you grind it, so the bud doesn't fall through the holes. This will allow the teeth in the grinder to continue cutting the bud, thus making it finer. For people with 2 piece grinders, you don't need to worry. The longer you grind your bud the better.
If you don't have a grinder, there are plenty of tutorials on how to make make-shift grinders out of things like Lego.

Step 2: Put the ground bud in a small plastic container. Film canisters work great, small pill bottles would work well also make sure no bud will fall out though.

Step 3: Clean a coin off (I use rubbing alcohol; coins are *very* dirty). Then put the coin in the small container with the weed. 

Step 4: Shake. Shake it as hard and long as you can.

Step 5: Take the entire container and put it in the freezer. If you live in a non-ent friendly house, hide it in the freezer in or behind something. Wait as long as you want. The longer the better (I usually wait 30 mins or more).

Step 6: Take out container and shake again. This time shake longer, though.

You will now have a powder like consistency. It is amazing to vape. Honestly comparable to kief, in my opinion. 
To keep the powder from sticking to the screen of your box, shake it immediately after you finish taking a hit. Other wise you might have to stir it with a toothpick or you MFLB brush.

Second vaporizer for my ship, first being the Puff-It super stealthy vape shaped like an asthma inhaler. Not too impressed with the Puff-It, I debated whether or not to requisition an MFLB for daily interspacial operations.

Now that I've been implementing it for a week I wish I hadn't waited so long. Superior draw (I prefer native, my crew likes the stem), smooth, with a very satisfactory result. Also uses less herb than combustion devices. The stealth factor is also a huge plus. I used the LB in my ship-to-surface shuttle on several occasions during the week. Think the one-hitter might be a thing of the past for me.

Here at the end of the 7-day orbit cycle I've decided to add my week's collection of AVB to some caramel pretzel yogurt from Yogurt Mountain and launch myself into the stratosphere. Never consumed AVB before, I'll include my notes in next week's report.

1372257776.0,34,self.mflb,1h3yxu,I wanted to share my story of Magic-Flight being cool guys,MrAtrophy,40,6,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/1h3yxu/i_wanted_to_share_my_story_of_magicflight_being/,"So late last year, a friend of mine moved over to the US (I live in Australia), and as a parting gift he left me his MFLB. So the Box is second hand and after using it for the first time, I instantly fell in love.

Then tragedy struck. The screen came loose on one side and then pretty much came clean off the trench during my second sesh. Thousands of tears were shed, and I put the Box away in my grief.

Months later (last Friday), I hear about Magic-Flight's amazing warranty policies and hope springs within me. I checked out their site and after reading all their info I decided to give a claim a try. I was hopeful but not expecting them to do anything because it was second hand etc.

Today I got the email letting me know a replacement had been shipped! I'm overjoyed at how wonderful these guys are, and I'm so excited to become reacquainted with the power of the Box.

Thank you, Based Flight
