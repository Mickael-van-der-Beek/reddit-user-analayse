1366745395.0,44,self.jobbit,1cyey6,[Hiring] OOP experienced dev (C++/C#/Java); can work from home; corp and indie projects; small team; Android/iOS/SQL knowledge a plus,ShortFuse,52,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobbit/comments/1cyey6/hiring_oop_experienced_dev_ccjava_can_work_from/,"Okay, so this is ShortFuse, creator of SuperOneClick and [Fusion Messenger](/r/fusionIM).

**Background:**

I run a small business which is more corporate and I also have a lot of indie develop stuff (like Fusion) which is for general public. There will be annoying corp stuff that I might ask you to help me with like build an SQL query for a report. Then there's the more exciting things that like reverse engineering Skype or something. 

I currently have a lot of projects that I need help with. Fusion can use a second coder and I have secret projects that need to be cleaned up and finished to be made public.

**Pay:**

The corp stuff I'm looking at $20-$40/hr working from home. I don't like paying per hour because if you can something great in an hour, it's unfair to pay you at a lesser rate than somebody else would take longer and do a worse job. The full details would really be worked out by a mixture how much you know, how fast you do it, and how well it's done. We can probably agree of a set price for certain tasks. We can set something up like a fixed weekly rate and per incident, but again, it depends on those 3 factors listed before.

The independent stuff would probably be per project/gig split of the profit.

I just want to confirm, you will get paid. Just because there are indie projects, doesn't mean there isn't structure behind it. You won't hear ""we didn't make money, so no pay."" You will work for me on projects both corp and indie.

**Requirements:**

* *Familiarity with OOP coding.* Syntax isn't important if you come from a Java, C#, C++, Javascript background. As long as you understand objects, methods, classes, variables, etc we can build stuff. A lot of my projects will branch to different platforms.

* *Enjoy coding.* This is actually a must. I'm interesting in super-projects that change/affect people's lives. Sometimes you won't see the fruit of your labor until weeks of foundation coding. If you don't like to code, this won't be for you. You must love building incrementally to a big goal because if you're in it for just the money, you'll tire yourself out.

* *Speak, read and write English fluently.* Even though I speak fluent Spanish, English is important to read 3rd party language or protocol documentation. 

* *Willing to learn.* It's very probable you won't know everything I would like you to know and I don't expect it. Because of this, you have to be willing enough to be taught certain languages, concepts, programming styles, etc. Ideally, I would like somebody to be able to learn a new language for the sake of project if needed. (IE, if you never used JSON before but know XML, you're probably going to have learn JSON regardless)

**Perks:** (not required)

* *Live in NYC area.* Most of my corp side clients of are in the Tri-State area. Also sometimes, sit-down is better than Skype.

* *Speak, read, and/or write Spanish.* Added perk, a lot of a my clients don't speak English well or will communicate with us in Spanish.

* *SQL experience.* It's not major, but I backbone a lot of my system with SQL so if you can understand and help improve db structure, it's a plus.

* *iOS dev experience.* I have never written code for an iOS, so if I can offshoot a couple of things to you, good. Not required, I'll eventually learn it.

* *Android dev experience.* Not really that important if you have OOP experience, just speeds things along.

* *HTML/CSS experience.* I just started learning HTML/CSS/JS, but i'm not incompetent at all. Just helps me build sites faster or can designate some tasks.

* *Creative vision.* This might sound a little off-putting, but I want to build and create new, exciting things. I want to bring new elements into people's live. I want to revolutionize industries.

* *Social media marketing knowledge.* Twitter, Facebook, SEO, etc. Not too important, but can help when planning out projects.


**Objective:**

I want to surround myself with smart people with different strengths. I am a jack of all trades. I just need secondary coders (this position) to help me complete projects faster. The idea create new solutions and experiences that revolution the way they live their lives. Yes, we will make money in the process and lots of it, but creativity comes first. 

**Contact:**

If you're interested or have any questions about this, respond to me via [Reddit PM](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=ShortFuse). I'm not looking for email. Put shortly, if you're not on reddit and you're trying to apply to this job, you're not cutting edge enough. (Seriously, no reddit account?)

Not making excuses. But it's the only job I could score right now. I am pretty wiped out every day.

I have to be available 7 days a week, and can be scheduled any time from 10am-1am. 

I need employable skills. While I think I have great skills obviously the fruits of my labor show otherwise. I did not finish my college degree and left a year early to take a job at an internet start up. After 7 years it was bought out and I lost my job. I went on to be a restaurant manager (Fine Dining) for the next 5, until it closed down. 

I like to think my people skills are top notch, and my ability to sell is really great. Selling 150 dollar bottles of wine is great practice for selling anything imho. I am tech savvy, and can break down and rebuild computers as well as diagnose any problems and fix them. Virus,Malware,networking issues, etc. Although I have no certs. And I am not a programmer. I feel that I need to get a niche. Currently I am making right around 30,000 a year. Which is not nearly enough. Especially for the hours. But it does have health benefits. 

I honestly don't care what I do for a living. I just really want a job that pays closer to 55k to allow me a decent quality of life, and to be able to save for retirement. Something where I work closer to 40 hours a week, and don't kill myself every day physically. I would especially enjoy Sundays off. So I can go back to hanging with my brother and seeing my girlfriend more often. 

Any advice would be great. I'd love to get some type of certificate or dental hygiene degree. But with my hours it doesn't seem realistic. Most things I have looked in to require a 4-6 hour window that I don't have open.

- Inventory calibration (otherwise known as ""counting"")

* Specifying and building custom web applications to enhance our campaigns
* Maintaining the front end interface of PCCC websites
* Creating innovative user interfaces that advance the field of online organizing
* Ensuring integration and funtionality of third party software platforms

**Your Qualifications**

We are a senior team of 3-4 people who develop the core facilities that form the foundation of AMD's GPU hardware testing stack. We work on products that you may own or want :)

New college grads are OK. Industry experience is nice, not required.

We have a relaxed atmosphere and achievable bottom-up schedules. Management is tech-aware and BS-averse.

Hardware engineering is comprised of several disciplines: hardware architecture, pre-silicon verification, post-silicon bringup, manufacturing, production software drivers, and physical design. We have direct customers in all of these disciplines except physical design. So this job is an excellent way to see a little bit of everything in the hardware development space. We support every GPU made by AMD at every phase of the design cycle.

The ideal candidate is comfortable negotiating requirements for new features, designing APIs and implementations, debugging complex failures, managing the release of new software versions, and maintaining deployed releases through the end of their life cycle.

The ideal candidate is an aggressive learner, able to gather information from multiple sources to synthesize a working understanding of a large system. Learning and communicating are the largest parts of the job.

The ideal candidate:

 * is strong in C++, data structures, and use of the STL

 * can design large software systems

 * can understand computer architectures and memory subsystems

 * is comfortable working on a team of 3-5 senior developers, often working independently on complex problems

 * is able to distill and communicate complex subjects

 * is comfortable working in a large system, without complete knowledge of the whole

 * is comfortable defining the foundational layers of a large system

 * has time-management and project-management skills

 * has a BS/MS degree in CS, EE, or Computer Engineering

 * knows Perl or a similar scripting language

It's a plus if you have:

 * experience supporting multiple customers with diverse requirements at once

 * experience in a related area: verification, diagnostics, perhaps driver development?

 * knowledge of computer graphics, OpenGL, DirectX, or OpenCL

 * knowledge of x86 system architecture

 * experience developing linux drivers

 * experience writing portable software that runs in diverse environments

AMD is here to stay. The graphics business is healthy; the CPU business is getting healthy. We're developing competitive products to win in the marketplace again.

When they made the offer I said I would examine the overall compensation package and get back to them.  There are a couple of other issues I see, for example, they offer fewer vacation days (they claimed to offer more but when I read their benefits site it's because they roll vacation days in with sick days).

I want to point this out and basically say, look, your overall compensation package is not as good as where I'm at, you're going to have to do substantially better on the base salary, stock grants, or whatnot to make me consider moving over.

I think that's reasonable, but I don't have a lot of experience negotiating.  I do know from doing recruiting for my own company that I am already underpaid for my industry by about $30k and so at a minimum I'd expect that much more than what I'm making now.

**Who we are:**

[Go Ghost](http://go-ghost.com) is a San Diego based company with a focus on advanced software development for the computer animation industry. We create technology that dramatically improves the process of producing animated feature films, television commercials, and visual effects. Even in its prototype stage, our software has already been used in several award winning commercials. Our tech is patented, prototyped, and production-proven, but it needs to be fleshed out as an end-user application. That's where you come in.

You will be leading a team of developers who are creating an application which represent the next major evolution of the animation industry. As the lead, you will need experience in the technologies required to bring the application to market.


**Experience you should have**

* An extreme level of competence in C++ (you should know C better than your own mother!)
* GPU and CPU rendering and raytracing (CUDA / OpenCL, SSE etc)
* Image processing and compression algorithms
* Shader writing
* QT
* Python
* Experience building end-user applications

**Experience leading a team is necessary.** You'll need the chops to order your subordinate programmer slaves what to do.


**Bonus Points**

* Familiarity with CG tools, API’s, and processes (Maya, Nuke, rendering, compositing, etc)
* Familiarity with 2D and 3D file formats (OpenEXR, FBX, OBJ, etc)
* A genuine interest in film and animation
* A sense of humor

Essentially you should be a superhero of the graphics programming world. But you will be treated as such, and it comes with some pretty sweet perks:


**Perks**

* Competitive salary
* Equity
* The best health benefits you can get
* Relocation expenses taken care of
* We'll buy (or build) you a laptop and a workstation of your choosing
* Access to a huge render/compile farm
* The most ridiculously amazing work environment of all time (especially if you surf!)

I work here as a software engineer (I don't manage anyone) and think it's a great job to have and an awesome team to work on! We are looking for more talented and smart people to join our team so I'm trying to help in that effort. This isn't going to be fancy because I'm not HR or a hiring manager so, here goes:

**JOB DESCRIPTION**

I won't bore you with a list of technologies you should know or experience you should have - I'll just tell you what we do and how we do it and let you decide if you'd be a good fit or not. What's cool about working here is that we're usually pretty quick to upgrade to the latest technology so you won't have to worry about your skills rotting on old tech here.

**WHAT WE DO**

* We build both desktop AND web applications to help manage and monitor data center environments - here's what we use to do it:

* We use MS SQL Server 2008 R2 (probably be on 2012 by the end of the year if it releases on time) - we have a couple of dedicated DBA-types on our team but everyone knows their way around a database and can write SQL pretty well.

* Our software is built using Microsoft development tools &amp; platforms but it runs on all kinds of devices (iPad, Windows Phone, - and we'd like to add more mobile devices soon too like Android/iPhone)

* We have apps built in WPF, Silverlight, HTML 5/JavaScript - we also use stuff like WCF, Entity Framework, KnockoutJS, jQuery, jQuery Mobile, JSON, Windows Forms, etc. We're definitely not afraid to learn about new tools &amp; libraries and integrate them into our stack.

* We code in C#, JavaScript and are looking at Script# to help us out with our large JS codebase.

* We use OnTime 2011 (from Axosoft) to manage our releases and the defects/features they include.

* We use Subversion for source control.

* At least a few of us are redditors! (that I know of - maybe a couple others are lurkers that I don't know about). We even made a new Scumbag Steve meme image out of something a co-worker did a couple of weeks ago. Yeah...we know how to really get down and party here.

* Keep in mind that we don't expect someone applying to be an expert (or even really knowledgeable) about all the technologies I mentioned above. I only knew about half the stuff I currently use now when I started - they let me take a little time to ramp up and educate myself on a few things when I started. You should have a solid background in being able to solve problems and software development patterns/methodologies though. Learning certain libraries or tools once you're here is no biggie.

**PERKS**

* The office is based in Scottsdale, AZ but working remotely will be considered. I actually work from home 2 days a week myself since I don't live that near to the office. Easy VPN connection and connect over remote desktop. :)

* Weekly Team Lunches (free food!)

* Membership to Lifetime Fitness (gym nearby the office)

* Frequent team building activities - race karts, rock climbing, hiking, etc

* Xbox and Wii hooked up to flat screens (when you want to blow off some steam or just kill some time).

* You'll get to learn the latest technologies and use great equipment &amp; software to do your job. I have 2 big flat screen monitors and a fast machine to work on.

* Oh yeah, almost forgot - Medical/Dental/Vision benefits are great too - plus a good retirement savings (401k) match %

If you're interested, send your resume to careers@io.com and tell them you're interested in software development. Tell them you saw this reddit post too and I might get some kind of referral bonus!

For the sake of privacy, I won't post my entire resume here, as I am slightly paranoid someone from my current job will somehow find it.

I am a young professional with ~2 years of administrative/front-desk experience, as well as a little over 1 year of data analysis experience.

I am fluent in German, English and Russian (written as well as oral) and am able to utilize basic SQL, intermediate HTML and I like to think of myself as an Excel Wiz!

I currently reside in the US (Rhode Island), and am a legal, permanent resident with no need for sponsorship. My current position is for a mid-sized, privately own e-commerce company located in the New England area.

At the moment I have a 3 hour commute to work which is eating me up; It's the sole reason why  started looking around for a new opportunity. I know, I should consider myself lucky to have a steady job but anyone who has ever been in my position probably knows how nerve-wrecking it can be.

If you have any leads or tips for me, I would highly appreciate it. I am more than willing to email you my resume, too. I know this subreddit seems to focus more on engineering jobs and such, but I thought I'll give it a shot... one never knows what may happen.

Sincerely,

We are a tech company which is growing rapidly, and we want the right people! We currently have a number of open Software Developer positions at all levels, from entry to senior.  I'm also looking for a release/build engineer/manager.

If any of this interests you in any way, please email me at hrsd@onssi.com

**About the company:**

OnSSI (www.onssi.com) is a technology company focusing on the video surveillance software market. We are the #1 ranked video management software company in North America by market share, 3 years running. 

We are located in Pearl River N.Y. and pay competitively, provide 100% health coverage (with great rates on dental and vision), and 20 days of paid time off.
 
**Our products (what you will be working on):**

Ocularis is a video surveillance software used by organizations large and small.  We have clients in virtually every industry and of every scale. From large distributed systems to single camera installs, our software can do it all.

With the release of our new Ocularis-X product, we’ve begun working with streaming live high resolution video over limited bandwidth connections.

**Environment:**

In the R&amp;D group, we are always looking for great talent. Our team loves what they do and loves working together. Collectively, we are working to make OnSSI a world class software company. 

The R&amp;D group has their own private space away from the hustle and bustle of sales and technical support. Developers typically arrive around 9 am and leave around 5.  I say “around” because each person is different; some like to come in closer to 8 and some closer to 10. 

The dress code is casual, but not to the point of shorts or flip flops. Most people wear jeans and a golf shirt or company Ts.  Each developer gets a brand new i7 with SSD, 8 gigs of ram and dual 23” widescreens.

Every developer gets to work on new stuff, no matter what level they are.  For instance, we just developed a new product which combined JQuery, directx, and flash. Coming up we have some new features which will be adding to our WCF services and WPF controls.

We have just performed a major overhaul of our process. The developers come first. They have the last say on how long a task might take. There is no trying to squeeze a 5 day task into 2 days. On average our daily standup lasts 9 minutes. We are also in the process of increasing our iteration frequency to better serve our customers.

Every developer is empowered to take control. Each one of them can come to the rest of the group and teach us all something new. We’ve begun the foray into inversion of control, and are open to any and all great technologies and processes. If a developer has an idea for a feature, they can write a story card and add it to the backlog for prioritization; and developers have at least 20% of every sprint to prioritize what they want.

We score an 11 out of 12 on the Joel Test (no hall way usability yet).

**Position Responsibilities:**

The Software developer will collaborate with other developers, product managers, and testers to add new features, or develop new products. You will need to be able to effectively break down a problem into easy to solve tasks, for you or others to complete. 

A developer does more than just code, you need to be able to take ownership of the software and think about the future direction, feature wise as well as architecturally. We are all in it together to make our software easier to use, with more functionality. 

If you find issues with the code, you should feel the strong desire to fix them, be it a refactoring or adding a unit test. At times, you may be asked to research a new technique or technology which may be useful. If you bring these things up proactively, all the better. 

Once a year, a developer may make a trip out to a customer’s facility to get a firsthand view of how they use it.  This may mean some travel. 

**Requirements Include:**

* Clear communicator (written and verbal) -- to ensure ability to work with other developers and stakeholders.
* Creative solving of technical problems -- to ensure the resolution of bugs and addition of new features.
* Ability to think critically -- to ensure ability to come to the best solution for an issue.
* 0+ years of C# or C++ experience. (so this means you need to have been exposed to them, but no professional experience needed)
* Knowledge of design patters.
* Degree in CS or equivalent experience

Bonuses:

* WPF experience
* WCF experience
* Unit Testing experience
* Agile process experience
* Team leadership experience

**Note:**
A big thank you to everyone in this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/tdfnt/what_do_you_look_for_in_an_employer/) who helped refine this.  I welcome all comments and suggestions on how to make this posting more appealing.

**Edit**
I appreciate some of the resumes I've received, but I do want to clarify.  I put 0+ years experience to denote professional experience.  I still need you to know how to use the languages, IDEs, and know design patterns.  I cant take folks who like computers but have zero programming experience.

#Job description#

PharmGKB is seeking a java web developer to work on a web frontend for software and data created by the research group. The group has developed a natural language processing (NLP) research tool for information extraction from scientific literature. The developer will be primarily working on developing the frontend UI for interacting with the extracted data set, and will be integrating the frontend into our curators' workflow and into the current PharmGKB codebase, to give it practical usage.  The developer will also be working closely with researchers, curators, and and other developers to build a tool that enhances the features and general usefulness of the current text annotation pipeline.

The project involves annotating all research journal articles indexed by Medline (over 100 million sentences in 20 million scientific publications), extracting relationships between entities of interest at the sentence level via algorithms developed in the research lab, and ultimately integrating the results of this text mining project into our curators' workflow. The developer will be building a front end to interact with the large amount of data emerging from this system.

This is a contract position for at least 30 hours/week that will end by September, 2011,with the possibility of extension to September, 2012. The developer is expected to work on-site in Palo Alto, California.


#About Us# 
PharmGKB (http://www.pharmgkb.org) is a publicly available Internet research tool developed by Stanford University with funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Its aim is to aid researchers and clinicians in understanding how genetic variation among individuals contributes to differences in reactions to drugs. The Altman lab is a research lab led by Russ B. Altman, with a research focus on text mining of pharmacogenomic information (genetically-influenced drug-response).


#How to Apply#

Basically, our (Mac/iOS) app has a concept of a ""database"" that holds from a few to a few million documents (RTF, PDF, JPEG, whatever) and some assorted metadata for each.  These databases often get up into the tens of gigabytes in size and should be synchronized more-or-less continuously -- think Dropbox's client, which mostly just keeps its mouth shut and syncs in the background.  In addition, the app will generally host multiple databases at any given time.  We're not looking for anything fancy; we just want a nice, reliable, scalable backend for storing the files and the metadata.  

We have a synchronization solution in place that uses other people's servers (Dropbox, WebDAV, etc).  We want to move forward with our own service.

You'll be working with me (joy!) to design and implement everything server-side.  I've implemented the Dropbox, WebDAV, app-facing, and direct connection support for synchronization, but I have no meaningful experience with CouchDB or other server-side technologies, so that's where you come in.

The basic idea is that I want to use TouchDB (iOS/Mac CouchDB-based library) and make this as simple and fool-proof as possible.  I want to do what is smart, what is right, and what is scalable.

Since I'm going to be working with whomever gets selected, I wanted to see if I could help out a competent Redditor looking for a nice short-term contract.  This shouldn't be very difficult for someone with experience and competence.  My company is small, we all work from home over the internet, and we're generally laid back.  In other words, don't expect a lot of micromanagement, because frankly none of us have the time.  We just expect you to do a good job.  We'll support you however it's needed.

Hopefully, I've made clear that I don't know what I'm doing and I have no idea how long this would take.  I am a nice guy and a quasi-competent developer, though, so please don't bullshit me or my company.  I can't guarantee that someone in this thread will be hired, but if you have a good résumé and references, I'd like to make the case to my boss for a fellow Redditor.

We are looking for top developers to help us make our app all it can be.
We're bringing our previously out-sourced mobile development in-house so we need someone who knows, for example, how to handle differences in versions of the platform and the devices it may be running on and so forth.


Specifically, right now we are seeking developers with experience in native mobile development - iOS *and* Android would be preferable, just iOS acceptable, but it's important that you know what you're doing as we're a young company but growing quickly and moving fast all the time so we need someone who can hit the ground running.


An Android version is planned once our iOS app has been brought in-house and is up and running. So if you're skills are mainly Android based we would still like to hear from you.



**Essential attributes:**

* Native iOS development skills and experience - to an extent a little experience can be substituted for just being some kind of latent super-genius, so if you're that, get in touch too...
* Understanding that development priorities can change quickly in line with business reasons
* Ability to time manage and deliver on time
* Willingness to be involved in an exciting, fast growth start-up where things can move and change quickly and sometimes, just sometimes, a quick fix is good enough for now
* Willingness to suggest solutions to problems
* Able to join us in our Newcastle upon Tyne city centre office
* Sense of humour, or at least a resilience to relentless sarcasm
* We've said native a few times but just to be clear, even if you're a crack-shot with PhoneGap, Titanium, Trigger.io etc, but Objective-C is a completely mystery, that's not quite what we're after


**Desirable but not a 'must':**

* Android development experience, again with some knowledge of SDK version differences and the breadth of devices available, and the differences in working across them - we have an Android version in the works and it would be great if you can diversify - failing that, a generally skilled dev who is already iOS-experienced who has a willingness to learn this other platform until we have others dedicated to that role would be very useful
* A decent aesthetic sense - you don't need to be a designer, but an eye for detail and the ability to say ""that doesn't look right"" goes a long way
* Experience with Testflight for deploying development versions of apps
* Experience with apps to the various distribution channels


**Salary**

Negotiable based on experience but it shouldn't disappoint.


This is a permanent, full-time role but if you are looking to work part-time and you think you can convince us to consider you, please apply.




**Next Steps**

In the first instance please send a CV and a covering letter to william@spontly.com

Hello r/jobbit. I'm graduating college in late May, and I'm looking for a job after graduating. I'm looking for a job in Canada, ideally in Ontario, but honestly I'd be happy with anything in the country.

Quick overview of my experience: I've spent two years working as support for both staff and students at my university. This current year is being spent as a supervisor of that helpdesk. I've done both phone support as well as face to face and onsite support, and I would say that my support and customer service skills are both pretty excellent. To validate this, I intend to take the A+ certification exam in mid-March, and don't anticipate any problems with passing it.

Here's my one major issue - I'm a US citizen, and I will need to apply for a work visa/work permit. This should not preclude you from hiring me, however! I've already filled out all of the forms I need to, and as soon as I have a written job offer I can submit them to the Canadian government (average processing time as of this post: 49 days).

If you're interested in hiring me, I will be available starting in early June (have to graduate college before I move!).

Prefer telecommute.",CptCodeMonkey,4,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobbit/comments/17y3gs/for_hire_senior_python_engineer_with_exp_in_big/,"Short overview
==========
==========

Worked as an consultant/freelancer for the last several years but ideally would like long-term employment so I can invest myself more into projects then a ""get it done as quickly and as stable as possible.""  As as side effect of being a freelancer is that client's have little or no other sysadmin support so I've stepped into build up a working web stack and generally enjoy that work.

Basic stats:
=======

 * 10+ years working experience with PHP5
 * 10+ years working with JS intensive environments ( ExtJS, Sencha2, phonegap )
 * 10+ years of intermittent work with Java ( I know the syntax fairly well but never invested much time in the common libraries )
 * Initial background in c/c++, I now mostly use that to read source code then do actual work in those languages.
 * ~5+ years experience with Rails/Ruby +
 * 1 year iOS development experience 
 * Cursory experience with Android dev.

Python specific experience
=================

 * Mid-level to senior authority with Django 1.4 ( hosted via uWSGI though nginx )
 * Twisted web and understanding of the Zope component system.
 * Used Fabric, Boto, and paramiko for automation


Some fun past projects
===============

 * Built a semi-massive pre-big data ETL system to harvest Real estate data from dozens of MLS's across the country using pyRETS
 * Built out a small 3TB, reference model Hadoop cluster on EC2 with HBase ( which sparked my initial interest in Devops )
 * Built a prototype mass MMS platform where client's would see a specific asset code, SMS a shortcode and get back real estate property info including images &amp; video.
 * Worked on a platform that handles 6 billion HTTP trx's a month ( potentially 10x more traffic then reddit handles ).


\+ I don't really enjoy working with Rails as I've witnessed repeatedly after the initial build out is done, rail's apps seem to become increasingly fragile alongside it becoming a terrible game of wack-a-mole with gem conflicts ( especially using Bundle )

As for why I am looking for new employment, worked for a consultancy where I asked for X in compensation, they countered with X\*.9 and after 10 months I reviewed my finances to find I had made (x\*.9)/2 in actual compensation.  Primary reasons were over-estimation of work by PM's ( eg 4 hour task actually takes 15 minutes ) and lack of meritable tasks ( Slicing PSD's isn't exactly challenging or meaningful work ).",For Hire,False,,t5_2qzdl,False,fh-forhire,,True,t3_17y3gs,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobbit/comments/17y3gs/for_hire_senior_python_engineer_with_exp_in_big/,

The terms:

* I design 3 initial different concepts for you after you tell me what you want.

* Then you review them, tell me what you like/don't like and you choose 1 of them to develop it further (or if you don't like any of them, I can design a new batch for $50 extra)

* You get **unlimited** revisions for free (that means I will work until you are 100% satisfied with the result, even if it takes a month)

* I work in Illustrator (vector) so your logo will be completely scaleable and printable. Also you get .AI / .EPS and .PNG and .JPG and .PSD (layered) of the final logo

* Payment methods: PayPal, via Freelancer, Moneybookers (Skrill), or if you want to ask about something else - drop me a PM

The price range starts from 200$ for typical logo design work, but this is just so you know what to expect. For actual price for your project contact me with information. 

I know that some of you are on a low budget and you are used to seeing designers work for $30 on some forums, but this is totally different. I am talking about the real process of designing a brand image, something your company can proudly stand behind. Also please be aware that communication is key, the more you succeed in telling me what you want the better.

If you're wondering about a time frame the designs are usually completed in under a week, but of course that depends from a lot of things.

This business is only about 8 months old and I've already sold about 15,000 of them. Taking care of administrative stuff takes up most of my time and doesn't leave much to actually put them together. Plus, I have a bit of social anxiety when it comes to trying to sell stuff — those 15,000 sold pretty much without any effort from me.

So I'm looking for people to do the sales work and/or assembly for me.

The options I can think of:

1. Drop-shipping. Good if you know how to do e-commerce. Just list Noteboards for sale on your site. Sell them for however much you want — I usually do $10. When someone orders one from you, PayPal me $5 for that order and I'll ship it for you the same or next day without charging you anything additional. So you're making $5 for doing basically no work. I know next-to-nothing about web development and coding so out-competing me shouldn't be hard at all.

2. Referrals. If you know a store or something that might want to buy Noteboards, let me know. I'll gladly pay you up to 90% of the profits depending on how much work you put into making the order happen.

3. Assemble Noteboards for me. It's **really really really easy**; you don't need anything but a floor or table. I'll ship you the Noteboards themselves, plus the pouches in which I package them and the dry-erase markers I include. I'm a not-very-well-off 23-year-old so I can't send this stuff out for free, but I can do it for $2.50 apiece which covers my expenses for materials and shipping. I'll even show you how to make a sweet and simple origami display container for Noteboards. Sell them however you want for however much you want to whoever you want.

I don't want to hire people because I like being a sole proprietor and not having to pay payroll taxes and all that stuff. Seriously, I'm open to just about anything and would only be all too happy to pay for help. Feel free to ask any questions.

You'll be joining a diverse team doing cutting-edge research in graphics, AI, mechanical engineering, and bio-engineering.  We're collaborating with physicians from some of the best medical schools in the world and working hard to make the world a better place by revolutionizing surgical training and solving the most important problems in VR and simulation.  

This is a fantastic opportunity for an aspiring developer who wants to get into graphics or game development, or a excellent chance for a veteran game developer to use their skills to directly benefit the world.

Though we're in academia, the salary is competitive with game industry rates, and will be commensurate with experience.


Responsibilities:

* Maintain and improve our custom game engine to deliver realistic and real-time visuals.
* Design and write custom GLSL shaders to achieve realistic effects such as subsurface scattering, fluids and shadows. 
* Assist researchers to bring their research code into the simulator.
* Participate in code reviews and maintenance of the code base.
* Design and develop custom user interfaces.  (Possibly some light iOS or Android development.)
* Profile and optimize the engine, including other developers' code, to get amazing performance.
* Maintain useful documentation and assist new team members with contributing to the code base.


Location:

The position is in Troy, NY. Remote development might be possible for the ideal candidate, but regular travel to Troy, NY and occasional travel to Boston would be necessary.  Note that both Boston and NYC are &lt;3 hrs drive away.


Requirements:

* Commitment to producing high-quality code using professional practices, including source-code control and unit testing.

* Excellent C++ skill (or excellence in other languages with an interest in becoming an excellent C++ programmer).

* Detail orientation.  This is a research group, but we're building serious games that are used and judged by practicing physicians-- stability and realism are paramount. 

* A strong interest in computer graphics and/or game development.

* An unmistakable passion for solving hard problems in creative and insightful ways.  A strong interest in learning about and playing with the very latest technologies in graphics, games and VR.

* Comfort with ill-defined or unusual problems.

To apply, send me a PM with:

* A link to a sample of your code that you're proud of.  This can be anything-- perhaps an open-source repository for a C++/OpenGL  game that you've completed (perfect), maybe a weird little side-project you did for fun (cool), or a school project you're especially happy with (fine).

* A brief and *honest* self-appraisal of your skill in/knowledge of:  C++, Computer Graphics, Software Development.

Furthermore the site going to contain a user system including comments, news entries and moderation of the site. One of the subpages contains an application, for which we'll need a database (MySQL is highly prefered).
The website design itself is in place, so what we're looking for is merely a programmer.

The site will include the following:

* A login bar in the top section of the website (Remains the same when changing subpages)

* Site map in the bottom section of the website (Also remains the same when changing subpages)

* Home  (subpage)
- Front page, includes a news/guides/streams banner (entries which admins and moderators may add/edit), a news section, a guides section and ""recent matches"" section.

* Team (subpage)
- This page shows the different teams belonging to Essentia Gaming (also customizable by the staff)

* Streams (subpage)
- Includes 2 pages - viewers choose a stream from a list and are redirected to a page, which shows the selected stream plus a list of the other available streams. You don't have to create the streams themselves - they are embedded from www.own3d.tv and www.twitch.tv. We'll look into the exact syntax of stream embedding as soon as possible.
- Additionally, streams need only show if they are online at the current time and they are categorized; ""Featured Streams"" and ""Other Streams"". Streams can be added by the average user, but an admin, moderator (or few selected users) have to approve the stream.

* Guides (subpage)
- Includes 3 pages; ""New Guides"", ""Featured Guides"" and ""Approved Guides"". As with streams the average user may create a guide (using a database system, including several images and text, which we will fill out ourselves), which is then approved or disapproved by the staff (or a few selected users). If a guide is exceptionally good/unique the guide can be featured by the staff.

* Matches (subpage)
- Shows the different matches the teams of Essentia Gaming have competed in. Once again the staff or a few selected users may create entries.

* Forum
- A template forum as a subpage is sufficient. For example https://www.phpbb.com. A customized forum (which fits the site design) is a bonus though.

Overall the admin needs to be able to give users certain privileges, such as promoting certain users to moderators or even giving normal users a few rights such as being able to create news entries, approve guides or approve streams. These rights may be given individually.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us at contact@essentiagaming.com.

Please note the strong tasks and capability requirements below: Store, Structure, Inter-Operability, Integration with DNS, Extensibility, Group Policy, Scalability, Replication, and Security. 

Responsible for initial design and development of new software or extensive software revisions; products may be for use internally or for resale. Defines product requirements and creates high-level architectural specifications, ensuring feasibility, functionality, and integration with existing systems/platforms. 

Requires a bachelor’s degree and may be expected to have an advanced degree in area of specialty and at least 7 years of experience in the field or in a related area. Demonstrates expertise in a variety of the field’s concepts, practices, and procedures. Relies on extensive experience and judgment to plan and accomplish goals. Performs a variety of complicated tasks. May provide consultation on complex projects and is considered to be the top level contributor/specialist. May guide a team of developers through the project to completion. Typically reports to a head of a unit/department or top management. 

Active Directory Architect - Requirements: 

At a very high Level, The Active Directory Architect is a Senior Active Directory Services Engineer, who has, but is not limited to, a strong knowledge of the following technologies needed in order to meet the goals of a growing enterprise. 

As Tasks could include anything from acquisitions and consolidations, Managing and Remediating Security Threats to the Directory Services, Integrating other “Directory’s” or applications, and tasks continuing down to designing and deploying tools and aids for other Administrators to use to manage the environment. 

To accomplish this effectively, the Architect will need a strong grasp of the following concepts and technologies. 

Store. Active Directory, hierarchically stores information about network objects in Directory Partitions, and makes this information available to administrators, users, and applications. 

Structure. Using Active Directory, the network and its objects are organized by constructs such as domains, trees, forests, trust relationships, organizational units (OUs), and sites. 

Inter-Operability. Because Active Directory is based on standard directory access protocols, it can interoperate with other directory services and can be accessed by third-party applications that follow these protocols. 

Integration with DNS. Active Directory uses the Domain Name System. DNS is an Internet standard service that translates Host names to IP addresses. 

Extensibility. Active Directory is extensible, which means that the AD Architect can add new classes of objects to the schema and can add new attributes to existing classes of objects. The schema contains a definition of each object class, and each object class's attributes, that can be stored in the directory. 

Group Policy. Group Policies are configuration settings applied to computers or users as they are initialized. All Group Policy settings are contained in Group Policy Objects (GPOs) applied to Active Directory sites, domains, or organizational units. GPO settings determine access to directory objects and domain resources, what domain resources (such as applications) are available to users, and how these domain resources are configured for use. 

Scalability. Active Directory includes one or more domains, each with one or more domain controllers, enabling you to scale the directory to meet any network requirements. Multiple domains can be combined into a domain tree and multiple domain trees can be combined into a forest. In the simplest structure, a single-domain network is simultaneously a single tree and a single forest. 

Replication. Active Directory uses multi-master replication, which lets you update the directory at any domain controller. Deploying multiple domain controllers in one domain provides fault tolerance and load balancing if properly architected 

Security. Active Directory centralizes authentication. Access control can be defined not only on each object in the directory, but also on each property of each object. In addition, Active Directory provides both the store and the scope of application for security policies. 

Interoperability. Because Active Directory is based on standard directory access protocols, such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, it can interoperate with other directory services employing these protocols. Several application programming interfaces, such as Active Directory Service Interfaces, give developers access to these protocols.

Read more!,MrCareerOpportunity,4,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobbit/comments/1grvrg/hiring_would_you_like_to_move_overseas_and_sell/,"Dear Car Sales Professionals how would you like a life changing opportunity? 

1.	Are you willing to move overseas and live in a different country?

2.	Does that get you excited? Are you reading this and thinking “YES!”?

3.	Do you want to work for a company that takes the stress out of selling? 

OMSC operates the Military Car Sales Program on US Military bases all over the world. OMSC sells American vehicles to service members and DOD civilians for overseas delivery or stateside delivery. We have positions in (Japan/Korea/Okinawa/Guam) Our commission agreement is not only better, the selling process is less stressful, more rewarding.  We need talented people! Do you want to be a part of a team that moves 12,000+ vehicles a year? 

Our sales process IS VERY DIFFERENT. There is no negotiating between you and your customer. The sales manager doesn’t approve the price. You are provided with computer/software/PDFs that tell you what the price is. You give every discount/rebate that’s available holding back does not benefit you. Why? Because you are flat rate volume based commission plan. Not only that you are responsible for selling finance, and extended warranty you are also paid for that. Yes that’s right you make money on both ends of the deal!

Bonuses are multiple and plenty. We have quarterly, yearly, unit bonuses,  aftermarket bonuses, customer satisfaction bonuses, we have so many bonuses its insane.

How much can you make? To make 6 figures in your 2nd year is not unheard of.

One of my personal favorite parts of this job is every year we have a company meeting. We fly our sales people, and managers to some country in Asia we get together and celebrate our success and get ready for pumped up for next year. How awesome would that be?

Plus living in a foreign country is amazing, sure you can hop on a plane and go visit Tokyo or Seoul however with us you CAN LIVE THERE. Experience the culture, the food, and learn all the little known gems that are to be found.

I used to be head of IT for a company that supported nuclear gamma cameras for cardiologists and other medical imaging clinics all over the country and that was about 30% to 50% travel time. Most of that travel was onsite support on imaging computers and small networks. I also worked in hospitals from time to time. I miss the traveling a lot and would probably still be at that job if they'd made me 70% to 80% travel time. But there was too much time sitting isolated in the IT room by myself to keep me happy. I'm kind of a people person.

I have a good job here as a small business IT consultant, but really miss the travel and want to do that again. I'm also really clear that I want to help and teach people, not sit in a cubical and write code and reboot servers. I've done that and while solving problems is what drew me to IT, helping people, face to face is what's kept me here.

I can't relocate because my ex-wife is here with my three year old son and he's the most important thing in my world. I'd want to be back in Colorado at least on weekends in order to spend time with him. But I'd be happy to work with a company based pretty much anywhere as long as they didn't mind me traveling from here.

**About the company:**

VideoCare, Inc. is a startup based in Menlo Park, California. We began with a simple question: ""How can we take better care of an aging parent when they live thousands of miles away?"" From that question our company was born. So many of us rely on computers and smartphones to enhance our social life, but the reality is that many of the elderly are simply shut out of the technology world. We wanted to build something that would take all of the complexity out of computing and shift the technical burden away from the care recipient. The management of the system is handled remotely by the family. This lets the care recipient enjoy video calls, shared photo albums, online videos, and streaming music -- all without having to know anything about computers.

I need 2 customization created :

1)What I am looking for is a grid view, which would have a list of clients down the left, and the invoicing cycle of days (e.g. two weeks) across the top.

That way I can very easily link a client to a day and chose the service they received. Once i fill this 'matrix' out it would generate all my invoices and send them out to each client.

The list of active clients should be editable against a table of all my clients, and the invoicing length should be adjustable.

I should also be able to flag any client such that when generating and sending a flagged clients invoice will popup and allow me to modify it as required.

2)I would like to purchase NFC tags, and program one for each dog, then attach it to their collars. On pickup I want my walkers to scan the tag with their android phone, this should pop up a quick menu in an app which says the dogs info and lets the walker very simply select the service the dog is receiving that day. Simple clean efficient. This selection would then automatically pop up in the matrix I described above, automating the invoicing process. If for some reason the phone is out of service or fails to send to the server it should cache these scans and selections locally and notify the walker they need to resend them.

If you have the skills to do both of these jobs, then you are perfect! If you are good at only one of these things, you should apply anyways, because you might still be a fit. 

For a project manager, we would like someone who can communicate effectively with clients and keep them happy. You should be organized, and good at keeping others on track. You should have a good idea of all the things that need to happen for a web development project to be successful and know the right buttons to push at the right time.  Ideally, you should be able to architect a project from scratch yourself, but we have people who can do that already, so more than anything we just need someone who knows the basics and can communicate and keep all stakeholders happy and on the right track. This person would have to be fluent in English and reside in North America. 

Specific duties would include things such as: 
- requirements gathering with clients, and project outlining/estimating/scheduling. 
- making sure any bottlenecks in the process are handled, and the right people get the right assets/information/questions
- managing task trackers and help desk systems. 
- the occasional reporting


For a themer, we obviously need someone who knows the Drupal theming system well. You should know how to find the right template to edit without issues and can write the PHP and html necessary to make a beautiful, functional website. You should be quick at styling CSS and slicing PSD’s. We would prefer that you can work with Views, and other important Drupal modules. Experience using GIT or writing Javascript is a plus, and so is being able to write modules, or being an expert at any other language or technologies - the more well rounded the better, so let us know what you are good at. 

Who are we? Incendia Media is a technology management company, and we provide the technology behind some of the most trafficked sites on the internet. We do site development, we run servers, we find solutions to whatever problems our clients are looking to solve. We’re a completely distributed team, with members all over North America so you can happily work in your underwear and we don’t care. We’re flexible about when you work and how much you work, and we don’t believe in tight deadlines or having our employees kill themselves to make us happy. If you have to do that, someone is not doing their job properly. We also don’t keep it too serious. We believe in compensating employees as best we can, but we are a startup with a limited budget, so we won’t be paying $50+/hr at this point sadly, so if that’s what you are looking for, you are wasting your time.  

How to apply:
Message me with your cover letter and resume. I don’t really care too much about hearing about your years of experience or what skills/qualities you have - I would prefer to hear concrete examples of what you have worked on, or things you have done, that show the skills/qualities we are looking for. Thanks for your time!

We are a tech company which is growing rapidly, and we want the right people! We currently have a number of open Software Developer positions at all levels, from entry to senior.  I'm also looking for a release/build engineer/manager.

If any of this interests you in any way, please email me at hrsd@onssi.com

**About the company:**

OnSSI (www.onssi.com) is a technology company focusing on the video surveillance software market. We are the #1 ranked video management software company in North America by market share, 3 years running. 

We are located in Pearl River N.Y. and pay competitively, provide 100% health coverage (with great rates on dental and vision), 12 days of paid vacation, plus additional personal, sick, and flex time.
 
**Our products (what you will be working on):**

Ocularis is a video surveillance software used by organizations large and small.  We have clients in virtually every industry and of every scale. From large distributed systems to single camera installs, our software can do it all.

With the release of our new Ocularis-X product, we’ve begun working with streaming live high resolution video over limited bandwidth connections.

**Environment:**

In the R&amp;D group, we are always looking for great talent. Our team loves what they do and loves working together. Collectively, we are working to make OnSSI a world class software company. 

The R&amp;D group has their own private space away from the hustle and bustle of sales and technical support. Developers typically arrive around 9 am and leave around 5.  I say “around” because each person is different; some like to come in closer to 8 and some closer to 10. 

The dress code is casual, but not to the point of shorts or flip flops. Most people wear jeans and a golf shirt or company Ts.  Each developer gets a brand new i7 with SSD, 8 gigs of ram and dual 23” widescreens.

Every developer gets to work on new stuff, no matter what level they are.  For instance, we just developed a new product which combined JQuery, directx, and flash. Coming up we have some new features which will be adding to our WCF services and WPF controls.

We have just performed a major overhaul of our process. The developers come first. They have the last say on how long a task might take. There is no trying to squeeze a 5 day task into 2 days. On average our daily standup lasts 9 minutes. We are also in the process of increasing our iteration frequency to better serve our customers.

Every developer is empowered to take control. Each one of them can come to the rest of the group and teach us all something new. We’ve begun the foray into inversion of control, and are open to any and all great technologies and processes. If a developer has an idea for a feature, they can write a story card and add it to the backlog for prioritization; and developers have at least 20% of every sprint to prioritize what they want.

We are on our way to conforming to all 12 tenants of the Joel test.

**Position Responsibilities:**

The Software developer will collaborate with other developers, product managers, and testers to add new features, or develop new products. You will need to be able to effectively break down a problem into easy to solve tasks, for you or others to complete. 

A developer does more than just code, you need to be able to take ownership of the software and think about the future direction, feature wise as well as architecturally. We are all in it together to make our software easier to use, with more functionality. 

If you find issues with the code, you should feel the strong desire to fix them, be it a refactoring or adding a unit test. At times, you may be asked to research a new technique or technology which may be useful. If you bring these things up proactively, all the better. 

Once a year, a developer may make a trip out to a customer’s facility to get a firsthand view of how they use it.  This may mean some travel. 

**Requirements Include:**

* Clear communicator (written and verbal) -- to ensure ability to work with other developers and stakeholders.
* Creative solving of technical problems -- to ensure the resolution of bugs and addition of new features.
* Ability to think critically -- to ensure ability to come to the best solution for an issue.
* 0+ years of C# or C++ experience. (so this means you need to have been exposed to them, but no professional experience needed)
* Knowledge of design patters.
* Degree in CS or equivalent experience

Bonuses:

* WPF experience
* WCF experience
* Unit Testing experience
* Agile process experience
* Team leadership experience

Can be male or female but must meet these requirements:


Be between the ages of 14-24 yrs old

Authentic accents, no actors or imitations please!

Must speak English fluently.

Since you probably cannot come to our studio, you must have a way to record your voice with a decent microphone in a decent (not noisy) recording environment. It doesn't have to be professional quality but it shouldn't be with a cheap noisy mic or in a bad location that makes the recording too distorted or noisy to use in a commercial.


Possible accents:

* British

* German

* Chinese

* Japanese

* Thai

* Vietnamese

* Australian

* Swedish

* Danish

* Norwegian


But really any accent except Spanish, Russian, or African accents (we have those already) will be considered.


If you meet the requirements please send an email with a recording of you reading a paragraph in english from a magazine or a book. Remember we are looking for people to read in English with a foreign accent, not for people to read in their native language. It can be anything we just need to hear your accent and your voice. It does not need to be longer than a short paragraph or two. It can be any type of audio file, although we prefer a high quality mp3.


Please don't try to be funny and send in something pornographic as you will be automatically rejected! We need to play your recording to our client.


Please reply to this post, pm me, or better yet go ahead and send an email with your recording attached to gguardia (at) mindspring (dot) com.


The casting will be held on the morning of friday May 28 from 10-12pm EST. We need to have your file by then in order to be considered. If you meet the requirements, are in Miami FL and can make it to our studio in Miami even better! Let me know and I will give you directions.


Compensation for those selected is $200.00 US.

Introduction

The News Literacy Project (NLP) is a national non-profit organization that partners with middle and high school teachers and seasoned journalists to help young people become more critical, discerning consumers of news and information in the digital age.

NLP, which is based in Bethesda, MD, has recently developed a blended e-learning unit made up of video and computer-based trainings narrated by our journalist volunteers.

Overview

NLP is currently developing four videos to add to its Washington, DC, area unit and is seeking proposals for the videography and editing of these assets. The delivered product for three of these videos will be a three-to-five minute sequence of a journalist volunteer reading a script. The fourth deliverable will be a series of six short (three-to-six minute) segments shot at a single location with a single presenter. In all, this project will involve four separate shoots at four different locations throughout the DC region.

Details and Timeline

NLP’s DC-based staff will coordinate shoot times, dates and locations with the presenters and contractor. An NLP staffer will also attend each shoot to assist with the script and provide real-time feedback to the presenters.

Contractor candidates must furnish their own equipment including an HD-quality camera with a manual focus, a high-quality wireless lavalier or shotgun mic to minimize ambient noise, and whatever lighting equipment is needed to compensate for potentially harsh or insufficient indoor lighting (at least some kind of gentle fill). Access to a portable teleprompter would be ideal.

The contractor will shoot and edit footage of each presentation and deliver an initial draft of each sequence for feedback and approval. The final deliverables will include the produced videos rendered as a 720p H264, the raw footage as well as any project files from the editing process (preferably in Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere).
NLP encourages candidates to propose a timeline that reflects their earliest possible delivery date; all final videos must be delivered no later than October 1. We encourage candidates to deliver each of the videos separately, as they are completed. NLP can begin scheduling shoots as early as the week of August 5.

Proposals do not need to follow a particular format, but should include the following:
 * Linked or attached relevant credentials, including portfolio/reel
 * Rate and estimated total cost based on the details below
 * List of available equipment
 * Proposed timeline
 * At least one client reference for similar work

We estimate that the three shorter shoots will take between four and five hours, including a total of two hours for travel, and that the longer shoot will take between five and seven hours. Candidates should estimate their own post-production and delivery hours.

Responsibilities:
Imagine a field of haystacks. In one of those haystacks is a needle. You need that needle. And then you wake up. Is this something you remember as a nightmare you want to forget? Or is this a dream that compels you night after night? If this is a dream, you might be the kind of eccentric individual we’re looking for.
We have moved beyond the traditional FUD approach of security and depend on data for analysis. What this means is guesswork and speculation must be supported with data. Put simply: data or it didn’t happen. However, data is all well and good, but it’s just sitting there doing nothing. Without intelligence and interpretation, we’re just filling up disks. While the storage companies are more than happy to sell us petabytes of spindles, we are driven to make something of this data. We need someone to join our team that lives, breathes, eats, and sleeps security data and the associated analysis.
&lt;management speak&gt;
Salesforce.com has one of the best Information Security teams in the world and growing this piece of the business is a top priority! Our Information Security teams work hand in hand with the business to ensure the highest security around all of our applications. With our focus on Trust, we generate terabytes per day of interesting security data. The Senior Detection and Response Researcher will help turn that data into actionable intelligence to help protect our customers from all types of threats. The threat landscape has changed from ‘if’ to ‘when,’ and we’re building a team that lives in this new reality.
On a daily basis, the researcher (we like to use the cooler-sounding term ‘hunter’) will analyze malware samples to determine impact on the Salesforce.com environments, pore through threat feeds for matches, read log files for hidden treasures, and investigate compromised hosts. Our researchers will also participate within various security communities as active contributors not only for the benefit of Salesforce.com, but for the benefit of the Internet as a whole.
&lt;/management speak&gt;
No overloaded, meaningless, three letter acronyms were harmed in the making of this job description.
Required skills:
Reverse malware in your sleep, laughing at lame obfuscation techniques. IDEs for scripting? Vi (or EMACS, if you must) are your tools. Who needs type-ahead completion when you’ve got your script language of choice memorized? Infected systems just speak to you, spinning a story of the compromise from exploitation to persistence. You didn’t write Volatility (or maybe you did!), but you could write a book on how to use it. Packers, debugger detection, and other tricks are speedbumps for others, but don’t even give you a second thought. Others curl up with a great book, you curl up with logs for a good read to help you sleep at night. Another operating system? You helped beta test it. You know it already. Network packet ninja, reconstructing fragments in your head. Those online regular expression sites are yesterdays joke to you; regular expressions are just as easy as banging out an email. Finding malware in a pile of malware is easy: just write a YARA sig. Same goes for finding malware in a pile of packets: just write a Snort sig. Collecting baseball cards and comics are cool, but collecting exploit kits is much cooler. Even cooler is fingerprinting them as they pop up and recognizing they’re using the latest Java exploit. Criminals and malware authors can’t hide their fingerprints from your Google-fu. You developed Indicators of Compromise before the term was coined. Blogging is something you do, you have done, or you will in the future. You’ve got the ability to explain malicious activities to our CEO (he’s a smart guy!). Desired skills:
Ideally, you’ve done all of the above at scale. We’re not a startup. Attribution is a lame sport, but campaign analysis and actor correlation are old hat to you. Off the shelf programs don’t exist for all of your needs, so you’ve built your tools, and tools for others.

I am a creative and resourceful freelance video editor with a strong sense of emotion, timing and story telling. 

I adapt my editorial style to suit the project in hand and feel I can connect effectively with the anticipated audience of a project. 

As a freelancer, I don't take a ""know it all"" attitude. Far from it. I am always looking for opportunities to work under and learn from professionals with more experience than myself. As such, I have experience in a variety of demanding post production roles and I feel my mix of creative and technical skills compliment each other well.

I've worked hard to put together equipment and work-flows that make my clients lives easier and often more cost effective. I am equally happy integrating into your team or providing editing facilities and equipment in my Soho, NY offices.

I have extensive experience with different digital formats, compression rates and multimedia platforms  from a technical and creative perspective.

I look forward to hearing about your project.

It can be a standalone app or a web app (whatever you feel comfortable with).
Overview: I am looking to have a app created that takes guitar TABS and plays them back visually on a screen. A user would log into their interface and upload a TAB that they have downloaded or the software would find the tab from a URL provided. For example a user would look at this tab (http://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/m/metallica/nothing_else_matters_intro_tab.htm) and it would show visually how to play the song in the UI.

Once the tab has loaded the UI would show a guitar that demonstrates where the tab is being played step by step.

How Tabs Work: A guitar tab is a set of text instructions that shows you how to play a song step by step on a guitar. Every tab has a designated holding position and place to strum on a guitar. I can show you in greater detail how this works.

Here is an example of what I am looking for but for the piano and midi. - http://mudcu.be/piano/

I work at British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and my group, BAS Information Services, is hiring a open-ended web systems developer position.
You can view the full job description here: http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/employment/vacancies/job.php?JobID=850

You'd be working in a very small team that is responsible for internal and external facing web services. We support a wide variety of systems. We work with linux based systems for all external websites and all scientific areas and with Microsoft SharePoint for our internal intranet.

Our external websites are primarily coded in PHP using MySQL and Oracle for the backends.

You will be the primary person for supporting our business systems and Sharepoint intranet. As we are a small team this generally means you'll be contributing to all and the other members will be as well but you'll be the point-of-contact and leader for your projects.

Here's an example of some of the kinds of systems you'd help support and develop:

* Sharepoint based intranet - general content and integrating external data sources
* PHP/mysql travel database - tracking employee movements to the Antarctic
* Business Management Tools for tracking business goals - dashboard style systems
* Public facing websites include wordpress - www.antarctica.ac.uk, www.arctic.ac.uk
* Photo database - http://www.photo.antarctica.ac.uk

As needed it could also involve more scientific oriented systems:

* Web mapping systems using Geoserver, openlayers and ExtJS - http://map.arctic.ac.uk/home/
* Scientific metadata and data systems - http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/dms/

As these have grown up in time and were initially developed by different teams you may need to be comfortable in multiple languages. Some are PHP or Perl and obviously sharepoint is none of these. We don't realistically expect you to be able to do everything right away but being good and one with the ability to learn to work in other areas would be perfect. 

I know that asking for a sharepoint and lamp web systems person may be a tall order but if you're really comfortable with sharepoint then learning enough to support the other systems should be well within your grasp. And vice versa. 

The job is based in Cambridge, UK and you'll have to be here in person. You must be eligible to work in the EU to hold this post. 
The pay range is £26,450 to £29,710. Yes, this is not a lot for this kind of work and you'll have a pretty good chance of starting at the top of the band. I know this isn't a very competetive salary but we do have very generous working conditions. There are 30 days annual leave and also 10.5 bank and privilege holidays. We work on a 37 hour work week that has a flexi system. If you want to work four 12 hour days and take a 3 day weekend you can.

This is a scientific institute that is funded by the UK government and other scientific grants and has been the subject of a pay freeze for many years now. We're a good team with some good people and we do care about the work we do. You'll get to work on varied projects and help contribute to the overall direction of web systems at BAS. 

Frankly I know we're asking a ridiculously low amount of money but that's the reality of publicly funded research institutions. The upside is it's an amazing place to work and we'll arrange it so you can hang out with a sea spider or eat a piece of 10,000 year old ice. I can't guarantee you'll hang out with a penguin but we'll try. That's worth a half-market value salary, right? 

I'm one of the lowly underpaid team members and it took three years but I eventually got to some computer stuff in weird places:

http://imgur.com/a/Q0ILf
http://www.reddit.com/r/windowshots/comments/ar2xo/from_my_temporary_office_at_a_research_station_in/

For real though, there is no guarantee you would get to go to the Antarctic or on a ship but we would try. If a project had a need we'd do it. I've gone but it took four years for the first reason to come up. Others went within six months. 

The applications for the job are done online but feel free to ask me any questions about the post.

The terms:

* I design 3 initial different concepts for you after you tell me what you want.

* Then you review them, tell me what you like/don't like and you choose 1 of them to develop it further (or if you don't like any of them, I can design a new batch for $50 extra)

* You get **unlimited** revisions for free (that means I will work until you are 100% satisfied with the result, even if it takes a month)

* I work in Illustrator (vector) so your logo will be completely scaleable and printable. Also you get .AI / .EPS and .PNG and .JPG and .PSD (layered) of the final logo

* You pay **after** I design the perfect logo for you but before I send you the source files

* Payment methods: PayPal, via Freelancer, Moneybookers (Skrill), or if you want to ask about something else - drop me a PM

The price range starts from 200$ for typical logo design work, but this is just so you know what to expect. For actual price for your project contact me with information. 

I know that some of you are on a low budget and you are used to seeing designers work for $30 on some forums, but this is totally different. I am talking about the real process of designing a brand image, something your company can proudly stand behind. Also please be aware that communication is key, the more you succeed in telling me what you want the better.

If you're wondering about a time frame the designs are usually completed in under a week, but of course that depends from a lot of things.

I'm sick of conventional sales people and I just don't like it. Conventional sales people often do not take into account capacity or operational capability when selling. They just see green and grab.

Maybe you are technical and that would give you an edge? Maybe you're not technical but you've got the right personality for sales? You're willing to learn about Managed Services, our value prop and earn your way up?
Email me your information. 

Send me your resume, send me why you think you'd be a good sales person and why you think you could sell Managed Services. If you get a call back, I'd hope you know what Managed Services is and could at least try and pitch at a high level.
Stand out from the rest of the pack and let me know how your going to sell, how you're going to generate leads and spend your week generating new sales...

Compensation is based on experience and will likely be salary + performance based compensation.

Basically, we're a company that provides the in car and back office solutions for police departments. We have a building in China that produces the hardware and we develop the software here in Texas.

Our current solution is an old VB6 implementation that we are trying to move away from. I actually just joined myself and I really like the company. I hate VB6, but any new stuff is all done in C#.

We just lost a developer, so we're looking to replace her. The job description doesn't mention it, but you'll probably have to work with VB6 about 50% of the time. We have to continue to update the VB6 solution while we work on creating the C# solution.

The job description doesn't highlight the mobile development experience a lot, but that's really what my boss wants. We have a new product coming out that is Android based, instead of Windows, and none of us have any experience working with Android yet. They hired a contractor to do the initial development, but they want to bring it in house eventually.

However, if you have any experience in Axapta, even if unrelated to these roles, feel free to apply as well.

We are located in Saint-Laurent, but the job might require you to drive to a few locations, often in the south shore. The job is mostly about a large ERP (enterprise resource planning) system, called Microsoft Dynamic AX 2012 (older versions are 3.0, 4.0, 2009), made by Microsoft to have an alternative to the other ERPs on the market, notably SAP and Oracle ERP. What distinguishes AX from the others, mainly, is that it's extremely flexible and allows developers to customize it entirely.

Considering that this is a very specific subject that most people have not heard about, we are willing to hire new grads with few or no prior job experience, and teach them everything from scratch. 

Here are some of the perks : 

* Full compensation, even while in training.
* Covered by our insurance plan
* Company laptop
* Company cell phone (Iphone or Windows phone) OR we pay your personal phone's bill
* Fuel is paid (50c per kilometer)
* Profit sharing bonuses, starting 6 months after employment
* Extremely good opportunities for growth (as our company grows so fast)

* English
* French (not absolutely mandatory, but strongly encouraged)
* Bachelor degree or similar education, OR experience in AX (experienced self-taught developers may apply too)
* Open mind and good teamwork
* Good communication skills

We are currently looking to hire some new webcam models to put on live streaming shows for our viewers. We receive over 5 million unique viewers each an every day! So our models get the most out of the time that they spend online. Our models make $100-250 an hour, we have people that work for us who do this for a living, as well as just earning some extra cash on the side. If you have ever been interested in stepping into the adult industry this is the best way to go. An allow me to tell you why this is the best method of getting your foot into the door. If you want to do porn, or think that you want to do porn but have never been naked in front of a camera or a group of other people who will be watching and filming you it is something that you either like it or you don't. So with a webcam show you get to work from the comfort, and privacy of your own home, while still experiencing what is it like to be in front of a camera fully nude with other people watching you. Also if you go out an get yourself into some print or film work, once it has been put out there for everyone to see it does not go away. So if someone who you do not want knowing that you are in this industry finds out well to bad, its there an its not going away. However with webcam shows There is the live stream to the show, and that is all that there is. Once you turn the webcam off thats it, it's all done. So this is an excellent way to get your feet wet in the adult industry.

We're part of Startupbootcamp Berlin which means you'll have people like Eric Wahlforss and Andreas Ehn coming in and out of your office every day.

RoR intern:  Are you a smart programmer who would like the experience of working on a real-world rails backend for a hot startup?  We're looking for an enthusiastic intern with good coding skills.  Ideally, this intern would be an experienced ruby/rails coder, familiar with the fundamentals of modern web programming (html/css/ajax).  Candidates should a have github profile that demonstrates their curiosity with modern open-source tools.  Make no mistake... this is a chance to work on real projects for one of the best startups in Berlin. You will commit some legit rails code that will be immediately used in production and learn a ton about how development works in the early-stage startup world.

hiring process in a way that emphasizes skills rather than pedigree.
Candidates submit our common app, which require them to do real work

of humans + technology to evaluate our applicants and match them to
jobs.

This is real.  We've already gotten tons of people hired for jobs they
love and candidates spend hours at a time on our site. Employers
(including big corporations and some of the best start-ups in Silicon
Valley) say we're saving them time and money and we’re earning real
revenue after just 6 months.

We’re looking for our first engineering hire: someone who is literate
in the full stack with one or two strong areas. Rails experience is a
plus but not required. Your work will touch on new problems in labor
economics, online education, recruiting, and UX/UI. As the company
grows we hope you’ll take on a leadership role.

Our backgrounds include working in the quantitative strategy group at
Goldman Sachs, creating the career center of the largest online
university in the country, and working as an analyst at McKinsey.

I assume an experienced programmer could knock this out in an afternoon. I can manually do it, however it would take me roughly 2 days to download each record.

I need it completely re-done (namely just [GSC](http://gsc.thegcw.com)).
I'm willing to pay USD for it.

You can use a modded version of wordpress, design your own CMS, or whatever is easiest/fastest.

Here's what I need:

* The entire initial set up of the CMS itself
* All comics (GSC) up to present added (storyline only. Use current GSC for guidance)



The CMS must have the following features:

* First comic ever, last comic uploaded, next, previous button navigation
* first comic of previous 'chapter' (see [gaia newsroom](http://www.gaiaonline.com/newsroom/)'s updates. Each thumb is a 'chapter'), first comic of next 'chapter' button navigation

* date comic page premiered on Gaia (I'm not expecting you to find this info. When you make the CMS, just leave a blank spot for me to enter it)
* Comic page # of # (of current 'chapter')
* Comic page # (of total comic pages in GSC)
* Special features/considerations for particular pages (namely [Xmas 2k4](http://thegcw.com/wordpress/?p=15) and [MMVII](http://thegcw.com/wordpress/?p=409))
* All content is loaded in an encapsulating table, iframe, or div that is easy to put in various website interfaces (so I can change the layout without too much hassle)
* content inside said div/table/iframe is centered and uses fluid/liquid margins, not absolute values.
*  New chapters/pages/comics easily uploaded/updated by myself without further assistance (A GUI would be nice in that).



If you look at http://gsc.thegcw.com, you'll see what I've got. I'm basically just looking for a more efficient version of that (and someone to do the initial setup for me because I don't have the time). 

I will probably change the site's layout if this project ever gets off the ground. You don't need to design a layout, just a database and/or CMS that works decently.

I currently am using a modded version of wordpress someone else set up for me for free (and then disappeared from the internet). I'm now locked out of this, as it was set up for a domain that has since expired (thegcw.net) and it won't allow me to login. I needed to re-upload most of the crap anyway, since some stuff was out of order.

**Relevant information**

thegcw.com is a fansite to gaiaonline.com. All my website is, is a ""better"" archive of their storyline comics. I make no money off it, and I don't run any ads. Gaia Online knows of its existence (I made it in 2006 or so and didn't go inactive with it until about 2009-2010) and they haven't made a fuss over it. If they do, I'll take it down... For the time being though, this site is just my baby and I unfortunately don't have time to redo it myself; so I'm paying someone else to.

If you have some background/experience with Gaia Online, it's helpful, but absolutely not necessary.

**If you can do this project, please comment OR PM with** 

**(1) estimated amount of time it would take you** 

**(2) what you would need (how many databases, ftp accounts, etc.) and your plan of action (install/mod wordpress, create CMS from scratch, etc.)**

I've been programming for three years now, self taught. Started out with C, got to be comfortable with that, meddled in Visual C++ 2008 and made a gradebook program that went on to national level competition (FBLA). That was in my sophomore year of high school.

I then decided to start learning Java. I started to experiment with 2d graphics, made a 2D game for web browsers called SurrounDots ( http://rowell95.webs.com/SurrounDots.html ) which I made by the end of the month I started learning Java.
 
I then wanted to port the game to Android, which I did in about a week, with a quick crash course in Android development and animation algorithms for Android ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrew.surroundot )
 
After that I made a game, for desktops, in Java, for a competition similar to the one I entered my Visual C++ gradebook program in (same group running the competition, different category.) I organized a group of three members, including me and two other students, one of which wrote and produced the music for the game. It's designed to teach personal finance to high school kids.

You are a multitalented web developer. We are going to kick ass and then hi-five nine times. Apply right this very second or refer a friend and, if selected, get $1000 as a signing/referral bonus.

Dear the Internets,

We are an unusual design firm: we are very a multidisciplinary, fairly crazy team, with a strong background in software, visual design, and experimental projects. We spend most of our time creating non-profit ventures for community and personal value and spend the rest of our time dreaming up and building innovative concepts for commercial clients.

A recent web-app concept has just been green-lit by a local client and we would like to work with a Boston-based freelancer, who will engage the software architecture and direct our front-end staff to build a roadmap (this month), conduct research alongside our client (this month), and manage the web-app build-out (next several months). 

We are looking for:
-web stuff: javascript/jquery, html/css, php, [other bonus goodies you might have], and a good eye for design
-stuff the cool kids are doing: software architecture chops, java and/or objective-c, python…impress us with your prior work!


The firm's founders are MIT CSAIL (Ph.D.) and MIT Media Lab alums and have expanded the firm to an awesome group of collaborators and interns.
We did this (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkYfB1C0Zgc) viral video for OK Go, and have also done analytics, consulting, production, and software for Showtime, Discovery, Samsung, MTV, and others.

Right off the Central Square T stop (20 feet away!), we have a great work space. We boast 3 lasercutters and all kinds of expensive photo/video equipment for art-nights and your personal use.

It's good times - PM me or tell your friends!
SIGNING/REFERRAL BONUS: If you or your friend interviews for (and is selected for) this freelance job on Sunday (today), you get $1000 cash. If Monday, you get $500 cash.

My expertise when it comes to actually creating a website is virtually nil, however, and I know a good developer/designer is worth his/her weight in gold, so I'm looking for a partner.

I say partner because, alas, I cannot afford to pay you what you're worth upfront; until the sites start making money, we'll both be working on hope.  This is not some ""once we reach this threshold I'll start paying you"" scheme, however; **you will start making money from the time of our first sale, and sales permitting you will be compensated for all initial work, not just work that takes place after the money-making begins**.  I know these deals are a dime a dozen and that a developer's work is often undervalued, and this is not my intention, I simply don't have the several thousand dollars you ought to get paid.  We can discuss the percentage of sales/profits you want and other details once you know a bit more about the company, sales expectations, workload, etc.

The sites will be fairly basic in setup and I will take care of all written content.  Marketing and all customer services aspects of the company will also be taken care of by me and a few freelancers (non-programming) I already have lined up.  If we start making money at the levels I'm hoping to, this could become a very regular job, if you're interested.

Given the fact that I can't pay upfront, I'm not looking for lengthy resumes or loads of experience (though neither would hurt).  You can still be a student, just starting out, sixty years old and starting a second career--if you possess the necessary knowledge and skills and are willing to put in the work, awesome.  If you don't possess the necessary knowledge and skills, we'll both know pretty quickly.

The only other requirements are that you are 18 and legally employable in the United States.  I am incorporated in Washington State and you will be signing either a freelancer or a limited partnership contract (no liability with a buy-out clause) once we agree on a payment arrangement/work to be completed.  

Hoping to get started ASAP, so please leave a comment or send me a PM if you're interested, and we can discuss more details privately.",,False,,t5_2qzdl,False,,,True,t3_l9rg2,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobbit/comments/l9rg2/hiring_web_designerdeveloper_for_a_family_of/,

I am applying a crowd sourcing model to a business which has not seen one yet.  The website will reflect this.  Right now I manage the process by email but that is becoming cumbersome.

The website must have the following:

* An auction system - clients post their job requests, users bid on those requests
* User reviews - clients must be able to rate users and write reviews
* Integration with an online merchant system - paypal would be fine

Right now theres just two of us, but our startup has major potential (everyone says that, I know). Looking for some people who would be interested in spending the summer in Chicago, Cali or Colorado (depending on where we get accepted) working on a a never before seen concept. We want to rent a house in one of those cities and all work on this project like a fraternity... 

What we bring: -A fully functional prototype using: objective C (iOS) Java for Android, HTML 5 (front end) and .NET (server side) and the Azure cloud. -Business/marketing team -Capital -The promise of a summer filled with gorgeous women, partying and long nights grinding away a computer while drinking Milwaukee's Best. -The opportunity to build professional connections, learn the startup game and build something special. -EQUITY -living expenses of $100 per day

What we need: -Rock star developers, who are confident building massively scalable programs in the cloud. Familiarity with video/picture uploading and common APIs (Google maps, FB, Twitter, etc). -Laid back, but hard working people that like to smash out heavy coding sessions but then also hit the bar and smash the after party. People with vision and the drive to innovate and who want more than to just work for some boring software or app company.

In summary we are looking to build a great team for the summer at least and then hopefully continue on into a venture round.

Get back to me if you're interested at all, if you think you could bring something to the table (even if its not listed above here, hell maybe you're a killer Python hacker and want to help), if you think I'm an idiot and that this ad is unprofessional, or if you just want to chat!
