When the sub was started, there was no notion of tenured professors jumping ship and starting new companies. No one thought anything of Sebastian Thrun's AI class not being listed for a second term; at least, no more than the DB course not returning. MIT hadn't even acknowledged the experiment yet.

We're not there anymore.

The sub was started with the intent to follow what would later become Coursera. As you might have noticed, I haven't been moderating based on that principle at all. With classes about to start at Udacity, the delays at Coursera, MITx's announced release timeframe approaching, the rapid expansion of Khan Academy, and the general maturation of university-sponsored interactive online learning all in the last few months, I think this is a good time to more formally decide our purpose.

At minimum, I'd like our sidebar to reflect what we actually want to be. Do we want to just focus on Coursera? Should we give Udacity equal coverage? What about other interactive platforms, like Carnegie Mellon's OCI? What about simpler video lectures? What about non-university resources like Khan Academy? What about resources that aren't aimed at the high school to early grad studies demographic? What about commercial resources and platforms? What about resources that aren't structured like classes at all, like the Bengali library I just threw into the fiery pits of spam hell? What about resources like [aiqus](http://www.aiqus.com) that help facilitate classes without any sort of official association?

All thoughts and discussion are appreciated!

&gt;Hi 

&gt;Thank you for your interest in AI Class and congratulations to those who successfully graduated. We were totally amazed that over 23,000 students made it all the way to the end in a Stanford graduate-level class.

&gt; Due to popular demand, we are teaching a follow-up class: AI for Robotics at www.udacity.com . Also due to popular demand, we now have a programming environment, so you can develop and test software. Our goal is to teach you to program a self-driving car in 7 weeks. This is a topic very close to my heart, and I am eager to share it with you. (This class builds on the concepts in ai-class, but ai-class is NOT required).

&gt; We are also launching an introduction to programming class, where students will learn to program a search engine, without any prior knowledge of programming. This will be great for students new to computer science.

&gt; We are doing this with a new university: Udacity. In the next months, we will offer an entire computer science curriculum through Udacity, and offer certification services so that an entire degree can be obtained online.

&gt; I would love to see you in class again! I would also love if you could help us spread the word and recruit students. Udacity is an experiment in democratizing education, in making free education available for everyone in the world. It can only succeed if you join us and help spread the word.

This was the 'real' start of MOOCs, and in one year they have made an enormous step forwards.  
Coursera now has 33 universities working with it and has a very large variety of subjects, Udacity is closing in on being a full CS/programming education and edX went from 'just' MITx to three top universities working together.
  
But those are just the big guys, but there's also:  
 [10gen](http://education.10gen.com/) about mongoDB,  
[venture lab](https://venture-lab.org/) and [Class2Go](http://class.stanford.edu/), two different efforts by stanford with various subjects,  
[OpenHPI](https://openhpi.de/) by the German Hasso Plattner Institute, giving two CS courses,  
[MrUniversity](http://mruniversity.com/), started just for the web with a development economics course,  
[Brown university](http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/OnLine/) that seems to be testing the waters with a programming languages course.

**About the Course**

&gt;Fantasy is a key term both in psychology and in the art and artifice of humanity. The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale to kiddie lit to myth; from ""Cinderella"" to Alice in Wonderland to Superman; from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction, from Frankenstein to Avatar, is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind, shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears. This course will explore Fantasy in general and Science Fiction in specific both as art and as insights into ourselves and our world. 

**Course Syllabus**

&gt;This course comprises ten units. Each will include a significant reading, typically a novel or a selection of shorter works. I will offer video discussions of each of the readings and also of more general topics in art and psychology that those readings help illuminate. Each unit will include online quizzes and ask you to write a brief essay offering your own insights into the reading. In order, the units are:

Grimm — Children's and Household Tales

Carroll — Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass

Stoker — Dracula

Shelley — Frankenstein

Hawthorne &amp; Poe — Stories and Poems

Wells — The Island of Dr. Moreau, The Invisible Man, ""The Country of the Blind,"" ""The Star""

Burroughs &amp; Gilman — A Princess of Mars &amp; Herland

Bradbury — The Martian Chronicles

LeGuin — The Left Hand of Darkness

Doctorow — Little Brother


&gt;In Unit I, the specific stories are the ones in the Lucy Crane translation (1886) which was published by Dover and is available online through Project Gutenberg. In Unit V, the specific readings are: Hawthorne's ""The Birthmark,"" ""Rappaccini's Daughter,"" ""Dr. Heidegger's Experiment,"" and ""The Artist of the Beautiful""; Poe's ""The Fall of the House of Usher,"" ""The Tell-Tale Heart,"" ""The Black Cat,"" ""The Oval Portrait,"" ""The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar,"" ""The Bells,"" ""The Raven,"" ""Annabel Lee."" All the readings except Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles and Ursula K. LeGuin's The Left Hand of Darkness will be available online at no charge.
