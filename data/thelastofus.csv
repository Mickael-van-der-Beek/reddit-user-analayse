1371799313.0,282,self.thelastofus,1gs6r8,The ending: Dissatisfied or feel like something is missing? My take on it and why... (MAJOR spoilers obviously),keftih,323,41,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gs6r8/the_ending_dissatisfied_or_feel_like_something_is/,"And why the ending is actually the best and happiest possible ending for Joel and Ellie.


After I beat the game today, there was this feeling of discomfort. What the hell, Joel?? Something just seem so damn out of place. The ending seemed like such a shock to me. There was just something at the back of my mind when Joel lied twice to Ellie at the end, something maybe even sinister. I thought more and more about the development of the characters and what the world had become. I ask, did Joel's character suddenly take a sharp turn for the worst? Did he finally succumb to his desperate search for a companion, greedily snatching up Ellie for himself and denying the world its cure? I vote for No, and this is why:


The Ending

*At first* it seemed like Joel had simply snapped. He had lost Sarah, his daughter, and Tess, his companion (possibly partner), and it hurt. It might not be too obvious, but Joel actually has the most sensitive personality in the story, but is hidden behind his violence. Evidence of this is his absolute refusal to even acknowledge the deaths of the people he is close to. He tries to hide it under the guise of ""things happen, and we move on"". Joel comes off as a stoic kind of guy, but he actually hurt very easily; ""you are treading on some mighty thin ice"" at Ellie with just the mention of Sarah. Throughout the entire game, Joel is looking for someone to fill the missing roles in his life, someone to trust, love and be his companion. He only realizes that this person is Ellie after almost losing her in the Winter chapter.

With that in mind, let's go to the ending. Joel, supposedly and selfishly denies Man his cure. He kills at least one doctor and the leader of the Fireflies in cold blood on his way out. It almost looks like a kidnapping, where the twisted kidnapper takes a child from her home and raises her under a lie. This was my initial impression. I've read several other interpretations that say Joel is the actual villain in the game, but otherwise likeable due to the great character development throughout the game. I'm not sure I entirely agree with that. I'll explain. I argue that the while Joel's act of saving Ellie was motivated by some selfishness, it is less selfish than what the world wants from her, in that Joel's ending may lead to Ellie living a somewhat enjoyable life with Joel. Ellie can learn how to play the guitar and how to swim. She can do what defines us as human beings from animals. Meanwhile, the rest of Mankind just wants a cure and then they can go back to killing and cannibalizing each other (only without the interruption of infected).

Okay so: the kidnapping. At the very start of the level, I was thinking ""Joel, what are you doing. Isn't the operation going to save the world?"" And then I was angry at the game. The game is making me stop the operation. There's no way to continue the story unless I kill these people. Is this really how it ends? The ending plot twist seemed so forced or out of place. However, after the game, and I think many people may have realized about this before even reaching the last chapter, but why the hell do we even want to save Mankind anymore. Any nice people are few and far in between (or dead). You've killed so many people, but they only want to kill you back to survive. The title of the game is ""The Last of Us"" This plays on the central them of Us vs Them. While the infected certainly belong to the ""Them"" side, it is interesting that practically everyone else (besides Joel and Ellie) can also be lumped with ""Them"". There is a rather wide disconnect between Joel and Ellie vs the rest of everyone else, even among allies. They are paired against the world. There is a constant feeling of danger everywhere. The only place of absolute peace is when Joel and Ellie are staring out onto the field with the Giraffes, notably where there are no humans. The game makes a statement that *Mankind may be past worth saving* . Even with a cure, how can people possibly return to normality after so long brutally surviving. So why should Joel sacrifice the only person left in the world who he cares about to save some goddamn rotten Mankind. The Fireflies want a cure, that is certain, however, what motivation do they have to give the cure to the government, who have all but mercilessly wiped all of their friends out? What prevents them from keeping the cure to themselves, using as a leverage. This is all speculation, as not much is known about the Fireflies. However, the point is that the cure does not necessarily lead to any happier ending then without one. Furthermore, another question lingers: Should this have been Ellie's choice?

Given from Ellie's depression in the previous level, it looked like she might have been ready to sacrifice anything to provide a cure. However, even then, is this the morally right path? Mankind is fucked up. According to the Fireflies, the only way to save it is to use Ellie's life. Let's look at the weight of this action again: The only way to save Man is to cut up a little girl and to study her brain? The game makes a clear distinction between Mankind and Humanity here. If the Joel had let the Fireflies sacrifice Ellie, then this Mankind as species may be saved, but at the cost of the last piece of humanity that we have seen in the story: the relationship between Joel and Ellie. (Tommy's camp may be seen as an exception, but as foreshadowed in the game, how long can they really last being continually picked apart by the outside? A larger questions looms, are they even better than the bandits? Remember they were ready to blow Joel's head off if it weren't for Tommy's intervention) On the other hand, if Joel saves Ellie, and gives Ellie a chance at life, then they can continue to share a genuinely loving, father-daughter relationship that is really one of a kind in the last pockets of the Earth. Yes, Joel's decision was selfish, but in the choice between Mankind's selfishness to sacrifice **anything** in order to continue to exist and Joel's selfishness to continue to survive with Ellie, Joel wins in my book. Thus, I argue, given the state of the world, the ending is actually the best possible outcome.

The last few lines of the game reveal that Ellie had been dealing with ""survivor's guilt,"" in that she lived while her best friend died, giving her a sense of responsibility or obligation. Would Ellie have volunteered herself for the surgery. I think it is a most likely **yes** . Ellie feels a need to sacrifice herself so that her survival over her friend's death would mean something more, that she could somehow repay her friend. Ellie is essentially a slave to this guilt, sacrificing herself is not something she wants to do at all, but rather this is something she feels like she *has* to do. In the previous section, Ellie recalls having a dream in which she is in a crashing plane and that, although she is in the cockpit, she can't change course because she doesn't know how to pilot the plane. This is a metaphor for her spiraling path towards her ultimate sacrifice. She WANTS control, but doesn't know how she possibly can with this feeling of obligation hanging over her. Enter Joel (named after a prophet?). Joel is Ellie's guide. It's always ""What now Joel"" or ""Tell me what to do, Joel."" Joel prevents her from having to take this unfair path by saving her from the hospital. In a time when it seemed like there were only two choices, (let Ellie die and save Mankind or save Ellie and let Mankind die), a subtle, but different third choice can be realized: It's not even about Mankind at all. Mankind has left the equation long ago. It has no longer been worth saving. It's only about saving Ellie or letting her die. The last shred of humanity is between Joel and Ellie. Mankind has already been screwed now for a long time. In fact, nature seems to be doing just fine without people around at all. From Ellie's point of view, it is paramount that Joel saves her without her consent and then lies to her. How could she, in her mind, ""betray"" her friend by refusing the surgery? In the very end, Ellie asks Joel if everything he told her about the Fireflies was true (that they don't need her for a cure anymore), and Joel says yes. It is strong suggested, even by the [creators](http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/06/18/major-spoilers-naughty-dog-talks-the-last-of-us-beginning-ending-and-slightly-alternate-ending/), that Ellie suspects that Joel has lied to her. However, she knowingly accepts this lie. In fact she NEEDS this lie in order to cope with her guilt and to continue surviving. How can she turn her back on Man? Is it really her responsibility to give her life to save Mankind, simply for the sake of continuing the species despite what it had become? What about her best friend? She needs this lie so that she can take control of her life, because Mankind isn't worth saving anymore. Notice the game ends with just Joel and Ellie. They aren't back in Tommy's camp, they aren't back in Boston finding a new home or anything like that. They are in the woods, away form the rest of people, because that's all they have left. In a world that's gone to shit, where pretty much everyone wants to kill each other, just step away from it all. All they need is each other i.e. "" **Us** "", hence the title The Last of Us.

So this is my interpretation. I've been seeing a lot of people feel depressed after finishing the game, so I hope this helps people feel a little more closure or clear some things up.

But this is the only time I really felt like I was forced to *survive.* A lot of people have said that this game is depressing, tiring, and physically draining. I think we all agree that's a great thing about this game. 

Before you even get halfway through with it you just want to lay down and quit. But you know you can't. You feel obligated to keep going and see this through to the end. I've never wanted to not finish and simultaneously finish a game before. 

Survival isn't easy in this game. You have to do whatever you can to live one more day. Shiv-ing a guy in the neck. Blowing a guy to pieces with a nail bomb. Burning him alive with a flamethrower.

1372848795.0,182,self.thelastofus,1hk6c1,"[SPOILERS, Mega Discussion!] Animal Symbolism, the threat of humans, the loss of faith in humanity and more…",keftih,205,23,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hk6c1/spoilers_mega_discussion_animal_symbolism_the/,"I see a lot of people say that Ellie becomes depressed after seeing a picture of the stag as it reminded her of what happened in David’s camp. While this is certainly one possibility, I think there’s a lot more to the picture here that is not being taken into account. I’m not sure how many people are willing to enter long discussions about symbolism and themes (or if people will even make it to the end of this) but perhaps one day someone will finish the game and stumble upon this post. Here are four points here that I would like to present.

1. The symbolism of Deer and Giraffe
2. The greater threat of Man in contrast to the infection
3. The loss of faith in humanity
4. Henry and Sam, as literal losses of humanity

Stag symbolism is a recurring symbol that is present in three significant locations that I can recall: A painting above Joel’s bed in his room (in the prologue), the deer that Ellie hunts in the Winter chapter, and once again in the following chapter right at the beginning (Spring starts with Ellie staring at a pictorial carving of deer). Interestingly, these images appear right before (arguably) the greatest dangers in the game. Namely, these are: the soldier that kills Sarah, the introduction of David, and the fireflies (for the surgery of Ellie). Perhaps even more peculiar is the fact that in all three circumstances, it was people, and not the infected, that are the greatest threat. Despite the attention drawn to the infected, this isn’t a “zombie” game, this is a game that portrays people killing other people. **The deer represents the relative harmlessness of nature, juxtaposing the greater threat of Man.**

From our perspective in the comforts of our mostly intact society, the conflict in this game is between Man and Infected. This is our “united” response, in which we expect humans to cooperate in order to fight a foreign invader. However, after 20 years of losing battles, the game shows us that the conflict has actually evolved, the true war has become Man against himself. In other words, **at some point after the outbreak, the responsibility for the demise of Man passed from the infected to humans**. The infected were just a catalyst, breaking down the restricting walls of society. However, once people realized that common “law” was no longer applicable and the infrastructure that relied upon could no longer provide, people began to do anything they could to survive at the cost of others. Humanity began to wage war against itself. Let’s go through each deer appearance.

The deer above Joel bed: As you recall, Joel is carrying Sarah away as Tommy holds the infected back. As you hurry down the dirt road, an infected chases you and even begins to gain on you. The main focus is on the infected, because they are the primary threat... right? However, what happens next. The soldier fires his gun, *easily* dispatching the infected, and kills Sarah (and almost Joel too). Yes, Joel was running from the threat of the infected, but who ultimately killed Sarah? It is perhaps ironic, that Joel believed he was running towards the safety of humans, yet in reality he was running towards the greater danger. It is important to point out that *it is at this is the point where Joel loses his faith in humanity.* Humans aren't allies, they're the bigger enemy. This serves as his background to the beginning of the game, where Joel has become a ruthless individual with the only goal of surviving. Even when presented with undeniable evidence that Ellie is immune, and that she might really lead to some cure, Joel is hesitant to personally continue the journey. This is because even with a vaccine, he no longer has faith in Mankind. Something to think about: The infected are relentless, but they are also nothing but animals. People have tools, guns, intelligence. Both groups want to kill you, who would you rather take your chances with? As Bill said (paraphrasing) infected are predictable, humans are the dangerous ones. 

The deer Ellie hunts: This one is rather straight forward. Ellie hunts the deer (representing Man’s war against nature), but by doing so, Ellie is lead straight to David, arguably the greatest threat you have faced up to this point in the game. The infected somehow show up, drawing the attention once again to them. Yet, the larger danger was with you the whole time: David. It is at the end of Winter chapter that Ellie loses her faith in humanity.

The deer carving at the beginning of Spring: This is the most important one as it sets the stage for the ending and whether you can say it was a “happy” one or not. While the deer once again represents the looming danger of Man in spite of the infected, it is more important to realize that **Ellie has also come to the same conclusion.** She is supposed to be miracle cure-all, but for what? Who killed Sarah? Tess? Who had come closest to killing Ellie and will once again nearly kill her? She began the journey so eager to pursue a cure, that the world was just like the quarantine zone, that despite its flaws, may be worth saving. Her journey with Joel has proven otherwise to her, with the turning factor being David's camp. This is the reason for her sadness during Spring. She may be haunted by her clash with David, but there is an even deeper depression caused by the fact that Ellie is compelled by her survivor’s guilt to seek a vaccine, but for a cause that she may no longer believe in. This is the primary reason Ellie accepts Joel’s lie at the end of the game. She accepts this lie as a way to escape from a life, where she would be a slave to her guilt, in order to save a race that she no longer believes in. This internal conflict is explained by an allegory in Spring, where Ellie describes how she is in a crashing plane. The plane represents humanity’s downfall. Ellie is trapped in the plane because her survivor’s guilt ties her to it. She will share the same fate as Man (and almost does had Joel not intervened), but in reality she doesn’t want to go down with the rest of Mankind. She tells Joel that she tries to pilot the plane, because she doesn't want to be stuck in this downward spiral anymore. Joel takes control by lying to her, metaphorically steering her away from the crash course. This wasn't really her decision, and it may seem dark, but accepting this lie was the only way for Ellie to move on.

What about the giraffes? First of all, it is interesting to note that virtually all animals in the game are harmless. This is symbolic for the fact that **it is impossible for nature to have malicious intent, this includes infected. ** Infected are driven by pure instinct. People are driven by intent. From a symbolic standpoint, Ellie is cheered up by the sight of giraffes because they represent the continuation of life, even with the absence of Mankind. This gives her hope that, despite what people may think, the extinction of Man is not the end of the world. If Ellie’s faith is no longer with humanity, she can place it in nature.

Finally, for the last topic. Sam and Henry are representative of humanity himself and his morals *before* the outbreak. In other words, the “old” humanity. Despite having little to no memory prior to the pandemic, they only take what they need, they give second chances, and they strive for relics of society (namely, the toy robot and motorcycle). They don’t exist simply to survive, they exist to live. The infection of Sam is a parallel to the beginning of the game. His infection was an outbreak no one expected, paralleling the loss of an innocent. The infection “kills” him (Is he actually dead? Or just converted into a different organism?) and the Henry kills him. Again the focus here is on the infected. However, *After shooting an infected, Henry then turns the gun on himself. This symbolizes Man’s war with nature evolving into Man’s war on Man, or the literal suicide of Mankind*. The story of Sam and Henry is a brief synopsis of Man’s beginning as well as foreshadowing of Man’s ultimate end.

So there’s a lot of topics here that I covered, and that’s mostly because many of the themes in the game are interconnected. It is difficult to talk about the significance of events without first explaining another. I’m not the best writing by any stretch of the imagination, but I hope I at least got some of my points across. Feel free to post your own opinions!

I know I'm not alone when I say that this game touched my very core. I'm really emotional about what I feel I have been through and I feel at this point that this subreddit is mainly a support group.

There have been other threads here discussing Joel's choice at the end. I think I might have a something new to offer.

You see the world Joel's been living in for 20 years is one that has, numerous times, sacrified the few to save the many. Soldiers kept survivors out of full quarantine zones. Soldiers were better fed then peasents. Families were forcefully separated. Infected people were killed before they became a danger. Groups of bandits killed lone travelers. The government evacuated impossible to defend places.

In one way or the other all these things at least potentially serve a larger group while a smaller group is harmed.

Hell, Joel's daughter got killed by a soldier by order of a General who thought he could still contain the outbreak.

I was first leaning towards sacrificing Ellie to possibly help humanity as a whole. But I'm really no longer sure this is a good thing. I now view it as an idealistic view by youngens and revolutionaries.

The world Joel's been living in is an inhumane one. I'm not sure it deserves saving. It certainly does not deserve grave sacrifices.

Besides, the only way a sacrifice for the many is ever justified, ever human, is if the people being sacrificied decide to do so. It is noble to save someone and give one's own live. It is not if you're forced to do it.

Ellie could not make that decision. Though mature for her age she did not yet know what she would be giving up. Had she been ten years older, she might have. At 14 this is something her parent or guardian must decide. 

Joel decided not to, because he is no idealist. From what we know he never was. If he had one bit of idealism in him it must have been wiped away by his loss and by his experience living in an infected and inhumane nightmare of a world.

Maybe nurturing what they both found, together in Tommy's town really is the sanest thing to do. Humanity lost against the fungus and it's going to be a long time before things can return back to normal.

Okay, so I loved this wallpaper, and I have it on my iPod and phone, but I couldn't find the right size for my computer.

I thought about adding a thought bubble over Ellie's head of a smiley face (to show she's happy) and a bubble with a brick over Joel's head, because that would be funny, but this looks pretty good.

I just finished the game last night, and I started reading all of the spoiler based posts finally and I've seen a lot of comments about Joel's ""selfishness"" at the end of the game. I am a bit confused as to why some people feel that Joel's actions in the end were selfish?

The way I saw it him saving Ellie was his first major **unselfish** act, and was a major turning point for his character in that regard.

Joel saved Ellie for Ellie because he cared about her more then he cared about himself. How is that selfish? 

Ellie never consented to being killed to find a cure, let alone be used to merely create a vaccine that likely would only give power to a rebel paramilitary group who's intentions we're not fully aware of.

After finding the notes, and recording Marlene left behind it seemed to be me like she had become mentally unstable, and was hell bent on finding a cure at any cost despite the fact her group did not appear to have the resources to do anything with a cure had they even been able to find one. Meanwhile, a cure wouldn't have really changed the world as they knew it anyway as the infected weren't as big a threat as other survivors were.

Joel figured out that Marlene was full of shit, and realized Ellie's life would be sacrificed in vain, and that Marlene was hell bent on something far outside her control.

Keep in mind it was Marlene who manipulated Ellie, Tess, and Joel into believing Ellie was the key to unlocking a cure in the first place, even though she likely  knew from the beginning that Ellie would not survive the procedure.

In the end, Joel saves Ellie from Marlene. Joel did not doom man kind by saving Ellie, he simply prevented her from dying needlessly at the hands of Marlene who's motivations seemed far more idealist, radical, and selfish. While Marlene convinced herself she was doing all of this for the greater good, it seemed clear she had lost her way.

The fact Joel lies to Ellie in the end was to protect her from finding out Marlene and the Fireflies intended to sacrifice her all along.

Thanks to Joel, Ellie now gets to live out the rest of her life healthy, and safe believing she did the right thing (which she did, it wasn't her fault she was manipulated by Marlene). That was a selfless act to protect Ellie, not himself.

Edit: It also occurred to me that by keeping Ellie alive, and taking her to a safe protected place she now has the ability to grow up, and pass her immunity on to her children eventually leading to a generation of immune humans. An alive and protected Ellie is actually the most probable way to ensure a future for humanity.

If the Fireflies truly had humanities best interests in mind, wouldn't they want to keep Ellie alive so she can pass on the trait naturally rather then sacrifice her for a vaccine? Killing the few immune people to try and save those who aren't immune is a rather short-sighted goal, whereas keeping her alive can actually naturally lead to immunity for her children, and their children.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,1371712293.0,spoiler,,True,t3_1gp0qm,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gp0qm/joels_selfishness_spoilers/,

1371522690.0,122,self.thelastofus,1gk61o,[BIG SPOILERS] My interpretation about the choice of clothing for Joel/ Ellie,sootybest,141,19,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gk61o/big_spoilers_my_interpretation_about_the_choice/,"So feel free to say I'm looking into this too deeply, but I've been interested in the concept art for the main characters and I think lots of end costume choices are made very deliberately in games like this. I've developed this interpretation about the clothing choices of Ellie and Joel and how they change with the seasons. Thought you guys 
might appreciate/ expand on it.

So first the obvious stuff. Ellie wears pink on her upper body in every season except for one- in the epilogue-y section of Spring. The is notable because Sarah also is shown wearing pink in the scenes she's in. The parallels are obvious (though it might be worth mentioning it could be significant Sarah wears pink on her lower body). The only other character really to wear pink is Tess, but it's a lot darker, almost purple-y pink. A quick google search will show pink is an archetypal colour associated with friendship, harmony, compassion, innocence etc. Simply, it seems that Ellie wears this because she is the compassionate foil to Joel. In contrast, Tess wearing a much darker shade shows that although she is a tough and brutal survivor character, deep down she also has shreds of compassion, which is shown when she admits they're ""shitty people"" and pleads with Joel to do the right thing and try and get Ellie to the Fireflies.

In the epilogue, though, Ellie's clothing has changed. She is wearing a distinctly red shirt, now. One would probably want to call it blood red. To me, this calls back the very end of the winter season. After Ellie kills David and leaves with Joel, the camera pans back to the machete, covered in blood. The first time I saw this, I recognised it as a sign of a loss of innocence. Ellie has killed before in the story, but never so brutally or impulsively. To be wearing this colour in the epilogue after wearing a colour of innocence for the entirety of the game speaks volumes of how Ellie's character has changed, embracing the brutal nature of her survival, whether she is aware of it or not.

But it's not just the change of colour of her shirt, either. It's the material. After wearing a t-shirt, a wind breaker, hoodie, and casual shirt all with pink on it, the red clothing is a flannel shirt. One that looks very similar not only to Joel's shirts in general but specifically the ones he wore in the fall/ winter months. So this single piece of clothing shows how Ellie has lost her innocence/embraced her brutal life-style with its colour, but it also tells us that in doing so she has become more like Joel. I find this a lovely little taste of irony, and it's irony because at this point in the story, even Joel is pretty conscious that he sees Ellie as a surrogate Sarah (he says ""you keep finding something to fight for"" in the epilogue, clearly referring that for him, it is now Ellie). But at this point in the story, just in the clothing, we know that Ellie has turned into something more like Joel than Sarah.

If Ellie's clothing show the dynamic nature of her character, though, Joel's shows how static his is.

Joel wearing a khaki green survivalist-type shirt in the summer section. Key word 'survivalist'. He does what it takes to survive. Simple. He wears similar button up flannel shirt in the fall/ winter. OK. But in the spring, he appears to be wearing the same shirt from the summer. To me this says that even though Joel has been through this epic journey, his core character has not changed. Although Joel has changed in his willingness to have a close relationship with someone, the clothing tells us he hasn't changed at the core. He is an anti-hero. The decisions he makes at the end of the game are the same ones that he would have made if in the same situation at the beginning of the game. And this is the shirt he is wearing when he tells Ellie that it's not too late to turn back. This is the shirt he is wearing when he says ""I guess you can't outrun your past"" (in response to Ellie handing him the photo of him and Sarah). This is the shirt he is wearing when he decides to rescue Ellie in the hospital. This is the shirt he is wearing when he reaffirms the lie about the Fireflies. He hasn't learnt a lesson or become a better person, and the moral implications of this in these situations are very interesting.

I think it's also important to point out that Ellie doesn't end up wearing a khaki green survivalist shirt, but a flannel shirt. This is the type of thing Joel wore in fall/ winter when he was accepting Ellie and bonding with her. Ellie does still not have the complete survivalist morality of Joel- she has become like Joel in the middle of the game. Somewhat more dynamic and compassionate.

On that note, in the winter section of the game, her pink hoodie is underneath a khaki green jacket. To me this is a symbol of how Ellie is still herself, but has had to put on a shell of Joel's survivalist morality on top. This is apt given these are the parts of the game you actually have to play as her, literally using the same techniques that you used to play as Joel.

Lastly, I think its weird, given this conclusion, that David pretty much wears the same outfit as Ellie ( he wears a pink shirt instead of a pink hoodie). I am still a bit conflicted about how to interpret this. Does it point to the thing David says to Ellie about ""you kill to survive and I kill to survive, how are we different?"" Is David a reflection of Ellie, and in killing him, staining his clothing red with blood, is she effectively killing her own innocence?

Anyway, I'm ultimately saying that I doubt this all this is a coincidence. Artists work for a long time on character models and I'm really interested in details they end up using.

Right when I walk in there is a huge sign that reads North Texas Quarantine Zone, and everything in the place is a wreck. Trash everywhere, tables flipped and blocking pathways, the whole nine yards. Not to mention she had the soundtrack being played on the PA system, making it even more intense. So there are a series of notes basically stating what has happened, where to go or where ""they"" went next. I hardly knew the layout, so it really gave the same feeling someone else would get in the world.

Near the end (when you reach the highway leading to the hospital), Elli is  talking about a dream she had where she is in a plane that's about to crash. And you also notice that she is kinda distant and silent the whole time.

Now if you read some bits about dream interpretation, you'll learn that being in a plane that's about to crash is usually associated with the fear of figuratively being knocked out of the sky and back to reality as well as losing something/someone.

On the way to the hospital, Elli realizes that she and Joel will have to part ways, gets upset about it and has this particular dream.

A big theme in the game is the concept of the few vs. the many, and Joel's choice at the end is that conflict pushed to the very extreme: save one girl, or save all of mankind (ignoring practical issues like the Firefly's ability to distribute the cure). At first I thought it was unfair for Ellie not to have a say in the matter, but really, the whole game has been about Joel and Ellie putting their needs ahead of others.

The Winter segment was perfectly timed to start sowing that seed of doubt in the player's mind. In the university, the enemy who reminds you that you've been killing his friends - and I'm sure it's no coincidence that he's one of the few enemies you're FORCED to listen to before you can kill them, not to mention that Ellie plays a big part in helping you kill him.

The cannibal scene near the end of Winter is very reminiscent of the surgery scene at the end of the game - for a start it's visually similar. Ellie is helpless, on a table, about to be cut up against her will. The cannibals are going to sacrifice her for the good of their group. But while Joel calls the shots in the hospital, in Winter it's Ellie who takes the initiative, escaping, drawing the enemies away from Joel (and killing a lot of them, depending on how you played - although there's some that you're unable to stealth past), and ultimately killing David.

So when the ending comes around, Ellie may have been unconscious the whole time but she has already made a very similar choice earlier on in the game. So while she tells Joel to swear he told the truth, I'm sure she knows what really went down, but is glad that she didn't have to be the one who made that choice.

The ending is a big reason this game has stuck with me for so long. It has done an amazing job of putting me in someone else's shoes, and justifying an action that I initially had great difficulty agreeing with. It's an easy decision to make if you're just detached from the characters, but the fact that I agree with Joel is a testament to the skill in which they crafted the game.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,spoiler,,True,t3_1hebcg,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hebcg/spoilers_parallels_between_the_ending_and_winter/,

I just finished it and I can definitely say that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. I can't remember the last time I was so emotionally invested in the fate of a set of characters. 
The story was equal parts hopeless and beautiful, epic and introspective, violent and tender. For me, it felt as well executed and as tight as a particularly good movie. 
I have no doubt that this is one my favourite games of all time, and one I'll come back to very regularly.

Some said the fireflies would probably kill her but not get the cure, some said they would abuse the cure and use it to fight the government, some said that even with the cure there's no way society would revert to how it was pre-apocalypse. 

But what you all have to understand is Joel didn't have time to consider all this. He didn't spend hours before the surgery trying to weigh the pros and cons. He knew Ellie was going to die, and that's about it. Well, that and how the Fireflies wouldn't let him see her probably put up a red flag. 

But what was really going on here was just Joel caring too much about Ellie to let her be killed by the Fireflies. He's risked his life at least twice to save her, (Once when Henry was threatening to shoot him if he tried to stop Sam, and once when he tried to revive her after she nearly drowned) which shows just how much he's willing to do to keep her safe. He didn't stop an evil group of rebels from taking over the world with a cure, he saved Ellie. That's all it was to him. And I think that's more important than whether the cure would work, or whether the Fireflies would abuse it.

Really the way I see the ending and why Joel acted the way he did is that he needed that second chance.  The last time he allowed people to act for the ""greater good,"" his daughter died in his arms.  There was no way he was about to allow that to happen again, and he fights through hell and high water to get to Ellie and save her life.  By bringing her to the town, he's given his second chance at a life with his daughter (even if she isn't his biological one.)  Seeing Ellie's knife in the windowsill of the main menu screen after beating the game gives some indication that they can put their weapons down and live a relatively normal life, which is everything they deserve after the hell they've both been through.  I was conflicted about the ending the first time I played it, and didn't really know how to feel about doing what many people (even myself at first) would consider the ""wrong thing.""  In retrospect, I can't blame Joel at all for doing what he did and lying to Ellie about it.  Like I saw someone else mention, parents lie to their children all the time and it's usually for the benefit of the child.  I can't look at myself and honestly say I would have acted differently, and honestly, I do believe Ellie wanted to be lied to in that moment.

Anyway, that's my two cents about the whole ""second chance"" thing.  What a game.

EDIT:  Upon a bit of further reflection, I think in addition to Joel wanting a second chance at a life with his daughter, he wanted a second chance at being a father.  I recall the birthday card that Sarah forgot to give him says something like ""you're never around"" in the first line.  I kind of got the impression during the prologue that Joel hadn't been the best dad (I know, I know, Sarah said in the same card he still manages to be the best dad ever somehow.)

1372221096.0,79,self.thelastofus,1h36m1,Ellie's Dream [FULL GAME SPOILERS],Socrates-Johnson,82,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1h36m1/ellies_dream_full_game_spoilers/,"Just finished my Survivor run yesterday, and something occurred to me as I was making my down the highway exit and Ellie told me about her dream. Interestingly enough, I missed the option for this conversation on my first play-through, so I got to experience it this time with the knowledge of what was to come. 

Ellie's dream basically consists of her being in an airplane that is going down. She heads into the cockpit to find that there is nobody piloting the plane, and so she realizes that she will have to land it herself. However, she isn't able to fly it, and so it crashes - though she wakes up just as it does so. 

To me, the airplane is a symbol for humanity. The virus, more specifically, with respect to the threat that it presents to the continuation of humanity, is represented by the plane's impending crash. This is pretty clearcut. What is more interesting is Ellie's attempt to save the plane from its fate, and her perseverance, even in the face of the realization that she is ill-equipped to handle such complex machinery. She is willing to take the risk of going down with the plane, in the hopes that she may somehow save the other passengers. This realization is in keeping with what we might expect from Ellie and her philosophy, especially given her speech at the end of the game, in which she more or less claims that she is still waiting for her chance to die for something (As Tess did for her, and as others have in the quest to save - or at least to preserve - humanity). 

But this illusory death - and her desire to die to save humanity - is ultimately a futile one, as we might be inclined to realize. 

She can't stop the plane from crashing, just as she is unable to stop the virus at the game's end. Some might argue with this statement and claim that she has the potential to do so, but that Joel has stifled it. In a literal sense, such a suggestion would be correct. However, this inability to save humanity, as with the inability to fly the plane, has less to do with outside interference or her literal ability to save humankind, and more to do with the inexperience of youth, and the impotence that comes with it. Ellie cannot save the plane because she is too young to be able to do so by herself. She has not lived enough to have learned how to fly a plane, just as her youth has left her bereft of the cognitive capacity to be able to make the decision to martyr herself. That she has ""never even been on a plane,"" is only further testament to this fact.

Joel's response to her confession, by which he states simply that ""dreams are weird,"" operates much more implicitly as a rejection of Ellie's proposed martyrdom, and will have literal ramifications in the next act, when he saves her from a death she might otherwise have consented to. Though he might have his own selfish reasons for keeping her alive, it is fairly evident that he doesn't believe she is yet capable of deciding for herself. And indeed, this idea of Ellie lacking the capacity to provide consent is repeated through the fact that, between losing consciousness after attempting to save Joel, and later being rescued by him, the Fireflies have prepped her for surgery (and death) without even letting her know, or giving her time to agree. 
 
It is apt that she should be sleeping, then, during the frantic moments at the game's end in which Joel finds her about to be operated on, and at which point her dream and her reality may finally come to be one. But Joel wakes her up from this sleep, and the impending crash of her death, just as she is woken up before the crash in her dream. It is possible that there is an irony here; waking up from her original dream might have meant the prolongation of humanity's ""plane ride,"" while waking up from what should have been her final dream might spell the inevitable crash of that plane. 

I contend, however, that this is not the case. The plane, in each of these scenarios, will keep flying, though it does so without a pilot for the time being. One day, when she is equipped to do so, Ellie will take the controls and fly it home. But that day is not today.

I've been skimming discussion forums and reddit to see what people thought about it and I'm somewhat surprised to see that a common interpretation seems to be ""Joel decided humanity wasn't worth saving besides Ellie"" or ""Joel gave up on humanity""

I would argue that Joel actually *chose humanity* by choosing Ellie over a potential vaccine. Ellie is a human being whose individual life and choice matters, and he chose to value her life and future over some nebulous ""cause"" or ""greater good"". Maybe you could argue it is just playing with words, but he essentially chose his own humanity over inhumanity. By which i mean he made the human choice, as opposed to the inhuman one - to walk away from that situation he would have had to bury the human instinct to protect people you love, the same instinct that he tried to kill for 20 years. And he chose not to do that again, he chose to be human.

I'm not saying that what Joel does isn't morally ambiguous, it obviously is very complicated and hard to swallow in many ways. But I just don't see his decision being motivated by such a narrow and hopeless view of ""humanity,"" quite the opposite really. Maybe he was being selfish in the moment but it was because he felt it wasn't worth it to sacrifice a child for an ideal. Ellie is a part of humanity too. She is humanity. She's the future, both for Joel and for the group they're going to join at the end of the game.

I also don't think the overall message the game wanted to send was just ""people suck"". You do meet many bad people doing bad things to each other throughout the game, but the game goes out of its way to give plenty of examples of human decency and even redemption. What is Ellie and Joel's relationship if not evidence of that?

Anyway I think it's pretty awesome that the ending can be so polarizing and I'm definitely open to different interpretations, this was just my gut reaction upon completing my first playthrough.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,spoiler,,True,t3_1j1e1s,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1j1e1s/spoilers_joel_didnt_give_up_on_humanity/,

I killed one of them with a shiv but the other one detects me and a small gunfight with this hunter happens while he takes cover behind one of the cars and so I do the same. There's no ammo, just two shotgun shells and he's too far away to make them count. No brick, bottles or any throwable object in reach either. Ellie spontaneously throws a bottle at his face and he stuns for a second (I remember this moment in particular because it was the first time she ever did this in the game and I never expected she would do anything because I was so focused on strategizing). I immediately comply with her action and then proceed to vault over the car hood and run towards the hunter and sucker punch his face to the ground.


When we're looking down at his face:

Ellie: ''Wooow did you see that? I got him right between his eyes!'' (This is contextual talking, it wasn't even a cutscene)

Joel: ''Yeah...right...just, remember to be more careful okay?''

Ellie: ''But still, that was pretty cool right?''

(More random contextual chatter while we move on walking to the next area)


She never repeats that dialogue or anything similar again.


I think one of the cornerstones of why this game is so great is how the characters randomly chat and interact with each other throughout in random moments.

1372273902.0,68,self.thelastofus,1h4kxd,[SPOILERS] A different look on the game,ck-pasta,78,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1h4kxd/spoilers_a_different_look_on_the_game/,"Many of us see the game as Joel escorting Ellie to keep her safe and he eventually grows to love her like she is his own daughter. Essentially, we look at the game as Joel saving Ellie. But I don't think of it like that.

Joel is no hero. Hell, he may not even be a protagonist. 

Imagine yourself as a hunter. You and your best friend surviving in the city with some guys who have the same viewpoints as you. Sure, you may not like having to kill other people, but you do what you do to survive. You always try to convince your friends to let a guy or a girl live so they can join your little clan, and you do your best to keep people alive. Now imagine hearing they all died. Just like that. By an old man and a little girl. No one ever got a good look at them, but they're dropping your friends like flies. Who is the bad guy in this situation?

Joel is by no means a good person. Even before the apocalypse started. He has good intentions, but when it comes to it he does what he has to do to survive. This is illustrated when they passed a family while in the car in the intro.

Joel is alive 20 years later because he knew where to place his morality from the get-go. And that was to throw it away. By the time the game starts, Joel has no problem killing dozens of men just to get what he wants. He's no better than the hunters, the ""government,"" or the Fireflies.

Then Ellie comes along. At first he's hesitant to get to know her, but after a while he trusts her. He finally cares about someone. By the end, he's more open to Ellie more than he was with Tess. He fought his way through that hospital because he had gained back his humanity. He wasn't going to let Ellie die because she was everything good in the world. What other person would sacrifice themselves for the slim chance of finding a vaccine to help save humanity? Joel knew that humanity didn't deserve to be save. Hell, humanity tried to kill him more times than the Infected.

Sure, Ellie didn't get to save all the world. But she got to save one person: Joel. People believe that Ellie wasn't given a choice, but she was. She had the choice of calling out Joel's lie, but she doesn't. She chose to save one man's humanity, rather than a world from infection. She gave him his humanity back, and I believe that it's enough for her to go on with his charade. She doesn't believe him, but I think that she's content. 

**tl:dr** - The game isn't about a man saving a 14-year-old girl. It's about a 14-year-old girl saving a man from the world.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,1372274336.0,spoiler,ellie,True,t3_1h4kxd,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1h4kxd/spoilers_a_different_look_on_the_game/,

I feel like I have been playing this game for an entire year, but I started it on Friday. It has been the most grueling experience I have ever endured in any kind of entertainment. I thought Snake had it bad in MGS4, but this has left me feeling broken.

The team at Naughty Dog have broken whatever limitation I thought existed between entertainment and emotion and I'm not really sure if I am okay with that right now. I know I will look back and appreciate the incredible journey they created for me, but ever since the end scene I can't stop crying. 

I don't feel like I was playing a game. With each struggle and success, I feel like it was me in the world, fighting to survive with hope as the only thing I had to hold on to -- hope and Ellie. Maybe I'm just a sucker for these kinds of stories, but I cried after the Prologue too. I was so impressed by it I had two of my friends come over and play the beginning just to see their reaction.

I don't really know what else to say. The same words keep floating in my head; grueling, broken, painful, draining. There it is. This game has absolutely drained me.

There are certain facts that need to be established before I go on.

* Joel was unconscious at most for a few hours before waking at the Fireflies hospital in Salt Lake City. It would be ridiculous to think that a thump on the head would keep him out for much longer than that and the fact that they arrive at the hospital in what appears to be early afternoon and depart at what appears to be evening supports this.  
* Marlene's journal states that her men asking for her permission to proceed with the surgery was purely a formality, and she didn't really have a choice but to agree to it as the potential for a vaccine was too important.  
* Ellie wakes in Joel's car after being taken from the hospital and asks what it is she's wearing, having been dressed in a surgical gown by the Fireflies, seemingly without any memory of what had transpired prior to being dragged unconscious from the water by Joel.

What does this all add up to? Any experimentation that the Fireflies performed on Ellie must have been cursory to the extreme prior to deciding that they needed to *remove Ellie's brain* and they never asked Ellie's permission to proceed with the operation or even informed her of the consequences. Ellie likely remained unconscious the entire time from the moment she and Joel arrived.

After performing what could've only been the most basic of tests, the Fireflies had already committed to killing the Golden Goose in their desperation to find a vaccine. This makes me feel like the Fireflies didn't truly appreciate her as anything more than a scientific curiosity--a means to an end--instead of as a little girl. Even if Marlene felt conflicted about it, she was still complicit in the murder of the girl she had practically raised on nothing more than the flimsiest of rationalizations and the hasty assumption that it was the only way.

To make matters worse, they were fully prepared to sacrifice an innocent little girl who had been through hell to reach them without even so much as the respect of giving her time to prepare or say her goodbyes. And while Marlene and the Fireflies would've had no way of knowing how closely Joel and Ellie had bonded in their time together, it's not incorrect to say that Joel had taken on the responsibility of her guardianship in the ~9 months since they had left Boston. What the Fireflies were doing was effectively no different than abducting a child from her guardian and performing fatal experiments on her without parental consent. Any way you look at it, that's monstrous.

But the real irony in the ending of The Last of Us is that the Fireflies brought their ultimate downfall on themselves. Everything that happened could've been avoided if they hadn't been so goddamn hasty. If they had simply waited a few hours for Ellie and Joel to wake, explained what needed to happen to both of them, gotten permission from Ellie (as Marlene even said, it's almost certainly what Ellie would've wanted if she had been given the choice) and let her and Joel say their goodbyes, they would've had their vaccine; or at least known one way or the other whether a vaccine was possible. Instead, they practically forced Joel's hand by not giving either of them a choice. Joel wasn't going to let them murder Ellie, and the only way for Ellie to give her consent was to stop the operation, which the Fireflies weren't going to let him do; going so far as to threaten to shoot him if he didn't walk out the door right then and there. Maybe it was malice, maybe it was greed or maybe it was simply desperation, but the simple fact is that the operation was unbelievably rushed. What would giving them one more day before deciding to end Ellie's life have cost them?

While it's almost certain that Ellie would've chosen to sacrifice herself for a possible vaccine, Joel was correct when he told Marlene that it wasn't *their* choice to make. It was Ellie's choice, and they never gave her the opportunity to make it. Ultimately, that's why my Joel walked out of that hospital without a single Firefly still drawing breath.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,spoiler,,True,t3_1gy7ca,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gy7ca/ending_spoilers_some_thoughts_on_the_fireflies/,

When Ellie mentions her Dream of flying a plane I first thought that it was cute, since it's a pretty normal dream to have.

But after knowing the ending, I think Ellies fear is related to the real situation.

**So. I'm on this big plane full of people. And Everyone is screaming and yelling 'cause the plane's going down. So I walk into the cockpit, open the door, but there's no pilot. I try to use the controls but... I obviously have no clue how to fly a plane. And before we crash I wake up.**

 
 * Humanity is the passengers of the plane. **Everyone is screaming and yelling** Fear. The emotion that haunts mankind currently.   
 * **There's no pilot** I'm not sure if that has anything to do with the amount of times they have been trying to find someone help them and it never happening.
 * The last part. My interpretation with this, is that Ellie is afraid that she won't be enough, that she can't save the world. She might fear something like the tests ending up in failure and no solution in sight. She's still trying even though the odds are impossibly high, like flying a plane without knowing how to.

I'm not good at these kind of posts, so sorry if I didn't express myself correctly.

Then I realized that, one, the removal of Ellie's brain would have accomplished nothing, and, two, letting Ellie die without her consent (which she never even implied) was immoral. At multiple points in the last chapter, the nature of Ellie's infection is explained to us. Marlene calls it a mutated form of the original, and the surgeon's log notes that all the signs of infection except the actual, crazy-runner-creating infection are apparent. Outside Ellie's body, the fungus grew normally, implying that Ellie was able to fight off the presumably weakened form of the infection. If the infection was as mutated as the evidence suggests, then removing Ellie's brain would've been pointless. The infection had to get to Ellie's brain through her bloodstream, so there must have been infection cells in her blood even months after her infection. Since a vaccine relies on the use of killed or mutated forms of a disease to provide immunity, then why would a simple blood sample not provide the fungal cells needed for a vaccine to be reverse-engineered? On to the second point. Ellie was never willing to die for a cure. In Pittsburgh, Joel and Ellie came across a group of civilians who had been shot to prevent infection from spreading, thus sacrificing the few to save the many. Ellie commented that the act was ""shitty."" She thus rejected the idea of killing the few to save the many. In Fall, she wondered if the tests at the hospital would hurt, implying that she had no expectation of having to die for a cure. She seemed to be under the impression that she would give some blood and maybe get an MRI and then leave. She wasn't consulted by the doctors before they decided to murder her, and I doubt she would have been allowed a choice. The Fireflies were the worst sort of scum. Anyone who would unnecessarily kill an innocent girl for the nebulous promise of a cure deserves no such cure. Joel was wrong to lie to Ellie, but he was right to save her. He had seen the worst of humanity, and decided that Ellie's life was worth their (doubtful) salvation.

Calls her ""Baby Girl"".... I FUCKING LOST IT AND AM TEARING UP NOW THINKING ABOUT IT!!! OMG what a fucking powerful moment. Then when the audio cuts out and you see Joel saying something to her and the look on her face of udder shock, sadness, anger and JOY from seeing Joel was unlike anything I have ever seen.

I played for about three hours and manually saved once due to the game autosaving frequently. Well around the third hour of playing I noticed it wouldn't allow me to manually save OR even exit to the main menu while paused (the selections in the menu were grayed out). So I figured okay, maybe I'm at a point in the game where I can't do either of those things. So I played on for a bit more. Paused it again to try and save or get out to the main menu so I can get some damn sleep. Alas, I still cannot exit. This time I notice that there are four alerts on the pause menu that tell me the game is autosaving when it is not. Clearly a mishap with the game so I restarted my game to see where I was - and boom - three hours back towards the beginning.

So just a friendly warning so nobody plays on even further than three hours and loses all of their progress - if you notice any the things I mentioned, just stop playing ASAP to not feel gutted after losing a large chunk of your progress. 

Hopefully this doesn't happen again and it gets sorted out quickly.

1373063727.0,64,self.thelastofus,1hptns,On the subject of David [spoilers],Possk,70,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hptns/on_the_subject_of_david_spoilers/,"Aight, so I've seen a lotta this going around and I feel as if I might as well throw my two cents in. I'm going to be coming from a lot of [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVmKnrjBMQ) video, so here it is in advance for context. This is a spoilery-spoil zone, so if you don't wanna know, me thinks you need to sit your ass down and play this clever lil game.

Basically, everyone's wondering if David was a hebephile. Not a pedophile since Ellie's fourteen, but it still gets everyone's nerves wracked just as much. My argument is that he was, at least when thrust into a world where common morality is in decay. I do not believe rape was on his agenda initially as everyone else seems to think, however. This is a world where animalistic instinct has taken over. As a trailer quaintly puts, you either hang on to your morals and die--or you do whatever it takes to survive. You've gotta remember that this isn't our world anymore, and societal ethics are practically nonexistent. Let's take a walk through David's shoes for a moment.

His authority as a leader is clearly waning. The further you get through Winter, the more the group becomes frustrated and angry with David's decisions. This is to the point where you overhear a few growling that after the hunt for Ellie's over it's time to hold a town meeting to boot David from power. Furthermore, as the game and Nolan in the interview suggest, women and children are dying off in their lil area. The winter's too cruel and too many are perishing. So, when Ellie comes along, a few things that David's desperate for can be answered.

In various social species, you can see that the leader will primarily establish its authority by display of ferocity and pack dominance. Having a mate and children as it were helps to strengthen this position. This has been exemplified throughout our own past centuries--kings longed for a male heir to ensure their power and lineage.  I don't believe David has the lineage aspect in mind, but the need to reestablish his authority has become absolute necessity. Having children would repopulate their area and bring further confidence to his position among the group members.

Ellie is clearly a survivor--she's intelligent, brave, and quick on her feet. She doesn't trust easy but she's loyal to allies (in various instances when you're fighting the infected, David will get trapped and you as Ellie need to save his ass or else game over) and adapts fast. Her smarts, strength of ability, and youth would technically make her an ideal 'mate'. Gross by our standards, yes. In their world, where animalistic urges have overcome societal morality, perhaps not. What matters is that David goes through hell to get her on their side, and only breaks when it's obvious Ellie abhors his nature and won't go down without a fight. ""You're a fucking animal""--incredibly perceptive words as David *has* become an animal. Going largely on instinctual needs and ignoring the old world's moral code, David has gone into pure survival mode. 

Notice how Ellie in general presents trouble for David, yet he continues to go to great lengths to 'get her on their side'. He further endangers his position as leader, but he realizes that if his bet pays off, the reward's well worth the risk. Many argue that David wanted to rape her purely on sexual lust, which I personally think's incorrect. Nolan says that he felt David didn't want to rape or do anything terrible to Ellie (at first--her pissing him off changes a lotta the playing field). This can have two meanings, depending on perspective. One holds that David simply wasn't interested in her that way and we players are putting too much thought into it. The other of the two lays in David's desire to 'convert' Ellie. Wanting to pull her over to their side despite everything she's putting him through (killing group members, endangering his leadership, etc.). If he were successful, this would not qualify as rape. Converting her and having her bear his children would not necessarily mean something terrible due to the conversion, at least in terms of their standards. In purely animal ideology, which David's most certainly adopted, it's logical. Getting together with the ideal mate and 'breeding' to continue the society--something we typically associate with social species outside of the human realm. 

And as alphas go, many want a companion to rely on. This is seen a great deal in wolf packs and wolves typically mate for life. You see David comment on this after fighting the infected--""we make a pretty good team"". Having an alpha male and female does a lot for a pack, and really establishes a sort of dominance and order. He has good reason to want Ellie around, even though we the players (and obviously Elllie) think it's screwy as all fuck. One of the men Joel tortures says that she's become David's 'new pet', which can mean a lotta things depending on how you look at it. It can either mean he's had other 'pets' before or that he's recently found a 'pet' to have around. I'm more inclined to agree with the latter, but I get why others lean towards the first meaning. Regardless, the notion remains the same. Alphas dominate and generally have the most children, giving further rise to the idea that David wants to re-establish this authority.

Throughout the arc, David continually thinks highly of Ellie's prowess and tries to win over her affections (i.e. hand touching and referring to her as special, complimenting her on her shooting abilities, giving her food and 'negotiating' with her in a way). Think of it as courting if you will, as gross as it sounds. Obviously, it doesn't work. As such, he resorts to the only other way he can establish dominance--violence. A show of ferocity and power, which explains the near deranged behavior he exhibits as he hunts Ellie down. The more he doesn't get his way, the angrier and crazed he gets. Likely he felt killing her and chopping her 'to tiny pieces' would have sufficed as it'd give everyone in the group their way, but she escapes--and David just explodes in fury. This explains the increasingly brutal ways he kills you if you fail to knive him properly as Ellie. Hitting and shooting her in the head--fairly straightforward, scary as it was to see. But then you get to the machete. Slashing and bashing her down. Stabbing her through the heart. By the last stage, David's quite literally hunting her. Getting on his hands and knees, sneaking up from behind. At one point he says ""run little rabbit, run"". It's pretty much a beast hunting its prey, and it's very obvious that he'll kill without mercy. By this point, there's no taunting or manipulation as a man would be expected in trying to lure another out. This brutal display of violence reflects what we already knew: David has become an animal. There is no sense of morality left. He's even fallen into the motions of an animal by being on all fours. 

Whether he was going to rape Ellie or not by the end is up to speculation, but I wouldn't put it past him. He's gotta show dominance, and rape's probably the most humiliating and disturbing show of such for the victim. It undermines their own humanity by making them unwillingly subservient to another's body, and David by now wants to overpower her by any means necessary. She's a fighter--so he wants to take that away from her. She ""has no idea what [he's] capable of"" in David's own words, and dominance will be achieved in the most awful of fashions.

I tend to see Joel and David as foil characters. Joel believes in luck and how ""it will run out"", while David thinks ""everything happens for a reason."" They both develop relationships with Ellie, and are good fighting partners. Joel has a very paternal, caring relationship with her as they've grown together on their journey after a rocky beginning. David has a much darker, much less human relationship with Ellie as it progresses after what seemed like a friendly beginning. Joel's the father in Ellie's life while David was intended to be the pursuer--one of sexual intent like you would a boyfriend of some sort. A very twisted, very creepy boyfriend that you'd kick outta your house and threaten to shoot on sight.

Anyways, I reckon my long spiel's finally over. Basically, I imagine David was very much interested in Ellie and the possibilities for the future in her (remember, throughout the game Ellie is a symbol of hope--for Joel, for humanity, etc.). Just like everything in the game, there's a lot more to his character than the simple 'black-white' morality. In a twisted, purely animal perspective, David's behavior is logical, even if we think it's disturbing. But as it progresses, any humanity left in David disappears altogether as he quite literally becomes an animal. He represents the darkest side of humanity and what it can become if left unchecked, and Ellie is noticeably changed as she realizes just what is possible in mankind.

His actions are being called out as selfish, impulsive and morally bankrupt. Namely, I refer to his decision to trade humanity's future  for Ellie's life and lie to her about it afterwards. 

Joel's supporters have proposed that the FF's cure effort was highly flawed and unlikely to succeed, and that Ellie's non-consent was morally unacceptable. While I agree with these folks and support their arguments completely, I feel these points are ancillary. They're not necessary, and somewhat sound like sour grapes.

All you have to do is consider the role of the father that Joel takes on.

The role is not a selfish one. It's also, most importantly, **unconditional**. As Joel made up his mind, I too started wondering why he was willing to toss aside any chance of developing a cure for humanity in order to save Ellie. But I have a 12 year old daughter, so I didn't have to wonder for very long.

I think the greatest significance of Sarah to the story may be that Joel doesn't have to become a father through Ellie. He already is a father. He already knows the role, having learned it the only way possible - through experience and activated instinct. Rather, he applies it to Ellie. He works very hard to resist doing so along the way, and ultimately you could argue that the **obligation** it brings - to protect her even the cost of saving humanity - is the price he pays for having given in.",,True,nsfw,t5_2t7gp,False,,,True,t3_1hvz9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hvz9g/because_fatherhood_spoiliers/,

Marlene had watched her entire army die. Marlene had withstood 20 years of being a rebel while in search of a cure or vaccine. If one is to read Marlene's diary then it is clear that this burden has weighed on her. Marlene was no longer searching for a cure or a vaccine.

[Spoilers]",PandaBearShenyu,77,19,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hh46e/i_think_i_found_an_alternate_ending_dont_get_too/,"Last night when going through the hospital in NG+, I had an epiphany. Most of the rhetoric about the ending relate to how Joel brutally murdered innocent people trying to save the world, even doctors. The way I played the ending completely negates that, both in how I approached the soldiers and the surgeon.

I snuck by all the soldiers and went through the hospital completely undetected. when it came to the stair soldier and end soldiers, I just threw a smoke bomb and beelined for the door to get past everything without killing a single person. The way I played it was actually WAY faster than killing everyone. I got through the whole thing in 3 minutes on survivor.

When I got into the operating room and I saw the surgeon pointing the scalpel at me, I pointed my gun at his head. Then I realized. You really don't have to kill him. So I shot him in the kneecap and he keeled over.

Now here is the real interesting part. The female doctor says ""no... you fucking animal."" She never says ""You KILLED him"". Personally to me, that says the doctor dying by Joel ISN'T CANON! The ambiguous dialogue could definitely mean ND left it open to your interpretation if you killed the doc or not. After all, they gave you infinite time to decide where you want to shoot him, but the game logic implanted in our heads say we have to shoot him in the head, some even killed all three docs! One more thing I noticed, [after I shot the doc in the kneecap, He didn't have the death blood pool, there was only the splatter of blood from me shooting his knee.](/spoiler)

This changes everything. Based on my assumptions. It's perfectly doable for you to save Ellie without killing any innocent people. Joel is also extremely pragmatic. His one goal is to save Ellie, the fastest and safest way get to her is by stealthing it and not killing anyone. To Joel, I think he understands if he dies, Ellie dies too so he'd definitely pick the stealth option. Of course you still kill Marlene and the soldier at the start; but she posed a direct threat to Ellie since she is the only one that knows Joel and Ellie.

1372556765.0,55,self.thelastofus,1hcbv2,"""I struggled for a long time with surviving."" Analyzing Joel's character. [SPOILERS]",thekidwiththefa,66,11,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hcbv2/i_struggled_for_a_long_time_with_surviving/,"So, after beating this game (which is definitely one of the greatest gaming experiences I've ever had), I've been doing a lot of thinking about the story, mainly Joel's character, which was stunningly well-written.

The ending leaves you with a pretty terrifying image of him: here's this guy who's terrified of having nothing to live for, and thus will do (and has done) monstrous things to give his life meaning and purpose. In some respects you could even call Joel an existential character, in the vein of Tony Soprano or Don Draper, which was surprising enough in itself since I very rarely see video game characters written like that.

The line in the title sums it up. He says it to Ellie near the end, ""I struggled for a long time with surviving. No matter what, you keep finding something to fight for."" This definitely reflects Joel's mindset at the end, but some things in the game make me think that this is how Joel's *always* been, even before he lost Sarah.

I went back and watched the prologue again, and some things about it made me draw this conclusion. The first time we see Joel he's talking to Tommy about how he can't lose his job, and the desperation in his voice is apparent. There are multiple ways to interpret that line, but both of them get to the root of Joel's conflict. The practical interpretation, that if Joel loses his job he won't be able to support Sarah or have a roof over his head, and the existential one, that having responsibilities gives his life a purpose, both point to Joel as someone who feels a bit insecure or shaky about whether his life has value. As the rest of the game shows, he seems to judge it entirely by whether it has a clear purpose. It's not until he starts getting closer to Ellie and protecting her that he becomes more driven, more aggressive and ruthless. This seeming lack of value he places on his own life also seems to extend to everyone else's lives. Joel doesn't seem to place any value on life unless it fills some need for him (killing the doctors to save Ellie illustrates this perfectly). The game may even be saying that this is how we all are, deep down.

Another part of the prologue is Joel shooting their neighbor Jimmy, while Sarah watches. Her reaction is one of shock, in disbelief that her father shot someone who was seemingly a friend to them. This clues us in early on to Joel's dangerous side, that side that will kill to protect what he cares about.

The last part of the prologue is Joel carrying Sarah out of town after their truck crashes, which is mirrored in the ending with Joel fleeing the hospital carrying Ellie. The game is obviously drawing a parallel between Sarah and Ellie, since both are somebody Joel feels he needs to protect. We know from the ending that he needs to protect Ellie because he needs a reason to survive, and equating it to him rescuing Sarah implies that he felt this with her too.

I do want to clarify that I don't think Joel was at the same *level* of monstrosity at the beginning as he is at the end. Certainly the trauma of losing his daughter and living through hell for 20 years eroded a lot of his humanity, but I ultimately view him as a tragic character, and even a paradoxical one. He's someone who sacrifices his humanity in the process of trying to feel human, and even sadder, he seems to take Ellie with him.

1371602637.0,55,self.thelastofus,1gmg9f,[SPOILERS] [RANT] End of game,FunkMasterPope,76,21,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gmg9f/spoilers_rant_end_of_game/,"I keep seeing people saying that Ellie believes Joel at the end of the game. I see NO way that she believes him.

1. She wakes up in a car, in a hospital gown, Joel tells her to ""take it easy, the drugs are wearing off""

2. Joel doesn't have her clothes with her, her outfit is different in the final scene back to Tommy's city. (I'm away from my ps but I do need to check and see if the clothes change by season maybe. Just occurred to me that I should check her backpack as it would be more definitive on this point)

3. Why would they leave the fireflies without resting there *at all*? They just spent a year traveling across the country, why wouldn't they at least spend the night to rest in a safe secure area? Especially with Ellie in a poor condition, ""Oh, you don't need her? Well I'll just throw this unconscious girl in the back of a car and be on my way then!"" Unless they weren't on good terms with the fireflies?

4. Joel does a shitty job of lying to her in the car, while it's not a terribly shitty lie, he pauses and stutters during it

As we've seen throughout the game, Ellie is not stupid. There's no way that she hasn't taken all these things and come to the logical conclusion that the fireflies still wanted her.

The point of the last cutscene is that Ellie has survivor's guilt from everything that she's gone through and is asking Joel if they did the right thing by not sacrificing her to *maybe* get a cure. The chance of even getting a cure out of her is slim, hardly even a possiblity. She was in a makeshift operating room when Joel finds her. What happens if a cure is even possible from her? How do you manufacture? Distribute? Even get it out of the hospitial without it dying/decaying?

If she didn't suspect that she wasn't going to live before they got to the hospital, she definitely knows afterwards what happened. She asks him to swear because she wants him to affirm that they did the right thing. The whole point of Joel ""lying"" to her is that it's the two of them having one of the actual conversations that Joel has been shutting down the entire game. All game long Joel tells Ellie to shut up when she starts talking about her feelings, shutting down the conversation at the ranch, his ""we don't talk about the past"" rule. Ellie finally does tell a story about her past that Joel listens to, and then he swears the story about the Fireflies was true. Ellie knows Joel is lying, and Joel knows that she knows. It's his round about way of telling her that he cares about her and they made the right decision

I don't see any possible way that Ellie believes Joel for one second, if anyone has evidence to the contrary please let me know. I just hate seeing people miss what I currently see as the only obvious ending to an amazing game, and I feel that thinking that Ellie believes him is completely missing the point to the climax of the story that ND is very deliberately and obviously trying to tell

However, I feel a good clan with people who have mics and all know each other from one place would dominate the whole game.

And we believed it.  

We suspected that, in fact, it could be quite a bit better than those mediums, but we really didn't have an argument for that, or even an idea of what that would look like.

But here we are.  The Last of Us isn't just a good game, it's one of the best pieces of fiction ever made.  It's full glory is only available to those that play it, and for those that do, we get this TLoU depression.

In our zeal to hold up video games as an equal to movies and books and other forms of fiction, we never thought about how affecting a game like that could be.  A game that was more affecting then TV and books.

So here we are... with a game that affects the players emotionally a great deal more (and here's the important part) then any other piece of fiction ever.

We're in uncharted territory with this game, my friends.  And, I suspect things are going to be a bit different from here on out.

&gt;**You're not even a day old**, and holding you is the most incredible thing I've done in my life, a life that is about to get cut a little short.
&gt;
&gt;Marlene will look after you. There's no one in this world I trust more than her. When the time comes she'll tell you all about me. Don't give her too much of a hard time. Try not to be as stubborn as me.
&gt;
&gt;I'm not going to lie, this is a pretty messed up world. It won't be easy. The thing you always have to remember is that, ""life is worth living! Find your purpose and fight for it.""
&gt;
&gt;I see so much strength in you. I know you'll turn out to be the woman you're meant to be.
&gt;
&gt;Forever... Your loving mother,
&gt;
&gt;Anna
&gt;
&gt;Make me proud, Ellie!


The note is also covered in blood.  

My theory is that Anna was pregnant with Ellie when she became infected, and then gave birth in the short window before she turned/died.

The unique circumstances of her birth would explain why she is the only human (we know of) that is immune to the cordyceps.

Thoughts?

As Joel explains his plans for them after everything is over, Ellie seems uninterested and melancholic. Joel just assumes that they will have a future together after they meet with the Fireflies. He does not ask her what she wants. 

I think that this feeds into the ending of the game. As she stares at her scar, I think that she experiences severe guilt over being forced to give up her chance to save humanity. I believe that she saw right through Joel's hastily put together story about multiple people with immunity. I think that when she says, ""Okay,"" that is her acceptance of the call to fill the void in Joel's life. She does not necessarily want to spend her life with Joel, but she has realized how much she now means to him. She knows that she has taken Sarah's place, and without her Joel's world would crumble. In this way I think she becomes a secondary martyr. Not a martyr which saves the world, but one which saves Joel.",,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,,joel2,True,t3_1gyfw1,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gyfw1/ellies_realization_spoilers/,

Fungal bodies are basically going to be pretty damn genetically similar, so the spores in her blood stream would have worked fine, and beyond that they said that her immunization is because of some mutation in her infection that caused it to have no affect on the personality of the host.

Here's the problem (and, honestly, this is just me being pedantic, I am completely on board with ignoring this issue in order to create the amazing ending they did), either her infection proceeded down a different route because of something to do with Ellie's biology OR it proceeded due to the mutation of the spores that infected her.  If it's the former, then biopsying her brain will tell them next to nothing about creating a vaccine and if it's the latter, then the vaccine is literally swimming in her blood stream and the 'creation' involves a blood draw and an array of fungal cultures..or shit, just have Ellie bite people.

The only thing that punches a hole in this is that I'm thinking there was a recording where one of the docs mentioned that her blood grows normal cordyceps fungal bodies in culture...but again, that goes back to the first bit, that this is something unique with Ellie.

I don't know.  I just finished it, I love this game and this is nagging at me.  

Side note, I'm completely on board with Naughty Dog going ""well...ok this is a problem with realism vs story telling, but fuck realism because we're taking the player on an emotional roller coaster of an ending.""

So I live near this old abandoned hospital complex called, ""Henryton"" in Maryland. Several friends of mine have explored there, but I never got around to doing it. The complex is pretty big, almost like a miniature town. I recently found out that it was to be demolished this year and so I wanted to go see it before the demolition. 

And ever since TLOU has been released...the game makes this place 100 times as scary lol. This place, in my opinion, has TLOU written all over it. I could definitely see Joel and Ellie walking through the woods and then coming across this place in the game. And it would probably be clicker or hunter infested. If I get around to going, hopefully I don't run into any bloaters lol.

While going through various threads I've noticed numerous people don't understand things like what is a stalker, how do stalkers differentiate from runners/clickers, can bloaters see, etc.
***
**Pre-Stage 1:**

Any living human that is infected yet still in control of there brain is considered pre-stage 1. This occurs after a living human intakes the cordyceps fungus through inhaling spores or bodily fluid exchange, but before the cordyceps reaches the brain of said human. They can infect others and can breathe in spores without much further consequence, however this may reduce the time it takes to reach stage 1 of infection. An extremely rare mutation of the cordyceps will cause an infected human to never get past pre-stage 1, seen in main character Ellie. Infected humans are in pre-stage 1 from the point of infection until 1-2 days in.
***
**Stage 1:**

Stage one starts the moment the cordyceps takes over the infected humans brain. Referred to by survivors as runners, stage 1 infected are very quick and tend to attack in groups. Runners tend have very twitchy and jerky movement. Runners have no outer fungal growths, however they have poor eyesight due to the fungus targeting the eyes first. Infected humans are on average in stage 1 from day 1 until anywhere from week 1 to 1 year of infection.
***
**Stage 2:**

Stage 2 of infection, known by survivors as stalkers, begins when the body completely stops trying to resist the cordyceps. It can last anywhere from week one until year one of infection. Stalkers have fungal growths coming out of their heads, but not enough to harm there senses anymore than that of a runner. Stalkers are far more intelligent than runners, and have a very keen sense of their surroundings. Stalkers will attempt to hide behind cover and ambush survivors. When running from place to place they will strafe. Stalkers are slightly stronger than runners.
***
**Stage 3:**

Stage 3 of infection begins the moment that an infected human's fungal growths disable its eyesight, causing it to rely on echolocation to find living humans to spread the fungus to. Referred to by survivors as clickers, stage 3 of infection can last from 1 year of infection to around 15 or so years of infection. Clickers have no eyesight, however their echolocation provides them with the ability to still sense where a human might be. Provoked clickers will rapidly flail their arms while walking towards the area where they last heard the human. Clickers are slower than runners, however they are stronger. The fungal growths on a clicker's face can act as weak armor.
***
**Stage 4:**

Stage 4 begins when an infected human's fungal growths reach all parts of it's body. Referred to by survivors as bloaters, infected humans in stage 4 have most like been infected for at least 10 years. Extremely overgrown fungus all over the bloater acts as a very strong armor. Like clickers, bloaters use echolocation to find potential hosts, however their echolocation is far worse compared to clickers. Bloaters throw balls of spores from their own body at their targets. They are extremely strong, however their speed is much worse than previous stage of infection. Fire can burn through a bloaters fungal armor, making it more vulnerable.
***
**Post-Death:**

When the fungus decides that the infected human is no longer capable of efficiently spreading the infection through body fluid exchange; due to high body damage (which can be caused by the fungus itself), being trapped, etc; it will kill off the human in a secluded area, where it will then proceed with releasing infectious spores into the air, so that any human that enters said area without protection (usually via gas mask) will be infected. Infected that have been killed by any means other than the fungus doing it itself will not release spores into the air.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,1375833833.0,spoiler,,True,t3_1jts37,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1jts37/stages_of_infection_possible_spoilers/,
1374968687.0,49,self.thelastofus,1j6s8a,Survivor Tips and Tricks compendium [Spoilers],Beignet,50,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1j6s8a/survivor_tips_and_tricks_compendium_spoilers/,"I just completed a survivor run, which turned out to be easier than I thought, and I've got a collection of tips and tricks and misc. that might help out whoever is doing the same thing. I love making strategies on how exactly to do a certain area. This will be updated as I do my survivor+ run, and feel free to add your own. 

**GENERAL**

- Stealthing will be very important both because it's a resource-less way to kill, and sometimes, you just can't afford to fight. Surefire way to sneak: move while aiming. Better done with a projectile weapon so you still have the 3rd person view. 

- Stretch out your melee weapons by preceeding with bottle or brick stun. If it stuns, you have a chance to do a one-hit kill.

- You can sneak up on most moving human enemies with your default speed (standing, no L2). 

- A health upgrade (with the pills) is a free heal, so upgrade at the opportune time. 

- On that note, don't bother upgrading crafting speed or shiv master. Better to not get into situations where you need to craft in battle, and don't let a clicker get you. One healing speed upgrade might be worth it. No weapon sway is amazing, and in my opinion trumps a health upgrade. 

- Don't be in a hurry to heal if you find yourself low after just finishing a fight. Ellie and your companions will give you health packs if you don't have any, there could be small heath packs around, and some story progressions come with a free heal. 

- There are at least 3 fully made shivs that you can pick up. 1)  DO NOT MISS THESE. On route to Robert, before you open the gate to the docks. It is upstairs. 2) On route to Robert, after you open the gate, and you at the docks with a ton of people. It's on one of the boxes. 3) Downtown, in the area with the clickers after you come across the Fireflies and your first Molotov. It's in a locker immediately to your left.

- You can safely move a human enemy that you snuck up on (but haven't killed yet). I will usually move them behind cover, so the body isn't out in the open for patrols to see.  

- General runner strategy: an area full of runners isn't too bad. All the areas where you'll be overwhelmed by runners are rather large, so make circles, picking up bottles and bricks, throw them, and pick them off one by one this way. 

- Regarding weapon upgrades, you want upgrades that help you produce move damage output. Reload speed and second holsters are at the top of my list. 

- Take advantage of companion invincibility, and let them do as much of the fighting as possible. They do less damage, but I think at the risk of damage to yourself, it's far safer. 

- Shiv doors. You can skip the first one, there is 25 parts and 10 pills if you'd like to use it on a clicker that you feel you just can't get past. It seems like the game will give you just enough parts to make just enough shivs to open all of them. If you'd like some extras you're just going to have to give up some doors. You can always restart an encounter if you feel you can do without what you found. Some are pretty essential though, such as the one in the winter chapter, where there is a manual inside. Also, that being said, never make nail bombs. 

- Hunters that use molotovs all wear the same red jacket for some strange reason. On survivor, I've found their drop rate of items is pretty fantastic, so always kill these guys. 

- When sneaking through an area, the last person Joel kills is always a non-stealth kill, so if you see that, you can take a breather. 

- If you are within sights or just in the vicinity of a human enemy, the game gives you a tonal cue. I can't describe it, you can test for yourself, it'll be unmistakable afterwards. This is your cue to take cover before they realize what they've seen. If you are far enough, they won't take action. The game gives you a different cue if you've been seen, usually in the form of bullets or runners. 

- A stunned enemy stays stunned for about 5 seconds. 
 
- Enemy routes are constant unless you disturb them, either by making noise, letting them see you, etc. Use this to formulate your own strategies and routes. 

- Joel will easily win in fisticuffs against a runner or stalker, but if you both attack at the same time, there's no telling whose hit animation has priority. To conserve precious health, better to wait for the runner to make his move, whilst moving backwards or to the side, and follow up.

**AREA SPECIFIC**

- Downtown, after your first clicker encounter, do not heal after Tess tells you to. In your next clicker encounter, there are two small health packs, and you can also practice killing lone clickers with bricks.  

- Downtown, first area you have to fight alone. There are 4 runners and a clicker. Here's a relatively safe method if you're not very good at sneaking yet, since you have to do it absurdly slow. The one that is standing still by the block is a free kill. That's one. Take cover where he is after you've killed him, and kill the clicker with the revolver. That's two. It'll take 4 body shots or 2 head shots, but that's harder with weapon sway. Empty the rest into the next runner that comes at you, stun with a brick and switch guns if you go empty. That's three. It's just runners (two more) left, so make circles and pick them off. Don't forget the revolver ammo by the guard in the upper area. 

- Downtown, underground with the clickers. There's a shiv to your left where you start, don't miss it. It's a bitch to sneak in this part, especially if you want the safe. It's just parts but I think it's well worth it. If not, cut through the middle, and make your way to where you have to pull the ladder down. Don't waste a shiv on the clicker, keep a bottle with you. Here's a tricky part, if you throw it too far away you might not wake it up, but if you throw it too close you can't clear enough time to pull down the ladder. Throw the bottle just far enough to wake it up, and throw something else to distract it even further away. 

- Museum fight: Where you come up on Tess fighting off the runner, stay in that area, it's a great bottleneck. Occasionally shoot a bullet or two, but try to let Tess handle most of it. 

- On route to Bill, before the gate that you boost Ellie over, is a shed with a clicker in it. He's guarding a rag. I'm a hoarder so I can't leave it behind. Get the shiv door in the area, and boost Ellie over, before attempting to get it. Throw a brick to get it out of the shed, and get in and get out.  

- On route to Bill, there's a door with an infected banging on it on the other side, go in (despite Ellie's protests) and bring a bottle with you. It's a lone runner, and to make sure you don't waste the shiny new upgraded melee you find, use a bottle and press triangle to grab it instead. There's some pills here. 

- Making your way to the school, right after you open the garage door. As soon as you cross the opening between the two busses, you'll trigger a fight. I had no idea this was scripted, I always assumed I did something wrong, but just be prepared for this. After you over the bus where you have to boost Ellie up to get the ladder, immediately make for the window. Waiting for Bill to open it risks damage. 

- First bloater fight: a lot of people seem to have problem with this. Waste the two runners that come up at you on the left with the shotgun, and the rest is just strafe and shoot with whatever you have. Try to aim for a consistent place, and not at the head. It's just a harder target. Save your molotov(s) and/or nail bombs if you've got them, I think this is just too easy of a fight to waste them. They're better served at the basement hotel (if that) to help you make your getaway. 

- Hotel basement. Immediately make your way to the office, to pick up the keycard. I found out on my survivor run that this is NOT the only other trigger for the stalkers beside the generator. They'll actually follow you through the top level if you go up there quickly enough. So pick up the keycard and turn around so there's no surprises. You might have to look away briefly to get them to jump you. Keep your aim at the doorway and tilt slowly and turn as soon as you see them. Then, turn on the generator and run like hell. 

- Financial district, the first fight where Ellie is assisting you up top with the rifle. There are actually two waves. You'll know you're at the end of the first one if you've snuck perfectly, then Joel does the last one without stealth. Enemies in the second wave will be alerted to your presence. Take cover behind the two trucks, near the gate where you'll progress, because enemies are more likely to come through the bottleneck, and not up top. Try to have some notion of the number left, and make sure you pick up any ammo, arrows, or items as a result of the fight, because the bodies clear after the cutscene, along with all the goodies. 

- University, escape. Unless you just can't avoid it, don't heal. You start with the same amount of health (3 bars or so) as soon as you gain control of Joel in the winter chapter. 

- Ellie's section, fight 1/2. I think this is the harder of the two major fights, because of the lack of space and uncertainty of ammo. If you can, try to kill them inside - can't get ammo drops if they're outside. If you get hit in the first wave, restart, but if you get hit in the second wave, just let them kill you (as morbid as that sounds), because a restart will set you back to the beginning. The waves are marked by David blocking off the left set of windows. In the hallway right after that section, STAY TO THE LEFT. Runners will break the windows on the right and you could lose health. 

- Ellie's section, intermediate section. Get to know the clicker's pattern. One makes circles. Wait until that one is out of side to sneak towards the left where you can drop down. Distract the one that is by the ladder with a brick so you can climb up. In the upper area that David boosts you to, be sure to pick up a brick to stun the clicker that's in the room. 

- Ellie's section, fight 2/2. DO NOT immediately activate the speech prompt on the bodies, as this will speed up the arrival of the first wave. Collect everything you can. The first to arrive is three runners and two clickers. Make sure you kill them when they're closer so you don't have to go as far if they drop ammo. If you haven't used an arrow yet, use a single one, as there is one arrow on the table in the upper level. If you are having trouble with the runners, they drop from the windows above, so pick one and place a nail bomb under. Cycle through each of the rest, and make circles around the area if you get overwhelmed. If you were saving a molotov for the bloater, wait for it to drop down to the main level, so that you can hope to get one or two more kills via splash damage. 

- Ellie's section, drawing the hunters away from Joel. Don't be stingy about ammo or item usage, as you'll lose them all anyway. You should still have almost all of your arrows, which is just about enough to take out everyone in the area immediately after falling off Callus (R.I.P).

- David fight. I was seriously not looking forward to this, and I think I got a bit lucky, but I think I figured something out. The first two hits are trivial, you can get them within 10-15 seconds of each other if you wanted. The third is a bitch. Just try your best to not get seen, and move slowly, all you want to know is where he is. I can't confirm it yet, but if you see the direction he takes to move to new cover, he doesn't look behind him once he settles, so that's your way in. It's worked well on hard, hard+, and my recent survivor run.

- Salt Lake City, tunnel. If you're having trouble sneaking, and you haven't made use of the flamethrower, that would be the weapon of choice in this section. There is another ammo cartrige between the first and second section, and the first bloater also drops ammo for it.  

- Firefly lab. If you've been diligent about your ammo and item usage you can absolutely waste everyone here. If you really want to sneak I'll defer to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMQDcAUSMMc. Credit to the maker of the video.

What just occurred to me is that this situation is repeated again at the end: he goes to the Fireflys, with surrogate daughter in hand, expecting to find an authority group that will at the least be protective of them, and at best provide a sort of salvation. He once again puts his trust in an authoritarian group, only to have the trust betrayed in the worst possible way: they attempt to kill his adopted daughter.

If he was already distrustful of people after Sarah's death, I can only imagine how he is going to be after what happened to him and Ellie with the Fireflys.

Hi everyone, I know that a LOT of people have already made posts with their interpretations of Joels decision at the end of the game, but here's mine anyway! I apologise in advance for my disjointed ramblings!

It is all too easy to say that Joel sees   Ellie as a replacement daughter, and this is why he saved her. But I think that this answer does an incredible injustice to Joel and his apparent morality. It is an over simplified way of looking the complexity of the situation. 
I have heard it said that Joel doesn't think that mankind is worth saving, but I think that by the end, Joel feels the opposite way. When we start as Joel after the 20 year gap, he is obviously still suffering with Sarah's loss, and emotionally redundant to the world. But as he spends more time with Ellie, he finds his compassion for humanity through her. The way I see it, Joel did what he did because he believes that the people that would be saved through Ellie's death would not be worthy of such sacrifice, whereas the person dying (Ellie) is the kind of person that the future needs for the human race to amend and prosper. There is also the fact that Joel has reason to distrust collectives of people: whether they be hunters, the Fireflies, the military, or the infected. In his experience, collectives are brutal, oppressive, and above all, they only care about the other people within their own collectives. 
So, instead, Joel has learnt to put his faith in individuals, like Tess or Bill, and to a greater extent, to Ellie and to himself. I really believe that Joel feels that by saving Ellie, in a small way, he is still saving the world. A slither of light in the darkness still shines brightly. 
I also think that the lie at the end that he tells her about the Fireflies is said for her own sake. Ellie grew up with the people in this organisation, and with Marlene as a surrogate mother, so imagine the heartache that Ellie would feel if Joel told her that the only people that she thought she could trust in the world had tried to kill her. This is why I think Joel lied to her, to keep her hope and faith in humanity intact. But I also think that Ellie was implicit in this lie. The very reason that she asks it is to hear the 'correct' answer. Her question is already leading him to swear the truth before asking him which truths to swear. 
So to surmise my statement, I personally don't think Joel is the bad guy in this story, for there is no right or wrong in a world with moral indifferences right at the forefront of survival.

While both are linear and scripted, Uncharted is much more so, with very narrow pathways and not many chances for alternate approaches to a scenario. So assuming ND continues with Uncharted into PS4, how do you think The Last of Us will affect their future titles? TLOU is obviously a much darker game, with blood and gore and all of that good stuff, while Uncharted has always been a relatively low-violence T-rated shooter. Not to mention a whole slew of new gameplay features and mechanics, and once again an excellent story with a great array of characters. 

Personally, I would love to see so much of their work on TLOU implemented into future Uncharted games. Better stealth and less linearity go hand in hand, and that's the main feature of TLOU that would work wonders. Less bullet sponges enemies would be nice too, as it became a bit boring and annoying in my brief replay of UC2. I'd also like to see enemies who actually give a shit about their lives. The enemies in UC don't seem to worry about staying in cover and barely make an effort to dodge bullets and grenades. But in TLOU, they are smart and stay behind cover and conserve ammo. I want enemies that are smart, not tough because they take 10 shots to kill.

Some backstory first:
I've been counting the days since The Last of Us was first announced. I got this masterpiece about 2 weeks ago and I loved every second of it. But one thing bothered me. The first E3 demo kind of gave me the feeling that killing an enemy AI would feel weighty (in the emotional sense). My first play through was on Hard, and I knew in advance that playing it like Uncharted would screw you. So I did as the game implied. Stealth is a pragmatic choice. You don't say ""Hey, let me destroy all these dudes in the library, and then I'll stealth the Hotel."" I was perplexed at how caught up I was on Joel and Ellie that I forgot about the hunters and bandits. And by then, killing a hunter or bandit was like winning a game of chess. I felt happy going on slaughter fests on these guys (stealthily though).

Then on my third play through on Survivor +........ something special happened.

So, I reached the area infront of the library. I killed everyone outside without hesitation. I got in (first floor library) and I heard two ""enemies"". So to me it was just protocol I sat there anticipating the moment I could strangle one of em. Seconds past, and then it happend.

One of them was what I called a ""Pyrotechnic enemy"" (the one's that hold Molotov's and are red) was talking about getting some power for there projector to watch a movie and it's been forever since that happened. The other ""enemy"" responded "" Ain't nobody got time for that!"" (something like that). They go there separate ways and I strangled the Pyrotechnic. That was the first ""enemy"" I ever felt bad for killing. It got to me, I felt terrible. All this guy wanted was to chill and watch a movie or two with his fellow bandits/hunters, and i killed him like he wasn't worth anything. That could of been me or could have been you the reader, just trying to live the life we could have lived if it wasn't for this godforsaken apocalypse. To me he wasn't that different from Ellie. 

So I went to the second floor, threw a smoke bomb, and then bolted straight outside. I had this moment afterwards in front of the hotel. I walked way back and I saw a poster, Ellie said "" Why is she so thin? "" I looked at the image of a model. Joel said ""For looks."" Ellie responds ""Thats dumb/stupid.""

That's when I knew the game was truly special. My moral goals were so confused. I just killed someone that could have been me (the player), and then Ellie proceeds to comment on how silly Joel's time (our current time) is. I was so intrigued on how life is, how it could be, and who can perish in a world like this. I walk around a bit pondering, and then Ellie says ""Why don't we lighten the mood a bit"". She gets out a joke book. Initially the jokes were really silly. The last one got to me. ""What did the mermaid where to school""......."" An algae bra!"". Joel, Ellie, and myself laugh simultaneously! I never had such a reassuring feeling in my gaming life ever. I really felt a true connection with them, just like friends, it took me 3 play throughs to realize this. This feeling is what I wanted for the past 2 and a half years! A feeling that was truly unique, that would catch me by surprise.

Then it hit me. This masterpiece simulated a real life situation. I felt terrible at what I did, and who I did it to, and then I'm reassured by a fictional character by a scripted scene I activated by coincidence. 

So many feels. I didn't need the ending to make me miss Joel and Ellie. All I needed was everything in between. Those small details like an ""enemy"" talking to a fellow ""enemy"", or Ellie getting a joke book, all synced together perfectly. 

Naughty Dog truly deserves to be praised for what they've done here.

Note: I say ""enemy"" in quotations cause I'm being sarcastic.
Sorry for such a long post. I really got into the mood. 
UPDATE: This post is in loving memory of Pyro-Movie-Man

I dislike that people keep saying things like it's ***""nothing new, it's been done before.""***

What did they expect the game to be? It's a third person stealth/shooter. If it was 1st person then people would complain about being another FPS game. 

When it comes to the Infected they aren't zombies. Stop calling them that. It isn't a zombie game. The concept of Cordyceps in a video game hasn't been done before. It's new, interesting, and way more realistic than zombies. People praise the typical zombie cliched game known as the Walking Dead but say this game isn't anything new. Personally, the Walking Dead isn't even on the same level as The Last of Us. It's just a typical zombie story game where everyone dies for cheap ""feels"". Woopty-doo.

I've also seen people complaining about Listen mode and the flamethrower.

Listen mode can easily be toggled on/off yet people still complain about it. People complain about the Flamethrower and say that it's OP. You don't even have to pick it up or use it. The Flamethrower ammo is pretty rare and runs out fast. 

Don't like it, don't use it.

This game brought many new things and did most everything right and it pisses me off to see people calling it a cliche.

Because of the 4th of July weekend, My cousin (14), aunt, and uncle were visiting my family in Minnesota from Colorado. Instead of playing board games and that sort of thing with them I went to my basement and continued my second play through, starting at the scene where you meet Sam and Henry. Anyways, my cousin came down stairs and started watching with me. Now, after a while I could tell he was very interested. He would ask questions and react to occurrences such as infected attacks. Well naturally, my aunt and uncle came to check on us, which by that time I had reached the sniper duel. 

But get this, they ended up watching me play, through summer, fall, and all the way to the start of winter. Eventually, it was pretty late and we had to go to bed, but my cousin said ""you better tell me when you're playing tomorrow so I can watch"". My aunt, after refusing to tell her how it ended, went online to see the ending (bad idea I know).

It simply amazes me how a game can catch the attention of people who are not even gamers (my uncle is an aerospace engineer and my aunt pretty much only watches soap operas and kardashian shows).

I'm not even halfway through, but I've already devised some strategies that I think will help people get through the somewhat difficult early encounters. Share you own tips!

(All of the below applies to Normal mode only)

- Bricks are your friends. You can both throw them as a distraction and bash someone's head in quickly. If you do this out of sight of other enemies it can be a stealth kill, as long as no one is close enough to hear.

- If you're carrying a brick or bottle you can toss it at an enemy by hitting R1 when a green circle appears over them. This will stun them temporarily, allowing you to close in for the kill. This even works on clickers, although you need to have a melee weapon equipped to actually kill them.

- Fire + Clickers = good. Best way to kill large groups of them is to get them in one place by throwing something else them lighting them up with a Molotov. The sound of the Molotov breaking will also draw nearby Clickers, who will run straight into the fire.

- While we're on the subject, if you throw a molotov in a narrow space like an alley the fire will sometimes form a line straight across it, effectively making a deadly barrier. Be careful though because I've had Runners manage to get through without going on fire. 

- You can reliably take out two Runners with a melee weapon, or a melee weapon and then fists when the weapon breaks. If you're fighting more than that, or two Runners and a Clicker, take out the third with a headshot and then let the two remaining come to you. Just make sure you get the first swing in or you might be in trouble.

- Pushing an enemy against an object in the middle of a four-hit melee kill will result in an instant death animation where Joel will bash the unfortunate victim's head in. This works with walls as well as horizontal surfaces and will dramatically shorten a fight. 

- This game has a high degree of weapon sway, which means that headshots are not nearly as easy to pull off or reliable as you may be used to from other games. Don't try to take out enemies from a distance with a pistol, it probably won't work. Also, some enemies can survive multiple gunshots to the head. The ""crown"" of fungus on a Clicker seems to act as a kind of armour, as on multiple occasions I've ended up just shooting off the fungus instead of of killing the Clicker.

- Save your upgrade parts for your weapons holsters first. These allow you to carry multiple weapons without needing to get into your backpack. Later on you'll encounter multiple powerful guns and you'll be kicking yourself if you have to leave one behind.

1371745142.0,41,self.thelastofus,1gqghn,Finally a zombie apocalypse where the infected are believably dangerous.,Ubergoober,50,9,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gqghn/finally_a_zombie_apocalypse_where_the_infected/,"Most games/movies/books about the zombie apocalypse don't have zombies that feel so dangerous that even an organized, well equipped military would have trouble dealing with them.  World War Z addressed this and had the humans win in the end.  28 Days Later infected seemed pretty dangerous due to speed and sheer virality, but since they could die like a normal person, I don't find it believable that the military wouldn't be able to handle them (This is also why I think 28 Weeks Later was so stupid and forced, everything had to go wrong).  Zombieland zombies (fast, die like normal people) would never lead to an apocalypse IMO.  Even The Walking Dead zombies wouldn't be able to completely destroy society as we know it.  If a bunch of normalish people could survive the apocalypse, some semblance of the govt/military would survive.  

This game is the first piece of post-apocalypse media that seemed completely believable.  The infected are tough, fast, and can infect by more than just bites.  THESE are the infected that could cripple society.  I'm glad the military and some form of order still exists as this would be the only way people would last 20 years after the outbreak.  I'm also glad that the infected are deadly enough to make the prospect of rebuilding society and re-settling overtaken areas seem impossible.  I always like learning about the bigger picture in these hypothetical situations (which is why I loved World War Z, read it if you haven't), and this provides the most compelling one while remaining deeply personal.

Kudos Naughty Dog, you never fail the highest expectations.

EDIT: I'm talking about World War Z the book.  The movie is completely different.  I have no idea how it ends.  Also the entire premise of WWZ is that people win, not really a spoiler. 

**TL;DR: The infected in TLoU are absolutely terrifying and provide the most believable cause of a full scale apocalypse and prevention of a return of human dominance.**

So the question I'm asking is how you would rate this game in order of what you consider the greatest game of all time. I finished it a couple day ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about the game since. I plan to start my second playthrough soon, and I honestly think it could be my all time favorite game. It will take me a while to form a final opinion, as I'm still riding the hype train, and have just finished the game. Naughty Dog has finally been able to blend story, visuals, gameplay, and mood in a way that no game has ever done before. I've never felt as attached to characters as much as Joel and Ellie, and I loved how the game wasn't afraid to make Joel a truly complex character. His original setup of being a conflicted character with a tragic backstory seems very cliche, but it is executed in a way that makes him different, as he is certainly not a hero, or even necessarily a good person. The gameplay really did make sure you needed to make every bullet count. Every kill was disturbing, and the violence was meaningful to show the true nature of the world. The ending too was incredible. I liked how it didn't opt for a mind blowing twist (I'm looking at you, Bioshock Infinite), but instead served to solidify the true nature of the characters and the desolate world. And the great music adds to the mood, while the visuals rival what we've seen from next gen consoles. I think The Last of Us will go down as the greatest game of the generation, if not one of the greatest game ever made.

The decayed and bleak atmosphere and state of the entire world just depresses me when I think about it too much.

I think about how usually when people die or when things and eras come to end, there is still a legacy or memory left behind, but the game depicts that much of everything has just been corroded away into oblivion in what feels like a few moments relative to the entirety of human history. Compare mourning a loved one at a proper grave to holding the unrecognizable ashes of human remains blowing away in the wind.

The destroyed ruins of a downtown city and the relatively intact remnants of a suburb are both almost frozen in time but are ever so slowly being blanketed in rust and mold. I cannot even perceive the thought of overgrowth returning all things to nature as beauty when the virtual end of invincible humankind came like an asteroid to the dinosaurs.

When I see how non-human life continued to flourish after humans, it's *kind of* comforting to know that the earth as a whole carries on, but it disturbs me that those who would be the last of us survived long enough to know what was lost and feel both the tragedy *and* the aftermath.

1372449640.0,43,self.thelastofus,1h9p7z,[Spoilers] Let's Talk about Joel's decision,CockasaurusRex32,52,9,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1h9p7z/spoilers_lets_talk_about_joels_decision/,"Okay, I'm sure this post has been made before.. but I continue to see this topic come up in other threads and I continue to see the same arguments whether Joel made ""The right"" decision.  So let's talk about it.

Now the decision we are discussing here is whether to give up Ellie and allow her to die in order to ""Save humanity"", or to take her and run.  Joel chose the latter and it seems like a lot of people struggle with accepting that.  I've discussed this topic personally in other threads and I may risk repeating myself here but here goes:

First, let's talk about facts.  The epidemic has eliminated a very large portion of the population.  It has also gone unchecked for over 20 years.  There is ""No exceptions"" rule in place where anyone who is found to have the infection is terminated immediately.  Nearly every quarantined zone has fallen and the few that remain are suffering from a supply shortage and a labor shortage (noted in the beginning of the game when several of the documents you find show evidence of the military drafting people to do labor outside of the walls).  The Fireflies are seen as a rebellion group and are being killed on sight by the military.  As a result, there are very few fireflies left.

Creating a cure:  Creating a vaccine for the virus/fungus with the state of the world they're in is nearly impossible.  I'm being generous saying ""nearly"", I feel.  Even with someone like Ellie to study, it's highly likely they lack not only the equipment, but experienced scientists.  The most important thing they seem to lack, however is Time.  The fireflies are the only ones left even trying to develop a cure at all.  More and more of them are dying every day.  They are running low on resources and according to some of Marlene's logs... fighting a bit among themselves out of frustration.  Developing a vaccine takes a lot of time, a lot of tests, a lot of resources.  

But, for the sake of argument.. let's say they manage to do it and because of the sacrifice of a young girl they were able to make a cure.  Then what?  There is no way the Fire Flies have resources to mass produce the vaccine for what's left of the survivors.  They also have no way to distribute it.  This means they would have to go back to the military and try and convince them that they both found a cure and the military should use what's left of it's failing resources to mass produce and distribute it.  With the bad blood between the two groups, I think it would be hard to come to such an agreement.  That also requires the Fire Flies to basically allow the military all control over the vaccine, meaning they give it to whoever the fuck they want.  This probably does not include the vast amounts of people living outside of the quarantine zones: IE Hunters.  Hunters seem to be in somewhat large numbers in most cities, especially larger cities.  They also seem to have a problem with military authority.  

But again, for the sake of argument… let’s say they did manage to mass produce and distribute the vaccine to the remaining population.  Again, then what?  The vaccine isn’t going to get rid of the clickers and infected that already exist.  And from my experience with them, they seem to be more interested in killing and eating you rather than just infecting you.  They also seem to be impervious to the passage of time… and possibly even growing stronger for it.  So you can’t exactly wait them out.  The military, already struggling with lack of supplies and resources, will eventually have to try and retake some ground… especially now that the population is hopefully increasing again.  But taking more ground requires the resources to 1) purge it of infected and 2) keep it safe.  And not just defend it from clickers, but the people as well.  Hungry citizens under martial law tend to revolt.  (You have seen this in the game too, in the city that Joel and Ellie meet Henry and Sam.  There are messages all over the walls from citizens revolting as well as dead military in the streets)

So as you can see, the task at hand is insurmountable.  And it all hinges on the possibility of developing a cure in the first place, something the scientists working within the fire flies aren’t very confident about. (As noted from their audio logs)

Let’s get back to Joel’s decision.  Even if Joel doesn’t know the full extent of what it would take to find a cure, I think he does know that it won’t solve all of their problems.  This is compounded by his distrust in pretty much everyone.  Joel also, despite his best efforts, has developed a deep bond with Ellie.  Throughout the majority of the game, Joel seems to view Ellie as a burden and pushes her away emotionally.  However, I personally think he pushes her away because he is afraid about caring for her.  It’s clear she reminds him of his daughter, whom he already lost.  He still struggles with her memory and with loss in general throughout the game.  By the end of the game, when he finally let’s his emotional wall down and allows Ellie in, I think he realizes that losing her would destroy him.  So while his choice may seem selfish, he stayed true towards his character: being a survivor.  

At the same time, a lot of people seem to be upset with him lying again to her when she asks him to promise her he isn’t lying to begin with.  I think this scene shows that Ellie is already pretty confident Joel has lied and I feel like it upsets people because he doesn’t fess up to it.  But I don’t think Ellie asked him that because she worried about him lying to her.  I feel the only reason Ellie went through the whole ordeal to get to the fire flies and possibly sacrifice herself for a cure was because she was suffering from abandonment issues.  She states multiple times that she feels like everyone she’s cared about her has left her in some way.  I feel like by the beginning of the game, she has given up on finding someone to care for her and actually stick around.  However, I think she is so willing to accept Joel’s lie because she feels like she’s finally found that person and it’s worth more to her than saving humanity.  She doesn’t need a grand quest to give meaning to her life anymore because now she has Joel and he gives meaning to her life.

This turned out to be a fairly long post.  Keep in mind, these are all my own opinions and I encourage everyone to share their own.

I told him he could because it's amazing and he'd be satisfied playing it.

fast forward 4 hours into the game, he comes into my room asking me why is it so hard (on normal mode...) to get past clickers. at first, it didn't strike me as hard because i hate clickers as well. so i go and watch him play and as he encounters the first batch of [clickers in the subway] (/spoiler), he literally runs to the middle and tries shooting every single one of them. he kills 1, but gets his shit shredded and looks at me and says, ""see dude, i can't get them.""

i look at him with disappointment and shock. i tell him that you can't go all gung-ho or rambo in this game or you will get yourself killed every single time. his next response was baffling and i wanted to punch myself; he says because of his great CoD skills, this game should be EASY for him....

i tell him how to play using stealth tactics and what i did to beat the game easily without dying too many times (he's died 87 times and counting in 13 hours of play currently) and he does for awhile, but every time he finds a pipe, bat, or some other melee weapon (excluding bricks and bottles) he always wants to beat everything with the melee weapons now and gets mad when herds of zombies or hunters catch him out in the open and kill him...

i apologize if this is rant is useless or inappropriate for this subreddit, but i just wanted to read other people's story if they've experienced something like this. i understand that not every game is for every person and not everybody plays the same, but the fact that he said his CoD mentality would help him beat this game easily really got to me as he died 10 times in less than half an hour as i sat next to him nearly face palming every single move he made.

I just wanted to ask, from other fans - Do you all believe Joel was evil or doing right by his own?  I was having this conversation in another thread, and, watching this podcast from IGN, as well as Rev3's podcast, I find that MANY people find Joel to be a ""bad guy"" and we are ""playing as the bad guy""... I do not know that I feel that way.

The more I think about it, the more an absolute HERO Joel is... The question mark is, she ABSOLUTELY should not be used as a sacrificial lamb for slaughter (as the Fireflies would do with her - she should be asked, at the least)... so the follow up question is, do you ASK someone into martyrdom, can you ASK someone to take that responsibility?  Is it even fair to ask that question to someone?


The humanity we experience in this game is a disgusting species, and, as she is looking at the giraffes.. Should we sacrifice someone to save this rotten lot?. I am happy to see some others didn't view Joel and Ellie's adventure as a totally psychotic episode of a madman and rather as someone who just asked themselves, in that situation.. ""do i save what good i know does exist, or make sure the evil i know exists lives on a bit longer?"" its not at all an insult to the species, just the version of it present in that time. Is there any going back? would using her as a guinea pig or a christ save anything? Is it even worth it to ask that question? My perspective is, Joel was absolutely justified in his rampage through the hospital, but its fascinating to see people experiencing those emotions of the final minutes of the game in their own way, but... I see a predominant amount of critics and media espousing him as Evil..

I just dont think I see it that way.   I think they leave Joel's motivations very, very open at the end. Ive heard some interpret him as a psychotic killer who basically lies to her to keep her as a trophy 'daughter'.... Personally, as I was running through the hospital and afterwards, my perspective of what Joel was thinking was that you cannot force or ask someone into martydom. That is an unfair burden to task any person with.

This may be a case of projection, forcing myself into the story - Im definitely willing to admit that, after seeing the Joel backlash in recent days.  I think the most interesting thing, of all the fantastic things in this game, is Naughty Dog left Joel's motivations somewhat shrouded in mystery.  He may be our main character, may be the character with damn near the most lines over this 15 hour long adventure, but, I think they leave him somewhat, fantastically, ambiguous.  I can definitely see where people who Joel to be evil are coming from, but thats not the way I interpreted this story (which makes it exciting so many people felt different ways)

Just wanted to see if anyone else on this subreddit wasnt hating on Joel, but was cheering him on, that final hour.

1371753602.0,41,self.thelastofus,1gqrxq,Multiplayer Tips,doug,47,6,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gqrxq/multiplayer_tips/,"I have been incredibly addicted to the multiplayer, and have also been playing with a few shitty teams who're only shitty because they don't understand how some of the elements work, so thought I'd write a few tips down:  
  
* Survivors with healthy/hungry/sick is just a fancy way of showing you your level. As long as you keep survivors through the day (1 week = 7 matches or ""days""), you pass onto the next one and so forth for a total of 12 weeks before getting to select another faction. The healthier your survivors are, the more rewards you get, but the rewards for survivors are purely cosmetical.

* Parts are things earned through what you do in a match and are accumulated toward earning new weapons and better survival skills. You don'y have to be good at killing people to earn parts; you can earn LOTS of parts simply by choosing the support class and healing others (although this is so goddamn easy I think they're probably going to patch this soon). You also earn parts by crafting things! So even if you don't *need* that medkit, craft it anyway and get some parts.

* SPEND YOUR GODDAMN PARTS. You do NOT lose them at the end of a match; everything you earn *and* spend is accumulated at the end of a match and distributed among your survivors. THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. Too many times have I seen someone running around without any ammo when they can just *open their backpack and BUY some.* Buy the armor, buy weapon upgrades! That's why they're there! These aren't permanent upgrades as you will lose them at the end of the match, but they're good for that match!  
  
* Mark your enemies! You earn parts, help your crew, and your finger is already on the right analog stick! Just press down!  
  
* YES your odds of survival are increased when you stick together, HOWEVER some people have a perk that hides themselves from enemy Hearing Mode. It defeats the entire purpose of them selecting that perk if they're being followed by teammates.   
  
* STOP RUNNING EVERYWHERE GODDAMN IT. Unless the match has just started or you know for a fact the enemy is on the other side of the map, I wouldn't run. You show up on enemy radar as a big red dot. There's a reason everyone's crouching around the place.

I know I probably missed some, but if anyone else has any they'd like to contribute, feel free to do so. There's also the fun element of how factions are only shown to you, and nobody else. Teams won't be the same between matches, it doesn't matter who's chosen Firefly and Hunters, they're mixed up and the result is shown to you disguised as the same faction. I also HIGHLY recommend the hilarity of connecting the game to Facebook. It doesn't post ANYTHING to your wall, and instead gives all of the survivors names from your Friends List. Your friends have no idea of any of the decisions you make (who to save, who to let die) and is just a bit of fun.",,False,self,t5_2t7gp,1371753810.0,,joel,True,t3_1gqrxq,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1gqrxq/multiplayer_tips/,

Anything. So the cure... I know it's been discussed, how realistic it would be, whether Joel actually condemned humanity to death etc. So here's my final thought about the cure. Nothing in the game was meant to be taken for granted. The hunters weren't just bad guys, they were people that went through shit. The fireflies were actually a lot more about self-preservation then they were for the overall good and so on. Why take the cure as a done deal? The rest of the game, and realistic consequences as well as just random things that happen in real life. In light of that, I don't consider Joel's decision one of morals, actually I don't consider it a decision. 

As soon as he found out that Ellie was gonna die, there was no decision making going on. He was going back for Ellie and that's that. Many have said that this choice also reflects Joel as a flawed individual, but I don't think it was purposefully done to that end. We all know Joel is flawed, heck we know every one is flawed. That's why I love this game so much, it goes even farther than showing flawed individuals. It goes farther than morality. It cuts into the purest form of emotion. The ending just happens, it had to happen. Fuck I love this game and I love Ellie and I love Joel... I think I'm overly attached.

It hit me today that this line is actually pretty significant, and speaks a lot to Joel's character. Here's why:

When Ellie is alone during the winter, she has the chance to kill David and the other guy right there and then. But, she decides not to, and escapes instead. This, of course, leads to A LOT more violence and ultimately a much worse end for everyone involved.

However, if Joel had been in the same situation, he'd probably of killed David immediately... and so a lot less people would've died overall and Ellie wouldn't have gone through the traumatic time that she did.

I guess my point is that even though a lot of people think of Joel as a psycho, ultimately his way of doing things are probably for the best in the world of TLoU, and its nice that Ellie (and presumably Tommy, ~20 years ago) have someone to protect them and who is willing to do ""bad"" things for the right reasons.",,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,,paw,True,t3_1hls5t,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hls5t/something_about_the_end_that_i_just_realised/,

Most people who have played the last of us enjoyed playing winter more than any other part of the game. This was largely because you finally get to play as Ellie. And before I go any further, it becomes clear in this chapter that she is a badass, and could probably handle herself physically if Joel had died (aside from not being able to swim).

However, what a lot of people seem to overlook is how she is still a 14 year old child. Yes, she has grown up in the apocalypse, and is extremely capable, she is still a kid. 

At the end of Fall (when Joel falls off the horse), the last thing you see is Ellie begging Joel to get up, asking Joel, ""tell me what to do. Get up Joel!"" We already know Joel is the only person she has left, and clearly views him as a father.

During winter, Ellie appeared to be somewhat smaller then she was before. It almost looked like she was around the age of 12 or 13, as opposed to 14 or 15. Even while proving how capable she is of surviving, they seem to be trying to make her appear more vulnerable. 

Ellie manages to kill David all by herself, in spite of David being stronger then her physically. Joel, who sees her as his daughter by this point, rushes in to the steakhouse to find her smashing David's face in with a machete. Ellie has broken down by this point, not even recognizing Joel untill she sees his face. Then she just looses and says, ""he tried to-"". She cries into Joel's shoulder. Joel leads her out of the burning building with his arm around her shoulder, holding her close to him.

In spite of being a complete badass, Ellie is still a child in many ways. She can take care of herself as much as Joel can (or almost as much anyways), but she would be as devistated by loosing Joel as Joel would be by loosing her. They would be lost without each other. They more or less gave up a part of themselves and placed it in each other. Joel gave some of his ability to survive to Ellie, while Ellie gave Joel some level of humanity that he lost when Sarah died in his arms 20 years ago.

If either one of them lost the other, they would be devistated. Joel would probably just kill himself, but Ellie would likely become a younger version of Joel. I'm not talking about Joel, the father who would give up anything to save his baby girl, I'm talking about the ruthless killer who murdered countless innocents over the past 20 years.

1374737716.0,37,self.thelastofus,1j0jvh,Why Joel will never tell Ellie the truth. [Ending spoilers],HikariOni,48,11,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1j0jvh/why_joel_will_never_tell_ellie_the_truth_ending/,"When talking about a sequel, I often see people speaking about the following scenario:

Joel dies, and just before/in a letter after his death, he confesses his lie to Ellie, and tells her what really happened. Ellie then goes on a search to find the remaining Fireflies in order to make a cure, because she doesn't have anything to lose anymore.

I think that, first, this is a horrible idea, and second it will never ever happen.

First reason why this won't happen, and also the most obvious: Neil Druckmann has said that the story with the Fireflies is over. They won't continue that. That should rule this option out completely from an out of game perspective.

Now for an in-game perspective, considering the characters.

Joel will never ever confess to Ellie. Ever. The reason for that is simple: he wants what every parent in the world wants: for their children to live a long and fulfilling life, and for them to be happy.

She could never be happy after hearing the truth, because all the guilt Joel took on his shoulders by lying to her would come back. By lying, Joel basically told her that she deserved to live, and that nobody should take that from her. He told her that she mattered, and that he wasn't going to leave her. He took the responsibility of her life, and, in a way, of mankind, by deciding that she should not die for a vaccine. But if he told her the truth, all that responsibility would come back to her, and she doesn't want that. For Joel, bearing this is easy, because he has no doubt that Ellie is more important than humanity. But Ellie still has this dilemma imposed to her by her guilt. 

He won't tell her the truth because he knows that if he does, Ellie will try to track the remaining Fireflies to make a cure, and he knows that she will knowingly accept to be killed for it. She is so selfless, too selfless for her own good, that she would do that. And she would also do it because of her survivor's guilt, that makes her feel like she owes it to the world, to the people who died from being infected. Joel doesn't want that. He wants her to live, because he knows she deserves it even if she may think that she doesn't.

Also, Joel doesn't think humanity deserves saving. There would never ever be any reason whatsoever that would make him tell Ellie something that would lead to her death for a cause he doesn't believe in. She shouldn't believe in that cause, either, after all she's been through. And I think, as /u/keftih has pointed out in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hk6c1/spoilers_mega_discussion_animal_symbolism_the/), that Ellie has indeed lost her faith in humanity, but that her guilt makes her still want to save it, just so it would be off her shoulders. Joel would never put all that weight back on her, because even though it's clear for him, he knows Ellie still feels very guilty and would die for that guilt to be taken off of her.

I've also seen people point out that Joel would feel guilty for killing the Fireflies and Marlene, so that would compel him to tell Ellie the truth.

To the people who think that, I say: you don't know Joel.

Joel is not just any person that would feel guilty about killing people. He is a hardened survivor. Killing to survive is part of his life. And if he hadn't killed all those people, he wouldn't have survived. He couldn't have survived without Ellie.

Besides, it never even occurred to him that what he did is considered to be 'bad' by some people. For him(and I also think so), he made the right decision, the decision every parent would've made without a second of hesitation. He wasn't going to let anyone, for any reason, kill his baby girl. Ever. There is not a shadow of a doubt in his mind that what he did was the right thing to do. Yes it may have been selfish. Yes it may have destroyed a chance for a vaccine to fight the infection. But all those things don't matter. All that matters is Ellie's life, and that was preserved. 

There is no question on that. His decision is made, and by swearing when Ellie asked him to, he committed to it. He is not going to go back and nullify this commitment. The lie is now the thing they live by, and that is for the best, because thanks to it, they can live a relatively peaceful and happy life.

Nothing could make him go back on his decision, because he (and I) believes that it was for the best. There is absolutely no way that he will give up on giving Ellie a long and fulfilling life like he couldn't do with Sarah.

No, not from Joel or Ellie, but from myself.

Playing through the game, I found myself getting tired of the combat. My head spun as I tried to sneak past people or infected, and I was all more than ready to give up.

The game did an amazing job at replicating what Joel would feel to the players. I was getting tired of surviving, I just wanted it to end. This all changed by the time I got to the dam. By then, I wasn't surviving. I was saving Ellie.

I was saving her from running off, I was saving her from the lunatics at the lakeside resort. I felt determined. 

Joel's quote ""No matter what... You keep finding something to fight for"" struck out the most at me at the end. 

Basically, you find something different to fight for the entire game. First, you fight for the guns. Then Tess dies and tells you to make sure you get Ellie to the Fireflies. This got me a bit motivated, but that wore out soon enough. By the time I was at the hydroelectric plant, I didn't want to play anymore.

1371582199.0,34,self.thelastofus,1glp2h,Why The Last of Us is Hype: Part 1 [Minor Spoilers],Songs_Of_Freedom,48,14,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1glp2h/why_the_last_of_us_is_hype_part_1_minor_spoilers/,"This is the first part of a series I’ll be posting on why and how The Last of Us is among the best video games ever made. Have a read! Part 1: The Overall picture. [Minor Spoilers]

So, The Last of Us. Almost anyone who's played it will have loved it to bits. But why is it so good? As part of a project I'm doing just for the fun of it, I'll be explaining why and how it's brilliant, looking at it as objectively as I can from every angle. I feel like I need to; a lot of talk has surrounded this game, with plenty of cries of 'overrated!' I just want to show people that it is not overrated. At all. 

The game is, to start off with, an incredible example of a balanced whole. The gameplay blends seamlessly into the cutscenes, and vice versa. And there are just enough of both of these, too; there was never a moment in the entire three playthroughs I’ve already completed where I got truly bored of the gameplay (as I did with Heavy Rain) or tired of cutscenes (as is the case with MGS4). 

Moments of intense action survival are contrasted brilliantly with calm and quiet segments of peaceful exploratory gameplay. For every dark and dank area in the game, there will be an equally bright and colourful one, as is the case in real life. While your first encounter with clickers is high-strung and frightening, riding around on horseback is serene and peaceful. This lends the game a brilliant duality; it is both exciting, like Bioshock Infinite or Devil May Cry, and yet it has elements of serenity equalling the soaring beauty of Journey or Limbo. 

There are also sections of this game that are completely isolated and serve as a brilliant device for keeping the player invested and focused. Joel hanging upside-down as the infected run screaming toward him is just one example of this – think of any other triple-A game. They would re-use that gimmick unashamedly in order to pad the run-time of the game. However, that particular trick is only used once in the entire game, as are other completely unique moments that I shall not mention in order to minimise spoilers. 

Joel and Ellie are two sides of the same coin; both survivors, but opposite in gender, age, and outlook. While Ellie is innocent (her love of comics and whistling is evidence of this) and carefree (something Henry picks up on by saying “She doesn’t seem bothered by... any of this,”) Joel is the complete opposite. He is very cynical; his reply of “how the hell would I know?” to Ellie’s hopeful question about two lovers only heard of through a note shows this. He also completely lacks innocence; the fact that he so casually tortures Robert and has clearly done similar things before shows this. Therefore these two characters are excellent foils for one another, and represent the duality of human nature. As a whole, they perfectly balance the game’s story between being hopeless and hopeful. More character analysis in later parts. 

 In the Ancient Greek world, balance was considered one of the ultimate goals of life as well as a true artistic achievement. I can say with certainty that Naughty Dog knew how to balance this experience perfectly. 

Naughty Dog’s understanding of how the PS3 works is key to their incredible success with The Last of Us. I only noticed halfway through the game, but there are no trophies awarded for passing pivotal moments in the story. This is a very wise design choice; given that most players won’t achieve the trophies that are present on their first playthrough, they experience the game without the interruption of a loud ‘Ding!’ and a notification. 

Naughty Dog has also with this game made one of the best examples of video games as an art form. The storytelling is on par with or better than the majority of movies I’ve seen, and comes close to the complexity and nuances seen in great works of literature. Many design choices show how carefully Naughty Dog thought this game through. For example, the fact that you play as Sarah in the beginning of the game and can explore the house to see why she’s such an amazing daughter makes her death all the more tragic. These little touches are in my opinion the equivalent of a master artist spending as much time as he or she deems necessary on even the tiniest of brush strokes in order to make a beautiful painting. 

Likewise, similarly to many great novels, a core theme in The Last of Us is change and the lack thereof. Just as Ellie is bitten but immune to infection, she is hurt but not ruined by the world in which the protagonists live. Coincidence? I think not. I’ll elaborate on this and talk Joel in later parts. 

The gameplay contributes to this as well. While Telltale’s The Walking Dead fixes the issue of what to do with gameplay by almost completely removing it, and Journey tells its beautiful story by gameplay alone, The Last of Us finds a perfect middle ground. Gameplay is brutal and visceral, and reflects the story: for example (Winter spoilers ahead) playing as Ellie alone in the snowstorm with minimal equipment and supplies mirrors perfectly how deserted and isolated she is when Joel is out of the picture, being grievously wounded. It is also an accurate depiction of Ellie’s emotional state at this point in the game; she is at her darkest moment, hounded by hunters and fearful that Joel might die. The incredibly severe weather is representative of this, as well as the chillingly isolating gameplay; note that there are no hints given in these sections, and there is no ally to give helpful tips. Ellie is alone and frightened in a painful world.

Part 2 coming soon, focusing in on the Gameplay.

I've seen a lot of questioning about Joel's actions during the last chapter and feeling like they were forced to do bad things.

But I myself didn't question anything. After I learned that Ellie was gonna die for the cure I was like ""AWWW HHEEEEELLLL NAWWW.""
Every soldier I killed was because I PERSONALLY wanted to kill every fucker in the hospital.

And then we come to the surgery room. I panic as I saw the shadows and thought they had already begun and I literally sream ""NO, ELLIE!""
I enter the room and see that they were still preparing. I kill the head doctor directly because I thought he was reaching for gun.
I was gonna kill the other doctors, but I had to reload and I saw that I could pick up Ellie.

""You fucking animal.""
I turn around in a split second and put a bullet right in the head of the girl doctor.
I was gonna kill the last doctor, but he told me to take Ellie and just leave, and I was fine with that.

It was not until Joel started lying too Ellie I started asking what I had really done. And I felt bad for the doctors and soldiers. I mean how would have anyone else reacted if some random smuggler starts killing everyone in the hospital?

But Marlene? Hell naww. She knew Ellie since she was born, but still think this is okay? I knew her for 12 hours and I was like ""Fuck no. Ain't happening""

However, Joel is not a hero. he saved Ellie because he needed her for his own selfish reasons, which was showcased by him lying to Ellie twice. Joel doesn't want Ellie to have the option of making the choice to sacrifice herself for the good of mankind because that would leave him with nothing to survive for... This is the character who I was controlling for almost the entire game; a character I cheered for and whose pain I felt when shot or punched, and after he did what he did, I was left feeling just as ashamed as I assumed he did. This is the type of risks that is rare to see not just in video games, but in modern entertainment in general.

1376473328.0,33,self.thelastofus,1kc83d,"Tips, Tactics, and Helpful Information: How do you survive Survivor Mode?",binauralshitsound,36,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1kc83d/tips_tactics_and_helpful_information_how_do_you/,"I just got done with my third playthrough, Survivor+, and am a much more capable player than I was on Normal. You adapt to and learn lot of stuff to get through Survivor, and I think everyone could benefit from a big thread of tips and tricks drawn from the compiled experiences of the subreddit. 

Best pieces of advice I can offer:

* In all the sections of the game where you're playing as Joel with Ellie's help, which is most of it, don't waste your resources on Med Kits. If you're low on health, and have none in your inventory as well as no materials to make them, Ellie will give you one at critical times. So make a ton of Molotovs. 

* Use ammo to get ammo. You'll find a lot more ammunition on corpses that you made in firefights than with stealth, so get into one every once in a while to stock up. 

* On Survivor, the infected can hear you so easily that you're usually better off just starting a balls-out battle. There are exceptions, but generally, they have the advantage on you if you're noticed, but you have an edge up on them if you open up with gunfire from afar. Especially in the Sewers with Sam, you'll just frustrate yourself trying to act Splinter Cell. Remember, they don't have guns. Generally, stealth is a much better tactic against normal human enemies. 

* Consolidate what you have in your inventory. Too many times I kept dying because I was locked into a certain tactic, or thought I was down to no other choice in whatever scenario. Then after the sixth or seventh death, I'd notice that I had the materials for a Smoke Bomb or a Nail Bomb the entire time, which is a massive help when well-placed. 

* Even when a fight seems hopeless, when you have little health, no ammo, an empty inventory, don't fall into that nasty gamer loop of frustrated deaths. Take a deep breath and try something else. Even if you're certain you can pull it off the way you've been failing, just try something else. This game is very good about giving you serious room to run different plays against its many scenarios. Use that freedom. I've pulled off shit in Survivor that I couldn't believe worked, things I was basically just trying because I was tired of seeing the same death so many times. No matter how dumb something might seem, it's better than what's been getting you killed for the past half-hour. 

* I don't want to promote metagaming, but this isn't an RPG, so metagame like a motherfucker. Especially on Survivor, try and remember what comes after the immediate fight. I wasted all my supplies near the end of Pittsburgh, things I could have really used in the Sewers. Most of the time you'll find that all you needed to get through that next batch of enemies is Joel's hands, and that the supplies you saved make all the difference later. Be utterly minimalistic whenever you can afford it. Using a bomb or a Molotov because you have an entertaining opportunity to won't help you when you really, really need one to get through an area. 

* Ellie is far from useless. This took me a while to really learn to utilize since I'm so used to useless NPCs, but she's reliable like no other NPC I've ever seen. If you see her about to do something, like throw a bottle/brick, or if she has a good position on an enemy for a Switchblade kill, work with it. She's killed enemies before while I was sitting there thinking about how to best approach them. Always take her into consideration when you have her, because she's a big, big help. 

* Your Shivs are more valuable than anything else on Survivor for the Shiv Doors. Even if you've already opened them all and aren't worried about the Trophy anymore, you will benefit from those supplies, and it hurts when you can't get to them. So if you can sneak past Clickers without Shiving any, or if you can beat them without stealth, do it. Think of them as keys to ammo caches that become useless or disappear when used as Shivs. 

* Sprinting around like a madman can form a tidy mob of infected behind you. In open enough areas, you can loop around and sprint-melee the straggler over and over until there are no more. This got me through a lot of Bill's town. Try firing off a couple shots to kill one or two, then start sprinting. This way you can melee most of them to death and they'll still drop ammo, so you'll come out with more than what you had going in. 

That's about all I can compile. I doubt any of it is unknown or original, but it should all be damn useful. Post your tactics and helpful bits of info.

In this scene, I remember David was on top of her while she was reaching for the blade, but It seemed that David was trying to choke her.

I just wanted to her your opinions, Do you think she was going to say ""...kill me"" or ""...rape me"" ?

If it is the latter, I really can't imagine what was going through Ellie's mind during this entire ordeal. I really had to set my controller down and take a break after that.

To those who 'watched' The Last of Us online instead of actually playing it...] (/spoiler),Nolantino,47,16,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hw0sc/spoilers_to_those_who_watched_the_last_of_us/,"...you did yourself a huge disservice. Off the top of my head, I could compare it to watching people get on a roller coaster from afar instead of actually getting on the ride. Then trying to relate to the people who just got off of the ride only finding that you cannot connect to the experience the same way they can.  This is mainly directed at those who I've seen on forums saying that the gameplay is boring and repetitive or that the story is predictable (although I find the story to be undeniably fantastic even if you are watching it online). Most of those people watched walkthroughs with some vlogger blabbering through the entire game. Those of us who have sat down and dedicated hours to this journey know that these complaints are ridiculous because we've struggled to stay alive in the game, we've felt those tense and sometimes terrifying moments of being caught by hunters or torn apart by bloaters. For the player, those intense and stressful moments of desperation help fuel our emotional investment in the story and its characters.

 I understand that people who don't own a PS3 that were interested in the game saw it on youtube because they had no other way, and that's fine. However, don't expect to have had the same experience as those who have played it because The Last of Us is a game that's mechanics should not be judged from a distant observer's perspective, but by actually playing the game yourself. This is true for most games, but The Last of Us in particular. I know I'd get bored of watching some guy throw bricks and bottles around while hiding behind cover for 10 hours, but when you're the one crouch walking away from clickers in pitch darkness, it's a totally different experience.

The best examples of this are moments when you, as Joel, are going after Ellie during the Winter chapter, or when you're carrying Ellie while running through the hospital at the end of the game. These small sequences are what makes The Last of Us only work as a game and not a film. Sure it's still exciting to watch, but when you have the controller in your hand, it's sensational. So even if you have ""seen"" the game, I highly recommend you play it for yourself, it's worth it.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,False,spoiler,lastofus,True,t3_1hw0sc,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1hw0sc/spoilers_to_those_who_watched_the_last_of_us/,

Got TLoU, played Normal/Survivor, silently stalked subreddit since. So many interesting thoughts and views; I really want to thank everyone for contributing here.  

I guess what's prompting me is the fact that I've seen many ""Team Joel""/""Team Fireflies"" posts, tenuous defenses of utilitarianism, some fanatical fervor, etc. and I thought I'd try to synthesize what I've read. 

Part of what made the game breathtaking was that **if the developers of The Last of Us wanted to make a game in which they cleanly cut bite-sized pieces of trauma, righteousness, and parental love, and then arrange those on a black-and-white plate, then that game would definitely not be The Last of Us.** This game was not shoot-and-dismiss. This game was as frustrating for my mind as it was for my heart. It challenged my initial reaction. 

Joel and Ellie aren't exactly like a parent and a child, just like Joel and Tess aren't exactly boyfriend and girlfriend. Their identities and relationships have been stressed and evolved after such a long time. And yes, the infected aren't too hard to kill, but after what Sam said... it gets creepy. And yes, vaccines and cures might be hard to achieve or distribute, but then again, we don't know all the details, and the details we do know provide confidence to people in charge so... who knows? And while we're playing as Joel, even Joel isn't entirely like the person he used to be, and, well, the whole game is about becoming something else, someone else. 

**I'm proud to say that I really don't know what I would do if I were those characters.** The important thing is that I understand the characters, and I can, a little. But a post-apocalyptic world? A dead son/daughter? Learning to kill and starve every day for 20 years? Being the burden of humanity's hope and cure? How could I look upon all of that and just say, ""Hah, it's so simple, I know how that would all go down for me!"" 

I don't mean to attack the wonderfully strong opinions. I too, think that Joel was cornered. I too, think that he didn't care enough about what Ellie wanted. I too, have sympathy for Joel, but I really don't think he was healthy. I too, think that the Trolley Problem tricks Ph.D's and gamers alike into hypocrisy, and yes, maybe it is more sensible for us to sacrifice one to save the many, but the fact that we give inconsistent responses to the Trolley Problem when it is rephrased shows how gray it is. And I too think that Marlene made a very difficult and infuriating decision. But I think instead of ""Fuck Marlene! Kill that bitch!"" we might say ""Wow. I am so sorry for her; she cared a lot for Ellie, and a lot of pain is going to come from her actions, whether she chooses to sacrifice Ellie or not."" 

I too, think that Ellie deserved to say what she wanted, and I think, in the end, we kind of know, because... well... she kind of knows... *kind of.*

I'm not angry at Joel. I don't like him, either. **But I know I would give him a hug if I saw him.** I'm just so sorry that all of these people live in a world that is destroying them on the inside, and I guess that notion grew every time I glanced between pictures of Bill and Frank (thanks u/LEOPOLDIII) and the angry letter Frank was left behind, or between a smiling family photograph and the red marks of ""Forgive us.""

Anyway, I just want to say thank you again, for everyone posting, because you've helped me come to these thoughts. And I'm glad because I have more perspective now. I could imagine myself in the shoes of the people who might be affected by Joel's actions or Marlene's actions for years to come. Maybe in the shoes of Bill and his growing isolation and growing inability to relate to others, or perhaps in David, just, knowing how much you hate his fucking guts, and then, admittedly, knowing that he must have been through some real disgusting shit, to make him who he is now (thanks u/RazakelApollyon and u/GobShite_ !) 

I could go on for another hundred pages about the incredible subtleties and the consistency and the music and the character design and the strong female characters and POC's, but everyone else already has. 

**TL;DR 1\. I judge people a lot fucking less now, and 2\. Shit is confusing as shit, but that's okay.**  

What a great gift. Sorry for ranting, and thanks for reading if anyone did. 

Edit: Thanks for the comments, guys! I'm still learning :D

I don't know what to feel, but I think it might be the best and also the worst game I've ever played. I can't decide.

Anyway, there is something really cool about the ending, at least in my case. 

When I killed the last Firefly soldier and was about to cross the door to the surgery room, I was almost sure that it was the very end of the game, but I was also afraid that may be I would have to fight a last time. And here is the cool thing: I almost wouldn't have anything to fight with.

My life was almost depleted. I don't think you can, in this game, have a lower amount of health. I would have died with anything. I actually thought the surgeon would kill me with the knife he holds when he says he won't allow you to interrupt the operation. Also I had used up to the very last of my bullets, arrows, medpacks and grenades, except for 12 bullets in the M4A1 I got from one of the fireflies and a smoke bomb. Also I didn't have supplies to craft shit.

I realized this when I still had 3 soldiers to kill and was covered behind something, trying to come up with a plan. And I did it. That felt great. Isn't that fucking epic? I had to give everything, up to the last drop of my blood.

Did something like this happen to you? How did you end the game?

1374966254.0,29,self.thelastofus,1j6pus,[Spoilers] More thoughts on the ending (hopefully new),PahoojyMan,29,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1j6pus/spoilers_more_thoughts_on_the_ending_hopefully_new/,"I Just rewatched the ending, and it seemed as though Joel's words to Ellie as she wakes up in the back seat could be construed as ""technically"" true (he's still lying by omission, but there are no direct lies):

&gt;We found the Fireflies.

Not much to disagree with here, although he doesn't mention their disposition at all.

&gt;Turns out, there's a whole lot more like you, Ellie. 

This has been discussed already. There are tapes in the hospital that mention ""others"" that have been studied. The problem is, that no details are given on these ""others"" except to say that Ellie is unique amongst them, and like nothing the doctor had seen before. 

This could be taken to mean that the ""others"" were just regular, infected people **or** they could have also shown signs of resistance or immunity to the cordyceps, just differently to Ellie.

&gt;People that are immune. It's dozens actually.

If we assume that Joel believes the latter, then he's not lying here, he could believe the fireflies found more immune people. Saying there were dozens could be hyperbole, not 'really' lying to Ellie.

&gt;Ain't done a damn bit of good neither.

This is true, the fireflies research so far hasn't produced anything to help fight the cordyceps fungus.

&gt;They've actually st- [Cut to Joel shooting Marlene] They've stopped looking for a cure.

Okay, while the fireflies hadn't stopped looking for a cure when Joel and Ellie arrived, what if we take this to mean that they've stopped ""now"" (when Joel actually says it to Ellie)?

Joel has just taken out a portion of what I believe is the Fireflies main base, including their leader, and one (or more, depending on how crazy you are) doctors/scientists. This could have been a fatal blow to the Fireflies' research, and their motivation and ability to continue it.

After some discussion in this sub, I was shown that Ellie has **her** backpack in the epilogue. I assumed this to be just a mistake, as the last we see before this point is Joel running away with Ellie, having only picked up his own backpack. But what if we look at the ending differently, assuming her backpack in the epilogue to be intentional?

After shooting Marlene once, we see Joel place Ellie in the back of the car. He then goes back to Marlene, who pleads for her life. Joel says that she'd only come after Ellie, and kills her. 

We see a change in Joel as he shoots Marlene the first time. He has gone from passively saving Ellie, removing her from danger by escaping, to actively saving her, removing the danger altogether.

If Ellie is supposed to have **her** backpack in the Epilogue, then this is the only time that Joel could have gone back for it. 

What if, after killing Marlene, Joel went back to the hospital to kill all of the remaining Fireflies there (As they'd only come after Ellie, like Marlene would)? He could have permanently destroyed all of the research while he was at it.

This would give more credit to the idea that Joel truly means it when he says that the Fireflies have stopped looking for a cure.",Spoiler,False,self,t5_2t7gp,1374966789.0,spoiler,,True,t3_1j6pus,http://www.reddit.com/r/thelastofus/comments/1j6pus/spoilers_more_thoughts_on_the_ending_hopefully_new/,

There are two times I can think of off the top of my head that incorporate giraffes, once towards the beginning when you find a little girl sitting in a corner clinging onto her giraffe doll
http://i.imgur.com/Qf7YBMw.jpg
and another much more obvious instance towards the end when joel and ellie encounter a pack of giraffes
http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/NfapMy-mIXo/maxresdefault.jpg

It seems to me that giraffes represent childhood.  The part with the girl holding her doll is easy to link, but the part with ellie and the pack is slightly more subtle.  This scene takes places not long after ellies encounter with david.  This scene can be easily seen as the loss of ellies innocence, or moreover the loss of her childhood.  Once she sees the giraffes though, she's suddenly brought out of her depressive slump and has all the energy and enthusiasm of a child again.  Suddenly though, the giraffes begin to walk off into the distance. This symbolizes ellie losing her childhood, as is further alluded to by her incredibly mature attitude on their mission immediately after the giraffes have left.

It reminds me a lot of Mass Effect 3, in the sense that I wasn't really expecting much, and was blown away by how deep a game there is.

[A friend and I were recording ourselves play some of it, in case you haven't had a chance to see how it plays.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5UkM-I1IDE)

E: Why would they mow down all these people?

J: Can't let everyone in.
