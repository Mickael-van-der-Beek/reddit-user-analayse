This is true Macintosh, not the (then new) Intel processor model.  Pretty fast, pretty powerful, pretty easy to use.  Family uses it for everything from simple web browsing to hi-end video editing and processing.

2005:  My company purchases a Dell laptop computer for me with Windows XP.  Nothing fancy, just a good old work computer.

Fast forward to 2012...

Apple no longer makes their own processor and has used only Intel processors for several years.  Due to the differences in architecture, Apple has stopped releasing upgrades to their operating system or ANY OTHER IMPORTANT APPLICATION for the Power Mac.  Since their browser never supported Flash (important for things other than just Youtube videos, such as online banking), I had always used Mozilla Firefox.  Well guess what, they stopped supporting the mac platforms.  Started using a 4th party browser, which is now no longer supported.  So... no big deal, we'll just use my work computer for those things.  Then...

The new iPhone is released, and Apple pushes out its new iOS6 operating system.  My son tries to download it over wi-fi and it crashes his iPod Touch.  No big deal, we'll connect to iTunes on the Power Mac and recover it.  BUT WAIT...in order to install iOS6 you have to upgrade to the latest iTunes version 10.6.  So let's try it.... and GUESS WHAT... it's not compatible with the Power Mac operating system, which is now frozen at Leopard.  So we can't update (Apple) iTunes, and can't revive the bricked (Apple) iPod with a (Apple) computer.  So....

Fire up the 7 year old Dell notebook with an operating system first released in 2001, clear off a little disk space (iTunes eats a TON of space), download and SUCCESSFULLY install iTunes 10.6, then easily recover the iPod functionality.  After copying some library files from the Mac to the Dell, everything is back in working order on the iPod.

So now we'll have to use the Microsoft-powered Dell for anything online that uses Flash, as well as anything else in our home that was made by Apple.  Meanwhile, that expensive and powerful G5 Power Mac is sitting in the corner getting less and less useful, like the great and powerful Oz wasting away behind the curtain with his superpowers exposed as simply smoke and hype.",,False,self,t5_2qhm5,False,,,True,t3_10vy46,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/10vy46/i_dont_usually_get_into_the_apple_vs_pc_thing_but/,

8x 1gb pc2-5300f-555-11 ram

1x ATI X1600pro Graphics Card

2x HIPRO HP-R650FF3 power supply (they slide side by side in the psu box, one acting as a backup)

1x 250gb WD HDD

1x 1 TB Green Cavier WD HDD

1x LG DVD drive

Okay so the issues is the PSU. It has a 24 pin, an 8 pin and 1 other 4 pin cables. They all need to be plugged in for the computer to run. The proplem is the sound... The psu is crazy loud. The plan was to buy a new one online but everywhere I look they only have:

1x 24 pin 
1x 8 pin 1x 
6 pin (for the gpu)

I need a power supply that has 3x 4 pin or 1x 8 pin and another 4 pin, if that makes sense. Any ideas? Are there IDE to 4 pin converters? Please let me know...

I purchased a laptop in 2008 that has since had its motherboard replaced twice, screen replaced twice, disc drive replaced 4 times, RAM replaced, keyboard replaced, casing replaced, and audio inputs replaced. My laptop model has a class action lawsuit against it, but HP flatly refuses to replace it.

In my most recent request to get my laptop fixed for the 7th time since purchase, I asked to have my warranty extended, given the product's poor history and HP 's willingness to extend the warranty for free in the past.

Tech support escalated claim to a case manager, call him Rod. Rod was initially receptive then became rude and dismissive. He claimed the laptop was obsolete and that my warranty didn't cover the repair I was asking for. After a long discussion he claimed he would contact corporate for a resolution.

A week passes. Rod ignores update phone calls and emails. I finally get a straight-to-voicemail message from him stating that corporate will fix my computer if I pay half. According to him, his words, this is an ""obsolete"" computer remember, that could not be fixed.

I call back multiple times and am unable to reach Rod. I talk to 2 different case managers and ask for their assistance. One hangs up on me after a long discussion about his inability to do anything.

The other claims my warranty already expired a year ago. Strange, because I've had it serviced 2x under warranty since the date she claims my warranty expired. After trying to explain how this information cannot be correct and being talked over and ignored, I ask for her supervisor. She claims she doesn't have a supervisor. I ask for her last name and she claims her last name is ""Case Manager."" I ask if she's serious and she insists that her last name is ""Case Manager."" She tells me she will transfer me to another case manager as there's nothing else she can do. I am put on indefinite hold.

I hang up and initiate a new claim with tech support for the same issue. A repair ticket is filed and the repair box is sent for free as per my warranty terms. My computer is fixed...again.

How can I get such disparate service claims from the case managers? Yet I'm able to skip past the managerial level and get the service they claimed I'd have to pay for, that COULD NOT be done because im out of warranty and obsolete.

HP has not extended my warranty and will not even let me pay for an extended warranty, I'm guessing based on how much they've spent repairing the machine in the past.

This laptop and the customer service from HP has been the worst I've ever experienced. I go through a similar battle every 6 months. As per my promise to the staff I talked to, I am doing my best to let everyone know what to expect when you buy from HP.

UPDATE
Just got a call back from Rod, who explains that my computer is obsolete and now he cannot even offer the half payment option for the repair. I don't think Rod is aware of my other service claim. 

He further explains that he cannot offer any money, service, or replacement computer even though I am still under warranty until the end of 2012. I tell him that this is a breach of contract and I want this statement in writing from him. He baulks and puts me on hold. 

When Rod returns from being on hold, he tells me that his supervisor is now looking at the case and I should get a call from them. I ask again for his statement in writing. He refuses and puts me on hold, then hangs up on me.

I contact text chat support and request the service notes Rod won't give me. The service ticket no longer exists in their system. 

**TL:DR** HP is refusing to honor warranty service on a laptop they're claiming is obsolete. No compensation is available for the breach of contract.",,False,self,t5_2qhm5,True,,,True,t3_serur,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/serur/my_hp_experience/,

Thank you for contacting Adobe Sales. My name is Aseiya. How may I help you today?
Aseiya: Hi, may I have your first name please?
you: jim
Aseiya: Hello Jim.  
Aseiya: How may I help you with your purchase today?
you: I have a question about the new adobe suite
Aseiya: Sure, please proceed.    
you: I am a freelance designer and I was noticing that Adobe CC requires a monthly fee, is this the end of being able to buy outright newer versions of the creative suite ie: adobe cs 7, or is this just going to be another option
Aseiya: No going forward all adobe software will be available in subscription form.
you: so, i own the cs6 suite, from school, now I graduated, does this mean if I want to ever upgrade my suite I will not be able to own my own copy? and if so, why has adobe went this route
Aseiya: Before we proceed, to assist you better, could you let me know the kind of tasks you would like to accomplish with the software?
Aseiya: No, if you upgrade to CC membership you'll still own your CS6 copy.  
you: well, I edit photos, I am a web designer, I edit videos, and composite them using after effects, and do dabble in adobe audition for audio mixing
Aseiya: You'll not lose your CS6 version.
you: yes I know but will they continue to give cs6 updates and features or will I have to subscribe and not own a newer version, it seems odd that I cant own a newer version and concerns me
Aseiya: If you subscribe to CC version you'll get the future upgrades for free.      
you: yes but I wont get to ever keep it, I will have to constantly pay adobe for something I should own
you: I only upgrade every 2 years usually
you: is there no way to buy out right the newer versions I am saying, I like owning my product
Aseiya: I understand your concern, I'm sorry we do not have the option to purchase the upgrade outright.
Aseiya: Since you own CS6 you'll get a special price on CC membership.  
you: thank you I just wanted to make sure adobe was indeed no longer letting us costumers own something we pay for, thank you for your time.

I ordered 6 of these. One dies after completely loading the system while migrating docs on an emergency Sunday laptop repair for my boss's boss, tested the rest and found another DOA. OCZ was quick to RMA, but it makes me seriously question the thoroughness of the refurb process. Slim margins and all, I'm guessing damage control is cheaper than catching the bad ones.

That's not my big beef though. I tried twice to submit an inoffensive, appropriate cautionary review on the retailer site that 33% of my order was bad. Not only did they not get posted, but two generic, anonymous, glowing reviews appeared instead. This stinks to high heaven. I complained to the retailer, got a generic response on posting policy so I replied with a completely acceptable review I planned to post and expected to see on the site within 24 hours, or receive a reply explaining precisely how it was against review policy. 24 hours later and it's not there. In my opinion this seems to be stacking the deck on product reviews.

They've lost my business forever.

I just implemented a new feature on this subreddit: The ability to mark questions as resolved! As some of you may have noticed, any posts that you make will now have a 'mark resolved' option on both the subreddit frontpage and on the actual post page. 

    

As with most everything on this subreddit, marking questions resolved is completely optional. I would like to encourage people to start marking resolved questions, however, as it will allow us to more efficiently see who still needs help. Marking your questions as resolved means that others will get help faster, which improves the overall quality of the subreddit :]


    

**When you mark a thread as resolved, PLEASE consider editing the original post with a brief description of what you did to fix the problem, or even just a link or indication of the post in the thread that was helpful to you.** 

    

Search engines are indexing this subreddit, and many people are stumbling across these threads. We all know that [awful feeling](http://xkcd.com/979/) when you stumble across some old forum post from a guy with the same issue as you, only to scroll down and see him say ""Hey! I fixed it!"" with no explanation as to what he did. Let's try to hold this subreddit to higher standards and leave useful information for future generations of googlers.


    

~~For those of you that want a technical explanation of what I did (since this IS a computer related subreddit): I just used CSS tweaks to change the nsfw tag into a 'thread resolved' tag. The CSS selectors reddit gives me mean that I can easily change the opacity on 'nsfw' threads, giving me the ability to gray out threads accordingly. The CSS is borrowed almost verbatim from /r/tf2trade, all credit goes to those guys.~~    


~~Of course this means that we can't have nsfw posts here anymore, but that wasn't the focus of this subreddit. While nsfw posts aren't explicitly banned, this just helps to reinforce my policy of discouraging those types of posts.~~

~~There *is* an undesired side effect that if /r/computers posts pop up in /r/all, which doesn't see my CSS tweaks, then some posts will be marked nsfw with no apparent reason. But I'm willing to live with this compromise, since it should be apparent by the titles that the posts are not actually nsfw.~~



**EDIT:** Using link flair now, per a suggestion from /u/gavin19! Thanks for your input!

I'm typing this on my iPod right now so please excuse any weird autocorrects or anything.

I'm so distressed. It's 12:40 am, I was just drinking tea to help me relax/browsing reddit when i clumsily dumped about 1/2 of it all over my computer!! It got everywhere. I'm concerned most about the fact that the tea is all over the keyboard/near where I assume the important parts are. The computer didn't immediately shut off - the cursor was flying rapidly around the screen, but I was able to shut it down so I could remove the case. It shut down fine + after I cleaned it up with a damp paper towel, I attempted to turn it back on (probably a bad idea?) It made a loud beeping noise that lasted for approximately 2 seconds before shutting off again. I tried once more + I heard it powering up but it just shut off again.

Here's a little backstory + the reason I'm so upset about this: I received this computer as part of a Make-A-Wish wish. I have (a very mild case of ) cystic fibrosis. I had to make a choice about my wish + since I'm so close to being ineligible to participate (age-wise), I chose to get a new computer. I'm not used to having things like this - I've been using the same 1st gen. iPod since it first came out and am kind of frugal when it comes to technology. So you can (hopefully) imagine why I'm so upset + help me out if possible.

I'm so upset that this happened, please, please, please, please can anyone give me advice on what to do? Is there anyway to prevent my computer from going deadz on me? Or, at the very least, does anyone know if Apple Support is forgiving with this kind of stuff? :( I have a warranty (I hope it's still valid - I received the computer brand-new in August).

I'm a middle-school teacher, primarily English, but I also have an interest in computers: building, fixing, HTML, Basic Java, professional programs (photoshop and the such. Next year, in addition to my English classes, I will be heading up the school's new computers class, and I wanted to get some input as to what the /r/computers felt were important topics to cover.

This is a basic computer class, so it will cover a bit of everything, and I'm assuming students know *how* to use a computer, but nothing about computers themselves.

Topics I've thought about so far...

* Use of MS Word and the History of computers - Conducting research, creating a professional looking research paper
* Use of Excel Datasheet and Formulas - Student created surveys and collection of information, producing and presenting their results (maybe the inclusion of PPT for the presentation portion?)
* Photoshop basics - Layers, editing tools, project involving doctoring an existing photo (head swaps?)
* HTML Basics - The structure of building websites, simple coding procedures, done through codeacademy
* JavaScript Basics - The basics of programming and coding (Hello World project?) Also, codeacademy
* Computers in our World today - Second research paper on the use of computers today (military applications, gaming, music, industry, education, etc.)

Any thoughts or opinions, as to changes I can make, resources I should tap, units of study to consider, please let me know! As far as I can tell, I'm reinventing the wheel here as most classes in high-school and college tend to focus on one subject rather than a multitude.

Here are some of the things he suggested. What do you guys think? Do these actually work? Has anyone tried them out? I googled some of the items and it sounded people were 50/50 about tweaking these settings.

•Always back up the system or verify the restore point
•Restart the computer whenever prompted (this will determine if the computer can handle the change)
•For restore menu, hold F8 (or F12, F2 depends on bios) before you see the logo splash screen appear when you restart a PC.

**Msconfig**
type Msconfig.exe  on Command prompt
	Edit the startup
	Remove all the programs that start up with the computer that are not needed for the PC’s task, this is an important step because a lot of programs love to add their software updates to this list. Only remove the programs you do not need. Leave any Microsoft System required programs. 

UAC settings = set it to none
Why? Windows adds an unnecessary step when approving something and it’s annoying when working on the pc.

**Services**
Got to services.exe 
Remove Windows live ID, Parent Controls, Tablet Controls, and other programs that are not needed. 
This task will depend PC to PC. 
Why? Because there are programs running on the background that are not needed, they take resources. If it’s a production computer it should run the main programs for the job.  Minimize the risk of getting errors and updates from unnecessary programs.

**Advance System Settings**
	Visual Effects
		Set to adjust for best performance
			But keep, visual styles, drop shadow for icon label.
Why? No need for fancy process grabbing effects, this is a business PC. Plus you will not notice most of them.
	Advanced  
Set for programs, look for virtual memory, Click “Change”, uncheck “Automatically manage paging “and use the recommended size 
 
**Increase core parking (mostly for laptops) could be dangerous, skip is needed**
Why? This is great if the PC has a constant heavy load from a demanding program. 

In Command prompt 
powercfg -attributes SUB_PROCESSOR 0cc5b647-c1df-4637-891a-dec35c318583 -ATTRIB_HIDE powercfg -attributes SUB_PROCESSOR ea062031-0e34-4ff1-9b6d-eb1059334028 -ATTRIB_HIDE

Go to power settings 
Set Processor power to 100%, this means that the processor will not step down when system is idle. 

**Do not check Drivers **
	Some versions of Windows run the driver versifier at random to check your drivers. This is good if it uncovers problems, but otherwise it slows you down.

**How to Configure and Use IntFiltr. Google for download**
Why ? Binding of device interrupts to particular processors on multiprocessor computers is a useful technique to maximize performance, scaling, and partitioning of large computers
1.	Run IntFiltr.exe located in the Config folder of this package.
2.	Under Devices, click the appropriate device, and then use Add Filter and Remove Filter to turn interrupt filtering on and off, respectively. When IntFiltr is installed on a device, the string ""InterruptAffinityFilter"" appears in the Upper Filters box.
3.	Select the Set Mask option to set the CPU affinity for the selected device interrupt, or select the Delete Mask option to remove a device CPU affinity mask from the registry.

NOTE: Installing IntFiltr on a device has no useful effect if no CPU affinity mask exists for a device.

**Change system priorities using software “Prio”**
Why? ""Windows"" shares the processor time between all running processes based upon their priority.  If a process has higher priority, it gets more processor time compared to a process having lower priority.
	http://www.askvg.com/how-to-permanently-set-process-priority-in-windows-task-manager/
Do not set the priority to “Real Time’ if the program was not designed to run in real time. Most programs are not able to run in real time unless they were designed to run in real time.

**Create a batch file to refresh explorer.exe**
Why?   It’s a way to troubleshoot Computer Errors, or if it starts to run slowly. 
Open an notepad.exe
Enter this code 
@echo off
 taskkill /f /IM explorer.exe
 explorer.exe
Save it as a .bat file 
Place it on the desktop and tell user to double click it if computer slows down
Works for TABLETS!!!! 


**Event Viewer.exe**
	Search for event viewer on windows. 
	This is a build in program in windows that shows you all the failures the system experienced. 
	It is a detailed list; it will show the process that failed and the time. 
	Why? Makes it is easy to trouble shoot errors.

So I thought, with the Steam Summer Sale going on right now, I would but my games cheap so I could have something to play when I finally get my gaming PC.  When I asked my parents about getting a desktop to replace it, they said yes, but to look at somewhere where one could be bought and didn't have to be assembled.  This includes stores like Best Buy and online shopping like newegg and Amazon.

I currently play game like Fallout, Skyrim, The Simes, GTAIV, Payday, Counter-Strike, and Scribblenauts.  My computer has a hard time handling games like Scribblenauts and Counter Strike Source, and is painful to play on.

I need something that can run all my games on medium/high quality (if possible) ultra high because that's what I really want.

So far, I already have the
[monitor](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Dell+-+24%26%2334%3B+Widescreen+LED+Monitor/2976125.p?id=1218368603868&amp;skuId=2976125), [speakers](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/2.0+5+W+Home+Audio+Speaker+System+-+Pack+of+1/9607196.p?id=1218130499395&amp;skuId=9607196&amp;st=speakers&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=3#tabbed-customerreviews2), and the keyboard between [this, which I  love the color](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZKXXAU/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=AFCE9RG0HT18U) and [this, which is a cheaper version of the other one.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PJ4PN2/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER)

My budget was a thousand, but after the Monitor, Speakers, and Keyboard, it is down to $750

I really don't know waht to look for in a gaming PC, and I need your guys' help and I need to make this decision by TODAY.

THANK YOU!

EDIT: This is what I've really wanted the beginning, does this have the decent enought specs do play the games what I want at medium/high quality?

My external 3TB drive just crapped out on me. This was my backup drive with everything on it, all pictures going back 7 years, tons of other personal documents, and a bunch of work related stuff. Now it's all gone. 

Data recovery is not a real option since it was fully encrypted so partial data fragments do me absolutely no good. To make it worse these past few days I was planning on doing this but haven't gotten a suitable drive to backup that much data.

It was a seagate barracuda 3TB drive that's just about a year old.

I tried the freezer trick with no luck. then I got desperate. I swapped out the PCB on the drive which you can do on this model without taking it apart and just a few screws, no luck.

1367541538.0,9,self.computers,1dl768,It Seems Like I Am the Only One Here Who Thinks Windows 8 Is Pretty Damn Good. Allow Me to Explain Why.,LePetomane,25,16,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/1dl768/it_seems_like_i_am_the_only_one_here_who_thinks/,"OK, so I installed Windows 8 pro (32-bit) onto a Bootcamp partition on my early 2007 MacBook Pro when Windows 8 was publicly released in October 2012. I paid $40 on a Windows upgrade promotional offer, so what the hell, I'll try it. I was used to Windows 7 Ultimate (32-bit), which I previously had installed on my Bootcamp partition, and I thought it was pretty good, though I still preferred my Mac OS (OS 10.7 ""Lion""), which is 64-bit.

I downloaded Windows 8 Pro and burnt it to a DVD so I could do a clean, fresh install. The installation process went surprisingly quick, probably taking about 30-min. Then, I had to install the Apple Bootcamp software to get all the Apple drivers. Nothing too major here.

In the beginning, I was lost and thrown for a loop with Windows 8. I considered going back to Windows 7 for a short period of time. I couldn't find anything - task manager, control panel, etc. And, no ""Start"" menu! WTF? Well, as I familiarized myself with 8, I soon realized that the Start menu didn't go anywhere - it just got bigger! Windows 8 is basically Windows 7 with ""Metro"" (Start menu) added to it, along with a few new performance tweaks and features. 

Fast forward through 6 months of familiarization, and now I find myself preferring booting up Windows 8 over Lion on my Mac. Even though it's 32-bit, Windows 8 sure feels faster and more responsive than my 64-bit OSX ""Lion"" installation, and I thought I would never catch myself saying something like that. 

Windows 8 feels like it uses my computer's resources more efficiently. For example, when I click on MS Word 2010, a blank document opens immediately. I am blown away by this. In OSX, when I command MS Word 2011 to open, I get to watch the ""W"" icon bounce up and down in the dock several times before a blank document appears. Time enough to grab a beer from the refrigerator. In Windows 7, it took about the same amount of time. When booting into Windows 8, it boots up remarkably fast - about 10-seconds to the login screen. Windows 7 and OSX both take far longer to boot.

There are many other things I like about Windows 8, and I will say it is probably my favorite Windows version yet. But for the sake of brevity, I'll leave it at this. I hear many people bitch about how bad it sucks and no start screen, metro, yada yada, but my guess is they aren't being patient and giving it a fair chance.

To summarize what I've said, Windows 8 is pretty fast and responsive, more so than any other versions of Windows I have used. On my 6-year-old MacBook Pro, Windows 8 blows OSX ""Lion"" out of the water as far as responsiveness and boot time are concerned. All of my programs load very quickly in 8, and run very stable and responsively with no hiccups or snafus. Windows 8 for the desktop is basically Windows 7, with some added features geared toward tablets. In addition, functional under-the-hood improvements are apparent in 8, which I feel make more efficient use of computer resources to make it as responsive as it is. 

I'm neither an Apple or Microsoft fanboy. I recognize the fact that both products have their place, each with pluses and minuses. I try to look at things from a functional, objective standpoint, and I appreciate both. That said, and as a layman, I say well done to Microsoft with regard to Windows 8. It breathes refreshing new life into my old Core2 Duo computer box. Thanks for reading, and happy computing.

Since I get to build/design my resources from the ground up, I want to come out of the gate with the best, most efficient system possible. I will have a research group of ~ 8 graduate students etc... I am a pretty basic PC user without a lot of in depth knowledge of what is really possible with computer systems, so I am appealing to those who know better. I have tech-related goals on 2 fronts; my research group and teaching in the classroom.

For my research group, I personally will run on both a MAC and PC desktop in my office, and use a laptop/tablet (not sure if this will be PC or MAC) for mobile/home use.

I will have ~4 desktop PCs for multipurpose use by the students in the research group. I also plan to have a nice laser printer that I hope any of these computers can print from. I want to have a backup/digital storage location (probably 1 or 2 large capacity USB hard drives) that can be accessed by all computers and maybe even doing some automatic backup of all the group’s files. Also, I anticipate many students using their own laptops as well, so it would be great if there is an easy way to integrate those into the whole setup. 

On the teaching front, the only real goal is to be able to put up a powerpoint presentation with the lecture hall’s projector, then maybe use a tablet and stylus to be able to write over the slides during lectures.

So… I am open to ANY suggestions, from what type of hardware to look at all the way to how to network the components and even any cool software ideas you all may have. Please, any advice could potentially help me a lot.

Just for fun I decided to explore a bit and see what goes where; actually see what things are.  I fully believed that I would be able to accomplish this task so I started unplugging things. As I was taking careful notes where I  was taking things out of (I took out the PSU). My mother dropped by unannounced so I set aside what I was doing and socialized for a bit.

As soon as she left I began dusting everything off (never new just how much dust there was in there...) Come time to put everything back together again, I notice that while I was dusting it out I had misplaced my notebook.

I found myself cocky and felt that I could accomplish such a task...after all its just plugging in cables again right? Well I just spent two hours trying to get my computer to recognize my SATA II(now know that there are different kinds...) because I forgot to plug the damn thing in!  Booted up fine, but never understood how frustrating it can be to find something so small.

Don't really know if this goes here or not but thought maybe it would cause some to reminisce about horrible exerience, or laugh at my suffering.

You can order it now and it was proposed to be the first Steambox styled PC available.

It costs around 1000$ and the hardware is freaking weaksause for that price.

It's supposed to be a compact prebuilt ""gaming"" system, yet, although it has a grunty CPU and plenty of ram, they decided to go the ultra low power route with an APU integrated GPU, instead of a discrete GPU.

For the same price you could, with some effort, even assemble an SLI Radeon 7970 based system and I'm pretty sure that you can buy many pre-built systems, even from the more pricy brands, that are much more powerful, for less then that.


I am confused now, is the Xi3 Piston supposed to be a Steambox, or a low power media PC?

If the later, what's the point? Nowadays, even a 500$ 46"" TV is a Smart TV  and can often play just about any Android game at full res.


Is this why Valve suddenly fired a bunch of their hardware guys? Because they knew that Xi3 would come out with an overpriced POS like this?



EDIT: For the donkeys that keep repeating this has nothing to do with Valve and this was never supposed to be THE steambox, check out TB's latest Content Patch, he brings together the information from before and just now.

Hi Adam,

 

Now is not a good time to be buying hard disk drives. There is a shortage due to flooding in Thailand.

 

Some time ago, I quoted you $210, which included a 1TB hard disk drive. But since then, prices of hard disk drives have gone up by around 150%

 

The price to supply and install a 1000GB hard disk drive now, with data cloned from the existing drive, is $340

 

 


Regards Chris.

I emailed him earlier this year about getting an upgrade but then decided not to get it due to the price, now that price has increased and I need to get a larger hard drive for photos, music, games etc.

Has the flooding in Thailand really increased hardrive prices? And does anyone know of any cheaper alternatives, bear in mind that the quote he gave me includes a file transfer and the installation of the new hardrive.

Before that I had my trusty university PC. I took it apart, put it back together, upgraded it, put in new DVD drives and ultimately ran it into the ground (to the point where some deep hardware issue just became too much hassle for me to want to fix it) inside of three years, and sold it for a few quid to help me in the US.

When I got here my wife was using a Mac (iBook G4), which was my first introduction to them. It felt weird initially and then I got used to it. I bought a cheap VERY secondhand iMac G3 (all-in-one CRT job) and used that until it started to die and the issue of my iPod having as large a disk as the iMac became tiresome. Then a friend at a design agency gave me a free G4 tower when they upgraded their offices, and this is now starting to chug a little. It's a 1.25 GHx PowerPC G4, 765MB SDRAM. I know I could upgrade the RAM...but not running later OS X versions could get old.

Aaanyway. Here's the crux:

I have a chunk of change available sufficient to pick up a Macbook or low end iMac...but I'm wondering if I should. From tinkering with my PC in England, I now mostly use my computer for iTunes, Internet and photos...hardly anything challenging for current computers.

While my entire house is wired for apple - Apple TV, Airport, iPhone (gift, gift, coveted toy) I miss PC gaming (Steam looks VERY tempting). I've been on Xbox 360 for the last 3 years, but some things don't cut it.

I've started noticing a lot of bloatware on our rigs. This is a natural byproduct of bringing them out on jobs and needing to install miscellaneous pieces of software for specific tasks (i.e. QuickTime, Java), as well as loading them up with media, slates etc. that don't end up getting cleared at the end of each day. This also leaves the machines vulnerable to viruses and spyware, and will likely eventually lead to reduced performance, and stability of these machines is paramount when they are being used for broadcast or recording.

I'm not sure of the best way to approach this, but is there any way to always boot into a clean, stock version of Windows 7? The best thing I could come up with is booting from a read-only VHD but I'm not sure if Windows can actually run on a read-only disc image. Obviously recordings and media would need to be stored outside of the VHD and we'd have to boot outside of it if we needed to do any side tasks, but that's not an issue if it could just write outside of the VHD itself. It would be even better if we were able to write to the VHD but it just ""reset"" itself on every boot... we'd just have to remember to never store anything important on the volume.

Okay. Laptop (LED backlit) screen took a bash from above while it was closed. I open it up, and the screen isn't working.

Here's two images of the problem: 
http://imgur.com/FEGsUk3 
http://imgur.com/TEyCBWp

The first image is when pressure is applied to the screen, and the second without pressure. You can sort of see liquid in the bottom right.

The fact that the screen changes when I touch it suggests to me that it's a broken screen as opposed to a dislodged or broken screen/LVDS cable, but I'd like to get a second opinion before I go get another screen and try to fit it. BTW, I've never fit a new laptop screen, so if there's anything I should be really careful of, please mention- I'm a little bit experienced and fairly confident at replacing stuff but have never done this.

The laptop also, btw, works fine when you send it out to an external monitor, so it ain't the graphics card.

Again, thanks to anyone who helps.

I'm here to ask you: given your current needs and wants, what hardware would suit you comfortably?

As an example and my own case, I have an AMD A8-3520M APU Laptop. It's a simple Llano laptop APU. I'm oddly finding it very sufficient for my needs, and even a little too generous for my needs.

My needs are simply browsing the web, watching videos, doing a bit of gaming (GRID and BFBC2 with lots of other casual games), and doing some penetrating testing. The computer I currently have is definitely suiting me perfectly in terms of power, but my gaming zeal is going down, and I'm sure once I get bored of BFBC2 (not for awhile unfortunately), my computer power needs will drop like a rock, leaving GRID as my sole ""intensive"" application (I dont think I'll ever get bored of it... I love it so.) 

To go down the list;
AMD A8 3520M - Has two extra cores I rarely ever utilize unless I'm playing BFBC2.
6620G IGP - Suits me perfectly, but will soon become more than needed once I get bored of BFBC2.
640 GB 5400 RPM Toshiba HDD - I only use 140 GB of it... That number is slowly dropping as I remove games slowly and get bored of them. Maybe going from 5400 to 7200 or even SSD may be more comfy for me however.
Slim ODD - I hardly ever use this thing... I only use it to dualboot Backtrack 5... Which can be run off USB...

There are some other specs, but those specs seem to suit me fine or are pretty standard across the board. Either way, my laptop will soon be much more powerful than I need... Looks like my next computer might be an ULV laptop that is significantly smaller than my current one (15.6"" is seriously not mobile when it's your primary computer.) with possibly a larger resolution (1366x768 is fine for everything... But have a larger resolution is nice when on reddit or 4chan...)

So, what suits you?

A little lost.  I've been looking for parts to build a Media Server for a theater.  
 
I've severely overpowered this thing for our needs, because, why not?

So far, I've picked a Gigabyte motherboard that has the switchable graphics feature.

2x NVidia GTX 660SC cards (for the four simultaneous output options)

i7 with intel hd4000.

The Mobo has VGA/HDMI/DVI/Displayport outputs, and I know hd4000 can run up to three monitors from the mobo, correct?

also, having two gtx 660 cards can do potentially 8 outputs...

now, with Optimus or Switchable Graphics, can I set this computer up to run 11 simultanous outputs?  4 of which will be for projectors, 1 or 2 dedicated to preview monitors/editing... I think 1 or 2 will be split with triple head 2 go's and then sent via cat5 to the stage.... etc

From what I'm reading this can't work the way I'm seeing it... Switchable Graphics tend to choose one or the other depending on the application... I'm only planning on running one application for this computer... is there a way to utilize every output in order to run video from one computer to every projector and video wall in the house?  

If this doesn't work... is there any other method or hardware configuration that allows for at least 10-12 simultaneous outputs that can do 6-8 layers of 1080p?

I used to have an HP laptop, but it died last year and I never replaced it due to not really needing one. Now, though, I end up in the hospital for extended periods of time (cancer sucks) and being without a laptop is awful. I'm trying to work on getting into law schools, and completing applications with no computer access is very difficult. I'd also like to be able to watch Netflix in the hospital, access the internet, etc. For now, I just use my cell phone. 

I'm looking to buy something affordable as my medical bills really stretch me for cash. I'm looking at a few on Amazon right now that are under $400. I don't need to do anything that would be super difficult for a basic computer to handle. I've also looked at the Chromebooks but I don't know how I feel about them yet.

I put together a fairly decent computer rig built towards gaming and I've really enjoyed it so far. My roommates and I love playing games together. Problem is, one of my roommate has a really shitty computer and can't run games like Left 4 Dead or Borderlands. My question is since I have two monitors and an extra keyboard, is there any way that I would be able to allow multiple users complete control over my computer so that we could both play a game off of it? I've never heard of anything like this before and I was wondering if it was even possible. The computer can definitely handle two clients running, that wouldn't be the problem. Is there a program that would allow this functionality? Perhaps a virtual box, or additional partition would be the answer? Or is this just completely not possible?

1345924019.0,7,self.computers,ythg1,How to make Windows 8 RTM usable,daLuiz,10,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/ythg1/how_to_make_windows_8_rtm_usable/,"Hello Reddit

This will be a growing collection of tips, how to fix Windows 8. I am currently running the RTM evaltuation version of Windows 8 Enterprise ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/jj554510.aspx ). I use the German version, so please excuse if some menu labels are not entirely perfect. Feel free to correct me ;)

These are the fixes I applied:

**Reduce the fat window borders:**

* start regedit
* set in [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics]:
* ""CaptionWidth""=""-255""
* ""CaptionHeight""=""-255""
* ""PaddedBorderWidth""=""0""

**Disable all animations:**

* go to the control panel
* click ""Ease of Access Center""
* ignore / disable the voice
* click ""Make the Computer easier to use""
* check ""Turn off all unnecessary animations""

**Disable the ""drag-away"" Lock-Screen**

* run gpedit.msc
* go to Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; All Settings
* Double click ""Do not display the lock screen"" and activate it

**Create your own quick-launch menu**

* I quite liked the old quick-launch menu, so I re-created it to host my most-used programs ( http://i.imgur.com/Q3yfA.jpg )
* right click the task bar, click ""Toolbars"", choose ""New Toolbar""
* choose a folder, click ok. Put your links in this folder.
* disable ""fix taskbar"", drag the new toolbar to the left
* right-click it, disable ""Show Text"" and ""Show Title""
* resize to your liking, and fix the taskbar again

**Make the ~~Metro~~-Screen usable**

* This may be obvious, but once you remove all the trash (right click and ""Un-pin from Start"" at the bottom) and you really only keep the Programs you actually use there, it all of a sudden becomes a quite nice program launcher.
* Many Programs install a lot of links to the Start screen. Remove all except the main program shortcut, that you actually might use.
* The other shortcuts are not lost. You can still reach the equivalent of the old start menu via right click in the Start screen and choosing ""All Apps"" in the lower right corner.

**Get the important desktop links**

* Again something quite simple, but essential (to me)
* right click your desktop
* choose ""Personalize""
* on the left, click ""Change desktop icons""
* Activate the ones you need, I reccomend at least ""Computer"" and ""Control Panel""

**Use the Mini-Start Menu**

* While in Desktop, move the mouse to the lower left corner, so that the Start Menu button appears
* Right-Click
* enjoy :)

Other than that.. just avoid ~~Metro~~. It might be nice on a tablet, but it's useless on a PC. If you have any non-~~Metro~~ Program in your autostart, It will go to the desktop at boot automatically.

If you have further ideas please post them, I will update this post. Now enjoy Windows 8, it's actually quite nice :)",,False,self,t5_2qhm5,1346777958.0,,,True,t3_ythg1,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/ythg1/how_to_make_windows_8_rtm_usable/,

It is not a commercial product. You don't buy Internet explorer, you can't run it on anything other than windows, and it costs money to develop. What is in it for microsoft?

1375490328.0,7,self.computers,1jllvg,I can't make up my mind with the Razer Blades...Help would be greatly appreciated.,NerdAccount,10,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/1jllvg/i_cant_make_up_my_mind_with_the_razer_bladeshelp/,"Hey guys.

**(I didn't get much of a response from /r/suggestalaptop so I'm x-posting here, if that's okay...)**

So as the title of this post says I can't make up my mind concerning the new Razer laptops.
Before I get into this, I just want to note that I'm entering college in the fall so I'm going to need a portable computer. As most Razer product users are, I'm also an avid gamer. I have a desktop that runs games flawlessly on ultra, so I was looking for a laptop that could complement that while I'm gone, and I found the Razer Blade and the Pro.

Price is not really an issue since I know I'm making an investment that will be worth 3-4 years.
The major issue that I'm facing is the screen size and quality.

The Pro weighs in at about 6.5 pounds (not so awesome) and sports a 17 inch screen with 1920x1080 resolution - very awesome. Will a 17 inch laptop be too large?

To me this SHOULD be where the regular Blade comes in -- 14 inches 4.5 pounds, but the resolution isn't all that great (matte 1650x900 TN screen) and I haven't heard great things about the screen quality. However I'll be carrying it around a lot so the relatively minimal weight is a big plus for me.

I've had a Macbook Pro (13 inch) since June 2008, so either way it would be a pretty big laptop upgrade for me. I most likely will not be bringing in my gaming pc to school, since it's so damn big.
Now, what others have suggested I do is that I should get the 14 inch Blade and bring my big monitor (I have a 27 inch display) to my dorm, so that when I'm in my room and want to game or something I can just plug it in via HDMI. (By the way, will that let me keep the 1080p resolution or will it just revert to 1650x900 ? I apologize for the noob question).

Blade Pro owners- just how portable is it? Does it feel clunky/ heavy?

Regular Blade owners- do you wish you had more screen space and higher res?

Thanks, guys! Much appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2qhm5,1375490678.0,,,True,t3_1jllvg,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/1jllvg/i_cant_make_up_my_mind_with_the_razer_bladeshelp/,

But the card had another 120 or so shots worth of space when suddenly, an error message pops up on the LED screen saying that the card cannot be read and there may be a problem with the card.  Wouldn't let me take any more photos, and I couldn't review the photos I'd already taken.  I don't know what prompted the error - I took one shot and it worked, and on the next shot it didn't.  I didn't press any buttons, didn't eject anything between shots, no battery foul-ups, nothing.  I have no idea what happened, but it happened.

When I got home, I safely ejected the card when the camera and ""Do Not Turn Off"" light were off.  I plugged it into the card reader on my computer, and the computer wouldn't read it.  I looked on my desktop, in my finder, and in Disk Utility, and it's not showing up anywhere.

If anyone has any ideas for getting the computer to read the card OR to recover the card data in some other fashion, I'd really appreciate it.

Think again,Muvian,9,3,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/vgubi/think_your_surge_protector_has_a_connected_device/,"I recently suffered some lightning damage that took out my desktop, laptop and router. I contacted the manufacturer of my surge protector, Woods Industries and explained what happened and what model number I had. The person told me that I needed to send in a repair bill (totaling $2404.58), the surge protector, a receipt and a description of what happened. 

After two weeks I contacted the company again and they informed me that my protector was being tested. After two more weeks I contacted them again and then they informed me that the surge protector did indeed fail and that it wasn't covered under the warranty. I asked the person to send me a copy of the warranty information and read it over several times and no where does it state that the warranty doesn't cover lightning.

The person also tried to tell me that hardly no one else covered lightning. I started doing a little research and the 10 companies I found that had Connected Equipment warranties all of them covered lightning: Belkin, Monster, IPX, Panamax, ITW Linx, Tripp Lite, APC, Philips, CyberPower and even Fellows had a $15 surge protector that had a $5000 connected equipment warranty that covered lightning.

I think that I'm being lied to just so they don't have to pay. I did everything they asked and now they are not standing behind their warranty. I am a college student that makes a living on my computer, I might have been okay if it was just one that was down but with both down I am unable to do any work and I can't afford to repair it myself.

after this, i ran a memory management sweep and upon next restart, everything booted up fine. I'm guessing somehow the proper boot info in the Master Boot Record got corrupted (despite no changes to my PC) and had to be re-initialized. pain in the ass, but im back in business.

I found a $570 ready made computer on Newegg.  I then (quickly) went across the site and found all the parts that came with it to compare what it would cost.  It came to $530 for the lowest priced comparable parts, NOT INCLUDING THE CASE -it was cheap so let's assume $25. So that brings it to $555

Now, I haven't run this test with a $1500 machine, so don't get me wrong. I have no idea if this scales. But seriously, what's the point of buying all these parts, putting it all together, dealing with different manufacturers, rebates, warranties; not to mention all the work?

As a result, when her caretakers leave for the day, she is put to bed with the TV on, but without the ability to change the channel, pick a movie to watch, or even make a phone call.

Given voice recognition technology today, it seems like it should be possible to set up a voice-activated computer that can understand at first a few keywords to accomplish at least the simplest of things (calling a phone number). 

It seems like a pretty lightweight piece of software would be able to accomplish this and still be pretty extensible (assign a voice command to a programmed macro for example). 

Does anybody have any experience with setting something like this up? Or perhaps there is a solution already for a lot of these things?

In my mind I see a couple things:

-A computer is connected to the TV and a tuner, giving it the power to change the channel through a few simple vocal commands (channel up/down, volume up/down, tv on/off)

-A VoIP program enables phone use (this is probably the most important feature!)

-Remote desktop access allows her to call somebody to fix a problem, or set up a Netflix movie or something similar.

-Directional microphone to pick up the commands

http://www.seagate.com/external-hard-drives/portable-hard-drives/standard/backup-plus/

I had some problems with my (silver) external hard-drive earlier in the year, so I sent it to a shop to have it repaired. It was malfunctioning to the point where it wouldn't even be recognized by my computer. When I got it back from the shop, I was told there was no way to access it or retrieve the data. 

Upon having the drive returned to me, I felt that it seemed to weigh a bit more than it did when I initially sent it out. I purchased the exact same drive (Except in black) and noticed that there was indeed a noticeable weight difference between the two drives. Furthermore, when I look inside the drives and take off the usb adapters ([like so](http://i.imgur.com/Ps2hJ27.png)), the number of ""teeth"" on the visible part of the returned hard drive is different from the number of ""teeth"" on the newly purchased one.

The silver usb that seems dodgy has 7 teeth, whereas the drive that I just purchased only has 6. In addition to the tooth variance, there are other noticeable cosmetic differences.

However, both drives share the same model number (SRD0SP0). The PN for them is the same except for a difference of one digit. Old Silver is 1D8AP9-500 while New Black is 1D8AP8-500. I'm assuming (I may be wrong) that the the 8/9 thing denotates the difference in color only. 

**TL;DR :: Here's where you come in. If you have the silver version of the drive, can you take a peek inside and tell me how many teeth are on your drive? In order to do this, take off the usb adapter. Hold the drive so that the text saying ""USM"" is upside down and also on your left. Directly in the slot where the male end of the adapter goes in, you should find the teeth. Please tell me how many you see in there!**

I just want another way to check if my drive is ""normal"" or not. After having it taken in to repairs, I found out that it might be covered under another warranty that I forgot I had purchased. However, I don't want to get in trouble by sending in a completely different drive that just happens to be in the correct enclosure. If you can help me you are utterly and irrevocably awesome.

Its model number is PSAANC-VA505C. I've had it since 2007*, when my Mom bought it for me used from London Drugs. It was great for junior high/high school when I didn't really need to bring it with me anywhere, but university has been a bit tough. 

[here's](http://www.toshiba.ca/web/product.grp?lg=en&amp;section=1&amp;group=223&amp;product=5611&amp;part=6098#spectop) some specifications about my laptop from Toshiba Canada's website.

My main problems with my Satellite A100:

--battery has basically been useless for the last 3 years at least (only lasts for about 20 min unplugged, which sucks in a university without many convenient plugs for my power cord)

--battery is pretty hard to find online, and I don't know where to go to get a new one.

--hard drive space is pretty small for the amount of space I need for school work, pictures, music and programs. (I do have an external hard drive, but it requires manual back up and I'm paranoid of missing something important and then losing it somehow)

--it's heavy. According to the link I have earlier in this post, it weighs roughly 6lb, but I find that hard to believe.

-- even though I'm Canadian, the French-Canadian keyboard really bugs me. I've never had to use it, can only turn it to French by accident and then can't figure out how to switch it back without restarting the computer.

the rest of the problems are pretty trivial and easy to deal with, but the battery, hard drive and weight are really starting to get on my nerves.

The reason I haven't given up on my computer yet is because I'm typically of the belief that I should use something until I absolutely can't use it any more. I'm amazed this computer has lasted as long as it has. I used to have a really old laptop before this, which I used until it started giving me the blue screen of death all the time (luckily the Satellite A100 hasn't... yet?).

*I only guess 2007 because that's the earliest year I can find as the save date of any program or document on my computer. It's older than that though - I found some programs installed by the previous owner that neither I nor my Mom would've installed on it that dated to 2006 IIRC.

**TL;DR** I've managed to use my computer for ~5 or 6 years, but the gal is starting to show her age and I'm wondering whether I should ""send her to the farm to play in the fields"" and replace her, or just keep swapping parts until it completely dies on me.

Sorry for the long post! Any advice is appreciated!

- HD has to be bigger than 100gb
- Cannot be a dell due to legacy drivers
- Cannot be ugly 
- Has to be full size, no SFF/USFF
- Has to be on eBay, or not a very rare computer
- Can be a server
- Isn't compulsory for it to have a pre-installed operating system

Thinking it might be RAM I replaced that, then I RMAd my Motherboard. Now I am in the process of trying to RMA the GPU itself. 

I placed the RMA request with Zotac requesting an advanced replacement of the GPU so I wouldn't be without a computer for a week or so. The next day I got an auto generated response with instructions to send the card back to them (At my expense) for them to receive and then send me out a replacement.

Assuming this was just the system working on it's own and that they hadn't noticed my request I called today and spoke with a customer service rep. I asked him if they would offer me an advanced replacement and was rudely told no. I then asked if they would at least provide me a shipping label to return the card to them. At this point he started talking to someone else about my request and then came back and told me no again rudely. I then asked if I could speak with his manager because I haven't dealt with a company that hasn't provided AT LEAST a shipping label to return defective products. He then goes back to talking to someone else for a moment and comes back claiming his manager was 'busy' and could not talk. I said thank you and ended the call after this.

Several hours later I call back and speak to someone else named Brian. He isn't as rude, but coldly tells me that Zotac policy keeps him from helping me any further. I thank him for his time and end the call. 

At this point I have made up my mind that I will not be buying nor suggesting Zotact products to anyone else if this is how they treat their customers. I have handled RMAs with several big electronics companies like ASUS, MSI, Corsair, Kingston, HP, Lenovo, and I'm sure more. Not ONCE have I ever been treated rudely or been asked to cover the cost of returning a defective product. I don't think I'm off base in saying that this if very poor customer service and not how a company should treat it's patrons.

first off, I know very little about computers. 
I'm looking to buy a gaming computer that can handle games with modern graphics and stuff, like skyrim or WoW. 

What would be the optimal, and minimal specs for such a computer?
 I look on craigslist and they list numbers like 
""2.5 GHz Dual Power Pc Processors"", and
""4 GB Ram"". I don't really know what this means, or if it's good or bad.

I would be satisfied with a computer that can run games with minimal graphics settings, everything turned all the way down. However, I'd rather something better. Just don't know how to look.

If this is a stupid question, then I'm an idiot. Sorry.

I am going to start streaming my LOL games so I am buying a new computer. I am deciding between these two SSD hard drives. Please help me decide which is better.

512GB RAID 0 (256GB Solid State Drive SATA + 256GB mSATA)

256GB RAID 1 (256GB Solid State Drive SATA + 256GB mSATA) 



For those who are interested... this is my laptop configuration. Please let me know where I should upgrade or downgrade.



PROCESSOR	3rd Generation Intel® Core™ i7-3630QM (6MB Cache, up to 3.4GHz w/ Turbo Boost 2.0)	

OPERATING SYSTEM	Windows® 7 Home Premium, 64bit	

MEMORY	12GB (1 X 4GB, 1 X 8GB) Dual Channel DDR3 at 1600MHz	

HARD DRIVE	512GB RAID 0 (256GB Solid State Drive SATA + 256GB mSATA)	

VIDEO CARD	1 GB GDDR5 NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 650M with Optimus™	

LCD PANEL	14.0"" High Def (720p/1366x768) with WLED backlight	

WIRELESS CARDS	Killer Wireless-N 1202 a/g/n 2x2 MIMO for Gaming &amp; Video and Bluetooth 4.0	


UPDATE: Thank you all for taking the time to give me excellent answers. I ended up buying the 256GB SSD SATA 6Gb/s hardrive and downgrading to 8gb of memory. The computer was so expensive so I couldn't afford to increase the video card or lcd panel. I think this will be a great gaming computer. If you want, check out my stream in the future... BlondeSalsa is my username. Then you will see if the computer specs worked to give me a smooth stream :)







The Result: 


The Good: Gaming is great on this computer. There is no lag, the performance is excellent.


The Bad: The screen looked washed out and I compared it with my MAC that has rich colors, this just looked like there was a white mist over the screen. Adjusting the colors did not help so far. Secondly my volume keys do not work, so unless I can figure out a way to fix that I will be sending it back to be repaired.

I put in a new power supply as a prayer, but no luck.

Is there anything else I can do aside from just buying a new tower?  It's an I7 processor..  can I just put it on a new motherboard, toss it in the box and be good to go?  Is my processor most likely fried as well?

I could replace the tower with an i5 tower from frys for like $600.  My power supply, ram and video card can all be transplanted.  I'd like to not have to go the holiday weekend without my computer, so buying one isn't out of the question, but i'd sure like to save some money.

Okay so I felt that and Ivy bridge i5 is a better value than the i7 for the value so id like some opinions on that. 

Both the i5 and i7 Ivy bridge have the same socket 1155 so I was wondering which chipset would be best for the things I want to put in that so I will list those throughout the post and give me an opinion on the end
so now that I have said which processor I want I was wondering about my graphics card(s)

I was wondering if I should get 2 gtx 560 ti 2GB or 1 gtx 660 ti 2GB
and to further that which nvidia manufacturer is the best because Ive heard asus makes good parts and that evga is good for nvidia and for that I will need to make sure that i have a PCI exp 16 3.0 for the 660 or 2 2.0s for the 560s

If there are more things i should consider please tell me

for memory I have no idea about manufacturers and quality 
I just want fast memory thats going to probably be 240 pin ddr3 (seeming from the motherboards i am looking at) so can someone explain to me what the numbers on the memory mean. 
for example the 1600 in DDR3 1600. Is that the speed in Megahertz?
I want 16GB of it so I had some questions about whether to get 2 modules of 4 or 2 of 8 and what on a motherboard indicates which is the preferred method.
Which brands are best also?

So now when it comes to storage I want an SSD to be my primary boot drive so i am thinking 256gb. can someone explain how to pick and SSD and what things there are to consider when doing so.

for mass storage ill probably want 2TB of HDD so i dont think that is very difficult cause ill either go  for a 7200rpm or 10000rpm with alot of cache memory.

when it comes to power supplies, I am also lost because I don't know which brands are best and how the wiring goes (meaning how to know how many power connections it support and how it fits. also is a case with a top power supply better or worse than a case where the power supply goes at the bottom.

some other things that i have going into this are obviously the wireless card which i think ill just take from my current desktop PCI express x1

i also have a capture card which is also pci express x1

i was thinking about a sound card but idk if that is necessary so can I get an opinion on that.

obviously this thing will probably have usb 3.0 because the ivy bridge supporting motherboards have it

I was thinking full tower case because the air circulation will be important and I probably dont need any liquid cooling because i dont plan on overclocking b/c 3.4 GHz is pretty good.
so I think that covers it

If anyone has a suggestion on a full tower case please send me a link

This backup will include all of the updates and drivers necessary for the system, but I would also like it to include a few extras.

For example, I have fallen in love with the Google Chrome browser. It is definitely making it's way onto the backup. Other software includes:

* Steam
* Ventrilo
* Pidgin
* VLC
* AutoHotKey
* Antivirus Software

These are my day-to-day apps. I'm thinking that there might be some uninstallation software that I'll look into before installing other things that will likely do no more than collect dust.

* How important is the quality of the battery to computer performance? 
* How bad would it be to use a $60 battery compared to a $150 battery? 
* What types of risks are involved with a cheap battery, is it just low battery life? How low?

I am typing this because I am tired of the backpack. I want to put the laptop in the pannier but I am afraid of damaging it.

First off, the last time I put RAM into a computer it was probably 1997 and it was a Celeron.  Commence laughing now.

I'll wait....

Is the pointing necessary?...

Done? ... Ok, good, anyway...

I've been messing around a lot recently with virtual machines and started looking into the possibility of upgrading my machines RAM.  Looking at the [system properties](http://i.imgur.com/9U7Cc.png) confused me, and [opening my machine](http://i.imgur.com/VHEaV.jpg) left we bewildered because the instant I surpassed 30 years of age, I lost touched with the world.  I have all but forgotten how to read and write.

Anyway, here's my idiot questions.  How the hell much RAM do I have?  2.75 gigs?  I didn't think you could do that, I thought it had to be divisible by 2 or something.  Why does it say 2.75?

According to the internet, which I coincidently believe everything it says, I have a Dell XPS 630.  I bought this computer around two years ago because when asked what my system specifications were, I responded with ""I would like a computer, that when I request that it does something, it responds by accomplishing said task"".

So internet, I'm asking you questions again.

How much RAM do I have?
How much can I put in this damn thing?
What and where do I buy it?
In terms of the actual purchase, I'd prefer to fork over as few of my antiquated [Confederate Dollars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America_dollar) as possible.

Edit: Problem solved! The first thing I tried when I ran into this problem was turning off the computer and restarting it. It didn't make a difference.

Then it started lagging and freezing and it would get the BSoD at least once a day. I didn't think about the core temp, although it has always had the habit of getting a little toasty. Anyway, I purchased Driver Reviver, because I researched and it said the BSoD could be caused by outdated drivers and low and behold, I had 11 out of date drivers. So, I've got that issue fixed. Now, my laptop has been freezing *at least* once a day. Today it froze around 4 times (not BSoD, but just the entire screen freezing and I have to force reboot it). Now, this all did happen when I was gaming and tho PC was quite hot. So, I let it cool down to it's normal temp. I have just been browsing the internet (reddit mostly) and right now I have 3 programs open: Chrome(5 tabs), Skype for Desktop, and Core Temp 1.0. Spybot, Driver Reviver, Google Drive, and Avast! are running in the background. 

According to Core Temp, my laptop is currently at around 127F (53C) for #1 and #2. Is it normal to be that high? It doesn't feel that hot on my lap. As sleek as this Aspire is, the fan placement is very poor. There is a 2.5 inch slotted opening on the left side of the computer and that is it, so I wouldn't imagine it is getting very much airflow.

Anyway...is this normal? Are there solutions? I will be back after gaming for a bit. Gonna try and push it to the point offreeze up so I can get an accurate reading. Thanks in advance, guys!

**EDIT**: Gamed for a few hours and it did not freeze, but the temperature, at it's hottest, got up to 171F (77C). I think it didn't get super duper hot because I wasn't running it in full screen because I wanted to monitor the temp.

Basically it comes down to an error while fusing files using a program called Avid Liquid 7 (by Pinnacle. Yes, I know it's a complete and utter piece of shit, but it's what they use at the office).  An export dialog comes up after you begin the fuse, will hang on 3% occasionally, but finish writing the file.  The file will be about 1/70th the size it should be.

Now the interesting part.

I go to windows explorer and navigate to the folder they are in, put them in details view and see the file sizes. I notice the small sized files, but after a few seconds, the window freezes and windows explorer crashes. This is odd. It happens every time I go to look at the file.  Not just in explorer, mind you, but any file choosing dialog in any program will crash when it encounters the file in the folder.

The problem is easily fixed by re-rendering the video, but I'm still a bit fascinated by this behavior, and would love a little light shed on it.

Details inside.",ihrtgngr,5,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/computers/comments/1g2tr8/computer_whizzes_help_a_lady_out_laptop_fell_from/,"Ok, I have a three-ish year old Dell Inspiron N5010 (no longer under warranty).  It fell from a height of about 3 feet last week when my cat jumped on it while I had it poorly balanced. It was on, and I picked it up and kept working (Netflix didn't even skip a beat). Then about an hour later, the screen went dark, but I could still hear sound so I thought maybe one of the cables to the screen had come loose. I first tried rebooting it, and upon doing so, it seemed caught in an endless loop of wanting to run startup repair and getting a note from windows boot manger saying that a drive has failed, and then trying to launch startup repair again. Skipping the startup repair leads to a quick blue screen of death image before it just dies. At one point it got all the way to disk check, but that ran all night and wasn't finished when I woke up, so that doesn't seem good. 

Fast forward three days: I work at a university and I've had our department IT look at it, and I don't 100% understand what he says to me, but here's the situation as far as I can tell: he had me run diagnostics at start up and I was given the code ""0F00:1332, Disk-Block 1536 FAIL, interrupt request did not set in time"". Google tells me that can indicate a hard drive disk failure (or that the hdd is dying). At one point, we also saw the code 2000-0146, which again I think is something to do with a failing hdd. I've taken the computer apart and there doesn't appear to be any loose cables or anything, and I reseated the hdd. No luck. We took the hdd out and tried to mount it externally to another computer, but it can only find the recovery drive (which apparently has nothing on it?). I have pictures and music from the last year since I backed up that I would really like to save from the hdd if possible. 

So, the other big question: is it just the hdd or are there more problems? Do I need a new computer? He had me put in a used, but functional hdd that he had lying around, and when I turn the computer on, all I see is one line of some weird ass characters. I'd like to try to install an OS before buying a new hdd so that if there are worse problems, I don't waste money. But the ""new"" hdd doesn't see the Windows 7 disc we gave it. He also said something about trying to run diagnostics with the ""new"" hdd, but that the computer just shuts off in the middle.

Now I'm at a loss. Our IT guy is busy and this is unimportant to him, but I'm not ready to give up. I'm relatively computer saavy, and am willing to try just about anything (cheaply).  I'm going to put my potentially broken hdd in the freezer overnight to see if that does any good, but I thought maybe Reddit could help. I'll answer any questions that you've got to help you narrow down the problem. Please help!!!!

And it has the option of glossy or matte replacement screens. Now I would love to have the matte screen but I have heard 50/50 reviews on them. What are your guys's preferences for gaming? And has anyone done one of these swaps? For 60 bucks im not too hesitant to try.
Another thing I dislike (and maybe its the same for all laptops, not just a glossy screen) but due to the backlight when playing a ""dark game"", the dark areas (a shadow for example) will have a white glow to it due to the backlight of the screen. I hope that makes sense. The dark areas glare white due to the laptops backlight. Would a matte screen resolve this issue? I find it very annoying, too much contrast I suppose you could call it.

Hello,

This morning my Acer Aspire 5251-1513 was working just fine but I left it unplugged and it went into sleep mode after I left it unattended for about 15 minutes (I have done this hundreds on times with no issues) but today when I went to start it up (while plugged into the power supply), it was a black screen and the LED HDD/wifi lights would not flash like usual.

The computer starts up and the fan spins but the HDD/WIFI lights no longer come on and neither does the screen, while the LED power button lights up and the DVD drive works.

I connected the vga output to another monitor and all I got was a blank screen, no output signal detected.

----------------------------------------------------

I already tried this method,

&gt;Remove the battery and charger/ac adapter/power cord from your Acer 5251-1513 laptop, press and hold the power button for 10 seconds to discharge any residual current inside the laptop. It functions like a complete reset. Replace the battery and charger/ac adapter/power cord and turn your Acer 5251-1513 laptop on.

I also tried to take out the battery and power supply and hold the power button for 60 seconds.

Both did not work.

The power supply/cord is working just fine and so is the battery so I doubt that those are the problems.

I have a Line 6 Spider IV 75 amp with a line out, and I have a 3.5mm aux cable for it, and I want to know if they are compatible.
