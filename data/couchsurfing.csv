A surfer was like a really helpful new flatmate or an instant best friend who was always up for hanging out.  We would cook together, drink, listen to music, talk long into the night, and go out around town, irrespective of whether my guests were a couple, the same sex or the opposite sex.  If there was an exchange going on - their company for my couch - it was unspoken, uncalculated and without cynicism. 

I understand the old site was unwieldy and needed improvement.   But I can't see how any of the recent changes could facilitate more positive experiences for any host or surfer.   Couchsurfing is being destroyed in the promise of one day being rebuilt.

The city groups have been replaced by low-content place pages, swamped with couch requests and meet-up requests.    Most self-respecting locals have lost any interest in posting.    

The main way surfers find a couch seems to now be the Open Couch Request system, where they put up a request and wait for hosts to approach them.  Surfers are now encouraged to shout their needs into the void, without putting any thought into why they would want to stay with a particular host.  

There is no longer any way to inform new members what the site should be about, because management themselves either don't know or don't care. Trying to make a positive contribution seems to be discouraged anyway.  The Couchsurfing management have deleted all the user-created content, such as the Wikis, the community guidelines, the New Members Welcome Group.  

The Couchsurfing userbase includes software professionals, web designers, user experience architects, travel industry experts, and others who have given detailed and well-intentioned feedback on how to improve the site or at least halt its destruction.  The response from Couchsurfing is to ignore them, delete their posts, then ban them. They've also taken down the Zendesk support forums and closed the Ambassadors (Public) group.   

I can't understand why the Couchsurfing management is choosing to destroy the site.   Is it simply ineptitude?   Here's what their employees think:  http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CouchSurfing-Reviews-E568573.htm

CS management likely see the current dissatisfied members as having reached the end of their 'customer life cycle', and have made the calculation that the influx of new members will continue at such a rate, that they can lose 10,000 deeply committed members and still have a valuable site.   

Perhaps they are right.   Couchsurfing has certainly long since reached critical mass, so many waves of new members will join without caring what has gone before.   There will always be people looking for free accommodation when they travel.  But where will the hosts come from?

Yesterday I made a whiny post in this subreddit about not being sure if CS is the right thing for me. Luckily there was a local meetup today and a perfect opportunity for me to kind of test things out.

It was amazing. 

There were 15-20 people from all over the world. I talked to a Brazilian guy about soccer, impressed a girl from Estonia with my vexillological knowledge, counted to ten in French in front of a French guy and had a great and long-lasting conversation with a very friendly guy from India.

I am from Germany, but the de-facto language of the meetup was English, which was very refreshing to me and gave the whole thing another international flair. I rarely have the opportunity to actually speak English and was kind of surprised how easy the words came out of my mouth. I even had to convince another German guy that I'm not a native English speaker, which was very flattering. :3

So I was hosting a girl who, at odd times of the night, would wake up and walk around the place. She was sharing a bed with another surfer, while I was on the couch. Sometime in the middle of the night, I opened my eyes to see her looking over me, in the darkness. I squealed like a little girl. She hushed me, said it was okay, and then went back to sleep.

The next morning, while I was at work, I got a call from my landlord who wanted to know who was staying at my place. I said she was a friend, to which the landlord replied that ""my friend"" was going around knocking neighbors doors ""to get to know them"".

I asked her about this, and she said my neighbors were rude and that I should move out and live with nicer people. That night, she did the same walking-around thing at night, typing on her iPad. I pretended it was okay, but it was kinda unsettling.

The next day, again at work, I got a text from the landlord asking me to move out. I tried to talk to my surfer but all she said was ""They're horrible people, and you should move out"". I asked her to leave. She found a hostel, and I collected the keys to my apartment from the receptionist (well after she left, because I didn't want to face her).

A few days later, I got a letter from the landlord to move out or face the consequences of ""sub-letting"" and ""disrupting peace"". A week later, I was out on the streets. To this day I don't know *what* she did.

Don't get me wrong: I think couchsurfing is awesome, and you can have incredible fun hosting and surfing, but it's inevitable that you get a fair share of crazies. Good or bad.

It normally goes well, but our experience this summer has completely turned us away from the idea, we're done.  Below is a list of surfers we've dealt with so far this year.  Nothing is embellished, I'm actually leaving a few things out because it got so long...

*""Hi I'm traveling to (insert national park) and need a place to stay for a night.""*  Turns out, he lives in this town, and his parents just threw him out (he's 26).  No biggie, we would have let him stay anyway, but he chose to lie, on his profile and directly to us.  He showed up with no car, no food, no money, and no means to acquire any of those things (no job or desire to work).  His only conversation was ranting about how unfair the world is (e.g. his parents).  He smelled horrible, but refused a shower or to do laundry.  Had to air the room out after he left.  When he finally did leave (asked him to after three days) we stupidly gave him a few bucks and a free hotel stay that we had acquired with frequent traveler miles.  Once he had the cash in hand, he asked us to stop at a gas station (of course we were his taxi) where he spent the money on beer.  *“Thanks, see ya!”*  And he walked off into the night.

Next, was a lady from Iceland.  ""*Can you pick me up at the airport?*""  Okay, what time?  ""*Midnight, on Tuesday.*""  Yikes, well, okay.  Confirm her request, then, another email.  ""*Can you also give me a ride to a place 150 miles away, after I stay the night? We'll need to leave at 6AM*""  No, sorry. *""Please! Why not?""*  Our car needs work, and we both have jobs.  *""I'll pray for your car and it will not fail. Please!""*  Again, no, I can drive you to the bus station.  Third email about the ride *“Please, I pray for your car.”*  Still say no.  Okay, maybe something is lost in translation here, give her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she's not crazy.  The day of her stay arrives, go to the airport to pick her up *""Oh, these people are giving me a ride because you said no, I don't need a place to stay now either, thanks, goodbye.""*  Walks away.

Number three made arrangements to stay with us a month in advance, called the day before she was supposed to arrive *""I got a hotel, thanks anyway.""*

Number four did similar, but never called or replied to our inquiries, nothing.

Number five, oh boy, this one sealed the deal.  She just left this morning.  Her request said *""I'm a writer on my way to a convention.""*  Cool, her reviews are all good, she's welcome to stay.  The day of her arrival *""Oh hey, I forgot to tell you, I travel with a bird.""*  Well, we have cats (stated on our profile), so that's going to be a problem. *""No it won't, I promise, just give me directions.""*  Okay, I guess you know what you're doing, here are (detailed) directions, along with our address.  Later *""Hello?  I'm lost, I am traveling down (wrong road) because some random person said I should, I ignored what you told me.  Just tell me how to get there, I am really good with directions.""*  An hour later (she was 15 minutes away last we spoke) *""I'm lost.""*  Stand out on the road to flag her down, she drives past me, twice.  When she does see me, first thing she does is roll down her window and shout *""Well it would have been nice if you'd told me your address.""*

Turns out, she's not a writer, never was.   She's unemployed.  The bird squawks and tries to bite anyone that goes near it.  The woman is covered in bird shit, it's even in her hair.  Dinner time.  *”Let me cook, I'm a gourmet chef.”* Proceeds to destroy our kitchen.  Cooks packaged food, uses every dish and utensil for a one skillet meal.  Every surface in the kitchen is filthy, not counting the bird shit.  Eats dinner with the bird, lets it eat chewed food out of her mouth, lovely sight for the rest of us. Bird shit on the table, shit on the floor, shit on the couch, shit on the rugs, shit on the carpet; same with bird food.  She ignores it all, every mess is invisible to her.  Bed time *""Can I get an extra blanket, it's cold""*  It's July, and you already have three blankets, but okay, here's a down comforter, it's all we have left.  Bird shit all over it, shit on the pillows, shit on the blankets, shit on the bed frame, shit on the curtains, shit on the carpet.

Next day, she wakes up before us and goes to a nearby national park with some motorcycle dude she just met.  Leaves the bird in the bedroom.  But first, she walks all over the house with muddy shoes on.  Carpet, rugs, and tile now have mud *and* bird shit on them.  We don't wear shoes in the house, it's obvious to all but her.  The bird squawks all day, LOUD, wakes us up minutes after she leaves.  Shits everywhere in the spare room, attacks if I open the door.  At least the cats are entertained.  She returns last night at 10, me and my SO were in bed (we have jobs).  She is drunk and invites her boy-toy in.  We wake up to their giggly snuggle session on our couch, we are clearly not happy, she tries to lighten the situation with introductions, she can't remember his name.  We tell her this is not cool, she says *“I told you he was dropping me off, it should have been clear to you that he was coming in.”* Tries to play the he said / she said game with me and my SO, like we're idiots who don't communicate with one another.  When that fails, she silently departs while we're are in another room.  Forgets half of her belongings, calls this morning to come get them.  I am working, but okay, when?  *“A half hour from now.”*  Go home and wait.  She arrives an hour and a half later, muddy shoes again.

Eternal couchtember.

Thanks for reading my rant, had to do something to vent because I am absolutely floored after this last surfer.

How about we focus on general questions, exchanging experiences, discussing questions of beginners, rather than posting very specific local request that, in my opinion, have a very small chance of being answered and only concern a very small part of this community (meaning the people looking for hosts and the potential hosts). 
I completely understand that it is difficult to find a host sometimes, and that in such a situation you try to use all channels (like this sub), still I believe that the posts are, as I said, only relevant for a small amount of people. 
I don't want to offend anyone, it's just a suggestion to improve this sub. 
If you are a situation, where it seems difficult to find a host, try posting in the last minute group (many cities have that, [like this one](https://www.couchsurfing.org/group.html?gid=20026)).

This *alleged* upgrade has made the site more difficult to navigate; continues to be rife with geographic errors; erased years and years worth of invaluable community-generated data in the Community Guidelines; created a generic forum vulnerable to a flood of spam and generic couch requests; gave far too much prominence to the already questionable Open Couch Requests feature (where predators -- many with zero information in their profiles -- ""pick and choose"" the most attractive female visitors to solicit); required Moderators to ""flag"" any couch requests or off-topic threads not related directly to the specific ""Place"" (a stark contrast to the original ""freedom of speech"" policy, which enforced personal accountability for anything you might say); and by default made every post on the Place pages (as well as Activities) available to public viewing via any search engine. (Hope you didn't post any phone numbers or addresses there or in any of the Activities!)


Also, in that time any member can now join the site without any verification whatsoever (you can even do so with a fake e-mail address!); Community Details, a feature given to Moderators after many passionate pleas to provide pertinent information to those visiting a Place page, were quickly taken away without a better alternative to replace them; the Zendesk forum where thousands of public posts featuring helpful suggestions re: recent site updates are now hidden from the public; and the memberships of two proactive and outspoken Ambassadors -- myself, Justin Holt (Chicago), and Don Shine (Berlin) -- were terminated without warning, and with no justification offered ""due to matters of privacy"".


Sam Houston, Colleen Sanders, Merci Victoria Grace and Bill Loundy -- all CS employees whose positions supposedly entail representing the CS communities worldwide -- have spent these last 90 days ignoring our helpful suggestions (which they originally asked for); have become even more evasive (when they promised clarity and transparency) and increasingly hostile (see: Beta Team blacklistings, membership terminations); continue to burden us with a feature that disbanded our communities and made the site less safe and more difficult to navigate (i.e. Place pages); and still refuse to engage us in a courteous and professional manner.


If you or I were hired for **ANY** paid position and after 90 days still showed absolutely zero competence to fulfill the most basic duties of said position, we would be fired on the spot. Well, it's time that the CouchSurfing corporate officers as well as their investors know the level of incompetence that takes place inside their base of operations.


We've caused quite a stir so far, but we're nowhere near where we need to be for CS HQ to finally address our grievances in a clear and professional manner.  **That's why we need your help.** Please, even if you think it's a lost cause, a few choice comments in recent articles and tweets to news sources can make a helluva difference. Who knows? If enough people raise a fuss, maybe can reclaim some semblance of the CouchSurfing that we used to know -- at least for a bit longer.

He crashed (pun intended) with us for a week and he was a super chill guy. He was definitely an alcoholic and had to have his two shots of whiskey with his coffee in the morning. He had a fellow traveler with him that didn't talk much and had never been west of the Mississippi so he was just taking it all in. Crash had traveled the country multiple times and was a Rainbow Gathering attendee and made an income from intricate hemp necklaces, bracelets, lighter wraps, etc...

He is, to this day, the only person that has vouched for me on couch surfing. So we got along, had a good time. Then he left and we both left our respective positive referrals and that was that.

Fast forward a year (present), I'm living with my same roommate from last year but we live another state away. The first city had about a million people in it. Now we live in a city with about eight million people in it. 

My coworker works as a door to door window salesman and one of his coworkers within basic carpool small talk told him he had a friend that had been shot and killed. His coworker said his name was Crash. And my roommate, confused and astonished, asked ""Which Crash?"" 

Well, how many people go by Crash? They finally put all the pieces together to figure out that it was in fact the same guy. 

Crash apparently had a warrant out for his arrest in the city we live in and had gotten caught by the police for something basic (drinking in public, most likely). He served his two days in jail then the cops went to take him to where he was staying (a park, couch surfing host [maybe?]). The cop exited his patrol car, and Crash thought it would be a good idea to steal it and drive off. Crash did in fact steal the car, then drove a couple hundred feet and tried to run over the cop (maybe leaving Dunkin Donuts). The cop, like any armed person would, drew his gun and fired striking Crash in the chest with a fatal shot.

I stayed two nights, everything was basically fine and dandy at first, we made some sweet fijitas and watched a movie.

""OK"", I thought, ""he's just tired of hanging around non-western people and has to bottle this stuff up, so it's coming out here"". We had a nice evening shooting pool with some locals and I forgot about it. Then, in the middle of night, I feel his hand on my side.

I was really skeptical about planning a trip to Eastern Europe exclusively couch surfing due to all the hate speech towards the state of the website today, and people vowing never to use CS again, ect. I posted a thread a while back on the subject, and I was basically told that the community was still *surviving*, but who knows for how long. I decided it was good enough and am a week in, and gosh darn has it been amazing. In Olomouc, CZ I was hosted by one of the most intelligent, caring people I've ever met. We had hours and hours of conversation about the US, Czech republic, and everything in between. After only a day and a half we left very good friends. In Wroclaw, Poland, I was hosted in the dorms of the Technical University by a very cheery and friendly student. I got to drink Polish vodka in the communal kitchen with tons of university students and talk with them about Polish culture and the attitude of the younger generation. A few days later I was hosted by an awesome Belorussian student who escaped their Totalitarianism, and I had many a fascinating conversation with him and his Russian girlfriend about everything East-Slavic. They really treated me as an honored guest, they wouldn't even let me help with dishes, ect...
So I don't know, maybe I just want somewhere to vent my exctaticism. But I thought this would help those of you who are jaded with the CS project to remember that the community is *still* there, and it's *still* amazing. I can't say if it's as amazing as ever, but don't know how it could've been any better.

His references are good (15+ positive) and he comes across as clever and a nice guy. 

Well, since arriving i feel totally uncomfortable and like im walking on eggshells. it turns out that hes not worked since last year, the partner is long gone, and instead his 4yo son (!!) is living with him. They spend the whole time chatting in Hungarian, and whenever i try to make conversation i feel like im irritating him/hes not really listening. Also, within the first half an hour hes mentioned about how hes slept with female surfers in the past and how easy it is for young solo females to get places. I try to maintain eye contact and i notice he keeps glancing down my body which is making me feel uncomfortable. Its not pleasant to chat to him because whatever i have to say he seems to disagree with too which is straining. (e.g. ""its been easy so far since everyone seems to speaks English""...""no, they dont."")

He offered me dinner which i accepted (i brought him alcohol as a gift btw), and he made himself a big meal and just gave me some bread which i felt super akward about. All the while his kid is screaching and doesnt speak english so i cant play with him or anything. When he tookt he kid to bed at 9pm i hid in my bedroom and it sounded like hed gone to bed too, i realised he'd gotten up at 10:30 but by then i was in my sleeping clothes and in bed so we didnt say goodnight. 

In the morning i wake up early and tell him im going to explore, and he gave me a spare key which was nice. I came back at 6pm and actually had my hand hovering over the door absolutely dreading putting the key in and going inside. Hes not in which is a bit of a relief. 

Anyway, im worried that he thinks that im just treating his house like a hotel, since im spending a lot of time ""hiding"" in my room. When i inspect the references, it comes across as maybe people have had the same experience as me, e.g. someone says hes direct and honest, which is a strange choice of words. 

Ive booked into a hostel for the next few nights, so i just need to survive one more night. I guess this is just a warning to people to scrutinise references and see whats potentially under the surface of them and a chance for me to vent. Its such a shame since the last 3 people i have stayed with on this trip have been super and i'd even consider one a close friend!

EDIT: After reading that over i realised just how uncomfortable i was so i noped the hell out of there. Left a note with his key explaining that i wasnt well and booked into a hostel so i wouldnt disturb him. I arrived at a hostel and made friends with a Russian girl, and we went out for dinner straight after meeting it was great! Much better than hiding in a strange bedroom willing the night to end!

So many people just see it as another form of social networking, which it absolutely isn't meant to be.
The majority of messages I get now are from guys wanting to hook up. In the past, I would host male travellers, but now I just can't be bothered because of the amount of creeps I have encountered. It's all a bit disheartening.

I have been hosting for a few weeks now and have taken in a few  surfers so far. The first one I took in was a woman that was absolutely stunning. Beauty, brains, personality, the whole shebang. Over the course of hosting her, I admit... I began to fall for her. To complicate things, she had a boyfriend back home. As a respectful host, I chose not to overstep the boundaries of being a solid host and didn't make a move. All the while we would go out and do stuff all the time, while in everyone else's eyes, we were a couple. It felt great.

Eventually her time with me ran out and she skipped town. It has been a few weeks since I last seen her and I catch myself thinking about her from time to time. A strange sadness creeps up on me. The feeling like when a good friend moves away. I do enjoy hosting. In fact it is amazing. 

In the following surfers that I hosted, the similar feeling is apparent. Guys, girls, couples... they all have the same effect. The sense of loss. Making a connection then breaking it off.

I would like to hear some of your thoughts/stories.

They can delete as many posts as they like, but since Couchsurfing staff are just 9-5ers they won't be able to stop every post. 

Complaints are spreading over every external news article on Couchsurfing too. This is becoming an increasingly public problem for them.

So they should appoint to their PR team somebody European, plainspeaking and honest, to attempt to rebuild trust.

I'm trying my best to craft a successful little modern-day love story here!

I met Kelly in Laos. We fell for each other immediately. We spent some beautiful time together in south-east Asia, but sadly she had to go home to London. She made me promise to come to London to find her. Unbeknownst to her, I've kept that promise. We've skyped every other night since parting ways, even through a [rather epic charity bike ride I did](http://cyclingagainstslavery.tumblr.com). I've led her to believe I'm undertaking three months of volunteering in Cambodia, but really I'm in KL killing time until my flight to London... this Saturday! 

I'm hoping some of you might like to help out with this romantic little story. I might need a host or two, or some London transport advice, or some help planning my surprise arrival! Who's in? 

[My CS profile](http://couchsurfing.org/people/northonm31)

And [photo evidence](http://a1.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/314573_10150323452483970_509463969_8310731_1412877603_n.jpg) of me and the gorgeous girl I'd follow anywhere.

*UPDATE*

I got refused entry at immigration. Yep, it's true. I got refused entry. I'm absolutely devastated. After spending three days straight on the internet in KL trying to make sure I had EVERY box ticked for a non-visa tourist entry (which is open to Australians) it turns out not every box was in fact ticked, and Australians are always first to be targeted at Stansted - and in the words of the (pretty nasty) immigration officer I dealt with: ""The Border Agency website is designed to confuse more than it is to inform"". It was also nice to hear some subjective (and completely inaccurate) negative character judgements from him as a final kick in the guts before the refusal, too. Bitter old bastard. 

The official reason? Because I was arriving to surprise a girl I like, and I had made arrangements to at least investigate the potential to work at some point (which you are allowed to do) - the Immigration Officer (using his ""discretion"") was not satisfied that I would leave the UK when required to do so. It didn't help that I got some bogus advice in KL that a Dublin exit flight would satisfy the exit conditions - turns out it doesn't, so that didn't help my case either.

So, after a 13 hour flight full of optimism and excitement I found myself in an immigration detention holding room for 30 hours without a bed or shower, and then was placed on another 13 hour flight back to KL. The only highlight? The non-governement immigration detention staff at Stansted were absolutely brilliant - they seemed to take a liking to me from the start. They showed me compassion and warmth and were really rooting for me as I awaited my fate. They've made me promise to meet-up with them for a beer when I come back, and even let me have a security jacket to fly home with!

Kelly knows about it now. She's as shattered as I am. I'm now back in Australia, flat-broke, and facing a Christmas without her. I only need about $4,000 to make this work but I'm desperately trying to work out how to raise that as soon as possible.

So here's my deal. I am a chill, normal 22 year old dude. I have great references on my profile and have been known to be a wicked, entertaining host. Thing is tho, I also happen to be dating another dude. We're just moving together and I was wondering how I should go about this. Here are a few additional details: 

- Like I said, I am normal and chill. I am one of those guys that you would never guess are gay, and so is my boyfriend. Unless you're my mother, you would never know about me being into guys unless I told you straight up.

- In the past, before my boyfriend and I lived together, I just wouldn't tell my surfers because, well, it was irrelevant. Many added me to Facebook eventually and might have figured out I was dating a guy (though it's not obvious on Facebook, we just have a lot of random pics my guy and I) and I have never had a problem with it.

Now what I would like to know is this: how should I go about it now? Clearly, my surfers would have to find out. I do sleep in the same bed as my boyfriend, after all. Should I just indicate in my profile that I am dating a guy? Should I just tell people when they send requests? Obviously, I wouldn't accept their request without telling them and wait until they find out by themselves. 

Thanks for your input! :)

I received a private message last week from a girl my age who was visiting my city, and had nothing to do whilst the person she was staying with was at work. 

I agreed to meet her the next day, without even looking fully at her profile. We grabbed a hot chocolate at starbucks, then spent 5 hours walking around aimlessly just talking. I knew we had some things in common from the quick glance I had at her profile, but it soon became apparent that we were pretty much the same person, just with different accents and genitalia. We eventually ended up at the 'beach' in the city centre, where she somehow managed to spill half a bottle of 7up over my crotch.

Despite getting a soaking, I agreed to meet up with her again in a couple of days time. 

We decided to have a picnic at Wolloton park (Wayne Manor in TDKR). So we lay in a field eating random food which you wouldn't consider to be picnic food whilst surrounded by baby deers and with Florence and the Machine belting out of the stereo. Time flew by, and when I looked at my watch we had been there for 9 hours. 

In the 14 hours I spent with her, I feel as I know more about her than half of my friends who I have known for years. She has also inspired me to go back packing around Europe, and I have booked the flights and train tickets in October for a month long trip.

I couldn't of lost my CS virginity to a better person, and I will now participate in events, surfing and hosting with CS as much as I can.

I'm a girl new to CS who's been going to local meetings. To me it just feels like a lot of the male CSers seem to be using CS -- maybe not explicitly -- for additional purposes, which took me by surprise since that's not what CS is about. I'm not saying that they're not interested in the CS project because I am sure they are, but they also have this other goal when they see a girl they like, I think. When I was at the last meeting a guy was pretty intent on getting my phone number and some other guys were flirting with me. I was really confused by what was happening, but I'm starting to think CS must also be a pretty effective dating/hookup tool for some people. When I was surfing in one country, my host had a thing for me which made me SUPER uncomfortable, and I realized that the male/female host/guest thing is not always ideal.

with CS. What do? ",MikeBruski,20,3,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/j5lil/had_a_fucked_up_guest_lucky_to_be_alive/,"Here's the story : I've hosted lots of people at my place, with great passion, and have had amazing times and made amazing friends in some of the people who stayed with me. Sure, some were a bit so-so, but the really awesome ones totally made up for that. 

So, around the time of my birthday last in june, i was supposed to host two chicks from Italy. They wanted to go to Islas Cies in Vigo, and I live in Porto, so i suggested we go together in my car as I also wanted to go and check it out (they had planned to drive there in a rental car). 

We correspond back and forth for weeks before they get here. They are doing a trip of all of Portugal and ending in Porto. So the communication goes fine, until they get here.

First, they refuse to follow my driving instructions that take them right by my house, and instead take a huge detour that costs them 15 euros more in toll and gas, because ""it was easier"". One of them barely speaks english, and the other is a total bitch, but in hiding. What i mean by that is that she's constantly smiling, but it's extremely fake. 
So, everything i suggest, she turns it down. Now, I have a plan for my CS's, and everyone I've hosted (over 80 people) have loved it. They refuse, and want to walk around the city alone instead. I drop them off in the centre at around 11 am (and they are already complaining that it's late and they dont have time), and they call me back at 21 asking to be taken home. Everyday, they want to sleep before 23!

I am a great chef, and everyone loves my traditional portuguese food . They didn't want to try it, and insisted on making their own food, which was cheap supermarket canned stuff... On my birthday, she stresses me from early morning and is generally a total bitch. We have a huge discussion in the supermarket because I want to make them some seafood dishes, and they would rather go to Vigo and spend 15 € on a restaurant there, because ""they know they would like that"". My seafood dishes usually cost 2 euros per person if we buy ingredients in the store, and nobody in their right mind would refuse a great seafood dish for 2€, am I right?

Also, because I host a lot of people, i tell them straight up that I will drive them anywhere they want at anytime, and cook them anything they would like, as long as they pay for gas and they food. Everybody thinks this is a great deal, but she kept arguing about this, and didn't want to fork up gas money to Vigo at first, expecting me to drive them there for free... When we went to the supermarket buying stuff for them to eat, right before we are about to pay, she goes ""oh i forgot something, I'll be right back"".. a minute later i see her on the other side of the check out counters, waiting, obviously expecting me to pay for everything! 

Now, i didn't like them from the moment they got there, but I'm an openminded person, and i wanted to help them, as they were short on cash. But she was disrespectful, rude, controlling and stubborn, bitch, uncooperative, and generally a weird tourist (she later complained that I was talking too much about Porto... which I assume was the reason they came, to learn about it, but oh well). 
What kind of makes this worse is that we communicated for a long time before they came, and i seriously thought we would hit it off well...

The worst part is that on the last day, they insisted on making me dinner (which was horrible), and the bitchy one left the **gas on in the oven for 30 minutes, almost right next to an open flame!!!** How my apartment didn't blow up and kill us all , I have no idea... I once had the gas on for 20 seconds because I couldnt find the lighter to light it, and when I finally did, the fire scorched my forearm and shaved 30cm of hair off, almost all the way to the elbow... 20 seconds, so I can just imagine what 30 minutes would have done. 

Anyway, since then I've hosted 3 people, who i had accepted before the girls came, but I've lost all passion and motivation for CS. I used to host 10-20 people per month, and I'm currently 1½ months without anyone here... 

Anyone ever experience similar situations? And what did you do?

**TL;DR :  I used to host lots of people who all loved it, then one chick was a total disrespectful fake bitch who almost blew up my oven and killed us all. Now I'm disillusioned and lost the passion to host people**

I though about linking to my CS page, so you can read the references others (and her) left me, but i didn't feel like a ""bragging"" thing.. if you feel it's relevant, I'll add a link. I don't care about personal information, my username is my real one anyway, and the one I use on CS too... 


**EDIT** So, I wrote the negative reference. She proceeded to change her reference from Neutral to Positive, deleted the part about my oven, and then, 2 days later, deleted her profile.

I actually quite like this idea.   It should cut down on the total freeloaders, and make surfers more appreciative of their hosts.  (Though there is also the risk that it would make surfers feel they have 'paid' for the couch, so they become more demanding, and treat the host more like a hostel).

It would mean CS on the whole could do a lot of good in the world, by making a lot of charitable donations.   If the amount given to charity is much bigger than the amount taken by CS, it won't feel so much like CS is profiting from host's generosity.

It's a better idea than premium memberships, or advertising, both of which Tony has already discounted.

My name is Sam, this is [me](http://i.imgur.com/gkBzS.jpg) being awkward and saying hi. I'm x-posting this from AskReddit since it didn't get much exposure.

As the title suggests, I'm trying to plan a cross-country (USA) trip and I'm looking for people to host me in certain cities. 

^((I'm new to this sub, so if you think this belongs in another subreddit, let me know!)^)

I'll give the condensed-but-still-kind-of-long version of things, but for a TL;DR, scroll to the end.

So, I'm a guy. I'm 25. I'm from a big, small town in central Pennsylvania. I went to college in RI and left *without* a degree, but *with* heaps of student loan debt. I returned to my hometown and ended up working at the same retail establishment that I left to go to college in the first place. I stayed there for just under two years just trying to get ahead until the company went through a reorganization, eliminated my position and laid me off. So now, I've got nothing but time on my hands until I take the next big step in my life. I never got to travel very much; so now that I have the opportunity, I plan to take a roughly 2 month journey via megabus, greyhound and flying (when I have to) in order to explore this crazy country of ours. 

So, that's what brings me here. I have some friends that I met in college who are spread out across the country and I plan to visit them on this trip, as well as use the resources available on couchsurfing.org (I've had an account on there for a while). But, before I started sending a ton of random people requests for a couch to sleep on - I thought, ""Why not reach out to people that I know I at least have *something* in common with first?"" Makes sense, right? 

If you're still reading this, I can only assume that you're mildly interested in this whole concept, so I guess I'll share a little more about myself. I went to school for a degree in Culinary Arts - so I love to cook and bake and generally just get excited about food. I love music of all different types, however I mostly listen to hardcore, punk rock and hip hop. I'm super laid back, and usually really sarcastic. I'm a non-smoker and non-drinker. I enjoy having discussions with people on pretty much anything and love learning new things. I'm into computers and gaming in general (from SNES to Starcraft to COD), although not nearly as much as I'd like to be.  On the other hand, I'm also really into outdoor activities. I bought myself a cross bicycle and take it as many places as the weather permits me to. I'm a bit of a neat freak, so I make a pretty good guest if I may say so myself.

 I plan to start my trip in Philadelphia and end it in Pittsburgh, since I fall somewhere in between those two cities. I'd like to start somewhere in Feb or March. Here's a general idea of the direction I'll be heading and the cities I'm thinking of making stops in:

* Philadelphia, PA
* New York, NY
* Providence, RI
* Boston, MA
* Baltimore, MD
* Washington, DC
* Richmond, VA
* Raleigh, NC
* Charlotte, NC
* Charleston, SC
* Jacksonville, FL
* Orlando, FL
* Miami, FL
* Tampa, FL
* New Orleans, LA
* Houston/Austin/Dallas/San Antonio (I don't know anything about Texas, halp?), TX
* Phoenix, AZ
* Las Vegas, NV
* Los Angeles, CA
* San Francisco, CA
* Reno, NV
* Portland, OR
* Seattle, WA
* Minneapolis, MN
* Green Bay, WI
* Chicago, IL
* Columbus, OH
* Cleveland, OH
* Pittsburgh, PA 

Ideally, I'm looking for people who just want to hang out and have a good time. **(Even if you can't host and just want to hang, get a hold of me!)** If possible, I'm looking for people that are in, or very close to one of the cities I've listed, as I'll be traveling by bus and plane and won't be able to get very far unless there's public transportation to take me there. I don't care if you're male, female, a couple or a family. However, I'd prefer a home without small children (My tattoos and beard tend to scare them, and I'm just *really* awkward around them to be perfectly honest). I'm fine with pets, as long as they're not humping me while I sleep or something. An extra bedroom, couch, air mattress on the floor - whatever you can give me would be great. Access to a shower and/or washing machine and dryer would be a super bonus. Access to WiFi would be a huge plus, too! I'd be happy to help out wherever I can - I cook, I bake, I clean, etc etc. If you can take me places and show me around, that would be awesome. But, if you're just offering a place to stay and nothing more; that's fine, too! I would probably be looking to stay for 2-4 days in each city, just depending on your schedule, my travel opportunities and how much your area has to offer.


**TL;DR - Got laid off and want to travel, see new things and meet new, awesome people while I can. Looking for those who can host me for a few days for free or a few bucks for gas money, etc. Filling in the gaps with couchsurfing.org. It'll be a good time, and totally worth it in the end for both of us!**


I really just want to travel and experience new things and people. So if you think you can help me out, please let me know! You can comment or PM me, we can trade facebooks, numbers, whatever makes you feel comfortable and/or like I'm not going to steal your valuables or end up being absolutely bat shit crazy. 

So what do you say? [Help a fellow redditor out?](http://i.imgur.com/u6ftD.jpg) Maybe just upvote this post for exposure? I'd really appreciate it!

I had to study yesterday and specifically told him to come over around 6pm so I would have some time to myself. Either he didn't read the entire message or chose to ignore my instructions, because he showed up at 1pm. 

* 
I did tell him in my message that I had beer and leftovers for dinner that he's welcome to (as in, when I have dinner you can have some too) but he walks in, immediately asks for the beer and then tells me he's hungry and says leftovers sound good. 

* 
Then he takes out a wad of $3,000 in cash and starts counting it in front of me. I'm a student, and while my parents provide a very nice living situation for me, I don't really have the extra money lying around to be feeding someone who has an extra 3k in their pocket. I was always taught to wait for someone to offer you food and drink if you're a guest in their home, I just found it very rude that he would walk in and immediately ask to be pampered like that.

* 
We went to the grocery store and I hinted strongly that he should get some groceries for himself, which he either ignored or was too stupid to pick up on. 

* 
The entire time I was trying to hold a conversation, he was on his laptop.

* 
Later we went to a couchsurfing meetup at a bar, and he texted the whole fucking time, and disappeared for about an hour without a word. Apparently he went to a couple other bars. Oh, by the way, he had ordered an appetizer earlier in the night, and actually licked the bowl clean - I've never seen anyone behave so shamelessly like they were raised in a barn. 

* 
He was still awake when I went to sleep at about 4am, and when I woke up today he had left the light on all night long. I opened the fridge, and there sits a bottle of almond milk that he had taken from the pantry, opened, and helped himself to (he drank most of it). While I would have told him he could have it, he didn't even ask. If you're thirsty, drink water! 

These are just a few of the more egregious violations of basic etiquette. We did have some good conversations, and there were a few moments where I genuinely enjoyed his company, but I cannot in good conscience write a good reference. That being said, I'm too much of a pussy to write any of this on his profile. 

Should I just leave something vague like ""He's an interesting guy, that's for sure..."" or should I straight up give him a negative reference? I don't want him to fire back out of spite, as he seems like the type that would, even though I've been more than accommodating. Have any of you ever left or received a bad reference?

TL;DR: this guy was really fucking rude, should I say so on his profile?

I'm trying to read up on couchsurfing as much as I can but I have a few questions.

1) Should I sign up now on the site even though I won't be traveling soon? Why or why not?

2) Would a good way to get started be to contact locals in my city/state for lunch and couchsurfing to get initial references?

3) Is it possible to make a travel trip solely through couchsurfing? Or would I need to integrate hostels/hotels in my schedule? I'm guessing the answer would depend on the trip I'm trying to make.

4) Is there a how to get started guide on couchsurfing anywhere on reddit or the internet besides the actual website?

I have seen all the tips on couch surfing, but if you all would like to add anything feel free. 

That is basically it, if you would like to know why, continue reading.

I am 23 years old and like most 23 year olds, I still am unsure what direction I would like to take my life. I have been on the fast track to adult hood in America, Grade School, College, and now a career. However, I know if I stay where I am at I will regret it more and more each day that I dont make a change.

So I have decided to sell off all my possessions, minus a few key ones, and spend some time in Europe, out of my comfort zone, trying to  find some direction. I am hoping the diversity over there will make an impact on my life view. If none of that turns out, I know I will at least have an unforgettable experience and maybe meet some memorable people.

Anyway, if anyone is interesting in sharing some experiences with me, let me know.  I will warn you though, although I am an American, my guns only shoot water and I am not very fat.

I am a typical canadian woman, who fell in love with a country and decided to move in. I have been a couchsurfer for over 4 years but been backpacking for much longer. Since I love the idea of couchsurfing, I hosted a lot of peeps in my house and accepted almost every requests I've received. I am also an active member outside being a host, I love going to meetings and organizing activities with local couchsurfers. I started going to the only bi-weekly meeting in my country (No joke, there was only in the capital that a gang of CS would have regular meetings) and the meetings were fine in the beginning, but some things were bothering me a little. The first thing I thought was odd, was that the gang (local couchsurfers, with lots of references and CS experience) always wanted to have the meetings in fancy ass restaurants. I had always thought that being a couchsurfer meant being humble, but these people were a bit older than most CS (late 30's) and most of them were just rich guys that like to travel to fancy resorts and hotels. The first meetings were fine, but it started being expensive for me to go to those places, and they always refused the pubs I wanted to go or the cheaper restaurants. So, I stopped going for a few months, and went back for a meeting just to know if anything changed. Of course, nothing changed, it was even worst. They decided together that they would decline couchsurfers that are too ''hippie'', because they don't want to have to go to affordable places.

So after all the time I spent with them, I started being really frustrated. I was so frustrated because I loved going to meetings when I was still in my hometown in Canada, and it was a real pleasure to meet CS every week back then. We used to go to the cheapest bar in town and still have the time of our lives drinking the shittiest beers. I was quite nostalgic of these open-minded people, and I felt like I wouldn't be able to find any locals like them in my new country. My husband, who is also a couchsurfer, tried to help me build a new kind of CS meeting. We planned the idea for a long time before doing anything (the fancy couchsurfers were monopolizing the group of the city, so we were afraid that they might delete our posts) and we started slowly to go out to the same old pub with couchsurfers visiting our town. We would try to get as much people as possible, and then I would write a really vague message on the group, and we would send private messages to those who were interested. It was the beginning of something!

It went like that for 2 months, and now we are planning a new genre of meetings for september (lots of people, cheaper stuff, and more tacos). Right now, we are excited for our meeting next week, we are supposed to be 4 or 5 !! I feel like everything is going back to normal, after this awful year. We can finally say that it changed for the best, and I hope that we can get to know more CS because of that!!! :D

I found a post in AskReddit where another Redditor was going to leave to walk/hitch-hike across the states and was asking for partners. I figured I need to do it now or I'm not doing it. We started talking and it seemed like a sure fire thing.

I quit my crappy job, spent some money on some gear, and was ready to hit the road with him. Well, it fell through, which wasn't really a surprise to me anyways, as I had prepared for this.

Tomorrow, I leave with a sleeping bag and a backpack. My plans are pretty much summed up in this [VIDEO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49PkuTlUx4A). I'll be updating my [BLOG](http://www.thevagabondtale.blogspot.com) with video, text, and pictures as often as I get to a place with wifi.

As stated, I am looking to see if any Redditors around the country would be interested in letting me sleep on their floor for a night and hang out. I just need a small plot of floor to lay my bag down. Hell, I'll even sleep on a porch or in a backyard if you're cool with that. 

I'm asking this because I only have enough money left to buy any essentials I may need, and can't be wasting money on renting a hotel or a hostel, as that is a luxury. I'm not going to die due to freezing to death, as I have bought all necessary gear to survive average winter temperatures (in the lower states)

My goal is to meet as many people as possible, so even if you're not interested in letting me crash, we can hang out!

Advice is more than welcomed if you think that I am overlooking something. Yes, I know it is cold. Yes, I know it is dangerous. Yes, I am doing this anyways.

If anyone can think of another subreddit to cross post this in, let me know. I need to get the word out there so I can meet as many Redditors as possible!

One last note, if anyone wants to join in, we can meet up and hit the road together.

CS wouldn't let me respond since it was canceled, but now I'm stuck with a not 100% reply rate. I know this probably doesn't matter in the long run, but if it happened a bunch more, it could make some potential hosts view me negatively.

Long story short my family has made a huge move from Australia to London and is currently living in Oxford.

I've just finished college in Australia and will be 19 this year. Me and 4 other friends plan to travel through eastern Europe and then up through Greece and Croatia.

The sticky situation I am currently in is that the place my family is now staying in is 2 bedroom and isn't really suitable for 5 people. To ease the load I will be leaving on the 19th of May for my trip. My friends however will land in Europe around the 10th of April. I'm not looking for somewhere to stay all that time, but maybe for a few days I could find a friendly redditor to stay with!

If any couchsurfer out there, be it in England, France, Holland, Germany or anywhere in western Europe, has a square to sleep on the floor for as little as 3-4 days, please let me know!

My CS profile is: https://www.couchsurfing.org/people/thefrenchman/

I would like to think of myself as a friendly, outgoing person that enjoys anyones company and is willing to try anything!

Since this is my first time ever trying out CS I'm not sure how to approach hosts. Should I just send pms on the site to people whose profiles I like and go like ""Hola amigo/amiga. Qiero stay on your couch for a pequeño while."" ?

The title is a bit misleading as I'm not really looking for a couch yet but rather getting in touch with some Ccuchsurfers and specifically couchsurfers people from Chile.

My friend and I (23 yrs) are taking a road trip across the US from East to West, and we had planned on using couchsurfing to find good things to do and a place to stay (which seems to be pretty irritating to people otherwise it's just going to be camping or friends). From what I've read about what's happened with the corporate changes and all, CS is going downhill and new users are doing things that seem to go against what long time users think or do.

So what would you suggest we do to use cs correctly and have a good experience for my host and ourselves? A few things I've gathered:

* CS isn't free food and lodging, it's about cultural exchange
* Be respectful and understanding
* Help with the cooking. I thought about making a few things I know if they were interested in it
* Clean up after yourself, wash the dishes, leave as you found it, etc
* Bring a small gift for your host. I was thinking something local to my area
* Send personalized messages to your host describing yourself, your current travel plans, why you want to surf
* Have a backup plan
* Leave a reference once you move on

I have been a member for.... seven years I think, way back in cs 1.0.  I have been an ambassador on a few levels, participated in the site's dirty underbelly.  Except for the past year or so.  They don't want any user input anymore, which is really ok by me, if I can keep using the site to do what I do.

I moved to a major metropolitan area for the first time a few months ago (I've mostly lived in the mountains and medium sized cities).  I joined the Last minute couch group and follow it.  The only people who post in it are new members.  In four months I havent seen one post from someone with more than four friends.  I have hosted two people off the group (everyone has to start somewhere, right?  And I like to teach people about how the community works, how to get the most out of it.  Even though sometimes I feel the community is now mostly new members.) Both experiences sucked. One girl was a legitimate bum.  She stank, talked about how sweet her cars back home were, tried to invite other bums back to my house, disappeared and left her (unpacked) putrid pack at my house for two weeks, and showed zero gratitude that I kept all her things for her.  The other guy sucked too.  A big fat one. And these people I see posting every day it is exactly the same, over and over.  ""I don't have a good profile and just joined and I see that I should send personal requests but if you could just let me and my friend crash that would be great."" 

SO to the question before I rant too much, are there any hosts out there in big cities who are having good experiences with the last minute groups? I did before in when I lived in less populated areas, but I'm starting to think that in the metropolitan areas they are just a place for doomed experiences with lame surfers to manifest themselves.

Sidenote: If you are frustrated you can't get a couch to surf with a shit profile, HOST!! It's so simple! I joined six months before I knew I was going to start surfing and hosted everyone I could.  That is THE answer, it is the way to join the community.

I had the chance to meet tons of really cool people and had some great experiences.
 
Naturally, I was able to land a job with the company I work for now because it’s also semi-based on the couch surfing model. I don't know how many of you guys are familiar with AirBnB, but it's pretty much that, except we are focused on the European market pretty heavily. I work with [Wimdu](wimdu.com)
 
I'm not trying to self-promote at all but thought that I could help you guys out if you’re into couch surfing and want to use these types of services too. I have a pretty much endless supply of vouchers/discounts here, so if you're a traveler, PM me and I can hook you up. I'm a mod, so you can find my name on the side bar in the future.
 
Also, hosts that are into this style of couch surfing, I can help you guys out as well by giving you more exposure. Again, just message here or PM me and I'll see what I can do for you guys -- I'll hook up my fellow Redditors the same way I hook up friends and family (Probably more so since I hate my friends and family haha)
 
For those of you that don't know how we work, it's basically like this: You have an extra room, couch, van, tree house, and so on, you can rent it out to couch surfers or people traveling through the area and show them around town for a small profit. Hosts make maybe 40 bucks a night if they want, and travelers get to stay with some cool people and find out about decent places to go in the city without paying a bunch for hotels.
 
Personally, I'm a big couch surfing fan, especially if I’m going on a big road trip, but if I'm just visiting a couple of cities for a week or something, using a service like this can be much easier.
 
Anyways, feel free to PM me or post here with any questions or general chat.

I've been thinking about trying to organize a bit of a random trip around the country (USA). 

However, I think I might be a little lost if I just decided to visit some random places on my own. I'd like to utilize couchsurfing to connect with locals of wherever I decide to travel as I feel like this would make the experience a lot more memorable. However, I'm not sure how feasible this would be. I don't think I would be a very attractive person to host (considering I have no reviews or prior surfing or hosting experience myself) and I'm also kind of limiting the people who would potentially host me (I want people who would like to take an active part of my stay - I'm not looking for a tour guide but someone who is excited about wherever I decide to travel to and would like to give me ""their view"" of said location). I consider myself extremely friendly and easy to get along with, however I understand allowing strangers from the internet into your house may require a bit more than just me saying that.

Any thoughts on the feasibility of this idea? I'm not looking for a free ride, I can finance the travel, food, entertainment, etc. I just thought this would be vastly more fun than just going to random places on my own and staying in hotels.

The upside is that I'm not really set on specific places really, so maybe I could format my trip based on people who would offer to host me and have a passion for where they live.

I’ve had an account for about 18 months and am keen to join in, but there is (virtually) no couch surfing community where I live (group’s dead, no interest for events, travelers to this area are few and far between (about 3 in 2012, and 2 ended up going elsewhere instead)), so the only time I can really get involved is when I’m travelling and, as yet, I’ve never been able to find a host. Since I know Amsterdam will be a busy city, I’m wondering if I’d stand a better chance by contacting people sooner, although I also know a lot of people don’t like to be contacted more than a week or two in advance.

For info, I’m a 28 year old English female, travelling solo. I’m a freelancer, so normally like to get away for a couple of days when work’s not as busy, or over the weekend. Up until now, I’ve only been sending requests to other female surfers around the same age and/ or who seem similar in personality. My profile is complete, has photos and is regularly updated. I spend a lot of time on my couch requests, and always make sure they’re personalized, with several references to the host’s profile and why I think we’d get on, and clear information about myself and my trip. Since I only have one reference, from a friend, I always offer to skype/IM with potential hosts first if it would make them feel more comfortable. The rare feedback I get (although most people don’t reply at all), is positive, although they can’t host me for other reasons.

Money is not really an issue for me, but since where I live is pretty rural and I don’t have much of a social life while I’m here, I really value the company of others when I’m travelling.  I always have a back-up hostel booked and have met some great people staying in dorms, but I’d like to get to know some locals, too. Can anyone give me any tips on how to increase my chances?

Also, if anyone else is travelling to Amsterdam on these dates and would like to meet up, let me know! :)

Some info: I'm very easy to get along with, I'm a first timer and I've filled my profile out completely, I've been verified, male, 22, recent graduate from the U.S. I'm staying in Vienna from the 25th to the 30th.  I'd love to hang out with people but don't necessarily need someone to hold my hand and show me around the city. 

Thanks for reading!


**Update**: Ok, so a guy responded but he's going away on vacation.  He's offering to  leave his key for me as long as I walk his dog twice a day.  I guess this is the level I was looking for when I posted this. It's unfortunate that he won't be there to hang out.  I'll have to get a feel for what kinda things he likes from what he has in his house and leave him something nice for when he comes back.

Afterwards I will be taking the Trans-siberian/mogolian in December, Mongolia, SE asia and eventually Australia.

My methods;
I sleep outside, I left the US with 350 dollars, I since have more but not much. I use couchsurfing (plenty of vouches and ref's), I hitchhike or ride share depending on the time I have and the money in my Pocket.

edit; Maybe I can explain a little about myself, im not a train-hopping-gutter-punk... I am an entrepreneur, I have started 2 successful companies, to make my real money I have worked at a 4 star hotel as a bartender (orient express), along one of the best bartenders in the world. I got lucky with my life, I keep myself clean, I wear nice clothing. I had a normal life for a while and I hated it, worked 9-5 every day, had a hot girlfriend, a sweet apartment, new car, new motorcycle, the american dream I guess. My first big move was moving to Utah at 18 to try to become a professional snowboarder, that failed miserably so I moved back home to Philadelphia. When I was young I was raised in a dysfunctional household, father drank way too much in my eyes, so did I. I started working at 16, graduated high school at 18 because of summer courses. I wanted to goto college but couldn't because I completely fucked myself in High school and I couldn't get my parents to co-sign a loan for school. Completed 2 years in a Community college for Accounting and Business. I have tattoo's but you cant see them, one is a mustache on my lip (underneath).

I'm a long-time host and surfer from Chicago, heading to Colombia with my band for a music festival next week. I'll be sticking around Bogota until early April, and then I might make my way to Lima (either through Ecuador, or by plane). I fly back to Chicago (from Bogota) on May 7th.

So basically I'm planning on heading out pretty soon and getting a job out there so I can have a bit extra money to travel longer. 

Australia is pretty damn cool, I've always wanted to go and just the other day at work when I was gutting some squids I pulled out that weird squishy stomach bit out of it and with it came a whole fish with this really sad and startled expression on it's face.

It made me realise life is short so that's why I want to go now. Now as in a few weeks.

Got my working holiday visa sorted, going to book a flight pretty soon and think of a really creative way to quit my job (meat and fish counters at your local supermarket).

I have some money but not much. I know a lot of people would advise waiting and saving and saving and then thinking about going but I'm tellin' ya man, that fish really got to me.

Also I asked my Magic-8 Ball and when I asked it if I should go it said ""GO FOR IT"" and you can't really ignore the advice of a mass manufactured plastic toy - it makes all my important life decisions for me.

And I believe my arty/photography side would benefit from seeing some more of the world.

So Australia it is - goodbye cold UK winter with your icy chill and frosty breath.

If anyone could help me out with somewhere to stay for however long, recommendations of things to do/see or anything else I can do really cheap/free (I'm going to become a hippie-tramp - who needs money) or anyone interested in meeting up or doing the same thing, get in contact!

So far the trip had been awesome. You Americans have a beautiful country, and the few people we have gotten in touch with have been really friendly.

We just feel we are missing a bit out because we are mostly just driving, and with the exception of the larger cities and the typical touristy things to do, we really have no idea where to stop to connect to people, or find those ""hidden gems"" on the way.

Couchsurfing was definitely part of my life for the past 6 years. Over the last year I was making some transitions from St. Louis to New York that I have to give up CS for a bit. Today I decided to reopen my long-forgotten profile. A doubt starts to develop: why have I never been vouched for by the 52 people who left comments on my profile?

There's a a bit of history: a few years ago a CS friend of mine (who used to be the ambassador of a major city in the world) told me that Couchsurfing's funding was questionable and most of the donation went straight to Casey Fenton's personal account, and that if i wanted some verification vouch is the best way. Things have changed a great deal in Couchsurfing's management and the type of folks CS attracts nowadays. There's goods and bads. However i am still yet to find out the process of being vouched for: Do people only vouch for their IRL friends or do people have to ask for it or is it that pretty girls get vouched for their attractiveness? I am confused and a bit bitter, but still a good CS host/ traveler :)

I just created my account today. I have roughly $600 dollars and 3 months and I have no ultimate destination in mind although there are specific places I would like to experience in the United States, like Austin, Texas.

I have a motorcycle and I plan on packing lightly. I have friends in the Bay Area, the L.A. area, and family in Houston, but otherwise I want to somehow maybe zig zag my way down to Texas. However, I'm not too set on any particular route and I've never seen the East Coast either, although I hear it's hot right now.

I also wouldn't mind finding people who need rides here or there and maybe I could craigslist rideshare for a tank of gas, which would help me conserve funds immensely. 

I just graduated from college and I can work odd jobs here and there for cash. Also, I'm a generally affable person and other people I've met in the non virtual world have told me I should be just fine. I trust the bike is in good shape and I would hope to encounter good people who know honest mechanics along the way to properly maintain the motorcycle. 

My first question is, from here where do I go? Am I being too idealistic?

I plan on leaving in about two weeks and maybe heading to Montana, the only Western state I've never been. I'm not afraid of heat, it's the rain I'm not too excited about encountering. I plan on bringing a full cover sleeping bag and a fresh pair of emergency clothes for surfing, so I don't scare anyone off with body odors. But do people normally allow you to use their shower and laundry machines? If so I wouldn't need more than a few days worth of clothing because there are thrift stores in nearly every state, I imagine, if I absolutely needed to get something else. 

My second general question is: What will I eat? I'm used to eating a lot of raw (and cooked) vegetables and healthy foods and snacks. I'm a gardener but I'm not a scavenger or a forager and I don't know what wild foods are edible, nor do I trust myself with a book on wild foods. I imagine there are not health food stores in every state, so what would I be preparing for? Ideally I will spend as little on chain food restaurants as possible. I can also cook and do cook meat and am not against eating it but don't buy it often because it is generally more expensive and if it's not than it's probably questionable anyway.

My third and final question is: How often can a work for couch/food situation be negotiated on CS? I've never woofed, but my friends who have have told me that there are places that will let you crash for a week and will feed you in exchange for work. I plan on checking some of those out, but how often does it happen here?

* Is it acceptable to couchsurf locally to get good references? I have a place to stay, but I want to build up my profile so it looks solid by the time I really need it. Is it cheating to couchsurf in your own city when you don't actually need to?

  -Quite normal, at least FB doesn't have one... Good luck for the troubleshooting!

  -always the same! you guys need to stop changing the appearance every single week u.u i get lost!
 
  -thanks for that information ... I really wondered about it
 
  -Website is often slow and crashes.

  -I continually have problems with ur site...

  -Well you are having problems quite often on your server, probably one server ain't enough. The info about my replying to CS request suddenly changed from 100% to 96% but I am 120% sure I always do reply every CS request, what can I do? Honestly it sucks to have 96% there when I am very responsible in this.
 
  -I confirmed a few friend requests but when I see a list, there's 0?? can you pls. fix this? Thanks!
 
  -Maybe don't touch what works! Destroying little by little.  

  -Website is quite often slow.maybe better server??

I don't need people to be exactly like me or my friends but I need to know that I can have a conversation on something I am interested in.

My housemate likes people totally different from us because he finds it more interesting to talk to people with totally different lifestyles to our own.  He avoids people who are into the same kind of things as us and likes to host people he wouldn't naturally get to talk to otherwise.

My roommate (a Redditor as well - /u/iWag) and I are going to Firefly Music Festival on June 21-23 in Delaware, and live in Cincinnati, OH. We have the week prior off of work to do a roadtrip leading up to the festival, and are debating between exploring the southeast (limit to South Carolina distance-wise) and the northeast (limit to Boston distance-wise). We think it would be pretty cool to try and bunk with some hosts along the way to help mitigate expenses and meet some cool new people!

My questions:

1. First off, any advice on which way to go? We know we want to spend a few days in DC right before the trip, just to check out all of the monuments and museums and whatnot, but are pretty open to the rest. We'll want to camp some along the way as well.

2. How much leadtime do hosts usually need/prefer to accept two guys?

My goal is to travel to the UK mostly to improve my English speaking skills. What do you think, is it possible to stay at somebody's place for a week? I mean, 1 day is ok for everybody, but I generally dont feel like moving while I am in the UK and constantly searching a new couch for the next day.

Hope you're all having a lovely day.
I'm backpacking around Europe for three months this fall and right now I'm in London. So far I've been staying in hostels and even though it's only been about a week I can tell that if I continue on this way my trip is going to be a succession of one tourist trap after another. This is definitely not what I'm looking for! Everyone I've met that has couchsurfed loved it so I think it would be good to give it a try.

So I have two questions. 
*First and most importantly:* if you live somewhere in England in a more rural area or really anywhere that isn't a huge city, want to host me? :)
*Second:* do you have any advice for choosing towns to stay in, places to visit, etc.?

This is all kind of last minute. I was going to stay in one place and work at a hostel but ended up deciding against it because I wanted to see more different places. Now I need to figure out the best way to actually do that.
I would love to travel around to random little towns wherever I can find hosts. Right now I want to continue exploring England but then I hope to go up to Scotland, over to Ireland, back to the mainland for France, and then work my way east along the north and back around to Spain via southern countries. I know that's pretty ambitious but it's just my vague directions for now. So if you're anywhere along there feel free to hit me up!

I've got a bit of a backstory about this host who I stayed with in Pisa four months ago. I haven't written him a reference at all, but to this day I still occasionally think about what happened and can't make sense of it.

He was a fine host at first, until out of no where he told me he wanted 50EUR for the time I spent in his place. He rationalized it as paying for the food that I'd eaten. Now, I did owe him 15EUR for a pizza we went half and half on, but the ONLY thing I took from his kitchen was some coffee (which he had a metric fuckton of). How cheap do you have to be to charge your guests for *coffee?*

Then, I went out on a little day trip to the beach. One hour after I get there, he sends me a text saying I have to come back and find a new place to stay THAT NIGHT, because he had an emergency. I understand emergencies, but this left me in a very awkward situation, with most hostels booked and no other place to go. He said he'd be out of Pisa for three days. I ran into him the NEXT day at a cafe.

As far as I know, we got along, and I didn't ask if he really just wanted to kick me out. At some point he said that sometimes young people treat couchsurfing like a hostel, which insulted me a lot. He said it was because we didn't spend a lot of time together, but what am I supposed to do if he wants to stay in the house and I want to explore? Sit around waiting?

I think a lot of it might've been cultural and linguistic misunderstandings, but I'm not so sure. I've wanted to leave a reference, but I wasn't sure whether to leave a neutral or negative one. Now that it's been four months, I think it's too late.

Does anyone have a couch available? It doesn't have to be the full 3 nights .. 1-2 nights would be great too.

I'm very easy going and independent! I am not looking for a full time tour guide as I can find my way around by myself if you're busy during the day. Meeting up for dinner and/or pints would be great!

Also, if any Edinburgh folk want to just meet up for a pint .. I am cool with that as well!

This requires a 1 mile hike downriver from the highway 49 bridge and will be during mid-week, so we should have the spot mostly to ourselves.

Expect hot, sunny days, cool nights, and a crystal clear and warm welcoming river. Responsible campfires and swimming are encouraged. Hitchhiking to and from Nevada City during the day is easy enough to haul in water and food. I will have a water filter, so I can refill water for you if necessary.

Directions: From Nevada City, California hitch north 7 miles until you come to the bridge over the South Fork of the Yuba River. Climb down the rocks and hike (hike along the river, NOT along Independence Trail) about two thirds of a mile downstream until you come across the spot where telephone lines cross over the river high above you. Keep travelling down river an additional 900 feet until you come to a creek (Rush Creek) that flows into the river on your left. This is the destination known as Jones Bar Crossing, a historic place along the South Fork of the Yuba River.

I'm a 21 year old male that has been in beautiful Vancouver for just over a month now! I have a part time job as an outdoor education instructor for kids and am loving it! I've only been involved with couchsurfing for around 3 months but have had awesome experiences so far with it!

At this stage, I'm living in a place that I cannot afford due to lack of hours at work and quickly running out of funds so will be forced to leave very soon. 

I'm hoping to find a host that will let me stay slightly longer term than usual - I'm hoping for anywhere between two weeks to a couple of months. I'm super handy around the house and would love to help out with cleaning and anything else in exchange for a couch or spot on the floor! If you have a room or bed spare I would love to contribute whatever I can afford weekly to pay for my stay, it's just I can't commit to a full rental because I do not earn enough at this stage (am looking for more employment). 

I am very clean, easy going and super helpful!
A small list of things I could help with :

- Cleaning
- Other housework
- Gardenening and landscaping
- Painting
- Basic computers
- Personal training / take you for a workout
- Nutritional advice
- Help with english
- Help with exercise science / kinesiology study
- Teach you how to slackline / rock climb / basics of hiking, camping and hammock camping

Hi all,

I'm looking for trip suggestions **during the months of April-May, around 4-5 weeks.**

I originally wanted to do SE Asia, but apparently rainy season is ramping up now and will be in full force in May, so I think that's out.

AUS/NZ is getting colder, so I think that's out.

What other good options could I have?

I was looking at Peru/Machu Picchu which is in season, but I don't know how to make a one month trip out of it since I'm not all that interested in southern peru / lake titicaca / etc.

I was trying to find an easy way to combine Colombia (Cartagena and Santa Marta), but the logistics of getting between Colombia and Peru seems tricky.

Any other suggestions?

I've already done:

- eastern europe (krakow, budapest, prague, berlin)
- spain (barcelona, valencia, alicante)
- brazil (rio + iguazu falls)",,False,self,t5_2qs85,False,,,True,t3_1bz356,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/1bz356/suggestions_for_a_1month_trip_during_aprilmay/,

Scotland from the 9th of March,
Ireland for St Paddy,
Northern England,

Germany,
Prague,
Austria,
Italy,
(maybe swing into Switerland and France to see a different areas from the Capitals depending on time and money)
and finally Spain

I don't want to be a leech. Depending on what the host needs, I could stay at a couch for a day or two, meet some people, and move onto the next couch. By the time I finally get a job that can support me, I'll have a close circle of friends in the city that I can hang out with.

My question is, is this kosher? I know some people out there don't like the idea of using their couch to crash, but I like the idea of moving around and meeting a whole bunch of people in a foreign land. :)",,False,self,t5_2qs85,True,,,True,t3_j69kt,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/j69kt/ethics_of_setting_up_base_in_another_country/,

I have been lurking around CS for a while, but I finally want to make the step of actually couchsurf. I'm gonna be in Austin, TX for SXSW and to return back to Boston, I was really hoping to road trip it.

I was wondering what do you guys think of it, and whether you think it is feasible? I'm a solo traveller. I wanted to find rides on Craigslist or other ridesharing platform, but I imagine finding it straight to Boston is impossible.

- Is it possible to Couchsurf, when I really don't know when I'm going to be where?
- How long do you guys think it's gonna take?

In case things don't work out perfectly, I imagine staying at hotels/airbnbs and taking buses/flights is a good option?",,False,self,t5_2qs85,False,,,True,t3_184juy,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/184juy/roadtrip_from_austin_to_boston/,

I know this subreddit is more for travelers who are looking for a place to stay but I still figured it might be a good place to start.

I've stayed at 3 different places in the last 3 nights. The friend I stayed with last night is my old roommate/good friend's girlfriend, and my old roommate was there also. I would really like to stay there for a couple more nights and they don't seem to mind, but I don't want to impose on them. How do I make sure of that? I know if I ask to stay another night they won't turn me away but I don't want to stay if they don't want me to.

Alternatively, I wouldn't mind couch surfing at peoples' houses on couchsurfing.org. However, I'm not sure how people on the site feel about locals couch surfing, since it seems to me as though the site is geared more towards travelers just passing through. Anyone have experience with this? I'm a college student and I also work, so I really need to stay somewhere locally.

Any help would be appreciated.


**EDIT:** Maybe a little background info would help. My friend (friend's girlfriend, I'll call her M) I stayed with last night actually used to stay at my apartment all the time when I lived with her boyfriend (I'll call him K). Not for any reason other than just spending time with K. I am a very easy-going person and made M feel at home. Never asked or expected her to be super clean or anything. I hang out with K pretty regularly and we are really good friends.

So far, I feel the most welcome at M's place; they even gave me the code to enter the garage. However, K will only be staying at her place tonight, and will be going back to his parents' house Thursday night because he lives there. He just stays at her place because we all go to school down here. They said I can stay again tonight, but would it be weird if I asked to stay at M's place Thursday night too? I would never even think of pulling something with M, and I'm sure they both trust that I wouldn't either. As I said before, I consider them both good friends. I just don't want to take advantage of the fact that they're really nice people and wouldn't turn me down if I asked to stay.",,False,self,t5_2qs85,1354121367.0,,,True,t3_13xthg,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/13xthg/couch_surfing_at_different_friends_places_how_do/,

I recently graduated after five long years in college and grad school, and am now on my way to experience Europe for the first time ever. I am male, 24 years old, looking to experience the many different foods, music, lives, and cultures of Europe. But most importantly, I am looking to sample beers from different regions. 
  
  
I am very laid back and flexible with schedules and plans. I am easy to get along with and I love making friends and meeting people. I am willing to step outside of my comfort zone, which is pretty vast to begin with, and try out new things. If you are a host who wants to be a part of my European experience, please feel free to contact me. You may want to recommend places to visit and see, or even partake in the adventures and go out with me, but don't feel obligated to.
  
  
I will be carrying a sleeping bag, so your floor would be just as awesome as a couch. Other little things about myself: my hobbies include swing dancing and latin dances, learning different languages (currently learning Spanish and German), science, video games, people watching, cooking, and eating.
  
I have a pretty flexible schedule but these are the points of interest, in order of tentative dates (some dates may overlap, since these dates are flexible):

It would be a 1 night stay for every city but Vancouver; we're looking for lodging for 2 nights there.  I can add more details later, but I thought I would test the waters in this subreddit first and see if there's anyone interested.

He contacted us and was very insistent about coming over. We had all made loose plans to hang out some day, as he is from her home state Michigan and it would involve a lot of traveling. I would have been OK with meeting this guy ahead of time before hosting him at my house, but he was already on the train to our town before I knew I was hosting him. And had a story about being kicked out of his home in Michigan, so he came to Georgia (which seems kind of dumb? IDK)

Fair enough, I tried to be a good hostess. I cooked meals, made accommodations, gave him clothes, washed his clothes and gave him medicine. I wanted him out of the house by Monday, since I wasn't prepared at all to have house-guests, and honestly it was making me anxious. I don't like being anxious in my own house, I don't get any rest or work done this way.

My girlfriend didn't tell him to leave that day, she kept telling him ""a few more days"" and so when I said Wednesday, it was only Tuesday that she told him he had to be out. 

He left on Wednesday before I got home, left some of his things and whatnot...Girlfriend is sad and now I look like a bitch to her friend, who I really wanted to get along with. I feel really bad and there was a storm after we kicked him out, which made her feel even worse...and in turn, made me feel like a horrible person. I also feel bad that I didn't tell him to his face that I was uncomfortable, but I don't know him well and he's not my friend yet. Was it unfair of me to expect my girlfriend would handle her own guest? 

BTW we share our small rental house with two other males. None of us knew this guy was showing up until two days before time, and at that point he had not disclosed to us that he was homeless. 

I guess the question is, should my girlfriend or I feel bad about not accommodating a friend? Even if he made a poor decision of cross-country traveling while homeless, without saying so till he was here? 

And today he's back at the house. I don't want to kick him out again, I want him to get on his feet and find something but at the same time I never expected to be a stepping stone for this guy. what do I do?",,False,self,t5_2qs85,False,,,True,t3_1ik7nt,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/1ik7nt/surprise_couchsurfer_what_do_i_do/,

As the title says I am new to couchsurfing and traveling on my own.

For the last one and a half years I've been working hard to earn enough money for my lifelong dream of traveling across the United States on my own.

After some research on how to get there and how to get around, I quickly found that Couchsurfing was a very viable option, and I was very intrigued.

I am however, a bit overwhelmed and to be honest, nervous about all these new things so I thought of a few ""questions"" that would make things easier for me.

- I created my profile on couchsurfing.org, but am now faced with the impossible choice of where I go first and who to request a stay with.
At first I thought of New York being the most sensible place to stay, with its multi-cultural and open minded attitude. 

- Do you have any tips on finding my first adress? As stated, I made my profile but have no feedback or previous experiences. I will probably get the verified option to make things easier for possible hosts, but I'm still hesitant as to my chances here.

Reading this post now I realize how much of a mess my head is in, for which I apologize. I'm really excited to go, but also nervous of what is to come. Any help you are able to offer would be greatly appreciated!

**Some personal info:**

- I am male, 21 years old, from The Netherlands.

- I will travel alone, and stay for no more than 2-3 days at each address (at least that's what I'm thinking now)

- My budget is roughly 6000 €

- I am very easygoing and laid back.

I'm really making this post because I read so many nice replies here, and lack those in my real life enviroment. I need some advice on getting started.

Thanks for reading this massive wall of text and if you have any advice/help whatsoever, it would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance,

Because of this I didn't make any reservations at a hostel and now it's impossible to get one.

29 Nov – 28 Jan

I was born and raised in NY, and have been living in San Francisco for 10 years. Looking for the next steps in my life, I have decided to explore Australia on my bike for 2 months. My goal would be to travel from Sydney to Melbourne, spending about a month in both.

Looking for tips on eating/living cheaply, meeting people and places to see. I like hipster stuff, craft beer, live music, dive bars, food and bike rides. My budget will determine how crazy I can get as far as adventures.

Currently I'm trying to work out a deal with someone on airbnb.com for stay until the 22nd. The apartment is located in Surry Hills, for approx 400/week. Pricey, but seems really convient. I would also like to explore some cheaper options. Gumtree and cs.org so far have been shady or unstable. Not sure how I feel about hostels. Would be okay with spending $ for a more secure spot. Suggestions?

Thanks a lot in advance, and I am looking forward to having a blast. Shaun",,False,self,t5_2qs85,False,,,True,t3_128kd8,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/128kd8/sydney_and_melbourne_first_timer_looking_for/,

what do all of you think about couchsurfing in one city for two months? possibly going from couch to couch. I think it's possible that this would be frowned upon in the couchsurfing community, and would be seen as free loading. but the hospitality of the turks might not make it so.

My name is Ben; I'm an American Redditor currently living in San Sebastian, Spain, working on ~~avoiding a full time job~~ a post-graduation internship. I'll be starting my trip around the world in June and was hoping I'd be able to couchsurf and/or meetup with fellow redditors during this time. I'll be in the following cities during the following dates (I've noted where I already have a couch):

* June 10-13: Edinburgh, Scotland (have a couch)
* June 13-16: Amsterdam, Netherlands (have THREE couches! [go redditors!])
* June 16-20: Dusseldorf, Germany (have a couch)
* June 20-23: Berlin, Germany (have a couch)
* June 23-26: Prague, Czech Republic
* June 26-28: Vienna, Austria (have a couch)
* June 28-30: Budapest, Hungary (have a hostel)
* June 30-July 3: Geneva, Switzerland
* July 3-5: Venice, Italy
* July 5-8: Rome, Italy
* July 8-11: Athens, Greece
* July 11-14: Paris, France (have a couch)

I'm putting some effort into planning a sweet trip. This is what I've got so far...

fly from Miami -&gt; Vancouver (surf for 2 nights)
take train from Vancouver -&gt; Seattle (surf for 2 nights)
take train from Seattle -&gt; Portlant (surf for 2 nights)
take train from Portland -&gt; San Francisco (surf for 2 nights)
take train from San Francisco -&gt; Los Angeles (surf for 2 nights)
take train from Los Angeles -&gt; San Diego (surf for 2 nights)
fly from San Diego -&gt; Miami

I'm from the East Coast and have been to the West Coast a couple times and, overall, it just seems more appealing to me. Do any of you guys have any recommendations for a better path? I'm looking for hosts that are 420 friendly and can show me some nice nature spots.

Ok, now for the questions:

1. How many people will actually be willing to host an 18 year old male? I'm polite, calm, and cleanly, but I'm sure every guest says that as well...

2. Is it hard to find a host when you have little to no feedback? Maybe I should consider surfing locally for a couple nights to gain some feedback?

3. Are most hosts just offering a place to sleep or are some willing to show you around the city and have a good time?

That in mind, I'll only have maybe $400 to travel. I have a sister there who I'd like to visit for a few days and then make my way back.
My dates are flexible and my only goal is to make it there and see a lot of sights on the way. I recently signed up at the CS.org site and posted an activity stating my intention. I know I have to fill out my profile more and will mess around with the site more but I was looking for advice.

I am fine with camping out but this is pretty new to me. Most my experience comes from desert trips where I sleep in a truck, trailer, or tent for a few days. I am doing this because I am getting kicked out of my house on New Years and I really want to explore and see what is outside of my state. I do have 2 small kids I am leaving behind for this trip and want to make it back safely within ~10 days.
I wouldn't mind making a new friend who would travel with me some or all of the way as long as they can contribute and are relate to myself.

How can I get across the country in the cheapest way possible? Where are places I could stop to get food if I don't want to eat just rice or ramen? Is hauling around a backpack with my sleeping bag, clothes, and simple supplies feasible? 
I am in great shape but don't do much cardio, I only plan to walk/hike where needed and was thinking buses, trains, and maybe arranging a ride the other times. I'm no Forrest Gump.

* How far in advance should I contact people? When I travel I have rough ideas for an itinerary and may spend longer (or shorter) amounts of time in a particular area. I'd hate to inconvenience someone by saying I will be in their city on Monday .. but then decide I won't get there until Wednesday. How would I balance being considerate to being more free with my plans.

* As a surfer do you give your hosts any sort of gifts? I will be backpacking so I don't want to pack around a lot of stuff.

* When planning for a stay in a particular area do you contact several people? To me it might seem rude to decide on one place and then tell the others .. sorry I found somewhere else.

so I started using couch surfing recently, just browsing actually. I found out that she was looking for a host in my city, I texted her and after 2 days she was standing next to me. I tried everything to make her stay at my place/city enjoyable as much as possible - I took a day off at work, we got some drinks, I showed her the whole city, taught her how to drive my car (yes, she doesn't have the drivers licence), give her a ride on my motorbike, we had some drinks and the night before she left we drank some wine, eat food and watch a movie together. I've read some part of a book for her when she was falling asleep and in the morning I prepared really good breakfast. Finally I gave her a great book with my dedication written there and then she took her stuff and left. Right before that she told me I was the best host for her so far and she couldn't imagine having better time in my city. I stayed classy for the very end, I didn't make any special move and tried to do everything to leave this feeling of safety in her. 
 

And now I have her number and of course I'm invited to visit her city and stay at her place. But I want to play it differently - so Reddit, please please give me any advice what should I do...
Since she didn't have any camera here I decided to take some photos afterwards and now I plan to send it to her home with some note attached, but I don't know what to write and how to 'ask her out' when there's 5hrs drive distance between us. What should I do now? She has a lot of positive comments on CS so I'm pretty sure she treated this stay at my place as a normal couch-surfing, so yeah... How to move it forward?

I'm currently signing up on the couchsurfing website and I'll make a post there but I figured I'd put something here too.  To describe my situation I'll just quote the post I put on /r/Albuquerque 

&gt;Hey r/albuquerque, I'm an Ohioan who just recently graduated from The Ohio State University with a degree in Film and Video Production and another in Marketing and an opportunity has presented itself in your fine city.
&gt;
&gt;A very successful Ohio based film company is shooting their new production in ABQ and I have been offered an unpaid position with them in their production offices. This is an opportunity for me to gain professional experience in the industry I want to work in as well as network with like minded individuals. I'm really excited about this and want to pursue it, but as well as being unpaid they also are not covering costs, so I need a place to stay. The shoot just finished up its second week and will be going until June 19th or 20th. They want me out there as soon as possible. My plan right now would be to leave Columbus on Monday and get to Albuquerque on Wednesday.
&gt;
&gt;So, obviously this is incredibly short notice and I'm asking a lot, but if anyone had a spare room or someone needed a sub-lease for a month I would be incredibly grateful. I would compensate you however you would like, I'm just trying not to spend $100 a night at a hotel as I definitely do not have that kind of money and I'm also not trying to sleep in my car for a month.
&gt;
&gt;As far as who I am, I'm a 22 year old male, I'm clean and I tend to keep to myself until I get to know people, then I can be pretty out-going. But from my discussions with the producer it sounds like I will be working a lot of hours in the offices so you would probably barely know I'm there. I'm essentially just looking for a bed or a couch or a floor where I could place some pillows and a blanket for a few days and maybe a shower that I could use a few times.
&gt;
&gt;Please message me if you have any way to help or know anyone who could, and much thanks and Karma to anyone who replies.
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again!

So that's that, and any info you could give me to assist a new couchsurfer would be awesome.

Will compensate by cooking, cleaning, playing guitar for you.

Guys and girls--I'm trying to get to GDC, so I can cover the conference for a small gaming website, as well as spread resumes all over the place. I had a place to stay lined up, but it seems like my host is getting cold feet.  

This conference is kind of a big deal for me. I might not have another chance to network like this again, and I desperately need this chance to try and get a job.

Ideally I'd need a parking spot, a couch to sleep on, a stove, and place to set up my computer so that I can write up the conference in something resembling real time.  At minimum, I could settle with just having access to a shower and an iron, so I can look professional.  I'll bring my own soap and what not.  

I **just** moved to Sacramento from Detroit, and while it isn't terribly far from here to San Fran, I'm really poor--almost homeless--and I **really** can't afford to drive back and forth to San Fran 5 days in a row.  I don't have much money to offer as payment, but I'm an okay guitar player, and I'd be willing to sing for my metaphorical supper.  I'd even cook and clean your house a bit, if you want.

I'll bring my own food (canned soup, bread, and Tuna fish FTW) so I won't get into your private stocks.  I could even pay in...[other ways](http://i.imgur.com/wzzlUrm.jpg), (SFW?). even though I won't be partaking, since I'm trying to find a job and need to pass a drug test. 

So, some evidence to  collaborate my story:

[Here's a picture of me with a broken nose I got saturday at rugby!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/1anbu7/so_how_was_your_weekend_ruggit_because_i_broke_my/)

This past year at CouchSurfing has been a unique one in our history. We've changed our legal structure. We shrank our team significantly (previously at 44 including part-time), and then grew it to around 35 people (roughly half in engineering). We opened our first real office, ever. We grew up a lot as an organization, adopting more internal structure and accountability than we've ever had. And we're going to continue hiring experienced people at all levels of the organization, from the top to the bottom. But throughout all the changes, it has always been important to me to preserve the original CouchSurfing spirit, values, vision, and mission. After all, that's why we all got involved in the first place.

As President of CouchSurfing International, the organization that supports the CS community, there are a number of areas I'd like to focus on improving. First, we need to make it easier for surfers and hosts to connect with one another. The ability to post travel plans, which gives hosts more ability to select when and who to host, was one of our first steps to address this issue. We've also just begun taking member suggestions on other ways to work on this problem.

Second, I think it is crucial that new members understand what CouchSurfing is really about. If we attract the wrong kinds of people, or the right kinds of people who have the wrong expectations, then we will lose some of our magic. So it's important to grow with the right people and in the right ways.

And finally, we have plans to improve the reference system, release a mobile app, improve the speed and reliability of the website, enhance our user interface and usability, and more. There is no shortage of things to do, and it takes time to build everything we want to build, even with our newly expanded team. But we're working hard and making progress every day!

I know that there has been a lot of change lately, and many of you are watching carefully to see where we're going. It's important to me that you know that our ideals as an organization have not changed. CouchSurfing has always been about something greater than just travel. It's about human connection. It's about experiences. It's about finding friends, experiencing community, and expanding your horizons wherever you go. It's about making the world a better place. I think we're closer than we've ever been to that goal.

Happy surfing and big hugs from California,

Dan Hoffer""

We are a male and female both 22 with a small cat, extremely clean looking for a temporary place to stay (about a week, but will take any time available, we don't want to impose) in San Diego while we get on our feet. 

We have many job and living prospects, however we are still waiting on some additional paperwork and funds go come through. We are a very friendly couple of people, but will keep to ourselves and help with the cooking, cleaning, etc.  

We are currently considering hostiles, but due to lack of financial stability we are staying in our car so we would love to have a space as soon as possible.

Spreading the lies of an angry ""mob"".
This is the cacophony of losers
Who'll never again be CS Gods...
 
 
If I wouldn't loathe the ignorant sheep-like mob so much I would probably mind the ongoing phony manipulation of them.

And yet I would most probably still secretly (well - not so secretly any more now...) admire the cleverness behind the simple but very effective idea to break some CS rule that will definitely get your profile deleted WHILE AT THE SAME TIME being very prominently ""outspoken"" against CS.
(Well... ""outspoken"" :-D That's of course nonsense and nothing but their twist on what really is nothing more than repeating and summarizing all the retarded nonsense by the usual bunch of idiots who obviously drew all their pathetic self-esteem from acting like the benevolent enlighteners of the people only trying to open these common simpletons' eyes for all that's rotten in the state of CS - and then mixing that up with some actually valid points...)

What's so clever about this is, that the breaking of the rules which would definitely get their profiles deleted had that exact desired effect and now they can claim they got deleted for being outspoken and thus make themselves martyrs receiving all the attention they were up for;-)
And then people still think ME to be an attention whore:-D

What I like best about that is that the guys in the CS organization fell for that tactic:-D
Beginning with those amateurs who take care of actual members' safety on CS (and that actually not THAT badly) PLUS all which falls under their ridiculously idiotic broader interpretation of the term ""members' safety"" (and that as pathetically as it inevitably has to be when this is really nothing but a highly arrogant patronizing of all other CS'ers under the phony pretense of caring about their safety) and from there all the way up to the CS boss who now pays the bill for giving the amateurs free reign. Makes the comparison of the CS safety guys with J. Edgar Hover even more accurate when one considers how later US presidents hated how they couldn't get rid of the ghosts the former leadership hat put into their positions;-)",,False,self,t5_2qs85,1362774380.0,,,True,t3_19xhfs,http://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/19xhfs/do_you_hear_the_surfers_whine_the_clever_tactic/,

I can provide plenty of evidence to prove we are trustworthy upstanding people from my facebook page to my linkedin profile, etc... We would love to also hang out with whomever is willing to house us and you can show us your favorite local pub and/or restaurant but if you are busy we are also content to explore on our own.

I have been to London 2 times previously so I wouldn't need much help other than a place to sleep but I am interested in meeting locals to see what the ""real london"" is all about so even if you can't help us out with a couch please let me know if you live in London and are willing to meetup for a pint or a coffee and some conversing.

Thanks for taking the time to read!

How should I destroy my couch? 

1. Blow it up with gunpowder
2. Burn it with lots of gas
3. Drop it off a building. ""i have a 5 story building I think I can drop it off of"" ,but I dont know how I would get it to the top...maby with a rope...
4. I can shoot it with guns
5. I can try to blow it up with tannerite
6. My father in-law owns a junkyard. We can try to destroy it with old car airbags.
7. I can take it to an Amish saw mill and have them use there big sawmill saws to cut it up. 
8. I could just beat the shit out of it with a machete, sledge hammer &amp; chainsaw. 
9. I'm open to suggestions.
