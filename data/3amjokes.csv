",Jugemu,29,9,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/3amjokes/comments/19ig03/a_boy_and_a_girl_fall_in_love/,"…and decide to get married. After a few years, they decide that they want a child. The wife gets pregnant, and the couple is overjoyed as they plan for their little bundle of joy. 

Well, the day of the baby’s delivery comes, and everything seems to be going great… at first. Partway through the delivery, unfortunately, the doctor delivers some bad news: their otherwise perfectly healthy baby boy was born with just a head. No arms, no legs, no torso, just a head. 

The father is devastated. All of his dreams of taking his son hiking, teaching him sports, and giving him a normal, happy life have been shattered. But he decides to still love the boy and do everything he can to give him a good life. 

The boy begins to grow up, and in spite of the difficulties of having no torso or appendages, he lives a relatively normal life.  He makes it through school and graduates. He even gets into a decent university. Then he hits his 21st birthday. 

The father of the boy decides to celebrate, and takes his son out to a bar for the first time.  “Bartender, how about a beer for my son here!” he orders proudly. As he helps his son finish his very first beer, he is astonished to see a neck starting to grow out of the bottom of the boys head. “Hey bartender, hit me up with one more of those!” he demands excitedly. As the boy finishes off his second beer, both he and the father are amazed to see that a torso has grown out of the bottom of the boy’s neck.  Excitedly they order beer after beer, and from the boy’s torso sprout perfectly healthy arms and legs. For the first time in his 21 years of life, he has a whole body.

 He tries out his new arms and hands, waving them around and clapping. He stands up to test out his new legs. Although a bit wobbly from the alcohol, he is able to stumble around reasonably well. The father is brimming with joy and excitement as he watches his son hobble around the bar. Smiling, the boy shuffles out the front door of the bar and into the street, and right then a speeding bus smashes into him, killing the boy on impact. The father is shocked and speechless. Right as his beloved son was finally beginning to live a normal life, it was all over. In baffled disbelief, he looks over at the bartender, who shrugs and says “ehh, he shoulda quit while he was a head!”
