By chance I went looking for a flashlight sub 5 weeks ago and found this place unused.  On 10/27/2011 we re-opened for business and are now 500 strong and gaining.

For those submitting, please understand the spam filter is a little out of control and (according to the admins) will train itself over time.  Around 1 out of 3 submissions are getting caught right now.  I try to check as often as I can but you can also send a mod message to make sure I notice.  

In the near future on the sidebar there will be a list of links to the best Chinese hi-power/low-cost light sellers (cheap fun), the best high-quality light sellers (the real-deal lights), and an F.A.Q. for basic questions about lights and batteries - so stay tuned.


Thanks again everyone and keep the quality submissions coming!

I just got back from the shop with the prototype.

Keep in mind this is right off the lathe with a quick buff so there are scratches, and tool markings on it. 

http://i.imgur.com/8I8oW.jpg

[Size Comparison Photo](http://i.imgur.com/pmVUo.jpg)

I think in the final production the fins on the head will be tighter spaced, and a bit narrower. I will also play around with a striker bezel. 

The head in the final version will also be a bit smaller. This particular one was built with an XM-L in mind with extra material to assist in heat dissipation. 

So, lets hear it. What do you think?

**EDIT**: Alright, by popular demand the striker will not be on these lights. I am currently looking at doing a glow in the dark coating behind the optics since they are clear which will allow a good glow when turned off. I have already found a source for switches, GITD O-Rings, and GITD boots.

I would like thoughts on the thickness of the fins, I will also be adjusting the depth a bit. 

I'm still working on the optics as of now, and about 25% done for the UI which will probably not be in this generation, however, the lights should be upgradeable. 

**EDIT 9/16:** I'm waiting for the components to come in to finish development. Final product info will be released on the sign up sheet. On the sign up sheet I will want to know what tint of LED you want, what color tail caps, and if you have any special requests for the light so think about that for the next week or so till I have them assembled. I will try my best to accomodate everyone's request for small custom work. 

**EDIT 9/18:** Got the first shipment of components for the drivers, Still waiting on back ordered components. ETA 1-2 weeks. [Toroids!](http://i.imgur.com/aNLeW.jpg)

**EDIT 10/18/12:** Drivers are in the mail. Stay tuned. Sign up sheet will be posted as soon as I have it assembled! :)

**EDIT 11/29/12:** I have been running some thermal tests on the light to see how hot it gets with extended runtime. I am still working on this project, and the light will certainly be released. This is not for profit, and is just a side project I work on during free time so development may take a while. I am also working on a AA/Li-Ion light in addition to the 18650 version.

**EDIT 12/3/12:** Hey Guys, So I have recruited the help of a gentleman to assist with finishing the LED UI controller. I will update you guys again soon!",,False,self,t5_2qjmy,1354524030.0,,,True,t3_zlbn6,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/zlbn6/reddit_flashlight_prototype/,

1346122020.0,29,self.flashlight,yxvcd,How do you guys feel about custom reddit flashlights?,UnexpectedCompany,43,14,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/yxvcd/how_do_you_guys_feel_about_custom_reddit/,"Greetings /r/Flashlight,

I was recently tasked for two small projects to create an LED Drop in replacement, and some LED Flood lights which got me thinking about you guys.

How would you guys like a custom flashlight or beacon of some sort? My idea was a low cost ($20-30~) highly rugged light with a long runtime. 1, or 2 mode. I find beacons particularly useful when working in the dark so others can see me. Maybe you guys like unique lights, or just want a cool pocket light. 

I am not looking to make a profit, but more have fun and get some community involvement in a project.

If you're interested I'd like to know the following information:

* **Battery Choice:** AA/18650/CR123

* **Multi-Battery Operation?** Yes/No (Extension tube or alike)

* **Light Output:** 150, ~500, or 1000 Lumens?

* **Modes/Features:** Single mode, Beacon Light, or High/Low? Or maybe you want a two color flashlight? Red/White. If you could rate the priority of the flashlights features as well that would be great. Ex. 1. Multi-Mode 2. Price 3. etc etc

* **Price Range:**


* **Anything Else?**


Alrighty, I just did some pricing and heres what I came up with:

* Single RCR123 Compatible 3-22v 1A Driver

* Cree XP-E - 230 Lumens

* Knurled &amp; Polished Aluminum Exterior

* Rear Clicky


Assuming a run of 10 lights, not including shipping:

* $2.93 Aluminum - A bit more for an 18650 body

* $3.43/LED (Cree XP-E Cool White 5000k) 230lm @ 1A (Max)

* *$6.21/LED (Cree XP-G Cool White 6500k) 347lm @ 1A (451lm @ 1.5A Max)*

* $9.42 Driver

* $6 Switch, Optics, Wire, Etc

**Total: $21.78/Light @ 10 Quantity** 

Possibly as low as $17.36 @ 10 Quantity

Once an ""Official"" decision is made I will go ahead and start working on a prototype model. 

Edit: Pricing Estimate

**Update:** So I've spent the last few days going through massive quantities of datasheets, finding suppliers, and so forth. I have the drivers narrowed down to just a couple. There aren't too many drivers for AA lights, and I really want to get you guys a quality and inexpensive light which means no DX/no name drivers. This project is about designing the highest quality light I can make for as little as possible.

At the moment I do have a semi-prototype for the body. I will post photos as soon as it gets machined up.

Tritium slots were requests by quite a few of you so if you guys could throw me the dimensions of the tubes you want I'll work the majority size into the design for you.

**Sept 5th Update:** As it stands I hope to have an aluminum prototype within the next week. This is entirely dependent on how busy the shop is. Possibly tomorrow, or saturday is the estimate. Once I have the physical copy I will post the design for critique. Keep in mind it probably will not be the final design. I am in the process of ordering samples for the drivers to put them together for the first prototype. I have also been working with Craig at Illumination supply to get you guys the best deal on LEDs. Don't hesitate to post any requests, I will try to work all the requests in as the prototyping continues. 

**Requested Features**:

* Tritium Slots for 1.5 x 5mm vials [Let me know where you want them once I have the machined up body]

* GITD ""Everywhere and Anywhere"" - I found some interesting colors (Green, Aqua, Blue, and Red)

* XP-G2 LEDs [You got it!]

* Pocket Clip Ability

* Dual Mode High/Low

* Clicky Switch 

* Striker/Semi Striker (For allowing light out the sides when placed face down on table) [I'll see what I can do]

* Diffuser

* Tail Stand [Got this in the prototype]

I have been a fan of Zebralight for a long time.  Back in December I discovered the SC52, and liked what I saw.  I generally prefer CR123a lights, but wanted a light I could let my kid play with, and not have to think about burning through batteries, and also one that could handle leftovers from her toys that require primaries, but can't discharge them completely.  I think I got lucky when ordering, because they had *just* come off backorder, and went back to backorder right after I got mine (iirc).  They are currently on backorder now, it appears. :(  

Well the SC52 fits that bill for what I needed perfectly.  It works with AA batteries.  Bonus is that it also works with rechargeables.  I have a ton of Eneloops, so when I run out of mostly-discharged primary batteries, I can switch to Eneloops.  

What's the bonus is that it also runs on 14500 batteries, and instead of the max 280 lumens (which Zebralight claims is a record for AA), the 14500 will get **500** lumens!  I don't have any 14500 batteries, and quite frankly have found the 280 lm from the Eneloop to be plenty.

Let's get on to the unboxing.  It ships in a [pretty simple box](http://i.imgur.com/gquR53V.jpg), with a [""warning"" on entry](http://i.imgur.com/BRZCh2V.jpg) about the battery options and potential for performance.  


Inside, it's still [very simple](http://i.imgur.com/7yDvNpRh.jpg).  I think often people get too interested in the ""unboxing"" side of things.  It's just a box.  The light is protected.  Furthermore it's *supposed* to be a pretty tough little light.... Yes I want it to arrive in my hands in perfect condition, (and it did) but...  It's a freaking box.  Anyway, kudos to Zebralight for this box being recyclable!  Not some plastic blister pack (looking at you Fenix and FourSevens).  

The [light itself](http://i.imgur.com/9NgUHWy.jpg), is [quite nice](http://i.imgur.com/pJwmBOh.jpg).  I had a Zebralight headlamp (H31) for years, and really liked the aerosol type hold, but I like the traditional version too.  This light is not and can't be turned into (so far as I can tell) a headlamp.  I sometimes wish [the clip](http://i.imgur.com/zKAeSEY.jpg) was mounted the other direction, which would allow the light to go on the bill of a cap.  Not only is it *not* done that way, it's also screwed into a dedicated body fabrication.  So if you didn't need a clip (I don't ever clip my light anywhere on anything), taking it off leaves you with an unsightly *sharp* protrusion.  As close to perfect as the SC52 is, this clip *attachment* method just seems ridiculous to me.  Having said that, the clip itself is very snug and would be very trustworthy if you needed to use it.  One more thing: I feel like the screwholes for the clip are some standard center-to-center pattern.  So if you were inclined, you could probably find a true deep carry clip for the light, and it'd be pretty awesome.  I looked around a little but then realized that companies who sell clips don't list the dimensions of the screw holes very much, so it's pretty hard to guess which ones will fit.  Oh and I still don't use the clip.  

I find the activation button to be the perfect amount of recessed, and the perfect amount of resistance.  Zero complaints about that.  It's really good.  

The reflector is ""[orange peel](http://i.imgur.com/YWkOZT2h.jpg)"" style, which I guess keeps the light having some flood.  Anyway, it looks nice, and works fine.  If you want to throw light across a football field, you're probably carrying something else anyway.  Zebralight calls it ""80 degree spill, 12 degree hot spot"" if you're into that kind of thing.

One thing that really pushed me to buy this light was the desire for a ""low low"" (or ""moonlight"") mode.  The SC52 has that in spades.  The lowest it can go is ""0.01 lumens"" which is truly useless.  I don't say that negatively.  I mean it is truly so low that it is not useful in any situation I have found.  Even in a completely dark room, 0.01 lumens wouldn't help you to aim to hit the ground with your pee.  But Zebralight: I ain't mad atcha.  I'm **glad** it's there, if only as an exhibition to get me to shut up about moonlight modes, and trying to get manufacturers to go ""as low as possible.""  At the lowest setting, you can look directly into the LED die with the light one inch from your eye, and it won't bother your eye at all.  [You can continue to do that indefinitely](http://i.imgur.com/lp854Wvh.jpg)....  [That's low.](http://i.imgur.com/mPEKGaEh.jpg)  

Also, don't sweat the low.  ""Low"" has multiple settings, and can be set to a completely use*ful* [2.7 lumens](http://i.imgur.com/G3sxdfWh.jpg) or 0.34 lumens (which is also kind of useful, too).  

Of course there are a  couple [extra O-rings](http://i.imgur.com/SLbEMrR.jpg) in the package from Zebralight.  Cool.  This goes between the tail cap and the body.  Presumably there would be one between the crystal (which they call ""tempered optical grade glass"" - whatever that is), and the bezel, but I don't really guess this is meant to be user-serviceable.  I wish it was, and I wish some GITD O-rings could be had in there.  :)  You can see the O-ring here, with a [scale-reference AA battery](http://i.imgur.com/7zJrFYrh.jpg).  

I am not going to try to explain the User Interface.  Once you play with it for a few minutes, you'll get it.  High and low are easy to get to, and the other stuff I have needed is, too (really!).  It even has strobes (apparently).  

One **very** nice feature of this light is it's ability in the UI to check the battery voltage.  I didn't really know that's a feature I'd want much (especially in a ubiquitous AA light) but I find myself using it quite frequently, particularly when I'm about to be away from my primary battery source.  Just check the light and if it's low, pop a fresh battery in!  I can't stress enough how nice this is! 

This is not the smallest AA light out there.  I do think it's one of the more feature-rich AA lights, though.  I have found that the tailcap will back off once in a while, and when I attempt to activate the light, I initially think the battery is dead, only to realize the cap isn't tight enough to contact.  Not sure why this is, but it hasn't been a huge problem.  I also do wish Zebralight would fix the two issues with the clip (clean removal, and reversed attachment).  Fix those two things and I don't really know how you can beat this light.

Will the SC52 always remain my primary EDC light?  Well I have a Titanium Muyshondt Aeon on order (a light that was almost 7x the price of the SC52) and I have to tell you it'll be a battle to decide which to keep and which to leave at home.  However, as I said at the front of this review, this light was purchased primarily as a light my kids can play with, with out having to worry about eating through batteries.  So I might end up carrying the Aeon, and the kids get the SC52.  I still love the light after 4 months of daily carrying, and think it's one of the better lights Zebralight has come up with yet.  It also still looks brand new! 

Recommendation:  **Buy Buy Buy.**

It is actually not 300 lumens like the original poster stated and actually closer to 220+ (having a Q5 emitter).  FYI this is still very bright, especially for the money.  The discount code of ""wtcreec8"" still works.  Thanks to ZombieKingKong for the tip.  [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/mbziq/300_lumen_cree_5_flashlight_with_charger_and/) the original post. 

You get: the light, one 18650 battery, and one charger (with a cable going to the plug in for charging with a 4 ft. lead).

$17.99.  220 lumens.  Hi/Med/Lo/Stobe/SOS.  If you are new to flashlights and want a dirt cheap way to experience what the world of serious flashlights can do this is a great way to enter without spending much money.  If you need an extra light (and an extra 18650 battery and charger), $17.99 is well...just $17.99.

Expect 2-3 weeks shipping (from China).  Mine took 15 days to MN.  And for those who don't know - do not sleep with a li-ion battery on the charger.  They are too powerful and dangerous to not be awake while they are topping off  - just to be safe.

Recommendation for $17.99 of this level of product:  Get it.

It's not a top of the line Sure Fire or even a Four Sevens.  But to get into the game and pick up a very bright flashlight for cheap...you can't really go wrong.  For a gift or another for the collection, the value is there.

It has a well centered high power beam with a nice wide (and still well focused) spill light.  It's my new favorite discount priced light.  The run time claims 3 hours of use.  So far no reason to disagree.  Also, it has a larger(ish) head which I like.  It makes it less easy to lose in the glove box or a drawer.

A layman's explanation.,PinkFlute,28,6,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1cdu0d/stop_buying_alkaline_batteries_your_3_watt/,"I see a lot of people saying they like the idea of being able to replace their batteries in the field if they run out of power.  They usually are referring to the alkaline variety, and I just wanted to say that **you're throwing your money away**.

Alkaline batteries are awesome for low power, long term solutions.  They have plenty of capacity for smoke detectors, remote controls, and even *low output* flashlights.  They have a relatively low ""self discharge"" as well.

Nevertheless, they are an absolute waste of money for any modern LED flashlight that puts out more than 3 watts.  Some of you look at capacity ratings on batteries when you are shopping around.  You think, ""Oh nice!  This AA has 1800mAh!""

Except these ratings are done at a specific (lower) *discharge rate* or *amp draw*.  The more important aspect of a battery is how much capacity it has under *high load* applications.  For alkaline, it's crap.  Your average AA flashlight might be dying off in brightness after the first 15-20 minutes under just 1A load.  The high discharge performance is so bad that you can get NIMH rechargeable batteries with *a far lower capacity rating*, and you're almost guaranteed *more run time*.  Lithium ion and lithium polymer are also excellent at retaining their *rated capacity* during higher discharge.

**So in summary:** Alkaline batteries are relatively expensive, leak when left in a device, and they have crappy high output performance.  You're throwing your money away when you use them on a high power flashlight.

**Suggestions:** If you absolutely *must* have a flashlight where you can swap out with off the shelf alkaline batteries, and it's over 2 watts: buy Ultimate Lithium for primary (non-rechargeable) when you have the option, and use NIMH for secondary (rechargeable) for everyday use.

What's even better (in my opinion) is simply making the initial investment in a lithium cell flashlight, such as an rechargeable 18650.  In high drain applications, you can get as much output as 3 ""alkaline"" D cell batteries from a single one of these rechargeable lithium cells.  With the Alkaline batteries rated as high as 18AH, and the 18650 being rated around 2AH, it only goes to drive the point home that ""Amp-hour"" ratings are garbage when you don't factor in the voltage of the battery or how much power you will be drawing from them.

It stopped working and after a couple of emails Trevor told me to RMA it back to them. When they got it he told me that it had stopped working due to a battery leak which was out of warranty but that they would cover it this time. I received it back in the mail three days later and it was pretty much brand new.

I hope everyone has had a great new years break :) Plethora and myself have been discussing creating a list of flashlights that we could merge as part of the knowledge centre to help new users find a light of their choice. I've gone through the last 40+ days of posts, and i've written down every model that anyone has suggested. 

I've since compiled a list of nominations and sorted them according to battery size. I suppose before voting occurs, perhaps **people could please nominate flashlights they don't see on the list?** If you agree with that nomination that someone else has posted, could you please reply to that comment with +1 or something similar (instead of upvoting), that way i know who is voting for what (not just upvoting for contributing).

After nominations die down, i'll set up voting. If there are any more battery categories etc, please post so we can add those. The list below is what (multiple) people have suggested in this subreddit, not my personal opinion :)

The times when I needed a portable lights are when I use it around the house, or out in camping or climbing trips. Every single occasion it's been more convenient to have both hands available. The headlamp automatically points to the direction I'm looking at, and if I do need to hold it in my hands or hang it in the tent, I just take it off my head.

Secondly, why black? When the lights go out in the house, or it's dark outside, the last thing I want is a flashlight that's difficult to find in the dark. I purposely chose a white headlamp so it's visible when I need it.

I understand some flashlights have very high lumens where there may not be a headlamp alternative, which most people don't need or is affordable. However, in the mid range where both headlamps and flashlights are available, why do people chose flash lights, and why black? Is it simply because they look cool? From my experience they certainly doesn't seem more practical. I'm interested in hearing other people's thoughts on this.

---

Thanks everyone, I think I now have a better understanding of other's needs, the consensus seem to be:

**Headlamps are useful when working outside.** This is mainly what I use mine for, hence why I find them incredibly useful.

**Not as practical as flash light for EDC, headlamp is anti-social.** Agreed. I use my phone as flashlight in day to day situations, never needed anything brighter than that.

**Being able to hold in your hand is handy.** I hold my headlamp in my hand when needed.

**Better for self defence.** That's something I never thought of.

**Not as cool.** OK, I guess it was never a concern to me when I'm out camping.

**Black is stylish.** True, I thought the practicality would outweigh the looks. It does seem odd that black has the purpose of being more convert, but when you're shining a bright light, you're not trying to hide.

Overall, flash light is better choice for purpose of EDC, which I've replaced with my cellphone. Headlamps are better when you need to do work. Anodized black looks cool.

It served me well, and I grew to like the little thing. The fact that I had access to all the surefire batteries I wanted didn't hurt at all. When I was shipped home the last time I gave my picatinny clip to a buddy, and kept the light. I came home, and forgot about it for a couple years.

I found it in a box the other day, with dead batteries and the spring on the button at the back disconnected. I put the spring back in (some cursing helping me along), and replaced the batteries, but no joy. The switch seemed loose, and the lens was scratched to hell, and while looking on the surefire site I obtained a replacement for those, which apparently they give away for free. Good on them for their customer service, I'm pretty pleased they have an automated system for that.

I have discovered a need for a reasonably powerful flashlight in my EDC bag. I'm currently using a hardware-store $3 LED light that is made of plastic. I'd like to get this surefire up and running, so I have a tool I can depend on. I'm not a hardcore survivalist, and I treat my tools well, but in the course of commuting by bicycle and living in an urban environment I'd like to have something I don't have to worry about breaking in the course of normal activity.

Anyway I did some lurking here and it seems like a McClicky switch seems to be a popular modification, some sort of led bulb assembly is often recommended, and boring the barrel out is pretty popular. I have some questions for you fine folks, who know more about this than I.

1. Boring the barrel out is to fit it to a bigger battery, right? Where does one get that done? What does it cost? Would it be better to buy a new barrel?

2. Is the 18650 the best choice for a rechargeable, or are there other options for a 6P? Do those give a much longer service life per battery, or is that for brighter light, or is it just it being rechargeable that makes it desirable?

3. The LED bulbs seem to last longer and be brighter, is there any downside to using them over the incandescent?

4. Since I'm going to have a spare end-cap, I think I want to put that McClicky switch in one of them. Is McClicky a brand, or a style? Are some better or worse than others? Will I need special tools?

5. Is there anything else that I should think about doing to this? I don't really have an idea of what's available, and the mass of google results are frankly staggering.

I really appreciate the advice here. I've tried to do a bunch of learning but gaps keep coming up and I could really use a quick primer on what is possible.

AnAppleSnail shortly followed up with an offer of his used (but still quality) lights to help ""enlighten"" another member - shipped no charge.  This is the kind of community I'm proud to be part of.

The idea is to have a way for those fairly knowledgeable on lights to help out those who are new to what quality lights are all about OR just to give someone a new or used light because you'd like to see it going to someone you think would appreciate it.

Enter project:  ""Random Acts of Illumination""   
*(thanks to Geodyssey for the name)*

The proposed logistics:

* We'll set up a sidebar page in Google Doc's called ""Random Acts of Illumination"" for tracking the gifting events in order to motivate others to take part.  Gifter, Recipient, Item description (New/Pre-Owned), Date.  If the Gifter wants to remain anonymous - we will record it as ""Gifter: anonymous by request"". 
* If you want to send a light gift, PM the mod's with the name of the individual that you would like to send a gift to and you need an address for.
* We will contact that person on your behalf as mods of the site and get an address which we will relay back to you.  This way if someone turns out to be ""someone we don't want here for whatever reason"", I (or another mod) would know who and can take appropriate action as well.  This would also ensure the documentation of the transactions under ""Random Acts of Illumination"" for the benefit of the whole community.

All flashlight junkies have a bunch of extra old lights around that are still very decent lights but aren't in their rotation of use anymore.  This is a chance to give a gift to someone who will step up to another level in light appreciation from your actions of putting your unused quality lights to good use.  It can of course also be a new item.  All in all we get less sideline watchers, more passionate members, and Gifter's get: *real life karma* (you still can't spend it on Amazon though).

We are open on ideas of how to make this program work better so throw out any thoughts you have.

There will be no requesting lights as such a system would be ripe for abuse.  This is a new way to help out others when you see a certain someone that you feel like you could help improve their light situation and do a good deed at the same time.  Then you get to feel good in a way that upvotes can't touch.",,False,self,t5_2qjmy,True,,,True,t3_s52l9,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/s52l9/random_acts_of_illumination_rflashlight_real_life/,moderator

My mom loves her bingo, but doesn't like the really dark room that it's in, so I suggested we'd try a Glo-Toob. I'd never handled one, so I ordered one to try it. She liked it so much that she immediately took it from me and put it on her keychain. 

So then she noticed how her old little Fenix E01 was getting some sharp edges (seriously, I've handled Spydercos that were duller then the bezel on the Fenix) so we set about finding a replacement. 

Since I'm shopping for mom's light - and getting myself a Glo-Toob again - I might as well shop for others right? So I found some lights for my sister and brother as well. 

Well, the order's placed for: two Olight i3S EOS 1xAAA light (80 lumen on a keychain light? That's just insane...), both in blue for mom &amp; brother. Sis got herself a Thrunite Ti, again 1xAAA, 60 lumen, in green. And me? Glo-Toob FX in green.

We would like to think that the reason is we are trying to consistently improve while also seeking to give this sub a user-inspired personal touch to meet the needs of the members (while remaining as ""hands off"" as possible).  Sometimes this takes the ideas of more than a couple of people.

Thanks to all our members for following along here and never forget you can always PM a mod with your idea(s) at any time.  We are here to make this a better place for everyone. 

/r/flashlight is now officially at 1 year old (and a week or two).  The 4 year sidebar note is old code and waiting for another sidebar refresh from when I took it over from a banned spammer (we cleaned it out once but an update put it back).  

Now I am lucky to work with four fantastic mods that care about this place as much as I do.

It's a good size for me. Fits fine in the big pockets on my cargo shorts, and I'll always at least have it with my backpack.

I live on my sailboat and use my spotlight most nights. A few days ago I dropped it in the drink and discovered that it wasn't as water resistant as I thought, though in fairness it's about fifteen years old. So, I'm in the market for a new light. 

I hadn't realized how far the technology has advanced! Honestly I'm pretty overwhelmed by the options, and reading over the flashlight review websites linked to from the right column here, I'm not much better off. I am hoping that somebody here can help me select my next light. If anybody here would be so kind as to guide me I would sure appreciate it. 

I'll be using the spotlight for docking, identifying floatsam, signaling to a distance of about two miles, and working in tight spaces on board (e.g. the engine room). Because this is for marine use, it needs to be fairly robust and water resistant (something in the neighborhood of IP 55). Full immersion would be great, but I'm betting it's pretty darn expensive and I don't really need a dive light. If it can float that would be great too, but again is not a requirement. A lanyard attachment is required though. 

Most of the time it will be sitting in a charging cradle, used for a few minutes to maybe an hour, then returned to the cradle. It would be best if I could recharge on a 12v circuit; I'm sometimes not on mains (120v) power for a long time and I would feel silly to running the diesel just to recharge a flashlight :)

Thanks in advance for your help. Also, if you're in Seattle and want to go sailing, let me know.

UPDATE: What does /r/flashlight think of the [Streamlight Fire Vulcan LED](http://www.streamlight.com/product/product.aspx?pid=147)? Doing more research into spotlights, I came across a review of a half dozen or so lights by Practical Sailor magazine, and they recommend this light. Here's the skinny:

$150  
Bulb: 1x C4  
Brightness: 145 lumen, 740 lux at 30'  
Robustness: IPX7. 7 year warranty.   
Battery: 3 hours on high. Li-ion. Recharges on 12v or 120v, includes charger.   
Weight: 1.8 lbs  
Other: Includes a shoulder strap.   

I like the robustness, but I'm not sure if it's bright enough. ",,False,self,t5_2qjmy,1342735678.0,,,True,t3_wnvhs,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/wnvhs/marine_spotlight_recommendation/,

It's just about perfect in every way, and was what made me like twisty lights. Its only shortcoming is the relatively short runtime. With that in mind, I decided to buy a AA twisty. I searched around and found mostly favourable reviews about the Nitecore Sens AA. According to reviewers, 1.5 hours runtime to 50% on high was a reasonable expectation. After finally getting it a few days ago; however, I'm seriously regretting buying it. 

* I'll start with the brightness. Simply put, It's a lot less bright than I'd hoped. I get that it has more spill than my Ti, so I can understand why the hotspot doesn't appear much brighter. On the plus side, it has a nicer tint than the purple-ish Ti. 

* The runtime is nowhere near what I thought I'd get. Freshly charged eneloops got me about 40 minutes of 'high' brightness, after which the brightness rapidly declined. By the end of the hour it was only putting out the equivalent of its lowest setting.

* The UI kind of sucks. Specifically, the twisting action to get it to turn on sucks. On the Ti, it's about a 1/8th of a turn from off to full brightness. With this, it's more like several twists, usually made easier by the use of both hands. Often you think it's on or off, and it starts flickering.

* With regards to the accelerometer mode switching, it's pretty slow, but not a deal breaker. Unfortunately, quite often, if you want to turn it on to full brightness, it instead comes on to medium, and you have to turn it off and back on again.

* Lastly, the battery rattles when off. This probably wouldn't bother me at all if the light didn't have those other issues.

In conclusion, I really think I wasted my money with this one. I wish I'd bought the Ti2, or the Saber 1A instead.",,False,self,t5_2qjmy,False,,,True,t3_1km0uo,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1km0uo/majorly_disappointed_with_my_nitecore_sens_aa/,

I don't believe it produces that much, even the [spec sheet](http://www.cree.com/~/media/Files/Cree/LED%20Components%20and%20Modules/XLamp/Data%20and%20Binning/XLamp7090XRE.pdf) (1mb) claims 107 lumens.*

-------------------------------

So someone on the forums suggested i buy [this](http://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=m570.l2736&amp;_nkw=300+cree+led) flashlight (i can't find the person who suggested it, but it was somewhere in /r/flashlight). It's only $6 delivered, so i thought 'shit, why not' and bought one.

It arrived '[as is](http://imgur.com/a/WSuI7#7)' in a little plastic bag.it was quite bulky and feels quite firm in the hand. Remember it's only one AA battery. It's just wide enough that i can make a fist around it, and it fits quite neatly into the hand. The pocket clip is very tight. No way it's going to fall off your belt.

The last .5cm (1/5 of an inch) is what unscrews to get the battery in. The battery goes in fine, but the sold spring makes it difficult putting it back together. The switch itself is quite small, so it makes it a little fiddly to get the battery in.

Once it's in, the rear red button clicky is push-on, push-off. You have to push it fairly hard to make it turn on and off, so you won't have any accidental ""turn ons"" in your bag.

It has a [yellow triangle warning sticker](http://imgur.com/a/WSuI7#8) on the front which makes me feel totally 'bad ass'. The one thing to note is the glass lens does stick out [the front](http://imgur.com/a/WSuI7#11) which means it might be prone to getting scratches. But for $6, i'm not going to cry about it.

The one thing that took me a minute to work out, is the head of the torch pulls out slightly which allows you to focus the beam. Compare these two images if it doesn't make sense. [out](http://imgur.com/a/WSuI7#7) and [in](http://imgur.com/a/WSuI7#6)

When you turn it on initially, the torch head is in the ""in"" position, you get a very diffused white circle. It does create a bit of a [wider](http://imgur.com/a/WSuI7#14) halo, but is quite good. I can see this being useful when looking at a wider area. However in the 'out' position, it goes into a very narrow zoom, which is very impressive. You get the [square](http://imgur.com/a/WSuI7#13) beam which perfectly matches the [Q5 led](http://www.cpfreviews.com/Jetbeam-JetII-Pro-IBS/IMG_3091_JetII-Pro-IBS_LED.jpg) inside. The picture doesn't do it justice, the beam clearly shows the lines of the LED.

Is it waterproof? probably not. I didn't want to fully submerge it, but i have tested it in a bit of rain. I suspect the water will ingress through the adjustable head at the front. The rear threads look pretty good imo.

Summary: Pretty damn good for the price. The zoom is great and it complements my other ""wide beam"" flashlights well. It's something you could have in the car and it would be great for zoom and well as a reasonably wide beam for looking through the engine bay etc.

- Purpose: Probably not edc (a little bit heavy), but around the house, in the car etc.
- Size: pocket size, nice clip.
- Battery type: 1* AA battery (i use eneloops)
- Price: $5-6 delivered on ebay
- Lumens: at least 100 imo
- Switch Type - tail clicky
- Modes: on/off (one level only)

I don't really care too much about batteries, but I would like the light to have a decent lifespan (lasts for a few nights of occasional use on a camping trip).

As far as price, around $100, but I could spend more if the light is really perfect :)

I loved the flashlight actually.  Me and a couple of friends who have seen it with me call it the ""God of flashlights""

Not due to its illumination, its durability, But because the power of the plot killed it.

So,  I was curious if any of you knew what the type of flashlight it was.

Thanks!

(And added four new brands with 77 lights in the past four days.) I am wondering what you think of it.

An overview:

The biggest change was a major clutter reducer.  Only one filter may be open at a time.  It really reduces the amount of vertical scrolling you do.

A smaller clutter reducer was merging all the yes/no options into a single **features** filter.

The third most visible change was a small arrow button to the left of each model name.  Clicking the button expands every single detail of the model.  Now it is much easier to know everything about a light or compare the differences between two models.

And as a hint for what is in the pipeline next, I am adding links to the best review of each light.  This is kind of slow and a bit of a grind, so I'll be trickling out the changes instead of releasing a 100% complete update.

Like these changes?  Hate them?  Annoyed at something missing?

It really made me want something better. But i know next to nothing about flashlights.

Ideally it will be an L shaped flashlight, or even a flashlight with a 90 degree rotatable head would be perfect. Have good battery life while not sacrificing the light it emits. At the end of the day I would value the lighting power over the battery life. I don't mind if its 2-3 D battery's. Waterproof would be nice as well but its not a necessity. Rubberized grip over a metal body would be nice too, but i'm not to picky about it. If it offers some kind of clip to either attach to my shirt/jacket or hang from the roof it would be a welcomed feature aswell. The price point should be under 150$ Under 100$ would be even better. My father had a nice one from the military, the head didn't rotate but it was very practical.

Not to be condescending, just to clarify. by rotate I don't mean around the axis. i mean able to go from a straight flashlight to an L shaped one. Its not a required feature but I think it would be really cool.

I really don't know anything about flashlights, but I know that I want a really nice one to have in my car so I can always have light.

Well a little later we're pretty intoxicated and some of his friends are over. Typically he and I sit around and shoot the shit, play smash, or try to stick knives in his coffee table. Last night's knife of choice was a cleaver that I had used to cut a pizza. 

Anyway I stick it in the table at which point one of the newcomers decides that it would be fun to imitate me... with my Jetbeam. I'm not paying attention at this point while my light is laid horizontally on the table and I hear the smash as an overhead strike from the cleaver is dealt.

Anyway, so here's the extent of the damage done to the Jetbeam. This light is really amazing (not necessarily because of its damage taking abilities but I'm sort of moving into a pseudo review here). Very bright beam on its highest setting and a huge selection of modes for user-defined settings. I got it from Craig at Illumination Supply, took a little longer than I had expected, but he really made it up to me by upgrading the light I had chosen as well as throwing in a charger for the 18650.

* Battery type &amp; quantity: Rechargeable. Bonus points if I don't have to take the battery out of the light to charge it.

* Lumens: I honestly don't know the lumen scale well enough to say. The only thing more important than cost is being bright. My eyes have trouble adjusting to the dark, and I need it to be as bright as possible for walking around at night. So basically as bright as possible in this package while being reasonably priced.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions!

[Muyshondt Aeon](http://www.muyshondt.net/aeon.shtml) - A two stage CR2 twisty.

[HDS Systems High CRI](http://hdssystems.com/?id=Edc&amp;mType=Clicky&amp;mFamily=S&amp;mModel=E1S-Hcri) - A bombproof cr123a light that I have wanted since I knew anything about anything.  I ordered one in early February and HDS never got with me, and never shipped my light.  So yesterday (6/15/12), I canceled my order, and hope to get a refund.  Still unhappy about that.  :-|

[Sunwayman v10r Ti+](http://www.sunwayman.com/html/products/201203/84.html) - I have wanted one of these for a while because of the guy who makes custom pieces for inserting tritium vials in them.  Guys name is Steve Ku and runs [Veleno Designs](http://www.velenodesigns.com/) (though finding [him on facebook](http://www.facebook.com/VelenoDesigns) might be better).  

Anyway, the other day Tony at [everydaycommentary.com](http://www.everydaycommentary.com/) [announced](http://www.everydaycommentary.com/2012/06/flashlight-updates.html) that the Aeon was going out of production.  I was shocked, but being that it was on my list, I could not wait.  Since I already carry a [Quark Mini CR2, R5 Edition](http://www.4sevens.com/product_info.php?products_id=2197) (discontinued) I knew I'd love a CR2 light.  I ordered one.

Nine days later, I had already received my **Muyshondt Aeon**.  [Here is what I got.](http://imgur.com/a/zgkRG#0)

[**Package** as received.](http://i.imgur.com/cVOj5h.jpg)  Packaged fine.  It's a flashlight that I hope is very robust, so what difference this really makes I don't know.  You people like unboxings though, right?  Right? :)

The light comes with a... [**lipstick tube**, and two more donut rings (which are used since it's a 2 stage twisty).  And a brass split ring.](http://i.imgur.com/KtkRNh.jpg)  The brass ring, you'll notice later, matches the brass heatsink on the light itself, very nicely.

[The light.](http://i.imgur.com/sby3H.jpg)  You can see the brass **heatsink**, which is awesome.  This thing stays much cooler than the CR2 4Sevens that I have carried.  Much cooler.  As in, the 4Sevens gets hot, and the Aeon does not.  Don't know how much clearer I can be.

[The light, burning.](http://i.imgur.com/ppMjA.jpg)  That is the low stage but let's be realistic and say that my pictures aren't good enough to know the difference.

[Enrique included a **battery**!](http://i.imgur.com/ecg0wh.jpg)  This was unexpectedly nice of him.  That meant I didn't have to scavenge one or go to the store, even.  Also it's a good battery to boot. :)  You can see in this picture the **compression donut** that lets the two stage twisty work like it has to.  A kind of worthless pic, where you can [see down into the barrel](http://i.imgur.com/lpxGbh.jpg).

For your information, when I say ""two stage twisty"" what I mean is that (unlike the 4Sevens Quark Mini CR2 mentioned above) you twist this light, and you get low.  You twist *more* and you get high.  With the Quark, you twist to low, then twist *off* and back on and get medium, then off and on again to get high.  Quite frankly it's a crap ton of twisting, and I hate it.  Like the Quark, hate the UI.  However, it does offer the advantages of offering SOS, Strobe and possibly beacon (don't know, don't use that).  The Aeon has low, and high.  Low and high.  Twist more off and on off and on off and on whatever blah blah.. Low and high.  **Simple**.

[And finally, you see the tail cap, which has the opening for a split ring.](http://i.imgur.com/B6HWIh.jpg)  Now this is important, because the brass split ring that is included, fits in to the circular opening in the light itself.  Into the half moon area.  So what you have is a light that can be kept on your keyring, and also still **tailstand**.  Now the Quark Mini can tailstand too, but don't go concerning yourself that it's in any way better than the Aeon.

Since I expect more of you have played with the Quark Mini than the Aeon, I will tell you that the **beam shape** is quite different.  (No beam shots, sorry...)  The Quark has a much more floody beam, and the Aeon is tighter with a pretty solid hotspot.  Very useful for distance viewing, in my opinion.  

Furthermore, the **Aeon's low**, is just not incredibly low.  I like a moonlight mode (which I would call anything under 2 lumens, but hope is less than 1), and the Aeon doesn't have that.  This was my single concern with the Aeon.  Turns out I don't care a huge amount, now that this light is in my hand.  It's truly great.  Has an amazing heft to it.... the Quark just feels cheap now.  Hate to say that but really who cares, it *is* cheap (and just [go buy one](http://www.foursevens.com/product_info.php?products_id=2866), it's *cheap* like I said).  The Aeon weighs more, feels more durable, the knurling is better, looks nicer, is more well thought out... You name it, Aeon is better.  Tint on the beam is even better on the Aeon, but you can't really compare those two since one is an R5 and one is an R2 XR-E.  Quark has a bluish tint, and the Aeon is much greener, and I would call it much more natural.

The twisty part of this light has not really come to just yet.  It's still just **a little stiff** (that's what she said), but Enrique did already lube the threads, which again, shows incredible attention to detail.  As such I know these threads will loosen up and be just perfect.  

So, for **$125** (which **includes shipping**), I have a stunning light, and I am tickled.  My other ""best"" light is a Fenix PD20 (yeah, the original, like a boss), and the Aeon blows it away.  I recommend it, *if you can find any, since they're now discontinued.*.  

Now, as a separate matter, Tony over at everydaycommentary.com talked to Enrique when he knew the Aeon was done, to see if Enrique would be interested in doing a ""Final Run"" (as I call it, ""The Tony"").  Enrique is game.  But it's not going to be this light as described above.  It's going to be a **three** stage twisty *with a mother-freaking moonlight mode* and will not be aluminum, but *mother freaking titanium*.  [Here is the signup.](http://www.everydaycommentary.com/2012/06/aeon-final-edition-sign-ups.html).  I mentioned it before on here, and not trying to push anyone to it, but he requires 75 people signed up before he starts production.  And I just want to let you know this will be a collectors item, incredible light.

I am hoping that since some of you are more in the know about flashlights that you could offer me a starting point or know of the perfect light for me offhand. I will pay decent money for it but would prefer it to be as cheap as possible. The pocket-sized lights in hardware stores and wally world are all junk and not bright enough.

* **Purpose** - I will be EDCing this flashlight and using it for all kinds of illumination.

* **Battery Type and Quantity** - I am looking for a single AA or single AAA powered light.

* **Price Range** - No more than $120 but the cheaper the better.

* **Type** - Pocket and handheld. The smaller the better.

* **Lumens** - I am not familiar enough with flashlights to make a guess at how many Lumens I need. But my last EDC was bright as shit and could illuminate stuff a city block away or more. So I really want a blinding bright light.

* **Switch Type** - Buttcap, click on and off. I don't want a push to light type and I don't want the switch on the side.

I want the flashlight to be durable as fuck and at least mostly waterproof as I tend to fall in streams and break cheap flashlights in the middle of the night. I need the light to be bright as hell but I also need it to be able to be used for as long as possible without swapping batteries and I already EDC a lot of stuff so it needs to be small. Because many of the things I am looking for are in conflict with each other, I need to turn to some experts because I am lost at this point.

I'll do a full review at some point, but in the meantime: The brightness is no joke, using the switch on the body to toggle modes instead of multi-clicking the endcap button is **awesome**, you cannot twist the head to change the beam which I thought would suck but it really does not, the fact that I was able to get a rechargeable Li-ion batteries for it as well is **also awesome**, the build quality is extremely good, it is fully waterproof, partial press on end cap button turns on light while depressed, and the strobe alternates and is on full brightness and is ridiculously disorienting (I'll shoot a vid if anyone is interested)

Though it is a bit on the larger side for EDC but it can be done, it is not *that* big as it is still a compact light that in the left rear jeans pocket clipped in you can even still sit comfortably, and if you carry a backpack, briefcase or bag of any sort, there's obviously no problem.  But it is definitely not something you can stick fully inside say a front pocket.  That said, it does have the handy DNA collector on the front of it, and it has a design that prevents it from rolling away if placed on its side.  It also has a clip you can leave on or remove that is locked solidly in place wherever you want that to be.

If I were to have only one flashlight, this would be it.  Small enough I can carry it, yet large enough to be easy to handle.  Extremely tough, extremely bright and it can take two different types of batteries, the traditional CR's or a rechargeable.

There's been quite a bit of discussion about the heat issues on some of the Nitecore Explorer series, especially with the use of the constant red-light mode. Selfbuilt did a measurement of this mode. I noticed that my EC1 also runs fairly hot on the other modes, so I thought I'd test it with my inexpensive IR thermometer. I compared it to my Quark QTA, which is a 1xAA and 105 lumens, and my older Fenix E15, which is 1xCR123A and 140 lumens, and my Foursevens Mini ML XP-G2, which is 1xCR123A and 216 lumens.


Note that this is not very scientific, as I said, my IR thermometer isn't very expensive, it's a Ryobi I bought from home depot. I ensured that it's at least reasonably accurate by measuring the inside of my mouth.


I ran each test for 10 minutes or until the light reached ~110 degrees fahrenheit - I didn't want to burn myself or fry a battery, and I wanted room to spare - safety first.. I measured the outside of each flashlight on the side of the head and the body, as close to the center of each part as I could - my thermometer tracks the maximum temperature of each trigger pull, so I waved it slowly over the light and used the maximum temperature.. The flashlights were resting on their side. The temperature of the room was around 72 degrees.


Note that I was not holding the lights during these tests, so they were likely running hotter than they might if they were in my hand.


Foursevens QTA (XP-G), high: Head: 96.5, Body: 94.1. Warm to the touch, but not at all concerning.
Fenix E15 (XP-ER3), high - Stopped at 8.5 minutes: Head: 112, body 110. Very warm. I would have turned the light off or lowered it by now.

 

Quark Mini-ML (XP-G2), high: Head: 104, body: 106, battery: 95.

Nitecore EC1, red light mode: Head: 86.6, body: 87.0.

Nitecore EC1, high (NOT turbo): Head: 108.3, body: 109.0. I removed the battery after this run and it was up to 117.

Nitecore EC1, high (NOT turbo) #2: Stopped at 7.5 minutes. Head: 110, body: 109. Battery was 110.6.


Now, all the spec sheets I've read on CR123A primaries states that they should be good up to 60 celsius, or 140 fahrenheit, so at 117, there should theoretically be no real danger. However, the high temperatures make me a little uncomfortable. Only a little, to be honest. I don't usually run my lights on high for extended periods of time, and if I need lumens, I'll get a bigger light.


Another interesting thing I noticed: When I tested the batteries I ran through the EC1 in my ZTS Mini-MBT - I tried this on more than one - they tested at 100%, fresh out of the box, before I put them in. After running them for 8-10 minutes, and letting them get hot, they tested lower - one was &lt;20%, the other was 60%, but as it cooled, went back up to 80%. I'm wondering if one of the batteries I used was garbage. It was a surefire battery.


I'm not a huge fan of the temperatures the EC1 reached in high during my testing, although they don't seem dangerous.


Either way, I don't like that it heats up in the red light mode. The issue here, as other has noted, is that runtime is significantly reduced in the units that have this problem.


I've sent an e-mail to the company I bought the light from and I'm going to try to get a replacement.


I left the red light mode on for 20 minutes, and the temperature of the head is 95.7, body is 96.7. I'm going to leave it on for a while longer and we'll see where it goes.

***

***Guidelines for marketers:***

1.  You must present a substantial sale or other benefit at the time of the submission. The sale or benefit must last a minimum of 72 hours (3 full days) after the original posting. If this timeframe is not possible, contact the mods for specific approval.

2.  If you are submitting a link where you either own or work for the company (and have full authority to comment on its behalf), then it is required that you personally spend time answering the majority of members questions to the satisfaction of those asking as well as the mods while using a **real account with flair showing your site name. This promotes an education of flashlights, improved buyer/seller relations, and shows a sincere effort to earn a buyer's dollar.  In other words: If you post a sale - you need to be showing up frequently in BLUE responding to the sub's subscribers questions.**  Failure to answer questions will result in the promotion being removed and consideration of a ban for the submitter.  This is your chance to win over the members with customer service.  We do not know of a single sub that allows this...so take care of this sub and you may be rewarded with happy members and potential purchases.

3.  Professional posts are limited to **TWO* (2) per 30 day period**.  *Current allotment.


4.  If you do not own or work for the website you are promoting, the posting of sales you have found are acceptable and welcomed **as long as you have no monetary gain of any kind and are truly trying to share a good deal for the communities sake**. 
However, intentionally linking to something using *referral codes* on sites such as Amazon - will be treated as spamming . These types of posts are considered true spam and will not be tolerated whatsoever. Expect a ban for this type of submission. Check your link and remove the ""tag="" and everything to the right of the URL before posting Amazon links.  Those with this paid referral arrangement know exactly what we are speaking of.  

**That being said for all others, *please absolutely and frequently share great deals* when you are not affiliated with a company.**

***


In addition:

*  Our goal is to provide this community with the benefit of discounted prices as well as interaction with the merchants that provide the type of item we discuss: *flashlights.*

*   The moderators of /r/flashlight do not and will not accept any form of special consideration or additional discounts at any time. Marketers looking to influence the moderators by giving them something beyond what would normally be offered to the entire community will be immediately banned.  

*   This page is on the sidebar and will be annotated with any substantial member input.

*   Our intention is that these guidelines will help us all to get more out of this sub and separate a welcome marketer (guideline follower) from true spammers.

***
* **Business representatives - you need to register by responding to the comment below.  State the company you will be representing.  You also are entitled to flair which only marketers will have on this sub.  Your flair will be your website.  This removes all doubt as to any referrals you make as well as gives you official credibility when speaking on the behalf of it.**

""That's odd,"" I think to myself. 

Over the course of five minutes that sound keeps happening on and off and it's annoying as hell. I have drinks at my table so I'm carefully listening to each thing... none of those are the culprit. Then I'm like... is one of my batteries going apeshit? So I check my phone, my flashlight, my alarm clocks... nope. 

The sound, less frequent, occurs again.

..... Wait a second... could it be? I open my nightstand, where li-ons, nimhs, and some alkalines reside. 

TADA, three leaking AAA alkalines sitting in the corner of the nightstand, dated 2016. 

Not a huge deal but it was annoying, didn't leak much, but I have a tiny stain on the inside of the drawer. I don't think I even used them, and the only thing I can think of that caused them to leak is maybe it has been a little warmer than usual (26-30C) which makes me wonder how the hell people in warmer climates would get away with using batteries.

Size: Nothing strict, but three to four inches long would be my preference. Also, as light as possible as I plan on EDCing this (can that be a verb?).

Battery type &amp; quantity: 1-2 AA or AAA batteries.

Price Range: Here's where I become picky. Unless it's the best thing on the planet, I really don't want to pay more than twenty bucks for this. I don't *plan* on being lenient with the price but I can go over if you really think you have the best thing for me in mind.

Type: Handheld EDC flashlight, if that hasn't been made clear...

Lumens: I don't need to light up the world, but the brighter the better!

Switch Type: On the rear or switch. I don't like twisties.

Anything else: I want a pocket clip. I don't want to have a perfect circle beam like the River Rock flashlight I have now. But now that I think about it, the general size/weight/shape of the River Rock flashlight I have is ideal. I just don't like the beam and lack of pocket clip.

I recently discovered you guys and have enjoyed learning!

I live out in the boonies enough that there are no street lights nearby.  I walk my dog every night and it can be pitch black outside when there's no moon, so I went looking for a good flashlight that was relatively small, powerful, and used common batteries (ideally AA).

What I stumbled upon (not knowing much of anything about flashlights at the time) is [this] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006VPPERC/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00) - a cheap, non-branded Chinese-made flashlight that uses a CREE LED on a single AA battery.

At the time, the product description was for two flashlights, and the price was $11 (free shipping).  I saw most of the negative reviews were saying that some sellers were only shipping one flashlight instead of two, but that Amazon was making things right.  I figured I'd take a chance.

Though they took almost a month to get here (they actually shipped from China!) we ended up with a pack of two, as promised.  And I gotta say, they're incredible.  The ones we received have three modes (cycled through by half-depressing the button on the back) - high, low, and strobe.  The spread is pretty tight, and the end of the flashlight also pulls out to focus the beam tighter.  It's incredible to me how much light these things emit on high with only a single AA battery.  And, according to the production description, you can swap a AA for 1450 for even greater output! (I have not tried this, but numerous reviews on Amazon confirm this to be the case).

As for durability, I can't give you much info.  I've taken one under the house where it got dirty and banged around a bit, but neither have been through much punishment.

Since I bought these, the product description has changed and it looks like now only one comes in a pack, but I would gladly (and probably will) pay ~$9/piece for more of these to put around the house or even give as inexpensive gifts (like stocking stuffers).  I've seen some recommendations to other posters for ~$50 ~200lm flashlights, so I figure either I'm missing something (likely) or some of you might benefit from this option!

Now on to my recommendation request.  These cheap ~300lm flashlights are great for most tasks, but I'd like to invest in one, particularly powerful flashlight for things like looking 150ft into my backyard while it's raining to see if the tree limb I just heard fall landed on my shed.  

I like being able to use regular ol' AA batteries, so I'm leaning toward the [NiteCore EA4] (http://www.fasttech.com/products/1601/10001842/1209201-nitecore-ea4-cree-xm-l-u2-ha-iii-8-mode-860-lumen-) (saw a coupon listed in this sub last week).  But there are *so many* options out there I thought I'd check to see what others would recommend.  I'm looking for something that ideally runs on AAs, is as powerful as possible, and is preferably under ~$70 (though I would go higher for something exceptional, especially if it's going to last).

**Purpose:** EDC (mostly entails construction areas, office environments, mechanical spaces, and outdoors).

**Size:** Not longer than 6.5"" (16.5cm) and a diameter not larger than 1"" (2.5cm) (Both slightly negotiable.)

**Battery type &amp; quantity:** AA type preferred, AAA type would be second choice.  As for quantity...less than 3?  Both completely negotiable.

**Price Range:** Up to $100USD, but it would have to be very durable light w/ a warranty for that.

**Lumens:** Current EDC is 77 lumens according to website, would prefer something a little more.

**Switch Type:** Twist is preferred.  Buttons on bottom of the flashlight seem to be poorly thought-out when using a carrying case, as the light is inadvertently turned on.

**Anything Else:** Would prefer a light with a belt-holster **or** a durable metal clip.  Drop-In parts and relatively light weight (below 5 ounces?) also preferred.  

**Past EDC Lights:** Used to use a Lowes Taskforce 9LED flashlight (Very durable, very poor throw) with a bottom button that kept getting turned on accidently.  Replaced that with a [Mag-Lite LED XL50](http://www.maglite.com/maglite_xl50_led.asp) which was quite nice, except I had no carrying case.  That was replaced with a [Mini-Mag-Lite LED AA](http://www.maglite.com/AA_Cell_LED.asp) which is convenient, has a carrying case, but over the past two years has seemed a little lacking for it's brightness/throw, and the tail-piece doesn't seem to stay tight.

I'm trying to get everyone in my family on the eneloop bandwagon, so lots of eneloops are going out for gifts this year. The question is, which charger should I get for people? Most of the people that will be using these really don't care about things like charge rates and capacities. So, even if I get them nicer chargers like a LaCrosse BC-700 or Maha C9000, they'll probably just end up using them on the default modes.

The biggest priority is safety - I don't want anyone to overheat or damage their cells, which is why I like the Maha and the LaCrosse. They have extra fail-safes to reduce risk of overcharging/overheating.

Here are the advantages/disadvantages I see of the chargers I'm looking at:

**Maha C9000**: Great overall charger. I own one. Good for safety, because it has a time limit, temperature limit, and detects -dV reliably. Individual channels. Default charge rate is 1000ma, which is good for AAs, but not as good for 850mah AAAs.

**LaCrosse BC700**: Another great charger. I own one. Has thermal sensor, time limit, and -dV. Individual channels. Default charge rate is 200ma, which seems to work fine for eneloops, but is a little slow and could potentially miss -dV.

**Sony BCG34HRE4KN**: Reviewed well on Amazon. Charges at 640ma or 1050ma depending on number of cells. Individual channels. Dead simple, no settings to need to worry about. Some people have complained that it gets hot. Don't know how it terminates charge, or what fail-safe features it has.

**Sysmax Intellicharger i4**: Reviewed well, reasonably priced. Individual channels. Chargers at 500ma/1000ma depending on number of cells. Don't know what fail-safes it has. Does not appear to have thermal sensors.


So, I'm leaning toward the LaCrosse because it's about $10-20 cheaper than the Maha, more compact, works well, but still has some level of safety features and charge/cycle customization when needed.

Are there any models I'm missing? What else should I be considering? I'm really looking in the $40 and under range if possible, but the C9000 is such a great charger, I might spring for that instead.

A while back, I had a similar light which used the same (or similar) batteries.  I remember putting them in the charger overnight to charge and the next day, they were completely dead.  Not only that, but after using them in the flashlight, it seemed like the lighjt wasn't working propoerly (low output, flickering) after putting in a fresh pair of batteries.

My headlamp history goes: OLD REI headlamp. It was my dads in the 80s. Took 4xAAs and probably lasted an hour. I took it to Philmont where I accidentally left it on one night and no more headlamp.

When the first LED headlamps became ""cheap"" I got a [Princeton Tec Quad](http://www.rei.com/product/839774/princeton-tec-quad-headlamp) for Christmas. (2001/2002 ish.) It served me very, very well. Camping trips. Backpacking. Packing the car at night. It hung on my rear view until some leaky batteries sent it to its grave.

In 2011 I got a [Petzl Zipka](http://www.petzl.com/en/node/16783) for Christmas. It has served me equally well. Packing bags. Finding my way around stuff at night. It did its job.

I then went through my dark years. Slutting around with $3.99 LEDs ""headlamps"" from Meritline or DealExtreme. Crap that would break after a week. The batteries in it were as valuable as the headlamp itself so I dealt with it.

Then I came into some money and ordered the [Zebralight H51](http://www.zebralight.com/H51-Headlamp-AA-200Lm_p_37.html) and suddenly it all made sense. This thing is the Nokia 1100 of headlamps. (I could bludgen animals to death with it and it would be ok). The levels are head on with other measurements. Medium Low (30Lm) is about where my Zipka is. And it goes to ""can see my hands on a moonless night"" low where It's perfect dropping around my neck and shining on my hands. I can see everything I'm doing and not blind the world.

The spread and color are dead on to what I'm used to with the other LEDs. I was putting everything off worrying about color and floody, wide, flood, spot.

I recently got a job as a pest control technician, mainly termite treatments. I have owned a [Foursevens Quark X 123 Neutral](http://www.4sevens.com/product_info.php?products_id=2755) for a few months, and love it to death. It's great for a compact and bright EDC, but I need something more for my new career. Something that I will use every day for hours a day.

My main complaints with the Quark are that it has such a huge spread, not good for throwing the beam across a crawl-space, and the short battery life. I have to replace them every few days. I try and keep it on medium(65lum) when I can, about 50% of the time. The other 50% is spent on high(160lum) or max(360lum). Maybe if I get something with better throw, I won't need it as bright and I can get better battery life?? I don't mind getting something a little larger in size. I might even consider something with variable focus. I switch between looking at things far away and close up pretty frequently. If my requirements are not possible to meet, maybe I can get rechargable batteries and just charge them in my truck between houses?? I am up for any ideas.

I've been eyeballing the [Sunwayman V20C](http://www.sunwayman.com/html/products/201106/52.html)(infinitely adjustable to put it at the perfect brightness I need to see for longer life??), [ZebraLight SC600](http://www.zebralight.com/SC600-Cree-XM-L-750Lm-Flashlight-18650_p_55.html)(is 5.9hrs at 200lm good?), and [EagleTac P20C2](http://eagletac.com/html/p20c2/specs.html)(10 hours at 110lm). Looking for other recommendations and suggestions, and feel free to ask any questions at all if it will help you make a recommendation.

This is my first post here and need some help choosing the right flashlight.  I don't really know too much about them other than having an idea about lumems.  I'm looking for a sturdy flashlight that can withstand the recoil of a gun.  There are plenty out there made for that purpose but I think they mark up, the price pretty high and if the price isn't high it gets really bad reviews.

Is there a standard flashlight that is known for its ruggedness that can hold such a recoil and would be around 50 bucks?

Anyone considering buying these types of lights/batteries from sites like DealExtreme, eBay, etc should be very aware.  There is a definite danger from attempting to use multi-cell li ion flashlights.  They can short on you.  The Protection Circuit Board can be faulty, especially in these low dollar Chinese manufactured cells.  The flashlight can explode in your face.

Here's the first ~~four~~ five lists that we will have for our benefit:

FIRST list will be the high-quality lights manufacturers links such as Surefire, 4Sevens, and such. This should be their main site and not a selling site if possible. With companies such as 4Sevens there is no way to avoid this of course, so we'll just have to do our best.


SECOND list will be sellers of assorted high-quality lights and accessories.

THIRD list will be cheap Chinese sellers to help get people into the sport and enjoy high-power affordably (and hopefully on their journey to high-quality).

FOURTH list is FAQ, general info, battery info, etc. sites.

FIFTH list is mountain bike (and road bike) related.

Please include the list number(s) with the site(s) you personally recommend.  This is a good time to throw out all your recommendations so this info can be boiled down into something useful for everyone - especially newbies.

So I've been really bothered by just how annoying it is to buy flashlights.  I've tried to make the perfect site for the flashaholic who knows what they want.  Its got a database of **complete** specifications and lets you check off everything you find important.

Here is the homepage with a little video overview:

http://parametrek.com

Let's say you are looking for a light that weights under 250 grams (with batteries) and has a throw of at least 250 meters and runs on 16850 cells.  [BAM!](http://flashlights.parametrek.com/index.html?battery=1x18650+2x18650+3x18650+4x18650&amp;throw=250+756&amp;weight=10+250)  There are two by Fenix, one by Nitecore and two by Jetbeam.

In the past I'd spend hours going over specs to try to find the perfect light.  This just took seconds.

Biggest problem is that the database is incomplete.  It maybe has a quarter of the major brands.  I'll keep adding more (takes around one day for each brand, any faster and my wrists kill me), but if you guys have a preference for something, it'll be added first.  [Vote for those here.](http://flashlights.parametrek.com/flashlights-vote.html)

Edit: Sunwayman was the most popular request (two of two votes, a landslide!) so all 35 of their models have been added.

Ok, here we go. The torch i'm reviewing today is the LED lenser p2 $17 (@ Amazon US) and around $25 in Australia (Aus-tax)

[here](http://www.ledlenser.com.au/products/high-performance-line/p-series/p2-bm/) is the link to their official website.

TLDR version of the specs

16 lumens, 1*AAA battery, 7h, keychain light.


[Imgur album link](http://imgur.com/a/AjTuT#0)

So you get this small-ish torch in a well presented case. Rather reminds me of the maglite solitare we all seem to have.

What do you get?

- P2 flashlight
- Led lenser sticker
- instructions/warnings/advertisment for products
- Wrist strap
- Belt Pouch
- Clip on pocket clip.

Everything is pretty standard, but the [belt pouch](http://imgur.com/a/AjTuT#6) doesn't have much substance to it. Reminds me of one of those cheap belts you get off ebay.

So when i turned this thing on, i was kind of expecting it to be as shitty as a maglite solitare. To my surprise it packed a reasonable punch for such a small device. I'd love to do a test on the battery, 7 hrs is a pretty big claim for what it pushes out.


Here are some beam shots at different heights.

[1 ft](http://imgur.com/a/AjTuT#10), [2 ft](http://imgur.com/a/AjTuT#11), [3 ft](http://imgur.com/a/AjTuT#12)


The end also slides out (less than 1/3 inch), softening the beam

[hard](http://imgur.com/a/AjTuT#13), [soft](http://imgur.com/a/AjTuT#14) (same height)

Uses: I wouldn't be using it for walking long distances, basically walking to car, find keyhole, power goes out etc etc

Summary: Not a bad little light. A good alternative for a maglite solitare, however is a little bit longer than the maglite. On the bright side, it makes up for it with a stronger light with a better throw. 

Would i get one? yeah, if i didn't already have a solitare. But it's not going to knock your socks off.

I want to upgrade the bulb to the brightest possible single-mode LED. Like offensively bright. I've googled a little bit and I see drop-ins from a few third parties. Surefire brand drop-ins seem expensive, but possibly worth the money for build quality.


What are my options?



EDIT: Purpose of the light

I work hotel security on grave shift. The hotel is an atrium setup with balconies on the inside. Think of a square, with the rooms on the lines of the square and a large dining/deli/fake forest/fountain area taking up all of the inner space. So I want a tight brightspot to be able to single out rooms during large events (youngsters like to hang out of the balcony and yell across the way during sleeping hours). Patrols inside and out, with a parking garage and vegetation along the perimeter. I'd like to be able to illuminate and identify people/objects further out. 

EDIT 2: http://i.imgur.com/QF4hq.jpg
That's my light. In Mosul, Octoberish 2005. I strapped it on with velcro before I was able to get a proper rail mount for it. Also the positioning was just right that I could hit the switch with my thumb because I had my offhand on the mag well.

I had a few questions about 4Sevens lights. How does the quality compare to Surefire or Streamlight. Where is the best place to purchase them from? I can't find many online sites that carry them, and very few on ebay. Should I order directly through 4Sevens? Thanks

I have read most of the side bar, and been looking at some of the suggested brands (Mainly foursevens &amp; EagleTac) for a light. The [Quark Tactical QT2L-X](http://www.foursevens.com/product_info.php?products_id=2942), [D25LC2 Clicky](http://www.eagletac.com/html/d25lc2rc/specs.html), and the [
P20C2](http://www.eagletac.com/html/p20c2/specs.html) All seem to be about what I am looking for. 

I need a light for general purpose/EDC use so a balance between flood and throw leaning more towards throw if anything. Lighting up dark rooms, small spaces, camping, hiking, automotive work, etc. I have a budget around $100 and need to get the light, batteries, and charger for this. Can anyone see where either of these wouldn't be up to the job? 

Now for the questions. Do most lights in this category come with batteries? How long can I expect a $100 light to last me provided I don't abuse it? Does anyone in the industry have a lifetime or long term warranty?

I think my all time favourite light is the nitecore d10.  It was the perfect form factor, great piston/button placement, decent amount of light and beam with a decent batterylife.  The only bad thing I found with it was pocket carry as it would get accidentally turned on and you ended up with a dead light.  

Maelstrom g5(I have no clue where mine went after my move, so pissed about it)  This was an amazing light, the throw was the best and the battery life was amazing.  I could be standing on street level and just hit room in a condo waaaaay above me.  This is my second favourite light of all time.  The clip that came with this was kind of crappy and useless I never used it.  The pouch this one came with was also quite useless as I had replaced it with a niteize stretch holster which didn't fit my belt and the thing fell apart (I did email nite ize they just ignored me.) This light was great but it wasn't pocket carry unfortunately. 

KuKu 44dd - Another amazing light, it is the tiniest light with qtc. The throw/spread is enough to light up a small room.  I've had this light for a while now and while its a great light with a weird battery.  I can't bring myself to use this one, i may eventually trade it away or it'll become a shelf queen. 

Quark aa - Decent light, wasn't one of my favourites however my fiancee loved it.  She thought it was the perfect size for her purse and thus she carries that one around all the time.  It had a great UI and great modes.  I disliked the twisting of the head because no matter how much lubrication I used on it the thing would still be stiff as a board. This light had a decent amount of throw, in fact I think it out threw my d10 and another amazing feature was the fact it could take multiple voltage batteries in the aa size format. As usual AW's batteries are the best. 

ITP/and that company that won't ship to Canada's light the small aaa version, the size was good, choice of battery was great, throw was okay for a light that size.  The pain in the ass part was the mode switching.  I hated the fact the light came on medium then low to high or was the other way around? oh well doesn't matter I never used it, I may have gifted it to someone who liked that set up.

arc aaa/uv - This is another amazing light. Expensive but hell does it work. Great run time and great flood light for a small area. Indestructible as I've had it on my keychain and dropped it on the floor. I would totally recommend buying one of these. 

I believe I bought the zebralight aa headlamp can't remember what the model number was But I believe I paid 64 cdn for each of them.  I bought one for my fiancee as we wanted to replace her black diamond head lamp and my petzl one.  It throws, and generally is a decent light, may I use it on high more often then not it tends to run out of juice quite noticeably fast.  I also lost one of these in the move, grrrr.  Anyways one really annoying thing about this light is that when you turn it on it has a preflash.  Never liked that about this light.  Although the UI is good and the programable part is likable. 

Novatac 120p This is a great little light, runs off of cr123 batteries.  I didn't like the button switch this one came with. The throw was okay and overall this wasn't a light I warmed up to.  I used it for a few weeks in my rotation but it just never worked for me.  Maybe I needed the tactical tail. who knows. 

Preon 1 ti - Great size, horrible threads, great battery, horrible clip(lost this one too.)

surefire e1e - amazing build, great light but didn't wow me to the point where I would keep it. 

eagletac mc2x4 I believe was the model number.  Nothing to say other thing a GREAT light for the car or house.  Its a bigger light but the throw outshines my g5. 
 
coast - I'll never buy one again, I can't remember what version or model number this was but I remember paying 60-80 cdn for this one and while it had a great run time the main problem was the 3 aaa battery configuration, had the hardest time to replace the batteries in the dark.  The on/off button eventually crapped out on me so it was like a lottery spin to see if it would work again.  No I didn't sent it back to coast as there are many better and brighter lights so I didn't feel the need to actually fix it. 

Batteries.  I also choose aa/aaa over 123 for my edc lights, however for specialty lights I'll be willing to use 18650.  My reasoning is lights that use 18650 are for sure able to use rechargables.  Where 123 can be primaries only for instance the muyshondt nautilus.  For americans the purchase of bulk 123's is cheap however for Canadians the 123 battery is marketed as a photo battery and shown here

http://imgur.com/miOlg

We can buy in bulk from the states however crossing the border customs will take a chunk. 

I prefer 1 battery over 2 for edc as it makes it quite simpler and hassle free to change the battery in complete darkness. 

I prefer throw over flood as you can easily convert throw to flood like a waterbottle cap over the d10's head.  However it is much harder to convert flood to throw out in the woods. 

I probably have had a few more lights that I don't recall.  I don't have anything to say about the higher end lights ie. spy 007, McGizmo's, promethous as I can't afford those lights and even if I save up I can't bring myself to edc a light of that calibre as I've lost lights

He eventually got me one and I had used it for numerous years until some bad batteries took the whole thing out. I went through some cheap chinesium headlamps for a while but got fed up with the cheap plastic constantly breaking, weak output, etc. 

It was eventually replaced with a [Zipka](http://www.flashlightreviews.com/reviews/petzl_zt_plus.htm). It's ok, but unless you have to have a headlamp it's kind of annoying since I'd say 40% of the time I'd just wrap the head band around my wrist and use it as a hand lamp which is very hard with the retractable head band.

I then stumbled on the 'new generation' of headlamps, LED technology and I'm looking at getting a Zebralight, the problem is finding which one. I love the dual design of a flash light + head lamp plus the specs on any of them blow the Princeton Tec out of the water.

The first internal debate is AA vs 18650. With the run times on the 18650 I'd only need to carry 1 spare but there is always that one time you just want to grab a AA from any Walmart out there. Does anyone else run exclusively non-standard LiOns? How has your experience been with them?

I like the throw of the ones I've used, can someone here say if the regular or flood is closest?

Or Is It Just My ITP?,shadowfirebird,11,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/uubuc/twist_switch_lights_are_they_all_fiddly_or_is_it/,"My EDC light is an ITP A1 EOS.   Really, it's everything I want: 190 lumens for three hours, less than 3"" long, solid steel and a reasonable price.  

Except: is it just me?  Or is it just this light?  But trying to get the mode I want first time is almost impossible.

What is supposed to happen is, it starts in low.  Turning it off and on switches to medium, and then again gives you high.  But what actually happens is you get momentary contact as you twist the light.  So, it'll probably start in medium, and then next time it will be low, and then ... basically I get modes at random, unless I hold the light very still and get lucky.

I wonder if this might be the spring.  It seems very weak.  OTOH a stronger spring might make it worse, not better!

1) Does anyone with a Quark mini, for example, get this problem?

2) Can anyone recommend some sort of hack that might help me make the EOS more user-friendly?

I use this light so much that it's time to buy a backup.  I'm wondering whether I should spend my money on something different.

Thanks.

**EDIT: Smug Mode Engaged**

I think I've just fixed my EOS.

I bought a £1.60 crappy torch at Tescos (US translation: Walmart / Target) with about the same barrel diameter, sawed the thing in half(!) to get to the back end and removed the spring.  Then replaced the spring in the EOS with that one.  It appears to now work as advertised: low then medium then high.

If you want to try this, bear in mind that the spring in my EOS was really weak, hardly a spring at all.  And you'll need to avoid torches with a switch at the base, probably, because they might not have a spring like that.

CON: the spring is not a perfect fit so changing the battery is a bit more fiddly now -- but the other thing that never leaves my keyring is a Leatherman Squirt PS4 ;)

CON: obviously this places more pressure on the thread keeping the head on the torch.  But that seems well engineered on the EOS and probably a low risk.

I think my backup torch will, in this case, be the Foursevens Quark Mini.  If it happens to suffer with the same problem, I know what to do :)

It's a two-stage CR2 twisty.  Beautiful design, incredible operation, great UI.... and it's tiny, being a twisty cr2.  

So, it was announced (in a round about way) recently that this light is going out of production.  Enrique (Muyshondt maker) confirmed this.

Here is the kicker.  Tony over at [everydaycommentary.com](http://www.everydaycommentary.com/) talked to Enrique, and it was decided that if demand is there, a *final run* of the Aeon will be made.  

Not just made.

Made special.

It'll be a titanium version, but *three* stage, with a moonlight mode.

Right away when I heard the Aeon was going oop, I ordered mine.  But when I heard about this special version... I can't say no.  Titanium gives me a funny feeling in my pants area, and the moonlight mode has the same effect.  I can't not have this light.

Enrique needs 75 confirmations in order to get this light into production.  I believe we can make that happen.  Retail cost on the regular Aeon is $125, and Enrique says he's hoping to keep the Ti version (or the ""Tony"" as I call it) under $400 (usd).

So, how many orders can we confirm.

Legally speaking, you aren't allowed to carry any sort of knife on you (or any other ""cutting weapon"" in general, i.e. scissors, swiss army knife). It is absurd, both that and the fact that there is no knife pre-emption in PA, although I think few states actually have it. Regardless, I'm not old enough to get a LTCF yet, so even when I do I don't know if I would CC on campus because it violates my school's policies. Although if I ever got in a SD situation, I'm fairly sure it wouldn't happen on campus. 

So, I still carry a knife mostly just for practical EDC uses, but I was thinking of getting a nice, bright, and ""tactical"" EDC flashlight that I could carry for some sort of self-defense application. The whole idea seems a bit silly when I imagine explaining it to people because I'm not sure how many people out there actually do that. And it seems a bit extreme to me too. But hey, I'm just looking for an excuse to get a nice flashlight.

I'm fairly sure I'm gonna get a 4seven's Quark X 123^2. I got my father a Quark Tac 123^2, but then I learned about the X model with XM-L and then there's a regular version without 4Seven's Tactical UI. Although I'm not sure which UI I'd go for.. The Tactical one is obviously great for self-defense, but I really disliked it on my father's light because you can't practically switch between the other 6 or so modes. That's a self-preference decision though. 

So, flashit (don't know if there's a hybrid term for /r/flashlight's redditors, first post obviously) what do you think? What other options are there. Budget wise, I'd like to stick around the price of the Quark, but I just want to hear suggestions in general. And mostly, what do you think of the whole premise.

1324708357.0,9,self.flashlight,nowaf,Help me find an affordable all-around flashlight that I can also use for biking in the city?,toohyetoreply,9,0,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/nowaf/help_me_find_an_affordable_allaround_flashlight/,"After lots of searching I can't really find what I'm looking for. I'm not really looking for something super powerful, just something that can be diverse as possible so I don't end up with a zillion flashlights. Right now I don't have ANY flashlights, and I'm going to start commuting by bike soon so I thought I can kill two birds with one stone and get a light that I can use once in a while (maybe for emergencies) but mostly for biking. Although if this is not possible, maybe you can recommend 2 flashlights that I can get instead?

Ideally I would want something that runs on AAs, has adjustable brightness, and adjustable focus. For city biking, I don't really need to illuminate the street that brightly because of street lights, I just need it to last a while (probably 6 hours to be safe?) and has a wide angle as to increase visibility. It would also have to be weather-proof.

Most of the lights I see are really narrow and super bright, which would just blind other drivers, not even be that visible from most angles, and only light up a small section of the street.

SO I probably need something with adjustable brightness, focus, but doesn't cost a fortune (max $30). Does it exist? Can you recommend 2 flashlights instead that come out to about the same price? (one dim/long runtime/wide focus, another bright enough for emergency use)

EDIT:

Okay, it seems like the adjustable focus on most flashlights is basically useless, so I'm okay to drop that criteria. The [Maglite XL200](http://www.amazon.com/Maglite-XL200-LED-Flashlight-Black/dp/B005EHL6O8/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324762376&amp;sr=8-12) seems like a good suggestion because it has a good beam pattern, adjustable brightness (so I can run it a long time on medium power, and also have a bright light if I ever need it), and it's about $30. 

I'm also just thinking of getting the [mini maglite LED](http://www.amazon.com/MAGLITE-SP2201H-Flashlight-Holster-Black/dp/B000HFBR1O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324762376&amp;sr=8-1) since it will probably be good enough and it's cheap ($18), so unless someone can suggest a similar performing flashlight for cheaper, or a better performing flashlight for the same price I think I will stick with that.",,False,self,t5_2qjmy,True,,,True,t3_nowaf,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/nowaf/help_me_find_an_affordable_allaround_flashlight/,

I also like the 2AA setup as they offer enough juice for decent run time based on what i've read comparing them to single AA or AAA setups.  I'm pretty lazy about recharging batteries, and am not excited about spending $$$ on the specialty batteries like the cr123's.

I am a guard who works exclusivly night shifts. I have worn out the button of my shitty 2xC cell flashlight, and am looking to get something to replace it.

People on my shift carry all kinds of things, including a 4xD cell maglight. Bear in mind, length and weight for thumping people is essential. I haven't done it yet, but should the situation arrise, I am not going to stuff my 1 AAA cell light up their nose and hope.

I have been looking around and I have seen the [Olight S65 Batton](http://www.olightworld.com/product_show.asp?id=250) which seems to be designed with my use in mind.

The things I like about it are:

* It takes AA cells.
* It has a high and a low power mode.
* It is long enough that it has decent leverage should I want to clock someone with it.
* It comes with a belt pouch for a regular carry.
* The on/off switch is on the shoulder near the business end, rather than tucked away at the butt. This is esential for momentary on/off use and one-handed use.

I don't like that it is not flaired on the end, and thus unsuitable for a ring on my belt. I do not like that I will have to cycle through three modes with turning it on or off. I can't tell by looking at it if it is a three stacks of 2 AAs or two stacks of 3 AAs. Longer and thinner is better. If my current 2X C cell flashlight was 3x C cells, it would be pretty much perfect.

I am willing to be convinced to use rechargables, but right now a box of AAs in my bag works very well for shift and is no trouble to get replacements.

You will notice that enough lumens to blister paint is nowhere on my wish-list.  I have worked with 25 lumen flashlights, and they were okay. 100 would be better, but battery life trumps retina searing power.

Help me out flashlight nerds. I am sure I am not the first person to want to use a flashlight this way. What is the gold standard, and what is the cheap verson of that?

[Review from Budget Lighting Forum](http://budgetlightforum.com/node/16742)


A discount coupon appeared the other day, offering the Nitecore Ea4w for $45 shipped and i figured, hell why not. It was particularly attractive to me because it take 4 AA batteries (which i have quite a few AA eneloops). Some people don't like AA, but i prefer them, as i go into the field/camping and sometimes rely on disposables.

Comes in two versions, [White and Neutral](http://www.nitecore.com/UploadFile/Images/product/EA4/1-1_EA4_En6.jpg). 

Anyway, so lets have a look at some specs.



* Dimensions: Length of body - 117mm, the head part - 40mm diameter - 40mm.
* Weight: 159g (without batteries)
* Light source (LED): 1 LED cvetodioda - Cree XM-L U2 (options white and cool white)
* Maximum luminous flux: 860lyumen
* Focusing the beam: no
* Digital stabilization current: yes
* Reflector Material: Aluminum T6
* Reflector surface: smooth (smooth reflector)
* Lens material: tempered glass with double-sided anti-glare coating, scratch-resistant
* Coating: Army Premium Type III anodizing
* Button: on the side of the cover
* Waterproof Rating: IPX-8
* Maximum depth: up to 2 meters (provided much silicone rings bolted)
* The maximum range of the beam: up to 283 meters (at standard conditions)
* Number of operation modes: 7 modes (5 modes of brightness, SOS and Strobe)
* Max lumens- 860 lumens


It comes with: http://imgur.com/a/tdOi3#0

* brand bag for carrying a lantern
* spare silicone o-rings
* strap on your wrist
* instructions

http://imgur.com/a/tdOi3#1 The bag feels cleap and nasty, but easily fits the torch. On the back it has the standard belt strap (plus the removal strap that attaches via push stud - http://imgur.com/a/tdOi3#15 )

http://imgur.com/a/tdOi3#3 The light itself is heavy, but compact. It holdes well in the hand, and has a side switch which makes it easier to turn on and off. The switch also flashes every few seconds, so if you wake up during the night, you can find it.

http://imgur.com/a/tdOi3#9 It looks a bit strange, but the rear circuit board freely rotates, and the two pins that stick out line up to corrosponding holes on the body. http://imgur.com/a/tdOi3#12 It's a good fit, and i believe them when they say it's waterproof.

Positives:

* It's bright, very bright. When i hear a noise outside, i shine it down the street and i feel like a prison officer with a flood light. 
* The strap on it feels really good, and the width of the body is nice. 

Negatives

* The UI is difficult to understand, and it took a bit of practice to learn how to use the thing. It has half press and full press, but still difficult to use. It's so difficult, users on BLF have created a [cheat sheet](http://budgetlightforum.com/node/17442).  [Direct Link](https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=330e3650cf591eba&amp;id=330E3650CF591EBA!141&amp;sff=1&amp;authkey=!AHbbHVK9hl7mKGg)
* It rapes batteries

Would i get it again? Yeah, it's quite good.

I've been searching for some time for a suitable alternative to the headlamps I use for running my airboat at night. The light that I use, and the one most commonly used by airboaters here in FL, are 100 watt tungsten halogen headlamps that run off 12 volts supplied by the boats electrical system. These lights are very bright at about 3000 lumen. The drawbacks are that they get really hot, draw a lot of power, and are very fragile. The fragile nature of these lights requires me to carry a backup bulb which is difficult to change. 


Here's an example of what we currently use: [link](http://www.huntinglight.com/superspot-watt-p-28.html)


My search online led me to some specialty lights for cavers that meet the brightness and ruggedness requirements; however, these lights are very expensive at 800$-1200$. Also these lights are not directly compatible with the 12v system in a boat (it would be nice to be able to use either a battery pack or 12v power from the boat).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

**Purpose:** EDC. The IR is so I can look through my phone camera for nightvision for finding animals by the reflection of their eyes without spooking them and a few other things. The UV is because I tag all of my EDC with fluorescent and if I lose something I can wait until dark to find it, or I can mark a trail with clear dots of glow in the dark nail polish and then see the dots without having to readjust my eyes to the dark. 

**Size:** 3XAAA side-by-side carriage width (not sure what those are called or how many millimeters width they typically are)

**Battery type &amp; quantity:** 3XAAA

**Price Range:** no idea, somewhere at the crossroads of quality and cheap

**Lumens:** I'm hoping to be able to get 200-300 but I'm not sure if that is possible with 3xAAA

**Switch Type:** I haven't decided for sure, but tailcap button is what I am accustomed to. I prefer the tailcap style where you can push it down a little to turn it on temporarily.

Any build suggestions would be welcome. I need the white and IR emitters to be bright but the UV doesn't need to be very bright and I might just skip UV and buy some tiny cheap keychain UV light if I can find a really small one. My EDC kit is already ridiculous so adding a second light to it doesn't seem like a good idea.

At this point I am having trouble figuring out which type of emitters to use. Maybe I'm better off getting a 3 LED board with a switch. I'd want to install a tiny 3 mode switch for the side so the tailcap could still do its job.

I would use the ""Before You Buy Help"" format (which I loved so much I cannibalized it for /r/knives ) but I don't care about anything else other than; Do flashlights like this exist in any form or price range?

Also, if anyone knows of tiny keychain lights that emit UV I would like some recommendations for those too.

It looks like the max output with a AAA is 75 lumens, but it can double or triple that with an unprotected 10440.  About that...

So, I'm a full time bar man.  One potential (rare, but necessary) use is to flash someone in the eyes to buy myself a half second, like a self defense tool.  Is 75 lumens enough for that, or would I need the 10440? (Where is the line between momentary blindness and permanent damage?  I'm not out to hurt anyone.)  Also, there are warnings all over em-mgt about these batteries, and since I often have this thing in my mouth to keep my hands free, I am interested in your honest assessment of the safety considerations. 

The Eiger ultra claims to triple the throw, so does that mean a more intense brightness?  Could I just use that, rather than the 10440 battery?

Also, one reviewer points out that em-mgt sells a pocket clip (important for me) but it's for a larger light and he had to grind it down.  I can't find any clips at all, as that site gives me headaches.  Any suggestions?

Lastly, if I'm spending this much, I expect this thing to last forever.  I like the look of the aluminum, but have concerns about the threads being too brittle and breaking.  Has anyone had that problem?  Should I just go for the steel or brass?

I know it's a bit rushed, but i literally just got off the plane. beamshots tomorrow.

It arrived in a [sketchy yellow envelope](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#0), pretty much what every standard ebay package from china looks like..

Inside is a very [compact little box](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#1), which opens out with the [instructions sitting ontop](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#2). The flashlight is sitting there in the middle, and the [headband](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#8) is behind it. 

The flashlight is [very small](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#10), fits one AA battery [straight in](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#20). It's got some lubricant on the [threads](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#19), so that's good they've considered that. 

The light is [fucking bright](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#22), like BF3 pre-patch bright. You can't look at the bulb when it's on full. The cool thing is around the bulb, the area has been painted in luminescent paint. So when you turn the light off, the [surrounding area glows](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#27), kind of reminds me of a [jet engine](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#28). Looks fucking badass.

The [little pocket clip](http://imgur.com/a/VIAS9#33) comes off with some force, the chrome looks a bit cheap.

The headstrap looks a little flimsy, but i'll test it later. Same with beamshots, i'll do them tomorrow night.

I received a 2xAAA Mini Maglite as a gift that I would like to use (it has a company logo laser-engraved on it), however, I'm less than impressed with the incandescent light bulb that it comes with.

Could anyone recommend a replacement LED module?  I would prefer a drop-in.  Also, any suggestions for a borosilicate glass lens would be welcome as well.

Thank you.l

- XM-L CW 

- Clicky 

- 3 main modes - L/M/H

**Differences/Preferences**

- Zebralight is shorter and a bit thicker overall. 

- Zebralight won't fit in the pocket as well because of the ridge grip and uneven head/body shape. The Xeno has an even cylindrical body, which I prefer.

- I prefer the click-through UI of the Xeno over the click-hold UI of the Zebralight.

- Output/efficiency on Lithium primaries is better on Zebralight

- Build quality is adequately good on both.

Does anybody know the lumen output on alkalines or lithium primaries for the Xeno E03. I know the listed lumens(20/45/130) is wrong according to reviewers. I can't seem to find this anywhere.

I am looking for a flashlight that I can use for all purposes, from going camping to running in the morning to walking to my car at night. I tend to stay on campus until dark and the walk to my car is a long one in the city. In addition, I run at 4:00 in the morning and would like the option to have a defensive flashlight should the need arise.    
    
    
There were a few that I was looking at, including the Fenix TK15/22, FourSevens Maelstrom, Surefire E2D Defender, and the Klarus XT11. Unless the Surefire has raving reviews by you guys, I will probably disregard it due to cost and limited outputs (only max and very low).   
   
If anyone can testify for one of these or suggest an alternative, I would be grateful.    
    
I addition, I notice that many of these lights have an ""Impact Resistance"" of around 1-1.5m. Does this mean that the light can withstand a fall from 1-1.5 meters without breaking, and any higher than that would cause it to break? This seems like a bad quality in a flashlight designed with a strike bezel. Please clarify for me.

I've EDC'd a first-generation [Inova X5](http://www.uvprocess.com/products%5CCURING%20CONTROLS.D7.UV%20INSPECTION%20EQUIPMENT%20AND%20MATERIALS.UVINSP%5CINOVA%20X5.UVINSP%20%20%20R%5CUVINSP%20%20%20R_MVC00011a-WHITE_WebPic1.jpg) (2xCR123a, 5-LED, ~20-30 lumens I think) for a great many years, during which time it has served me very well.  However at a recent tactics class, my flashlight was by far the weakest of the whole group.  This was, of course, totally humiliating.  It's time for an upgrade.

What I love about the X5- [it goes in its belt holster tail-up](http://flashlightsunlimited.com/images/Inova/SeriesXHolsters.jpg), so I can easily grab it with either hand already in 'ready to use' position.  I want a flashlight without an enlarged head or aggressive anti-roll pattern, so I can holster the new light in the same way (lens down).  I also want an open-top holster, so it can be drawn and reholstered with one hand.

General other requirements- a bright-as-fuck LED light in approximately the same size (4.75"" x 0.865""), with 1xAA, 2xAA or 2xCR123a/1x18650 power.  Should have multiple modes with memory, at least 3 brightness levels (one of which is in the ~50 lumen range), and a forward-clicky or similar type tailswitch.  I'd like peak output of at least 300-400 lumens.  Natural light is preferred.  Extra modes like strobe or SOS are a plus but not required.  Stand-on-end (candle mode) and scalloped (tactical-style) bezel also a plus.  I want something that will last another 10 years, so I don't mind paying $60-$80 or more if it's near-indestructible.  

Here's the chart:

Stat|Requirement
----------------------------:|:------------------------
Battery Type and Quantity | 1xAA, 2xAA, or 2xCR123a/1x18650
Price | Willing to pay for quality, I'm thinking $80ish but I'm open to higher if it's what I need
Style | Handheld flashlight, no lens bulge, no aggressive anti-roll, open-top belt holster which can hold the light lens-down
Size | Approx 4.75"" x 0.860""
Activation Mechanism | Forward clicky or similar, should have memory to keep it in a ~50 lumen mode
Beam Type | Medium-ish Throw
LED type | Whatever, natural color preferred, at least 300-400 lumen peak output


I did some research of my own- the [Fenix E35](http://www.fenixtactical.com/fenix-e35.html) is perfect size wise but doesn't come with a holster (and my Inova holster is getting old) so I'd have to find an aftermarket holster.  [Fenix LD12](http://www.fenixtactical.com/fenix-ld12.html) is also perfect size but gets trounced on high end output due to 1xAA power (although AA power makes it easy to refuel).   [Fenix PD32 UE](http://www.amazon.com/Fenix-PD32-rechargeable-intelligent-EdisonBright/dp/B00ANUKP7A/) looks really tempting, but it's big.  [EagleTac D24LC2](http://www.eagletac.com/html/d25lc2rc/specs.html) is another possibility but again will need an aftermarket holster as the included one has a flap.  [Nitecore's MT-2C](http://www.nitecore.com/productDetail.aspx?id=49) is their closest contender, although the anti-roll nut does stick out a bit.  

If there is a specific recommendation for or against one of the above, or another model I should be considering, I would be most grateful!

Too much will ruin everyone's night vision and scare fish, and too little doesn't project enough light onto the deck to see things (so no aspherics please!).

I would love it to be an XML2, but it's not such a big matter.

Right now, I've a modified TN31 (XML2) coming in which runs at 5.6A, has 1300 lumens and 350kcd (and 1200m throw vs SR95S UT 250kcd and 1000m throw). 

This is really the ideal light for fishing, and I want to get something similar to this, but want a little variation.

I am a college student who moonlights as a pizza deliverer and valet guy (though I like to tell people I'm a professional driver). I've got most of my EDC set except for a flashlight. I like to shop around a bit before making a purchase, particularly because my budget is tight and I like owning things that will last. It was easy for me to pour over loads of data before selecting my 1994 Old Timer OT-34 Middleman knife, but for some reason I just can't get into spending all that time to become an expert on flashlights. So here I am, humbly submitting to your expertise. I'll mostly be using the light during my jobs, and there's a good chance it'll get stored in the car sometimes. I do know that I would like something that fits into my pocket, even if it is somewhat bulky. Also, AA or AAA batteries are ideal. Beyond that, I'll let Secateur's checklist from [CandlePowerForums](http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php?276972-Flashlight-Recommendation-Checklist-Updated!!) tell the rest of the story. Thanks in advance for your help! It is most appreciated!

____I would like to purchase the light from a brick and mortar store. I am located in ______________.


__X_I will be mail-ordering or buying online, so this doesn't matter.


2) Budget: An easy question, but you may change your mind after answering the rest! :-)

_X__Less than $25.

_ X __Less than $50. 

____Less than $100.

____I want a lantern.

____I want a dive light.

____I want a portable spotlight.



4) Flashlight-specific format/size:

_ X __Keychain size.

_ X __Every day carry small (2-4 inches).

____I don't know.



6) Manufacturer:

_ X __I want to buy a light from a traditional mass producing manufacturer that is ready to go out of the box.

_ X __I would consider getting a light that is pieced together (for example a “host” or flashlight body from one manufacturer, and a “drop-in” emitter from another source). Under the right circumstances, this path can provide more options to the consumer to meet specific needs, and can often be easily upgradeable as technology improves.



7) What battery type do you want to use?

_ X __I intend to use alkaline batteries (AAA, AA, C, D) (disclaimer, while it does not preclude all choices, these are not recommended for many of today’s most powerful lights)

____I intend to use rechargeable nickel chemistry (NiCad, NiMH, NiZn)

____I intend to use lithium primary batteries (CR123, CR2, Energizer Advanced/Ultimate Lithium AA/AAA)

____I intend to use rechargeable lithium (li-ion) chemistry. Feel free to specify a size if you know which size you want (14500, RCR123/16340, 17500, 17670, 18650, etc.)

____I want a light with an integrated rechargeable battery. (Note: these choices may be very limited unless you are looking at spotlights)



8) How much genuine out the front (OTF) light do you want/need? Sometimes you can have too much light (trying to read up close up with a 100 lumen light is impossible). 

____I want to navigate a dark room or read a map (0-10 lumens).

_ X __I want to walk around an unlit rural area (50-150 lumens).  I want to be able to spot house numbers from my car on the curb.

____I want to illuminate my entire backyard or a campsite (150-300 lumens).

____I want to illuminate an entire field, the neighbor's front yard several houses down, impress my friends and neighbors, etc. (300-700 lumens).

____I want ridiculous amounts of lumens (800+ lumens).



9) Throw vs. Flood: At what distance will you be most likely to use this light? Select all that apply.

_ X __Less than 1 yard/meter (reading, other close work)

_ X __Less than 5 yards/meters (looking for something inside a dark shed/garage/basement)

_ X __5-20 yards/meters (check out a noise in the backyard)

____30-50 yards/meters (I have a big backyard)

____50-150 yards/meters (I live in a very rural area/farm with wide open spaces)

____150+ yards (I want maximum throw possible)



10) Runtime: Not over-inflated manufacturer runtime claims, but usable brightness measured from first activation to 50% with new batteries (Measured on maximum output).

____Up to 30 minutes (I want the brightest [and potentially smallest] light for brief periods) 

_ X __30-60 minutes (I have plenty of batteries just ready to be changed)

_ X __90-120 minutes (Runtime is moderately important, but still not critical)

____3 hours + (I critically need this light to run on max for extended periods in between battery changes/charges).



11) Durability/Usage: Generally the old phrase “you get what you pay for” is very accurate for flashlights. 

____Not Important (A “night-stand” light).

_ X __Slightly Important (Walks around the neighborhood).

_ X __Very Important (Camping, Backpacking, Car Glove-box).

____Critical (Police, Fire, Search &amp; Rescue, Caving, Survival).

____I don't care.

____I don’t know.



12) Switch Type and location (choose all that apply): 

_ X __I want a forward clicky (Helpful for momentary activation and signaling).

____I want a reverse clicky (For use with multi-mode/level lights).

____I want a momentary switch (Predominantly for use with signaling and short bursts of momentary light only).

____I want a twisty switch (Tighten the head/tailcap to activate, and the light will stay on until the head/tailcap is loosened).

____I want a body mounted switch (near the head, like on a Maglite).

_ X __I want a tail mounted switch (found on the majority of today’s high end lights).

____I don't care.

____I don’t know.

____Other, please specify____________________.


I could deal with several different setups in this area. Straight up on-off works just fine for me but isn't required, and a tail mounted switch is preferred, but again not required.


13) User Interface (UI) and mode selection. Select all that apply. 

_ X __A simple on-off with only one output level is fine for me.

____I want 2 light levels. (Brighter/short runtime and Dimmer/long runtime.) 

____I want multiple light levels. (Some lights have 5-16 light levels.) 

____I want a programmable light.

____I want a selector ring.

____I want a strobe mode. (Blinks to show location.)

____I want SOS mode.

____I want a beacon mode.

_ X __I don’t care.

____I don’t know.



14)Material/Finish/Coating

____Plastic/composite body (this may limit your choices significantly).

____Anodized Aluminum – either type II or III (Hard Anodized) (Aluminum, specifically HA, is the most common material/finish for today’s flashlights).

____Stainless steel (durable, but much heavier than aluminum)

____Titanium (durable and nearly as lightweight as aluminum, but can be moderately to significantly more expensive).

_ X __I don’t care.

____I don’t know.

____Other, please specify____________.



15) Special Needs/extras: Is there anything else you want or need that hasn't been mentioned? Select any below.

____Red filter (for preserving night vision).

____Other filter colors (Amber, Green, Blue, _________).

____Dedicated R/G/B secondary LEDs.

____“Hybrid” light (bright incandescent combined with long running LEDs)

____Pocket/belt clip

____Holster

____Wrist/Neck Lanyard

____Crenulated bezel

____Non-sparking Intrinsically Safe (IS) for use in explosive environments

Drop-in: Solarforce single mode XPG (3v-18v)

Powered by: 2x CR123

Mount: It sits in an Elzetta mount on a 12 Gauge Remington 870

Issue: After a trip to the range this week, the light fails to function. No light, no flickering, nothing. 

This was the first time live firing with the light mounted. The light was functioning perfectly when checked immediately prior to the range trip. I fired about 50 rounds of 00 Buck, and about 10 slugs.  When I came home and function checked both light and firearm, I noticed that the light had failed.  

Troubleshooting:  
First, I checked the batteries. They functioned fine in another light, and new batteries didn't work in the L2P.

Second, I checked the tailcap switch. With the tail cap off, I used a key to short the negative terminal to the housing. No joy. I then checked the tail cap itself for resistance with a multimeter. With the switch on, resistance was near zero, with the switch off, it wouldn't register. I'm no engineer, but I don't think the tail cap is the problem.

I also checked all the contacts and springs, they are clean, and as best I can tell, properly in place. 

So, I'm fairly certain the drop-in is shot. What method can I use to check the drop-in with a multimeter to confirm this, and what else should I be looking for? Should I just check the leads for resistance, or is there something else I should try?  

If it is the drop-in, is there an easy way of repairing it? I imagine its not worth the effort. It might just be time for me to upgrade to a Malkoff... 

Thanks in advance.

Your knowledge will be very valuable for me.    
  
**Purpose** A convenient way of keeping a light source at all times. I would be looking at things very close by, though occasionally might need to scan 10 or meters ahead.    
  
**Size** Ideally less than 10cm/4"" in length. 
  
**Battery Type &amp; Quantity**  1 AA or AAA battery would be enough.  
  
**Price Range** $150 or under. Hopefully, a lot less!
  
**Type** Handheld, LED flashlight
  
**Lumens** Capable of over 120 lumens. (This should be easy, right?) Also able to provide about 1 lumen, for long life usage.   
  
**Switch Type** Any is OK. I guess pressing something would be easiest. I would like at least two settings:low power &amp; full power. A third setting, blink, to save power over a long duration would be a small plus.  
  
**Anything Else** It should be rugged. Also, if it can tolerate being immersed in water, that would be a definite plus. If there were an extension to put over the LED to magnify the power of the light, that would be a good plus.  
    
The best 2 options I have seen so far are below. I hope you can suggest something better. I don't know the features to look for, e.g. the latest type of LED and the spec for water safeness.  
  
[Maratac™ AAA Flashlight Rev 2](http://countycomm.com/aaa.html)

[Lumapower EDC LM21](http://www.lumapower.com/Online%20Web/contents/en-us/p39_EDC_LM21.html)

Going from 140 to 400 is more than double the lumens, but I can't see more than double the stuff. I can't really make anything else out at 400 lumens that I could not at 140. 

Going for the full 740 lumens is really a ""hey, check this out"" sort of thing. It's even less of a return going from 400 lumens to 740. It's not double, which is approximately the lumen difference.

I figured I would share it here as well.  The original can be found [here](http://udanis.com/maglite-solitaire-led-review/) with images and a comparison table with the non-led version.  (Some of the links on my website are amazon affilate - just making you aware of that)


Recently I have been looking for a good flashlight to add to my key-chain. A lot of people online recommend the Streamlight Nano Light , but due to it requiring coin cell batteries I decided to look for another option that uses standard batteries. In my searching I came upon the MAGLITE Solitaire  and the Maglite Solitaire Led. I have always have been happy with maglite products so I decided to give the brighter Maglite Solitaire Led. I ordered it offline and a few days later it arrived.

Construction:
This Maglite Solitaire LED is comprised of 3 assemblies machined out of 6061 anodized aluminum.
Tail Cap Assembly: The tail-cap of the Solitaire LED is the same as the standard Non-LED version of this Maglite. The tail-cap is composed of 3 pieces and a gasket. There is the aluminium tail cap, battery spring, and electrical contact.
Main Body Assembly: The main body is comprised of the led, led bost driver, aluminium housing and switch. Unlike the non-LED version, the LED Solitaire has a serial number laser etched onto it. The serial number is two letters then 8 numbers. The main body is designed to be repaired/replace as a single unit and it is not design to be user repaired or taken apart.
Head Assembly: The head is comprised of the reflector, aluminium holder, lens, and one seal/Gasket. The like the main body, the head is designed to be repaired/replace as a single unit and it is not design to be user repaired or taken apart. The head of the led version of the Solitaire is different than the non-LED version, the reflector is shaped differently and LED is laser etched into the head as well.


Both lights are identical when it comes to size and shape. The only difference is what is inside. The Maglite Solitaire LED is substantially brighter than the non-LED version. In fact the Solitaire LED is even brighter than the substantially larger Mini Maglite 2-AA Flashlight. For being a small flashlight that can easily be put on a keychain, this light is incredibly bright and is definitely a useable light! If you are looking for a keychain sized flashlight I would fully recommend the Maglite Solitaire LED.

One other difference to note between the led and the incandescent version is the warmth of the colors.  The incandecent version is somewhere in the area of 3000k and the led version is closer to 4500k.

I need some suggestions for a solid pocket/keychain flashlight.  I would prefer that it:

Takes 1 AAA

Has a clicky tail-button 

Has only on-off function (no turbo, SOS, strobe, mega-turbo-SOS mode)


I checked the subreddit's FAQ on AAA lights, but many of the clicky options looked cheap, and made by by no name brands.  I have a Streamlight Microstream, but recently tanked and I'm wondering if there isn't a better option.

Unfortunately, I dislike twist switches, so this limits my selection quite a bit. Fortunately there are still clicky lights, and here is a short review of the three I own.

**LED Lenser P3 AFS P**

Pros: Brightest of the three, best color of the three as well, focusable beam (something many LED lights lack), clip has a flat spot on the body underneath - makes clipping it easier.

Cons: The beam focus mechanism (sliding the head back and forth) is way way too loose - it just flops around. Clip was nearly impossible to put on - I had to use pliers to widen them a bit. Worst of all: The switch is insanely easy to turn on - I ran many batteries nearly dead while it was on in my pocket.

Rating: 3/5

**Streamlight Microsteam**

Pros: It pushes light out the front.

Cons: Dimmest of the three, worst color, the clip scraches the body unless you pry it out, the switch is nearly impossible to depress with just your thumb - my thumb pops unless my hand is at just the right angle, very little bezel - the lens was scratched after just two carries.

Rating: 1/5

**Pelican 1910**

Pros: Very solid construction, button is just right as far as resistance goes, good light and color, only clip so far to be screwed on with the cap.

Cons: Similar short bezel but not scratched so far, clip is a little hard to attach to my pocket though I could probably just bend it out.

Rating: 5/5, highly recommended

Note: None of these had intensity control, but for a 1xAAA, I'm happy with max brightness. Also, most of these were pretty inexpensive.

UniqueFire F12-B

I am leaning towards the Uniquefire at the moment because it’s the only one I could find reviews for and the reviews I found were very positive. Also it has a U2 emitter. My concern though is it might not be that bright and that it doesn’t take 18650’s (although I prefer cr123’s so not that big a deal).

The small sun looks nice and is cheap but doesn’t specifically say it can take cr123’s, although the input voltage looks right.

The smiling shark looks nice, has a good price and can take multiple battery configurations, but does not have a u2 and has no reviews. It also looks like it may be able to charge batteries which is interesting. I like the side switch as well.

Any thoughts? 

As you can probably tell, my budget is rather lower. I'd say up to 30 bucks.

In short I'm flabberghasted at what Trustfire has pulled off in terms of quality and finishing. This review made me start to take chinese budget lights seriously!

Full disclosure: This light was sent to me for free by Aurabuy.com who in return asked for an unbiased review. Aside from getting to keep the light, there's no compensation of any kind.

This review is structured with inline images, I suggest you use Reddit Enhancement Suite (if you aren't already) to easily view the images.

Now that that's out of the way:

**Overall Rating:** ★★★★★

* Battery: 1x18650 (fits protected cell)	 
* Switch: Side (reverse clicky) 
* Modes: High, Medium, Low, Strobe, SOS	 
* LED Type:	 CREE XP-G R5
* Lens: glass lens, singlecoated at best
* Tailstands: Yes, but slightly unstable with strap	 
* Price Paid:	 $24.35
* From:	http://www.aurabuy.com/trustfire-t2-cree-xp-g-r5-380lm-5-mode-memory-white-led-flashlight-torch-w-strap-1-18650.html
* Date Ordered:	March 15, 2013 
 

***Pros:***

* Unique design
* Tailstands
* Rugged
* High output
* Tripod mount
* Nicely finished
* Comfortable to hold (at least for big hands)
* Flood mode when you remove the reflector and lens
 
***Cons:***

* ""Tactical"" strobe and SOS modes
* Tailstand is slightly wobbly with strap attached
* Somewhat noticeable PWM on lowest mode
* Doesn't fit bottomless flashlight holsters
* No fancy box - less suitable as a gift

***Features / Value:*** ★★★★☆

Well, it's your standard XP-G R5 light. It has the common 5 mode memory which cycles between High - Medium - Low - Strobe and SOS. I personally don't care about the last two modes, I work as a lighting engineer on rock shows and the strobe modes are more of an annoyance than a feature. Still, the strobe is sufficiently timed to be VERY desorienting to any would-be attackers, and the SOS mode is signed correctly, unlike some other chinese lights which sign ""OSO"". 
There's a 1/4"" tripod mount on the bottom, and you can unscrew the lens and reflector housing to create a flood light, similar to the way Maglites work.


 

***Design / Build Quality:*** ★★★★★

http://i.imgur.com/aNiu9s6.jpg

http://i.imgur.com/SHQV0G9.jpg

First impression when you pick this light up: wow, this is one rugged light!. You would think the rectangular shape would be uncomfortable to hold but nothing is less true. If you have large hands like me, this flashlight is a joy to hold. 
The rectangular area fits perfectly and the rounded transition provides a lot of lateral grip, along with the small crenellations in the body.
The front features a slightly crennelated bezel which is not too intimidating, and a smooth reflector. Note that the ribs you see in this picture are slight optical abberations from my fingerprint on the glass lens. Oops.

http://i.imgur.com/JVcv8Gc.jpg

I love the chromed top and bottom which, from the images you might think are flimsy. They're not, it's extremely solid and thick steel as you can see on the back of the light.

http://i.imgur.com/KwqFaq7.jpg

This shot also shows the standard 1/4"" tripod mount which makes it possible to mount the flashlight to any standard tripod or photo accessory. Here's the light on my flexible tripod to give you an idea.

http://i.imgur.com/OetTQ9o.jpg

The side switch is nicely positioned and feels very sturdy. It's a reverse clicky which makes switching through the modes when the flashlight is turned on a breeze, and the rubber cover fits very snugly.

Then there's the anodizing quality, which is pretty good. The color itself is something between matte black and grey, anthracite seems to best describe it. The printing on the anodizing is rather high quality, as you can see in my 100% enlargement:

http://i.imgur.com/j9lCSGd.jpg

But enough about the outside, let's take it apart!

http://i.imgur.com/3x067KK.jpg

When taking the light apart the first thing you notice is the long threads, especially on the back. This gives the light a very sturdy feel, but also makes changing the battery a slightly slower process. The threads themselves are properly lubed, and sealed with a glow-in-the-dark O-rings.

http://i.imgur.com/28x1QIR.jpg

On the front you'll find that the driver and LED board are integrated into the body which I see as a benefit, as it makes it less likely for the driver to become loose and shortcircuit under stress or after an impact. However, there are two small holes available which should allow you to release the driver for some modding.

http://i.imgur.com/sE7yvNi.jpg

All in all I'm very impressed by all these things, in terms of design and features this light offers a tremendous value and can be compared to much more expensive lights. The light is advertised as water resistant and I have absolutely no reason to doubt that.

***Battery Life:*** ★★★★☆

Well, it's an XP-G R5 running at a digitally regulated 1200mA and according to CREE the module has an efficiency of ~93 lumens/watt (at 1500mA) which is pretty good.
I know an XM-L is more efficient than an XP-G, but I think the added throw and the bonus in reflector design is worth the slightly lowered efficiency.
As far as battery life itself goes, in the two weeks that extensively I've used the light (6 nights a week including one power outage) I've not managed to drain a single 2400 mah cell.
Manufacturer rated this light should do 3-5 hours depending on the power mode and I'm inclined to agree on for the low power mode, but high will probably only do 2-2.5 hours at best.

 

***Light Output:*** ★★★★☆

Well what do you know, the light is advertised as 380 lumens and actually manages to surpass that, being at least 400 lumens when running on high for a while! 
The beam itself has enough spill to be a multipurpose light, but when you need throw there's a very tight hotspot exactly where you want it. I dug out a smoke machine, filled a room with smoke (much to my colleagues annoyance) and took a shot of the beam itself:

http://i.imgur.com/88obnRO.jpg

Neat! The beam pattern itself is also very nice, it's not ringy in any way as my XM-L lights are, this one is just a neat ring of flood, with a very bright even hotspot. I'm pleased to say no chromatic abberation (fringing) to be seen on the edges.

High:
http://i.imgur.com/Cni6dFg.jpg

Medium:
http://i.imgur.com/p5IV2W6.jpg

Low:
http://i.imgur.com/WKKRx6e.jpg

As an added bonus you can also choose to unscrew the head which turns the light into a candle/flood. Nice for camping, or for those moments where you need a wide flood light:

http://i.imgur.com/DkHl0Sc.jpg

There is some visible PWM going on at the low mode which is visible when you're moving quickly and have the reflector unscrewed. With the reflector the effect is much less obvious. I haven't noticed it on the medium mode though.

I measured the color temperature to be 5500 Kelvin which is pretty much neutral daylight/camera flash.
 

***Summary:*** ★★★★★

All in all I can heartily recommend this light. The free shipping was relatively fast and the light was packed very well in boxes and multiple layers of bubble wrappings. The light itself looks like it cost 3 times as much and brings some nice features to the table which you don't see on other lights. 
and let's not forget the build quality. Things tend to break in my line of work so often that I have a 300$ Peli case to keep my stuff in. And guess what, I've used this light for two weeks and it still looks like new aside from one or two tiny scratches in the anodizing.
There's one of two flaws that would have gotten it a 4/5 star rating, but then I considered this light only costs ~25 dollars.

Edit: Thanks to Arg- and fridgetarian for info that duracoat will go nicely on the anodization. 

SECOND QUESTION NOW: would it need to be disassembled before coated? And would that be difficult/dangerous to the flashlight? I'll be looking into that on my own but someone could reply faster than I can google.

For people who might care find this post later, I emailed zebralight and they said "" There is no way to remove the internals without damaging the light. There is only one circuit board in the SC52. The board is held with screws, soldered and potted with thermal conductive epoxy. Press-fit bezel is hard to remove (without damaging the lens) to begin with.""

Being able to tail-stand, having a few modes.  Long run-time is also a plus.  If I'm getting picky I'd also like lots of knurling and one that won't roll.

Help me find a new EDC light that's cheap that I won't cry about if I lose?,Lazek,10,3,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/18u12y/i_lost_my_quantum_dd_help_me_find_a_new_edc_light/,"The Quantum DD is probably the best EDC light out there. Stainless steel body, infinitely variable brightness, maximum 100 lumen output, and small, half the length of your pinky finger. But it's disappeared from my keyring, which is odd - it was on its own split ring on a coated mechanic's cable, so to disappear it would have had to break off the split ring somehow. If the mechanic's cable had come undone, I would have had a pocketful of loose keys, so I know that didn't happen.

Anyway, that light wasn't cheap (it wasn't ultra expensive, either, but still too expensive to be something that could easily disappear like that without me noticing). I've ordered another one, because I love that thing, but I'm probably going to only carry it on special occasions. Now I'm looking into possibly getting a cheap AAA battery flashlight instead.

So, can you guys help me find a good replacement EDC light?


•Purpose: EDC. I don't have any illusions about blinding an attacker or anything, I just want a couple modes. I don't need strobe though.

 •Size: Small. Obviously it won't be as small as the Quantum DD, but shorter than a Fenix E11 for sure. I had the Quantum on my keyring before, but the lanyard hole wasn't big enough to put on my mechanic's cable and so I had to use a split ring. I feel like this point of weakness definitely contributed to losing the light. So something bigger with a pocket clip would be best.

 •Battery Type &amp; Quantity: One cell, please. Since I want something shorter than the Fenix E11, I'd say one AAA or CR123. AA is okay, as long as the body is not very long.

 •Price Range: Here's the sticking point. I don't want to shell out another 50-60 bucks for an EDC light that I may lose. So I'm trying to keep it under 30 bucks. If your recommendations are even cheaper than that, I might buy a few lights and try them all out.

 •Type: Single cell handheld.

 •Lumens: A good low would be nice, like just a couple lumens. Max, maybe about 100, but more the merrier. As long as it has a couple modes though, I think I'll be good.

 •Switch type: I prefer a clicky, but twists are okay too.

Suggestions?


**Purpose:** Illuminating attic space, the back of cabinets, and inside walls.

I'd prefer to find a single unit to do both, but if that's not reasonable, I'll get two.

 **Size:** Medium length, and light. The Fenix PD32 caught my eye, aesthetically, but I haven't held one to get a sense for weight. Keep in mind that I will often have it clipped on my belt or pocket, so a secure clip is almost a must.

**Battery type &amp; quantity:** No preference

**Price Range:** I'm willing to pay for better quality, even if I don't ""need"" it for my current application. I'd like to keep it under $300. 

**Lumens:** Don't know. The more, the better?

* I am wanting something small enough to throw into my bag or even in my pocket, if needed, but with enough power to provide good light.

* I want to stay around the $50-75 range as well.

* I would like to make sure they are waterproof to be safe.

* I like the ability to get a converter to use AAA batteries, in case they were all that was available.

I have a couple questions still, though. 

* Those with personal experience with the 4Sevens - Do you prefer the tactical or pro interface? I'm not sure which would be better for normal use.

* How much use would the ""moonlight mode"" see through normal events? It seems almost too low to be effective for anything beyond reading a book or map at night.

* Would there be a better light suited for my needs?

My experience with higher quality flashlights has been the Olight M30 Triton, my main around the house light, which I love; a Surefire G3 LED, which is mounted on my AR-15; a Surefire 6PX Tactical that I gave my mom as a present; and an older model Leatherman Monarch 500, my current toolbox light.

Preferred Size would be in the 5 to 7 inches length, with main head diameter of no more than 1.5 inches. This light needs to go into tight spaces, so it can't be too big. LED a must, with neutral color preferred. Batteries can be AAA, AA, or 123's, it can also be rechargable if it comes with a dock/base. I'm looking somewhere between 50 and 150 dollars, higher if it's a really good light.

Now, the problem is that I need a light that is bright but not too bright, and that floods but still has a large hotspot. The reason why it can't be too bright because in dark places it would take too long for eyes to adjust when turning on and off. The medium setting on my M30 Triton would be the right amount of light, or the output of the G3 LED, but can be brighter. But both lights have a hot spot that is too small. So if I want a bigger center spot, that will increase the lumen requirement too for a given spot  to have the same brightness, correct?
Maybe something in the 100 - 200 lumen range?

Battery life is also important. This light will be in heavy use, on and off for an 8 hour shift. If I can stick to changing batteries once or twice a week, or recharge it every night, that would be great.

Switch type must be a click on-off, either side or tail, with tail preferred. Multiple output levels can be a plus, but not required. I've been looking at Streamlight, Olight, Surefire, and Fenix, but it's hard to find places to shop for flashlights here in Anchorage, AK.

I know it's more of a thrower, but I figure I can diffuse the light if needed with some makeshift plastic cover.

1347864716.0,6,self.flashlight,100gcx,Looking for a flashlight to carry in the car for delivery,DerMann,7,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/100gcx/looking_for_a_flashlight_to_carry_in_the_car_for/,"- Purpose:  I need a decent flashlight to carry in my car, I deliver pizza and, especially in super-rich mini-mansion type neighborhoods, house numbers are very poorly illuminated.

- Size: Size isn't really a problem.  I drive an American full size sedan (Grand Marquis).  I was fine carrying a 3-cell maglite for a while.  I'd prefer something larger, so as to keep it from disappearing in my car when I have a lot of stuff in there.  I really like the size and shape of the 3-cell maglite.

- Battery type &amp; quantity: I'd rather pay a bit more for batteries and have them last or be able to recharge them than constantly having to feed the torch cheap AAs.  At the same time, I'd like to retain a common type in case I'd need to pick some up on the road without having to recharge them at home.

- Price Range: I'm looking to spend about $50, but I'll consider anything under $90

- Lumens: I'm not looking for a spotlight or quasi-laser.  I just want something that will effectively illuminate a house's number plaque from the street (say 10-20 meters).  I don't want something that's too bright and causes reflective metal numbers to flare up or disturb people.

- Switch Type: I despise the twist on switches that mini-maglites use.  Those plastic, angular military surplus flashlights have the best switches I've ever used.  Basically a regular switch with an interrupter button that lets you flash it quickly off and on.  I do like standard maglite switches.

- Anything else:  As you may have guessed, I really like maglites.  I may just have had bad luck with them, but the past three I've bought over the years didn't last very long.  I also really like those plastic, angular mil-surp lights.  I bought one around 2001, and apart from losing the colored lenses, the thing still works.  The only thing is, the bulb on mine has never been very bright (tried the replacement one in the battery compartment too), and the plastic lens is horridly scratched as well.  I'm also not able to adjust the diameter and focus of the beam as much as I'd like to be able to.",,False,self,t5_2qjmy,False,,,True,t3_100gcx,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/100gcx/looking_for_a_flashlight_to_carry_in_the_car_for/,

 Purpose: general use/camping, maybe EDC if size permits. Something with a good throw.

 Size: something I can carry in my pocket easily, but more substantial than a penlight. 

 Battery type &amp; quantity: 2xAA

 Price Range:$50-90

 Lumens: my only experience is with crappy walmart flashlights, I have no idea. 

 Switch Type: most of the variation between my options deals with this, also little experience, but I want something with quick access to at least a high and low mode.

 

The lights I've been looking at so far are the 4sevens Quark series and the Fenix LD20/LD22.

Both of these brands look like they will get the job done, so the deciding factor will probably be UI, I ruled out the ""tactical"" quark series because while i like being able to program 2 modes into my flashlight, only having quick access to those 2 modes is a deal breaker.

Does anybody have first hand experience with either of these lights, and are there any other similar options in this price range that I've missed?

* Shockproof: I'm a clutz, branches are springy, and litter carrying takes two hands.

* Preforms well in temperatures ranging from 25 to 90, F.

1. If the battery sits in my flashlight, it will lose charge won't it? Will a protected battery be fine, or should I really set a chart to recharge all my Li-Ion batteries monthly?

2. I am looking around for a new keychain flashlight. I need more power than AAA is offering, so I was looking at those CR123A/16340 whatevers. Should I be worried about a Li-Ion battery on my keychain? Like, dropping it or whatever.

3. Will it get visually dim to tip me off to recharge it? Or if I have a monthly recharging day will I even need to recharge it off that cycle?

4. I have a flashlight in my car. That one I should use primary Li-Ions in, right? It's in extreme cold. I don't mind spending 2 bucks for two new batteries (if that deal is still around.)

Basically, I don't want to mess up. I've got a flashlight upstairs that can take two 18650s, and I would enjoy using it more if I was less worried over ordering more batteries. And I'd like to get more flashlights (of course). But I want to make sure everything is good to go. Which brings me to question 5!

5. The charger I am looking at has four potential settings: 90/300/480/700 I can ask for some put on or off. If I have 18650 and the 16340/RC123A (whichever is the rechargable), which settings do I need? I see a lot of higher capacity batteries out there, something in the 2000s. Is there a setting I should get to ""future proof"" my charger?

6. Where can I buy the highest quality protected batteries?!?!

7. And if anyone has any suggestions (I was looking on DealExtreme) for my keychain light, I have a few preferences. 1. Click activated. 2. The less modes the better, preferably one. 3. BRIGHT!

The time has come where I have realized my need for a quality flashlight. Unfortunately, I really don't know what I'm doing and so I'm asking for your help.


**Purpose** - Mainly camping, however I will of course be using it around the house as well

**Size** - 6"" or under, just something easy to carry around but it doesn't need to be tiny. Weight is not an issue.

**Battery Type &amp; Quantity** - I'm not sure about this, maybe somebody can fill me in on the differences that it would make. I'll take pretty much anything that'll give me a brighter light.

**Price Range** - $125 is probably my max. Preferably $100 or under.

**Type** - Handheld

**Lumens** - Like I said, I don't know too much but I suppose the higher the better. I'll want it pretty much as bright as possible, a long as it fits my other requirements.

**Switch Type** - Doesn't matter

**Anything Else?** - Waterproof if possible, and the more durable the better",,False,self,t5_2qjmy,False,,,True,t3_1k8i37,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1k8i37/time_for_a_new_camping_flashlight_and_i_need/,

Purpose - Mostly for walking around in the dead of night, but will also occasionally be lighting up a tent or potentially mounting it on a bike -- though the latter is less important.  Reliability is important as is its ability to handle being in a very dirty environment (the Nevada desert).

Size - Large enough to take AA or 18650 batteries (see below)

Battery Type &amp; Quantity - AA or 18650.  She is taking other devices that require AA, but I also have a Fenix PD35 and a bunch of spare 18650 batteries (that particular one is staying here) -- so if there is a very efficient light out there that means she only needs to take 4 spare 18650s that would work also.  2x AA or 1x AA are fair game.

Price Range - Not all that concerned with price, as long as its nothing outrageous.

Type - Handheld and preferably a well known brand.

Lumens - Not that important as long as it is efficient or has a mode that is.  

Switch Type - No preference, as long as its nothing complicated -- im not interested in any lights that need any kind of 'hold this down for x seconds, then push it 2x, blah blah' type setups.

I love this little thing!,a11en,7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/flashlight/comments/1jxt69/quick_thanks_for_everyones_comments_re_v11r/,"I just wanted to send a quick update to the earlier self.post I made regarding the impending purchase of a Sunwayman V11r.  I was on the fence about it (first expensive flashlight to be honest), and a number of you weighed in with alternative lights and your own experiences with the V11r.

I just wanted to tip my hat, or salute you with my new light-saber, in thanks for your help!  I ended up purchasing from two places - Amazon and Goinggear.com in my search to find the latest released light and hit my near my real-life cake-day.  Amazon apparently is still shipping older V11r's.  The one they shipped me (direct from Amazon as the seller) was older than May2013's shipping.  Sunwayman reported via e-mail that anything shipped by them after May2013 would be a -U3 bin cree xml.  The only way to see this is the insert in the package- they added a sticker over the technical specs within the folded sheet inside the box.  So, don't trust the outside- you have to look inside.

After instituting a return with Amazon, I went ahead and called the shop of Goinggear.com and spoke to a human (their e-mail support got it wrong, unfortunately).  The human on the other end of the phone opened their last v11r package to check the insert- bingo- they had one.  I placed my order and it shipped that very same day!  Fantastic customer service!

I also got some goodies due to their anniversary year and the amount spent for the light.  [Below MSRP, but not as cheap as Amazon - but again, that price didn't get me the U3 bin.]

Why am I loving this thing so far?

* Low-light mode is awesome- I use it all the time- especially with a new baby in the house (sneaking into his room to check on him or back to bed without disturbing my wife)
* Max intensity is quite good even on CR123A!  At night it lights a whole room in the house quite brightly!  Stunningly bright for such a small little light.  Anything in this range and size would be great for anyone indoors in my opinion.
* Snagged the AA converter- nice to have the flexibility, only problem I've experienced is difficulty making contact to it- so I have to work on that a bit.
* Of course now I want that 3.7volt recharger. ;)  Now to read up on cells.

I already am cheating on this little light thinking of others for other purposes- so I'm afraid I might have caught some sort of bug from you lot.  Let's hope it's not too painful a disease! ;)

Thanks a ton for your suggestions and great to find this subreddit!  Big Cheers!

Edit 1: Just decided to try out the metal button that was included (original button style -v- shipped rubber button).  I'm pleasantly surprised.  Not as bad as some made it out to be.  It is a bit weird, as it has a lot more play than I thought (could be an altered button -v- original?)- it didn't seem to bind up at all- and had much more play than I was originally expecting.  So- perhaps they tried to fix the binding problem.  It is a lot different than the rubber button, but kinda fun at the same time.  Will stick it out for a bit with the metal button.

Also- Kudos to whoever mentioned that the max-mode has zero lag when momentary button presses are used.  I was a bit disappointed in the speed of the momentary press (mini ramp up when turned on) but apparently in maximum power (ring turned fully to max) there is no ramp!

I was issued the usual flashlight, you know, the one that they've issued since Vietnam. Right angle, filters and a spare bulb in the endcap, OD green plastic and nigh on indestructible, runs on 2 D cells, clips on backpacks and stands by itself. The thing is great, I used my dad's when I was a kid out camping and such and now I have my own. The only problem is that the beam is average with fresh batteries and degrades fairly fast. Besides that, my eyesight isn't the greatest in the dark which makes it pretty much useless. 

So I got to thinking, what could I do to make this flashlight worth carrying on FTXs and such? I EDC a 6PX Pro Surefire and love it, but for whatever reason we're required to take our issued light with us and if I have to have it, I'd like it to be useful. 

Only catch is that I have minimal access to tools and I'm not the greatest with soldering and such (my forte is more directed towards wiring houses and installing light switches.) I can figure most stuff out, I'm good with my hands and can improvise pretty well, but I'd rather use the KISS method here. I was thinking some sort of new bulb and maybe using D-&gt;AA converters?

**Anything else** - Absolutely do not care about looks, fancy features. I just want a simple small/medium flashlight that will hold up to abuse, perform well and doesn't require any special or speciality items such as batteries/holsters etc

I need a new flashlight. I collect insects for my PhD work, specifically [Neuroptera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroptera) at night. Most are collected using a mercury vapor light sheet setup similar to [this one](http://6legs2many.wordpress.com/techniques/light-sheet/). 

However, others such as antlions and green lacewings are not always attracted to lights. I am currently using a [coleman flashlight](http://www.sears.com/coleman-2aa-low-powered-led-aluminum-flashlight/p-SPM6841242308?prdNo=4&amp;blockNo=4&amp;blockType=G4&amp;PDP_REDIRECT=false&amp;s_tnt=39869:4:0) (that appears to be discontinued) that I picked up at walmart for about ~$25.

It works decently, but I'd like to upgrade to a better one. The current one works at close range, but it's really important for me to sweep a grassy field with light and find these insects from a short distance. Higher lumen the better. Any suggestions?

Another interesting thing to note is that I've noticed Neuroptera eyes reflect the light back at a high intensity purple, almost at the upper range of human vision. So I have had great success finding specimens by the eye shine. (Spider eyes look more like...multicolored diamond shine, etc)

Requirements:
-Can last ~3-4 hours (9pm til 1am)
-Rechargeable batteries (I can keep spares and have the spent ones charge overnight)
-outputs a high amount of light
-disperses the light so I can use my peripheral vision (not a straight beam of light, I want to light up a moderate amount of a field)

At this point, an ideal flashlight is more important than worrying about the cost. A headlamp recommendation would be great too.

* I have [read](http://www.asos1.com/flashlight/flashlight01.htm) that they often can't produce enough current to power some LED flashlights.  How can I find out if they would work with the Streamlight?

* I see many different types of RCR123's listed: different voltages (3.0V, 3.6V), different charge capacities (900mAh, 750mAh), etc.  How do I know which type to use with the flashlight?

* How do I find out how much current the batteries can produce in order to know if it's enough to power my light?  Stores/websites all mention charge capacity, but I've never seen any mention of current, even though it apparently matters a lot.

* The voltage of a battery will fade as its charge is depleted, right?  Does that mean max current supply will change as a function of voltage?  If so, how do I find out that function in order to ensure current *stays* high enough even say when the battery is 80% discharged?

* Do all RCR123's use the Li-ion chemistry, or are there different chemistries I need to consider also?

* I know I'm supposed to buy ""a smart charger"" (whatever that means) if I don't want to accidentally set my building on fire, but that's all I know about chargers.  What other aspects of the charger are important for me to consider?

What is it that attracts you to flashlights such that you would actually join a
flashlight subreddit? It seems like such a mundane interest. For me, it would
have to be the novel technology and the hope that someone has built a better
mousetrap. I am always hopeful that the bulb/LED I am about to buy will be
brighter, use less energy, be more reliable, and last longer. The absolute
worst thing for me is when I'm in a situation, push the button, and the light
doesn't work. In addition to home and auto use I'm a pilot and need light to
pre-flight aircraft or use in the cockpit, especially in emergency situations.
When I fly I've always got at least 3 lights on me and I've never been caught
in the dark, despite having actually needed my lights when the aircraft lights
have failed a couple of times.

My lights:

Photon Micro-lights - Sold by photonlight.com although my first one actually
came from thinkgeek.com. My first LED light. First got one back around 2001.
Yes, they are cheap and quite dim compared to the photon cannons being sold
now. But they last forever and have never let me down. Often all it takes is
just a tiny bit of light in a dark situation to solve the problem. Picked up a
couple more over the years.  They seem to last forever. One on my keychain, one
on my wife's keychain, one in my flight bag as a backup. This is my ""EDC"" as I
can't stand anything bigger than this dangling from my keychain.

Proton - My next light, also from photonlight.com. This light has white and red
LED, morse code, strobe, SOS, etc. All controlled by one button. This is the
light that introduced me to flashlight ""feature creep"". All I want is a light.
On. Off. Simple. Like wax-on, wax-off. Not wax-on with a swirly pattern while
Mr. Miyagi balances a rice bowl on his head. But hardly anyone seems to make
simple lights now. They all have different modes so that if I turn the light
off and on too fast I'm accidentally in some weird mode. That's really
annoying. All of my Fenix lights have this issue also to varying degrees. I
originally purchased the Photon around 2007. It is discontinued, replaced by
Photon Pro as of 2009. First one I received was assembled cross-threaded so the
battery could not be accessed without destroying it. Explained the problem via
email to photonlight.com, ""Rudy"" replied, coordinated with the original
manufacturer, gave me an address to send my broken light, a few weeks later a
perfect replacement arrived.  Good service! I still keep this in the glove
compartment of my car.

Pak-lite: I love the simplicity of these things. Just a tiny little circuit
board which snaps onto the top of a 9v battery. I have 2 red and 1 white. I use
one of the reds on a lanyard around my neck while flying at night, keep another
red in my car, have the white in the garage.

Fenix L2D - My next light. Worked ok but the endcap failed and then was a real
pain to get off. I found candlepowerforums.com and started this thread about
the problem:
http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/showthread.php?337563-L2D-disassembly-and-tr
After investing a lot of work just to get it off I ended up buying a new
tailcap. Thanks to eliteled.com for coming through with an old replacement part
when everyone else were long since sold out of them. This light now sits in the
garage. I learned during the above thread not to use alkaline batteries and now
have Eneloop NiMH AA powering my stuff.

Fenix LD20 - I keep this in my flying bag and use it for preflighting aircraft
at night. It has done a couple weird things, including being dead when it
really shouldn't have been, having been used only once previously on that set
of batteries a few weeks earlier. This is one of those lights that occasionally
goes into a weird mode. Sometimes I wonder if it isn't really completely off when I think
it is or somehow using power in some other way.

Fenix LD41 - This is a very nice light. Had it for over a year now, never had a
problem. It sits in the livingroom for use in the yard at night and gets
occasional use.

And now, thanks to having discovered this subreddit, as of last night I have a
Fenix PD32 T6 UE on the way along with a couple of 18650's, and a NiteCore
IntelliCharger i2. This will probably go into my flightbag with the LD20 going
to my wife's car. I had pretty well standardized on NiMH AA's but this more
powerful battery technology intrigues me so I'm going to give it a try.

I suspect this will be enough flashlights for quite a while and don't
anticipate my collection getting any bigger until something dies or there is
significant advance in technology. Super capacitors can't get here fast enough!
:)

While not technically flashlights, I really like LED technology so about a year
ago I also picked up these:
http://www.amazon.com/Pack-Wireless-Motion-Sensor-Lights/dp/B005ESER02/ref=sr_1_
I have one hung in the front and back of the house from a nail in the fascia boards. Works great for
a security light or just to illuminate the sidewalk when passing through. I also have a couple
Philips LED lights around the house. They are still pricey but prices are coming
down and eventually I expect my house to be incandescent-free.

Is this something that I can expect to happen to all lights, given enough time, or are some brands better or worse than others? 
Is there any difference in ""disassembleability""? I'm not afraid to break out the soldering iron to fix something, if necessary, but I need to be able to get at the components in the first place.

I am not going to combine this with questions on what to buy, as I have not really decided on a size yet, and this is more on the topic of what is

Also, I recently moved to a place where electricity outages happen once every month or so. So I want it to double as a makeshift lantern as well.

I tried doing my own research, but the sheer amount of brands and offerings is just overwhelming (which is a good thing in a way).

* Purpose: daily + lantern.

* Size: fits into my backpack.

* Battery type &amp; quantity: don't care, as long as they're rechargeable and ""modern"" (lithium). I would prefer to have a longer runtime, so a battery extender / long tube / big batteries are welcome. My target is more than an hour of runtime at ~400 lumens, but the longer the better.

* Price Range: under $100 is desirable, under $150 is workable, under $200 is a must.

* Lumens: Above 400, ideally up to 800. As far as I know, diffused light loses a lot of ""punch"" - a regular 60W incandescent is 800.

* Switch Type: Don't care. I prefer something with a ""dial"" for brightness, as, say, 4 brightness settings feels limiting to me.

Since this will be used as a lantern, I'd like the flashlight to be able to tail-stand, but I can prop it up if necessary.

I need it to have either head-less candle mode (180 degree flood), or a very wide-angle diffuser head. I'd love to have 100+ degree flood so I can stand it on top of my desk and work during an outage. From what I've seen, regular diffusers that go on top of an existing head only spread the flood to 90 degrees at most - not sure if it's me or they all work like that. 

Existing research:

* ThruNite TN30. It seems great overall (great size, battery life, UI). I'm not sure if it has candle mode, and it's pricey. EDIT: removed TN31

* Olight M30. I'd like more battery life and more brightness settings.

* Tiablo A / AG: a few of them look good, but do they have good diffusers / candle mode? Also, I'd love more battery life.

Also, I hear that there are compatible ""P60"" heads and bodies - maybe I can buy a diffuser / flooder head separately? What's the current opinion on these?

I've spent considerable time searching through this subreddit and have found much helpful information. Thanks!

I feel like I am missing my ideal flashlight though and am posting to see if my desired list of features rings a bell with anyone. Thanks, in advance, for your help.

I currently EDC a [Fenix EO1.](http://www.amazon.com/Fenix-E01-Compact-LED-Flashlight/dp/B001GAOO6Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355231114&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=fenix+eo1) I love the small size and light weight. This is very important to me. If I could add a tail click switch to the E01 that would be great. If it had a second, brighter mode, even better.

     Purpose: EDC on keychain. Must have a way to securely attach to keychain.

    Size: The smaller the better. Fenix EO1 is what I have now and it is under 3"" long. I can probably accept up to 3.5"" long and still feel okay.

    Battery type &amp; quantity: I'm guessing I need to stick to one AAA for the best small size flashlight, both in length and circumference but, if there is something else I don't know, I'm open.

    Price Range: Not a major limiting factor. It would be nice to be approx. $50 or less but I don't mind indulging myself within reason.

    Lumens: at least 5 to 10 lumens on the low end minimum. Even better, but not a deal breaker, would be a higher setting of approx. 20 lumens or more.

    Switch Type: Tail or side click. There are lots of twist switch flashlights out there and I am open to a twist switch, if absolutely necessary, but I often seem to have my hands full when I need my flashlight and I would prefer the easy one-handed switch operation that the tail click switch offers.

I'm looking for a flashlight to keep in the car. I'd like one that either comes with or has a available to buy with, a traffic cone / signal, [like this](http://flashlightsunlimited.com/images/Inova/TrafficCones.jpg).

Purpose: General usage, car troubles at night, traffic directing

Size: I'm generally flexible for size, but I'm not looking for something huge. 

Battery type &amp; quantity: I'm a little unexperienced in this field. On one hand, rechargeable batteries definitely have a cost advantage, but the idea that I can be stuck without having anywhere to recharge them whereas I can probably buy other kind of batteries in a corner store (at a price, granted) if I need them fast, is appealing. I suppose if I were to go with rechargeable, I could always keep a spare. Advice appreciated on this.

Price Range: &lt; 100$? I could probably go a little over depending of circumstances.

Lumens: Bright enough to be seen from far with the signal / traffic cone on, and as far as lighting when using it normally, I have no clue. Something good I guess.

Switch Type: I'm fond of the tail switches, but I'm thinking that might be less useful than a side switch if using a traffic / signal cone. I suppose I'm flexible on that.

Anything else: I'd love if it could somehow be programmed into different modes or at the very least have different modes. Ideal world, there would be two modes: One of continuous lighting, and one with a kind of strobing between low and high lighting, for use with the traffic cone to get attention.

Is this unrealistic? I appreciate any and all suggestions. I did just a little research and stumbled upon [this](http://flashlightsunlimited.com/inovat4r.htm), but I have no clue whether it's good or not, and the site from 1999 doesn't help.

*  **Anything else**: I would like to put the light on some kind of quick-release detachable clasp from the rest of my keys.

That's not really a desirable feature for me, and I won't be using the pocket clip.  I'd prefer a larger or more robust ring in the middle so that I can attach this directly to a key-chain.  

*  Does anybody here use the Maratac AA or AAAs as key chain lights?  
*  How do you have them mounted?

The iTP clip [looks a little more like what I'm looking for](http://i.imgur.com/JVJuJ.jpg), but it's hard to tell.

*  Is the clip shown detachable?  Does anybody have any experience with it?
*  I can't find the iTP versinos in the newest 115 lumen output variant that Maratac is selling.  

Can anybody who owns either of these comment on the clip situation?  What do you use?

I'm looking for suggestions on the larger torch.  I have 3x [TechLite 200 ""Lumen Master""](http://www.amazon.com/Techlite-Master-High-Intensity-Tactical-Flashlight/dp/B0074D6PE6)s I bought from Costco awhile ago that are serving car/house duty for now.  Pretty happy with those for the $20 I paid, but I'd like something a little more serious with a better tail clip for EDC to/from work.

*  **Purpose**: EDC carry for tactical/emergency uses.  I'll be carrying it on the outside of my laptop bag to/from work at night in a downtown area. 
*  **Size**: Normal size.  Less than 9"", I guess.  Pretty flexible here.
*  **Batteries**:  I'll use low internal discharge AA or AAAs if possible.  I'm open to 2-3x battery lights or other battery options if it's necessary/optimal to get the light output and run time up where I want them. 
*  **Price Range**: Flexible.  Ideally &lt;$100.
*  **Lumens**: 150(+) on high.
*  **Switch type**: Side or tail.
*  **Anything else**: Some sort of one-handed quick-release system and it needs to be robust enough to bang around a bit on the outside of my bag.

Lumens:  No real pref, as long as it does the above in ""purpose""

**Specs**
*LED: CREE XM-L T6
*Maximum output: 500 lumens
*Reflector: Custom-designed precision metal reflector
*Lens: Double-sided toughened mineral glass with anti-reflective coating
*Material: TC4 Titanium Alloy
*Battery: RCR123*1 / CR123A*1
*Standby current: 50μA
*Switch: Rapid Response Control Ring
*IPX-8 standard waterproof (2 meters submersible)
*Dimensions: Tube diameter 23mm, Total length 81mm
*Weight: 67g (without battery)
*Price* $180

[Sunwayman V10R-Ti+](http://www.sunwayman.com/html/products/201203/84.html)
**Specs**
*CREE XM-L U2 LED, with a lifetime of up to 50,000 hours;
*Digital Sensor Magnetic Control system, Infinite Variable Output Switch- slightly twist the Rotator Ring from left to right for Min to Max output.
*Turbo Mode: 500 Lumens (uses one 16340 battery to drive; Do not run the light continuously at turbo mode for more than 5 minutes.)
*Max: 190 Lumens (1.5hrs)
*Min: 1 Lumen (35hrs)
*Constant current circuit, constant output
*Effective range of 130 meters
*Uses one single CR123A (RCR123A/16340) battery
*Working voltage: 0.9~4.2V
*High quality OP reflector maintains great throw distance and spread with an ideal beam pattern
*Dimensions: 84.5mm (length) x 23mm (head diameter)
*Weight: 71.8g（battery excluded）
*Price* $160

So price wise, they seem around the same. Spec wise, the Sunwayman says not to run the light at max brightness for more than 5 minutes - while the Jetbeam has no such warning.

This would also come in handy if I am carrying a firearm, because I carry at 4-O'clock, but I don't EDC a firearm. Main purpose would be just to have a better source of light than my photon keyring light while walking in the dark or to luminate dark rooms/hallways. I would also like a strobe mode for disorienting an attacker if need be. 

**Size:** 3 inches in length and under an inch in diameter.

**Battery type &amp;amp; quantity:** Single CR123A or AA

**Price Range:** Under $50

**Lumens:** 100+ in max mode.

**Switch Type:** Clickie-button on back.

**Anything else:** Prefer first mode to be Low beam, then High, and Strobe. Don't need SOS or Beacon or anything. I would also prefer a lanyard hole for easier draw.

Hello /r/flashlight,

I'm about to make the jump into the world of flashlights by purchasing my first light. I am stuck between the new Olight S15 XM-L2 and older Nitecore EA1 XP-G. I prefer the dual-button layout of the NiteCore EA1, but I have also heard the UI of the Olight is still very good/usable. (Are there any other lights have have a similar dual-button layout?)

My criteria was:

- Anything with a button, simply no twisting action

- $25-$45

- Useful Lo-Mid-Hi spacing with no strobe (unless they are hidden.)

- 1xAA (Using Lithium primaries)

A few other lights I was considering was the Xeno E03 and Lumapower LM31. 

**Questions:** 

1) Which would you recommend/carry? 

2) Can either of these accidentally turn on in pocket? (Even with the lock function?)

3) Any complaints about the UI on either?

4) Would you agree that the floody XML2 on the Olight is probably better for EDC use than the throwy XPG on the Nitecore?

5) Any other recommendations based on the criteria?

[I have no lights in this price range yet.]  I'm also intrigued by the new Fenix PD35 (after seeing the cute PD22- which I also kinda like).

But, I'm thinking the versatility of switching between cells and the pocketability of the v11r is swaying me in this direction.  I feel comfortable around the $100 mark, if the light is what I love (an intangible for most of us, but we get the fuzzies when we learn more about it).

That crazy lumen of the PD35 is sure intriguing.  But, being that I tend to like this small to throw in my backpack for everyday carry, I'm thinking the v11r will be more versatile and possibly pocketable than something of the PD35's size.

Open to all comments/suggestions!  I appreciate everyone's thoughts!  (anyone taken that AA adapter ring and bored out the inside to hold a slightly larger cell for more life?)  Do you have the V11r and love it?  the PD32/35?

Thanks for the great subreddit!!

EDIT - is the v11r due for an upgrade to another cree module?  (am I buying at a bad time?) - any plusses/minuses between the SRT3 -v- v11r?

EDIT2 - Turns out some lights are shipping with XML-U3's now instead of the U2's.  That's nice to know.  Contacted the possibly seller I'd buy from- we'll see their response.  I believe that the person who showed the updated cree module light had purchased from goinggear.com.  (seen on candelpower forum in this [thread](http://www.candlepowerforums.com/vb/printthread.php?t=338094&amp;pp=50&amp;page=3))

EDIT3 - A quick talk with Sunwayman confirms that since May2013 they have been shipping an updated V11r with the XML-U3 emitter.  I asked them about the XML2- they said in the future they'll likely update, but they don't have a time-frame for it.  They were very kind and offered help finding local dealers with the upgraded product.  [Being the slave to the internet I am, I'm still trying to get it from Amazon on prime. :) ]  A question to EdisonBright about their Amazon warehoused products says that they're a mix of U2/U3 likely.

EDIT4 - Amazon is not yet shipping U3 models (return instituted).  Goinggear.com was fantastic on the phone (yes they have a physical store staffed with real humans!).  At first their e-mail support didn't realize what they had, told me they were out of the newer V11r's... then I got them on the phone the other day (after the Amazon shipment came) and the fellow looked inside the box at the inner pamphlet (only place they indicate the update).  Turns out their stock is the updated model and one was left!  He mentioned he would hold it for me until the web order went through, and bam, within an hour of talking with them on the phone, I got a shipment notification.  Serious props to Goinggear.com!

So, I'm thinking no more than $1,500 in inventory to start. I was considering sourcing from Alibaba for the Chinese bit, but I'm not sure of good wholesalers for the more reputable brands. I might also sell a few batteries and chargers.

I will be doing extensive hiking, exploring, and misc stupid things in the dark and my current $10 headlamp honestly does not give me enough illumination to feel secure when I am in the middle of nowhere/bear country. The headlamp will also double as my new EDC pack light. I currently use my old one extensively so don't mind spending a fair amount on something I will be using for at least 3-5 years.

I've been scouring and have come across a few headlamps that appear to be touted. However, since I am not thoroughly versed I figured you folks might be able to help me out. Here are the specifications I am hoping to meet.

&gt;**Purpose** - Hiking, backpacking, EDC

&gt;**Size** - No extended batteries. Weight and its symmetrical distribution are factors

&gt;**Battery Type &amp; Quantity** - AAA &amp; AA are preferred; 2-4. If I am mistaken in this preference please educate me.

&gt;**Price Range** - 40-80

&gt;**Type** - Headlamp

&gt;**Lumens** - I feel like I should be aiming for 70+ lumens

&gt;**Switch Type** - Not important

&gt;**Anything Else?** - Throw, Flood, and intensity control are important to me. I am hoping to obtain versatility and recognize that will likely be a cost point. There will be water... I don't intend to be swimming with the headlamp but heavy downpours will occur. How water resistant/proof should I be aiming for? Should I be concerned about alkaline batteries leaking and ruining my device? Locking modes is also rather important.


I've been reading the boards and scouring online for several hours now and have a few headlamps I feel might be right for me but I would like second opinions on:

http://www.rei.com/product/814301/black-diamond-storm-headlamp

http://www.rei.com/product/826319/black-diamond-spot-headlamp

http://www.rei.com/product/829554/petzl-tikka-xp-2-headlamp

Black Diamond appears to have quality issues which is very concerning. As for Zebralights in general... they look like very high quality products but their battery life... leaves a lot to be wanted. Can someone explain to me why their products are so often suggested for outdoor activities if their headlamps don't have the life of other brands like Petzi?

What I have is a Solarforce L2P body (2x CR123 rechargeables) with a XM-L single mode drop in LED bulb. Its very bright.

My second light is about the same size, it's a UTG weaponlight with a momentary tailpiece, with the same XML-2 drop in bulb, and the same batteries. This light has more ""fins"" to the body, and therefore doesn't get as hot as fast, but it still heats up quite a bit.

Thanks everyone for your time!

**Edit:** Thanks to everyone who gave their input. I learned a lot. I went for the PD32 after all. I'll give this one a go as my EDC and then once I start the job maybe I'll consider something different at that time.

**Lumens** I haven't a clue. If someone could give me a short lesson on what's good, that be fantastic! But really, just something that's relatively bright, has a good distance, and doesn't have to much spread, if that makes sense?

I have a problem with always wanting the best bang for the buck item that isn't sold at any crappy local store so when it came to throwing together my flight bag, I knew I needed to get a great flashlight. And who else could I come to but you guys, I hope!


Purpose: Will be used for Pre-flight inspections (walk arounds) during the evenings, and otherwise will be solely used for emergency situations and will be left in my flight bag a lot of the time.

Size: Needs to fit in this elastic spot in this [bag](http://imgur.com/07BK9pG). Swiss army knife added for size reference.


Battery type &amp; quantity: My headset takes AA's so I always carry a bunch with me, I'd prefer to stick with that if possible. I generally have a spare 8-pack with me.

Price Range: $50-80

Lumens: I honestly tried to look into this but I don't really know where to start. I need it to have a nice bright, neutral (white?) colored light. I'd like it to have a high intensity so that I can clearly see what I am trying to illuminate.  

Switch Type: No preference.

Anything else:  I'd like this thing to be durable as it may be knocked around, hit into something, who knows.

 **Purpose**: I have a [Nylon 66](http://i.imgur.com/ojYBKFE.jpg) rifle that I'm currently using for home defense. (Not ideal, but some gun is better than no gun and I can't afford a shotgun atm) The gun was not designed to have attachments added onto it so there is no rail. Nonetheless, I need to attach a small, lightweight, bright light to the end of it because I currently cannot see down the stairs into the darkness of my house at night. Since I am intending this for use in relatively close quarters, I'm looking for something more on the floody end of the spectrum.


 **Size**: Under 4 inches, not overly thick and heavy. I have about 4 inches of barrel after the forestock ends.


 **Battery type &amp; quantity**: AA to AAA. I need it low in weight. I don't plan on using this light often, though I can check the batteries regularly.


 **Price Range**: The cheaper the better. I could buy a new shotgun for $300, so I don't want to spend 1/3 of that on a flashlight attachment for this small rifle. If I had to name a number, $50 would really be pushing it.


 **Lumens**: It's 34ft from the back of my kitchen straight to my front door. Whatever it takes to adequately light that area up.


 **Switch Type**: Ideally I need a pressure switch on the end of a cord, something I can use to turn the light on from the middle of the stock with my left hand, or farther back with my right hand. If this is not possible then at least a switch on the back of the light I could reach forward and turn on.


 **Anything else**: Something terrifying like a ""Hello Kitty"" or ""Dora the Explorer"" design is a plus, but not critical.

EDIT: Links with Referrals also get caught in the spam filter, meaning people don't see your entire post until it's cleared by the mods

Unfortunately, quickly pasting from google will occasionally bring up a referral url. Therefore we ask that everyone takes a quick second or two and remove the referral bit.


This is a referral link (the ref= is the give away)

This is a link without a referral link

So by removing everything after 'ref=', you remove the referral and the link will still work.

I'm currently living/working in Costa Rica and have a window of opportunity for a few Amazon-purchases goods to be delivered. I'm working on improving my EDC and need a flashlight upgrade. I've been using my MiniMag incan. for about 12 years now and think it's time to upgrade.

Thank you for any advice and I really appreciate your time.
Here's the lowdown:

**Purpose:** 
* Every night I have to walk about 300m up a steep-incline dirt road, surrounded by jungle, in COMPLETE darkness. 
* When I work as a guide, I often work inside our 4-story, concrete rockwall. The power goes out ALL THE TIME, but tours don't stop. I need to be able to navigate stairwells, offices artificial caves and tunnels. 
* General EDC (for when I'm stateside, as well). Ever since I started using a flashlight here, I know I'll feel naked without it, even in the States.

**Size:** 
I wanted something keychain or stylus-sized — for pocket or keychain carry. No more heavy MiniMag, please!

**Battery type &amp; quantity:** 
AA/AAA (1 or 2) — Being abroad, I don't have access to eccentric battery-types.

**Price Range:** 
Less than $30 — the gf and I share everything, including money.

**Lumens:**
I'm new to researching lights, so I'm not sure how many I need for my intended purposes, but I like large numbers!

**Switch Type:** 
Clicky is preferred, but I've been using Twisty my whole life, so that's OK, too.

**Anything else:** WATERPROOFING and CORROSION RESISTANCE are a must. I literally live in the rain forest and spend some days on a riverbank.

Thanks, guys! I'm looking forward to what you have to say. Here are the two I'd been considering:

I've been trying to decide on a new EDC light, but I'd love your opinions. Currently I'm carrying a [Sunwayman C10A](http://www.sunwayman.com/html/products/201008/40.html). I'm pretty satisfied with the features it's got (IPX-8 waterproof, 3/30/140 Lumens, removable pocket clip, and the size is perfect for carrying). I carry it every day, but lately it's not been reliably turning on. Occasionally I have to open it up and close it back up to get the light to come on. I'm going to check it for grease at the contacts, and then I might try some cleaning solution. In the meantime, I'm hoping to find something a bit more reliable. I know you lot love foursevens and fenixes around here, so I'm more than happy to entertain those as suggestions. Here's what I'd like out of my new EDC:

* AA (this is a must. I already have a 4-pack of Sanyo XX Eneloops and a charger that I carry around with me in a camera bag. I'll entertain a 2xAA, but like I said, I'd really like it to be as small as possible)

* Lumen output: I'm pretty flexible, especially if the light has a pretty good range of modes, but I think I'd like &gt;90

* Pocket clip would be nice. I could work with a pouch, though.

* Tail-standing would be preferred.

* Waterproof is always useful, but not strictly necessary.

Basically I'm looking for a 1x AA light with the most output I can get. My LD-10 does 120 lumens at max output (I got the Q5). I don't really care about runtime at max output (if it'll do 30 minutes on a fresh battery I'm fine).

I was thinking of buying the [QT2A-X](http://www.foursevens.com/product_info.php?products_id=2933) and putting an A series body on it (basically I'd end up with a QTA with a CREE XM-L emitter). Will this increase the output of the light over the QTA's 109 lumens? Should I be using something other than a AA in the flashlight?

I have been researching flashlights just long enough to start going crazy with the vast amount of different types of lights. I am hoping someone much more knowledgeable in the subject than myself can help me out. 

I am looking for a light to mount to the handle bars on my dirtbike for trailriding. I have been riding with this light mounted to my helmet [KL4.5LM](http://www.goldenfuturecn.com/sdp/328267/4/pd-1392025/1782767-1108075/intrinsically_safety_mining_safety_cap_lamp_caplig.html) The light has a very focused beam and I think will be good to continue using strictly as a headlamp. My speed is limited using this light alone and of course, I would like to go faster :)

I am hoping that someone can recommend me a LED light that I could use to mount to my handlebars to give me a bit more flood light (or is the right term spill?). I am also hoping that having two lights will help with depth perception. 

 I have seen a whole bunch of lights running the cree xm-l LEDs. Is this the type of LED that I should be looking for in a light?

I would prefer a flashlight that I can detatch from the mount after riding and use as a camping flashlight, but I am not opposed to a specific purpose bar mounted light either if it makes the most sense. 

The brighter the better, obviously. 900+ lumens. I would prefer a few modes on the light so that i do not have to use the max brightness if I want to conserve batteries. 

I would prefer a battery run time of min 3 hours. Perhaps this one is not a realistic request...

I would also like to keep it under 100 dollars if possible. I am not opposed to deal extreme lights if someone can vouche for them

 I am definitely a noob when it comes to LED lights (or any for that matter) so if any of my requests/assumptions are not realistic please enlighten me (pun intended)

Thanks!

edit #1

I have narrowed my choices down to two options, and it seems as though i will have to re-adjust my budget on this project:

option 1: get a magicshine MJ 816E and then a jetbeam PA40 as a camping light 

option 2: get only a Fenix TK35 and use it for both. 

Has anyone had experience with the TK35? Would it have enough flood to use as a bikelight? From reading reviews, it seems that this light would definately be powerful enough.

Edit #2

After much research, I ended up getting a Zebralight SC600 cool white version. I am more than impressed with this little light. It puts out more than I expected and i was able to ride about half of the normal speed on the trails, maybe a little more. This is pretty good considering normal speed is usually as hard as I can ride (trying not to cross that fine line into out of control of course).  I tried to get some video, but my GoPro is less than ideal in night time conditions and does not do how light it actually was justice. When I have some extra cash, I think I will pair the bar mounted Zebralight with the Jetbeam BC40 mounted to my helmet as a spot light. 

I think the Zebralight was among best I could have gotten for a durable, bright as hell, multi-use light. I was quite surprised with its size as well. I expected a bigger light. This was an excellent surprise! There are better lights for riding I am sure, but there are also many more much worse lights. For messing around at night the odd weekend, and for the cost, I am glad that I went with this light.

    Size: Size isn't too big of a deal as long as it's within reason - current light is about 9 inches long by about an inch and a half in diameter at the lamp and about an inch at the body.

    Battery type &amp; quantity: not picky here. 

    Price Range: Would prefer to stay under about 75 bucks, but could be convinced to maybe spend more.

    Lumens: 150-200 range preferable, but as long as it's bright enough to disorient at night I'm good with it.

    Switch Type: Using a tape switch right now, but I could never find a good way to mount it so I may just go for a push button switch on the cap.

    Anything else: The current light is a xenon and the bulb busted somehow - either by having the gun lugged around or maybe just the shock of being on the business end of the 12g. Either way, it seems that LED is a must this time. I'm also looking for something with a rail mount.
