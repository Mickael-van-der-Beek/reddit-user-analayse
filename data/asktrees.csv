*  I go to a christian college and would like to know if they can access my medical records and if it is possible for me to get prosecuted by the school in any way (suspension, expulsion or drug testings).

* I am still on my parents medical insurance plan and would like to know if there is any way that they can see that I would have my MMJ card  .

* Are there any other risks that I should be aware of if I decide to get it? (i.e. job discrimination, any possible federal raid dangers, etc.)

To me, it means subverting something that came as a mark of societal progress, and making those who actually NEED medical marijuana look worse. I think very few people take medical marijuana seriously, and one big reason is that the vast majority (I think it's safe to say) of patients are just using it as a backdoor to legal, recreational weed. So my question is for cardholders that have put actual thought into it, not just as an easy way to get bud. Do you feel that what you do is right, and if so, how do you justify it?

These websites, run by anti-drug groups are just full of aggressive words an scare tactics dressed up to look like facts. But it's this information that gets spoon fed to people who automatically just believe it as the utter truth.
These groups use the same words and terminology to describe everything from cannabis to heroin, lumping them all under the same flag.

When you try trees for the first time, and realize that it hasn't turned you crazy/into a junkie/dead, you start to question whether all the scary facts you've heard about other drugs are false as well. 

The one day Your dealer tells you he's out of weed but has some other drug for the same price. You go to look it up and all you find are pages and pages of 'information' about how the first time will kill you, you'll get brain damage, you will become violent and suicidal. ""This is stuff they also said about weed,"" you think ""so it must be bullshit too.""
So you go get $50 of meth from your dealer, he asks if you got a pipe and you say you don't so he shows you how to bump it. BAM.
3 days later, your house is as clean as its ever been, you think you understand everything a lot better than you do and your brain feels like its just way too open. But damn man, you could sure as shit do that again for the next 5 years straight.

Whatn im getting at is does someone know where to get actual information about drugs? Why is heroin bad? How does meth kill you? How much LSD can you take without breaking?

Not a place that actively promotes drug use, because that would just be equally as bad, but a place where people can get hard science facts to make up their own minds?

I've always wanted to ask /r/asktrees a question, because I have this problem, and here I am. My friend got me into smoking weed last year. At first, I thought, ""Hah, weed doesn't affect me,"" but I was very wrong lol. And wrong for a bloody good reason. I freaking love weed now, but I take it in moderation because that's just my style. Anyway, onto my story.

My friend and I have always been adrenaline junkies since we were kids. We went from doing biking shit, to parkour, to trees. But lately, he has been wanting to try more drugs, like shrooms and acid. Now, I know the arguments (lol, I've heard them all from him) and I just want to say that I'm okay with whatever *your* style is. It's cool with me, man. But my friend, he wants me to try these other drugs with him. Now, mind you, he also showed me reddit, which I think that's pretty damn cool of him. So, I know that he's not necessarily wrong in wanting to try shrooms and acid if he knows what he wants to get into. I just don't want to trip that way myself. Yeah, yeah, I know I should ""try anything new"" before making my opinion on things. But honestly, I'm fine with my weed. It makes me feel good, which I like. It's not about some ""coolness"" factor that kids get from smoking it. I dunno, you guys get what I mean. My friend is just so persistent with getting me to try other stuff though. I'm introverted enough as it is because that's me. He'll thinks I should go to parties and concerts and try harder drugs. I just don't want to. I've tried arguing with him over not doing certain stuff at times, and he gets a little pushy. I feel like he no longer understands me anymore, even though I'm trying to explain my reasoning. 

Fellow ents, how do you feel when someone tries to pressure you against your natural flow?

I am considering buying a sharpstone grinder (the 5 piece one).

3. How strong are the sharpstone grinders? Can I grind food material (i.e. coffee, peppercorns, large grains of salt)?

4. Does it smell a lot? I don't want to be caught with it outside of my home.

I'm from Australia and I've been noticing a lot of differences in 'ent culture' seeing as most people who post here seem to be from the states or Canada. 


Examples: 

-Bong's are also called 'Billies' here

-Bowls are what we chop up the trees in, the bit that you smoke out of is just referred to as the cone piece or C.P

-We don't use 'dank' as an adjective here, I'm still confused by what you guys mean, sometimes it gets used as a positive and other times negative =S




The main thing I've noticed here is that people always imply that a bowl is smoked between several people which is why you 'corner the edges' and offer people the chance to 'green it'. I had never heard of this until this forum. In the circles I run in, everyone packs and smokes a bowl on their own. I was thinking maybe our cone pieces are smaller or something =S
I saw someone refer to this practice in another post: *snaps* are a bowl that's intentionally packed to be killed in one hit.



**I was wondering what is more common, sharing bowls or packing snaps?**



Also, if you aren't part of the majority, what differences have you noticed culture wise?


Edit: In case it didn't make sense, billie comes from the word billycan which is a real [aussie icon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billycan#Usage_and_etymology_of_the_term)

So, do you think it's bad form to ask to see the weed I'm buying on the scale? ~~Also, if there are large stems or seeds in it, would it be bad form for me to point it out or remove them while there and ask for more weed to bring the weight back up?~~

For the past 6 months we started hanging out daily. Since then, I've started noticing these changes on him, which I'm unsure if they're new or I just didn't see them before.
Anyhow, he's VERY greedy. Whenever someone mentions money or weed he starts drooling. Sometimes he also provides weed for people who don't want to go to the dealer, but what he does is take 60% of the weed he got and gives the rest on - so he basically steals other people's weed - and I fucking hate that he does that, because he used to deal me some weed! Also, a while back I had about 5g at his place, because I had some problems at home. When I asked him where it was he said ""we smoked it brah"", but we were smoking completely different weed and it wasn't close to 5g either. He also smokes most of the bowl by himself - when it comes to him it takes him 2 hours to pass it on and there's very little left for others.

He's also got these terrible, insulting, racist jokes that no one finds funny but himself. I feel so awkward when he tells a joke, because I can't even chuckle.. it just makes me sorta sad. 

He gets mad very easily. And I'm not talking human mad... No. What he gets is Satan mad, because I don't know anyone else in the world that would get THAT mad THAT easily. He starts cursing like he's got Tourette's syndrome. And he gets mad for nothing. A few examples: when someone crosses the street and he's in his car, when someone is driving more than 2mp/h below the max limit, when people don't listen to him, etc...

Anyhow, he became a terrible asshole, which bothers me to infinity. We were talking about living together next year in college, but now I'm afraid of that, because I don't want to live my life in depression.

Hey, so I have smoked for awhile but have recently started to be more open about it and actually do it with frients. This weekend we were out with a more experienced ent who packs his pipes differently than me. This made me wonder how other people pack/smoke, what the most popular method is, and what is the best


**Summary:**
There are many ways to smoke with a pipe how do you use your pipe, what is the most popular method, and what is the best?


**Questions:**

*Tightly packed bowl or a very loose packed one? 
I pack mine tightly.

*Ground up to be small, medium, or simply not ground at all? 
I usually aim for small.

*Only light until the leaves catch or hold lighter there?
Until leaves catch usually

*Plug the side hole while inhaling or not?
I plug it

*Grinders or fingers?
I use my fingers but I don't really know anything about grinders

*Edit: Smoke the stems or not?
I only started after a friend told me that there is THC in the stem too so there isn't a point to waste it.

I'm no poet. Have never written anything interesting, but I've seen two funny references here on /trees recently and I wanted to put them to good use and add more. 

A little back story:
I live in Japan so obviously trees are a huge nono here. I love them, and I only get to indulge when I go back to see my friends and family once a year. The ""dankrupt"" and ""joint custody"" jokes I saw on here recently inspired me to try to write a speech to say to my friends just before we smoke. In this speech, I wanted to include as many references to trees as possible. Here's what I have so far...

""Four score and twenty minutes ago, I arrived in this humble abode of yours. I need to be thankful, though, because
being dankrupt is not a funny matter. It is a matter which we need to take seriously. Something we should face with the
most blunt of arguments. If handled correctly, it is possible to get joint custody. Now, living in Japan, I must say that
the grass definitely is greener on the other side. But I digress. In order to be reunited with Mary Jane, I plan on picking
the seeds and stems out of the opposition's argument, and simply vaporizing what they have to say. It'll seem like someone
hit them other the head with a blunt instrument, ""Bong!"" Honestly though, it feels great to be back in this great nation.
With all the different people, it really is a great salad bowl. Or of course, a melting pot, as they used to say. Every
ounce of my being is ecstatic with joy to see you all. Because the value that I place in our friendship can not be measured
in nickels and dimes. But I have to say, I really missed my bud."" 

I know it might kind of make some of you groan. If anyone has anything they'd like to add then if it's good I will add it in and try to memorize the whole thing.

I have to fly across the pacific this summer, and I don't want to be bored the whole way/not be able to sleep. So I thought of a scheme to take canna caps on the plane. I already have a prescription that comes in capsules that I take every day, so I plan to fill a few of these with AVB or butter, whichever would be better. Id take these on the plane in the bottle with my legit meds and take them when I got on the plane. 

Some of you might see a problem with this plan already, however. How will he tell which pills are funky? I have a solution to this. I have two bottles of the same meds, one in a 20 mg version and one in a 10 mg version. I take both to equal 30 mg. the 20 version has two stripes, the 10 has one stripe on the capsule. So I'll take a few of the 10s, fill them with stuff, and put them in the 20 bottle and look for them when I go to take them.

 I have also smoked weed heavily when I was younger so this is not just some paranoid woman asking about how drugs are bad mmkay?

Alright now on to the elaboration!

So we live in a house split up into a few apartments. We own the whole top floor while the bottom half is split into two smaller appartments, about two months ago the people right below our bedroom moved out and some new couple quickly moved in. 

For the past two months at night our bathroom that's connected to our bedroom has been filled with this bad smell; like some crappy cooked oriental dish and its the same smell every night!

At first we wondered if it was some drug but it really smelled like some strange food so we ignored it. 

Last week while in my bedroom doing nothing I felt a sudden adrenaline rush, nothing new, whatever. Then I started to smell that smell again. The adrenaline rush made me feel really wired and it lasted all night through sleep and over my work shift the next day (slept only thanks to NyQuil). I checked my blood pressure at the store on a win after work and it was really high, kind of freaked me out. 

For a few weeks before that I've been having horrible migraines. Me and my fiancé find it harder to breathe in our apartment as the weeks go by. 

To the point: my landlord asked me to call her and she asked me if anyone in my place smoked and i told ber no, then she said some tenant that lives there is on probation and can't be around drugs. I then brought up the strange smell (btw our bathroom has no venalation whatsoever and its heated by gas). She said the other people were complaining about the same thing. 

Ion a hunch I asked a co worker what spice smells like. She described it and it did the smell perfectly!

God it really explains how we have been feeling lately and to boot. The people downstairs were pretty much accusing us of smoking (the third tenant lives on the other side of the house, nowhere near where the smell came from. 

Sorry for the wall of text but how should I go about this? If t was weed I would not care at all as I actually like the smell but that chemical spice shit is getting to us now.

I smoked about three bowls total (the most I've ever smoked) and my imagination seemed to bleed into reality. The best way I can describe it is that I thought, ""what if there was a city outside my window?"" and out of the corner of my eye, outside my window I saw a city, but I knew it wasn't real.

I was drunk but not overly so. I had some anxiety so I pulled a friend(1) to the Toking room to take a hit or two from my pipe, however when we arrived there was a man about to load up a bong.  I didn’t really want to use a bong but I thought it would go against stoner etiquette to refuse so I chipped my stuff and we filled the bowl with a mix of his and my stuff. I refused the first hit since I recall that being the most potent but got the second hit, and that was enough. My friend(1) that I pulled along was drinking heavily that night but she insisted that she would be fine also took only one hit. The other two people in the room kept toking however.

When we got up to leave I realized something was not right, we were talking to friend(2) and friend(3) when I decided to pull friend(3) aside. We went by the front door, I was having a really hard time trying to figure out how to talk. I asked her to bring me to the hospital, she kept asking what was wrong but I kept saying ‘I cannot’ because I couldn’t remember how to talk. Not long after this nice lady I met that night came over and I just collapsed without warning  thankfully she caught me and ended up dragging me to the couch all the while saying that I was like a ‘dead weight’ and I was like a dead weight. I could not move because I could not remember how to move. I thought I was dying. On the couch I realized the depth of what was forgotten: how to move, how to talk, what my bedroom looked like, where my mother lived, what my mother looked like, and everything else it was just gone. No matter how hard I tried I could not conjure up the memories, I thought I was dying. Everything was starting to fade, and I knew my breath was shallow.

I remember thinking ‘Fuck this. Dying at a house party like another no name junkie having no impact upon the world, I will not go out like this’ (Mind you I am not a junkie, I smoke weed once or twice a week and at  party like events that make me anxious). It wasn’t long after that determination that everything stopped fading, friend(4) and owner of the house came to check up on me. I remember him checking my pulse stating it was okay, he asked me to look at him but I still couldn’t remember how to move so he stated I was unresponsive, and I remember friend(3) explaining how I asked to go to the hospital. I would like to note that I do not know how long I was on the couch or how much time passed between what I remember. I recall the sense of pride when I could move my eyes to look around and control my breathing, I was trying so hard to regain control of my body to show them I was conscious and I understood what they were talking about. 

Once I had control of my eyes I was able to notice that people I knew would poke their head in through the door to check up on me, but I do not recall if anyone other than friend(4) actually talked to me. Friend(4) actually helped me immensely to regain both control and memories by asking about my snake bites (it is quite the story) which instigated a chain reaction. With some pain in my head I was hit with clarity I remembered I had snake bites, when I got each side done, how I kept losing the piercings, and I finally remembered how to talk. Everything came flooding back and I just wanted to tell everyone everything because I felt so much pride in recalling my memories. I was still having some difficulty grasping walking or perhaps I was just afraid to move a lot and talking was still difficult due to a severely dry throat, I do not remember if I ever received the water I asked for. Anyways, at one point I moved my arm from an uncomfortable position, as I held it up I remember looking at it and realizing: that it is my arm, that I am wearing bracelets, I am wearing clothing, etc.

Again I don’t know how much time passed, but friend(2) and friend(3) came to get me moving because friend(1) had apparently been puking the entire time and refused to move from the owner’s bed which was making them a bit upset. I never felt like puking before, during, or after the episode not even a little. When I sat up my head throbbed, I had to wait for that to pass before I put on my shoes which I had no issue with, but when I stood up my knees and legs shook which has never happened to me before. I managed to take a step on my quaking legs before I fell/sat back down on the couch, people kept offered to help but I refused I wanted and needed to walk out on my own. It was not long before I was in the vehicle and when we arrived at my house I was hit with some more head pain but was being rushed out friend(3) kept tapping the window waiting for me to exit the car. I easily crawled out and walked with no issue to my door.
Now, I thought I remembered everything that happened that night quite clearly, but friend(1) who is known for blurring the truth sometimes claims I was carried/helped out of the house while we were leaving. It made me realize that I don’t actually remember if I walked out on my own or not, and some other things which I have already stated.

I have no idea what happened, I have never experienced anything like it before. Someone said I may have half blacked out which I don’t know if it is possible or what blacking out is like, but apparently you function alright in that state but just don’t remember anything. Someone else said I may have ‘greened out’ which again I have never done, I have drank and toked with my pipe before with no issue but a bong does get you higher and mixing alcohol with weed does amplify some affects(effects?), and I haven’t heard any stories of ‘greening out’ really other than friend(4) who apparently did just that the week before and had to crawl from the bathroom to the kitchen. While I talked to my brother he is convinced I didn’t black-out and has never heard of ‘greening out’ before. Now, friend(1) claims that the guy we toked with was doing an experiment with crushed roofies in his weed, but he and the other person in the room smoked more than us and was completely fine, furthermore I believe he said that the weed was sitting in the room which means it was the owner’s stuff. However, it did get me thinking that it is possible that my drink may have been roofied since I did lose track of it for a bit (during the lighting of the cake and singing), but I doubt anyone there would have done that since I knew most of them and the house was small enough that if someone were to try and take advantage of me they would have been caught.

Has anyone experienced something like this before? Is greening out a thing?

TLDR: Sorry, but I feel that the details are necessary to express both the symptoms and to show how much I remember compared to what I do not. Even if I tried it would probably end up being just as long.

*  Is it possible that i will be drug tested without my knowledge or consent at this physical?

*  Is it possible that i will be drug tested at this physical and that they will ask for my consent the day of?

* Is it possible that the doctor will drug test me on his own accord? and if so can he report the results back to my employer?

A larger mouth opening would be an added bonus to using a gatorade bottle. I just want to make sure its as effective as possible. 

Also, I have made spoofs out of toilet paper rolls before which let the smoke pass all the way thru and escape on the other side. If I use a bottle would it be a good plan to poke/burn some holes in the bottom so the smoke can escape?

Been looking for a logical answer to my issue and sifting through wiki's and Google links has worn me down. 

Hopefully the baked wisdom in this corner of the interwebz can help. 

I started smoking when I was in my early teens and really didn't stop until around 23, (I'm 30 now[YIKES]). 

Towards the tail end of my serious smoking I was noticing a difference in my reaction to being high. I was not the social, engaged stoner I once was. I became introverted when high, constant anxiety and random paranoia. It stopped being fun and relaxing. So I stopped.

Since I stopped the daily ritual I've lit up on a few rare occasions over the years only to bring all that anxiety and paranoia rushing back reminding me why I stopped in the first place.

Wanting to get back to that time when I enjoyed being blazed I went out and picked up this guy [Dirty Rico](http://imgur.com/5KtGG).
My thought process is that I may just need to power smoke through this awkward phase and I'll be all good. 

Am I off my rocker with my logic? 
Is this the end my friends?

Any of you Ent's have any advice? Links? Theories? 

Thanks,

Deep_Fry

I was recently at a ten person bonfire where a few of us (including myself) had consumed a beer or two. I blew a .06 and received my very first consumption, sweet. Five of us (all 18) received  consumptions all under .08. We were then sent home with our DD's that we had set up for. After making it a block our three person car was pulled over on the grounds that we had thrown a beer bottle at the street as we were leaving. None of us had done so. Anyway a cop circled the car with a flashlight and noticed the top of a prescription pill bottle poking out a pocket seat cover. It was containing less than a gram of weed that was a friend of ours. Without asking the cop opens the door, finds the weed, and tells us to get out of the car. 

At this point I'd like to add that there was a total of FIVE squad cars. FIVE. What did they find? That original pill bottle, and two half eighths on myself and a friend of mine. When I asked the officer if it was legal to search our car he said that because we were in a car that certain laws gave him the right. Being a bunch of kids we were in no position to argue so we were powerless and had to accept the charges. So my question - is there any point in trying to reverse the possession charges in court or should I accept the charges. I know I broke the law by drinking a beer and possessing marijuana, I'm just wondering if they had grounds to search our vehicle. I know for a fact that no bottle was thrown or broken. The ten kids at this fire are all smart responsible young adults and wouldn't do that. We even drove back to check the street.

4)If i test positive, will it affect employment opportunities later in life?

I have a question for you, I'm with a little problem: me and my ex-girlfriend were talking in these last days and we want to try dating again, but once she asked me about weed and I didn't lie to her. I smoke weed, and I don't think it's such a bad thing, and if it is; less than alcohol, which is well coming in our world. But she don't think like this, she accept but i guess she don't want me to smoke it and uses it to increase her fear about we coming back together.

A few weeks ago, my father passed away from cancer at a somewhat early age. It was pretty sudden, and he left behind my sister and I, the rest of his close-knit family, and many friends.

I want to remember him in a way that he would enjoy. He specifically requested (years ago) that no large tree should be planted in his memory. However, he smoked roughly 3-4 ounces of weed a month and was incredibly (though secretly) passionate about it. After discussing it with my family (including my grandparents), we all decided that it would best serve him to name a strain of weed after him. This way, many smaller “trees” would be planted in his memory and in a manner that would best suit him.

As someone who knows nothing about the subject, how do I go about doing such a thing?

Edit: I should be more specific. I know nothing of botany and the sort. I would like to contact someone who deals with growing and related activites in order to name such a thing.",,False,self,t5_2rx97,1365711211.0,,,True,t3_1c54o1,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/1c54o1/naming_a_strain_in_memory_of_a_loved_one_xposted/,

- I picked up two varieties from my local collective; one of them looks like and is near the consistency of earwax - though decidedly greener. Handles like a dream. The other is much stickier, closer in consistency  to very thick tree sap. Does anyone have suggestions on separating a usable dab from the rest of the mass? Neither paperclip nor pocket knife have proven effective.

- I picked up an attachment for my water pipe at the local headshop, which was one of the cheaper and easier to use options there. at first blush it resembles a normal water pipe bowl, but it has a globular swelling midway along its length. Inside the bowl itself is some sort of charcoal-colored material that's light and pitted like pumice; it's this material onto which the concentrate is spread, then smoked (vaporized? not sure if anything is actually combusting).

Has anyone used a setup like this before? Any protips? Also, I'm really curious as to what the material in the bowl actually is. It rather resembles the heating stone in this old analog ""vaporizer"" I used to use.

For me it seems that this spiral gets pretty nasty after 6-8 bowls off of this piece. It looks like resin is building up pretty heavily in the glass spiral. I have even had chunks of resin release from the spiral and end up stuck to the glass in the second chamber. 


For cleaning in the past I had been using Forumula 420 which has been a good reliable and easy to use product, but it is pretty costly. So I recently switched to using ISO and table salt, which seems to work mostly as well at a fraction of the cost to me. 


But what I am wondering is if there is any thing that I can to to prevent this from getting dirty so fast in the first place. 


Lastly when the piece gets dirty like this it seems like the hits are much less potent when compared to it being clean. It's almost as if the resin build up is self perpetuating collecting resin faster as it goes. I also figure this resin is all the good stuff I am trying to get in me in the first place. 


So I ask the community does any one have any suggestions for me? (Local headshop owner suggested an ash catcher to resolve the issue, but I am hesitant to spend $50+/- to test this. The guy is smart and a nice guy but he does have an agenda to sell me things.)


Do tree style percs have this same issue? I had a PURP for about two days, but alas it got smashed to bits before it ever got dirty.

1336291197.0,8,self.asktrees,t9hd3,"Just got out of hospital, where they tell me I have CVS. Except aside from the pot angle, and the vomiting, I don't meet any other criteria I can see.",VoidVoice,10,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/t9hd3/just_got_out_of_hospital_where_they_tell_me_i/,"Monday morning, I woke about an hour early, my stomach roiling...quick sprint to the loo, empty the stomach, hop in the shower, and get ready for work. It's happened before....probably once a month, or maybe once every two, for a few years now. I've always attributed it to being an idiot and having those two slices of pizza right before bed.

Puke a couple of more times, and call in sick. Figuring it to be flu, or something similar (like excess pizza). Ride it out Tuesday, as I've deadlines that simply can't be missed. Tuesday evening, I'm done. Puked 6 times on my way home. I know what's coming.


About 4 times in the past year and a half, this has happened. I start puking, and cant' stop. Anything, even a mouthful of water, immediately wants back out. If I attempt to down a litre of water on my way to the loo (just to minimize dry heaves), I vomit about every 20 minutes. I can last about 6-8 hours like that, until I near pass out from exhaustion. Lasts around 5-8 days, depending on how quickly I get to the hospital. If I'm on it early, within a day or two of onset, and don't let them try to give me gravol to ride out my ""obvious stomach flu"" and send me home, it's usually about 4-5 days. Only once did I not go to the hospital during these long sessions, and it lasted nearly 10 days (I was travelling, and not able to stay at a hospital).


I've had numerous CT scans, more x-rays than I can count, this time I even had a gastroscopy.I've spoken with several GI specialists, and this time, and neurologist (as apparently repetative vomiting can come due to brain injury as well).

No results. Nothing. If I weren't puking in their faces, they'd tell me I'm the healthiest guy in the room.

Now, I'd not been secretive about my pot use. I was up front with them immediately upon going to Emergency, and have been every time. I'm not stupid. If there is a chance pot was doing it, they needed to know.

I'm a 45 year old male, who has been a daily smoker for 5 or so years,with a bit of a break before that (year?), then back to being a daily smoker for 10 or so before that.  Quantity? I'm a lightweight...though I do (did?) smoke daily, I'd make a quarter last a couple of weeks. Usually a one hitter after the kids went down, and maybe a couple of joints on a Friday night with the boys. No booze, no other drugs of any kind, at all.

This time, they seem convinced that I have CVS. Despite the fact that I am older than any currently researched patients (Oldest one I could find was 36). All research seemed to suggest that it typically struck those *much* younger...as in late teens, early twenties, up into the mid-thirties, but nothing more. (I fully realize that doesn't mean 35+ are immune).

The latest study I could find:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2982.2011.01791.x/full 

While I'm definitely close to the oldest subject in the study, the mean age (±SD) of CVS was 30 years (±11). So that person was an outlier, and not indicative of the norm *unless I'm totally off my statistics, which well may be, as it's been probably 20 years since I tried to apply it...)

The identied triggers...none of which apply to me;
...they may experience a prodrome, usually intense nausea and pallor sometimes heightened sensitivity to especially light but also smell, sound, pressure, and temperature with sometimes oncoming muscle pain and fatigue is reported by some patients. The majority of sufferers, but not all, can identify ""triggers"" that may precipitate an attack. The most common are various foods, infections (such as colds), menstruation, extreme physical exertion, lack of sleep, and psychological stresses both positive and negative.(none are true in my case...I awoke feeling like I'd better hit the sick bin, or I'll get the wife particularly mad by messing the sheets. I went to bed feeling fine, and in need of no more rest than any other day).

...During an attack a sufferer may be light sensitive (photophobic), sound sensitive (phonophobic), and, less frequently, temperature or pressure sensitive. Some sufferers also have a strong urge to bathe in warm or cold water (apparently, with the cannabiniod users, hot showers reduced symptoms...not me). Some sufferers reports that they experience a restless sensation or stinging pain along the spine, hands, and feet followed by weakness in both legs. (None of which apply to me. Aside from my body wanting to remove whatever it perceived was in my stomach, I felt just fine....well, aside from the ache of dry heaves for days...and any relief I felt at having a hot shower was simply due to removing the sweat of the hours of dry heaving.)

I don't have any of the tiredness, headaches, diarrhea, photo/phonophobia, abdominal pain, nor are any of the ""known"" triggers ones that impact me (within a timeframe relative to the event). I've not had any significant periods without eating (or fasting), no temperature extremes, lack of sleep, overexertion, allergies, ingesting certain foods or alcohol. 

Everything I read suggests CVS is more closely related to migraines than anything else. And I've never had a migraine in my life. I'd be hard pressed to remember a headache that warranted more than a couple of aspirin.

While I'll be the first to admit it's possible that pot plays into CVS just yet, I guess my question is do you think it is significant? Or is this just another 'angle' for the authorities to 'suggest' we don't partake? In my case, it sure feels like a cop-out diagnosis.  If it truly hit chronic users as they're suggesting, wouldn't the ""weed world"" have known about it for a very long time? I mean, I've been smoking for damned near 20 years now (35 if you count my teen/experimental years), and I've never run in to a single person who ever had this sort of thing. You'd think if I'd been hanging with large groups of chronic users, for decades, *some one* would have heard of this....even if it wasn't as ""CVS"", you know?

Don't get me wrong...I'm going to quit, at the very least for a year, to establish if it goes away. If it doesn't though, I'm gonna be pretty pissed at having to give up the one recreational drug I do use. If it's the pot, and CVS in a nearing 50 year old male who has smoked more than half his life is a truly viable thing, well...then life sucks.

Thoughts?

Apparently, they're doing drug tests now. I am a frequent smoker, and since I'm on winter break from school, I've been doing it regularly. Luckily, I'm very slender (about 5'11"" and 125 lbs), and I had four days off last week. However, since Monday, I've smoked at least twice a day, not including today. So far, I've started drinking tons of water, I bought some of those cranberry extract pills that are supposed to help, and I'm gonna start exercising daily. But, how screwed am I? Also, what am I missing to help detox?

On a legal note, since taking a DT was not part of my terms of employment, can they even do this? I also heard that they were only doing it to people that they suspect of doing drugs, and I'm not sure whether or not they suspect me. That's profiling, right? If they only select the people who they think use drugs? I just don't think that the way they're going about this is legally permissible.

I'm not sure when the test is, either. Let's assume I have a week or so.

Any help is greatly appreciated. I would really, really hate for this to be the way that my parents find out.

EDIT: Thanks to everyone who has submitted information, anything and everything that will help me not get fired is really fantastic. I knew I came to the right place for this.

Edit #2: Well, as it turns out, I don't have to take any drug tests. The company is only testing new employees or people who go to work and seem like they're on something.

I was hoping to exchange thoughts from others that have tried multiple strains.  Here's what I have:

LA OG - this is a low-yielding super-dank strain.  It tastes like Venom OG and a lot of the top-shelf strains I've had in CA.  It's an indica, but it grows super tall and is vine-y; 6-9 feet tall and flopping over.  I like to selectively remove leaves from plants, but this plant needs them in order to help keep it standing up, even with posts.

Skunk - This was a hand-me-down strain that doesn't really match up with other Skunk flavors I've had, but it's a robust bushy girl that has a good yield and gives you couch lock and possible day-naps.  It's the most tolerant as far as mistakes (burn over/under watering)

Trainwreck - Another hand-me down, this is my mildest strain that I use for day time medication.  I'm really not fond of this one, but it does taste decent.

I'm thinking about the following strains:

- Jack Herer - This is the only sativa that I think I've gotten a cerebral high from - but only once out of like 8 times.  I think I can unlock its potential.  Great taste.
- Northern Lights - I miss this strain, and haven't had it in a while.  Also tastes great.
- Ron Burgundy - probably the best tasting or most unique tasting weed I've ever had.  Killer color.  Impossible to find in seed form

So I recently got a job at a large insurance company. I was interning with them previously for the past couple of years during the summers. When I first got the job I did have to take a drug test (back before I smoked). I'm in college and graduating in May. When I was first offered the job the HR woman said I would need to take a drug test, I kinda freaked out, but then I called to schedule it and they said since I was employed with the company in the past 12 months I don't need one. 

Currently they are running a background check, I have a spotless record, nothing they're gonna see on there. My question/concern is, do you think they may have me do a drug test anyways? Also, do you think I'd loose the job over some pot? (I know it depends a lot on the company). As I'm writing this I realize how crazy I sound, I guess I'm just paranoid.

I've been having a bit of a problem with a one hitter I bought online recently. It's a straight through pipe, with a hole on constant diameter through the center. I've only ever owned a one hitter with a distinct ""bowl"" part, and I never got ash in my mouth with it. With this one it seems unavoidable.

I've found that using it with cupped hands (like a chillum) helps a bit, but the only real solution I've found is folding up a piece of wire (Don't worry, it's a material that won't react to the heat) and pushing it a little way down the shaft. that makes a kind of filter thing. But it gets clogged really quickly.
Basically, I'm wondering if there's any other way to use this frustrating little bastard.

He said that because it was water filtered it would be about 50% more efficient than using a straight pipe (which I don't really understand how it changes the efficiency).

He also told me that it was fumed with 24 carat gold. What does this mean? and is this realistically true? There is a gold shine to the glass but it doesn't seem reasonable to me that they would do that.

Another quick question while I'm at it, is there anything specific I should know about a bubbler vs. the straight pipe(non-water pipe) that I'm used to?

I smoked a lot, almost everyday. However, it got weirder and weirder. Pot has a really potent effect on me. At first, time would get extremely slow. This went on for my first month of smoking pot. Then I stopped getting that time slow effect, and instead it started getting more psychedelic.  I started seeing strange things (like a small dose of magic mushrooms. No visual hallucinations, but the world did look very different), having auditory hallucinations, and sound/color synesthesia. Of course, this might seem like a good thing. Well, that is if it didn't also make me super paranoid. At some point I was at a party, and smoked way more than I should have knowing my very low tolerance level (it's worth mentioning that I hadn't drunk any alcohol that day) and had this strange hallucination type of thing (like a fake memory interpreted as a vision of the future, if that makes any sense) and became convinced that something awful would soon happen which would leave me somehow paralyzed for the rest of my life. So I started panicking, and my friend came with me to walk me home. Well, I wouldn't even get out of the house. I was afraid there was a person with a gun wanting to kill me in every single car that drove by on the road. Also, when I smoke pot, I don't want to be around people. Usually I start being highly suspicious of them and thinking that everything I say or do is stupid and they must hate me for it. For this reason, I stopped smoking a few months ago. Problem is, I kind of miss it now. I really liked smoking pot when I was alone listening to music, because I would see all sorts of nice colors and hear the music like I'd never heard it before. However, now I'm not sure whether I want to start smoking again. I'm not sure whether it'd be healthy for me to do so. The thing is, my mother was psychotic, and I haven't always been completely sane myself, so I'm afraid pot could increase my chances of developing a severe mental illness. However, I feel drawn to it. I miss that feeling, and I'd like to start smoking again, at least occasionally. 
So, to summarize, here are my questions:

Would it be reasonable for me to go back to smoking pot, knowing that I have a family history of mental illness and it has such a strong effect on me (psychedelic trip, paranoia...)?
Do certain strands make you more paranoid than others?
What strand do you advise I smoke?
Has anyone else ever experienced such strong psychedelic effects from pot?
What about paranoia? Anyone experienced that? How do you deal with it?",,False,self,t5_2rx97,False,,,True,t3_s7wqx,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/s7wqx/paranoia_when_smoking_pot/,

&gt;you realize that there are billions of people on this planet
&gt;that a billion is a thousand millions
&gt;think about a million....
&gt;you will NEVER meet a million people in your whole life, even if every single day you met a hundred people. You will **never** meet MOST of the people in your STATE (let alone the world)
&gt;there are millions of bands, (billions of songs)
&gt;you will **never** hear **MOST** of the bands (let alone songs) that have ever existed, even if you listen to a new band every second for the rest of your life.  
&gt;There are millions of ACTORS/PLUMBER/BUTTFUCKERS/COUNTY CLERKS/YOUTUBE CELEBRITIES...
&gt;fill in the blank.. there are more (whatevers) than you could ever, ever know
&gt;YET
&gt;there is Albert Einstein


&gt;there is Winston Churchill


&gt;there is Martin Luther King


&gt;there is John Lennon


&gt;there is Jabba the Hut                                  :P



&gt;WHY do these stand out among the millions? among the literally MIND-numbing numbers of people? too many for any one person to count.
&gt;how do you stand out amongs LEIGIONS of people who are exactly like you (and often better)? 
&gt;maybe your whole life is meant to exist on a much smaller plane... a small community


EDIT: I crunched some of those numbers.... so *technically* if you lived to be 70 years old, and you met literally 100 people every day... you'd meet 2,555,000 people... but, realistically... I'm sure you, I and everyone will only meed WELL, well under 1 million people.

My understanding of vaporizers is that they heat up the weed to the point where the THC vaporizes, and that is what is being inhaled.

1328918178.0,5,self.asktrees,pk3kq,Have trees ever made you anxious? Longtime ENT on the verge of giving up.,anxiousontrees,6,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/pk3kq/have_trees_ever_made_you_anxious_longtime_ent_on/,"Throwaway account just to be safe.

The short (**TL;DR**) version: I've had a loving relationship with trees for about 5-6 years now. For the longest time I loved it SO MUCH. It made me creative and giggly and happy. A few months ago, trees started giving me moderate to severe anxiety and sometimes even full blown attacks. This'll be while I'm at a [1] or [2], barely even feeling anything. Being any higher on the scale than that makes it exponentially worse. Naturally, this has made me want to do it less and less, and now I'm at the point where I'm wondering if I'll ever love it again.

I'm not sure exactly what I'm asking you for, r/asktrees. I guess I wanna know, has anyone had any similar experiences? Can anyone link me to some research on the subject? Anyone successfully overcome this?

More details for those who want more:

- This is not paranoia. I used to get paranoid back in the early days of toking, but paranoia was always associated with specific thoughts I was having, like ""What if I get caught?"" This, by contrast, feels like a purely physical reaction. I've thought long and hard about how to best explain it to others, and this is the best I came up with: Have you ever had a friend jump out and scare you? The second you see your friend, you realize it's a practical joke and that you're perfectly safe, but you don't recover immediately--- your heart's still pounding, etc etc. Even if you only stay in this state for a few secs, you are at this moment physically panicking but mentally calm. 

- For anyone who wants to comment ""it's all your state of mind,"" see the above. I've had this happen while watching my favorite movie and feeling perfectly happy, laughing my ass off--- suddenly boom, anxious as fuck. Maybe it's subconscious, but it certainly seems disconnected from my conscious train of thought. 

- My bff seems to have the same thing happening to her. It started happening to us completely independently (we live in different states since a year ago, have totally different connections). We were talking on the phone one time and I brought it up and she goes ""me too!"" We had never talked about it before, so it's not like we subconsciously influenced each other to have this reaction or something. We started smoking around the same time 5-6 years ago. 

- Location has no effect. Strain has some effect, but not much. For whatever reason, smoking through a vap actually has the most effect-- it alleviates the problem greatly, generally speaking.

Here's the worst part, and the thing I'm most afraid of. If I have to give up trees over this, then ok, I'll be quite sad but whatever. The thing is, I've recently (and I believe unrelatedly) developed full blown anxiety/panic disorder. I'm pretty sure it started because of a physical illness I had, but there's a nagging part in the back of my mind that says, what if I did this to myself with trees? There's evidence against that because the whole tree-anxiety thing happened way before this disorder, and never carried over into my tree-free time. The other part of the evidence is I've had that physical illness before, and it's always caused anxiety/panic problems that go away as soon as the physical illness is cured. The only difference this time is that the physical illness was cured but the anxiety/panic has stuck around. I'm pretty sure said physical illness is and was the real cause, but I can't shake the doubt that trees had something to do with it.

Sorry this was so long-winded, r/asktrees. I wanted you to have all the deets you'd need. Please, please, if you can, help me get to the bottom of this thing.

She's also getting OLD, Reddit. She's starting to suffer from some pretty severe eye problems, she's complaining about her joints constantly hurting, and she has something wrong with her back, the name of which has currently escaped me. Possibly multiple sclerosis or something along those lines? 
She has absolutely no health insurance, so she refuses to go to the doctor to get anything prescribed for her pain, and even if she did, she more than likely wouldn't be able to afford it. 

So I figured since I'm buying the occasional gram anyway, I might as well share with her if it'll help. I just need to convince her to try it!

What ratio of herb to alcohol is best? I have about 6 grams of stems, should that affect my ratio?

What is the best temperature and duration to decarb? I have heard that cold decarbing is possible, can someone please explain this?

I have heard that steeping in the freezer is a good method because the trichomes freeze, become brittle and break off of the plant matter. Other sources say to keep it room temperature, some say warm. What method is better? How long should I steep for?

Is there a way to minimise chlorophyll taste? I am using Spirytus Polish alcohol because Everclear is not available where I live. I have read glycerine is better for taste but not as potent/concentrated.

So we didn't know what we were really doing, so we just grinded the bud a little bit, filled the bowl and pushed it down a little bit. Then we just held the flame over the bowl, inhaled and waited till it went out. Then we repeated till all the weed was smoked.

So I have a few questions:

* Is there a recommended way to light the bowl? Tilting the pipe and lighting, etc

* Any tips on packing?
* How to not heat up the metal where you toke from
* Disposing of ash and cleaning

My boyfriend and I are inexperienced weed smokers. I've only smoked twice before the incidence I will mention, and he had only smoked a handful of times before as well. Last weekend (Apr 5-7) I brought a gram of weed with me to his house and we smoked up. We had half of the gram altogether that weekend (so each of us probably smoked .25g of weed each). If it matters, it was done with a bong each time. We smoked once Friday night, once both Saturday morning and once that night, and a little bit Sunday morning. After we parted Sunday night, we each took half of the half gram that was left home with us.

From that point on my boyfriend has been experiencing a body high. Monday night it was still going on, and he smoked the rest of the weed, and the 'body high' was still there. His mind is completely sober, but his sense of touch is on the fritz. Everything feels weird to touch, and, in his words, feels 'long and drawn out' and 'slow'. Even the sun on his body feels weird. 

So my question: has anybody out there experienced this before? Normal? Something to worry about? When will it wear off?

More info: I smoked the same weed and, while I got plenty high, never had this symptom at all, high or sober. Neither of us are on any medications that would interact with the weed. Our dealer is plenty trustworthy, and I was there during the transaction, so I'm reasonably certain that it was not laced with anything. Also, no clue what strain of weed it is.

I tried asking these questions on a popular weed forum, but got 0 responses. I know Reddit in general/ ents in particular tend to be more helpful, so hopefully I get some answers. I just bought a brand new solid valve volcano and I'm loving it so far, but I do have a couple questions. 

First off, does the filling chamber have any way of attaching to the unit? I know the filling chamber for the easy valve has some clips to attach it securely, but as far as I can tell, you just have to set the solid valve's chamber on top and hope it doesn't fall. It's kinda heavy so it does stay for the most part, but I found that when in a room with a fan, I have to hold it in place or it will blow off. This doesn't seem quite right... am I doing something wrong?

Secondly, some vapor leaks from the slits in the plastic part attached to the bag ([Here's](http://imgur.com/388iV) a picture with arrows to be more clear what I'm talking about). It only does this when the bag is filling up, not when you are sucking the vapor out. Not a lot is escaping, but you'd think that when you pay almost 700 bucks for a vaporizer, it wouldn't leak.

So, if anyone could help me out with these questions, that would be splendid. Also let me know if you need any more info from me regarding my setup to answer the questions.

Thanks a lot!

-----------------------
EDIT: I emailed Storz-Bickel about this and this is what they had to say:

Attachment to the exhaust vent:

You are absolutely right, the solid valve only “sits” on the exhaust vent of the base unit. It is the weight that keeps the solid valve in place. The solid valve was the very first design of a valve system, our experience over the years has led to the development of the easy valve. Advantages of the easy valve are the clips, the filling chamber diameter and the reduced use of metal surface inside the valve system (&gt; less condensation). With the solid valve, balloon sizes can be custom made.
 
Vapor leakage: 

Usually you only have a little loss of vapor when the balloon is filled. Due to the overpressure in the balloon the vapor seeks the easiest way out; so vapor leaks though the slits of the valve.",,False,self,t5_2rx97,1339604109.0,,,True,t3_uy8sr,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/uy8sr/solid_valve_volcano_questions/,

So, my Entish companions...who has advice for this Edmontonian (Entmontonian?) on how to best re-introduce myself to the forest? 

I realize this is an awkward post...its why it's been so difficult for me to find any...""Hey, dude...who's your dealer?"" doesn't really work on the internets, eh?

Anyway, any advice on how/where to cultivate new sources of information around here would be most helpful.

As a toker and fellow ent, I share the same love for marijuana as all of you. About three months ago I had a bad acid trip that ended up in my friend going to the hospital and the other going to jail.

I ended up fine, just some PTSD, but last week after smoking a bowl I was exposed to crack cocaine smoke (I didn't partake but was in the room with friends) and it caused me to have a terrible panic attack.

Every time I have smoked since, I get crippling anxiety attacks. I didn't smoke for three days, then took a couple of hits and the anxiety came on like a tidal wave.

Smoking marijuana helps me with sleep, creativity, and even my soft bipolar disorder. I don't want to lose the benefits it gives me just because of anxiety!

Has this happened to anyone else; will I ever be able to smoke weed again? Do I just need to detox?",,False,self,t5_2rx97,False,,,True,t3_pz6pi,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/pz6pi/scared_i_wont_be_able_to_smoke_again_help/,

Is it worth it?",LemonMae,5,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/11r5br/so_i_wanna_make_some_cannabutter_is_it_worth_it/,"I've never tried making it before, &amp; I've never had the experience of eating an edible before. But, I'm tight on cash &amp; my lungs are starting to hate me for smoking, so I thought that using my weed for cannabutter to make some brownies might be a good idea. I've been told that the effects of edibles generally last much longer than when smoking, so I thought that it might also help me in the area of conserving as much bud as I could. 

So, here's my plan. I should have enough cash this weekend to afford a 1/4, &amp; I found a recipe for cannabutter that calls for a 1/4 &amp; one stick of butter. The idea is to use a double boiler (or just a small pot inside of a bigger pot, if you don't have one), boil water in the larger pot &amp; then place the butter into the smaller pot &amp; put the small pot into the water in the big pot so that the butter can melt. Then you get your finely ground weed &amp; start slowly mixing it into the melted butter. Then there's a conflict between how long you're supposed to let it simmer, I've seen anywhere from 45min to 12hours... Obviously I'm not going to leave it there for 12hours, so I was thinking maybe a 1.5hr or 2hr would be okay? Also, when it comes to straining it when it's finished, I haven't got any cheese cloth to use so I was planning on placing a coffee filter on the bottom of a pasta strainer. Would that work alright? &amp; then when it was all finished, I would just use all of it to make a batch of brownies that could hopefully last me a couple weeks (or more).

I know it seems &amp; sounds easy enough, but I'm just worried because if I do this, that 1/4 will be the only bud I'll be able to get for at least 2 weeks, if not longer. I really would like to try it, because I think that edibles would be a healthier way for me to enjoy my bud, while also being able to use as little of it as possible. I figure one brownie could last me a couple days, if I use the entire thing of cannabutter to make them... Don't you think? I'm just so worried that it won't work, &amp; it'll be some sort of disastrous experiment that will leave me terribly, horrifyingly sober for who knows how long. xDD

Just a few questions about bowls and downstems. I can't buy a bong because of lack of funds and would like a bowl/downstem for homemade pieces. I don't feel comfortable using a socket/pen tube.

* What are the bowl/downstem sizes for? (i.e. 8mm, 20mm, etc.)

* If the bowl/downstem sizes are different, can they still work together?

* What are the bong sizes for? Do I have to use the same bowl/downstem size of the bong? If so, what's the most standard/common size for bongs/bowls/downstems?

* How do bongs maintain airtight where the downstem and bong connect?

* Where is a good place to buy bowls and downstems cheaply on their own?

I guess this is a pointless question, since the bong I will buy in the future will come with a bowl/downstem anyway, but I am still interested.",,False,self,t5_2rx97,False,,,True,t3_x9r2j,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/x9r2j/questions_about_bowls_and_downstems/,

Do I need to acquire medical records before going in? Like if I don't have them am I going to be forced to walk out and come back later?

Will I have to wait or go through another process in order to walk into a dispensary and use the card?

The funny thing is that when I smoked the day before I go to the toilet like every half hour or so. Oddly enough, I can't really reproduce it consistently, as it is a bit different concerning intensity and how long it lasts each time.
Btw, I pretty much ruled out things like std or the like. I'm seriously thinking about quitting trees, you are my last resort.

Last week, I took niacin and drank a lot of water and cranberry juice. This weekend I was in my car a lot and had several normal days (no extra water or niacin) and then I took the at-home one. I'm sure it's not because of dilution (?).

I see a lot about how weight, metabolism, etc play a huge factor but time is the ultimate decider. I stopped this week and know I have a while to wait but I just want to be fully prepared. I am really worried that I wil not have enough time to clear my system before a drug test comes up. 
Some background about me: I'm 5'8 female 120 lbs. who has been smoking multiple times a day everyday for the past year (.5-1 gram/day usually). I have a fast metabolism and rarely workout (not sure if this works to my advantage in detoxing or not). If you need anymore info, just let me know. 

I guess my main questions are:

1) What can I personally do to speed up the process? (I already plan to not smoke, drink lots of water, work out daily and take more vitamins)

2) If I stick to a strict daily regimen of water, exercise, etc., how long do you predict until I could potentially pass a drug test? (I plan to test along the way with at-home kits) 

3) If I have little/no fat on me, could that potentially make it harder to burn out the THC? Could this also change the effectiveness of a detox drink? (I tried detox drinks, Qcarbo, a couple years ago and they NEVER worked but I also could have been using them wrong)

4) EXTRA CREDIT- Bud really helps me sleep and since I've stopped, getting to bed is not very easy. If any of you lovely ents have suggestions that may help me sleep during this break, I'd love to hear 'em!

It has always really bothered me that everywhere I go on the internet gives me different temperatures and time for cooking, thus I'm never sure Im doing it right. My gut tells me one of those two things (time/temp) are where we fucked up. Here is the process we used.

* GRIND-Shredded 4.1 grams trees in grinder, places on aluminum foil and added a sprinkle on an unmeasured amount of keif guesstimated at .4 grams.

* DECARB-Place foil on pan and into oven at 300 degrees F for 18 minutes (This is where I feel I may have made a boo boo. Last time we did this I used 222F for 10 mins and it worked fine, I had read though that higher temps under 350F do the job better and longer is better so I tried this.)
 
* OIL PREP- Heated 5 tablespoons of pure coconut oil in a frying pan and held it at aprox. 250F (Due to the use of a frying pan, the low amount of liquid, and a candy thermometer keeping temps, this may have been higher or lower at some times.)
 
* COOK-Mixed decarbed weed with oil and kept on heat stirring frequently for about 40 mins. 
 
* FREEZE-Drained oil through cheesecloth and placed liquid in freezer for 1 hour. Removed and took [picture](http://i.imgur.com/nr50m.jpg). Then divided into 4 parts and ate in various ways.

They found it disrespectful and illegal, and taboo. But they mentioned that all their current friends do it from time to time. They even encouraged me to only do it at friends houses.

Elated, I bought some from a friend and we vaped the night before. I was more concerned about the odor, so I tried harder to hide the bud. But I guess it was too smelly, because when I left home to go vape and hang out with a friend, I came home to my father saying that my door was removed and I could have it back ""maybe"".

I'm high right now and shaky, and a little sad that I'm ruining my relationship with my parents. Especially my mom, who has been a lot more agitated and short with me due to stress at work and going through menopause.

I'm willing to give it up, but I enjoy marijuana. Ever since I started smoking/vaping, I've become a better person. My temper has shortened, my confidence has increased, and I'm able to let things go, which is pheunomnal since I struggled with anxiety and coping skills for the past four years.

This little smelly plant has given me so much, but I'm afraid what it might take away.

i. If so, how true is it? Do we/can we relate on deeper levels that we aren't consciously aware of?  

5) How many times do you try and act smart - but then halfway through your thoughts you sound like a dumbass?

This has put me off marijuana a little bit.

Some of my friends claim that this could be because of the tobacco, seeing as I have zero problems with edibles. So while this could be true, I wanted to ask if a vaporizer should help, or if there is an efficient cheap way of baking all of my marijuana ( I never baked myself :( ). Seeing as I dislike smoking in general, I don't know if pure marijuana joints are the way to go.

So anyone a got good edible recipe, experience with my problem or experience with cheap vaporizers you can buy in Germany?

When I do contact them, how should I instigate the conversation/ask for an amount? I've also never gone to a deal alone. How should I prep myself for that? XD
I know it sounds noob-ish, but it's really the only part of the experience that I'm not comfortable with. ",,False,self,t5_2rx97,False,,,True,t3_ykaoy,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktrees/comments/ykaoy/how_should_i_interact_with_my_dealers/,

The other day I tried Vegas Titanium. Now, I'm not a huge pot smoker, and can't actually smoke weed as I have urine tests at work. So my friend brought over this free sample called Vegas Titanium. 

My friend who always smokes weed went first, and my friend and myself found it weird that he put down the bong after 2 hits, and was just laughing with red eyes. 
I was a little nervous, but thought what the hell, this looks like it might be fun (I had never actually been ""high"" before yesterday). 

I had a hit and coughed my lungs up, and within literally 10 seconds, I was feeling very light. I had to sit down, then just lost my perspective on everything. To the point I thought I was going to die. I had to beg my friend to take me to bed, and thought I was floating and seeing shit. It lasted 15 minutes, but it was the scariest 15 minutes of my life. 

My friend texted me about 2 hours ago, saying that he tried it again, and nearly got his friends GF the call the ambulance, as he thought he was going to die too haha!

Needles to say, it was a terrible experience for me, and am just curious if anyone else have tried it? 

Also, what are the chances of having a ""good"" trip if I were to try it again? 

I'm not sure if these are in the rules - but what synthetic (if you guys take smoke it) weed have you guys had good experiences with?
