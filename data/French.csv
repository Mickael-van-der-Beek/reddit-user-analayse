Voici une bonne vingtaine de façons de traduire ""that's funny"" en français! Comme je ne connais pas exactement tous les équivalents anglais, votre contribution est la bienvenue pour les traduire proprement, et en ajouter de nouveaux! Et comme je ne suis pas linguiste, natifs, n'hésitez pas à me corriger là où je me suis trompé!

----

c'est *drôle*: that's simply funny

c'est *rigolo*: that makes me laugh like a kid

c'est *marrant*: that makes me laugh, sometimes ironic (but never really insulting)

c'est *hilarant*: that makes me laugh even though I don't want to.

c'est *drôlatique*: that's something people would normally laugh to, but we're having a serious discussion (rare)

c'est *risible*: that's laughable (ridicule, often sarcastic)

*ça me fait marrer* / je me *marre*: that's laughable (often ironic, rarely sarcastic)

*ça m'éclate*: I'm having a ton of fun

*j'ai la rate qui se dilate*: that's a great and healthy laugh (kind of old)

ça *fait mal aux zygomatiques*: I'm laughing so much it hurts

""*Très drôle.*"": ""Very funny."" (almost always ironic when used alone. ""Très marrant."" and ""Très rigolo."" used on their own are almost never ironic, but rarely used with actual laughter)

je *ris jaune*: I pretend to laugh. That's not funny, that hurts.

ça me fait *rire nerveusement*: I'm laughing nervously

je *pouffe de rire*: I'm giggling

c'est *cocasse*: that's genuinely funny, but not to the point of laughing. As /u/JohnnyMcCool pointed out it often describes a *décalage*, a funny and unexpected contrast (eg: someone with hardcore facial tattoos, 190cm high and spike collar busy choosing a cute kitten in an animal shop would be *cocasse*).

c'est *poilant*: that's extremely funny 

je *me poile* : I'm laughing uncontrollably

ça *me défrise*: ""that's so funny even my hair is straightening""

*c'est énorme!*: that's extraordinarily funny (can be genuine or sarcastic depending on context and tone, but there's almost always a laugh involved)

*j'adore!*: I love it, so funny! (merci à /u/poupipou)

*très bon!*: objectively very funny!

*trop bon!*/*trop drôle!*/*trop marrant!*: too funny!

*t'as mangé un clown?* : I'm not laughing at your bad joke, I'm laughing at you ""did you eat a clown or something?"" (sarcastic)

*c'est une blague?* : is that a joke?

*je déconne*: I'm kidding (vulg)

je *me roule par terre de rire*: I'm rolling on the floor laughing (merci à /u/JohnnyMcCool) 

je suis *plié en deux*: I'm laughing so much my belly hurts

je suis *plié en quatre*: I'm laughing in foetal position

je suis *mort de rire*: I'm dying of laughing -&gt; ""mdr"" = ""lol"" (merci à /u/JohnnyMcCool)

je suis *pété de rire*: I'm laughing so much I'm breaking -&gt; ""ptdr"" = ""rofl""

---

/u/WongoTheSane nous suggère les expressions suivantes que j'intègre avec bonheur:

Il *rit aux éclats* : he roars with laughter

Il *éclate de rire* : he bursts into laughter

Il *rit sous cape* (cité par /u/CalvaireEtLutin [+3] ci-dessous) : he's snickering (merci à /u/Truthier pour la traduction)

Il *rit à gorge déployée* : he's laughing out really loud (this one is sometimes quoted as ""rire à gorge d'employé"" for comic effect)

*J'ai un fou-rire* : I'm having a fit of laughter

---

**Bonus**: on rencontre parfois en discutant sur le net ou les messageries les termes suivants: ils datent d'avant la démocratisation des smileys et autres MDR/PTDR. Notez que leur usage est tiré directement de la langue parlée, et qu'on les retrouve également dans certaines bandes dessinées.

haha: lol

HA HA HA: LOL

héhé: :P or ;) depending on context

hihi: kiddie or girly giggle

hin hin: that's not really funny (see ""rire jaune"")

hu hu: a posh or forced laugh, often sarcastic, rarely used

ho ho: rire du Père Noël (Santa Claus laugh), a condescending laugh

niark niark: Evil laugh, ""With my invention, I will become the master of the world, niark niark."" (merci à /u/CalvaireEtLutin)",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,1369407769.0,,L1,True,t3_1eyn4j,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1eyn4j/thats_funny_in_french/,

That's great! I think this community is super helpful and a great resource for people studying French, myself included. **However**, there is difference between asking for general feedback or asking a question about a specific structure, and asking a native speaker to correct all of the mistakes in an essay that has not yet been turned in. As a current TA for French classes, it makes me uneasy to see posters asking for those types of corrections, if they intend to pass off the writing as their own. Similarly, I've seen numerous posts along the lines of, ""So, I have to write an essay about X topic. What should I write about?"" Clearly, the purpose of these assignments is to get the student to think of their own ideas! 

I'm not necessarily proposing any sort of radical changes to this subreddit. I don't want to discourage people from asking for help, nor people from giving help. There is also no way to tell whether posters asking for help or correction are actually being dishonest.

But let's just try not to do anyone's homework for them. In the long run, we're not doing them any favors. Any other opinions on the matter?

I am not doing this anymore, sorry.

**IMPORTANT EDIT:**

The server is now off, I can restart it on demand.  Just PM me if you want. Anyway if you are alone, I'll give you my skype.  Ask for the server to be rebooted only if you are at least two.

-------------------------------------------------------------

**ORIGINAL POST:**

Following [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/h4fjm/hey_rfrench_are_you_interested_in_an_oral_chat/), which seem to be hidden from /r/French main page, I have decided to try the experiment again without hour determined. Skype is not a good choice in this case, so I decided to set up a Mumble server. (No warranty in long term)

Mumble is a teamspeak like, open source with a good sound quality. It works on a lot of platforms, and is easy to use. You can download it for free here: http://mumble.sourceforge.net/

The address of the mumble is kushou.tonbnc.fr on port 18000.

If you want to teach oral speaking in french, or practise your french, even if you're a beginner, don't be shy and join us !

I am curently on it with a friend of mine, yroeht, who is also a native speaker. We are waiting for you !

**EDIT:**

Ok so, I have been asked some questions, so I will add the answers here:

*When is this open ?*

For now, I will run the mumble server 24/7. You can see Mumble as a bar. There are rooms (tables) and people. The best way to know if there is someone to talk to is to come ! For now, there are only two rooms: AFK/BRB and Others (linked). Please go in ""French Speakers"" if you speak french fluently, in ""Need to practise"" otherwise. Everything said in any of those two channels is heard in the other, I have just made two channels to categorize people.

Now that this is told, I obviously have some needs, like sleep. I hope another fluent speaker will join mumble, but for now, I will do it with friends of mine, so I can't say there will always be a fluent speaker there.

*How can I connect to Mumble ?*

- Click ""Add a new server"", fill in the fields as follow:
 * Name = what you want, for example ""Reddit French"".
 * Address = kushou.tonbnc.fr
 * Port = 18000
 * Username = what you want.
- Click OK, now the server is favorited, double click on it to connect !
- Anwser yes to the security question when asked at first connection.

*I'm a beginner, can I speak ?*

YES, I obviously did it to permit people to speak with fluent speakers ! Don't be shy to ask me to repeat and speak slowly either ! You can also say things in english if you are lost/want to practise your comprehension skills only, but I may ask you to speak slower too !

*How does it work ?*

My method will be as following:

- First, presentations, we will introduce ourselves.
- Speak, speak and speak, without correction, until you are not afraid to speak.
- Then I will correct your mistakes to help you improve your French !

**Important:**

Please, it would be good if some other fluent speakers could join me ! I had like to change all those ""I"" in ""we"" !",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,1337548389.0,,,True,t3_h4rnz,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/h4rnz/hey_rfrench_do_you_want_to_speak_french_orally/,

Even if you can't understand 90% of what is being said, it's useful to hear hours and hours of french syllables.  And it's surprising what you can learn if you're forced to know a bit of the language to progress through the game.  If I see the same word over and over, I get an itch to look it up.  It's very hard at first, but gets easier.  I've only been studying for 9 months, and I can still get by in many games.

d) Misspelling of ""a lot"" as a single word, ""alot""

Don't take me wrong, I was thinking about linking those threads in the FAQ but same bits of information are spread across several threads. Furthermore, just the mention of the movie's title does not help one finding it as titles change on different markets.

So, let try to make this thread clear and suitable to post as a FAQ, keep it simple: 

* Name of the movie in French, IMDb, wiki or Allocine link, eventually some small comment. I think marking Action/Drama/SF/Year of making will be redundant.

* With the thread growing (hopefully) same movie will come to mind to several people, avoid reposting that title by checking does someone else hasn't already mentioned it (CNTR+F on a Win machine)

* For ease of perusing avoid unnecessary comments on participants' submissions, only indicate an eventual broken link/misspelled title.

I find that when we say ""excuse me"" in English, it is used to signal that you require someone's attention but with little or no admission of fault. For example, you can say ""excuse me"" to get a shopkeeper's attention when you know you're well within your rights to (it's his job), or to warn people blocking the sidewalk that you have to squeeze by, when really you have every right to pass.

One level up for me would be to say ""sorry."" I might say ""sorry"" to a shopkeeper if I want to get his attention and he's in the middle of something in order to acknowledge that I'm disturbing him, though clearly I don't actually regret it since I am still choosing to get his attention. I might also say ""sorry"" if I'm bumping past people on the sidewalk in an uncustomary way that I think is doable but that is just aggressive enough that I will look rude if I don't acknowledge that I didn't mean to shove them.

The top level for me would be to say, ""I'm sorry,"" or, ""I apologize."" To me, that means that I full on regret having wronged that person and that I would not have done what I did on purpose if I could have prevented it. It takes full responsibility for one's action as inexcusable. I might save this for if I accidentally ran into someone without seeing them and knocked them to the ground. For ""excuse me"" and ""sorry,"" I was signalling my intrusion as I was actually doing it, but for this one I am cleaning up after something that I genuinely regret.

So, do these differences exist in French? What are the connotations of ""pardon"" vs. ""excusez-moi"" vs. ""je m'excuse,"" etc.? By the way, I live in Quebec, so if anyone knows of a Quebec-specific aspect, please let me know!

Well, not really. In English, this would most likely mean that the speaker is giving a deep or meaningful speech. It's ""heavy"" in the sense that it rests heavy on the heart of the listener. The listener is deeply affected by the speech.

That's not what we mean in French, though!

""Sa diction est lourde"" means that his diction is bumbling and weird. It doesn't sound right! So, in this case, the best translation for *lourde* would be *clumsy*.

So here is my proposition, I post a link to a song and you try to transcribe it to me, no translation, just write down what you hear.

The song can be old or new, good or bad, I'll just try to keep it short and with clear lyrics.

You can PM me your transcript and when you get it right (or close) I'll give you another one, perhaps harder or longer if you feel up to the challenge. If you don't, I'll highlight the words you missed. You'll probably discover new words, just write down what you think you heard.

No cheating, that's not a contest, that's just for you and I don't feel like reading googled lyrics.

I was thinking that maybe it will be a good thing to share the link to every redditor who are learning french.

In French:

*« J’assignais la première place à la simplicité, dans l’ordre des mérites esthétiques et des grandeurs mondaines quand j’apercevais Mme Swann à pied, dans une polonaise de drap, sur la tête un petit toquet agrémenté d’une aile de lophophore, un bouquet de violettes au corsage, pressée, traversant l’allée des Acacias comme si ç’avait été seulement le chemin le plus court pour rentrer chez elle et répondant d’un clin d’œil aux messieurs en voiture qui, reconnaissant de loin sa silhouette, la saluaient et se disaient que personne n’avait autant de chic.* **Mais au lieu de la simplicité, c'est le faste que je mettais au plus haut rang, si, après que j'avais forcé Françoise, qui n'en pouvait plus et disait que les jambes "" lui rentraient "", à faire les cent pas pendant une heure, je voyais enfin, débouchant de l'allée qui vient de la Porte Dauphine - image pour moi d'un prestige royal, d'une arrivée souveraine telle qu'aucune reine véritable n'a pu m'en donner l'impression dans la suite, parce que j'avais de leur pouvoir une notion moins vague et plus expérimentale, - emportée par le vol de deux chevaux ardents, minces et contournés comme on en voit dans les dessins de Constantin Guys, portant établi sur son siège un énorme cocher fourré comme un cosaque, à côté d'un petit groom rappelant le « tigre  de feu Baudenord », je voyais - ou plutôt je sentais imprimer sa forme dans mon coeur par une nette et épuisante blessure - une incomparable victoria, à dessein un peu haute et laissant passer à travers son luxe « dernier cri » des allusions aux formes anciennes, au fond de laquelle reposait avec abandon Mme Swann, ses cheveux maintenant blonds avec une seule mèche grise ceints d'un mince bandeau de fleurs, le plus souvent des violettes, d'où descendaient de longs voiles, à la main une ombrelle mauve, aux lèvres un sourire ambigu où je ne voyais que la bienveillance d'une Majesté et où il y avait surtout la provocation de la cocotte, et qu'elle inclinait avec douceur sur les personnes qui la saluaient. »**

And in English:

*“I assigned the first place, in the order of aesthetic merit and of social grandeur, to simplicity, when I saw Mme. Swann on foot, in a ‘polonaise’ of plain cloth, a little toque on her head trimmed with a pheasant’s wing, a bunch of violets in her bosom, hastening along the Allée des Acacias as if it had been merely the shortest way back to her own house, and acknowledging with a rapid glance the courtesy of the gentlemen in carriages, who, recognising her figure at a distance, were raising their hats to her and saying to one another that there was never anyone so well turned out as she.* **But instead of simplicity it was to ostentation that I must assign the first place if, after I had compelled Françoise, who could hold out no longer, and complained that her legs were ‘giving’ beneath her, to stroll up and down with me for another hour, I saw at length, emerging from the Porte Dauphine, figuring for me a royal dignity, the passage of a sovereign, an impression such as no real Queen has ever since been able to give me, because my notion of their power has been less vague, and more founded upon experience—borne along by the flight of a pair of fiery horses, slender and shapely as one sees them in the drawings of Constantin Guys, carrying on its box an enormous coachman, furred like a cossack, and by his side a diminutive groom, like Toby, “the late Beaudenord’s tiger,” I saw—or rather I felt its outlines engraved upon my heart by a clean and killing stab—a matchless victoria, built rather high, and hinting, through the extreme modernity of its appointments, at the forms of an earlier day, deep down in which lay negligently back Mme. Swann, her hair, now quite pale with one grey lock, girt with a narrow band of flowers, usually violets, from which floated down long veils, a lilac parasol in her hand, on her lips an ambiguous smile in which I read only the benign condescension of Majesty, though it was pre-eminently the enticing smile of the courtesan, which she graciously bestowed upon the men who bowed to her.”**

I went through a messy divorce. He spends a lot of time with his Mom. She speaks 4 languages, and is most fluent in French. Further, she is starting Teacher's College to teach in the French school system. So, I kinda figured reading out loud in French would quickly become a non-issue. I was wrong. It is getting worse. Time for me to act.

I am not sure how to do this, given I don't know French. Can anyone suggest a solution? I am sure there are a ton of online course/programs, but I think I need some solution that is one-on-one tutoring - although that could be online too.

Since the key to learning any language is in it's regular application, and since the French Reddit Skype groups are often fragile and fleeting, I propose we form a French speaking community based around a FREE TO PLAY MMO like LOTRO or Guild Wars (which I believe are the consensus favorites?) where a small group of like-minded beginners could meet up everyday and get their French on.

WHY AN MMO? Simple: If we hold true to the French speaking cause while in game it would offer an unparalleled sense of immersion into a French speaking world, forcing our small community to not only speak and write in French, but do so in real time. It's the same idea as the Reddit organized Skype meet ups but with the added structure and focus of a game world. Conversation topics would arise not only from traditional every day topics, but from battle stories, loot requests, co-operative tasks, etc., offering a potentially more diverse/stimulating range of subject matter. And I can see a community based on an MMO, which is designed specifically to sustain interest, surviving longer than one based on a Skype community. Most of all, it would make learning French FUN (probably)!! 

BUT I DON'T LIKE MMOs: No problem. The MMO isn't the point. In fact, you don't even have to play. There's no reason why you can't just create a character, show up, and shoot the shit with people. Conversations are often the only way to endure the monotonous parts of games like these anyway, and I'm sure anyone stuck on a fetch quest would be glad to have a conversational distraction. Think of the game as a supplement for the social component: THE POINT OF THIS EXPERIMENT IS NOT THE GAME ITSELF, BUT RATHER TO OFFER A CONSISTENT &amp; ENGAGING AVENUE FOR YOUR FRENCH STUDIES.

BUT MY CONVERSATIONAL FRENCH ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR SOMETHING LIKES THIS: No problem. Even if your french is prohibitively awful, you can still participate in the game world. Spend enough time with us and you'll begin to fill in your conversational blind spots- sooner or latter you'll be gradually easing yourself into the chats. This means that there is (almost) NO SKILL LEVEL REQUIREMENT. As long as we all agree to speak French, and only French, it should still be a productive exercise. Also, hobbits.

If you'd be interested in something like this, please note your preferred FREE TO PLAY mmo in the comments section as well as any suggestions/improvements you have for the community/experiment. The most popular game will be what we play. I'll start: LOTRO!

She speaks very quickly and it's embarrassing how little of what she's saying I actually understand. I hear longer words and understand them at once, but something like ""il dort"" doesn't register as anything other than a collection of sounds.

It's great because if you're unfamiliar with an important word, you can click to get it's Wikipedia page. There, you can probably work out what it is from the text, and if not, there'll probably be a picture of it.

It also teaches you words you're not likely to encounter in a language lesson. For example, I learned the words for ""songwriter"" and ""rhythm guitarist"", among others, just by reading The Beatles article.

It also helps to have Google Translate open in another tab, so you can translate sentences you don't fully understand. Or even just to check if you understood what you read properly.

I've only started doing this today, but I've already learned a lot more than I would in an online lesson. It's also very enjoyable.

A friend suggested this was an area I could afford to focus on, in order to improve my French.  I went and searched for articles concerning this, and found two good ones on the same site, which list a bunch of these verb + preposition pairings.

[The article on verb + de](http://www.frenchtoday.com/blog/why-french-verbs-followed-preposition-de-infinitive)

[The article on verb + à](http://www.frenchtoday.com/blog/why-french-verbs-followed-preposition-a-infinitive)

My question relates to ones which appear on both lists, for example continuer à/de, demander à/de, etc.  Can you please explain to me the difference between the two?  For this explicit case, the article translates the ""continuer de faire quelque chose"" example to mean ""to *keep* doing something"" implying a present continuation, whereas the ""continuer à faire quelque chose"" example is translated to simply mean to continue doing something.  Subtle, but a difference.

Anyway, I've tried looking around and have not found anything specific.  If you could kindly clarify the difference between the two examples, I would appreciate it very much.

Thank you! 

EDIT:  To supplement my post, I found [this article on Ask.com on this subject](http://french.about.com/cs/grammar/a/verbswithprep.htm).  According to it, it would appear that à/de are interchangeable after ""continuer,"" although I don't believe this is true, as my French teacher corrected me today, for using ""de.""

And yet I really don't feel like I've improved past an intermediate level for a very long time.  On a regular basis I still need to ask people to repeat themselves, I still encounter unfamiliar vocabulary, I still get tongue-tied trying to express myself, I still need most puns explained, my accent is still quite strong; bref, I feel like I'm stuck on a plateau which is still a thousand miles away from the fluency I have in English and I want to close the gap.

So what have others done in similar situations to break through to the next level, from intermediate to advanced?  Are there courses that can help, or is it just a matter of finding more difficult material?  What do people studying French in universities get advised to do? Any suggestions would be welcome!

**TL;DR:** I have a decent level of French but I don't feel as if I have improved for the last year or so.  What do you suggest I do to improve?",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,False,,L2,True,t3_15bpjc,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/15bpjc/stuck_trying_to_improve_from_intermediate_to/,

Even on iwantout, I keep hearing people talk about how they feel like the French populace is rude, unfriendly, and scoffs at foreigners.

Perhaps it's my personality, or my upbringing, or the fact that I live in Chicago, but I never experienced anything close to this. People were far more considerate than in my experience anywhere else (except Canada...) Nobody ever scoffed at me for speaking French. Nobody ever replied to my French with English - with one exception, in a cave, where my French vocabulary didn't quite extend deeply enough into wine lingo. The only thing close to a ""scoff"" that I ever got was when I unthinkingly ordered ""un crème brulée"" in a restaurant, and even then, the waiter repeated my mistake before correcting himself and we all had a laugh. 

A couple of times, I went out with relatively large groups of Americans and was the only French speaker there. Everybody was still nice and friendly, and there were quite a few entertaining conversations where French people tried their best to figure out what it was this loud group of Americans wanted.

In Angers, when people found out I was going to Paris, they warned me about how rude Parisians were. In all honestly, they were still nicer than Chicagoans. At several points, I stopped random people on the street trying to get directions someplace, only to find out that the place was right around the corner. Nobody was ever rude or condescending. A couple of times, I ended up with a whole crowd of people as impromptu groups of Parisians argued over what the best way to get to my next destination was.

I provided a few examples in which I heard this phenomenon.

After a bit more searching, I discovered some analysis on this trend. [This](https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/zsfagyal/shared/ICPhS99Fagy_Mois.pdf) is an analysis on the devoicing of final vowels in French. I find it very interesting.

Also, I found [this](http://venus.unive.it/canipa/pdf/HPr_04_French_fr.pdf) one in French (read pg. 6, 4.1.2.3) and again in [English](http://venus.unive.it/canipa/pdf/HPr_04_French.pdf) (pg. 156, 4.1.2.3).

So, I have found evidence of this trait. /r/French, what can you tell me about it? I haven't been able to find if this is particular to Parisian French or what, so I really want to know.

I had French in school for a year and Duolingo kind of got me interested in learning French.

So I did a bunch of units in Duolingo but at some point, it was more of a guessing game and I just couldn't remember all the stuff properly.

Well, I lost interest. But now I got back into it but instead of using Duolingo, I bought myself a book. I've just finished the second unit and I already feel like I know more about the language than with Duolingo. It just seems to be more detailed about grammar, pronunciation and actual usage of the language in conversations. Does Duolingo actually introduce you to the concept of formal addressing? If I remember correctly, they just accept the ""vous"" and the ""tu"" form as a proper translation. 

The audio that comes with this book is recorded by native speakers. I didn't think that the Duolingo audio was bad or something. The German one did sound much more robotic. But now that I actually hear native speakers speak (as fast as you'd hear it in a normal conversation and much slower) it's obvious that the Duolingo stuff is not exactly natural.

So, has somebody had more experience with Duolingo or has one of your natives taken a look at it? Can it replace a proper book by a reputable publisher and author, is it just a nice addition or is it just a giant waste of time?

Thanks for reading.

Also, if a native German speaker is looking for a good book, I bought Französisch mit System published by Langenscheidt (those are the one that make those dictionaries every school uses) and I'm quite happy with it. It's like the English books you should know from school just, you know, not written to provide a year of exercises.

I read on a [random blog](http://blog.notanendive.org/post/2008/10/04/why-the-french-don-t-speak-any-other-language): 

&gt; Any French person who's studied as far as the baccalaureate has had at least 7 years of classes in a foreign language and possibly 2 to 5 years in another. ... The French educational system introduces the first foreign language (première langue vivante) at the beginning of the secondary cycle (classe de sixième - around 11/12 years old). The first language learned is English 92%, followed by German, 7.5%. A second language is then introduced two years later (classe de quatrième - 13/14 years old). 

So do most French people speak a fairly competent level of English, given most have studied it for seven years? Are there many people who don’t speak a word? And is there much regional variation? I've read that people in Paris speak better English, but I'm not sure if that just applies to people who work in tourism.

Bonus question: Would you be in favour of greater emphasis being put on English learning, with compulsory learning at an early age, less TV and movie dubbing, etc., like in the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries? 

Also, how is English taught in Quebec? Are most Québécois bilingual?

While this helps people tremendously when they need to be able to communicate in France, it doesn't really teach you the language from the ground up. I have taken a year of French class (high school), but due to certain circumstances, the teacher was only able to teach part of the year's worth of material. 

We have learned:

* The colors of the rainbow
* The days and months, and how to say what time it is and what day it is
* The conjugations of `être` and `avoir`, in the present tense 

I would like to be able to learn over the summer what I have missed. I will be taking another year of French next year, but the teacher is very lazy and would much rather put on popular Disney movies in French than teach a lesson.

Therefore I am looking for something I can do over the summer and over the year to supplement the class (which does not have a textbook). I have added some popular verbs and their conjugations (taken from [this page](http://french.about.com/od/grammar/a/topverbs.htm)) into my Anki deck, and I will be adding some other vocabulary as well, but I am also in need of a textbook to help me with grammar. I still have a lot of very basic questions, like `""How do I ask a question in French? Do I just look in a dictionary for the words 'who' 'what' 'where' 'why' 'when' 'how' and form the sentence as I would if I were making a statement?""` and `""Why is it that sometimes a pronoun like 'je' or 'vous' is after a verb instead of before?""` and some kind of textbook or other resource would help tremendously.

For example when you ask ""**What are you doing**"" would be ""**Qu'est-ce que tu fait?**""
               When you ask ""**What is that ?**"" it would be ""**Qu'est-ce que c'est que ça** ?

But when you ask ""**Did you do the homework**"" it would rather be "" **Tu as  fait les devoirs**?

Also,  for you Androidians, my friend Google told me that it IS available on Android as well!",SlightlyAmused,22,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/10dwq4/i_discovered_an_iphone_game_thats_turning_out_to/,"**The TL;DR, since this ended up being way TL because I got carried away somehow:** 
So, you're perhaps familiar with the game Boggle, also known as Scramble with Friends these days, I suppose. Well that's exactly what [Ruzzle is](http://www.rumble-app.com/) (link to the website, where you'll find both the iTunes and Android links. You can't miss 'em), except you can pick the language you want to play in, and i must say, their language selection seems pretty extensive. So I've been playing in French lately and, you know, I'm having a pretty good time! And I don't even like board-game-type games, usually. 

**TL;DR of the above TL;DR: Make French practice fun by playing *Boggle en Francais. Link is in above TL;DR.**

Heres the deal: French words have so many options when it comes to endings. I mean whoa. BUT this means there are many opportunities for hitting jackpots in *Boggle en Français*. Say you find *laisser* but oh shit! there's another 'e' and an 's' within reach, and BAM, you suddenly have four words:  *laisse*, *laisses*, *laissées*, and *laissée*. There's likely an 'a' around too so you now have *laissa* and maybe even *laissas*. You'll feel optimistic at this point so you'll likely end up trying *laissae* because there are so many options that trying any and all 'a,e,i' ending combinations is a good strategy when you're pressed for time. 'i's or 't's? Even bigger win, not to mention the many other words and verbs you can make out of *laisser*, like *lisser* et *lasser*. And before you know it, you've racked up like a million points but your opponent is probably not far behind (or ahead). Then you end up getting a round where there are very few vowels, and its like your entire knowledge of French evaporated in that moment. So you try crazy combinations of letters as fast as possible while trying not to get distracted by some of the truly odd words that end up being legit, like *pschitts* (defined as the sound made when opening a carbonated beverage bottle, plural) or *schwas* (from what i gathered, it's a technical grammar term that involves neutral vowels, again plural) or *brocs* (plural - ya gotta go for those *s* 's - term for pitcher, the beverage container kind).

  
  As you can see, gameplay gets pretty intense. 


    If you're a beginner, don't even sweat it... Try it anyway. Case in point, my lovely non-French speaking manfriend managed to beat my lifelong-bilingual-who-grew-up-speaking-French-at-home self. On more than one, even two occasions, that sonofabitch. On the other hand, I beat my 100%-born-and-raised-in-France- French mother every time (she just got the game the other day, though). Or maybe my family is just genetically bad at *Boggle en Français*, I don't know... 

Basically it's set up like your standard multiplayer word game: you can play with friends or if your friends suck (at) or don't play Boggle, much less *en Français,*  you can play with random strangers, which I've done many a time and never had an issue. Om the contrary, its been pretty even as far as skill level and I haven't encountered anyone that was annoyingly good or annoyingly bad. 


  Another thing is, you can have one game in English, one game en Français, and another game en español going *all at once* if you wish! *Note: I don't recommend doing this, because the brain gets pretty confused and achy due the constant switching of language gears over such a short period of time, but hey, whatever butters your biscuit!

The app is FREE, unless you want to play the individual practice games where it's just you against the timer. I think it was a buck or two for the full version. I decided I could use the solo practice after losing to a non-French speaker, though you might be perfectly happy with just the head-to-head competition. 

Anyway, I sound like a goddamn commercial right now, and for that, I am sincerely sorry because I don't like those instances where I find myself wondering if I'm getting subtly bamboozled by sneaky marketers or if its legit, but I do solemnly swear [on my painfully cute kitten](http://i.imgur.com/xXICS.jpg) that I don't work for or know or am in any way connected with these Ruzzle folk nor do I know anyone who might be. It's just that I frequently see posts around these parts from people seeking different, perhaps more entertaining or engaging ways of learning/practicing french, and I figured it might be helpful to some among this lovely bunch of French learners/speakers/observers wanting to spice things up a bit... 


*So there ya have it, mes amis! I can't believe you read my ramblings all the way down to here, but its much appreciated on my end! I don't know how the hell I managed to turn a measly recommendation into this saga, but alas, I don't have the motivation to go back and make it shorter. So sorry you guys...*

1258999707.0,16,self.French,a7cw8,[Intermediate] Avoid these 10 very common anglophone false cognates (faux amis).,zakool21,17,1,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/a7cw8/intermediate_avoid_these_10_very_common/,"If you're commonly writing/speaking French and don't like having to stop to consult a dictionary, you should be aware of these false cognates (faux amis). False cognates are words that are usually spelled the same or look very similar in both languages, but mean completely different things.

1: *Actuellement* vs. Actually: This is a false cognate that also holds true in Spanish (Spanish equivalent: *Actualmente*) and is often mistranslated. In French, it means ""currently,"" as does *Actualmente* in Spanish. To say ""Actually"" in French, use *à vrai dire*, *vraiment dit*, or *en fait*.

2: *Collège* vs. College: Just as in many countries outside of the US where ""College"" refers to something other than university, *Collège* in French refers to high school or can refer to trade school. The way that Americans use ""College"" translates best to *Université* in French.

3: *Déception* vs Deception: They look very similar, huh? *Une déception* is actually ""a disappointment"" in French. You can say *J'étais vraiment déçu* and that means ""I was really disappointed."" To say that you were deceived by someone in French: *Quelqu'un m'a trompé.* Be careful though, because if you say *Je me suis trompé,* it means ""I was mistaken"" or ""I was wrong.""

4: *Envie* vs. Envy: *J'ai envie de faire qq.ch* means ""I would like to do something (in the future)."" Clearly not the same thing as envy. The verb *Envier,* however, *does* mean to envy somebody/something. It's a subtle but important distinction.

5: *Opportunité* vs. Opportunity: *Opportunité* generally refers to an opportunity to be seized, like in a business deal. It also can mean ""appropriateness."" To say ""opportunity"" in French, you want to use *occasion.* For example, ""J'avais l'occasion de rendre visite à mon ami, mais je l'avais laisser tomber"" translates to ""I'd had the chance to visit my friend, but I let it slip away.""

6: *Chance* vs Chance: *Chance* in French generally means ""luck"" rather than ""chance."" If you are wishing someone good luck, say *bonne chance!* If you want to say that you had the chance or the opportunity to do something, see the prior entry, #5.


7: *Type* vs. Type: *Type* in French refers to a personality type or a genre of person, as in ""She wasn't my type of girl."" Type, the way it's most commonly used in English, is translated best by using *Genre* or *Sorte*.

8: *Monnaie* vs Money: *Monnaie* refers to loose change and coins. To say ""money"" in French you would preferably use ""Argent."" The slang word for ""cash"" is *fric,* not to be confused with *flic* which is the slang word for the police.

9: Caractère vs Character: *Caractère* most closely means temperament and is used to describe someone's personality. A character in a book or a movie is most commonly stated as *personnage.*

10: *Attention* vs. Attention: *Attention* in French means ""caution."" If you are referring to attention, as in the case of needing someone's attention, use *écouter* which is to listen, or *faire attention,* which is slightly less dramatic than *attention* itself.",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,True,,L2,True,t3_a7cw8,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/a7cw8/intermediate_avoid_these_10_very_common/,

I don't care much, at this point, about having a strong American accent when I speak French, I just want to focus on being understood.  In Spanish I couldn't pronounce the ""rr"" sound, but it never hindered being understood and I was even told that it was ""cute"" on multiple occasions, so it wasn't a priority.

Mispronouncing ""u"" on the other hand completely changes the meaning, and with ""bulle"" in particular makes it sound as if I'm talking about testicles and it's quite embarrassing.  My French coworkers respond by laughing and going ""non non non, tu veux dire 'bulle' pas 'boule'!"" and then just keep repeating 'bulle' over and over again like my old schoolteachers while I flounder with my pesky diphthongs.

* Pour comprendre mieux la structure des phrases françaises, j'utilisais la structure français quand je parlais en anglais: *What is this that you want to do? (Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire?)* *What want you to do? (Que veux-tu faire?)* Ça aide à composer des phrases plus compliquées.
* Je ne traduis jamais en ma langue maternelle quand je lis.
* Je lis toujours ~~toute haute~~ à haute voix.
* Je dis en français tout ce que je dis en anglais (quand mon vocabulaire suffit). 
* Je note les idiomes que j'utilise et recherche leurs équivalents français. 
* Quand je regarde des films et des émissions doublés, j'imagine que je peux lire ce qu'ils disent. Parfois, je peux voir les mots écrit dans ma tête! Même les mots que je n'avais jamais appris!

Quelques autres idées:

* Faites des examens rapides pour reconnaître immédiatement les très petits mots essentiels comme *je, le, ne, te, me, se, ce, que, y, en,* etc.

Which of the following (or perhaps others) French language lesson podcasts is your favorite? I am currently subscribed to three (seeing from my Google Reader):

* [The FrenchPodClass by Frenchie Productions](http://www.frenchpodcast.com/) - (site seems down at the moment), daily, sometimes with video vocabulary every few days
* [Podcast français facile by Vincent Durrenberger](http://www.podcastfrancaisfacile.com/), update every few days, with free transcript and about 50% of the topic about grammar
* [DailyFrenchPod](http://www.dailyfrenchpod.com), daily, transcript not free (?), 7-day trial

I admit I have been way behind with all these, but have recently picked up pace again (due to having recently purchased a new MP3 player, yay). I used to listen to DailyFrenchPod, but now my current favorite is Podcast français facile by Vincent.

Verbs which take an indirect complement with the preposition ""à"" can, when the complement is a pronoun, either retain the preposition (""à moi"", ""à toi"", ""à lui"", ""à elle"", ""à nous"", etc.) or use an oblique form of the pronoun (""me"", ""te"", ""lui"" \[instead of ""le""\], ""lui"" \[instead of ""la""\], ""nous"", etc.):

* ""Je parle à mon amie"" → ""Je lui parle"" (""Je te parle"", ""Je vous parle"", etc.)

* ""Je pense à mon amie"" → ""Je pense à elle"" (""Je pense à toi"", ""Je pense à vous"", etc.)

Among verbs which take no *direct* object, some verbs in the first category are: parler (""je leur ai parlé""), obéir (""je leur ai obéi""), nuire (""je leur ai nui""), téléphoner (""je leur ai téléphoné""); some in the second category are: penser (""j'ai pensé à eux""), songer (""j'ai songé à eux""), rêvé (""j'ai rêvé à eux"", although ""j'ai rêvé d'eux"" is probably more common), renoncé (""j'ai renoncé à eux"").

Verbs which *also* take a direct object are in the first category (""je lui donne un cadeau"", ""je lui demande son nom"", ""je lui propose un rendez-vous""), except when the direct object is the pronoun ""me"", ""te"", ""se"", ""nous"" or ""vous"" then the second construction is used: ""je me donne à lui"", ""je te donne à lui"", ""elle se donne à lui"", contrast with ""elle le lui donne"".  There are, still, some verbs taking a direct object and still always use the second construction, but it seems that they can always be analysed as a locative complement of some kind: ""il tire toujours la couverture à lui"" (≃""...vers lui""), ""il ramène tout à lui"" (≃""...vers lui"").

The Lernwörterbuch wasn't useful for practical situations because it was slow to use (for me) and because it only covered basic vocabulary (around 5,000 words, if I remember correctly, or maybe a few thousand more) but when I had time to waste, I enjoyed relying on it as a challenge.  I have fond memories of looking up a definition, needing to look up words in that definition, looking up words in the definitions of the words in the definition, and having to refer back to the book I was reading to remind myself of what word I was originally trying to figure out.

I could do that with a native dictionary, too, but the nice thing about the Lernwörterbuch was that it was limited to common meanings of common words, so I knew that any new vocabulary I encountered in it was worth writing down and learning.  I didn't have to worry that I was off in the weeds learning obscure words or meanings.  

I would love to find something similar for French.  Dead tree, app, or web site would all be equally appreciated.

A linguistic examination. ,TuckerTheCat,25,11,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/pmmwr/are_french_people_not_awkward_a_linguistic/,"In colloquial American English, we use the word ""awkward"" to describe individuals that often lack social grace, poise, or who create situations that cause others to feel discomfort or embarrassment for them. Think of the everyday phrases we use: ""Well that was awkward."", ""He is so awkward."", ""There was the most awkward silence after she said that.""

I studied French for 11 years and lived in France for 4 months. I am convinced that French people are not awkward in the way we understand the word, simply because, there is no word in French for awkward (the closest, I believe, is *maladroit*, which really only describes physical clumsiness or awkwardness, e.g., the maladroit teenager who has not grown into his body yet.) 

Language defines things into existence. By not having an equivalent for awkward, native French-speakers cannot be awkward, at least through their perspective (certainly, an American might notice an awkward interaction or individual while in France, but the French could not perceive it as such). In contemporary American culture, the word ""awkward"" has many connotations, and in a sense it encompasses a wide range of behaviors - both positive and negative - that allow people to describe about others or themselves. 

To quote my French friend who lived in America for a year: ""Awkward is such a great word. Probably my favorite English word. It's a shame that we don't have an equivalent in French... alas, French people are not awkward.""

I have taken a year of French and I will start another year soon but in the meantime I have decided to try to practice on my time off, but the two problems I'm having is thus:

It seems that the 'r' is pronounced differently (i.e. with more emphasis) depending on where in the word and/or sentence it is used. Sometimes you can really hear it in the back of the speaker's throat, and other times it sounds almost like an English 'r'. Is there a rule behind this or is it something I just have to get a feel for?

Also I have been reading for tips on how to pronounce the 'r' (including a few comments on the threads that have been posted in the last few days here on /r/French) but what I'm noticing is that when I do it, it's easier for me to do in some words but not others. I can seem to do it okay in 'couleur' but not at all 'orange'. 

Another concern I'm having is that after only two or three minutes of practicing words with 'r' in it, my throat starts to hurt pretty badly, like I have been singing really off-key, so I am concerned that I am just not doing it correctly at all in spite of the advice I have read.

I'm assuming the service is free because most of their market is in the US. Part of their package includes being able to speak with native speakers so they've opened it up to everyone.

The downside is that there are still not a lot of users (I'm going to re-post in a couple of more language learning subreddits because I think many can profit from this tool). I'm using Spanish - there's usually always an opportunity to find a native speaker learning English. I logged on past 6PM CST yesterday and didn't find any native French speakers on but perhaps when they're not sleeping, you can find some there? I'm hoping more join. 

The way the games work is that you do the first 4-6min session (or for however long you want to chat) in one language, then the other one in Spanish or the target language.

The site recommends you be at conversation level and won't let you check ""beginner"" for you language level (I'm guessing this is so they can get you to buy their product and learn) but as long as you're comfortable holding a simple conversation or talk about a simple topic prompted by the program, you will be fine.

Also, you can speak with other users learning French.

I'm in Paris now, and I must confess that I **love** slang, no matter what the language is (my native tongue is English.) 

For example, money in America is green. And since it's green, you can also refer to it as other things that are green: salad, lettuce, etc. Thus, there is almost an unlimited number of things you can refer to as money, and it's up to other people to figure out what you're referring to.

Or it's like cockney slang: you start with a phrase, Barney Rubble (from Flintstones), shorten it (to Rubble), and make it rhyme (Trouble). Thus, a bit of barney = trouble. I can't get enough of stuff like that. It's like a really fun game that everyone plays, and when someone uses a unique, perfect-for-the-situation word or phrase some time, there a few that I enjoy more.

I saw the list of French slang words on reddit before, but I would like something a little more guided, from a real french person. I'm particularly interested in verlan, because I love words with games. I know the following:

trainer - hang out, meuf = femme, canont = hot (like for a girl), ça dechirent = that's awesome, fric - cash, flic - police, pompes - sneakers, relou - annoying I think?

And some others, but I'm not just gonna start listing all the words I know. Again, any words that are actually used by les jeunes françaises would be best. Thanks a lot!

Here it is: 

Quand j'ai étudié à Montpellier au printemps dernier, je suis devenue familiarisée avec tous les niveaux du système scolaire français—de l'école maternelle à l'université.  J'ai fait un bénévolat à l'Ecole maternelle Paul Eluard comme une assistante d'anglais.  Au collège local, ma mère d'accueil était un professeur de littérature dévouée.  Les étudiants de mon université ont participé à des activités culturelles et académiques avec des écoles intermédiaires et secondaires en Montpellier.  J'ai aussi suivi des cours à l'Université Paul Valéry, me donnant une perspective sur la préparation nécessaire pour les études supérieur en France.  J’ai commencé à comprendre comment les Français abordent l'éducation et à envisager une place dans ce système pour moi.


Etudier en France a été une expérience enrichissante à bien des égards, mais enseigner l'anglais aux élèves de maternelle était une des meilleures choses que j'y ai faites.  Le mardi, j'ai passé la matinée avec un groupe d’élèves qui avaient 3-4 ans.  Je les ai aidés avec leur travail du matin, je suis allée au gymnase et j’ai joué dans la cour de récréation avec eux.  Plus important encore, je leur ai appris leurs premiers mots d'anglais !  J’ai eu l’indépendance totale pour concevoir mes propres activités.  Ces enfants étaient un vrai plaisir à enseigner !  Je me sentais liée à eux comme une autre étudiante de langue et je trouvais le travail très agréable.  


Je considère l’enseignement de l'anglais à l'étranger comme un excellent complément à mes études.   Je me suis spécialisée en linguistique pour ma licence, avec un mineur en français, et j'ai l'intention d'obtenir un master en orthophonie.  Je complète les cours préliminaires du master cette année.  Grâce à ma formation en linguistique et en orthophonie, j’ai l’habitude d’aborder les questions de langage analytiquement.  Mes études me donnent des connaissances métalinguistiques qui faciliteront l’enseignement de l'anglais aux francophones.  Je comprends la structure sous-jacente de l'anglais—sa syntaxe, sa phonologie, sa prosodie—et comment cette structure se compare à celle du français.  J’ai étudié les schémas d'acquisition du langage par les locuteurs non natifs et les difficultés ils rencontrent.  Je connais des techniques d’améliorer la prononciation ou la grammaire.  


Enseigner aux enfants en Montpellier a encouragé un intérêt à travailler comme orthophoniste avec des locuteurs non natifs ou dans un contexte international.   Il y a une demande croissante aux États-Unis pour les orthophonistes qui peuvent travailler avec ceux dont la langue maternelle n'est pas l'anglais.  Enseigner l'anglais me fournira l'occasion de travailler avec des locuteurs pareils.  Je gagnerai également de l’expérience d’habiter et de travailler à l’étranger.  


Ce semestre à Montpellier, je n'ai jamais voyagé en dehors de la France.  En voyageant en France, j’ai profité de l’opportunité d'améliorer mon français et de découvrir la culture du pays.  Je garde un précieux souvenir de mon séjour en France !  La vie française me plaisait et j’aimerais habiter là encore.

I don't care if it's voted up/down karma'd or whatever I just wanna share.
background
Ok so, I took french in Canada till gr 9. (age 15) (not immersion, the regular shitty style). That was all, and late summer (age 25 now) 2011 I restarted learning it. At this point I had cereal box vocab and could probably order a sandwich, that's it (maybe A1 after 1 month lessons). However I was surprised that I still knew most pronounciation rules and had a good accent (says my gf). From that august until june 2012 I put in probably 1hour studying in the mornings 4-5 times per week. The goal was to get to B1 by june 2012. I used BBC mafrance, pimsleur, little workbooks, listened to slow news french. I have a swiss gf. She wasn't a miracle knowledge giver like a lot of people think. We are both in medschool. I did my french in the morning before my classes, and by the time we finish classes/ studying for the day, its difficult for someone who is use to speaking english with you to change to french and have the patience to chat with a beginner. 

So beginning of july (course started the monday after last med exam) I enrolled to Lausanne university ""cours de vacance"" tutor 6week program where I needed to test B1 to start. When I got there I had barely used any spoken french, but the 2 days I was there before the course at gf's family reunions really helped to kick start the immersion and hearing french all the time. I tested B1 because I knew grammar quite well and they place you pretty much based on the written/listening test, however I was realistically an A2. So A2/B1 class I was in for 3 weeks. Great 3 weeks, doing activities and breaking through using french daily. After 2nd test, the next 3weeks were in a B2 class with a bunch of borderline C1 students (prepping for attending french uni). Second 3 weeks were good classes also. (classes were 830-1200 with cafe break)

Tutoring part: during the 6 weeks I met 2xper week with a tutor, where we worked on my writing quality. I had to complete weekly investigative journals (go in town and record conversation then go home and write a page or 2 report on it), and attend a seminar 1/week for the first 4 weeks (an actual lecture usually by Msc or PHD student in the university on varying topics). The big assignment is an 8 page essay on a topic of on or the seminars. In the end I finished with a good B2 level I'd say.

What I learned. That course was great, however for that tutor program I just made it to hit the start level. Had I been any lower it would have been just completely overwhelming. Due to that I didn't do a lot of city interaction, most time was spent on writing, grammar and homework/vocab all to try and keep up. Cons, there are students from all over the world, and a lot of them have extremely difficult to understand accents in french. So group work can be somewhat like kicking water uphill sometimes. I was constantly tired, I was really driven to learn and that was the big factor. That full immersion without a big drive would be useless i think. I wouldn't reccomend it for a summer fun course or if you we're a total beginner. Immersion for me is better when you have a basis that you can build from. I found that in the beginning, I could understand all the words in speech, but the phrase meaning escaped me. After a while I could understand speech very well. But watching news and things, I could understand but couldn't remember the vocabulary they used. It was like my brain remembered the info in english (even though I wasn't translating it) and therefore it was difficult to summarise things in french. This got better after the course.

Need. In the year running up to the course doing french in the early hours before the day started sucked. Im learning french because I want to work in la suisse badly, so I have to have it and want it bad. If I was doing it for fun I think I would have given up and just slept in. I thing generating a pressing need is essential when learning a language alone.

French gf. Overrated. It's thrown around like a miracle for learning a language, as if get one when you're a beginner and in a year your fluent. Here the need factor comes in and if your SO is a natural teacher or not. Also even now that I can converse in french, we break down to english all the time because she's engrained me with an english assiciation. Its hard to reverse. If you are about the B1 level and get a french SO, use the language as much as you can in the beginning I would say.
So I guess I just wanted to share and say that even as a full time med student in a year you could be ""fluent"" in french. Could I survive living in a french place now? Yes, although i still confuse the masculine and feminine a lot, construct sentences oddly and have vocab holes (ie finance, environment and slang vocabularies). I can read novels well, get almost everything from news and émissions, but slang and movies still escape me however thats apparently normal for B2.

Again sorry for the randomness and wall of text, just wanted to share some encouragement talk a little about the course I took.

First post here. Living in Paris at the moment, and recently finished watching Curb Your Enthusiasm on DVD with French dubbing, which was a big help in picking up natural language.

I'm looking for a website that has *streaming* popular TV series or films originally in British/American English that have been dubbed into French. Subtitles or closed-captioning in both English and French are also a plus.

Everything is printed in French and English in Quebec. Even Canadian dollar bills are bilingual. I'm doing a lot of research for a trip to Montreal this summer.

But I have discovered that there is considerable language conflict in Quebec. There is a huge political divide between francophones and anglophones. I frequently learn about some new drama over language. For example, today the newspaper L'actualité announced their special feature [« Ici, on parle English »](http://www.lactualite.com/societe/quel-avenir-pour-le-francais-montreal). I've also read a book on this topic [""Sorry, I Don't Speak French: Confronting the Canadian Crisis That Won't Go Away""](http://www.amazon.com/Sorry-Dont-Speak-French-Confronting/dp/0771047673/) by Graham Fraser.

For the casual language learner, this drama is really fascinating. Learning a language can be a tedious and boring chore. Drama between your native language and the target language really spices it up a bit. Maybe the Québécois find it entertaining as well.

But I have been wondering why the battle between English and French is never mentioned in my French textbooks or Montreal travel guides? They paint a picture of a perfectly bilingual society which clearly does not exist (not in complete harmony). I also don't see other French language students discussing the language politics in Quebec. This is puzzling to me. 

I think there is some similar conflict between Spanish and English in the United States, but not as severe since English is more dominant.

&gt; ... You absolutely need to master the subjonctive if you do not want to sound like a moron. This tense is used in all Romance languages to denote possibility or doubt, and if you replace by anything else, which some locals do, you will sound like a moron. It is easy to understand and use if you study it for a couple days and rehearse some drills...

&gt; ... Do not make typos in French. If you think that you can write as you you wish as long as people understand, think again. This the country where people watch the Dictée on TV ! Typos in French are not taken kindly, and using modern spellchecking softwares, there is no reason why you should not be able to write flawless French.

For instance, if I address an older man informally, is my choice of ""tu"" somehow an affront to his character, like I'm calling him a child?  Would ""Qu'est-ce que tu manges?"" come across like ""What are you eating, boy?""  Would he be kind of weirded out that I was acting very chummy, like if I just met someone in an elevator and they started making extremely familiar small talk?  Or is it just some general, nondescript affront to respect that nobody really understands but follows regardless?  

Conversely, would throwing out ""vous"" for a child just make them giggle, like I was calling an American kid ""milady"" or some other such ostentatiously formal and respectful word?  You seem to use ""vous"" as both a term of respect (you - as one guy - have so much status that I have to address you as I would a crowd of lessers) but also as a generalized politeness (for waiters and whatnot), so I'm not sure what's implied in different situations.

Is there a turning point between vous and tu that is seen as some sort of relationship marker?  You call somebody vous throughout the acquaintance phase and then later on you think, ""You know what, I'm really starting to become friends with this guy or girl, it's time to switch over to the informal?""  So you call them up one day with your tu, and then they have to make a decision right then and there about whether you've become an informal-ready friend, sort of like a baby version of the first ""I love you"" in a relationship?

Additionally, can you make jokes about this tu/vous difference or would the French simply stare at you with bewilderment?

If someone was saying ""They [???]"" but forgets the verb, would they say ""Ils... euh..."" with a liaison? i.e. would it sound like: ""Il**z**uh""?  If there is no liaison there, what if the verb starts with a vowel? Would you say ""Ils... euh... entendent"" as ""Il uh **z**entend""?

What about saying ""I am going to the [???]"" and forget the noun? Do you leave it as ""je vais à ...""? Do you assume the following noun is masculine? What if the noun is masculine would you say ""je vais à... à... le parc"" or would you correct the ""à"" to ""au"" for the contraction?

One of our teacher uses, and recommended, that we use French nursery rhymes to help with both our understanding and our pronunciation. 

His idea is that instead of stressing over our pronunciation, we can just follow the rhyme, and in trying to sing along, our pronunciation will automatically correct itself, since an incorrectly pronounced word would not fit the rhyme.

Also, it's a very good way of enhancing vocabulary, after all, native French kids learn the same way, right?

For example, today we were learning ""les jours de la semaine"" and we followed this rhyme:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvLJ_aFZ9Oc

When we were learning this topic in another class, our pronunciation for a lot of words was awkward. Following the rhyme however, our pronunciation smoothened, since we were singing along. Only problem was Vendredi, which our teacher then help us correct and then we were on our way.

My request is, could my fellow redditeurs recommend a website with a set of French nursery rhymes (preferably with lyrics)? I guess I could just youtube it, but I am not exactly sure what to look for, I mean, do French kids learn Ba Ba Black Sheep?

Oh, and with not too much background music, sometimes it creates difficulty in assessing the pronunciation.

Also, as an assignment, our teacher asked us to look for a particular french nursery rhyme, that goes something like this:

&gt;one, two, three

&gt;I walk into the wood

&gt;four, five, six

&gt;I pluck ripe cherries

&gt;seven, eight, nine

&gt;in my new basket

and so on. Has anyone ever heard of this one?",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,1341916785.0,,,True,t3_wblfq,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/wblfq/french_nursery_rhymes/,

Well in my city I feel like I'm in the dark. I know I could contact them but that is basically my point. Are all of these ran the same?  Like is there a standard that all of these locations must meet? My local branch is **[Alliance Française de Richmond](http://www.africhmond.net/)**. I have no idea where they are since there is no address on the website, I have no idea when the next date is because nothing is listed and on their site it just seems like the links go back to the membership page so that I can pay them.

In contrast, since I am moving, I decided to look up Seattle's branch. The Alliance de Française [Seattle's site](http://www.afseattle.org/) is like comparing night and day.  They even have a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/FrenchAmericanChamberofCommercePNW), a page for [local French cultural events](https://www.facebook.com/BastilleDayFestivalSeattle), [twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/AFSeattle) and [what you get as a member.](http://www.afseattle.org/membershipforms/afmembershipguide.pdf).

Maybe I am nit picking here but I feel if the point is to join this social organization they all should be set up similar to what Seattle is doing right? Isn't interaction the point here?  I don't even know the address to where mines is. I am just wondering what, if any, standards are across the country or is it up to each location to throw things together? Is there any reason why Richmond has a simple .net and comcast email address compared to Seattle's .org  domain and email? Judging by the websites it seems like the PNW has a lot more going for it than here and they're both the same price to join right?

She approached me today about how to explain a certain discrepancy in tense in the beginning of a passage. I copied the text:

&gt; On avait débarrassé la table et le restaurant se vidait. Camille ne bougeait pas. Elle fumait et commandait des cafés pour ne pas être mise à la porte. 

&gt; The table had been cleared and the restaurant was emptying. Camille did not move. She was smoking and kept ordering coffee so they wouldn't throw her out.

Upon reading the French, it was very clear to me that the translation of ""bougeait"" had much more to do with Camille *not leaving* than *sitting still in her seat.* My colleague's first reading of the passage brought up more of an image of Camille *sitting still in her seat.* However, in French, if you had said ""personne ne bougeait,"" that would bring more of an image of people *sitting still*, rather than  *not vacating.*

I'd say that she *didn't move* as a reaction to the restaurant closing (in an act of defiance, almost), not that her act of not moving was a continuous state (as in *sitting still in her seat*). Another native English speaker colleague agreed with me. 

But, how do you explain this to your students? The French passage uses the imperfect, whereas this would be an error in English. You simply can't say ""Camille was not moving"" as opposed to ""Camille did not move,"" because it wouldn't have made any sense in relation to the previous sentence.

I'd think that if someone translated it as ""Camille was not moving"" (from French to English), it would be a forgivable error because it is a nuance that even some truly bilingual people would have trouble with. We all agreed on that much, but explaining WHY translating it into the imperfect in English is an error is sort of beyond any of us.",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,False,,L2,True,t3_quiwi,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/quiwi/subtle_differences_in_tense_that_are_hard_to/,

I have a few. These aren't necessarily the easiest or clearest to learn from, but I like the music, which makes listening to them easier:

- MC Solaar
- Paris Combo

Where should I look to find some help?,ChrisloriousHD,13,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1gofjc/im_very_interested_in_relearning_and_expanding_my/,"I took 2 years of French in High School. I have always had a love for travel and I actually really enjoyed learning the language. I had a rough time learning from the book itself but I was able to pick it all up through oral practice very easily. At the time I had a friend from France on an old Nintendo DS game (Metroid Prime Hunters) and I learned a lot through talking to him.

It has been a little over 5 years since I stopped taking those courses and frankly I have forgotten almost everything. My grammar and punctuation in the language was always pretty good so I'm sure I could pick back up fairly quickly. I have been wanting to continue studying it for a good while but between school and other things going on in my life I just never felt like I had the time to do so. It just felt like an overwhelming thought.

I am planning on getting married next year and I would really want to go to Paris on my honeymoon. I really want to learn to speak the language fluently by then. I want to be able to take my time and immerse myself in the culture while I am there without having to worry about a language block.

I feel as though based on past experiences with the language that in order to do this I need to have a vast amount of just oral conversation in the language. I think the easiest way for me to learn would be to have a group of friends who natively speak the language that can talk to me on Skype from time to time. Of course I will use some other form of studying through text but for me that only goes so far. My girlfriend will be moving close to me hopefully within a month (from 2 1/2 hour drive to 5 minute drive) and I will hopefully be getting her speaking the language as well so we can just practice with each other often.

My main questions are:

* Where would I best be able to find some cool French speaking people, both male and female, who are willing to Skype chat often?

* What sort of text/learning program should I use?

TL;DR I really want to learn French and I would do best orally. Where could I find some good Skype friends who speak it as their first language and what learning program should I use for self study?",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,False,,L2,True,t3_1gofjc,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/1gofjc/im_very_interested_in_relearning_and_expanding_my/,

..why is this reflexive? It's much easier to understand when the speaker is the direct object, such as in:  
  
se regarder  
to look at oneself  
  
But se moquer de makes no sense to me. What happens if we just say Je moque de toi., rather than Je me moque de toi.?
  
  
In the reflexive version, what's being conceptualized in the French brain? Is it something like:

""I, myself, mock you."" or ""I make myself mock you.""? But then for that matter, what would ""Je le moque de toi."" mean? If the previous example is correct then it should mean something like ""I make him mock you"". More likely it probably doesn't make any sense at all though.

Please email popupdichci AT gmail.com if you are interested!**

First of all, I hope I'm not breaking any of this subreddit's rules. I've checked and I think I'm okay. However, please let me know if this thread is inappropriate.

I am an MS Computer Engineering student and I've developed a French dictionary extension for Google Chrome called popupDic (short for ""popup Dictionary""). The extension is designed to help beginner/intermediate learners of French who frequently read French texts/articles online better memorize new words that they come across. A short video tour of the extension's features can be found here: [http://youtu.be/bTHiU30ZFkg](http://youtu.be/bTHiU30ZFkg).

The extension has been developed as a semester project for one of my courses. As the next stage of the project, I need to find people to test the interface. The testing procedure will last 2 or 3 days and is entirely online. It basically consists of reading a short French-language text on the Internet each day of the study. I will explain the whole procedure to interested parties but I estimate that it shouldn't take more than 10-15 minutes a day.

If you find this extension interesting and would like to participate, please send an email to popupdichci AT gmail.com. In case it's relevant, I would like to say that I do not require any personally identifiable information from any study participant. Also, the project is due in the middle of next week, so it would be really nice to find some study participants by Saturday.

Thank you for reading.


**EDIT: Just wanted to add some clarifications.**  

* The extension is a dictionary app. It will only translate words piecemeal. It will not translate whole sentences for you. What it will do (hopefully) is to make it easier to remember new words.
* I am looking for people who are at **INTERMEDIATE-fluency** levels. Since that is rather a loosely-defined term, basically I'm looking for people who can read something like a news article in French online (perhaps something like you'd find on http://www.slate.fr and still find words that they do not know.
* The testing procedure is entirely online, but you will need to have Google Chrome installed because the extension can only run on it (it won't run on another browser like Safari or Firefox, for example).",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,True,,,True,t3_sj4su,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/sj4su/help_evaluate_my_french_dictionary_extension/,

High school French (I graduated 8 years ago) focused mainly on written/read, so, while I can still get the gist of some written French, my oral skills are basically non-existent. I took a one-semester beginner course as a refresher at a University here. I did quite well, but after enrolling in the next level (due to start this week), it was canceled due to low enrollment. I'm admittedly a terrible self-motivator, so a scheduled class was perfect. So...now what?

There are no other appropriate courses I can make it to with my work schedule. The $300 I got back when the class was canceled almost pays for the full Levels 1-5 Rosetta Stone package or a decent start with Pimsleur. However, both of these will aim me towards ""France French"" instead of ""Quebecois French"" (I don't know if that's much of an issue at my level, though). I could also use that money for a tutor and get maybe 15 hours of one-on-one help (albeit from someone who isn't necessarily a qualified teacher). Or I could ______?

My intuition is that *Dieu* is not a lexical exception, but that we are saying different things when we say *croire en* and *croire à*. For example, I believe I can say that in the Book of Numbers in the Bible, we see that Israelites *commencèrent à croire en Baal*, another god. Moreover I can say of Satanists, who believe in the existence of God but who belive that Satan is the one deserving of worship, *Ils croient à Dieu*. And I imagine that atheists could be said to *ne croire ni en Dieu ni à Dieu*. The first example should demonstrate that *Dieu* is not the only word that could be used with *croire en* and the second two should demonstrate that *Dieu* could be used with *croire à*, presuming that my hypothesis is right.

Hier soir j'ai rencontré avec mes amis parce que nous avions besoin de nous préparer pour un présentation ce lundi.  Réalisant que nous avions faim, nous avons décidé de visiter un restaurant marocain qui était proche à l'endroit où nous étudiions. 

La nourriture était vraiment savoureuse.  J'ai commandé le veau avec des légumes.  Il y avait des carottes, des pois, et de la courgette.  La viande était bien fait et moelleuse.  

La musique qu'ils jouaient était un mélange de chansons marocains en français et arabique.  J'aimerais bien de trouver les instruments utilisés dans leur pays.  

Comme nous partions j'ai trouvé le courage de dire au serveur, qui était aussi le caissier qu'on avait bien mangé et avoir une bonne nuit.  Il y avait une pause de plusieurs secondes et j'avais peur qu'il ne me comprenait pas et que j'avais fait une grande faute.  Heureusement, il s'est levé la tête et a dit merci pour venir et a demandé où j'avais appris le français, à Montréal ou en France.  

J'ai dit &lt;&lt;à Toronto&gt;&gt; et nous avions une petite conversation.  Il m'a dit que le français était son deuxième langue après l'arabique et si je vais en France pendant trois mois ou un autre endroit français que j'apprendrais beaucoup.  Je lui ai dit que c'était la première fois j'ai vu le chaine de nouvelles Al Jazeera en Canada et comment je trouve que parler avec les autres gens et regarder les films français sont les meilleurs moyens d'apprendre la langue.

3. *Aller* vs. *S'en aller* : This is very commonly used but is not very obvious to the beginner. *Aller* means ""to go,"" whereas *S'en aller* means ""to leave!""

I live in Louisiana and so naturally there is quite a bit of French influence here. I was visiting a cemetery today in Plaquemine where some of the gravestones were written in English and some in French. I found a somewhat interesting one, and I was hoping if someone here would be able to explain it to me.

[This is a picture of the gravestone.](http://i.imgur.com/xJa2fQQ.jpg)


As you can obviously see, it says:

&gt;Ici repose

&gt;TRASIMOND LEBLANC

&gt;D. C. D.

&gt;le 25 Déc 1857.

I was wondering about the ""D. C. D."" part. It seems like a play on words to me, being pronounced as ""décédé"", meaning Trasimond Leblanc died December 25, 1857 (Merry friggin Christmas!). But it's obviously also an abbreviation for something. I would naively guess ""Dédié son Corps à Dieu"".

I have searched a little to figure out what this means, but haven't found anything helpful. I also haven't delved into the bowels of Google yet. Anyway, I hope you find this interesting and can shed some light on it.

It's probably just the way it is, but I was curious about if there is a certain explanation for it. Here are some examples from my home, Montreal:

Boulevard named after René Lévesque = Boulevard René-Lévesque

City named after some saint = Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue

Metro station serving [Place des Arts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_des_arts) = Station Place-des-Arts

There are some things that I never even see without hyphens, so I'm wondering where you draw the line between having to hyphenate it or not. For example, the neighbourhood of [Notre-Dame-de-Grâce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_de_Grace). I have never seen anything written as ""Notre Dame de Grace."" Would that form without hyphens maybe be reserved for talking about the actual Virgin Mary?

Another one is the area of [Côte-des-Neiges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cote_des_Neiges). This one really confuses me. The hyphenation implies that the Côte-des-Neiges neighbourhood is named after something called Côte des Neiges, but this area *is* the actual ""slope of snows."" So why isn't it just called Côte des Neiges since it's the actual thing, and then the road running through it could still be called [Chemin de la Côte-des-Neiges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%B4te-des-Neiges_Road) because it's named after it?

If we built a park named for its location on the Chemin de la Côte-des-Neiges, would it be called Parc Chemin-de-la-Côte-des-Neiges?

If we built a metro station by that park and named it after the park, would it be Station Parc-Chemin-de-la-Côte-des-Neiges?

[Renaud-Bray](http://www.renaud-bray.com) has many stores and you can order from them online. They have been my major supplier of Quebecois literature. I didn't find their Côte-des-Neiges flagship store to be that impressive but the store in the Complexe Desjardins had a good selection of Quebecois literature. There is also a Archambault store in the Complexe Desjardins.

Newspapers. The 24 Heures paper is free and can be found in metro station entrances (except on weekends). La Presse is also free and is handed out by vendors outside Berri-UQAM Station. Voir is free and can be found at some metro stations. Le Journal de Montréal was hard to find. Eventually I bought a copy at a Maison de la Presse Internationale store.

I had to buy an extra piece of luggage for all the books I bought! Here are some of my major finds:

* Petit guide de parler québécoi 
* Larousse Conjugaison
* Petit Futé Bruxelles (another culture to explore)
* Nouvelle-Orleans travel guide 
* Cajun French Dictionary
* Kit De Conversation Neerlandais (a French book on Dutch)
* Les Muses Orphelines by Michel Marc Bouchard (a play)
* Le matou by Yves Beauchemin (thick novel)
* Grammaire italienne (I plan to study a little Italian)
* These Festive Nights by Marie-Claire Blais
* Paolo Paoli by Arthur Adamov
* Pictures On The Wall Of Your Heart: Tom Wesselmann Und Die Pop Art (there was an exhibit at the Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal)
* L’avalée des avalés by Réjean Ducharme (very hard to find)
* Enfirouapé by Yves Beauchemin
* Robert Lepage book
* Balconville by David Fennario
* Cockroach by Rawi Hage

Besides books and newspapers, I think my exploration of various neighborhoods will provide me with the necessary context to understand the Quebecois novels and plays I bought. I visited Old Montreal, Little Italy, Mile End, Outremont, The Plateau, Côte-des-Neiges, Notre-Dame-de-Grace, Westmount, Quartier Latin, and Quartier des Spectacles.",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,False,,,True,t3_xijmn,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/xijmn/montreal_for_french_language_learning_materials/,

_______________________________
Je me réveille sur un grand terrain, l'été, il fait chaud, il fait soleil, l'air n'est pas trop humide, un vent agréable parcourt mes cheveux. J'ai des cheveux! Ils semblent avoir poussé, je regarde mes mains, j'ai l'impression d'avoir pris un coup de vieux. Il y a une maison derrière moi, maison étrangement familière, même si je n'ai aucune idée d'où je suis. Je parcours ce terrain, j'examine les environs, je ne connais pas l'endroit, mais quelque chose au fond de moi me dit que je suis déjà venu ici, je retourne dans la cours arrière.

La porte n'est pas verrouillée, quelque chose me pousse à entrer, une sensation de déjà-vu mêlée à une sensation de grand bien-être m'envahit. Je visite cette maison étrange, sans aucune crainte. Les pièces sont bien aménagées, la peinture semble être parfaitement assortie. Une bonne odeur semble s'y être installé. Quelque chose est en train de cuire, une brise agréable passe par la fenêtre. Tout me semble si serein, si paisible. Ce ne peut être qu'un rêve. J'explore la maison comme un enfant explorerait un terrain de jeu,  j'aboutis au fond d'un couloir, face à des escaliers. Je fixe le haut, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes passent. Étrangement, un sentiment d'angoisse m'empêche de monter, la peur remplace la sérénité. J'entends un bref son, une simple petite vibration qui pousse anormalement ma curiosité à sa limite. Je mets un pied sur une marche, puis sur l'autre, puis sur l'autre, de plus en plus vite, je finis par courir dans les escaliers, un couloir apparait devant moi, l'odeur d'un parfum familier me vient au nez, je continue de courir, malgré toutes les portes présentes je sais exactement laquelle je veux ouvrir. Quelques mètres à peine, pourtant cela me semble durer une éternité. J'enfonce brusquement la porte, le temps se fige. Une magnifique femme aux longs cheveux est assise là, devant moi, et me sourit. Tout me semble si flou, je suis confus. Un rayon de soleil matinal entre par la fenêtre. Une fois de plus le son de tout à l'heure parvient à mes oreilles. Ce son, ce simple petit son provient de ses mains, de tes mains! Je te reconnais, tu te lèves, tu m'embrasses. Mon coeur se gonfle, des larmes coulent le long de mes joues. Je suis rempli d'un grand sentiment de joie. Je regarde tes mains, tu es en train de bercer un magnifique enfant. Tu me murmures quelque chose à l'oreille, mais il n'y a aucun son.

Tout devient sombre, le sentiment de joie disparaît, il laisse place à un épouvantable sentiment d'angoisse. Mon coeur est gonflé, mais de tristesse plutôt que de joie, mon estomac est noué, mes yeux trempés. Je viens, malheureusement, de me réveiller...

C'est le rêve que j'ai fait cette nuit, c'est aussi ce que j'aimais bien m'imaginer lorsque je travaillais de nuit alors que tu dormais paisiblement ou encore quand tu me manquais énormément. J'aimerais avoir la chance de te faire retomber amoureuse de moi, cependant, je ne peux t'empêcher de partir.

Les Rêves de l'Amour Ou Les Rêves de Notre Vie?

Paris, la ville de l'amour, la ville des rêves pour beaucoup des personnes, la ville où ces rêves meurent ou sont accompli. C'est l'histoire d'un homme et une femme jeune qui se connaissaient pendant une courte période. L'homme s'appelais Jean-Michael et la femme s'appelais Béatrice. Jean-Michael étais Québecois et il a voyagé à Paris pendant l'été pour trois mois. Il étais grand comme un arbre, maigre comme une brineille, mais avec des yeux noisette. Quand Jean-Michael a visité Monmantre, il a tacheté Béatrice dans la pharmacie qui est proche de la structure. Béatrice avais des cheveux noirs avec des yeux blue cièle comme la Méditerranée. Jean-Michael étais nerveux, mais il a assez de courage de s'introduir à Béatrice. C'est là où leur histoire d'amour a commencé.
	Avant de sortir, la différence entre les deux est évidente. Jean-Michael aime s'habiller avec jeans et un chemise; il s'habillait toujours comme si il va aller au rendez-vous avec quelqu'un. Béatrice est simple. Elle aime les robes à fleurs avec des foulards coloré.
	Pendant les trois mois, ils sont allés à beacoup des endroits. Par exemple, Versailles, Musée du Louvre, Normandy, et plusieurs des autres endroits tout au long de la France. À fin de ses aventures, Jean-Michael est tombé amoureux de Béatrice. 
	Les deux étaient sur un pont avec un vue sur la Rivère Seine. Le ciel étais rose et violet, pendant que les voitures passent sur la rue comme des lucioles sur la pâturage verts. Le pont étais vieux mais fort comme son sûr de soi. Les deux eux étaient au coude à coude. Jean-Michael s'est turné à Béatrice et l'a dit:
	«Béatrice, je t'adore et j'espère que tu m'adore aussi!» Il continue, «Je veux une famille avec toi et aussi je veux voyager avec toi. Je crois, non, je sais que c'est notre déstinée!»
Béatrice, sympathique et compréhensive avec l'amour de Jean-Michael à-t-elle, mais même si elle l'aime, ella a des rêves et des buts différent. Elle l'a renpondu:
	«Jean-Michael, je t'adore aussi, et croyez-moi, je voudrais une vie comme ça, mais», elle soupire,  «j'ai des rêves et des buts que je veux et doit acommplir. Je préfère finir mes études, avoir un job, et être stable dans mon job. Je préfère attendre jusqu'à je suis prête pour un relation. Je suis désolé Jean-Michael.»
Elle l'a embrassé passionnément et après ça, elle a disparu. Jean-Michael, avec un cœur brisé, il pleure, il pleure jusqu'à il est arrivée chez lui au Québec. Il s'a dit, «Paris, la ville de l'amour, la ville des rêves pour beaucoup des personnes, la ville où ces rêves meurent ou sont accompli. Mon rêve, il est mort dans Paris... il est mort.»

I'm far from fluent but I'm generally fine with pronunciation, reading and writing - it's just that whenever I try and watch something in French the words fly over me and I don't have a single clue as to what they're saying. It's not that I don't understand the words they're using, I just can't translate quickly in my head nor distinguish separate words.. it just sounds like a blur of sounds.

Hi /r/French! I'm sort of in the shitter with a university assignment. I need to interview a French person but haven't managed to find one. In my desperation, I turn to you: I have pre-recorded some questions in French; would any of you wonderful people be willing to record yourselves answering them? The interview is only 10 minutes or so, and you will officially have saved my ass and have my eternal gratitude. Just reply or PM me and I'll send them to you. *Merci mille fois!*",,False,self,t5_2rd5t,True,,,True,t3_o12ff,http://www.reddit.com/r/French/comments/o12ff/would_any_fluent_french_speaker_be_willing_to_let/,

Here's all I remember from these photos. (Or maybe I should say ""snapshots."" Here you go: http://imgur.com/a/Q7xV2#0) 


* Photo #1: Some folk tale (?) of some saint that roamed around without his head for some reason.

* Photo #2: Some famous French painter who lived in Montmarte painted this building. Of course the van had to be in the way of it. ;/ The painter's name would be nice and perhaps a link to the painting.

* Photo #3: I completely forgot what the significance of this was.






Thank you for your help, r/French :D

Merci d'avance !
