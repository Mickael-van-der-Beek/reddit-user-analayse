It's not long or complicated.

I've posted this in many threads over the past week, and I think it is extremely helpful for beginners, so I want to make this it's own post. Maybe it can be linked in the sidebar, to save some folks some headaches.

No. Don't use GUIMiner. It's good to see if you want to mine, but it is far from the most efficient. Also, make sure you're not using more electricity than you're making in bitcoins. (http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/)

Try cgminer or bfgminer, they both use a .conf file you can edit and save your settings, so you can just open the .exe and start mining. Have a look around bitcointalk.org's mining software forum, and you'll find plenty of help there.

The rest of the post will be using commands and settings based on [BFGMiner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=168174.0) so go grab a copy and play along. I'm also going to assume you're in windows, but it really isn't much different in *nix.

Run the client with the options like this either in a command prompt or from a shortcut(or you can just run the .exe and follow the onscreen instructions to set up a pool):

    bfgminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://mmpool.bitparking.com:3333 -u YourWorkername -p WorkerPassword

Once you're in the program, and you see your cards spitting out shares, pres ""S"" then ""W"" and hit enter twice to get back to the main screen. This creates a config file, saving all your settings. Now to run the program in the future all you need to do is run the .exe (no need for the extra options now)

To change anything, now all you have to do is edit the bfgminer.conf Make sure you don't mess with the formatting, however. If you want to learn how to properly format it by yourself, look up JSON formatting. The easiest way to add more pools (for backup when your primary pool goes down, etc) is from bfgminer itself by hitting ""P"" then ""A"" and follow the onscreen prompts. once your new pool is added, make sure you save your config file like we did before.

For how to squeeze every last MH/s out of your chips, you'll want to fiddle with some configuration settings.

In your bfgminer.cfg at the top should be your primary and backup pools, followed by something that looks like this:

    ""intensity"" : ""9"",
    ""vectors"" : ""2"",
    ""worksize"" : ""128"",
    ""kernel"" : ""diablo"",

with a bunch of other options at the bottom that you don't need to change(if you have 2 or more gpus, it will look similar, but with comma separated values like ""d,d"" for intensity). You can mess with the intensity, 9 is the max you'll want to go at all, but if you still want to use the desktop that is being rendered, you'll want to go down to ""d"" which is a dynamic intensity. Try modifying the vectors try out 1, 2, 4, and 8 to see what gives better results. Worksize is the same, 64,128,256 are what you should try. Kernel is a big one I think the default is ""poclbm"" but i find diablo has given me better results. If you're running a 7000-series try ""diakgcn"" that is designed for it.

Play with these settings, edit them, save the .conf and then hit ""S"" ""B"" and ""Y"" to quickly restart bfgminer without having to open the .exe again. You'll have to do this lots of times until you find the right combination of kernel, vectors, and worksize that works for your GPU.

Once this is done, get MSI Afterburner to Overclock the core as far as you feel comfortable, while also lowering the Memory Clock to lower power usage, as Bitcoin isn't memory intensive like other cryptocurrencies. Afterburner makes it easy to have multiple profiles so you can easily switch between mining and gaming. Both cgminer and BFGMiner come with some overclocking capabilities integrated, but I've not had much luck with them. You can try it yourself, but I've had much more reliable and stable results by using AB.

I think I've covered most of it, hopefully this has helped. Please feel free to ask questions or point out mistakes, or even add helpful tips.

**EDIT:** Here is my response to [Endlessa's comment seen here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1dmn62/anybody_caught_abusing_newbies_or_making_fun_of/c9s1kiv) I'm adding it to this OP as I think it helps depict the mods views on how we run this subreddit.

&gt;OK I understand that, but the reality is he should not be buying raw chips if he doesn't know what to do with it..... he went face first into something stupid and wants intelligent people to save him.... this is a forum for new people to share experience not for stupid people to supplement their ignorance 

&gt;-Endlessa

Then explain that to him and don't be a dick about it. (Not saying you were a dick about anything.)

This is a business oriented subreddit. A lot of people who come here have or are about to spend a lot of money (in their eyes) on new hardware. The last thing they are looking for is to be laughed at for their incompetence.

There are no stupid questions on /r/BitcoinMining as far as the moderating team are concerned.

If you guys don't want to answer the questions properly in an adult fashion then don't. Somebody else will.

Leave the subreddit if you don't like these terms. Who's stopping you? But **if you'll think about it, these terms are probably the reason you began coming here in the first place.**

The user /u/AcidophileBTC has been spamming threads with links to a 'Beginners BTC Miner'.

I don't know if it actually mines, but it definitely has a sinister component. My guess is that he's trying to steal credit card numbers or secretly add unsuspecting users' machines to his botnet (or both). It secretly installs an IRC client, (these are often used to control botnet nodes). I haven't had much time to dig through the code, but it's definitely not something you want to run.

1366161382.0,32,self.BitcoinMining,1ci3dc,"Frequently Asked Question: What's an ASIC, FPGA?",purelithium,38,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1ci3dc/frequently_asked_question_whats_an_asic_fpga/,"So you're sick of just mining on your GPU, and not a fan of the electric bill after a month of mining? There has to be a better option out there than your loud GPU in your gaming computer. There is!

Shortly after GPUs became popular for bitcoin mining, enterprising folks started looking at other things they can re-purpose to mine bitcoins more efficiently. Around mid-year 2011, the first devices sprang up that are called FPGAs or Field Programmable Gate Arrays. These are nothing new to the hobbyist community, they've been around for a while for crackers and other security-conscious folks looking at ways to defeat cryptographic locks. Hey! I know something that uses cryptographic calculations to secure its network! BITCOINS! Yep, so some miners developed their own boards and slapped some FPGA chips on them (most commonly the Spartan-6), and wrote specific firmware and ""bitstreams"" to more efficiently calculate bitcoin hashes. The first generations were sort of slow, but still they had better efficiency than a GPU. Some of the latest generation included the Icarus boards, Cairnsmore, x6500, and ModMiner Quad.

In early 2012(i think my timeline is right), Butterfly Labs(BFL) was selling their own FPGA miner that hashed at 800 Mhash/s using 80 watts and only cost US$600 amazing! These grew very popular, but people could see that FPGAs still weren't the most efficient way to hash their shares. BFL then announced that they would be designing their own chips that would be orders of magnitude faster than anything ever seen. These would be the ASICs (or Application Specific Integrated Circuit)everyone is raving about. ASICs are--as the name implies--specifically designed for one thing, and one thing only. Bitcoins. This is all it can do, and can't really be repurposed like an FPGA to other applications. Who wouldn't want a US$150 ""Jalapeno"" that hashes at 3.5 GIGAhashes/s using only power from a USB port?? Crazy! So summer 2012, BFL says they will ship before Christmas. Various things happen and we now still don't have any confirmed ship dates from BFL.

A few other companies have sprouted up, ASICminer which I believe is developing their own chips to mine themselves, but in a responsible way as to not threaten the network with a sudden influx of hashing. bASIC was a fiasco that was developed by the creator of the ModMiner Quad(which is actually a fantastic miner, I own one, and love it.) where he took many preorders, promised lots of people amazing ASIC performance, but in early 2013 the stress of the whole endeavour got to him and he gave up, refunded money(I think it's still being refunded now, or maybe it's been cleared up already.)

Avalon is the only company we know has ASIC mining hardware in the wild. It is not certain exactly how many are out there, but they have been confirmed by independent sources. The Avalon units are expensive(75 BTC) and have been in limited production runs (or batches) of a few hundred units that were pre-sold out very quickly. 

All of this info is gleaned from the [Custom Hardware forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=76.0) over at bitcointalk.org over the past year or so I've been involved in bitcoin. I may have some facts wrong, but this is the gist of the situation and hopefully gives you an insight on the state of the hardware war against bitcoin

With the announcement of new USB Mining Hardware from ASICMiner (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=195004.msg2025318#msg2025318), I'm sure a lot of people are yelling ""SHUTUP AND TAKE MY MONEY"" but can't quite afford the minimum purchase of ""more than 300 devices."" I therefor propose a Reddit group buy.

Terms:

**My Responsibilities:**

Within one hour of making this post, I will send friedcat a private message expressing interest in purchasing a group of Block Erupters.

I will keep an encrypted wallet on my computer, with an updated backup of the encrypted wallet.dat on the cloud at all times.

Within 72 hours of receipt of confirmed orders for 301 Block Erupters, I will post on this subreddit that the minimum number of orders has been reached, and, if possible, give everyone 24 hours to get final orders in. I reserve the right to place the order immediately, without the above notice, if, in my judgment, delay would risk an inability to secure an order with ASICMiner.

Upon receiving Block Erupters from ASICMiner, I will ship all units with tracking information within 72 hours.

Upon request, I will provide any of the moderators of this subreddit with my personal information, including full name, address, telephone number, and a copy of state issued ID.

If ASICMiner will not accept my order, or if by May 31, 2013, this groupbuy has not received 301 orders, then within 72 hours I will return all bitcoins sent, less transaction fees.

** Your Responsibilities **

To place an order for (a) Block Erupter(s):

1. Send 2.04 BTC (or 2.14 BTC if shipping outside the US) per Block Erupter ordered to

1MKSrWLnfmShjHViDMngVdB7QM1frLML2h

2. Post the transaction ID and bitcoin address to use to return coins to in the event that the group buy fails as a new reply in this thread.

3. Private message me with your shipping address.

** Other Terms **

All disputes under this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California. Parties agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the county of Santa Clara, California.

No party to this agreement shall be held liable for failure of ASICMiner to ship Block Erupters.

Damages for breach shall be limited to return of bitcoins.

In the event that not all orders by reddit users can be filled, Block Erupters will be sent out on a first ordered, first shipped basis.

-------

So, other stuff (not part of contract). Let me try to answer some of your likely concerns:

*This is a scam/Why should I trust you?*

Of course, you're welcome not to. That being said, here's a few reasons you might think I'm trustworthy:

* I've been on Reddit over two years - this would be a very complicated way to scam someone.

* I'll be sending mods my personal information so that they (and you) are free to sue me if this turns into a scam.

* I have at least one positive bitcoin related transaction under my belt - http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1cb45l/games_that_come_along_with_my_mining_gpus_for/c9g7jfd?context=3

* I'm a law student (see my posts on /r/lawschool) and currently applying for a moral character determination in California. Scamming you would really screw up my professional career.

* I'm requiring that transactions be posted here to increase transparency. People will be able to tell if/when money has been sent, and (if necessary), if/when money has been refunded.

*Why all the legalese?*

Like I just said, I'm a law student ;-)

That being said, this is pretty straight forward.

In the first section, I'm saying I'll keep the coins I receive safe, give the reddit community a last chance to get in on the order, place the order promptly, and ship the order. If I can't do that, I'll refund your bitcoins (none of the BFL bullshit where they take your bitcoins, wait for the market to explode, and refund you in cash).

If you want to order, send me money, post here with proof that you did so, and PM me where to ship your order to.

The other stuff: Don't sue me in timbuktu, don't sue me if ASICMiner does something wrong. If something does go wrong, don't expect anything more than getting your bitcoins back. I will ship out orders first made, first shipped.

*I don't have bitcoins - can I use paypal or something?*

Nope; that might make me a money transmitter under FinCEN regs, and I'm not bonded for that.

The true answer to that question if you are being pedantic is:  Yes, you can!

The time required to get setup initially and the electrical efficiency of the hardware in question usually deduces the same answer from economically minded people, however. Which is: ***No!***

Bitcoin mining is a highly competitive technological [arms race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race), and you should never bring a knife to a gun fight.

The only two types of Bitcoin miners you want to be looking at right now are:

 * ASIC (Better option, if you can get one)
 * FPGA (Always available, not the best [ROI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment) at the moment however)

I just wrote a quick **[VBS script](http://pastebin.com/dZ2wtv8X)** that shows I'll only have 22 (15+7) by end of June. Not too shabby, but definitely not 48. Just wanted to post an update. Feel free to use the script!

So I've posted here a few times in the past. Now I'll detail what I'm doing a little further and try to help others.

Right now I'm working with 5x 7950's, 3x 7850's, a 6750, and 3x GTX 580's (my gaming rig). My hash rate is about 4,500 MH/s. I started this project using the DRIP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend_reinvestment_plan) principles in mind. I call this MRIP (Mining Reinvestment Plan). The plan is to reinvest all bitcoins mined into more mining hardware. Today I just purchased two more 7950's that are due to arrive tomorrow. Note that these two cards were purchased with bitcoins that were mined. This should bring my hash rate up to about 5660 MH/s, which will let me purchase another card next monday. The plan is every time I have enough to buy another card, I withdraw the bitcoins and convert it into cash. At this rate I'm hoping to have about 48 additional 7950 cards by the end of June or about 33,000 MH/s (33GH/s).

To those I haven't gotten back with about hardware that I'm ordering, I do apologize. I'm using *ported* 7950's. I STRESS ported cards ([ported on top, other on bottom](http://www.legitreviews.com/images/reviews/1862/sapphire-7950-reference.jpg)) because they throw the heat out of the chassis. When clustering 12 cases together (4x12=48 cards) it's not ideal to ""just leave the side off and hope it's cool it enough"". These cases will be slammed up against each other. Going to back to hardware, I still haven't decided on a locked feature set - meaning I don't know what I'm going to buy (mobo, ram, cpu, psu, etc). Ideally I want to keep the core system down to about $70/PCI-e slot, but I have to factor in space (hashing density too).

I say this because hardware pricing is always changing, but I want to lock the specs down eventually because it'll be easy to administer. Having 12 like systems will be easier to deploy than 12 totally different systems (all I have to do is image them). Being a net/sys admin I'll probably administer them with a PXE boot image (which I plan on making that publicly available along with the system specs). Anyways I apologize about that.

I run an IT consulting company on the side and thus I have A CRAP LOAD of old machines with a working PCI-e slot (or two or three). I'll be using these up and then will start building out a system.

Going back to mining, I'm not sure what ASIC's have in store for us. The difficulty could rise so much that by end of June I only have 4 more GPUs instead of 48. My hope is that the difficulty will not go up that high as ASIC's are still very hard to come by and really don't make a good investment case right now (or then). Looking at the difficulty graphs, TH/s seem to be leveling off in the near future - but only time will tell! Let me know if this helps! FYI I have put $0 into this so far, as I've been using old hand-me-down GPU's...

UltraSPARC_1 = 4x 7950's  UltraSPARC_2 = 1x 7950  UltraSPARC_3 = 6750  UltraSPARC_4/5/7 = 7850  UltraSPARC_6 = 3x GTX 580 UltraSPARC_8 = 2x 7950

**EDIT 2:** A lot of you have mentioned why not buy an ASIC or aren't you afraid the difficulty will skyrocket?! I just don't see that happening soon, and [this post makes my case quite nicely.](http://organofcorti.blogspot.com/2013/04/914-asic-earnings-23-april-2013.html) They're even assuming that Butterfly Labs will start shipping in quantity lol

I didn't do all of the comparisons necessary though - so there may be one better.

The question is, at what point does bitcoin-mining on a 7970 no longer make financial sense?

This is really simple math, and I hope we can avoid a lot of this question being asked over and over again by showing how simple it **is**.

The following assumes a miner is receiving a roughly equitable share of its contribution to the network's hash power (ie through a pool, if you're GPU Mining or considering getting in to mining) these things will be true.

Variables you can edit.

* Cost per kWh - I am assuming $0.15, as this is on the lower-upper bound of prices in the US.

* Card Cost and Amortization - it is a generally accepted accounting principal (GAAP) to amortize the cost of an asset purchase over a 2-year lifespan. It probably makes more sense here to use 1-year, but 2-years is standard. Feel free to play with this number.

* The BTCUSD exchange rate.

That's it, actually. Everything else is just the protocol specification. So here we go...

------------------------

**Question 1:** What is the daily cost of operation for a 7970 (not including the rest of the computer)?

* A 7970 has a *reported* power draw of 250W
* 250W running all day is 6 kWh per day.
* 6 kWh per day is $0.90 per day @ $0.15 per kWh
* At $90/BTC, this yields a daily electricity cost of 0.01 BTC
* At $400 on NewEgg, a 7970 has an amortized cost of $0.55 per day ($400 / 365 days/year*2years)
* $0.55 is 0.0061 BTC

**Operating Costs** = 0.0161 BTC

----------------------------------------
**Question 2**: How much of the network will I have to capture with my card to earn *at least* 0.0161 BTC per day?

* The network yields approximately 3600 BTC per day (25 bitcoin / block * 6 blocks per hour * 24 hours per day)
* 0.0161/3600 = 0.0004472%

**Answer:** The card must be capturing **0.0004472%** of the total network to earn at least 0.0161 BTC per day.

---------------------------------------

**Question 3:** How big does the network have to be before the 7970 is no longer profitable?

* The 7970 operates at a **reported** 650MH/s
* This will remain profitable until 650MH/s is less than 0.0004472% of the total network.
* 650(MH/s) / 0.000004472 =  145.3 TH/s

**Answer**: The 7970 will be profitable until the total network hashrate exceeds **145.3 TH/s**.

-----------------
Summary
---
This is just an easy maths model you can use to apply to any question you may have with regard to the 'potential profitability' of your current graphics card or even your potential ASIC purchase. If you know how much hashing power the card has, and what its power draw is, it is trivial to determine at what point your miner will no longer be profitable.

This is **not** a predictive model of when on the calendar your device will be obsolete, however. And one thing you may notice about the inclusion of the BTCUSD price in this model is that as BTCUSD goes up so will the costs of operation go down. If your power is cheaper than $0.15 or even free, it could last for a little while yet.

However, to give you a glimpse inside my crystal ball as it were, my models would suggest that a 7970 will be obsolete in the third or fourth week in April if BTCUSD were to maintain at $90 and power costs at $0.15/kWh.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jn0cn/yes_you_can_get_your_refund_from_bfl_through/

Except that I used my credit card through paypal directly to pay BFL.  Paypal did not hold any funds, just brokered the transaction.

*  I sent a polite and short email to office@butterflylabs.com requesting a full refund due to lack of promise &amp; product in a timely fashion. 

I was denied (within 24 hours) and told that units were already shipping in a short canned response.  (They are still in July of 2012 and my order was in February 2013)

* The next day, I filled out an online fraudulent charge on my Paypal account explaining that this request was only because the buyer was refusing to handle the matter directly.

This immediately got closed because of the 45 day window that Paypal has.  

* Now, Paypal had my date stamps from the questionable purchase and the date I posted the fraudulent charge.  I called Paypal directly &amp; referred to the recent fraud charge that I am persuing.  

I did have to explain my story.  They do have a 45 day window for ""Pre-Orders"" but this was ""Pre-Production"".  Which Paypal should never have backed.  This is where my story forks from the sticky post.

* I used my credit card (visa) through Paypal with no funds in my Paypal account.  Paypal immediately told me that I would have to contact my card and issue a charge-back from my card to Paypal.

I took a moment and repeated the scenario that the Paypal agent just described.  ""You want me to file a charge back from my card to Paypal?  I have no problems with the Paypal service and do not want to be in bad standing with Paypal""

* The Paypal agent assured me that this was the procedure and once issued Paypal and my Visa card would work together.  Once my Visa card issued a charge-back, then Paypal can bypass their 45 day window of charge-back to the seller and lawyers would get involved and I was not at fault, but the victim, if I truthfully had not received my product.

So this ended my communication with Paypal.  I had a notepad at this point of the charges/dates in question, the dates/contacts of emails and case numbers.

* Now, we are about 4 days in, I contact my Visa company and explain the situation.  Give them the dates that Paypal*BFLabs were charged.  The agent also sounded hesitant about charging back Paypal.  I explained that it was only to start the process and that Paypal would work directly with them.  I gave my Visa agent the Paypal case number and they contacted Paypal while I was on hold.

I have been with my card company for 15+ years.  I have never once filed a charge-back and been in great standing with them.  

* The Visa agent came back and told me that they were initiating the charge-back.  They also stated that they are pro-rating my card the amount of the charge.  They would mail me paperwork within a week to have a paper copy.  To keep my invoice and any information I had on my order.

http://web.archive.org/web/20130123144425/http://www.butterflylabs.com/ I love this website. This was the last page before my order was placed.

* So the day I receive the letter in the mail from my Visa card, Paypal and BFLabs (within a minute of each other) send me an email notifying me of status change to my account.  I log in to Paypal and I have the option to remove my charge-back if I have received the product or filed it in error.  I log in to BFL and it says my order is complete.  I now have a new tab on my account for ""Invoices"" and for ""Refunds""

**By the way, on BFL website, there are new Invoice &amp; Refund numbers different from the Order number.  My Invoice (Which says completed) number is ~250 (is this how many orders have really been shipped?) and my Refund number is ~4700 (how many people have successfully gotten refunds?)**

* I am in a holding pattern at the moment.  I have not seen a credit back or any activity from Butterfly Labs or Paypal other than the emails and these new invoice number &amp; refund numbers on my BFL account.  


At this point I feel better.  BFL never had the intention of filling their orders efficiently for the public.  I hope more people keep following suit.  This is my story and I am still in limbo right now.  Please ask me any questions or suggestions about your situation and I will try to relate it to mine.

(n00b here) I preemptively pulled the trigger on the $275 BFL mining box on April 19th before seeing hundreds of posts about them not delivering after months of promises. So, my question is should I request a refund? I've heard that they have no problem processing refunds, so should I get my money back and spend it on a GPU rig I can have up and running by this weekend or should I ride it out and hope the influx of BFL boxes doesn't drive down the cost effectiveness of mining? I am seeing that they started shipping at the end of last week, but I have read where people submitted orders as early as 9 months ago and they'd be the first ones to receive.

Honestly, it's all of the profit I've gotten from buying and selling my bitcoins, so the cash doesn't really matter that much to me, but if there is a better way to get a good ROI sooner, I'd rather explore that path.

Combined they run around 760M/hash.  One is my main desktop and one is specifically built for mining. I've been doing it for a month or so now and have about 380 dollars in my Dwolla.  So I figure I'm doing alright!

Then the electricity bill came.  It's DOUBLE what it was when I started this. So I went out and bought a Watt meter and tested all my rigs and network equipment and it comes out to 772 Watts total. 

    772 / 1000 = .772 kWh
    .772 x 24hr = 18.528 kWh/Day
     18.528 x .148 (price of electricity for me per kWh) = $2.74 a day
      $2.74 x 30 days = $82.26 a month

$82 in electricity a MONTH. I'm making around 13 btc a month which means about $50 a month profit if you disregard difficulty increases.  (Which would be stupid to do.) 

If difficulty forces me down to anything less than .3 btc a day or the price drops below 8, it's time to shut down the miners.

I also am hoping for some feedback on the GPU choices I have shown. Are there any other better options out there for mining using a GPU? It seems that you can't really mine long enough to break even before the ASIC's come out and make it unprofitable. Though, you can mine now, and once it becomes unprofitable, sell the GPU for for probably more than half the original price which would cut down the time to break even quite a bit.

Also, I uploaded the chart so anyone who wishes to use better prices they found elsewhere or different power costs can do so. If mega is a bad option for anyone tell me what file host you need! Hopefully this will be of use to someone.

I'd be happy even if this helped at least one other person in not getting ripped off for what is probably a very large amount of money.

This was new to me as this was my first pre-order purchase on eBay, but I did some researching and I found [this page](http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/pre-sale.html) that describes eBay's policy on pre-order purchases. There's a lot of text, so I just want to highlight the main points. 

Basically, you are protected by eBay (and PayPal if you paid with it), but the window is not open for very long. Ebay says that **items must be available to ship within 30 days of the payment being made**. From the day you made the payment, you have **45 days to open a case with eBay if you didn't receive the item and get your money back**.

So unless your order date was very early, you will most likely not be receiving your miner within 30 days or even 45 days of making the purchase. After 45 days, there is nothing eBay or PayPal can do to help you, even if the seller decides to not send the miner to you. Now this is only my advice, but **I would strongly recommend not going outside the 45 day window**, in hopes of getting your miner, especially with ROI decreasing by the day. Do this only if you can afford to lose the money you spent. 

This is just to make everyone aware of eBay's policies and that there may still be time to get your money back if you're still within the 45 day window. This helped me get my money back and hopefully it will be useful to some of you.

**TL;DR**: You can safely buy pre-order spots on eBay, but just know **the seller has 30 days from when you make the payment to ship the miner to you**.

I've been dipping my toe into Bitcoin mining for the past few months and, as a software developer, couldn't help but start writing some code to make things easier for myself.

One of the tools I developed is an Open Source graphical miner that runs on Windows, OS X, and Linux. It was originally written specifically to allow mining separate coins on each individual device on a machine and has grown from there.

It uses either cgminer or bfgminer as an underlying engine and supports features such as mining the most profitable coin, restarting dead/sick miners, and remotely monitoring and controlling your rigs from your mobile phone.

I love me some Reddit but I've held off on posting anything until now because - well let's face it - Redditors can be c̶r̶u̶e̶l̶ brutally honest. However I've spent enough time fine tuning things and creating source code samples and I'm ready for some wider exposure.

So if you've got some minutes and some rigs, have a look at [MultiMiner](http://multiminerapp.com) and let me know what you think. The official forum thread can be found [here](http://thread.multiminerapp.com).

People have shown interest in a Reddit mining co-op but seem to fight over what company should be used to mine; KnC, BFL, Avalon, etc. So this divides the overall size potential of each mining pool to their respective followers. But the smaller the pool, the less money in it, the less money to buy top of the line gear, less money earned.

_____________________________________________________________
**Here's what I'm proposing**. 

I don't want to run this myself, look at the bottom for info on that.


Have three different wallet addresses for the three different companies; one for BFL, one for KnC, and one for Avalon. In the case of no-ships this would simplify refunds. All the funds received from each wallet would be used to purchase that/those machines. Now that's where the division ends. Someone who paid for a KnC share would receive the same as someone who paid for a BFL share upon payout from received machines regardless of how much each hashes. This mitigates risk as in the case of no ship your share would still be worth something if you choose not to take your refund(which could then be used by the moderator of the pool to buy more hardware). 



Also, a lot of people are selling their chips that BFL gave them for less than face value. I propose allowing chips to be given in return for shares(or a fragment, we could figure out the worth of a share and chip later) if we could get someone to put them together. 



To run this I propose: collaborate with /u/MarcusOrlyius who originally posted the thread that got me interested(I've sent him a message, waiting for a reply) as well as /u/didhejust, the creator of /r/teamredditmining and see if we can merge all the different miners into one pool.

**TLDR: I offer to visit them in China and purchase the minimum quantity myself. They dodge my questions and respond with copypasta**

Here is my communication with them:
&gt;Hello ASX Project,
Your project is ambitious and noteworthy.
I am very interested, and am willing to purchase up to 20 of your +5 150 GH/s systems. But I need to know that your business is legitimate. I would like to meet your team in China, or have one of my Chinese family members do so.
Please get in touch with me.

They generally ignored my request to visit in person:

&gt;Dear Zenmagnets,
It seems it would be a good option to do so. Please let us know what kind of additional information would satisfy you. We have however very limited information in terms of pictures/videos, as we have only tested one module on-site with the supplier. We fully intend to produce and ship the products to our clients. The accusations on bitcointalk are untrue and unjustified.

So I asked again:

&gt;ASXproject,
To start, you should start using your names, instead of just the ASXproject moniker. I would like to meet with somebody within the next 3 days. So please give me your project leader's name, phone, and address. I can purchase the MOC of 100 modules myself, if I am convinced this is legitimate. Please respond asap.

And they responded with absolute copypasta:

&gt;Dear Zenmagnets,
We are aware of the concerns in the bitcoin community. The concern as to the images used is justified as the ASIC chip is indeed an example of a future product-part. The case, and heatsink parts will be used in our finished product. We will re-test and film the working ASIC module this week and post it on our website. Our product is basically a remake of the Avalon, however there are more chips on the modules which requires a slightly different control unit, PDU etc. The testing does, however not demonstrate a finished product whatsoever.

&gt;Our supplier has already shown the capability of producing the required hardware. Thus, we feel confident in our combined ability to reach the set goals. Though, it seems that the purchasing of products at our website is diminishing. Therefore, it seems meaningful to address the community regarding its concerns. We will dedicate our time to update and provide additional information for the coming period. 

&gt;We will keep you posted. Any suggestions regarding efforts from our side towards helping this project reach its potential are very welcome.

I've been reading this subreddit for a few weeks now (currently mining on old pc 5870 with live miner). But it struck me that this subreddit does have very little information in it's sidebar. Sure it says this is the place to be for ASIC, but finding actually feedback from users or a FAQ on them is pretty hard.

So my question: what's up with ASIC, are they worth the purchase? Which ones do you think will actually deliver their systems? Anybody that has actual contact with some of these guys? Having some inside sources on these kind of things never hurts. I didn't mind waiting a huge ass long time on my raspberry pi, but that was another thing. 
I really like crypto, mining, bitcoins and all the things that come lurking around with it, but I feel that I might be a tad bit too late. I hope to still get in to some ASIC mining if possible and get a proper breakeven with the ASIC if possible.

So what ASIC's are on the market? Which ones will most likely deliver? Best dollar/hashrate, ... And why is this not all in the sidebar? :( (at least put up some calculator for bitcoinming in it, having to go to /r/bitcoin just for the calc is annoying :( )

We would like to announce the beginning of our reward based reseller program. Anyone can become a registered reseller of our devices. The rewards are simple, for every 10 sales of one individual device you will receive one of the same items for free. For example, provide us with 10 Jupiter sales and we will ship you a complete Jupiter free of charge. Sell 10 Saturn’s and we will ship you a Saturn free of charge the same applies for Mercury devices.
 
It’s that simple!
 
To register as a reseller simply contact info@kncminer.com . We will then provide you with a reseller ID, and then all you have to do is get people to click on a special link in the format of
 
https://www.kncminer.com/?resellerid=xxx Where xxx = your reseller ID number.
 
You are free to advertise your own personal link on any site/forum/portal you wish. We will soon be providing an online report where you can view your sales, but for now please contact info@kncminer.com and we can provide you with a sales report.
We will also be providing sample banners and images shortly. All registered resellers will receive a copy of the banners when available.
 
November pricing
 
With difficulty increasing the way it is, we would like to give an indication of a November price drop. Currently all orders placed and paid for will ship in October, and yes, we still have space within October for more orders. However, as soon as this is no longer the case we will adjust our prices for November accordingly.
 
To give you an indication on the forthcoming price drop a Jupiter device will cost less than 5000 USD. More information will follow on this when October shipping becomes full.
 
Development progress
 
While we wait for the chips to finish production, we have some news on the development progress, and it’s good news. We have been continuously testing our design to get the best out of the chips. We would like to say, that while the spec of Jupiter will remain a guaranteed minimum 400 GH/s we can confirm that we are expecting to be over that mark by a considerable margin.
 
Hosting update
Hosting has become quite popular and we are filling up fast for September and October devices. Space is becoming limited, so for those of you wanting to host with us we recommend you order hosting as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.
 
Pre-Configuration Options
 
There has been a small update made to our webshop. You will now have the option to enter your Pool preferences with wallet address and/or worker Name ID. We would like to invite all customers who wish to preconfigure their devices to return to the site, login to our shop and enter your details. The new fields can be found under the “my account” page.For people with orders of multiple devices who wish to preconfigure, you can enter one [worker name] we will then add _[xx]  which will be automatically configured on all of your devices before they leave our factory. This means that all you have to do is plug them in and walk away.
 
Upgrade removal
 
For people wishing to take advantage of our current upgrade process you have one more week left, as of next Friday this option will no longer be available to any customers.

Oh wait. That ain't good. Still no update from mfg. No tracking #. Site actually still shows my order as processing. If they prove skeptics wrong, I'll update it.
**newest TL; DR: Don't be ""that guy."" Don't order from ASX Project.** 

7/28/13: I admit I was feeling a bit uneasy about this Avalon clone ASIC miner order I made with ASX Project. The ""resources"" on Bitcoin Talk still sees this as a straight scam. I actually emailed the company a letter reminding them about karma due to a lack of progress/updates for the 2 days past their shipping date. 

It was money I can afford to lose, but hell, who likes to lose money on a calculated gamble? To be honest I was about ready to write it off (and still willing to write off) with maybe a token complaint to a Shenzhen anti-corruption agency of some sort. I don't have a tracking # yet but man it'd be a helluva coup if a newbie like me can come online in the next week or two with 50GH out of left field. ETA? &lt;shrug&gt; Will update as it progresses, I did ask for a tracking #. 

Planning on immediately ordering 3 more modules to nearly triple my hash rate to 125GH if I see it running without too many errors/issues for 24 hours. 25Gh/s Modules sell for $300. FWIW: I'm so new my 1st ever mining equipment: a BFL Jally arrives Mon.

**TL;DR: N00b takes a gamble on $1K 50GH/s Avalon ASIC clone ~2 weeks ago: allegedly shipping. It's still Caveat Emptor until someone has vid/photos of ASX Project miners in the wild**

So there has been a lot of talk about FPGA and ASIC miners recently, and I've been doing some of my own research. FPGA's are fully programmable, and mainly used in R&amp;D where ASIC's cannot be programmed - but are cheap and have the potential to out preform FPGA's. 

Here's where it gets interesting. There are multiple companies that do FPGA-to-ASIC migrations for this exact purpose. The ""R&amp;D lab"" has a stable setup with their FPGA and want to get it into production. It would make little sense to use expensive and slower FPGA's, especially when the code (HDL) has been finalized. This is where these migration companies come in...

Now this is what I'm thinking, we already have the Open-Source FPGA Bitcoin Miner HDL - so what's stopping us with going into full production mode and getting our OWN ASIC's???

I've come across multiple companies that do this (it seems pretty common practice) such as this one that even offers pin compatibility which would make our lives even easier: http://www.gigoptix.com/component/k2/item/325-pin-pin.html

Any input is welcomed! I haven't messed around with FGPA's in 13 years so I'm probably off on a few things. Feel free to fill in the holes!

The tl;dr of it is that the US Government views people as Money Transmitters (and therefore MSBs) if they mine BTC and then convert that BTC into a traditional currency (USD, EUR, etc.).  Based on my interpretation of it, if you simply buy BTC or receive BTC from goods or services provided you can exchange that for traditional currency as normal.  Also, if you mine BTC and use it to purchase goods or services you do not have to register as an MSB.

Registering as an MSB requires a LOT of money and hassle and requires you to keep records for a long time, making it very unattractive for a casual or even serious miner.

I currently work as a developer (ruby, js, etc) but have little-to-no experience with hardware, and don't know what to look for. From what I understand, bitcoin is well past the point where throwing a few old laptops and towers together would do anything, but I'm not exactly trying to spend $5k either. Hardware requirements for successful mining seem to be getting more demanding by the day, so it's hard to find relevant info on the web.

If I were willing to part with $1000-1200 max, what would you recommend I check out? Would I even be able to break-even? What type of things should I look for/avoid?

   Im looking to invest into a ASIC, but just wondered if its going to be worth it for me and what i can expect and some other opinions. 
  I was looking at investing in either a bitfury or KNC. Now there is a big speed difference between the cheapest models (25GH BF - $1,300, KNC -100GH $2000) both shipping in Oct. 
I can see the following

BF - working prototype with chip, low power, high cost per GH

KNC - Low cost per GH, havent seen working prototype, havent seen working anything..
 
Now I live in Australia and pay .27 a KWH which also needs to be factored in, and i understand the difficulty will skyroket, my question is with all the devices coming online in the next few months - would it be wise to buy or will i never make ROI?. i would be happy with a ROI of 12 months, but with my high power costs and high difficulty i think it may not be worth it.
does anyone know the projected difficulty with the amount of TH coming online in the next few months (avalon chips/BF/KNC/AM) etc?

the main reason for me doing one of these rather than a share in another one is i love playing with hardware also, would love to have my own.

TL:DR - should i buy a KNC or BF or neither?

1. Does it make sense to invest in an ASIC miner right now? Will I be able to make up the money in a reasonable amount of time and start turning a profit soon?

1.How long do you guys mine for each day?

2.How long did it take for you to make your first full btc?

3.I read somewhere that mining would be dead in 1 or 2 months, (that blog being posted in February) is that correct?

4.I only have a 7870 and I have 330Mhash/s, what can I expect out of that?

5.I've read a lot of people giving other people advice saying you need 3 or 4 gpu's other wise you are only covering energy &amp; fee prices, is that true?

6.With a rig like mine, single 7870, how much energy would it be costing me a day?

7.As of right now, I have 602 accepted shares &amp; 3 stale/invalid. What does this mean?

The version of phatk I'm using is 2.2, but upgrading didn't really have any noticable effect.

My video card is only overclocked to 1GHz and the core voltage is at 1187 mV (just 2 notches higher than default in Afterburner). The mem clock is at 225 MHz.

I just figured that worst case, the money was gone really...  lo and behold, it arrived about 3 weeks ago, let me briefly share a few things, as some of my tinkering and experiments may benefit others:

- I got the non-heatpipe heatsink version, standard edition (5gh I think is the marketed speed?)... did not pay for the upgrade to 7... 
- Unboxed and plugged in, I averaged out around 5.4gh and temps in the low 40s (41-43).. the thing sounded like a jet engine.  No, seriously, I would have 3 systems going, and that little box was the loudest thing in the room.
- At those rates, I ran the numbers, and determined my ROI period was 18 days.  (My total out of pocket was $163, pre price hike).  My plan was to mine back what I needed in BTC to pay for the device, plus a little extra (1.8 BTC was my total target).. then I started hearing about things one could do to push it a little further (remove from case, better fan, firmware upgrade to push faster, etc)...  so I spent about $100 in parts (jtag programer, cable, torx bit, etc) and decided once my 1.8BTC was mined, it was open season on the hardware, warranty be damned... purely for science you understand.  
- Meanwhile I started accumulating orders for a couple Block Erupter USBs for ~1BTC each, because hashrate is a dangerous drug.   I also tossed in a Raspberry Pi, case, some other odds and ends (powered usb hub, etc), with the intent to power down my watt guzzling GPU rig entirely, instead of it sitting there running just to feed the ASICs..

This past weekend I opened the little black box of mystery and had some fun:

- Tore down, removed the heatsink.  They used thermal pads that are not adhesive on the heatsink side, so I was able to remove HS without tearing the pads any.  That said, repeated removal and putting it back, I think you run the risk of them tearing over time (I have a couple small tears in mine when I took it off the first time)..
- I added some copper heatsinks (think Raspberry Pi heatsinks...) to the mosfest and a few other areas of the board that (to me) seemed to run hot.
- Replaced the stock fan (I'd heard the horror stories of fans breaking) with a low profile Noctua (92mm fan for anyone who is pondering), and flipped the fan over to blow down into the heatsink.
- I flashed the firmware to the stock 1.25 firmware that's floating around..  They say you need to watch that the chips don't overheat while you have it powered up to flash as you can't put the heatsink and the flash cable on at the same time.. I'll admit, I constructed a leaning tower of cooling (remember those little bronze heatsinks I mentioned? two of them right on top of the ASICS, OEM heatsink propped on top to hold them down) while I jtagg'd the microcontroller, and I was still very worried about heat (cable up everything except power, mouse over the ""Erase!"" button in jtag software, power up BFL, smash Erase... chips go idle... load the firmware image, push ""Load"", as soon as the LED started showing activity (chips powered!) I ripped the power back out.
- I did all this in one sitting... maybe an hour total, most of that checking it out the inside and pondering what I was about to do.

I plugged everything back in, powered up my host... and noticed my jally was just flashing like crazy and my host couldn't see it. uh-oh.  I powered it off, back on, and it was fine.  Since then I've powered it off about 10-20 times, and twice it would go into ""super fast flash like crazy but not work"" mode. Simply unplugging and replugging would solve it. I have not dug into this at all, but I think it's failing to init or pass the boot up tests. There's word around town that you can tweak the firmware to push speed further or reduce the strictness of the tests it does, but I'm happy with what I've got, so I'm leaving it:

[Right now](http://imgur.com/ksUYqFS)

Other than to change coins or work on my host system (now that it's a raspberry pi I don't think I'll be changing it much more), it's been running non-stop at around that rate/temp since the weekend.

Right now my little rPi host is bashing away, with the jally and three block erupters (I know they'll most likely never reach ROI for themselves by themselves, I just wanted to tinker, but still may add a couple more to break 10Gh total just for bonus points), the jally firmware ""upgrade"" everyone talks about is really designed for one of the other models (the bigger ones), and that's why I think it reports as ""BFL 0h"" or ""BFL 0d"" I assume ""d"" and ""h"" are the two ASIC spots on the jally board that actually have chips on them in the jally...

I figure all in I'm looking at around... lets say $650 and 90 watts (max) total for ~8.29Gh/s...  The erupters really distort my numbers right now, (without them it'd be more like $350 and 80 watts (max) for ~7.3Gh/s)... but again, hashrate is addictive.

The jally power supply has always seemed to run hot to me, even before I pushed the update firmware, so I may try and find a bigger/better quality PS for it, and more erupters will sadly mean I need a new usb hub, as my current one is only rated for 5v 2A, and it has to be close to that with 3 erupters, the pi, and the usb fan. :/  So I guess I've still got more investment to go, but it's just a hobby, I can quit anytime, right?

right?




tl;dr edition (or what I learned, without the story):

- Yes, the jally is loud, remove the case, flip the fan.  Your temp will drop and (with a new quiet fan atleast, I can't vouch for the oem fan), it's much quieter.  Use the ""top"" of the case as the new ""bottom"", and leave the sides and top off.

- Yes, ASICs can mine alt-coins provided they are sha256 and don't change too much.  I've done TRC, PPC, and FRC with the BFL/Erupter setup... I found one SHA256 recently that choked with rejects, I can't remember the name, but it was one of the recent new SHA256 based coins.

- Yes, there's a firmware out there you can flash the Jally with to open it up from 5gh to the 7gh -&gt; 8gh range.  The 7gh model has (I believe), just a version of this newer firmware, no better chips necessarily , so if you buy the 7gh upgrade, you are probably not going to push it to 10g or something crazy with the firmware.. note that doing this does void your warranty as far as BFL is concerned.

Is there any way to have my bitcoin mining work the same way?  Right now, I'm using Guiminer with poclbm and the ufasoft CPU miner.  I'm only running a GeForce 460 and I have a combined hashrate of a mere 75-80 MH/s.

Its free money, as far as I'm concerned.

But since I don't plan on buying hardware only for mining, and I like to actually USE my computer sometimes, I have to shut off the GPU mining or else I can't play games and sometimes even Windows will suddenly slow to a crawl.  So I stop mining while I'm using it, but then forget to start it again when I go to bed, class, or work.

- CPU mining is basically not worthwhile anymore. Unless you have a ton of computers sitting around idle? Such as a system admin of a school who can run a miner on a large number of computers during non-school hours.

- GPU mining is almost one foot out the door.  If you have equipment already you might as well use it; but the days of going out and running 4+ GPUs are no longer worth it due to initial costs and power consumption?

- FPGA - I haven't been able to dig up much of information, i found one vendor that said they suspended production due to declining demand.  I've only seen a few people talk about using them, but it seems like not many people adopted this?

- ASIC - this is the current top dog, but there is a very limited supply.  Avalon's 3rd batch sold out in ~30min and they cost 75BTC,  people have said Avalon isn't going to do a 4th batch.

- Butterfly labs has been selling per-orders for ~5-6 months now, and none have shipped?  Most people say this is a scam or will never come to market and people will get a refund at best.  If they did ever materialize at the specifications stated they would be worth while because of the lower cost and power consumption compared to the Avalon.

If Butterfly labs does ship; or if Avalon does a 4th batch, and either option takes 2-3 months to ship and arrive at the door, would it be too late for new miners to jump on the ASIC bandwagon?  I seems like mining is a race to get the newest equipment first and cashing out the initial investment early.

Is this a good summary of the current state of bit mining, or am i completely off?

I'm looking at getting into mining; however i feel like I'm so far behind the ASIC wagon that if i did get a ASIC system, it would take a long time to break even and ""the next best thing"" might be out by then?

Questions and Concerns,TheGadgetCat,10,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1bj950/help_looking_to_get_started_questions_and_concerns/,"So, I'm at school, and I'm going to be in the dorms next year. I mainly use my laptop for my work / play, but I have a desktop back home that was my rig before I came here. I was thinking about ripping out the NVidia GTS 250 and putting in a card or two for bitcoin / litecoin mining. It sports an AMD Athlon II X4 CPU @ 2.6GHz and 8GB RAM with a 650W PSU. I was thinking about putting a 7970 or two in. I know that there are other cards, but this would allow it to fall back as a great gaming rig if mining doesn't turn out. The plan was also to set up some liquid cooling to keep it from running too hot. I think this investment would be around $1500 max (This includes some money for an initial direct investment in bitcoins / litecoins). 

I have done a bit of research for the past few days on this, and I'm a bit hesitant to get started. The cost of power is no concern, so I'm guaranteed to make SOME money. Even if it takes a year for me to break even, that's okay. However, I know that a lot of people are saying NOT to get into bitcoin mining due to the new ASIC miners coming out that are going to fuck the difficulty for GPU rigs. I also hear a lot of people saying that getting into Litecoin mining is an alternative due to it's low hash rate requirement. However, won't ASICs also screw the difficulty here as well, despite it being very low right now (compared to bitcoins)?

Last concern I have is that I want to try out litecoin mining a bit first. However, my gaming laptop isn't cooled very efficiently, and it is currently my only machine besides my phone. It has a 7970M and an i7 Ivy Bridge. I did some bitcoin mining just to test speeds, and the 7970M would pull 320 - 350 Mh/s which isn't awful. However, the temps would get upwards of 90C, and the CPU while litecoin mining would get to about 89C with only 1.5 Mh/s. Now I may be wrong, but this seems too hot. I tested these temps against the load from Hitman: Absolution, and while it wasn't quite maxed, it would still run the temp up to about 90C. I've played this and many other high demand games for over a year, and have had no issues. How safe would it be for me to run some litecoin mining on this laptop?

Rundown: 

If I'm not paying for power, would a ~$1500 investment in a mining rig be a smart idea for bitcoin / litecoin mining?

Is this planned rig even a good idea, or should I be going for the less available but more efficient cards?

Have I missed the boat entirely and is bitcoin / litecoin mining just not a good idea in general anymore?

Would it be safe for my laptop to run some litecoin mining on it for short 1hour spurts?

From my knowledge, BitCoin Mining doesn't use any CPU. I went with an APU build because of the MOBO supporting 7 SATA 3 ports. I can then fill up the ports with HDD's for my server. It also supports RAID5, which I will be using. This MOBO also supports 3-way CF, which is a plus. I will be putting everything in WC. 

Is there anything that might get changed?

Also if anybody is wondering why I am putting 7950's in a mining rig, my friend is away and has entrusted me with his computer. He didn't want to sell it. So I took his GPU's put it in my main rig, and put my 7950's to use.

I was thinking that I could try and make a little bit of cash off of GPU mining before all of this happens, and was planning on buying a pair of secondhand 5850s to mine a bit.  Just before ASIC hits, I'll try and sell them off and get into ASIC mining. 

Here's the actual question - I currently have a 4850X2 and two more PCIe x16 slots available.  Is it possible to run the two 5850s *and* the 4850X2 at the same time in my rig?  Does Catalyst even support cards from different generations in the same system?  The 5850s will be running independently, no CrossFire bridges or anything, just a couple of dummy cables so that they can mine.  I'm set for a PSU (the one that I used in my original build a couple of years ago is beautifully overpowered) and I have unlimited power at my university, but I just don't know if it's actually possible to do this.

I suggest you use linux on your mining rig, you can download LinuX MinT here:
http://www.linuxmint.com/download.php

next you need to download: http://ck.kolivas.org/apps/cgminer/cgminer-3.3.4-x86_64-built.tar.bz2

extract, go to its folder, right click and press ""open in terminal"" and typ ""./cgminer""

Next register here: https://mining.bitcoin.cz/accounts/register/

After registration you should find your worker name &amp; password

In the CGminer terminal window, type this when prompted for URL stratum.bitcoin.cz:3333

then type in your username (workername) and then your password.

You can automate this process by typing ""./cgminer -o stratum.bitcoin.cz:3333 -u workername -p password""

If you have an ATI card like me you probably want to overclock and adjust fan speed, you can do this with these commands:

aticonfig --od-enable (Enables ATI Overdrive)

aticonfig --od-setclocks=coreclock,memclock --adapter=num (Coreclock=Coreclock, Memclock=Memoryclock, num=0,1,2 or all where 0 is default)

aticonfig --pplib-cmd ""set fanspeed 0 100"" (Sets fanspeed to 100%, recommended)

This command checks the clock
aticonfig --odgc --adapter=all


And this one temperature:
aticonfig --odgt --adapter=all

Stabalize your clock speed and temperature and try to enjoy this difficult process of mining bitcoins.

I've tried changing pools.  Re-Booting.  Update/Upgrade even - nothing.  The unit spins up to the 1.3 GH/sec on both the LCD and the mining pool's stats - but will then degrade to &lt;300 (again via the mining pools and not the LCD.)

   2) Asus Radeon 7770
* ATI catalyst 12.3
* BFGminer 3.0.2
* 2 display monitors
(anymore info please ask will gladly reply)

Ok so here is the situation. I have 2 displays hooked up to my Asus 7770 ports, run bfgminer i get an average of ~300Mh/s. Both cards are working, Ok that good! Yay

When i switch the display port of both monitors from the Asus 7770 to the XFX 5750 ports, run bfgminer, my hash rates drops to ~180 Mh/s. Essentially only my 5750 is doing the work  Wtf? 0_o


 In the [screenshot link](http://imgur.com/kqcZQeC) i have provided my Asus 770 is labeled ""OCL 0"" and the XFX 5750 is labeled ""OCL 1"". 
The OCL 0 only 1 thread is BARELY working and the other thread is paused. The OCL 1 is working at full. 


So what helpful configurations do i need to activate the threads on my Asus 7770 (OCL 0) to get my hash rates back up to my average 300Mh/s??

With LTC mining being reported as less profitable than BTC mining, I changed an older rig (Win 7 x64, cgminer 3.0.1, Catalyst 12.8, 2GB version 6950) over to BTC to see what the differences were. I signed up with the [BTC Guild](https://www.btcguild.com/) and chose PPLNS because this reward scheme worked well in LTC-land, and in a few minutes the pool was reporting an accurate hashrate for the worker.

cgminer is running with only the pool and worker parameters because I haven't read tuning methodologies for BTC mining. The GPU is currently reporting 354 Mh/s, 99.1% shares accepted, but only a work utility of 4.9/m. BTC Guild reports 379.04 Mh/s and 99.07% shares accepted. The [allchains calculator](http://allchains.info/calc.html) estimates 0.016 BTC/day for 354 Mh/s but the rewards from BTC Guild are only averaging 0.011 BTC/day. Given that BTC Guild is reporting a higher hashrate, this lower reward is unexpected.

My initial questions are:

(1) Is there a recommended tuning guide for BTC mining? This GPU was performing really well with LTC mining and I'd like to make it more efficient for BTC.

(2) What would be causing, or contributing to, the significantly lower reward from BTC Guild?

What do you guys think?

3 cards would be $210, cpu+mobo+ram $200, psu $100. So just over $500 per machine. If I built quantity two three card machines, I could have ~2000Mh/s of power for about $1000. I'm estimating power consumption to be around 450W DC per rig. 400W for the cards, 50W for everything else.

I am currently making a spreadsheet to calculate if it is cost effective to buy Avalon chips and start mining. (hint: it is, even in the worst case scenario).  
As a worst case scenario I have set the rate of difficulty increases at 11 days, so there is an increase in difficulty of about 27% each time.

This is, in my opinion, not a realistic simulation, but it works fine as a worst case example.
What is your view for a realistic difficulty increase simulation?

Will the difficulty keep increasing in steps of 28%, do you think it will become less difficult, or do you think I am completely wrong and the difficulty will rise with steps far greater than 27%?

If there is any interest I can post the spreadsheet I made to calculate everything. I'll just have to translate it from Dutch.

Question is what stops a miner from submitting proof-of-works to a pool but in case they actually complete a block they secretly don't report that to a pool but report it to the network as a solo miner.

Kudos to 50btc.com for taking care of the issue and if you find that your GPU is being used while your PC is idle start by looking at the task manager as regular virus programs will no detect miners *yet*. Malware Bytes will tag cgminer and others as PUP (Potentially unwanted programs) but this is only on a full scan. Track down the offending exe and before you delete it run a wireshark and see where it is mining too.

I understand that ""when ASICs arrive"" it will change the entire mining ecosystem, but given the perpetual delays in shipping (at least from Butterfly Labs), I want to build my own GPU powered miner. I have about $4k USD to put into a system (or multiple systems if that's a better idea) and I'd like it to hit at least 3.5 Gigahash/s. So here's my questions:

1) To keep the machine viable as long as possible, it needs to be power efficient. The numbers I've seen on the new 7990 put it at about 1.2 Ghash for 375 watts of consumption (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison and http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-hd-7990-review-benchmark,3486.html) - 3.2 Mhash/watt. Would I see better efficiency numbers from a different card?

2) I understand that mining does not require the card to be in a full speed PCIe slot to get optimal hashing power. If I use a 7990, is the fact that it is a Dual-GPU card going to require more than a 1x PCIe slot? Or, more specifically, how much bandwidth does hashing require per Mhash/s? The answer to that question leads to the last question - 

3) If I build a setup with a backplane for additional PCIe slots, how many slots could I realistically add before Windows 7 Ultimate x64 fails to recognize the devices or otherwise derps out? I'm not against setting up with a Linux based system, I just haven't seen appropriate drivers available on that platform. (Side note - do I NEED Catalyst drivers to run an OpenCL miner?)

I don't know if its novel or not, but it seems that the only way to get into the game at this point is with a lot of money for specialized hardware.  Which we don't have.  Nonetheless, we are interested by the idea of crowd-sourcing the funds to buy a large number of ASIC units and splitting the costs and profits among the ""subscribers.""  We can keep some funds off the top to sustain the rig as mining difficulty increases.

Our questions for you all are:

* Has this been attempted before?
* What are your initial thoughts on plausibility?
* Platform to organize - Kickstarter? Indiegogo?
* If I wanted to buy a dozen or so BFL or Avalon units, when would I get them at this point?

At most 1 - 3 BTC if I could get it in a week or two and I'd get out of the mining game. 

If I mine for 24 hours am I going to take a year off my GPU's life or something crazy? In which case it certainly doesn't seem worth it for a couple dollars at most. Will even short-term use put serious wear on my system? I'm not overclocking... is it really only the heat that's a concern or the cycles etc as well? If I run my mining for 1 hour on, give it a 10 min cooldown, run for another hour etc would this help at all?

I should also mention that when trying earlier I was getting some artifacts (black boxes flickering on the screen) while mining, so i was a bit worried that even a couple of minutes of mining was stretching my GPU to the breaking point.... but after some research this seems to be a known AMD thing.

Great thing is if all this goes kaput, I'll at least be able to resell it all! :D

I have a monitor around for initial setup, and all the other obvious peripherals.
What I am in need of are some tips or links in setting these 2 guys up. I'm somewhat new to Building a PCI-E Rig, but I'm sure its just as simple as plugging it all in, which I've done countless times before.
I know that if I'm on Linux I won't need any dummy plugs for the DVI outputs on the other cards for it to be recognized by the OS. Can it be run purely all on a USB drive? That's one thing I'm a little unsure of.

Mostly my questions consist of:

* Physical Setup, if there's anything special about it all. Obviously I'll need some cooling going on. Would fan-cooling be sufficient? Or should I look into Watercooling? All I know is that if I do watercooling, I'll have to get specific water blocks for my cards.. But where to get them? 
* Any particular settings while using the miner program on linux to max out the performance on my 2x 7970's and 3x 7770's
* Do you gain parts of bitcoins when you SoloMine, like you do in pooled mining? Or do you only reap a benefit when you hit a block of 25 bitcoins?

I don't care much for people bantering about how difficult it is now to mine, or how ineffective this might be, I've read my share about that. I plan on just having this run in the corner of my little apartment for a few months while I go to school/work/walk the dog/etc... I would like tips or any insider info on other fellow 7970'ers on how to maximize my performance with these two cards at my disposal. And of course those who do help me in my time of need and once it's all beautiful and vampiric-sparkly like will get Brownie Points in the afterlife.

Last computer I built was back in 2004 so that I could play Half Life 2. And I was on a budget back then too. So I'm not too savvy with all this new cooling hardware and techniques as I've never had to deal with things that exceeded 4x AGP.

I'll post pictures and videos of all the fun I have with this adventure :D

**Update**

Thus far I have only received my two 7970's and boy do they look beastly. I've never held a card that manly before.

Everything came in! Goodness it's difficult to do a headless Linux Box! for sake of time, I think I'm just going to buy a cheap sata harddrive.

I have about 1,200 USD on me that I'm looking to invest into BitCoin. I'd be dissappointed if I lost this money, but would not go into financial hardship. For about a month I've been researching in my free time if BitCoin is worth the investment. If I had two AISCIS with 30GH/s it would be quite profitable. However after a few months around January - March the market will be flooded with people buying these ASIC-based miners and thus the difficulty will increase. But how much will it increase? I can't answer that, and that is a very large factor in deciding if I should invest into BitCoin. I'm not worried too much about the economy crashing or the value of BitCoin diminishing too much. I have good hopes for it. 

What do you guys think? If I have the cash should I invest? Electricity isn't a major deal for me. The main thing I am asking here is the difficulty. Is it possible to do analysis and predict what the difficulty will be?

I'm having trouble getting my Block Erupter to mine for me. I'm running Vista 32 bit (ugh) with CGMiner 3.3.0. I think I have the drivers installed and I can see my device on COM3. I'm pretty much using a shortcut with the script below:

C:\cgminer\cgminer-nogpu.exe -o [pool]:[port] -u [username].[worker] -p [password] --icarus-options 115200:1:1 --icarus-timing 3.0=100 -S //./COM3

It just opens and crashes, though. When I try to run it in a command prompt it tells me

USB init, open device failed, err -12, you need to install a WinUSB driver for - AMU device 1:1  
Icarus detect (1:1) failed to initialise (incorrect device?)  
No devices detected!  
Waiting for USB hotplug devices or press q to quit

I'm using [this driver.](http://www.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/USBtoUARTBridgeVCPDrivers.aspx)

Where am I going wrong?

/edit: Basically I'm following [this guide](http://www.1a20.com/computers/easiest-way-to-setup-your-bitcoin-btc-usb-eruptor-asic-miner-333mhs-free/) because it's the only one I can find that offers help.

/edit edit: installed zadig and replaced the driver, and removed the -S //./COM3, and now I just get ""No devices detected!"" It's progress, but still not working. :(

/update 3: Switched to bfgminer and that seems to be working. Oddly enough, I'm showing 3 sets of hashes. it shows up something like 520/436/600Mh/s. I'm a little noobish yet with mining, so I'm not sure what this means. I only have one GPU and one Erupter. Why would I show 3 sets that high?

At the time of this post, the highest block was 244401.  

    highestBlock = 244401;
    lastAdj = floor(highestBlock / 2016); (243936)
    highestBlockTime = '2013-07-02 13:54:49 UTC';
    lastAdjTime = '2013-06-29 14:22:05 UTC';

As most of you know, Terrahash is rolling out pre-orders, and hopefully soon after will be shipping. One of their products is [This, the 18 terrahash modular board](http://terrahash.com/product/18-ghsec-modular-board/). After having seen [this](http://i.imgur.com/N97JZKa.jpg) I began to wonder if something similar would be achievable with the Terrahash modular board. My question comes down to power supply. It says on the website it uses PCI express for power, and my question is, is there some way to power the actual ASIC board from a wall, and then have it hook into the Raspberry pi via USB, in the same sense that the BFL does? I understand it also needs a USB cable, Cooling etc, but my main concern is about power. I know this is a stupid question, but I would like some Clarity.  

**EDIT:** What about Case options for one of these? I know it shouldn't be out in the open, but what Should I do for Keeping it somewhere Safe.. Computer Case? Racks?

I'm putting together a 4 GPU mining rig. I realize it is mostly pointless at this time but I have free hardware and free power.

Anyway, I need to use some PCIe slot extension cables [like these](http://cablesaurus.com/PCIe-x1--%3E-x16-Adapter-Extender-Cable-w-Molex-Connector) so I can spread the GPUs apart a bit.

I'm not in the US so ordering from Cablesaurus is not really practical, and they're out of stock anyway. I have found some cables locally but without molex power connectors on them.

My questions:

1. For x1 slots is it necessary to use [x1 to x16 cables](http://cablesaurus.com/PCIe-x1--%3E-x16-Adapter-Extender-Cable-w-Molex-Connector) or is it fine to use x1 to x1 cables? I ask because I have [seen photos](http://i.imgur.com/n5ffoQx.jpg) of rigs using x1 to x1 cables but most people seem to talk about x1 to x16 cables.

2. For x16 slots should I use an x16 to x16 cable? Does it make any difference to mining performance?

3. The cards I have here are HD6950 and HD6970 units. Is it safe to use them with these cables without having a molex power connector like the Cablesaurus ones have?

4. ~~Going back to [this photo](http://i.imgur.com/n5ffoQx.jpg) again, he has a DVI/VGA dongle there with some resistors in it. Is this also necessary? Any help with this would be appreciated too.~~ Answered.

Am I right?,GeoKangas,6,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1cpl0f/more_transactions_in_block_lower_hash_rate_fewer/,"I skimmed the wikipedia article on SHA-256.  The pseudo code seems to show that SHA-256's running time will be roughly O(n), where n is the number of 256-bit chunks in the input:

    initialize state
    for each chunk:
        scramble state, according to bits in chunk
    spit out digest, according to final state

This can't be parallelized, since the (i + 1)th state-scrambling needs the ith state as input.  So even with an ASIC, the running time is O(n).  Am I right so far?

As I understand it, the more transactions the miner includes in a block, the longer it gets.  In fact, transactions account for most of a typical block's length.

Let's say that a typical block is T times as long as a naked block (coinbase transaction only).  Won't a greedy miner get roughly T times the hash rate, and thus T times the BTC, by submitting naked blocks?  Can those 0.005 BTC transaction fees actually up the difference?

GPU 1: 59.0C 2814 RPM 614 Mh/s

So after a long time figuring out why GPU 0 was hotter and slower then the GPU 1 was due to the fact that it was on the inside of the motherboard... or it could just be something else. 

Had to take out the motherboard out of its case too so that might be a problem to why its not cooling enough, but my old 570 GTX ran about the same temperature as well.

I am currently running windows 7 premium 64 bit. The motherboard is a MSI 880G-E45, and I have used it to run 3 5830's in the past when running win XP 32 bit. The PCI-e slots are arranged as follows: 16x(runs at 1x because I tried using tape to force it to 1x), 1x (covered by 1st card), 1x(PCIe x1 extender attached to this), 1x(back cut out to allow 2nd card to be inserted onto mobo). The only real difference between this setup and when it was running XP is that when it was running XP the first 3 PCIe slots were all occupied by pciex1 extenders, leaving the 4th slot empty, but now the first, third, and fourth slot are occupied. When I try to boot up with a card attached to the 3rd slot via extender cable, the computer freezes at the windows boot screen, restarts, and then the bios says that a Hyper Transport Sync Flood Error has occurred. I don't know if it makes any difference, but the PCIEx16 slot is a 2.0 slot and I assume the x1 slots are all PCIE 1.0 because they are not listed as 2.0 in GPU-z, like the 16x slot is.

What works:
-Booting up in safe mode
-Booting up WITHOUT GPU drivers installed
-Booting up with PCI lock enabled, only 1st card works but the other two are detected with errors according to device manager
-Booting up with card removed from the 3rd slot
-All the GPUs work, I have tested them individually.
-I used tape on the card in the 16x slot to limit it to 1x

What I have tried that does not work/does nothing:
-Disabling clock frequencies to unused PCI slots
-Using the onboard GPU as primary
-Changing PCI latency timer
-Changing all clock frequencies in the bios to default values
-No GUI boot
-Booting without dummy plugs

How to objectively evaluate whether you should go ahead with this.,Subduction,5,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1kkkqa/a_post_for_newcomers_considering_mining_how_to/,"I wrote this as a comment in/u/reubadoob's post but I thought it might be useful to anyone just starting out in mining.

Clear, objective, and unemotional decisionmaking is the most important skill you need to bring to the process of looking at mining options.

Remember that gambles and risks need to have a possible upside to be a gamble or a risk, otherwise they are just pouring money into unrealistic dreams.

+++++++++

If you're new to mining then you should be using The Genesis Block calculator to help make your purchase decisions.  Less capable calculators can mislead you by not factoring difficulty increases, by far the most important data point in mining investments.

If you don't understand the fields then you need to understand them in detail before you make a move.  Feel free to ask questions.

It's here:

http://mining.thegenesisblock.com/

Put the numbers that apply to your purchase into ""Market &amp; Hardware Parameters.""  Some critical notes:

* Note that it is currently only autofilling 52% into Difficulty Increase Per Month.  This is unrealistic.  You should hand enter whatever percentage you see in Historical Difficulty Increases -- 30 Day (currently 98%) above.

* Set ""Initial Mining Date"" to when you realistically expect to plug the unit in.  Be **very** careful here.  Manufacturers are missing their ship dates left and right and even a single month can mean the difference between small gains and tremendous losses.

After you press calculate you will see how much money you will make (or lose) over the next year with the configuration you entered.

You can also choose some standard configurations from various hardware companies from the ""Select a Company: dropdown.

Please take that payout assessment seriously. At this point, for new entrants, in most cases it is a (substantially) money-losing proposition.  

Unrealistic optimism and gold fever are rampant in the mining world and decent people are losing quite a lot of money on their own inability to let go of what was once a cool thing, but is now a disaster for most miners looking to enter the game now.

This can be easily achievable if certain standards are created.

This would bring down the header cost of miners.  

The idea is to define a set of basic rules that ASIC companies should follow in order to bring down the cost of their manufacturing, and concentrate on chips only.  

For example, the company can design a standard motherboard with available sockets each socket on the motherboard have standard pin outs and the profile of the socket uses standard heat sink or waterblocks that can be mounted.  This would bring the cost down for everyone, and essentially allow the asic companies to design chips only.  Also it allows the users to just swap out the chips instead of upgrading the whole ASIC when it becomes obsolete.  

So when ASIC chips go obsolete, miners can just swap out the old chips and insert newer chips.

two weeks ago I introduced bitcoinOre.com to you guys, after a slow start, things starting looking really good after a week, and we had a good hash rate going.


On the evening of 8/05/2013 the site started experiencing trouble, after an investigation, it was determined that the site was under Dos attacks, and  attempts at exploiting the system.


Here is the hash-rate prior to the attack


http://imgur.com/UwIsoF5,gINk56X,TC2HvUi#1


Here is the hash rate during the attack


http://imgur.com/UwIsoF5,gINk56X,TC2HvUi#0


And here is the hash rate over view, before, during, and after the attack


http://imgur.com/UwIsoF5,gINk56X,TC2HvUi#2



While investigating the attacks, we also found people trying to take advantage of the reward system. Mining just enough to meet the 500, and logging in every 24hours or so, to mining for a minute and then disconnecting again. The idea behind the 48hours was to give the people who's miners might crash unexpectedly , an opportunity to still win the reward.

*Here are the new rules:*

Each IP Address is eligible for only one entry

To qualify for the reward (1 Bitcoin), you must have been actively mining at the site when the first block is discovered,

In the event your miner goes down,  we will look at your history and determine whether or not you were mining actively at the site, and just had the misfortune of having your miner crash for what ever reason.



I hope for those of you who have left us, might reconsider joining us again, and for those who have not yet given us a chance, to consider doing so.


Thanks.

I’m thinking of putting my computer to work when I’m at work. I have read that my Nvidia card isn’t the best, but it is what I have.


I do have a Raspberry Pi and  BeagleBone Black that can chip in as well that I can leave running 24/7.

I added a second 6870 today, no crossfire and when I started mining on just that card the primary displays became very laggy. Ideally, I'd love to isolate mining to the second card when doing heavy display work and not have it affect my primary card. 

To make the primary usable when mining on both cards I have the following config:

I'm getting around 450Kh/s with this setup and the primary display is decently usable. Using GPU-Z I am getting 93% load on each GPU which seems odd as the aggression is quite different. 

I'd love to sit the 2nd card (no monitors attached) to 100% load all the time and my primary card somewhere around 75%, whatever makes no major noticeable difference to my work. 

My GUIMiner setup had two miners, one for each card. Primary is similar to phoenix, 6270 concurrency, 128 worksize, instensity 12, vectors and 1 gpu thread. Same for 2nd card but with an intensity of 18. This basically froze my primary display. 

It seems quite obvious that I am not controlling each card as I should be. Any help in determining how to get close to what I want?

So I made the switch to Slush's pool and it's been about 24 hours so far. My first impressions are VERY positive. I was at BTC Guild bringing in about 0.35 BTC/day and so far after the move it's bumped up to about 0.38 BTC/day!

I'm working to make some scripts and convert all of my machines over to Linux which will make monitoring easier and the issue I laid out above a moot point.

I recently started using my desktop rig to mine during the nights or when I'm at work or class, figuring if it only ever makes a couple bitcoins, it will still just be extra money.  I end up averaging around 320 Mh/s from a Radeon 6950, one with no unlocked shaders or any modifications (for whatever reason, the shaders would not unlock despite multiple attempts).

Regardless of that, I've started noticing weird patterns over the last week or so.  Some night I'll leave Guiminer on over night and end up only getting somewhere around 130 accepted hashes and maybe a couple rejected ones.  Then, other nights, I'll leave guiminer up and end up waking up to 2000+ accepted hashes over the same amount of time.  That seems like an incredibly large discepency and I have no idea what is causing such a change.  It seems to happen randomly, and, if I have time to monitor the program, I can usually force it to quit and restart a couple of times and get a more productive night going.

My question is, what is causing this?  And what can I do to fix it?  I have no idea what other information to provide along-side this but I'd be really grateful for any advice or even just for someone to tell me what would be pertinent information.  Thanks so much for your time!

Because i really spend time to find the info, i will share it so the next guys who want to try/do it will know how to.


First make sure you installed nvidia and amd drivers. Then open your cmd.exe and go to the cgminer directory with the command ""cd path/to/cgminer""


Then launch cgminer with option -n or --ndevs like this ""cgminer -n""


Take the infos you need : the number after platform is the one you need.


make a .bat to launch cgminer and add ""-d X"" with X the number of your card you want to use.
-d option is to choose which GPU you want to use, if you want to add gpus, just add -d X for each card.

I know we're not at that point yet, but in any competitive equilibrium the expectation is that marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost.

And for an open access resource, network profits sum to zero.

Translation: when equilibrium is reached all network revenues are basically sunk back in to electricity costs: 25 * (exchange price) / (electricity price in $/kwh) * 6 (blocks/hr) / 1000 (kW/MW) will be the equilibrium power consumption.

Network power = 3p/(20e) is what that comes out to. let's plug in some values.

e ~ 0.15 $/kWh
p ~ $100/BTC today

**3x100/(20x.15) = 100 MW**

[Blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info/stats) estimates current power use around 46 MW as of today. What this means is that there is still profit to be had in turning on miners. However, I think it could also mean that people are anticipating ASICs and have turned off FPGA/GPU miners.

Adoption optimist:
p~$10,000/BTC
3*10,000/(20*.15) = 10,000 MW

1366172267.0,3,self.BitcoinMining,1cihal,Question regarding the increasing difficulty of mining with the influx of ASIC units,ihaveabu,3,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1cihal/question_regarding_the_increasing_difficulty_of/,"So I'm doing some math to figure out projected income from buying a ASIC unit (I'm looking at the Butterfly Lab models).

**According to this chart:** http://bitcoin.sipa.be/speed-lin-ever.png

difficulty has increased approximately 5e+6 in the past 6 months.

According to this wiki: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty
the **difficulty changes as every 2016 blocks** are mined.

The current network mining speed based on: http://bitcoincharts.com/
is 6.9 blocks/521 seconds or 1144 blocks/day at 61.989 TH/s or 61989 GH/s

From the same site, the next estimated difficulty will increase from 7.6e+6 to 8.8e+6 in 95 blocks, so for simplicity we'll say that at the current mining speed of 1144 blocks/day, difficulty will increase in 1e+6 every 2016 blocks, or 2 days. 

So at the current speed of 1144 blocks/day, **difficulty goes up 15e+6 every month**.

So by 5/17/2013, assuming global mining speed doesn't change, we'll be looking at a difficulty of over double the current difficulty.

With this said, Butterfly Labs is slated to release the first shipments of their ASIC units by the end of April. This means that the global mining speed should increase depending on the units available. Each unit would add from 5 to 50 GH/s to the current global speed of 61989 GH/s.

Assuming an arbiturary value of units in the initial shipment of 500 units, that's an extra 500 * 5 or 2500 GH/s added to the global processing speed. So in 1 month, global processing speed would increase by 4% conservatively.


Given all of this, using http://www.bitcoinx.com/profit/ to calculate profits, I yield this:

5GH/s (not including initial investment of equipment)

Current difficulty: 7e+6

Current USD/bitcoin ~ $68

Current monthly profit: $620

Current yearly profit: $6000

Factoring in the rising difficulty of 15e+6 per month (not at all taking into account the influx of ASIC units to the global mining speed):

In 6 months, difficulty goes from 7e+6 to 97e+06.

**This decreased the monthly profit from $620 to $35.**



Doing the same calculations using the faster models yield slightly more reasonable results, but each one ends with yearly projections that barely break even.




My question is this. Will bitcoin difficulty likely increase in the way I predict. If so, the earnings will decrease in a very fast rate, most likely before the ASIC units even get release.


And I just found this guy's set of calculations. Mine are very conservative in the difficulty increase, his might be more realistic:

I've been doing research on ASIC and how it is the way of the future of mining. What is puzzling me is how difficulty works.

How I understand it is that in the beginning people mined off there CPU, then learned how to use OpenCL and mine with there GPU. Now this raised the difficulty since people have a much higher Mhash now, by the end of the year or even potentially sooner ASIC will be the only way to mine efficiently and GPU's will be blown away.

Doesn't this mean that Miners are constantly having to purchase new ASIC hardware as the tech improves? to keep up with the difficulty.

Are people now buying dual 7970's, trying to break even with them and when ASIC becomes available they will hop on that train and try to break even with that?

How I understand it is that in order to stay competitive and ahead of the difficulty you will always have to replace your machine, will it get to the point where you break even and then you would have to replace your machine directly after that?



Aside from that, any tips on getting higher than 370? I've heard stories of people hitting 400 with a 7870. I am using GUIMiner if that is helpful.

I downloaded GUIMiner and fiddled around with it a bit, then I downloaded RPCMiner as well as Ufasoft. Ufasoft's CPU and GPU mining programs work fine but they don't do CUDA. Thus, I tried to get the CUDA RPCMiner to work but I ran into some problems:

1365711804.0,3,self.BitcoinMining,1c5p9j,"I have a few questions regarding bitcoin mining, GPUs, and ASICs. (Reposted from /r/Bitcoin)",RyanW1019,3,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1c5p9j/i_have_a_few_questions_regarding_bitcoin_mining/,"Okay, so like a lot of you probably did, I made it to [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining) page about mining. The basic message I took from it is that CPUs &lt;&lt; GPUs &lt;&lt;&lt; ASICs. CPUs have been rendered obsolete, GPUs are the current go-to mining hardware, and ASICs are going to dominate the future. However, it's not as simple as it seems. I know a friend who has two top-of-the-line, overclocked AMD graphics cards, running about $450 each. He's made about $300 so far, about $15 per day after the crash. So, he's still very far in the red, with about the best GPU setup you can get.


Supposedly, ASICs are orders of magnitude faster than GPUs and use less power; they're the long-term future of bitcoin mining. Google led me to Butterfly Lab's page, and the profitability calculations had me salivating. However, my research revealed that they've been delaying shipping for over half a year, and nobody has actually recieved one yet. If you ordered one now, you'd get it in several months (excluding the almost-certain delays to come). Avalon is another ASIC manufacturer, and they actually ship; however, the going rate for one of their ASICs is about 77 BTC, which is anywhere from $7000-$10000, and they're currently out of stock.

On top of this, once ASICs hit the market, the total hashrate will skyrocket, as well as the mining difficulty, and profit will decrease dramatically for everyone involved. I was hoping to buy either a high-end GPU or a low-end ASIC (not spending more than a few hundred dollars) and make a couple hundred dollars of profit after a few months. But now it seems that ASICs are a myth (or hideously expensive), GPUs are very expensive, and all miners are soon going to start seeing diminishing returns.


All things considered, it seems that the only way to make a profit mining is to already be mining now, because if you try to pick up some hardware and start now you're never going to make enough money to cover your initial expenses. Is that an accurate analysis or is there still hope for the future of mining? Unless somebody tells me I'm wrong, I'll either try actually buying some bitcoin and hoping for the market to recover or just follow Bitcoin's ups and downs as an outside observer.


TL;DR: Was really interested in making a small-scale profit off of mining, did a fair amount of research on it, now my view is ""why bother if you don't already have the hardware since you'll never break even.""

1364182216.0,4,self.BitcoinMining,1ayc9t,Buying hardware- NOT ASIC,titty_fartz,5,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/1ayc9t/buying_hardware_not_asic/,"A couple years ago I read up on mining and the general consensus on forums at the time boiled down to, ""It isn't worth it currently due to hardware about to come out.""  Now, two years later I'm revisiting the idea and the same general feeling is throughout the forums.

Based on this, I've decided to just go ahead and give it a try.  I'm set up and mining slowly on a single 7770 on my gaming rig.

Now, being the tech nerd that I am, I'm fully aware that I'm not going to get rich doing this, but I'm more interested just in the idea of utilizing hardware for something like mining and maximizing the outcome.

Next, I am in no way currently interested in ASIC due to the general difficulty in acquiring the hardware at this time.  I'm not against purchasing ASIC, but it needs to be more readily available.  I'm not the type of person to spend money in order to wait in line.

That brings me to my question.  Decent mining hardware short of ASIC.  Looking at FPGA, it seems the readily available items are from ZTEX.  What IS available on their site is the 1.15d at 215 MH/s for around $500.  That's a pretty crappy MH/s/$.

Other FPGA I've seen listed are from BFL which doesn't have much of a reputation around the boards.

So that brings it down to GPU mining.  I'm not having much luck finding affordable 5xxx cards and I'd like to maintain a resale value of some sorts so I'd like to look at current cards.  That leaves the 7xxx series.  Disregarding power, the best MH/s/$ value seems to be the 7850.  At roughly 300 MH/s and roughly $160.

(go ahead and correct me if I'm wrong so far)

Now, what I'd like to do is start building an array of 7850's.  This is where I am a litle lost.  From my reading I can probably get four 7850's running off of one MB using PCIE extenders.  Is this the maximum number of cards one can run on one MB?

What is a cost effective MB currently available to handle this?

Looking at the GA-990FXA-UD3 it has (4) PCIE 2.0 slots and (2) PCIE x1 slots.  Not sure if they could be all utilized or not.

I do have a MA770T-UD3P laying around that has (1) PCIEx16 slot and (4) PCIEx1 slots.  Could I get (4) 7850's running on that board?

Now that mining is profitable once again I decided to fix the rig and fire up my GPUs.

Now I have a few questions:

* Is it worth mining on p2pool? I know it's good for the bitcoin network and decentralization, but if I make like 10%-20% less profit than on a centralized pool I'm not sure I want that.
* I haven't used cgminer in the past. I really like it, but I'm not sure how to get the best performance out of my sapphire 6950s. Does anyone here have 6950s? What is the best cgminer config for these cards? They are watercooled, and I honestly don't care if they are still working in a few month, so I'm all for overclocking and almost-overheating them.
* What hashrate do you get from your 6950s?

EDIT: Forgot a question:

* Never heard of PPLNS before. What do you recommend, PPLNS or PPS? 

Any help is greatly appreciated!

PS: It feels so good to be back in the mining business. Once again I am generating money by heating my appartment. I'm really exited!

I increased the performance of the card in the Catalyst software so the gpu runs at 850mhz and I'm getting around 230 mhash/s on average. My settings are default settings. Can anyone shed some light as to whgat the different settings mean and suggest a good setting/flags for my card?

Also the GUI Miner says I have 1749 shares but slush website says I only have 4. It was around 200 but I just looked again and it says only 4. Why the huge difference? Is it ok to stop mining and start again or is it best to just leave it chugging away?

So I replaced the heat sink with a Zalman VF900-Cu, changed the thermal paste, loaded up phoenix, same problem. Fan spins fine, but the card overheats to 90 C with the fan at 100% and a 120mm blowing air on it in a 76 F room.

I work for an after school non-profit. I'm the network administrator/tech person/miracle worker/etc. I maintain the ""network"" and all of it's computers.

Since it's a non-profit and I'm still in school, I'm ridiculously underpaid, but it's a good company and they're flexible. However, I've had this recent idea to try making the industry minimum by using all of these ""computer lab"" PCs for bitcoin mining.

All of them (with the exception of two in the library) are about 5 to 10 years old. I have room for about 17 computers in this lab (possibly 20) and due to some law of the universe where elementary, middle school, and high school age kids somehow manage to break computers just by being near them, I have about 12 working. When I first got the job, most/all of them were full of malware and spyware, some running unlicensed copies of XP Pro so I have Ubuntu 10.04 on them. I'll be in the process of upgrading them over this week and next week.

The majority of the computers are these donated HP desktops that are dual-core P4s @ 2.5 GHz. The video cards are GeForce MX 440s (8x AGP). About four are Dell Optiplexes: single core P4s at 2.5 GHz with ATI Rage 128 Pros. The two library computers have integrated Intel GPUs and Pentium dual-core E200s.

Since I doubt I can do GPU mining, I was thinking about CPU mining. One core throughout the day from 11am - 8pm and from 8pm to 11am, these computers are working as hard as they can. I can write a few scripts and set up cron to do this for me. I was reading up on MMP (Multiminer Protocol) and have a computer in the ""office"" I can use as a server, then all the computers could run ufasoft and talk to the MMP server via JSON RPC unless there's a CPU miner that speaks MMP.

Has anyone done anything like this before? Does anyone have any advice? Is there a better way to do this? I spent most of yesterday reading up on bitcoin, bitcoin mining, etc. Still learning so if something I said doesn't add up, that's why.

P.S. Posting this year since I haven't gotten any attention from /r/Bitcoin.

As I don't have the capital, or confidence, to throw down a few thousand dollars on an ASIC miner I have been considering buying a part share in a machine.

Obviously there are multiple calculators for attempting to figure out profitability with mining hardware but what is best when attempting to figure out profitability of a part share in a hosted ASIC miner?

 - Does anyone have a calculator, or equation, that is made specifically for this?
 - Is the best method to determine profitability to simply calculate the hashing power from the part share, throw that in to a mining calculator, estimate the time of delivery, estimate what the difficulty will be at the time of delivery and minus the fee associated with hosting?
 - What is the best web based calculator to help with this?

What I am referring to as a 'part owner of an ASIC miner':

I would really like to know if one were to procure an ASIC device (eg: BFL, KnCMiner, etc) - would it be theoretically possible that one of these units could be re-purposed down the road?  Maybe after X months/year of mining, one could then unleash said unit on folding proteins, SETI, whatever.  

I know that this would make a lot of people rest more easily in buying one of these (especially those with SO that may share our interest in this emerging technology although not at today's upfront prices) - even if such a repurposing is still somewhat of a reach.

I'm a younger student, so earning $3900 takes around 3/4 of a year for me to do, so it is a bigger investment, for me personally. I've done some calculating though, and if the difficulty is 190 million, it would be paid off in around 90 days. Keep in mind that is 10x the current difficulty though, and IMO I think there's a slight chance of the difficulty going that high, but not a very good chance.

Also, another quick question I've been pondering, does difficulty scale in bitcoins? Say at current difficulty (19 million) there are 160TH/s mining (I think that's pretty accurate, give or take ~30TH/s), would the difficulty be 38 million when there are 320TH/s?

What I wasn't aware of was how valuable those friggin' coins would end up being. I've only been reading deeply about mining as a investment the last two weeks, so it's fair to say I've missed out on a lot of mining time with both BTC and LTC (too a certain degree).

If I could go back in time, to 2009. I'd sell my car, bike and invest every penny I could into mining BTC and never exchange a single coin. Come 2013 I would have cashed out big converting my BTC to GBP. 

I think a million bitcoins would have been enough. I'd live off the interest that I receive from having £80m (After capital  gains tax) in my British bank account (risky business, maybe I'd spread the risk a bit). I would never mine a single coin ever again. 

What I am interested in knowing is from any veterans or knowledgeable folk here is roughly how many bitcoins would it have been possible to mine if you started mining the day Bitcoin became public with a relatively large farm and spent not a single coin of what you earned. I'm aware mining capacity varies greatly and ""relatively large farm"" isn't the most precise but it doesn't have to be.

I've been looking at the 7870, the 5850 and the 6870.

From my rough number crunching:
PRICE - In dollars
Power - in Mh/s
Economy - In # of Mh/s received for purchase price
Efficiency - In Watts used per Mh/s

7870 - about $220 (~460Mh/s), (1.9 Mhs/$), (2.9mhs/W), 

6870 - about $150 ebay (~350mh/s), (2.8 Mhs/$) (2.2mhs/W)

5870 - about  $175 ebay (~300mh/s), (1.9 Mhs/$) (1.75mhs/W) 

7970 - about $400 (~650 mh/s), (1.6 Mhs/$) (3.1 Mhs/W) 


Running these numbers through https://bitclockers.com/calc I got the following:

Using their default difficulty setting, and estimating BTC to be worth $95 I got these results for break even time. 

Time to break even:

7870 - ~16 weeks

6870 - ~16 weeks

5850 - ~21 weeks

7970 - ~21 weeks

Please let me know if you figure this out! I'm using two 7950's and they were running flawlessly ALL DAY then out of nowhere started doing this crap! I'm using GUIminer and MSI Afterburner and had them initally clocked at 1200 core, but now I'm below stock clocks and still having this issue, the temp isn't going over 82 on one and not over 72 on the other, both crash at the same time though!

This SUCKS!
  
  
I was also reading that it may be an issue of having multiple ""poclbm.exe"" processes open? It seems I have to do that in order to run both cards...
  
I also wanted to add that my cards are running in crossfire (hooked up, enabled in CCC) but in GUIminer I have to start each seperately. Not sure if that could be causing the issue.

As a university student I'll also have access to my university's large stockpile of surplus desktop computers.

Hashrate-wise, nothing changed but I didn't expect it to. That's pretty much as fast as a 6870 will go. I think that, because I can push the clock all the way upto 1050 MHz without and noticable increase.
