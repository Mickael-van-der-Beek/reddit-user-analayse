So here I go.",jlmathis,146,30,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/1ekfp6/i_am_tired_of_all_the_people_not_willing_to_help/,"First off: New Turkers, welcome. It is extremely frustrating in the beginning knowing where to start out. First off, you need to keep your approval rating above 99%. This involves looking at a requesters T.O. which is Turk Opticon. It shows the approval rating of every requester out there. When first starting out, you shouldn't worry about the dollar per hour per say, but first getting to 1000 hits. Spend as much time as you can doing penny hits until you reach this goal. I will list requesters below at the end and tell you how to go about this. The second goal is to reach 5000 hits. Once you reach 5000 hits and a 99% approval rating everything pretty much opens up except Master qualifications. My first month was extremely frustrating. Turkers on mturkforum.com and turkernation are extremely unwilling to post requesters or batches that they do that make them extremely amounts of money for their time. I am not one of them. 

To begin: If you are using Firefox, search greasemonkey and install it. Then search mturk scripts for firefox and install them with greasemonkey.

2. If you are using Chrome, download Tampermonkey and install all the scripts including page monitor which automatically searches for your best requesters without doing anything.

When you first begin, do as many hits by requesters such as Redwood, Venue Quality, Earl, Joel Lehman, Task Rabbit, Skillpages and if need be Oscar Smith.

You can do surveys during this time as long as you have above a 95% or 99% approval. I also highly recommend you get the Adult content qualification. This will open up a lot.

Transcription wise Crowdsurf tends to be the best when you first get started. You can take the test and make really good money as long as you follow the directions.

Workers on forums are extremely vague about what they are working on due to the nature that if more people know about a good batch, then the less money they make. My theory is all is fair game.

* Bookmark the HIT search with your [preferred search conditions](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups&amp;searchWords=&amp;minReward=0.25&amp;qualifiedFor=on&amp;x=13&amp;y=7). (I use two conditions: [1] pay at least $0.25, and [2] already qualified). I put this link on my bookmark toolbar as a sort of nagging reminder, always in the foreground. Whatever the opposite of 'out of sight, out of mind' is, that's what this is for me.

* If you do put the HIT search link on your bookmark toolbar, this next tip is for you. Right click the bookmark and hit 'Properties' (if you're using Firefox). Type your mTurk worker ID in there. Now if a survey requires it, you can quickly access it -- just right click the bookmark on your toolbar, hit 'Properties' and copy the ID number whenever you need it. Chrome doesn't have bookmark Properties like Firefox, but you can just rename your bookmark to your mTurk worker ID instead. Right click the link on the toolbar and hit 'Edit'. Type your mTurk worker ID. Voila.

* Download [TurkOpticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) to quickly screen for shady requesters. It will place a button (an upside down triangle, blue if there are no reviews and red if there are reviews) next to each requester's name. Click it and the requester's rating/reviews will pop up. Comes in handy when a task seems too good to be true. (More often times than not, it is.) Make an account and post your own ratings/reviews if you want to to warn others about bad requesters or show support for good requesters. Or, y'know, don't.

* While you're at it, pick up [this](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/69128) Greasemonkey script. (If you're using Firefox and don't have Greasemonkey installed already, [download it here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/). It is awesome. If you're using Chrome, it's built into your browser so you're good to go.) This script lets you block/ignore requesters from your search results. It will place a little 'x' beside each requester's name. To block, just click the 'x'. This helps clean up your search results, and saves you time when you block scammers/requesters with poor ratings. Unfortunately, for reasons unbeknownst to me, this script doesn't work in Chrome. So it goes.

* Get yourself an AutoPager script/add-on. As you're nearing the end of your search results page, the script will load the next page for you right underneath. Less clicking, fuck yeah. (Efficiency, baby!) Here's one for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mmgagnmbebdebebbcleklifnobamjonh) and another for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autopager/). Disclaimer: I haven't used either of these. If you have a better suggestion, lemme know and I will edit it into this post.

* [This script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/111134) will add a 'Pending Earnings' item to your dashboard. Note that the only time the script runs is when you click on the Pending Earnings link. So do that every time you want an update.

* [This script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95331) will add a 'Today's Projected Earnings' item to your dashboard. It basically totals the earnings from all the HITs you've done for the day. Obviously it can't account for potential bonuses or rejections. But it's useful if you set a daily earnings goal for yourself. I aim to earn $1/day. [Thanks to [iamtehinternet](http://www.reddit.com/user/iamtehinternet) for mentioning this!]

* [This script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/126924) will display your account balance and worker ID in the header ([screenshot here](http://i.imgur.com/gHCGu.jpg)). Just a note: you don't have to double click the worker ID to select it -- just hover your cursor over it and hit Ctrl+C to copy. 
 
* Bookmark [/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor](/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor) and check it when you feel so inclined. If you don't like viewing by 'what's hot' you can bookmark [/r/HitsWorthTurkingFor/new](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/new) instead. Whatever works for you. 

* Try messing with the 'sort by' field in mTurk if you're having trouble finding good HITs. I tend to find some good ones when I sort by 'new'.

I really am beginning however to question the use of adfly for links on HWTF for the following reasons:

#1.  The profit is minimal. Even posting prolifically will only earn you a very small % of your total turking money each month. 

#2.  With HITS coming and going so fast lately that extra 5 seconds can really mean the difference between getting to the HIT on time or not.  

#3.  Adfly has had outages in the past few weeks, though brief they have caused delays in getting to the HITS, easy to just search for them but timing is key. 

#4.  Last week adfly downloaded a setup file to my computer twice.  I am assuming using a script on the intermediary page.  I immediately deleted the files but the potential for them to be malware is pretty distinct.  I understand given adflys business model they cannot really pick and chose, but a line has to be drawn. 

For those above reason I just directly link to the Mturk page, and really think others should consider doing the same.

1341545734.0,55,self.mturk,w41mu,"Here's a bunch of frequently asked questions. Pay attention, new Turkers!",Amandurp,65,10,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/w41mu/heres_a_bunch_of_frequently_asked_questions_pay/,"**I just started mTurk - Where's my money?!**

You may see the HITs you have completed shown as ""Approved - Pending Payment"" for days after you begin Turking. These funds will be released, *slowly*, on the *10th* day of completing *three or more* HITs.  These days do not have to be consecutive. 

**I did a HIT a week ago and it *still* hasn't approved. What gives?**

All HITs will auto approve within 30 days. This means they have up to 30 days to approve the HIT. 2-4 days seems to be the average time. CrowdFlower has their auto approval set to one day. Check out [this](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/130470) script to see a requester's auto approval time. 

**I did a hit fairly and I got rejected! What can I do?**

Usually, nothing. Sometimes requesters will make mistakes so it never hurts to message the requester and ask why you were rejected. However, mTurk has ""scam"" requesters - they will take your work and reject it unfairly. To weed out these scammers, download [Turk Opticon.](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/).

**Who is your TO, and what does he do?**

TO (Turk Opticon) is every Turkers secret death ray against scammy requesters. TO shows a little triangle next to a requesters name and shows the rating of the requester. If it's mostly green - you've got a fair requester. However, if you see red - proceed with caution.

**Will I have to submit tax information?**

You might. If you make over $600 in a calender year from the **same** requester, that requester should send you a tax form to fill. Which means, yes, you can make $600 or more per year on mTurk, as long as you never make more than $600 from a single requester.

**What are my options as an international (i.e. outside of the U.S.) user?**

Unfortunately, not much.  You can not use the Amazon gift codes on international Amazon websites. That's the extent of my knowledge on that though - hopefully a commenter will know more.

**How do I find good HITs?**

One word: /r/HITsWorthTurkingFor. If you find the subreddit useful, drop a buck or two into the community pool via Amazon Payments!

**What are qualifications, and why should I get them?**

You really only need one of them right off the bat - the Adult Content Qualification. If you plan on doing writing HITs, you may need a few more, but you can get em as you go along. 

**Can I do a HIT more than once?**

Unless it says that you can, don't. 

**How can I tell if i've already done a HIT?**

This is different for every Turker. Some do Excel spreadsheets, some rely on purple links and good ol' memory. Some requesters are now checking before you complete the HIT if you are eligible, which is great.

**Where can I find good scripts?**

[Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/sdyuo/turking_scripts_and_addons/)

These are all the FAQs that I can think of - anyone have any more that they see on here a lot?

From sodapress:

**What is my cap on the first ten days?**

You can have up to 100 accepts, *not* 100 submits. So you may have 70 submits and 30 returns and then you will be unable to do any HITS until 12 PST. 

Question from turkinforlife:

**What constitutes a good HIT? Who are good requesters to make money/build approved/rebuild %?**

A good HIT is one that pays at least 10c a minute. Other good HITs that may be low paying are easy ones such as playing games or ones with a possibility of a bonus. A good requester to start with is CrowdFlower. They often have no qualifications, are pretty easy, and once you get the hang of em you can crank them out quickly and they auto approve in one day. Crowdsource is pretty good as well. 
*Do not ever do a HIT that requires clicking on a ""short"" link (like adf.ly, adfoc.us, bit.ly, etc!) however, if you're on HWTF, we use short links as a monetary incentive.* Likewise, do not EVER submit personally identifying information (your city, state, birthdate, etc do not constitute personally identifying info. Telephone number, last name, address, etc do). 

**I live outside the US. I made an account with an american address, but they're asking for my SSN. Can I do HITs and cash out without it?**

Short answer: no.
Long answer: Because these payments go through Amazon Payments, a legit payment service just like Paypal, no payment will be distributed unless you have a proper account with your SSN, legal name, birthdate, etc on it. There is *no* way around this.

**Why do they ask for my SSN?**

They need this to verify your identity. Rest assured it is kept safe with Amazon, as mTurk has had hundreds of thousands of users with zero problems.

***TEMPLATE FOR EMAIL TO AMAZON***:

Hi
A whole bunch of my fellow turkers and I were massively rejected by requester 33cube. MASSIVE rejections for supposed ""poor quality"" work that all got rejected in a single minute. That seems virtually IMPOSSIBLE that someone can review 54 submissions or more within a single minute and reject them ALL at once. This is a scam, plain and simple.
He's now put up thousands more to scam us all out of even more money. Is there going to be something done about this? I don't care about losing the money, that comes with a rejection. I DO, HOWEVER, care about my numbers, which decide what jobs I will be able to do on this website. I use mturk to pay for medications, bills, and rent.
This would not be such an issue to me if it were only me. Sure, it'd be unfair to me but this is happening to many of your workers. So many of them.
What are you planning on doing about this? Can workers depend on you to have their backs? Or are we all on our own?
Please email me ASAP.

1349139330.0,35,self.mturk,10sirs,"Some humble suggestions for new-ish turkers. Most of this has been said before, but for real, you should listen.",js155306,44,9,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/10sirs/some_humble_suggestions_for_newish_turkers_most/,"Background: I started turking around the middle of July, and just recently I've enjoyed a major boost in my daily earnings. I started out with a goal of making $5 a day, which I was able to hit about 75% of the time by putting in about an hour's worth of work. But within the past two weeks, I've had seven days where I made upwards of $15 with just a little more effort. Here are some of the things that were instrumental for me:

* **Take advantage of the communities and tools at your disposal.** Aside from this subreddit and /r/hitsworthturkingfor, I'd suggest [Turker Nation](http://www.turkernation.com/), [Cloud Me Baby](www.cloudmebaby.com), and [TurkOpticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/). In addition to providing really good HITs, these places can answer most of your questions and give great feedback on specific requesters and strategies.

* **Get yourself over the 1000-hit threshold ASAP.** Seriously, I cannot stress this enough. If you have to, do 25-50 of [Oscar Smith's](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups&amp;searchWords=oscar+smith&amp;minReward=0.00&amp;x=0&amp;y=0) ridiculously low-paying jobs a day. It's basically a guaranteed approval, and it will eventually pay dividends. I dilly-dallied with surveys for a long time, and while they provided great pay rates, there's a whole new world that opens up once you've completed 1000 HITs. Just by browsing the ""HITs available to you"" category and sorting by ""HITs available (most first),"" ""HIT creation date (newest first)"" and ""Reward amount (most first)"" you can almost always find jobs that pay close to .10 per minute.

* **Don't be shy with repeatable HITs.** I know this one is going to be controversial for some of you. But if you're careful to check requesters' TO ratings, send messages to clarify requirements with ones that don't have any ratings and, **most importantly,** keep a list of recurring ones that pay well and don't reject your work, you'll grow to absolutely love them. Here are some of my favorites:

**Mark Olsen - Collect Nov 6th 2012 general election endorsement URLs for the listed political parties:** With the election rapidly approaching, I have doubts about whether this one will pop back up. But I did quite a few of them back on September 10, and was earning .10 per HIT, which took an average of about 45 seconds once I got the hang of them. I pestered Mark with questions early on, all of which were met with very prompt and detailed answers. I did over 100 of them with no rejections.

**Super Searches - Usability on Search Scoring:** These seem to pop up about once a month, and I think they're probably about due again. Basically, you're given four sets of search results for a particular keyword or term, then you rank them in terms of their usefulness and give a brief (1-2 sentence) explanation. Another .10 for 30 seconds of work. I do 50-100 of them each time they pop up, and have yet to receive a rejection.

**Amazon Requester Inc. - Rate Refinements????:** I don't remember the exact title of this one, but it's popped up a couple of times, with the last one coming around the beginning of August. You're given a link to a page on the Amazon web store and a description of a search refinement they had just added to a specific product category, and you're asked to rate the usefulness of the refinement. If memory serves, it pays .10 per HIT (each one taking about a minute) with a bonus for quality work that essentially doubles your pay rate. I remember being a bit skittish because of a questionable TO rating, but I did about 50 of them with no problems and received a full $5.00 bonus in the end.

**CrowdSource - Keyword Search on Google.com (US):** These are almost always available (they will temporarily block you after completing a certain amount, but check back in a day or two), and they pay .16 for just over a minute's worth of work. You can really expedite these HITs by utilizing a dual monitor setup.",,False,self,t5_2qmd7,False,,,True,t3_10sirs,http://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/10sirs/some_humble_suggestions_for_newish_turkers_most/,

I've recorded a short video of me completing a hit with the help of this script. I'll update this post when the script is ready. [Watch demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kV9R3gdR0A)

**UPDATE**: Sorry for the delay. Here's the **[script](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/173113)**. It requires the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en). Since it is required to run on all sites, I would recommend enabling it on demand. The script works with:

* CrowdSource
* Marketing
* myles anderson
* Walter Shimoon
* Amazon Woman
* Aaron Ormiston
* James Ormiston
* Edwin Massey
* etc.

Here's a [link](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/searchbar?selectedSearchType=hitgroups&amp;searchWords=ranking&amp;qualifiedFor=on) to all those hits.
It also takes into account the google domain requirement of the hits (google.co.uk, google.fr, etc).

The script works even you haven't accepted to work on the hits, so you can test it before starting to work.

**Note**: When you're on the google page, the script will highlight candidate results with red color. There could be several of them. So look at the two urls (result url, search url), and make sure they match. For example, if the search url is *http://oandsremodeling.com*, all following will be hightlighted:

* http://oandsremodeling.com/fire-water-damage/
* http://oandsremodeling.com &lt;- obviously, this is what we need in this case

Yesterday I received an email from techlist in my gmail inviting me to participate in a survey about words. I cannot remember the exact questions but it involved inputting words with personal relevance, and at the end it asked me to create a secure password. Before submitting the form I looked at my answers and thought, ""you know if someone wasn't careful they could easily enter information into this survey that could be used to phish their passwords."" This morning I got an email from Amazon, 'As a precaution, we've reset your Amazon.com password because you may have been subject to a ""phishing"" scam.' I checked out the only other active survey by techlist, which is asking questions about whether you use specific social media services. That is innocuous enough, but it seems like with a few different surveys could be used to build a pretty good phishing profile for a turker, then they would just need to get your email address. Maybe I need a tin foil hat, but I'm not doing techlist hits anymore.

**Update**: [mturk_techlist](http://www.reddit.com/user/mturk_techlist) has [put my mind](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/comments/wicvz/i_think_techlist_is_a_phishing_scam_xpost_from/c5duv9n) at ease regarding their HITs. I have no reason to suspect techlist is phishing, and I am grateful for their contributions to the mturk community. I regret using such alarmist language in my post title.

Then sends me another email saying that ""I just noticed a bunch of mistakes now on this survey, I am about to repost it with a different URL for the survey so anybody who I rejected can do this HIT again.""
Which is fine but I wanted my rejection revoked... he said he dind't know how, so I gave him instructions.

Then he sends this ""Now, though you may have actually taken my survey, I've been taken advantage of by many other workers and I also just received, instead of a confirmation code, the words ""f*** you"", so, unfortunately for you, I am no longer inclined to help you out with this and you can blame your peers. I just might consider revoking the rejection if you can honestly tell me that you are a Republican or Democrat and that you submitted a confirmation code, but otherwise I will not.""

So i answered him back... he finally says ""Fine I'll revoke the hit."" I say thank you, and then today I get this 

""Well, you can take that 'thank you' back...this is more trouble than it's worth to me, I need to get more information than I am willing to take the time to get. I've already spent more time on this than you did actually doing the HIT. If you want to let people know about the Worker who you can blame for me not wanting to be lenient with anybody, here's his/her ID: AQBP1QO28MWAU If he/she suffers some consequences for his/her behavior (to remind you he/she sent the words ""f*** you"" as a confirmation code), then I maaaaybe will consider revoking your rejection. But seriously, it doesn't matter, do more HITs and your record will be fine, and I really don't think I incorrectly rejected your HIT in the first place. You probably either indicated the wrong political affiliation, entered a code that was not valid, or did half the survey and then submitted the code. These are the only 3 reasons I rejected anybody. And no, the directions don't say that I won't pay Workers who only do half the survey, but that's only common sense. I obviously am not looking for a random sampling of confirmation codes. The response from MTurk support to my opening a ticket to resolve this issue was partially that I have the right to refuse payment to whoever I feel didn't earn it, end of story. ""

Its my first rejection... I don't really care about 1 rejection, or 30 cents, I only care because he even admitted that I didn't do anything wrong...   I don't know who that is he is referring to, but he was probably a jerk to them too. Anyways, I told him he must be a very unhappy angry person if he holds one person's rudeness up to everyone else for no reason.

This is my ""Amazon Payments Horror Story"".  I know that there are plenty of threads on this, but mine is a little different.  It ends.

I'd also like to preface this by saying that **I am a legal US citizen over 18 years of age with government issued ID, SSN, bank accounts, birth certificate, and credit history, all accessible to me.**  The hard part would be finding a fax. I did not create my account until I was 18.

---

I found out about mTurk via some /r/bestof post that linked to /r/beermoney.  It was a fantastic idea, but I was not yet 18, so I decided to read up on what this whole turking thing was.  I had loaded up the TO extension, registered accounts on the associated sites, and got a few choice scripts.  The 8 days I was able to turk I sumbitted 424, with 385 approved (1 reject, 58 pending) for a total of $48.03 and $5.80 pending.

Then I got the email.  A second request to verify information.  I thought nothing of it; I filled in the forms and happily went back to turking.  I could never had seen how wrong I was.

Almost immediately after, my account was locked down and I was prevented from turking.  Nothing to worry about, I thought.  I had read all these stories about people's accounts getting frozen and I knew what I had to do.  My first call with customer support, I was told it would be ""12-24 hours"" before their Account Specialist's would get back to me.  Almost immediately after hanging up, I received what looked like another automated message.  It said the same stuff (""...keeping with applicable banking laws, access to your account has been restricted."").  I thought it was just another email from the system, as the email I was getting would tell me what documents to fax over.

My second call was 5 days later.  The rep did the same thing, but this time sent me a personalized email (thanks Haley!) detailing that she had forwarded my issue to their Account Specialists.  Around one in the morning, the account specialists got back to me with another automated email, this time slightly different than the rest.

&gt;As a payment processor, Amazon Payments, Inc., is legally obligated to ""Know Our Customers.""  If we are not able to properly complete this process we are required to suspend account privileges until the matter is resolved. While we do not wish to cause our customers any unnecessary inconvenience, please understand this is simply an unavoidable requirement.

Seeing how many people resolved their issue by faxing identifying documents over, I suggested doing so.  This morning, I got this:

&gt;We looked into the status of your account and it appears that we were unable to verify the information used to register your Amazon Payments account, including the personal identifiers provided, such as Social Security Number.

&gt;As a result, your account has been blocked, and we regret that **we are not able to offer our services**. We would like to also add that *we do not support documentation or photographic identification in order to verify your identity.*

I'm taking that as their finishing move.  I am not able to have an Amazon Payments account due to whatever bullshit verification process my information goes through.  There goes more than $50 and almost 400 approved hits in an 8 day timespan.  There is nothing more I can do.  If you managed to get all the way down here, thanks.  Needed somewhere to vent.

**TL:DR; Amazon Payments took the banhammer to my account after they failed to verify my information.  Lost $50 and almost 400 accepted hits.**

Where we left off: Late January.  Amazon Payments Account Specialists have permanently frozen my Amazon Payments account.

Where we pick up: Early March (I wasn't actually fighting all this time, I pretty much gave up after that last post).

---

Paypal had similar issues verifying my information.  They, however, were quite nice when it came to this issue.  They requested some copied documents (more detailed than Payments had wanted) and sent me emails on a weekly basis saying that further restrictions had been placed on my account until I verified this information, easily faxed or uploaded to the site (they had only stopped my ability to put money into my Paypal account, funds in the account were free to transfer out).

Seeing the success I had with Paypal, I decided to send a follow up letter to Payments.  15 days later they got to it, and were not happy at all.

&gt;Further correspondence regarding the restrictions of your Amazon Payments account may not be answered.

The more I tried to talk to them, the harsher my punishment became.  This is the lowest part of the story, however, and it is all uphill from here.

I decided to start from scratch.  Tried the callback for Payments, no one was available to take my call (quite different, having your phone ring, say hello, and then hear a robot say nobody was home and hang up on you).  Called up Amazon Prime (of which my family has been a very active customer) and tried to get them to transfer or give me the number of the Accounts department. Jane @ Amazon Prime was very understanding, but could only forward me to Payments, where I talked to Rebecca.  Turns out they (or at least she) are based in North Dakota and were having some pretty horrible weather.  After hearing my claim, she opened a new ticket and forwarded it to the Account Specialists (she didn't have their number).

After some slight inspiration from that earlier post on the guy who got the Sim's refunded by EA after launching an ""Executive Email Carpet Bomb"" (and I was just tired of waiting), I forwarded the quoted above email to Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO.  This resulted in an ""Executive Customer Relations"" officer hearing my case (initial response time: 1 day).

Two days later, Payments was able to verify my information (the original info from mid January, I didn't even send them anything additional).

---

**tl;dr, Payments account verified after sending an email to the CEO and getting in touch with an Executive Customer Relations officer.**

---

I don't recommend, however, the entirety of the ""Executive Email Carpet Bomb"".  If you actually emailed all of the top level officers and anyone else you could find, and then your plan failed, you would have no where else to turn.

I am glad to be able to work on mturk once again and cannot fault the service for anything other than inactivity in my endeavor, and I don't even know if they *could* do anything.

EDIT: Executive Customer Relations followup:

&gt;I know this has been a frustrating experience, and I'm very sorry for the time its taken to resolve the issue.

So requesters who block you (like Income Inequality or Laura Alter) from future hits are still groovy and put out great hits which won't hurt your account in any way.  You just won't be able to do more from them.

Note though: this is only in concern to prevention purposes in a block, not for if you screw up so badly they block you for poor work.

It was my mistake to have rejected them in the first place. I didn't place the ethnicity qualifications in the qualifying criteria section in my HIT because I did not know that the skip logic I had added in my survey wasn't already reflected in the necessary HIT qualifications. I previously looked into options for adding the qualifying criteria appropriately while also reducing social desirability pressures to lie about one's ethnicity, but MTurk hasn't made the ethnicity qualifier an actual criteria option. Because I'm a PhD student with limited funds for surveys, would you consider 1 of the following options: 1.) I kindly ask (and prefer) you to email me with ""RR"" in the subject line. 2.)

I started turking a little over a year ago after WinSpinWin died (which was totally lame, but I still got around $60, woo gas money!).

Accordingly, we rejected your HIT because we have a requirement for a lifetime approval rating of 95% or better.

With this you can log your turking to get averages, graphs, and other statistics which aren't available on mTurk-- which should take less than 2 minutes a day to update.  If you don't care to keep a history on your HITS or to have your individual HIT values tracked, the second two tabs can be outright deleted and it would take &lt;1 minute a day to update.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy and if you have any questions feel free to ask.

Update 7/25: An email!

Hello Mother,
 
Thanks for your interest in joining the Amazon Mechanical Turk workforce.  I know you’re eager to get started working HITs and earning money. Unfortunately, I don’t have an estimate on how long the approval process will take. We'll notify you once your account has been fully activated and you’re able to work HITs.
 
In the meantime, you can browse the HITs available to see what you may have an interest in working.
 
Thanks for your continued patience while your account is being reviewed. 

--------

This email implies that registration is still open. It also implies the rep does not know much about the approval process because so many of you received the approval email within a day.

I am an occasional poster on this subreddit who is talking today because I found myself in a rather large financial bind. I got all my bills paid yesterday, and wound up with a whopping $17 in my bank account. Not good, I know. My rent is due at the end of this month, which means I will need to get myself $603 if I do not buy anything else for the rest of the month (and let's face it...I will).

The problem is, I do not have a job. I rely on freelancing in the film industry to make a living, but at the moment there is no work for poor dblandon. The sight of my bank statement today gave me a mini heart attack, so I decided it was time to get Turking. I decided I was going to take a new approach until the end of the month.

Mechanical Turk is my job. When I am on MTurk, I am at work. I will be at work eight hours a day, with a half hour lunch that does not count. I get two fifteen minute breaks during the day that do count for my time turking. Every hour on the hour, I get up and walk around the house/apartment complex a bit. Other than that, Turking. No Reddit, no Facebook, no forums, just Turking (or Textbroker if there is no Turking to be done. As long as there is money involved.)

I am tracking my earnings using a spreadsheet already, but came up with a new option for this. It's elegant and I love it. Frankly, it gives me a stats boner. 

Four columns: Date, Amount Earned, Hours Worked, and Hourly Pay. This is a great system for me, as I enter the hours worked at the beginning of the day, which means my hourly wage only goes up as I work more. 

When I finished the spreadsheet, I went to work. Just me and Mechanical Turk, no distractions, nothing but writing and rainymood. I did that for eight hours and it worked so well I added another hour to it. Call it overtime, whatever. At the end of the day, this was my dashboard:

http://imgur.com/PmaAM

I made $216 in nine hours today, which comes out to an even $24 an hour. I will not make this every day, but it beat my all time best day by $12, so I am okay with it. I am going to be Turking this way from now until I can find another stable income source. I don't get weekends off until I can pay rent, but then I get weekends off.

Does anyone else do something like this? I'm not saying you have to be quite as ridiculous and strict as I am, but does anyone else need Turking to eat or have a roof overhead? I would love to meet some people looking to get better at Turking and help them out/selfishly use them to help me improve my Turking as well.

HITs where you Google a few keywords and paste in the ""best"" URL on the first page? It's kind of shady in my opinion. I believe that a site called Reputation.com commissions these hits. When you Google their name and click through to a site, Google modifies their search results to be slightly more likely to return that result. Getting tens of thousands of turkers to do this can greatly change the results returned, and by only having turkers click ""positive"" links, negative search results can be hidden from casual viewer.

Sure enough, I got an email from payments-verification@amazon saying that they were unable to confirm my identity, because of failure to respond to past requests or because my given information couldn't be confirmed. 

The only ""past request"" I received was an email telling me to log on and go through the Verify Account Information stuff, which I did fully. 

I emailed them, and I received a reply stating nearly the exact same thing and an apology for the inconvenience. Nothing on how to rectify this. 

Has anyone else had the same experience and could put me on the right path? I replied to the last email, but I have no idea if it'll get read. I'm also considering calling them up. 

EDIT: Well, I just got another reply asking me to open a new account. Guess that's better than nothing. 

EDIT2: To my lack of surprise, that account was also restricted because the information couldn't be verified. I just sent the account specialist who's been working with me a rather long email:

&gt;Hello,
&gt;
I did as requested and opened a new Amazon Payments account with a new email address, this time under [email redacted]. I entered the exact same information: my address, phone number, birth date, and SSN. But that account is going under the same process as my first one.
&gt;
Just to clarify what happened:
&gt;
I created my account, entering the requested information. I verified my email address. I got another email instructing me to log on, go to Edit My Account Settings, then Verify My Account (or something similar). I entered address, phone number, birth date, and SSN again, then got an email saying my account has been restricted. 
&gt;
All of my information is completely accurate, and I can send any information to verify it. (Would adding my bank account be of any use?) 
&gt;
If there are any fixes to this problem, I would prefer it be done with first account ([email redacted]). 
&gt;
Thank you! 

I'm really hoping I get somewhere with this. 

EDIT3: Despiste our rapid back-and-forth correspondance yesterday morning, my Account Specialist hasn't emailed me back since my last message. I'm planning on waiting until Thursday and if there's no response, calling up customer service to see if anything can be done down that avenue. 

EDIT4: I called up customer service on Thursday and was told that an Account Specialist would be in contact with me. I got another ""We were unable to confirm your account information"" email, which I replied to asking if I could fax my ID. Next day, I got another ""We were unable to confirm your account information"" email. No joke. It's been ten days since I created my mTurk account and my Payments account was restricted, so I'm going to go with what capgras_delusion said and assume it's because of the holiday season. I think I'll try again after New Year's.

EDIT5: (for anyone still reading) I just sent Amazon Payments an email to customer service, detailing all that has happened. I received another automated reply, same old same old. Then I asked if there was any way to verify my information, and I was told that due to new business policies, there was no way to revoke the hold on my account and to make a new account.

I was pessimistic, but I did it anyway. Then it got restricted within minutes.

I sent a way longer, assertive email and got a reply... and it was from a human! She apologized and said she'd forward my problem to a specialist, blah blah blah. I have no idea where this will go, but reaching an actual human is a major accomplishment to me.

1. In a test that looked like this,

'Which result would you click

-""Listing 2"" (B)

-""Listing 3"" (C)

-""Listing 4"" (D)'

I'd really appreciate any help on these!

1. What is a HIT? I'm guessing it's like a job or work allocation, but I've seen people refer to them as sometimes being able to be done multiple times... how do HITs in general work?

2. Are there more turk sites out there other than Amazon? If so, how do you work out which are the best ones/where to find the best work/$ return?

3. How do you get relevant qualifications? The FAQ cited above says you need the Adult Content Qualification - any clues on that, what it is, how to get it, and whether it costs? Or is getting it just part of the application process included in the turk site?

4. For an international turker, does it work basically the same as American turkers, and can you still get your money out when you've earned it? I got quite confused by what the FAQ had to say about international turkers and it's left me worrying that if you're outside the U.S you're basically nitwibbled.

Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and suggestions about payment options for International Workers with us. Please feel free to continue to send us your comments and questions. We're constantly working on ways to improve our service, and your feedback is an important part of that process. 

People from all over the world are welcome to join and participate in Mechanical Turk. However for tax reasons, we currently don't have the ability to disburse cash payments. The funds received in your Mechanical Turk account can only be disbursed to your Amazon.com Gift Card balance.

We do hope to offer additional payment services to our international members in the future, and I'm sorry that we're not able to do so now. I'm also not able to predict when other options will become available. 

For a list of items available on Amazon.com to purchase and ship internationally, please visit http://www.amazonglobal.com

I regret I couldn't be more helpful.

Thank you for your patience and participation in Mechanical Turk.

&gt;""You have been banned for the following reason:
&gt;using known spammer IP!!!
&gt;Date the ban will be lifted: Never""

However, I very much doubt it was my proxy (which I ALWAYS use btw) since it has never been mentioned before and I did not spam anyone.  I also know for a fact that many people who post on mturk forum (an many other forums) use proxies.  It was in my opinion (which is the right opinion until I am proven differently) because I had made a post in response to sweetpea0678 who had quoted RWStein below.

&gt;Make sure you take the time to leave your TO review for Dustin here at X8 Data!!! 

&gt;He's left us a lot of work and as far as I can tell nothing has been rejected! 

&gt;Go to TurkOpticon and leave your review ASAP... The happier the company is the more work we get!

Sweetpea0678's response: 

&gt;How can we leave good TO when nothing has been approved yet. I am nervous as I have done a lot of his HITS and really enjoy them but nothing approved yet. I am holding off on leaving good TO until my work is accepted. Has anyone had work approved yet? 

&gt;I am very happy Dustin is here communicating with us....just would feel a lot better seeing my work approved since I have done a lot of his HITS now.


This ""ban"" showed up shortly after RW had come back online for the first time after my post.  I cannot tell you exactly what my post said because he of course, has deleted it.  Altough, other post before it and after it, are still there.  Go figure.  I guess I was only ""spamming"" some of the time. lulz.  But I would bet my paycheck that his ""stature"" being questioned and hurt was the reason for my banning.  I apologize that RWStein made himself look like a fool by posting something as asinine as telling people to make sure they post on TO for a reqeuster before the hits had approved/rejected but that is not my fault.  It shows his greeness as a turker and my banning because of it shows his inability to be a proper mod on your site.  It really is a shame that just when your site seems to be gaining ground that someone like an egotistical first time mod and new turker will hurt it in such a way.

I copy and pasted her reply that she e-mailed to me. Unfortunately, her TO has been nuked to oblivion because of her previous actions so she may want to consider making a new account to produce surveys with.

""Please know that I am very sorry for the trouble my HIT and rejection have caused you. I've decided to reverse the rejection. It was my mistake to have rejected them in the first place. I didn't place the ethnicity qualifications in the ""qualifying criteria"" section in my Mechanical Turk HIT in part because I did not know that the skip logic I had added in my survey wasn't already reflecting the necessary qualifications. That skip logic is what took you to the end of the survey after you answered the survey's first 2 questions. I looked into options for adding the qualifying criteria appropriately, but Amazon's Mechanical Turk hasn't made the ethnicity qualifier an actual criteria option. Instead, I've later learned to place it in the survey's actual description instead of a qualifier criteria.

I hadn't placed it in the job description previously because I was afraid of the social desirability pressures for people to lie that they met the ethnicity qualifications to participate. I thought that once they answered the ethnicity question (question 2 in my survey) that they would not be considered as  ""completed surveys"" and, therefore, their reputation would be in tact and they would not be confused about their pay. I honestly didn't think there would be any work for me to review at that point because I had ran pilot versions of the HIT in the previous days with 10-15 people at a time to make sure this was the case. I corresponded with several staff members with Mturk before and after the HITs. To avoid default acceptances and troubling rejections, I looked into other options. However, ""abandoning/returning"" the work could not be handled from my end. In the meantime, I've secured more funding and I am reversing the rejections.

I hope that you will forgive me and that you would consider working with me in the future. Please allow me 3-5 business days to reverse the rejection.

Thanks,
Vanessa""

TL;DR She screwed up and she is going to reverse all of our rejections and pay us the 85 cents (If I recall correctly) from the HIT.

 Last night I accepted a hit about Women's shopping, which stated (in broken English) to go to a webpage, choose your favorite bra, and paste the link back in the HIT page. OK, good, cool. The site had 30 pages of bra's, and I'm a girl so I took a minute looking at them. I didn't just want to pick the 1st one, even though I technically could have. I actually wanted to pick a favorite. Anyways, I pick one, copy the link &amp; go back to the HIT. Its expired. Crap. I go back &amp; find it again and look at the time allotted (should have done that before!). **60 seconds**. Thats how long they gave me to look at 30 pages worth of products. wtf. I contacted them about it, politely informed them that 60 seconds was not an adequate time for the HIT, and submitted the link I would have submitted in the HIT, had it not expired. Still waiting to hear back.

The second one was the 1st HIT I tried to complete today, a 5 minute CrowdFollower survey. Accepted HIT, clicked link to the survey, redirected to a Qualtrics ""the URL is incorrect, please try again"" page. wtf again. I reported the HIT as broken, and typed COULD NOT COMPLETE,SURVEY LINK INCORRECT in the box where you are supposed to put your survey code and submitted it. 

Edit: For the survey one, you had to accept the HIT before it gave you the link. I don't usually do ones like that, but it was 5 minutes and I must have felt lucky- I obviously wasn't.

For the bra one, yes MY FAULT for not carefully noting the time. I get it. I've never seen a HIT have a 60 second completion time, I glanced at it and must have assumed it said 60 minutes, like the great majority of the HITs I have done.

If it were done this way, workers would be able to use the search function for the number of minutes they want to spend.

I can understand how this can be frustrating - I used to have the same problem.

However, it's a problem that I feel is very simply solved. If you've done a lot of HITS it's a lot of work when it comes to setup, but once you've done that it only takes minutes.

[Here](http://imgur.com/wzN28) is a spreadsheet I created and I thought I'd share it with anyone who hadn't thought of it yet. As you can see I keep track of the date, requester and the HIT's name. At the bottom you can see that I'm using the search function. I **always** have this open when I'm doing HITS so that I can search keywords and it's saved me from many a rejection. Just be sure to include the HIT title if you make one, because otherwise it'll be confusing when you have your 50th HIT completed for Dolores Labs or some such thing.

It may not be the most revolutionary idea, but from many of the comments on HIT links I've been seeing it looks like other people could use it. As you can see I'm using Numbers, but the same concept works in Excel and other such office packages.

When I first looked at the account, I noticed that my ex-wife's name was on it, in addition to mine. I figured this was because years and years before, when we got married, we'd had a wedding registry on Amazon, and her name was on it. Probably just some old data that had somehow migrated over to Amazon Payments. No big whoop. I went into the account settings, thinking it would be a simple case of taking her name off the account. Nope! No such option. Okay, so I then send a polite message to Amazon customer service, explaining the situation, and requesting that her name be removed. 

The reply I received was...baffling. They said that because the account had been originally registered under both our names (it wasn't, I'd had my Amazon account for years before I met my wife), they a) could not change the name, and actually, b) prohibit the joint ownership of accounts and requested that I withdraw the remaining balance on my account after which the account will be permanently suspended, and bonus: I would have to open up a new account, using a different email address.

As I'm guessing you guys know, when you work on Amazon MTurk tasks, if you do it well (I do), you build up a good reputation, and an approval ratio, and you qualify for better and better jobs because of those factors. Add to that, if I was going to get a new account, why would I need to use a new email address? Here are my current stats, just so you'll know what I am losing by having to start over:

HITs Submitted--744	   
* Approved-------693 (99.1%)   
* Rejected----------6 (0.9%)   
* Pending----------45	   

I went around and around with them, via both email and telephone. Finally I spoke with a guy named Jeff G. on May 3rd, and he seemed to get it, that my ex had nothing to do with the account, that I had been jerked around, et cetera. He said he was going to elevate my issue to an account specialist. I thanked him, and breathed a sigh of relief.

Fast forward to a week later. I'd heard nothing from Amazon, good, bad, indifferent. I was finishing up a task (a rather involved one, worth a pretty good amount of money), and I got the completion code; I put the code into the HIT page, clicked submit...and got this message:

----

Your Amazon Payments account has been suspended

You will not be able to use Amazon Mechanical Turk until your Amazon Payments account is in good standing. Please contact customer service.

----

Aw, hell. It was 2am my time (I'm in Chicago), so there was nothing to be done about it until morning. I sent a new message to customer service, just concerning the account being suspended, not even mentioning my previous issue, because I felt like based on my prior interactions, it would only confuse the issue. 

I received a message back a few minutes ago, repeating the same story as before, they prohibit joint ownership of accounts, and that I should withdraw the remaining balance on your account after which the account will be permanently suspended. That last suggestion made me laugh, as due to the account being suspended, I couldn't withdraw any money even if I were so inclined. Add to that, I have 45 tasks still pending and unpaid, for which I estimate I am owed upwards of $15; I have around $75 in my account now. This is just depressing; I've heard of PayPal being this awful, but not Amazon.

So, tomorrow during business hours I'll try to talk to the same guy I spoke with before, who at least seemed to understand the facts of the case. If that doesn't help, I have no idea what I'm going to do. I sent a message to Consumerist, thinking this might be the kind of story they would be into, and on TurkerNation; but I'm open to advice. Thanks for reading.

----

**edit:** Before I had a chance to call today, I got an email saying that they didn't have my SSN or birthdate, two things they most certainly have had all along. I went to my account settings and double-checked, yep, they were there. Sent a reply saying that they should look at my account again. A few hours later, they emailed me to say that my account was un-suspended. I also got an email from someone at Amazon named Erin, who is a ""compliance analyst""; she wants to talk to me by phone on Monday.

Hi,

Firstly - I can't accept the HIT again:

"" There are no more available HITs in this group. See more HITs available to you below. ""

Secondly, do you realize how rejected HITs affect workers?

Our approval percentage is extremely valuable as having it decrease, even by 0.1 of a percentage point, seriously affects the HITs available to us.

When they are rejected for reasons outside our control, it is absolutely infuriating.

Can I suggest you find a way of resolving this situation?

Thanks.

Here is the email reply I got back today from Amazon:

As a result of this change, Amazon Payments, as the third party payment network provider for Mechanical Turk transactions, is responsible for reporting transactions that meet the IRS thresholds via Form 1099-K, this reporting includes Worker earnings.  As a result of this change, Mechanical Turk will no longer provide the Mechanical Turk tax report to Requesters.    
No action is required on your part.

&gt;The Form 1099-K reporting instructions (http://www.irs.gov/uac/Form-1099-K%2C-Merchant-Card-and-Third-Party-Network-Payments) and the IRS website (http://www.irs.gov) provide more information about these regulations.

We appreciate your use of Amazon Payments.  Unfortunately, we have been unable to confirm your account information.  This may be because you failed to respond to our past requests for more information or we could not confirm the additional information you gave us.

&gt;In either case, we are now required to restrict your Amazon Payments account features.

Which sucks but I was still able to compete HITs and withdraw from my account so I thought it would clear up when my info went through. I get another ""We appreciate.."" message to which I assume will clear up.

Then this.

At registration we collect customer information such as name, address, date of birth and social security number. We use this information to verify the account holder’s identity.

* I'm in the UK, so the number of HIT's isn't great, although still get the odd one or two on r/hitsworthturkingfor
* Most of the money I've earned was from NetMSi - they were fun, although seem to have dried up
* I have submitted 1323, with 11 rejections
* My rejections were: 5 from our friend Sebastian Darr (as far as I'm concerned, the email addresses were correct, they just weren't the person's name), 5 for a colour extraction (I didn't read the instructions properly and included the finish information, so can't complain) and one for an object outline, I didn't outline close enough
* Initially, just get HITs done to get you number approved up and over 1000 - I haven't seen too many that need more than 1000 approvals (although I did see one needing 15000)
* I have a couple of search terms for HITs that I've found to be worthwhile:
* 'sentiment' : Crowd Flower wanting to know the sentiment of YouTube comments, 4c for reading five comments, usually come in batches at 0900 GMT
* 'advice to improve' : Feedback on websites, kinda interesting, 70c
* 'NetMSi' : Titles and descriptions for porn clips 8 or 12c
* 'write a unique' : Usually wanting a 150 word 'article' about some topic, generally pretty easy 50c (from memory)
* My original plan was to do this for some extra cash, although I can't get at the cash, I have to buy something from Amazon US and get it shipped over
* Most of the HITs aren't worth the time - I tend to do them whilst having lunch at work, or if I'm bored at home. Occasionally there will be some worth working through, however when you factor in the time spent finding them, the hourly rate drops down below, $5 per hour.
* Every now and then, have a look through the 'all HITs' list to see if there are any that require a qualification that you can get
* The worker site on Amazon needs improving, hiding requesters and specific HITs would be good, also HITs that I can't get a qualification for (ie those requesting a specific country) and HIT language


I was uploading a screenshot of my balance, however imgur seems to be having issues.

Edit:
* I'm not sure how many hours I've spent looking for and working on HITs, about 25 - 30 at a guess.

Then there was someone with a HIT up asking what category a document would belong to (News/Health/Parenting etc) at 0,10 a piece $_$ Took about 10-20 seconds per HIT... I did about 300 of those.

Yesterday's rejected hit was for some experiment where 8 people had to be online, logged into a pre-made Gmail account, then the experiment would start.

I've been at Mturk for 9 days now, and i just hit $49.00 with about 20 pending. the first day i did this I had zero clue what i was doing, took me a few hours and some reading now i have it nailed down.

It all boils down to personal preference, I find that searching for hits that are $.20 is far more profitable than searching for hits that are more money. (basically searchine for $.2 hits also includes .30, .35 and everything in between)

I started with Surveys and i became bored with them instantly, i still do them randomly, I found that the return on investment isn't nearly as good as the hits where you have to write reviews paragraphs, essays etc... again, its all personal preference, I find that I can blast though a 150 - 300 world essay in minutes, (i can do 5 to 7 in 30 minutes), with zero rejects so far, EDIT: i just had a few rejected tonight, not a big deal so far though

**The search function is your friend...** if you are running out of good hits, search for ""newest"", ""oldest"", ""most hits"", i find doing that brings up all kinds of options.

when you type in your dollar amount, you can also type in the kind of hit you want, for example: type in the ""containing"" field **""Survey""**, then type in **$.2** (or the dollar amount of your choosing)... doing this will net you all the **""surveys** starting form **$.2** and up. 

I find i can make double the cash without searching though blogs telling me hits are good, for me its about trial and error (also i don't need the cash immediately, so i dont mind waiting to get paid out). basically. the more time i spend not searching Mturk, the less I'm making.

that's what i do, and i hope it helps you guys out.",,False,self,t5_2qmd7,True,,,True,t3_owf2m,http://www.reddit.com/r/mturk/comments/owf2m/my_suggestions/,

I created my mturk and Amazon Payments account about a week ago and was approved. I never got around to completely verifying my Amazon Payments account (I know, my bad) because I was too excited to start turking. A week later, I have about $65 approved and several pending.

I verify my Payments account today and I run into the same issue many have run into- they can't verify my info so they have to suspend it. I call customer service and they tell me they'll elevate it to a specialist. I log into my mturk account this evening and see that I've been blocked as well. The error message is ""You will not be able to use Amazon Mechanical Turk until your Amazon Payments account is in good standing.""

What would be the best route now? Has anyone been able to change their payment account on an existing mturk account? (since it seems like I have to create a new account anyways.) I emailed Amazon back saying that I can't understand why I have to create a new account when I can just re-verify, especially since I have money that hasn't been sent to me yet. I'm also going to send mturk an email since it's past phone hours. I know, I'm annoying and persistent, but I was counting on mturk for some extra expenses.

The job is to copy and paste debates from the old version of my site to the new one. The information is stored in fields and needs to be pasted into the corresponding field on the new site (eg old site http://debatewise.org/debates/11 - to new site - http://debatewise.net/add-debate).

I was able to do ten debates in 30 minutes. These varied in length and I think an average of 3 minutes per debate is about right. Some may take up to six minutes, but they're aren't many of them and most can probably be done in about two minutes or less. 

How much do you think I should pay per HIT? Can I make a HIT ten debates or does it need to be one? And is there anything else you'd advise me to put in the text or set in the settings in order to attract good quality people?
 
Lastly, if you've got any tips on making my form easier to use for Turkers, or reducing the opportunity for errors I'd be grateful for them.

Here are all the details:

We have a ton of audio tracks that need metadata. These are the specific fields that we need populated:

	•	Description
	•	Keywords
	•	Moods
	•	Featured Instrument (Which will most likely just be ""Synth"")
	•	Is track instrumental (Yes/No)
	•	Vocals (Male/Female or N/A)

We only need these fields populated. We pay $0.50  per track, just a heads up though, we do go through all the metadata you submit and if it does not meet out standards then we will ask you to revise the metadata until it is up to par. We pay out at the end of every month.

Most modern theories of decision making recognize the fact that decisions do not take place in a vacuum. Individual preferences and knowledge, along with situational variables can greatly impact the decision process. In order to facilitate our research on decision making we are interested in knowing certain factors about you, the decision maker. Specifically, we are interested in whether you actually take the time to read the directions; if not, then some of our manipulations that rely on changes in the instructions will be ineffective.

Found on another forum and have been using for a week. This is an awesome and simple way to track hits...

For surveys, I clip the page to Evernote. For any HIT I ever want to remember, actually. If I see a survey I think I might have done, I just google any keyword from the HIT, such as the requester's name, and it retrieves any HIT I've ever done for them from Evernote. Evernote rocks because it is completely text searchable, and has an extension for google.

I also clip each page of my status once they've all cleared into Evernote. When I search a requester in google, I get all the status pages with their name on it, and all the wonderful information that goes with it. 

I also forward every email I've ever received that has anything to do with mTurk to Evernote. If I google, for example, Dec 24, it retrieves all my status pages for that date. If I google Nelson Lau, I get every status page, HIT and email with his name on it. 

I would like share one last awesome use for Evernote, as an example. Company Matches. As I went through their qualification I requested feedback on every batch. I sent these feedback emails to Evernote. I sent their instructions from the HITs and from the link in a thread on TurkerNation to Evernote. I clipped each page from the message threads on this forum where they have responded to questions. The end result? When I have a company on one of their HITs that I am unsure of, I google the name and the top of the search results are from my Evernote account. So I see instantly if they have ever used the word ""Seiko"" in any of their feedback.

Makes it easy to store and retrieve style guides too.

Is it -- funds start posting 10 days *after* signing up, or -- funds approved *after* having taken HITs for any 10 days.  Example:  Work 2 days, day off, work 3 days, day off, work 5 days = 10 days actually worked and funds start posting.  Or, signed up, worked some, 10 days later funds start posting. Or even, do the worked days have to be consecutive?

Sorry if it's been asked before, but I did try to search through the posts on here and couldn't find a concrete answer to this.

tl;dr:  Funds post after 10 *consecutive* days of actively taking HITs or 10 days from first day of signing up regardless of how or when HITs were taken?  Thanks so very much for any answers. I do appreciate it.

**ADDENDUM**:  Okay. I'll try this again. I *thought* I added the email Amazon sent me explaining their 10-day policy.  Here it is again:

Hello A      ,

I'm sorry for any concern regarding your Mechanical Turk earnings.

As a part of our continuous efforts to ensure that Mechanical Turk remains beneficial to both Requesters and Workers, a mandatory hold on earnings transfers is applied to new Worker accounts. This hold will be removed after you have submitted at least 3 HITs a day for 10 ""active"" days. Looking at your account, I see you have had 5 active days.

Until the 10 active day requirement has been met, all approved HITs will be listed as Approved - Pending Payment for 10 days when you view the details of your activity by date on the dashboard. During your holding period, your earnings will be transferred to your account 10 days after the HIT was approved by the requester. For example, if your first HIT was approved by the requester on the 1st of the month, you will be paid on the 11th of that same month.

It may take between 24 - 48 hours for the transfer to be completed. When the transfer is complete, the HIT status will change to Paid and your account balance will reflect these payments.
   
Once your account balance reflects payment of your earnings you will be able to transfer your earnings to your Amazon.com gift card balance or a verified bank account.

Again, I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused and I hope this helps. Thank you for participating in Mechanical Turk.

HWTF:
So far I love this community. I think the idea of organic growth is a great thing. I only try to post quality (i think) links. Most of the surveys I post tend to be somewhat intriguing to myself and I hope others. I dont like the idea of posting specifics of AC's, I usually tend to use a more ambiguous scale of easy-hard. I do a basic search of the HiT before I post, and will not repost anything I feel would be stepping on someones dick. If its over a week or 2 old, didnt get any attention on what I think is a quiality HiT, or was poorly represented I might see a need to repost it. But generally, Ill try to avoid reposts. I genuinely try to be a positive and proactive member and I think many other newbies feel the same. As far as Im concerned, in this case, the more the merrier. The good posts will rise and the bad will fall, its why this style of community is great. Its self pruning.

Turking in general:
I always try to pay attention as best I can and fill out everything honestly. I think its important that everyone do the same for the integrity of the system. I have had HiTs that I genuinely enjoy and plenty of bad ones too. I enjoy learning about the human mind on a laymen level, so there are some psych surveys I really enjoyed. So far Ive put in about 20 hours total and have made about $30 with another 40 or so pending. So thats not a horrible pay rate but do not expect get rich or anything.

I expect to use this to supplement my regimen of Ebay (I sell mostly video game related stuff /shameless plug), craigslist and gold prospecting to lead the lifestyle I have grown accustomed to. Which is beer in the fridge, green in the pipe and most importantly, my girl by my side.

Just wanted to share a few thoughts so far, feel free to let me know what you think.

All my stuff going back to day one is Approved-Pending payment. Is this just waiting for the 10th day, or is this something different? What is the average time between approved-pending payment and approved-paid? 

I have stuff from day 1 that is still pending approval. How long is something listed as pending approval before it defaults to something. Is it common to go 9+ days in the pending approval state for a hit? 

I am recently unemployed and am turking an hour or two a day while I look for another job just to have some income rather than none. In 9 days I have about $30 approved-pending payment, and about another $40 in pending approval. I am doing good? Any tips to maximize $/hr? 

Without wasting gas driving to work, or time wasted driving to work and home, and considering I can do an hour here an hour there with no schedule I have to follow, turking is actually an ideal source of income for a broke college student. I would still rather have a real job that pays a little more, but in the mean time I find turking is actually alot better than I first thought when I started.

What happens if I buy a gift card and where does the money go? Can I buy a gift card for any amount and use it whenever I want? Can I use Amazon payments on other sites?

Will my balance ever expire?

I made a third account hoping that the third time would be the charm, but here I am with another Amazon Payments account being suspended.  No matter what I send to their customer service, I always get the same automated message.

Is any one else having this problem? Is there a reason I'm having this problem? If you have faced this problem before and got it resolved, how did you do it?

I've been registered with mturk for years. I am Australian, I registered in Australia, and earned about $400 while I was there. Last year, I moved to the USA. I applied for, and received, my EAD which gives me the legal right to work in the USA. I also applied for, and received, my social security number. 

However, all that applying took a long time, so it's been a while since I have been on mturk, since I couldn't do any HITs until I gave them US tax information. Today, I entered my SSN and it said they would verify it with the IRS, but I could accept HITs in the meantime. Except, it turns out, I can't. When I try, I get this error:

**We have detected that your Amazon Payments account cannot be used with Amazon Mechanical Turk

Please update your address on Amazon.com to reflect where you live. Otherwise, please contact customer support for assistance.**

Does anyone know wtf this means? I have emailed them about it, and also about transferring funds to a US bank account (I don't see any option for me to do that).

This is where it gets a little complicated. I couldn't actually find a straightforward way to change my mturk account over from being Australian to American. I emailed them about it, they replied with some form bullshit that didn't answer my question. I ended up calling a number I found (which turned out to be AWS), and the guy told me to go into my Amazon account, into my address book, and delete any Australian addresses. After I did that, though, he told me that it wouldn't work, it couldn't be done and he was sorry. Except, it did work - kind of. Mturk then asked me for my tax information (they already had my tax information from Australia, but now they were asking for US tax info), and sent me daily emails for a week or so, asking me to update the details (which I couldn't until now, because I didn't yet have my SSN). 

Has this kind of thing happened to anyone else? I have an extremely high approval rating on mturk, I have done thousands of HITs, and I have Master Qualifications with some requesters.

I did a little search to see if I could find this, and I am sure it may have been asked already and if it has, I apologize.

I have earned 10 dollars in roughly 5 days since I started, but I am still not entirely sure if mturk is worth the time and effort.  After all, opportunity cost has to be taken into consideration.

I am wondering what the daily averages are for those who have been doing this awhile and how much time they spend a day on mturk on average. And if anyone knows, what they average a month.

I seen a few HITs that demands like 10 minutes for only pennies, which I find quite ridiculous; however, I have found HITsWorthTurkingFor to be quite valuable.  Obviously, out of the ""make money online"" choices out there, mturk is easily the quickest. I have yet to decide what I am going to do yet.

I'd like to search for ""Endor OR Redwood OR Gandalf"". It appears Mturk does not support this, as it looks for ALL search terms in a HIT. Is there a script which will allow me to OR search terms together to show HITs that have at least one word in them? I'd also like to search just the requester name. 

Thanks.
