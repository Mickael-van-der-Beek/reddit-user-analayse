Shuddup, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.


A SMART person would obviously know that Bruce Wayne is a seductress and he seduced the Batman one night after Batman saved Bruce's life. Now, after they had their fling, Bruce probably didn't call Batman (he's famous for that, so Batman was delusional if he thought Bruce would try to contact him). So the OBVIOUS reason is that Bruce and Batman had a one-night stand and can't bear to be in the same room anymore. It makes perfect sense.


This leads me to think that maybe Bruce is paying off the writers at DC to make them seem to be the same person. Maybe Bruce feels that Batman is his soulmate but is too afraid to admit it so he just hides in his piles of money. Another thing...

The only logical conclusion is that he wasn't made in the same factory that the other droids came from. But if that's the case, where *did* he come from?

The answer is obvious. Darth Vader himself built him.

See, Darth Vader wasn't always a Sith lord. He was probably a little kid at some point. And when he was growing up, he was, like, dirt poor. And what does every poor kid want? That's right, **a robot**. But he was poor, *so he would have to make it himself*. Naturally, a poor family would want a droid that could help out around the house, or help them with whatever menial labor they had to perform, so building a protocol droid with arms and legs that barely bend was the obvious choice. Of course, he was just a kid at the time (or a really emo teenager, at the very most), so he didn't get everything right, and that's why C3P0 looks like every other protocol droid in existence, but is a different color. When George Lucas releases the Star Wars prequels, I'm sure this theory will be one of the first to be confirmed. It simply makes too much sense to not be addressed. 

I've also been developing a theory based on the evidence that suggests that ""The Force"" is actually caused by a type of microorganism that only lives in Jedi blood, and that that's where Jedis get their magic from. I need to do a bit more research into that, though.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_1hncoq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/1hncoq/darth_vader_built_c3p0/,

But in The Little Mermaid, Ursula is actually Ariel's mother (same goes for her sisters), whose ""curse"" is in fact a parting gift to get at least one of her daughters out of the grasp of King Triton, who is a violent, abusive father. 

Ursula is described as evil by King Triton to his daughters, but why? Unlike everyone else, she is half octopus- one of the most intelligent creatures under the sea. She's also the only character who poses an actual threat against King Triton's power, having harnessed magical powers of greater strength and versatility than Triton's...Triton. And, big surprise, after birthing like 12 kids, she doesn't have the lithe body of a normal mermaid.

We've seen that King Triton has severe anger issues, demanding absolute obedience from his children, even frightening all of the other sea creatures when he grows angry. Sebastian does his best to protect Ariel, begging her to obey, because he has seen the extent of Triton's rage. 

So King Triton's fear is that his daughters will be intelligent, strong and independent. So he makes them fear their mother, who is all of these things. He makes them focus on their appearance and singing, because being pleasing to a man is the only thing he wants them to strive for. But Ariel is, as she sings ""Sick of swimming, ready to stand""

The desire to explore land begins when she falls in love with prince Eric. It's an initial step away from the clutches of her controlling father  that is motivated by her attraction to a man. But Ursula knows that even if misguided, she should encourage this in her youngest daughter because Ariel's the only one that shows any independent thought from the dad. It's just too late for the other daughters.

So, in hopes of showing Ariel that Prince Eric is just another douchebag, she enables her daughter to have legs, but no voice. Ursula was hoping that Ariel would realize how shallow Eric is when he falls in love over her appearance and vulnerability, and that it doesn't really matter to him whether she has a voice of her own or not.

This plan fails because Ariel has such a fish boner for Eric, that she doesn't realize how shallow he is. So Ursula goes to the extreme, transforming herself into black-haired Ariel, who prince Eric falls in love with just as quickly. It was a last-ditch effort to get Ariel to see Eric for what he really is, and it fails miserably. 

So in hopes of trading in her controlling, abusive father for a shallow, douche husband, Ariel ends up killing her own mother, who only wanted to give her a chance to live free, instead of being either literally or figuratively submerged by patriarchal misogyny.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_uwcg0,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/uwcg0/disneys_the_little_mermaid_a_feminist_tragedy/,

He used a Chameleon Arch to turn himself in a sponge to hide. Allow me to elaborate.

In ""Human Nature"" (Doctor Who, s3e8) it is revealed that Time Lords have the technology to change into other species and store their Time Lordyness in a clock, a side effect of which being that someone holding it sometimes hears voices coming from it. The Doctor uses it to to disguise himself as a human. Time Lords happen to look a lot like humans, so his physical appearance doesn't change. But the device is capable of making physical changes to his body, as evident by his one heart. So it's only logical that the Chameleon Arch would be just as capable of turning a Time Lord into a sea sponge.

This explains why Spongebob's clock talks to him in ""Procrastination"" (SpongeBob, s2e17). It's what's storing his Time Lord essence or whatever. The clock has a perception field on it, which is why he usually doesn't pay attention to it. But when he was stressed out about his essay, he had no choice but to check the time. When he pays attention to the clock, he hears it saying ""Time's up, SpongeBob."" He assumes it's talking about his essay, but in reality that's one of his memories from when he was a Time Lord.

But wait, you ask, how do we *know* he's a Time Lord and not just an ordinary sea sponge who happens to be prone to vivid hallucinations? Well, my friend, don't leave me now. I have more evidence to show.

For example if we look closely, we'll see how little we really know about SpongeBob's past. Sure, there are plenty of flashbacks and retelling, but there are far too many contradictions for us to be able to take any of it as fact. For example, ""Your Shoe's Untied"" (SpongeBob, s2e1), SpongeBob has a flashback to his youth. He is depicted as a realistic sponge spore thing with shoes, implying that he was made with normal sponge reproduction. But in ""Truth Or Square"" (s6e23) he has a flashback as himself as a fetus sucking krappy patty's out of the umbilical cord (I'm not making this up, by the way.) which implies that he developed in his mother's womb like some kind of mammal. Why his he unable to keep his memories consistent? For the same reason why John Smith couldn't recall instances from his childhood: None of it actually happens. They were just fake memories created when he was transformed.

And last but not least, there's the most conclusive evidence:  SpongeBob's pineapple. It's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. Presumably, this was his TARDIS. It's just in disguise and stuff.  I can't think of any other plausible explanation for why it looks like his bedroom alone couldn't fit inside that little pineapple, and yet he somehow fits a whole two-story home in there with a kitchen, living room, bedroom and more inside. It's clearly not the same model that the Doctor uses, as the inside looks different, but it's definitely a TARDIS. SpongeBob, of course, doesn't know this. He just thinks it's an ordinary pineapple.

VIDEO TRANSCRIPT:

On its surface, “Finding Nemo” is the touching story of a clownfish named Marlin who searches the vast ocean in hopes of finding his lost son Nemo. Along the way, Marlin meets a number of interesting other fish and animals, and gets himself in a variety of interesting situations. By the end of the film, Marlin learns a little about the great many mysteries of the ocean, and a bit about life itself as well. Delve deeper into the story however, and you will find that loss, and the acceptance of loss, plays an important part in the film. Marlin, due to his nature and also to events surrounding him, cannot let go. His inability to let go and trust others not only limits himself and his friends, but in also puts him and his friends in danger.

It is no stretch of the imagination to interpret “Finding Nemo” as a story based on coping with loss. The themes of loss are evident in the work as a whole, including loss which cannot be changed, such as the deaths of his wife and children. By learning to “let go”, Marlin has a chance going on with his life, not simply being hindered by his past. At a key point in the film, Marlin is instructed by his friend to “let go”. The explicit meaning of the line, to let go of a whale’s tongue, hides with it the true meaning of the film – letting go of the past.

Given all this, it is not unreasonable to see Nemo not as his son, but as a personification for the losses he has endured yet still cannot let go of. Nemo, in this case, is simply a metaphor. The word Nemo itself, when translated from Latin, means “nobody” or “no one”. This, in a sense, effectively makes the title of the film “Finding No One”. 

Consider Nemo’s abduction towards the beginning of the film. It occurs on what would be Nemo’s first day of school – a day which many parents must learn to let go, not be overly protective. Nemo’s loss is not a punishment for Marlin learning to let go, but his inability to. The image of Nemo being pulled out of the water upwards into the open air evokes imagery of souls being pulled to heaven. The choice of a white boat, as opposed to any other color boat, may draw parallels to the white whale Moby Dick, which represented God, nature, and the great unknown.

The ocean proves to be a vast area to search. True, Marlin has a difficult time finding anything in the ocean. The only other character that is there to help him throughout his quest in a Regal tang named Dory, who, because of her short term memory loss, essentially suffers loss every day. Despite this, Dory’s character, she proves to be happier and more well-adjusted to coping to life’s problems than Marlin.

It is with Dory that Marlin is tested twice, the first time failing. By not listening to Dory and and not letting go of control, they are both nearly killed by jellyfish. Later in the story, Dory instructs Marlin to “let go” – a phrase with both literal and implied meanings – which Marlin then follows, leading them closer to their destination.

Other examples of Marlin letting go are easily apparent. It is not a coincidence that Marlin and Dory make great progress towards their destination in an undersea current – an ocean “highway” where a traveler submits his control and literally goes with the flow.

For a search movie, “Finding Nemo” is surprisingly devoid of discovering new evidence pointing them towards their goal. Instead, Marlin learns a lot more about coping with loss and learning to let go. Much of his progress comes from trusting other’s judgement, not new clues. Nemo, the metaphor for Marlin’s losses, becomes not a literal goal, but a figurative goal. This point is emphasized by the end of the movie in the last shot. The last lines of the movie are not words of finally coming back together; instead, they are words of good bye. The metaphor of Nemo is fully realized as he fades into the deep blue sea, and Marlin comes to terms with the losses in his life.

Exhibit B: There is no Earth in the Star Wars galaxy. However, there *is* a planet full of Chewbaccas. Logic dictates that the Chewbacca planet is actually Earth.

Chewbacca's ancestors must have led a successful ""Bigfoot Revolution"" and taken over the planet. Or maybe they hid in the forest while we nuked one another. Some of the humans escaped to space to become Space People like Luke and Han. After a long time, they forgot where they came from and settled in space instead. That's why Han can understand Chewbacca: the Chewbacca language is a derived from English, the same language that the humans speak.

So why do they say that Star Wars is set long ago in another galaxy? Bigfoot propaganda. Star Wars is from the future and it is a documentary. We need to stop fighting each other and start fighting the real enemies, the Bigfoots, unless we want Star Wars to become true. George Lucas may be some sort of Bigfoot hybrid, which would explain the beard and the lack of writing skills.

Also, the Ewoks aren't a separate species, they're simply Chewbacca children.

""The mother"" killed herself because she caught Ted and Robin sleeping together and was unable to cope with the grief of not only her marriage falling apart but being betrayed by one of their closest friends.
   Ted goes into great detail, describing a series of relationships, drunken escapades, and sexual conquests (http://i.imgur.com/OBPMuN7.jpg) prior to meeting their mother so his children will understand he has always had a problem. Now throughout the explanation he uses lofty rhetoric about their chance meeting. This is because he does still love his wife and she gave him two beautiful kids which he loves too. Offset this with how Ted describes Barney,(Robin's Husband) by making him out to be a crass, sexaholic sociopath that sleeps with girl after girl (over 250 and counting I believe). 
   On the other hand, he portrays himself as a wide eyed romantic, the blue french horn, the superdate, the string quartet, the 2 minute date. He talks about telling Robin ""I love you"" the first time they met. He makes sure to mention how he had previously cheated on Victoria with Robin, as well as seduced the wife of his boss (the captain) establishing a precedent, and constantly mentions how these romantic feelings for Robin continue to reappear. He makes himself out as a victim by bringing up being left at the altar. Despite doing the same thing to Victoria and Klaus. Finally Ted gives this monologue at the end of the most recent episode: 

All that is 45 days away. But I’m here now, I guess, because I want those extra 45 days... with you, I want each one of them. Look, and if I can’t have them, I’ll have the 45 seconds before your boyfriend shows up and punches me in the face, because I love you. I am always going to love you. Until the end of my days... and beyond. You’ll see.

In 1958 soon after the business named Burger King opened, one model employee showed so much enthusiasm he continually worked a 7 day week. He would even request to spend the night at the restaurant, managers had to refuse and the boy would look disappointed.


The boy never showed any changed his work ethic even when emotions were high. Nobody guessed he had just lost both his parents and had become homeless.

After a few years constantly pushing himself to far in the poor working conditions he became disfigured, thanks to the poorly-contained sizzling fryer grease and the flame-grilling machine. It was of little concern and he worked even harder than before. Time passed by and unknown chemical reactions from the deep fat fryer had damaged his respiratory system.

 The Owner and the board decided the boy was abusing himself on purpose, he knew to much and could ruin image of Burger King. A unanimous decision was made and the boys vocal chords were removed so he couldn't speak out against the company, in return he is now paid millions to be their mascot.

Years go by and The King is forever trapped with the dark knowledge of the truth about his corporate masters, never to be understood by the ignorant masses.

He appears on TV and restaurants presenting people with food. Desperately using visual aid because of his voiceless state he tries to tell his story and the horrifying truth, customers however just laugh and smile. completely oblivious that he is really trying to tell them how eating their food is addictive, dangerous and slowly poisoning them to death.

1371554983.0,48,self.ShittyFanTheories,1gku5e,Tony Stark made up the Avengers movies which aren't Iron Man,The_Darknut_Rises,56,8,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/1gku5e/tony_stark_made_up_the_avengers_movies_which/,"I realised this after watching Iron Man 3. It showed that Tony a) enjoys telling stories (often about himself) and b) enjoys being a hero. So my theory is this all the films which don't have Iron Man in the title are stories Stark tells his kids (except The Incredible Hulk, I'll explain in a minute).


**Iron Man 1-3:** All happen. Including the bits with Nick Fury, Stark genuinely doesn't qualify for the Avengers Initiative so we never find out what it really is. Stark makes up his own version and sets it between 2 and 3 because Fury doesn't appear in 3. It's in 3 he actually finds he enjoys the whole hero thing.


**The Incredible Hulk:** Happens. Tony takes a scientific interest mainly because of his close friend who by a staggering coincidence happens to be called Bruce Banner (and is played by Mark Ruffalo). The Bruce Banner played by Edward Norton is a separate character who is actually the Hulk but is never seen again after the end of the film.


**Thor:** One of Tony's favourite stories as a child, the god of thunder sparked his interest in electricity and forms of energy (pun intended). When he tells the story he updates it to a modern setting so he can then tell the story of how he fought alongside Thor (because his ego's just that big). Hawkeye appears because bows would have actually been a useful weapon at the time of the original myth. As a former weapons designer its not hard for Tony to update said bow to keep it (somewhat) relevant.


**Captain America:** Happens much as appears in the film except for the frezing in ice and being thawed out in time to join Iron Man and Thor in their battle for Earth bit. Once again Tony added this because of his ego. The reason he knows so much about the Captain is because of his father Howard Stark.


**The Avengers:** Tony's favourite story to tell to his children. He explains how he became a hero by repeated comparison to actual legendary heros (ego) and also covers up the fact that he wasn't allowed to be part of the Avenger Initiative (whatever that really was). He casts his friend Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) who is also the children's godfather as the Hulk because a) he has no idea who the actual Hulk is and b) if the kids are misbehaving he can threaten to tell uncle Bruce, who will then turn into a big green monster.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_1gku5e,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/1gku5e/tony_stark_made_up_the_avengers_movies_which/,

I contend that Link, in every game in the series, actually has a biological condition where he has not one, not two, not four, but *three* hearts pumping blood inside his body.

This sounds like a mere joke until you realize: this guy goes adventuring for *days* at a time without stopping to sleep or even really to rest, and let me tell you, running around overtly complicated temples and fighting monsters for hours on end can be physically grueling. How does he get all that energy? I'm clearly not an anatomy expert, but I'd wager that having three hearts constantly pumping blood inside you would give you a great boost.

Now this brings up the question of metabolism: wouldn't this guy have to eat a lot to sustain himself? Well, he does! When enemies in the game leave behind hearts after you kill them, you can run over them and they instantly refill some health. But how do they do that? The only explanation I can think of is that Link *eats* the hearts of his foes. As even a casual player could tell you, you have to do a lot of killing in the game, so he could theoretically be eating *hundreds* of hearts. At this rate, he'd never get tired ... especially when he takes down a huge boss and gets what the game calls a ""Heart Container,"" but what Link calls ""breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next week.""

On that note, this raises a disturbing question: why would such a nice, heroic guy do something as vile as consuming the organs of his fallen enemies? Well, maybe after living his whole life knowing of his condition, he developed some unhealthy obsession with hearts. Or maybe that's just what happens when you're a child sent to save a life from a villain way more powerful than you and you have to spend your every waking moment taking lives.

So basically, Link does not merely get heart containers ... Link is *THE* Heart Container.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_1c96fp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/1c96fp/the_legend_of_zelda_link_actually_has_three_hearts/,

Captain America- lee plays a gay army captain who comments  to his colleague "" I thought he'd be taller.""

Avengers-plays a run of the mill perv who hangs around the park. On the screen below him a kid at the skate park wears a captain America costume made by lee in return for sexual favours.

My guess is sperm-man will eventually gather all the female super heroes who wear his costumes and inform them that by wearing the suits they are going to have his super babies who will be evil as he is. It will be called the receivers and Loki will be his bitch.

People lose time , they lose the ability to identify people they've met before. Their memories just seem to vanished as if they had been erased.

But what if they're just victims of the neuralyzer? We know from them going to Cape Canaveral and Agent K's relocation to  Turo , Massachusetts in Mib 2 that they are active all across america. We also know that the nerualzyer erases memories just Alzheimer.

Yet in no point in  the three film series do we see the MiB do any sort of testing on the long term effects of using the nerualzyer. They don't even do follow up exams with the people they use it on. They just zap you and then let you go on your way like nothing happened.

What makes this even worse is that the MiB didn't even invent the nerualzyer. They got it from some of their Alien friends as mentioned by K in the first movie. Alien friends who probably didn't have many opportunities  to study the long term effects  their new invention had on human subjects.


Then there's the fact that for the most part Alzheimer is a disease most people get in their mid-sixties which means that the MiB wouldn't even notice the effects the nerualzyer had on people immediately. It would take years or even decades for them to notice and they're most likely fighting off alien invasions or  illegal aliens to remember or notice.



Hell , They don't even know (most of) the people whose memories they erase what their names are or anything.

If the ultimate question is ""What is the ultimate question?"" how can ""42"" be the answer? ""42"" isn't even a question! It's a number!

But, is it any ordinary number? No! In fact, is it not the very number that led us towards asking the question as to what the ultimate question is?

So what if it leads us to the answer? Why did Deep Thought say that it is the answer?

Think back. Deep Thought didn't. Remember the question asked to it : What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?

Why is the answer 42? Let me explain using an example.

Imagine that your father is standing behind you. A friend is standing ahead of you. You do not know that your father stands behind you. You ask your friend who is standing behind you. What will the friend answer? There are multiple answers to the question. ""Your father"", ""Look behind you"", ""Why don't you turn around?"", etc.

It was... It was just different. I couldn't explain it. But I was certain that my eyes were somehow deceiving me, that the Twister on the screen was not the Twister I had grown to know and love. I opened my suddenly dry mouth and voiced my doubt out loud. ""That... That's not Twister...""

I watched the show for maybe thirty more seconds before I realized that something awful had happened to Twister. His image was right there on the screen. IT WAS RIGHT THERE. But... Someone else had occupied his body. Twister was worse than dead, he was an empty shell. He no longer loved his hat, he simply wore it out of habit. Shredding meant nothing to him anymore, it was just a way to fuck bitches. I shuddered and turned off the TV. Then I sat there for two hours staring at my warped reflection, coming to terms with the fact that my childhood had just been abruptly snuffed out.

But the show was actually fucked up all along. Check out these pictures.

Rather than ""friendship"", it seems more plausible that E.T. is benefiting from the use of the Force. Like ""friendship"", the Force is a a power that surrounds us, binds us, etc., but unlike friendship, has demonstrable effects (e.g. levitating shit). When E.T. says ""I'll be right here"", he doesn't just mean in Elliot's memories/heart; he literally will be with him with his Force powers that manifest everywhere (similar to Jedi masters appearing to their students after they die, Luke ""talking"" to Vader despite not being close enough to actually talk, etc.). E.T. has mastered the Force.

E.T. even takes place in our own universe, while still being in the Star Wars universe. Although the Star Wars setting - ""a galaxy far far away"" - is, well, far, far away from us, the story events did occur a long time ago, giving them time for technological advancement to reach us.

The peace is largely due to the cult of skaters, lead by the great prophet Coach Frank, which seeks to combine car and human into a single race that retains the agility and flexibility of humans with the speed and power of cars. The skaters undergo complex ceremonies and trials to show their devotion to the cult, performing tricks and utilizing advanced pre-war technologies such as body shop, bookmarking, and telekinesis. After a long period of time, the cult of the skaters has expanded across the world, and through unknown technological means they have finally combined cars and humans into a single species that is both biological and mechanical.

The answer is simple, everyone is made of sponge and asexual. You see, the characters take loads of universal damage and yet are still able to function after attacks that would destroy planets, sponges are notorious for taking loads of damage and still remaining in one piece, example; Spongebob. Even Buu takes advantage of his powers and uses pieces from his body to stay intact. As for senzu beans those are just water-growing sponges in a capsule. They're like the kind that are usually in shapes like dinosaurs that you water so they can grow bigger. This heals them internally and gives them strength again because it's a new reformed sponge replacing the damaged sponge inside of them. Also, the reason why some characters can't regrow their limbs is because their body is made of a type of sponge that is susceptible to contracting red band syndrome from too much ki damage. If an arm is cut off using a destructo disc or a sword their limbs spew out a dark red colored liquid which is the red band syndrome disease damaging the sponge. The disease damages the sponge and makes it weaker, unable to grow back limbs.

tl;dr the characters in the dbz universe can sustain so much damage because they're made of sponge

Also a quick note, to explain why we see genitalia in some episodes of db or dbz; The reason being since they live on the surface and have human shaped bodies is because they still do some human things, like expelling waste and eating food as mammal sponges would do. When male genitalia is seen on the show it's always very small. That's because since they do not use them to reproduce they just stay the same size their entire life.

So we all know and love ""Scrubs"". As a joke I told my friends I thought JD was an imaginary character, but the more I thought about it, it seems plausible.

""Scrubs"" is portrayed as a show following new doctors, but it is actually a show about Turk coping with a new, high-stress job. He leaves college and starts up as a surgeon in a struggling hospital. Unable to quickly make a name for himself, he invents JD as an imaginary friend. Whenever Turk is in trouble, he imagines JD having a good time to cheer himself up; whenever Turk is bored, he imagines JD going on an adventure to amuse himself; when Turk gets married, Carla gets annoyed with JD ""living"" with them, but this is easily explained as Turk's psychological rationalization of Carla's reaction to Turk talking non-stop about a made up person.

In the pilot, when Turk and JD meet Elliot, Turk asks (in a sexually interested way) ""Are you medical or surgical?"" When Elliot says she's a medical intern, Turk gets a little sad because his ""in"" with her is now gone. So he imagines JD hooking up with her, to fulfill Turk's desire of sexual conquest, but only vicariously through fantasy.

During the season of Turk's wedding, a running theme is the stress of planning a wedding. JD once again becomes an emotional outlet. While Turk is bogged down in DJ reservations, tux rentals, and wedding invites, JD is still living the single life, and still hooking up with new, hot women.

When Turk's career does not progress as quickly as he wants, JD gets a promotion. Except despite the position being intended for one person and Elliot getting the job, JD gets the job too, something that is highly unusual for any job. However, if Turk were imagining JD, he could give JD any job he wanted.

The show also offers no reason behind Janitor tormenting Turk. It shows the story behind JD getting hassled, but if we accept that JD is imaginary, then we know that Turk actually initiated the pranks, and with no justification. That last part is important, because it also explains why Janitor's retaliation seems so mean. It's not that he's borderline insane and hassling young doctors; a young doctor began pranking him out of nowhere, and then yelling about someone who doesn't exist as his rationale.

And finally, the ultimate sign of JD existing in Turk's mind, is JD's baby. As a delusional person, Turk imagines JD but as his best friend. So he naturally identifies with JD. This goes to an extreme when JD has a child. Turk has gotten married and has a daughter, but JD as stayed single. Once a family man, Turk's mindset becomes very far removed from where it was as a single bachelor, rooming with his bestie. Unable to imagine what single guys do anymore, and also unable to have JD marry anyone since he isn't real, JD suddenly fathers an unexpected baby to make his life more similar, and easy to imagine, to Turk's. Hell even after JD's baby is born, the mother is rarely seen.

So I posit, therefore, that JD is a delusion of Turk.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_1jcutm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/1jcutm/on_the_tv_show_scrubs_jd_is_a_figment_of_turks/,

For this reason, he acquired a time turner (remember all of his connections with powerful wizards?) and went back to the 1950's to when Willy Wonka was in his prime. For a while indulging himself on Wonka sweets was enough for him, but buying all these delectable sweets was expensive, and Slughorn also loved money. Finally he came to a perfect solution: he would manufacture Wonka sweets, that way he could eat them to his heart's content and make money off of it! Using the fake name Slugworth (a name too similar to Slughorn to be a coincidence) and magic, he quickly opened up a factory that could be run to undercut Wonka's prices (because he could simply run the factory by magic) and he stole  the recipes to Wonka's candies himself, using a simple disillusionment charm to remain undetected, as well as others when he needed to ask workers questions or make them forget they saw him. Wonka thought one of his workers was a mole, so he shut down the factory, but there never was a mole, just an invisible intruder. Now you say, ""aha! but when he reopened with oompa loompas Slugworth (Slughorn) could no longer steal candy!"" But you see, he simply had to pretend he could no longer steal because otherwise Wonka would get suspicious as to how he could possibly still get the secrets, and Slughorn's whole gig could be found out, possibly revealing the existence of the entire wizarding world. After Wonka handed the still closed-off factory to Charlie, Slughorn's business became increasingly untenable, as he had no clue how to make new recipes for himself. (suspicious that a normal candy maker wouldn't do this, isn't it?) Finally, he shut down, gave up his fake name, and turned time forward back to his own time. That is how we came to know the fat, morally-loose (caused by his years of telling himself that what he was doing to Wonka was ok, we later see this tactic with the memory of Tom Riddle that he tampers with) individual we meet in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.

For starters, consider the fact that Winnie the Pooh has an uncanny obsession for honey.  No matter how much he waddles through life and ""Oh, bother!""ing, the constant in his life his honey.  In effect, honey is his main vice.  Now, how does he obtain said honey?  Why, by no other means than by stealing the honey of bee-hives.  The proletariat bees are thus oppressed under the omnipresent bourgeoisie Pooh Bear.  Their hard work thus only benefits Pooh, at their personal detriment.  Though they can mount a considerable effort by working together under a unified, non-competitive bee-hive coalition (i.e., using their stingers now and then against Pooh), they are ultimately outdone by the fat bear's eating disorder.  The 1% of the population controls 50% of the biomass.  

Furthermore, as evidenced http://knowledgeguild.wordpress.com/2012/10/13/the-mental-disorders-of-winnie-the-pooh-characters/, every main character within the 100 Acre Woods has some type of mental disorder.  I won't go through all of them; read them for yourself.  The point is, the deficiencies amongst the main characters (bourgeoisie) represent the deficiencies in a capitalist society.  All the characters are therefore degenerate, thus making the position of the worker bees appear as a constant, normal state of bee-ing.  Unfortunately, their hard work at the hive only goes for the purpose of benefiting one of the few bourgeoisie overlords; a silly-willy, bumbling fat-cat with mental issues. 

In sum, Winnie the Pooh illustrates the iniquities of capitalist society, and is an elaborate anti-capitalist propaganda scheme created by the Russians during Soviet rule.  There is therefore no other option- Worker Bees of the World, UNITE!

book written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg. But after watching again, certain things have 
come to light and it feels as if the film adaptation of this christmas tale might actually be more
attributed to the holocaust. The first point I'm going to make is rather obvious; the train is eerily 
similar to the trains that transported the unfortunate to the concentration camps. Also, the main 
character, who grows up to be Tom Hanks, is wearing a blue robe that is similar to the kind of robes 
worn by the people who were funneled into the concentration camps. Also, the North Pole's buildings 
and such remind me a lot of a concentration camp (specifically like the one in Life is Beautiful, 
because I also recently watched that). 

Taking that into account, the whole christmas theme is still left. I think that the christmas in this 
film actually represents the holocaust, and the remembrance of the holocaust is what the film's real 
message is. The bell that the boy receives from santa serves as a reminder of the holocaust, and as 
he grows older, the people around him remove it from memory, but he still believes. This is just a 
theory though, and I maybe reading too far into it.

In Office Space, thepsychotic episode suffered by Peter is one of inner-peace, and so the character takes direct action, and channels his rage in more healthy ways.

Their love interests, Marla and Joanna, both suffer in the same way as the protagonist - Marla by being addicted to support groups, and Joanna by working a mundane job she hates.  That they both are so equivocal to the protagonist implies that either they are either not real, or they are delusional vision of a less compatible person the protagonist is actually involved with.

The primary point which ties the two stories together, is that the narrator works for a ""major car company"" and is tasked with evaluating the failure rate of automotive parts which result in accidents.  While in Office Space, Peter is consistently tasked with ambiguous ""TPS reports"" and any automotive professional will know that TPS is shorthand for Throttle Position Sensor - a crucial part, which may result in an accident if defective as cruise control function depends on it greatly.

The stories are of the same person, at the same job, with a story arc divergence exploring the results of two coping methods - a yin and yang of mania and dimensia.  This leads to different interpretations of Marla/Joanna suffering in the same way that they are, different methods of rejecting their office environment, but in the end, the same result of bankrupting their antagonistic companies, a healthy relationship and new career path.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_14aemv,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/14aemv/office_space_and_fight_club_are_two_stories_of/,

In fact, going to the future has little consequence (unless your time machine is stolen), since whatever you do there doesn't effect the present. So it was an easy ploy to abduct Marty and Jennifer in order to rape Jennifer.
Doc used this device in front of Marty on his girlfriend to see if Marty was down for a gang bang rape. Marty wasn't down, so Doc had to think of something else.

He puts Jennifer in an alley and to just ""leave her there"". Saying she will be fine. Doc then tells Marty to go into the Cafe 80s. This is when Doc rapes Jennifer. (We don't see either Doc nor Jennifer for a while during the whole Marty vs Griff act).

The events of the Toy Story movies are her outlet from the awful existance she leads. The toys that she cannot afford would all be available to Andy. Andy would be smart, fun, and would be nice to his sister. Woody and Bo Peep represent toys she had access to, where as Buzz and newer toys she could only dream of having. Her fanciful dreams represent her world and what she dreams of having. The abuse from her father continues through the first movie as the family moves to escape him at the end.

Poor Hannah is subjected to life with this pedophile and becomes even more disenchanted with life at the end of TS2.

Toy Story 3 is then basically Hannah coming to terms with growing up and how nothing in her life will get any better. During some point before TS3 Sid is kicked out of the house (becoming a garbage man), Big Al and Hannah's mother are divorced, and Hannah lives at home with her mom. She witnesses a young neighbor she knows from the Day Care she works at, and takes an interest in the child. The child shows signs of abuse (bruises/withdrawn) and she shares her magical world of toys with the child, to help her deal with her problems.

Apologies if that's not cool.

I was reading recently about Robert Downey Jr's Iron Man contract being up soon and the possibility of him or the studio opting not to renew it.

But how can anyone live up to RDJ? I hear you ask. Here's how.

It's the end of the credits of Avengers 2 a scene opens of Tony Stark sitting on the balcony of his Mountainside Villa. A sudden deafening crash occurs. As the dust settles it reveals a space ship the doors open and a bright beam of light silhouettes a figure that doesn't quite look human. It speaks.
""Are you Tony Stark? The one they call Iron Man?""

Tony: ""Who wants to know. Or what wants to know?""

""There is a threat to our planet and a prophecy has foretold that you are the only one who can help us.""

Tony:""You sure it was me. I have one of those faces"".

""You must come with me.""

Tony:."" Thanks but my mother told me to never get in cars with strange men and this is on a whole other level."" 

""I wasn't asking."" 

He raises his tentacle and Tony visibly under mind control follows him into the ship. it takes off and the screen cuts to black

Ok. That's how we get rid of him.
Then. The Return.

A few years later and it'S Captain America 3 or whatever. 
Another end of credits scene
A desert at night Army men tanks and missiles are everywhere. slowly but surely we see something hurtling towards earth. The army men man the missiles ready to fire when one with a telescope screams 

""Stop! Don't fire!"" (could be coulson if they've brought him back.)
""It's him. I never thought we'd see him again.""
Iron man comes into sight
quickly at first before slowing to a smooth landing in the middle of the troops and officials.
He removes his mask.

Al

FUCKING

PACINO

Tony: ""Miss me?""

He was off in a distant Galaxy for years and because of the distance Time wasn't consistent in whatever world he was in. He aged differently than time on earth. While only three years passed in our Solar System it could have been 40 in that one. Bamn Al Pacino is Iron Man now.
Now you have an Iron Man who's not even comparable to RDJ so you get around the whole ""living up"" to the performance thing. And you have an Iron Man who's spent half a life time working for Aliens. Whole new set of issues (a comicbook tie-in of his time in the distant galaxy) and he can have Alien tech.

I haven't seen the Johnny Depp version, so I won't include it. It has also been years since I've seen the film and longer since I've read the books. The kind folks in /r/fantheories have already pointed out the problems, but that's just Wonka propaganda. Humanity isn't ready for this to be revealed.

Let's face it: Wonka is messed up. He opens his factory after years of shut gates and four out of five children meet their maker within its sugar-producing walls. This is strange, simply because Wonka's reactions to the deaths are so...accepting. Why is this?

Why is Wonka's chocolate considered *so good?*

It's because Wonka built his chocolate factory over the sleeping body of an Elder God, and infuses his chocolate with the Elder Gods essence.

Whether it's Cthulhu, Yog-Saron, whoever, it doesn't matter, Wonka- at some point early in his life, most likely while building his chocolate factory- stumbled upon the resting spot of one of the Great Old Ones and that first contact shattered his mind.

He withdrew from society and spent years building up his chocolate factory as a sort of prison for this eldritch horror sleeping within the earth. He eventually recovered from the insanity and realized that the monster was stirring.

He did some research into the abominations of the universe, and learns that the Elder God requires sacrifice every decade or so. But not just any sacrifice.

This Elder God feeds off emotion, and what emotions are stronger than joy suddenly turned to horror? And who feels emotions stronger than children?

It's also during these studies that Wonka realizes that he can't keep this up forever. The constant proximity to the Elder God's dreams is causing Wonka to slowly fade from existence. He needs a replacement, and soon, in order to train him.

In order to facilitate this, Wonka begins his Golden Ticket promotion. The Elder God senses that his time is near, and begins drawing all of humanity to the tickets. It eventually lures five children and their families to the factory.  Wonka leads them through the factory, trying to weed out the four that he'll sacrifice. His first real test is that psychedelic boat tunnel that passes through one of the chambers of the Elder God. Wonka takes note of the four that seem most likely to experience the strongest emotions. He uses his agent, Slugworth, to determine whether Charlie has the selflessness to essentially run a one-man sacrificial Elder God cult.

As they go through the factory, Wonka sacrifices each child in sequence until Charlie is the only one left and the Elder God is appeased. Wonka congratulates him, though deep in his heart he knows that he has destroyed any chance for this boy to have a normal life. Wonka tells him his family will move into the factory, and they leave in the elevator to begin his training.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_uqhn7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/uqhn7/this_belongs_here_more_than_in_the_normal/,

You can find the post [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/futurama/comments/13kdpq/one_of_tony_starks_suits_looks_a_lot_like_my/)


Tony Stark is Bender. He was frozen around the same time as Fry (possibly earlier), testing a prototype of one of his other suits. This suit was a little clunky, so he knew it would have some flaws. Stark began testing in the Applied Cryogenics area (a new branch of Stark Industries) as this was a wide, nearly empty room ideal for testing flaws. Stark then, of course, made the same mistake that Fry did -- tripping (likely due to a fault in the suit) and freezing himself by accident.


He then finds himself in the year 3000, albeit in a strange robot suit. He becomes severely depressed. Stark has lost his company, his money, all the glory he gained from being a ""superhero"". This is why when Fry meets ""Bender"" for the first time, he is about to commit suicide in a Suicide Booth. When Fry convinces him to stick around, instead of revealing who he actually is, Stark decides to stay in the suit, hoping that perhaps one day... he might be able to regain all of that glory as a superhero.

Here's more CON-SPIRACIES to rattle your brain, muhuhahahahaha:

* **Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory** is in the future and the Oompa Loompas are former cast members of Jersey Shore. The entire movie is a social commentary.

* **Pokémon &amp; Yu-Gi-Oh** are in the same universe. Actually, it's the same story being told by different cultures (futuristic Japan &amp; Egypt respectively). This is evidenced by the fact that the fate of the world is constantly in the hands of unsupervised children and sad lonely adults playing turn-based combat games in a world without a shred of economy or government system.

* The **Indiana Jones** series started as a loose parody of a Bollywood character, India Jones. He was meant to satirize closeted homosexual American archaeologists (hence the whip and man-purse). Additionally, the Indy 500 takes their name from India Jones in a scene where he's chased by 500 native Indians. The scene then inspired the movie **""300""** which felt that cutting the cast down to 300 would save money, but they would ""ramp up the gayness"" by dressing everyone in codpieces and setting it in Ancient Greece.

* **Spongebob Squarepants** is a kid-friendly American adaptation of the hentai *Dōuçhekåï Nįkâta nō Go!* It followed a douchebag and it's adventures with the anus (represented by a starfish), vagina (represented by a beaver), pubic lice (represented by crabs), and, as in traditional Japanese hentai, the octopus tentacles that would routinely make its way out of the girl. The series was a flop that had its footage sold at an Anime Expo auction in 1995. Eventually it found its way to Stephen Hillenburg who was then inspired to make it a child-friendly cartoon. 

*  Pepé Le Pew was originally supposed to be a suave **James Bond**-esque character. When the owners of the Bond franchise threatened to sue, Chuck Jones rewrote him as a cat rapist as a giant ""F you"" to them.

* Inception characters represent the **seven deadly sins**: Dom Cobb is gluttony (he's addicted to shared dreaming), Robert Fisher is wrath (towards his father of course), Eames is sloth (he lazily fabricates anything he wants in dreams), Ariadne is lust (for knowledge!!!), Arthur is pride (that guy walks around zero gravity dreams like he owns the place), and Saito is greed &amp; envy (against Fisher's company).

* In fact, everything is the seven deadly sins. Everything. And if you're gonna disagree with me, you're a greedy, envious, angry, lazy bastard.

* **Quentin Tarantino** is actually Roger Federer. His movies are all allegories of his struggles as a tennis player and the harsh gambling crime-syndicate culture of tennis player management.

* **Prometheus** was actually the race started by Dr. Manhattan. We inadvertently created our creators. It's a causality loop. Don't you dare question me you prideful fat nerd who's probably whacking it on a Google Chrome Incognito window!

* **Hey Arnold!** follows the story of poor kids in the ghetto and how it affects their future. The titular character of the show eventually has an illegitimate child with a married woman from Rhode Island. That child's name: Stewie Griffin. His insistence on cross-dressing is a subconsciously inherited trait from his father, who used to wear a kilt.

* That's not all. The fat bully from Hey Arnold!, Harold Berman, goes on to abandon several illegitimate children himself, one of which develops a deep-rooted hatred for Jewish people: Eric Cartman. His mother's suggestion that she is the father was to spare him the pain of discovering his true ancestry.

* **Samuel L. Jackson** plays a black guy in every single movie he's in. Yes, even in Pulp Fiction.

* When **Leonardo Dicaprio** dies at the end of *Titanic* he wakes up in a dream onto the beach of *Inception*. When he wakes up from that dream and gets off of the plane, he starts going on the run in *Catch Me If You Can*. After he's caught, he wakes up into another dream and then goes undercover to investigate the mob in *The Departed*.

In Lord Of The Rings, there IS magic but it's not so advanced, and in Harry Potter we also have magic way less subtle than in LOTR.

So, we could say that these three works of fiction by different authors, with films directed by different people and played by not even remotely related actors are related.

Think about it: the start of the world is in LOTR, with the arts of magic still being explored and learned. Wizards use their forces subtly and they are still seeing how far they can go with their power (Think Sauron).

Some time since the War of The Ring, wizards start to be less common to see everywhere. Elves and Dwarves go extinct or have physical mutations. Humans start to reproduce and go to war with dwarves, wiping them out. The remains of them create midgets, and some recessive genes are carried until today. Elves are enslaved and breeded selectively by some secret organization of old wizards of sorts. This is somewhere around 6000 years ago.

When the wizards reach complete obscurity, and elves are fully converted into domestic ones, the backstory for Harry Potter starts to come to life: a secret world of wizards formed a long time ago (Middle Earth). They still had contact with the outside world, though, but not as much as they used to. Now that wizards are starting to hide, technology starts to advance more slowly.

The ancient school of wizardry (Not being flashy about magic) loses force and wizards adopt wands instead of staffs. Some time later, Lord Voldemort finds The One Ring, and starts to get corrupted by it. He desired to be the most powerful wizard in existence, and it helped him to achieve that. But the ring is rusted for being over 7000 years in the open, so it isn't as powerful as it once was. That's why he needs the Horrocruxes.

After Harry kills Voldemort, more changes happen to society: by 2060 man has a colony in the Moon, in 2063 the warp drive is discovered and by 2070 we have a colony in Mars. Approximately in the year 4000, after humanity spread so much throughout the Galaxy, the wizards make themselves known to The Federation.

Now that The Galaxy Federation has a power unseen ever by the human race in all of its history, the inevitable decay starts to happen, but not without an invention: The Lightsaber. This is where they stop using wands and come in contact with the muggles, changing all perceptions about being a mudblood that existed. At about the same time, sales for wizard's tea dropped by about 200%, causing everyone to wonder how or why.

Fast forward 1500 years, and memory of humanity's first home was forgotten a long time ago. War destroyed lots of valuable resources to move forward the human race, so now they are very sparse to be economically viable to mine them. Lots of worlds have been disconnected and mapped as ""Wild zones"", due to lack of resources. The wizards still have breeded amongst themselves, causing mild speech retardation. This also causes personality changes that make them more prone to be shy about their magic, so they start doing it without special effects (that consumed a lot of energy, so they had to eat a lot)

In between all this war, the wizards are now called ""Jedi"" due to a translation error. 2000 years after that, the Star Wars happen. And the movie is the tale an old man tells to his grandson, and that's why it's a long time ago.

**TL;DR:** In LOTR, the mages were exploring uses of magic. In Harry Potter, they've hidden and use flashy magic, even if that's paradoxical.  After Star Trek happens, they reveal themselves to humans. Then comes political change, blah blah blah, and Star Wars happens.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_un8v6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/un8v6/lord_of_the_rings_star_wars_star_trek_and_harry/,

It’s become something of a pop culture talking point to speculate on the contents of the enigmatic case. While we never explicitly see what’s inside there are a few things that we can deduce based on how characters act in relation to it. 

We can assume it’s some kind of tradable commodity of considerably high value given that the cohort of young men in the apartment are willing to risk incurring the wrath of a fearsome mobster for it. They were involved in some kind of deal, yet their covetous desire to possess the briefcase overwhelmed their instincts of self preservation, leading them to go ahead with screwing over a dangerous gangster. It was a risk they paid for with their lives. 

Not only do we know the contents are of high value, we can also deduce that it is aesthetically striking in a pleasing manner. This is strongly implied by Pumpkin’s dialogue upon getting a look inside the case in the diner robbery scene towards the end of the film:

                                     PUMPKIN
                              (softly)
                         Is that what I think it is?

               Jules nods his head: ""yes.""

                                     PUMPKIN
                         It's beautiful.


In asking “Is that what I think it is?” Pumpkin illustrates that it’s a substance he is at least somewhat familiar with. Given the circles he moves in, this of course could be anything from cocaine to heroin or indeed a bundle of cash, but none of these things could reasonably be thought of as “beautiful” and certainly wouldn’t warrant such a degree of incredulity.

Indeed, we see that Vincent is visibly moved by the contents of the case when he pops it open in the apartment at the beginning. He’s taken aback, bathed in its golden aura and stunned into a kind of awed silence. Jules has to repeatedly ask him if everything is alright before he manages to break his reverie, at which point Vince emphatically declares “Yeah, we happy"" and exhaling, almost overwhelmed. 

So based on this, what can be deduced? What is of extremely high value that can be carried around in a briefcase? What kind of material is aesthetically striking to the point it can be considered “beautiful? And what kind of material appears golden when it catches the light, as it does for Vince when he opens the case? Essentially, what is valuable, beautiful and gold?

It seems quite self evident; Marsellus Wallace is a platinum smuggler.

I mean, Barney claims the ""school"" to be his own, the doors are always open, and nobody is ever in the place. It's a pretty big fucking school if you look at exterior shots. And the place is always unlocked: who the hell leaves a school unlocked and unattended? No teachers or janitors are ever in the place? It's not logical.

My theory: The kids are psychologically abused by their parents, and therefore have to go within their own minds to be happy, except they go together, similar to Sucker Punch.

In the high time of the Tevinter Imperium, the elves were immortal. And as bored, immortal beings, they attempted to become like the Maker in wisdom and power and strength. The Tevinter mages, seeing the pridefulness of the elves, risked everything to reach the Golden City in an effort to warn the Maker that the immortal elves were attempting to recreate themselves in His image.

Unfortunately, the Maker did not give heed to the Tevinter mages, instead casting them down for the hubris that they showed in entering his sacred realm. It was only after casting the Tevinter mages down that the Maker realized his error, but it was too late: the darkspawn had already been let loose upon the world.

The Maker did heed the mages' warning and brought the elves in contact with humanity, the event that would bring about the slow decline of elven civilization. And then the Maker fled, ashamed at his pride and the destruction it would cause in the world.

The death toll is in its millions and still rising.


This will force all the leaders of countries to gather together and find a solution. As the water levels were rising rapidly, more and more lands became inhabitable. After much debate, they will finally come to the consensus that they should rally up the last few remaining humans, and we should abandon our old life on land and instead migrate under the sea. Research soon began, as scientists desperately tried to prepare humanity for its future living conditions. Machines that help us breathe and communicate verbally underwater were quickly invented, and modern technology has even created artificial flame, perfectly waterproof, which can provide warmth for survival as well as act as a light source under the sea.


Living under water is not too big of a challenge for humanity, and we soon settled down and re-established functional societies.

Knapp assumes that the Island of Sodor has to turn a profit and is miraculously ahead of the rest of the world in AI. It's not. 

In the far, post-scarcity future, human warship AIs retire. Choosing an occupation that makes them feel happy, some opt to become trains. The Island of Sodor is the home for these, who live out the rest of their functioning lives under the tender care of Island program director Sir Topham Hatt and the Great Western Railway. 

The GWR exists to keep these AIs sane, functional and alive, when the only alternative is sticking them on a disk somewhere or deleting them, neither acceptable in the mores of the time. 

Going to visit The Other Railway is a reward for good behavior and continued sanity; misbehaving engines are shut in the shed (or a tunnel) until they become compliant. The worst are slowly disassembled. When trains mess up, it's not a major issue, because in post-scarcity human society, we have the resources. The trains choose to think that they keep the island economy running, but it could continue without them. 

The ""middle class"" of Sodor are humans who run the tourism industry on Sodor. Other groups of humans provide support for the GWR, local human-support operations, entertainment, and the like. Sodor has some human tourism spots, like Culdee Fell, the beaches, the cricket fields, but the main draw is the trains.

1.  The reason none of the missiles harmed him is because they were all made of cake, or were the paint missile things from the movie Kelly's Heroes. 

2. The party at the beginning is actually everybody just waiting for the monster to arrive. He was a bit late, as everyone had to walk a couple of blocks and he had to come from outer space. 

3. When everyone goes and hides in the grocery store and turns the lights out, they are again trying to scare the monster into birthday jubilation. However, he is not amused.

And the ending (Spoilers, because this is a fan theory after all)

When you see the monster's face with the two bulging eye sacs, he is actually extremely tired and grumpy because he has been up so much while waiting for his birthday. Also, the nuke is not actually lethal, but a giant cake they are dropping on the Big Bad Birthday Boy to round off his special night!

This becomes immediately clear when you look at the aesthetic changes, which happen at break-neck speed in the beginning of episode 4.

The tone of the dialogue becomes more lighthearted and simplified, the costumes completely change, insignificant protocol droids become indispensable characters, and not to mention, he dies?

I won't bore you with every detail.  The more you think about it, the more it makes sense.  Obi Wan became a raving lunatic after doing death sticks.

At the end of the episode, Arthur thinks Merlin has a crush on the Lady Morgana and he says, ""You can't hide anything from me Merlin."" Merlin has a good chuckle. I thought it was kind of weird that they emphasized how hard Merlin laughed at this. Then I realized that Merlin is a pathological liar. He acts like he's just a stupid servant but he's actually a powerful warlock. He has everyone fooled: Arthur, Gwen, Morgana, even Uther, who hates magic with an undying passion. He's living a complete lie!

Then I got to thinking, how has Merlin not raised suspicion yet? Well that's because the show takes place in a Groundhog Day inspired universe. The characters are living the same day over and over. There are slight changes, but it's essentially the same day repeating itself. First, something sketchy happens, and Gaius suspects magic. Uther dismisses Gaius as crazy. Then Merlin finds proof that it's magic, and makes an ass of himself trying to warn everyone. Then Arthur tries to save the day, but he's a fucking idiot so all he does is nearly get himself killed. Merlin manages to save him just in time, usually in a Deus Ex Machina kinda way that negates the last 40 minutes of developments. Lastly, Merlin and Gaius go back to their house and have passionate sex. 

Some more evidence of Groundhog Day is that the dragon does the exact same thing every time Merlin goes to visit him. I think what happened here was that the dragon was too dangerous to be filming all the time, so they decided to just play the same clip over and over, and modified the premise of the show slightly to explain why it's always the exact same dragon footage.

To prove that it's Groundhog Day, just imagine if it wasn't. Eventually the characters would realize that Gaius is always right, Uther is always wrong, Arthur is always a dick, and Merlin is the worst servant in the history of servants, not to mention a liar. Instead the characters are cursed to live out the exact same day over and over.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,1360113089.0,,,True,t3_17ykcb,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/17ykcb/merlin_is_a_pathological_liar_also_hes_living_in/,

Ron Howard thought it had something to do with childhood bullying, but that's retarded. The narrators theory has something to do with heart size, and honestly that might have something to do with it, but I think The Grinch is just a responsible man who likes to keep to himself, but the Whos all make so much noise that he can't help but hear it from the top of his fucking mountain, which is no good for his weak heart. But the fact is he can't even get away from it on a mountain, where he ACTIVELY tries to stay away from them. You see, the Whos are a bunch of jobless bastards who leach off of the government and get the loud stupid machines he hates without having to work for them. And he is disgusted. Also, they're a bunch of inbred freaks. That's why Cindy-Lou-Who has that Caterpillar-looking body instead of feet. His campaign to steal Christmas back from who he perceives as thieves gives him a heart attack, swelling his heart to three times its normal size. He hurries back to Whoville, seeking medical treatment, which they grant him, provided he return the gifts. The retarded inbred doctors save his life, but at the cost of his hearing, so he stops giving so much of a shit about the deadbeat Whos, and eats the fucking Who pudding with them. 

EDIT* The filthy dirty welfare queen Whos theory is supported by the fact that ALL the Whos houses have mice. And mice-holes that lead directly to the rain gutters.

After the events settled down and they realised the damage the supernatural world was able to do during the time she was inactive the government go about starting several initiatives to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again. The world starts to rebuild and manages to become something like its former self but some cities becoming vastly different. 

One way to combat such a threat in the future is to build facilities around the planet at the locations of the Hellmouths to stop things from other dimensions from entering our world. At this time the effects of the supernatural incursion on the world at large starts to be seen as people start to develop mutant powers. Captain Hammer gains his abilities and Dr. Horrible enters the villain scene. These are pretty small fry so the government does not try to recruit them but when several high profile heroes appear on the scene they put their other plan into action. The Avengers Initiative. 

All is good and peaceful for many years and using the knowledge of these alien beings a great space race starts up. People start leaving the planet and actually colonising space is the the great space age. But then events of Cabin in the Woods happen and the world is plunged into chaos. The seas rise and other natural disasters practically making the planet practically uninhabitable. With no one left to feed on the Old Ones become dormant again allowing the few remaining humans to start re-building leading the events of Waterworld.

However out in space the Earth-That-Was is now remembered as a near myth and without the nexus that was Earth the few colonies out there become fragmented and battle amongst each other. Eventually the two major players who had enough money to seize on the space race forge an agreement to form what becomes known as the Alliance to fight the Unification war and bring these fractured colonies under one rule. 

But one little ship tries to avoid their long reach and Captain Mal Reynolds manages win a great battle against them by revealing the true nature of the Reavers to the outside world. In an attempt to reclaim the hearts of the Alliance they return to Earth and manage to terraform it and make it habitable again. 

But the Reavers knew they would now be hunted and they fly deeper and deeper into unknown space. Now what was thought to be impossible happens. They meet other sentient beings. Five hundred years pass and humanity has become great again. Their reach stretches deeper into space than ever before. But the Reavers did not die but preyed on other planets and grew. One day they ended up facing the Drej and where eventually killed off but it left the Drej with a fear for humans and when they saw that humans were researching something called Project Titan they feared they would use it to attack them again just as the Reavers had.

Now in the movie, we see that he emerges from the explosion, having saved the day, and his son and bartender are in love, and he is back with his life. But this is all a dream hallucination after being sucked up by the water spout and hitting his head against a shark's skull. In truth the sharknados devastated Southern California, leaving Millions dead and causing perpetual environmental damage. More water spouts have erupted, Finley being in one of them, and are dropping Sharks by the thousands upon California. The government, after evacuating all of the citizens, does the only sensible thing and drops a nuclear bomb onto the state to kill the sharks and the water spouts. Within minutes of the explosion, Russia, thinking that it was a test bomb whose kin would be aimed at Moscow, launches a preemptive Nuclear strike onto Washington DC. Israel, France, and England bomb Russia in retaliation, North Korea returns fire, and soon the world is in a deadly nuclear war


. . . .


Meanwhile, the Cyclone has dispersed, and dropped an unconscious Finley into the North Atlantic, where he is frozen into an iceberg. These icebergs float into the crater that was once New York City, being pushed by stray bombs. After several years of this fighting, the Mushroom bomb is dropped, killing most of the remaining life and mutating the rest. Finley, trapped inside this great iceberg lake, only experiences some of the Radiation from the bomb, being protected by the iceberg. However, the iceberg doesn't block all of it, and he mutates into a very strong baby, still unconscious.


. . .



About 1000 years after the Mushroom bomb, Finley washes up on a beach, with no memory of his life as a pro surfer in California. He crawls for about half a day before giving up in the forest and soiling himself. Then, along come Jake's parents. They take baby Finley for their own and raise him to be a great hero along with their own son Jake. As he grows, Finley's hero instincts grow again, a reflection of his Heroism during the Sharknado. As he grows, he shortens his name to Finn, because he doesn't like saying both syllables. However, he has a fear of water, most likely from the sight of a thousand sharks bearing down on him. He also is haunted by the ghost of a woman some believe to be his mother. It's not his mother, it's the ghost of his ex-wife, who drowned shortly after the Sharknado events. That's why she ignores all the other characters in the 'The Creeps' episode, she doesn't know Jake, P-Bubs, BMO, or CB; and she doesn't care about them, she only sees Finn.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,False,,,True,t3_1jun1n,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/1jun1n/rejected_by_rfantheories_maybe_my_connection_of/,

The End of the Line is his rehab experience. (It's the end of his alcoholism.)
Broken Beat and Scarred his him trying to live with being sober when he first comes back to his normal life sober. (He believes he is better while not under the influence of alcohol, and was Broken Beat and Scarred during that time, hence what don't kill you make ya more strong being repeated so much)
The Day that Never Comes is his old addictions coming back to tempt him. (Him believing he'll stay sober, hence the day he returns to alcoholism being ""The Day That Never Comes"")
All Nightmare Long is James' dream and subconscious feelings affecting him. (Hence the pun on Nightmare and it ""Hunting [him] down"")
Cyanide is him considering Suicide for the first time. (Get back onto that in a sec, but the lyrics suit it) 
The Unforgiven III is him hating himself for considering alcohol and hating on his wife. (Him coming to terms with the constant reminder and lust of alcoholism, alcoholism being the ""light of golden treasure"")
Judas Kiss is him wanting to betray his wife and leave her for the booze (Hence Judas being in the name, and not being sure as what to do...Stay sober and married, or drunk and lonely? ""Twisting on the tourniquet, when the pieces never fit"" showing that people are expecting him to stay sober when it doesn't suit him)
Suicide and Redemption is him shortening the story and the like. (Seriously, listen closely to it; maybe it was because I was fairly high at the time but the riffs showed a story of the protagonist starting off bad, getting better but falling to his demons again and being unsure of what to do by the end of the song)
My Apocalypse is the outcome..He's so unsure that it ruins him, causing an internal apocalypse if you will.

As for Beyond Magnetic; Hate Train is the hate of his current life building up from his former self (ie. The alcoholic James), Just a Bullet Away is him contemplating suicide (Midnight Revolver meaning him wanting to commit suicide at midnight when his children are asleep and unable to witness it), Hell and Back being him referring to his wife and sober life being 'hell' during one of the weak moments he has and finally Rebel of Babylon is him voicing his 'rebellious' thoughts of returning to alcoholism (""Rebel, grip your bottle tight, just float away, rebel is it hard to leave, what makes you stay?"")

Escape was James writing about his alcoholism way back when, but now it's being used by his internal desires to stay drunk to announce that they're winning again (""I'll Fight Until The End"" and it actually being played live now) and that he's having a drink or two behind everyones back.

* 11:1 ""...And still not ginger!""

* 8:1 The ""baby's"" identity is publicy deduced by Scotland Yard Consulting Detective Sherlock Homes.  Side bet that Benedict Cumberbatch makes an appearance is at 3-to-1.

* 7:2 Some say that he was born with more hair than Prince William has ever had on his head and that his kicking in the royal womb resembled that of McLaren's best Formula One drivers upshifting around a corner.  All we know is, he's called The Stig.

* 6:1 Bookmaker's favorite: The Archbishop of Canterbury reveals the child to world like Rafiki did with Simba.  Must specify Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, or Tower of London when placing bet.

* 3:1 John Barrowman sings a lively musical number and flashes that smile we all love.

Portrayal of James Bond in movies is different from books. ""One-liners"", delivered by Bond,  exist only in movies.

Bond never laugh on own jokes and usually kills alone, unlike of Ostin Powers. And he usually performs his jokes only after executed enemy already died. (There is also a minor shitty fantheory that he jokes to test that victim really died but it's easy to see flaws in it.)

007's villains also understand movie's reality. For example, every villain revealed own plans every time they captured 007. And this typical scene is absolutely pointless for villain itself because answering Bond's questions can always be risk and only audience need to know real villain's evil plan.

So both James Bond and his every villain are hyper-sane and understand that they live in fictional universe. 007 always have one major villain per movie. Villains often have perfect knowledge of MI6's secrets, they always know James Bond's name which supposed to be secret. They can have such knowledge for sure only if they are James Bond. Identity of villains is revealed only for Bond and in the end they always escape or die.

Our hero has multiple personality disorder. And his alternate personality is always same villain with different names, that explains  Blofeld deaths — it was not doubles/look-a-likes, it was just temporal disappearing of alter ego.

The hobbits, those drug addicts, were made to believe of black horses flying in the sky and the hobbits bit it.

They were meticulously kept away from the fight to spare them the vision of dying children and orc wifes.
Boromir felt sorry for the poor hobbits. He tried to warn them and stop their delusion by stealing the ring. All he got was an arrow in the back.

And while they were sent on a meaningless trip with some crazy amphibian fellow, high on pot the whole way, the orcs peaceful and gentle people were put to death by the thousand by power hungry Gandalf and ambitious soon-to-be-king Aragorn.",,False,self,t5_2u8ej,1353358504.0,,,True,t3_13gvfl,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/13gvfl/nobodies_really_care_for_the_one_ring_except_the/,

It would shift and move away from Bruce as our hero and we'd watch Harvey.

It does. 

Past the events of﻿ him getting blown up, this is all a dream. Harvey is actually still in the hospital. He's in a great deal of pain. The line about the pain medication is not to be taken lightly, even if it is said in the dream world. He may be lucid at times hearing people visit him. Hearing news reports on TV. Real life events are happening in his dream. You can still hear while dreaming. People often incorporate the noises they hear into their dream. This is why we see things on TV all the time. It's on in Harvey's hospital room. 

There's reasons to doubt reality. Why doesn't Harvey call for help when the Joker is talking to him? Why not shoot to wound the Joker? He didn't have to shoot to kill. He's in mourning because of Rachel, he's in﻿ a nightmare, he can't wake up. Even the events of TDKR are all a dream. As Harvey still hasn't been able to wake up. Though 8 years haven't past.

1348257602.0,11,self.ShittyFanTheories,109jfg,Biff Tannen is a shitty terminator model sent back in time by SkyNet.,Sarlax,16,5,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/109jfg/biff_tannen_is_a_shitty_terminator_model_sent/,"TL;DR: In fact, all Tannens are terminators. This is why they have no parents, all look the same, have the same muscular frame as the Arnold model, and singularly oppose Doc Brown and the entire McFly family.

In the original timeline (prior to the events of the first movie), Marty was a rock star in 1997 and John Connor was a big fan of his. In the meantime, Doc Brown was happily time traveling. Then SkyNet attacks. Doc Brown arrived during the war and is captured by SkyNet, who copies the time travel system, but fails to account for the stainless steel construction that allows non-flesh objects to travel through time. 

After Judgment Day, John used Marty’s music to inspire the human revolt. Consequently, Marty became SkyNet’s secondary target, after John. But with humans storming its base, and thinking John was the more dangerous foes, SkyNet could only send its crappiest Terminator model after Marty, the B101, which actually prefers bullying to terminator. It sent the first B101 to 1955. During the human attack, Doc escapes and time travels as well, setting himself up to be the mentor to Marty we see in the first movie.

The B101 arrives in the past and adopts the identity of Biff. With no background or family, “Biff” takes advantage of a mentally ill old woman, claiming to be her grandson (“grandma” from the second film). Biff settles in, and begins bullying George McFly so that no woman will ever want him, and thus intends to prevent the birth of Marty. This fails after George falls and Lorraine falls in love him while taking care of him. Biff, unable to disobey his last instruction to bully George, continues harassing him for 30 years (up to the events that begin the first movie).

Doc, desperate to prevent the rise of SkyNet, makes a deal with terrorists to get plutonium for his time machine so he can take enough trips to travel in time, and thus the first film occurs. After George ends up punching out Biff, Doc captures the powered down B101 and reprograms it to serve George and protect young Marty.
SkyNet, however, sent more than one terminator through time. The first was to strike at Marty through George, but the second was sent after Doc Brown. Thinking Doc went forward in time, SkyNet sent a slightly improved terminator to 2015. The B102 identifies as Griff, and like Biff, has no parents. Griff successfully captures Biff and reprograms him to be loyal to SkyNet again. 

Thus the stage is set for the second film. We even detect the advancements the B102 has over the 101, such as mechanical sound it makes when it rises to fight Marty in the Café 80s, it’s superior strength, and its enhanced reflexes when it grabs Marty’s punch. After Marty defeats Griff, Biff follows Marty and Doc and steals the DeLorean.

Traveling back to 1955, Biff-1 meets himself (Biff-2). With the sports statistics, he enables Biff-2 to start his business empire, and it is BiffCo which will now invent SkyNet, rather than Cyberdyne. He also improves Biff-2’s programming so that Biff-2 will choose to kill more readily kill. Biff-1 returns to 2015 to determine whether it succeeded, but fades out of existence as a consequence of meeting his past self.

Marty and Doc then arrive in the tangent-1985 and confront Biff-2, who maintains the illusion of humanity until BiffCo can invent SkyNet. After defeating Biff-2, SkyNet’s last, desperate act is revealed: A third terminator was sent back to 1885 to wipe out the entire McFly family, which had just immigrated to America.

The Buford B101 was the last to be sent back, and was actually damaged as it traveled. When it arrived in the Old West, it had largely forgotten its mission, and took to killing in a mostly random fashion. Still, with some memories remaining, Buford began bullying Seamus McFly. 

However, Doc Brown, having predicted this by SkyNet, deliberately traveled to the same time at the end of the second film, in order to protect the McFly family.

The truth is far more sinister. The zombie apocalypse has already happened. It started off in some remote area of the world. The government has it under control for now, but they know it's not long until it spills over and everyone knows what's going on. So now the government is trying to desensitize the masses to the zombie hordes. 

Why? To make them easy pickings. One thing about zombie fans, they all think they are going to be the survivors. It is clearly a distraction technique. They let small government funded film crews into the 'zombie fields' to make their propaganda films so that when the time comes, no one will believe there are really zombies.

By examining the original Star Wars Trilogy chronologically, we see a number of borrowed elements from the classic Seinfeld Episode, wherein the protagonist and antagonist are reversed, i.e. The Empire is representative of Jerry and friends, while the Rebel Alliance is a representation of the court and the people of Pennsylvania.

1) **The Empire was preparing for the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion and mistakenly discredited as simply wreaking havoc throughout the galaxy.** A direct parallel to Jerry and friends being accused of being criminals, when in reality they were simply making their way to California for the filming of ""Jerry!""

2) **The Rebel Alliance called upon the help of many heroes who had personal dealings with the Empire previously.** Strikingly similar to the prosecution in the Seinfeld case calling upon the numerous character references, the Rebel Alliance called upon Obi Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi, and eventually Yoda to help them fight the Empire. Speaking of Yoda...

3) **Yoda is short, bald, and otherwise unattractive.** Although the characters aren't direct parallels, one can't help but notice this uncanny resemblance to George Costanza.

4) **Han Solo and Princess Leia have a long-running on and off love affair, culminating in the famously ad-libbed line: ""I love you."" ""I know.""** This is a direct mirror to the nearly romantic exchange between Jerry and Elaine as the plane crashes.

5) **The Emperor is killed in the destruction of the Death Star.** Clearly, this is a nod to the death of Jerry's stand-up career, as it is meant to retell his stumbling through a set in front of the other inmates (only to be dragged off the stage by the guards).

Where the two stories begin to deviate is at the point where Buzz begins to develop [Stockholm syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome).

Buzz copes with this by creating alter egos for Andy and the other toys by conjuring up a cruel neighbor and his 'experiments'. Sid mutilates and destroys toys. Sid is actually Andy's dark side Buzz imagines to keep the good Andy 'pure' in his eyes. The grotesque, warped toys represent Andy's toy's tortured souls. However, Woody remains the same to Buzz.

(Hannibal 2013 edition),Ulcerlisk,11,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyFanTheories/comments/1bv03j/everything_laurence_fishburne_stars_in_is_a/,"Hello shittyfantheorists, while watching the premiere to Hannibal, my friend and I concluded it was a prequel to The Matrix. Not only this, but everything Laurence Fishburne stars in may too be a prequel to The Matrix, although we haven't fleshed out the rest of the theory. If people like this, I may do more research, or someone else can go ahead and do so. Here's what we have regarding Hannibal (2013):

Facts:
---
1. Will Graham, the main protagonist, is an eclectic outcast not unlike Neo.
2. Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus) stars in the show as a primary character, but not the main protagonist.
3. In a scene during the premiere episode of Hannibal, one of the victims on the wall is named ""A. Anderson."" Sound familiar, Mr. Anderson?
1. Neo is an anagram of ""One"" as in ""The One.""

---

Throughout the first episode, we see that Morpheus is putting Will Graham through trials and is testing him. Dr. Alana Boom (henceforth known as Trinity) warns Morpheus not to let him get too close, obviously their methods prior to *follow the white rabbit* were not yet perfected. Will Graham also demonstrates superhuman-like powers, which is why Morpheus believes he may be ""The One."" Will Graham also spends most of his time around Agents, although he is not an Agent himself.

A. Anderson (obviously referring to Thomas A. Anderson aka *Neo*) is a name shown on the wall of victims. This and the other names all refer to other people who are potentially The One, it's just that Morpheus and Trinity must seek them out one at a time. Other names are D. Woodward, R. Winn, S. Olsen, L. Sorenson, D. Latimer, P. Cohen, and probably a few more. Something to remember for the next time you watch a film starring Laurence Fishburne.

***Hannibal (2013)*** **is undoubtedly a prequel to** ***The Matrix,*** **and there may yet be more to be discovered with further research into Laurence Fishburne films.** Also, we didn't really like the show.

We have to admits links on Reddit are 99% garbage. Old meme, bad advert, hidden advert, cats, and unfunny cartoon.

BUT, once in a while you find a very funny picture, a really cute dog, a thoughtful analysis, or a moving story.
So you keep on clicking through the craps, every day, forever.

Redditors know they are addicted to the site. They even feed the addiction: Front page title are always misleading with hidden meaning. People upvote only title the more mysterious, so they can be surprised when clicking... And keeping on clicking.

""A 3 pound, 5 month, black and white cat"" is a title you'll never see on front page. You get ""Mister Fluffy is at it again!!!!"".. I click! What could it be? Garbage again? ""OMG! IT'S A FUNNY KITTEN!!!"" .. Upvote

Misleading title come every day ""WORST. THING. EVER"".. What could it be. I should click! ""OMG SOMEONE TAKE TWO PARKING SLOT!!!!"" .. Upvote

We're addicted, and we keep it that way.

**Why**, and more important WHO want us to stay on a silly webpage clicking stupid title after stupid title, ever and ever. 

The obvious reason is given by the small Reddit Logo: Aliens. Aliens built Reddit, so we stay on earth reading Meme instead of conquering the galaxy.

**BUT** That's what IT want you to believe. Even the aliens are a scarecrow. Aliens dont exists, and if they do they wont built a website for us.

But someone really want us distracted. Someone hidden, malevolent almost ready to raise to power.

As you can see, the bikes don't come even close to hitting the glass, and the only thing they do is destroy the awkward shark fin, which also no more than glances the glass. Furthermore, that fin is plastic, no way it could break glass.

I think the glass breaking was planned and staged, to make it LOOK authentic to try and get people to buy insurance. Maybe there is a guy in the back with a hammer, but the glass falls INWARD...

Any ideas on how they did it? I just simply can't believe it would break on it's own in those circumstances.

In the cartoon-stick-figure web series Dick Figures, we often see the main characters, Red and Blue, at heads with one another. Red is always the victor in these various disputes and conflicts, and often drags Blue through some seriously horrendous shit by the end of the episode. These include, but are not limited to, going back in time and killing all the dinosaurs to satisfy Red's hunger, taking him to 'Sal Sagev' and getting them both broke, and wishing a genie to shut up so that he cannot grant Red or Blue 457 wishes. 

Red also seems to be either completely oblivious to the chaos he causes in Blue's life, or is intentionally uncaring, just as long as he gets what he wants. Red also appears to have some insane, almost omnipotent powers. Blue is in eternal suffering as Red basically walks all over him, murdering and causing all kinds of havoc, and almost always gets away with it.

My theory is this: Red represents God, as malicious and unstoppable and omnipotent as he is, and Blue represents Satan, eternally suffering for the choices Red makes, who seems to relish it all.

This can be further supported by various events throughout the episodes; Red silencing a Genie, a spirit of another religion (as said before), Red coming from the stars to save Blue from suffering, though unintentionally, and Red basking and glorifying his ultimately evil actions.

The machine works like a TARDIS and is sent billions, maybe even trillions, of years into the past, to the planet known as Tatoonie. There, Hitler's descendant created a family who after thousands of years, gave birth to Anakin.

The events of all six Star Wars movies are shown as a repeat of a galactic holocaust.

PS. Why do some of the creatures in Star Wars look human, but are called something else? That's because it was changed over thousands of years through breeding with different races, and they are descendants of Hitler, so are, therefore, humans.

The truth is that the prophecy stated that ""either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives""

Their theory is that the prophecy means that Harry can only die at the hands of voldemort and is therefore immortal.

My theory explains a little more. It answers why Harry survived as a baby (the whole love thing is pretty stupid) and why he comes back at the last battle. Voldemort is not the dark lord mentioned in the prophecy.  He tries to kill Harry a few times but always fails in spite of all the odds in his favor. It's because Harry is immortal and he is not the dark lord. Think about it. Powerful wizard, evil, master of the dark arts, thinks of Harry as an equal rival.

Then its the usual: meeting =&gt; overview of ability/world =&gt; face first (and weak) opponent =&gt; meet new people =&gt; repeat.

Are you ready? OK here we go. So you know the Lucifer character, right? And how his PR team tried to emphasize the ""Morning Star"" part of his name but ultimately couldn't shake his childhood ""Satan"" nickname? Well, in the scene when the team was trying to translate his real name, what caught my eye was the suggestion right before ""Morning Star"" when that one guy suggested **""Light-Bearer""**. Lucifer was REALLY quick to dismiss that one, even though it's *so close* to his real name, and he appears guarded for the rest of the scene. 

Here's the part that will blow your mind. Go back earlier in the series, like way back, in the pilot. Actually, it's the *fourth sentence of the entire series*. It's this:

""And God said, **Let there be light: and there was light.**""

Now, those who are completely caught up know that the ""universe"" arc has yet to be resolved. I think we may be quite a ways away from that, but I think that at some point, this will be revisited. People are quick to dismiss us Satanists as ""Harry Potter fans"", but we know this show loves twists. I'll admit that there's maybe a 30% chance I'm wrong, but keep your eye out for more evidence.

There seems to be no real backstory behind the reason he is violent towards women though, right? 

So, with that little intro, here is my theory. 

Patrick Bateman had a wife before he became a businessman. Due to a falling out, they divorced each other and the baby was born out of wedlock. This baby turns out to be Edward Norton's character from Fight Club (henceforth known as Jack). This explains why Tyler Durden states that his generation is ""A generation of men raised by women."" This also explains why Jack leads a double life with Tyler. Much like his Father, Jack hates conforming and living a typical life, and, as a result, gets insomnia and [ultimately creates a personality similar to Patrick Bateman's serial killer personality in the form of Tyler Durden](#spoiler). This also explains why Jack has an anti consumerist side. His mother drilled into him at a young age that the decadence of his father led to his downfall and demise as an investment banker. Unfortunately, Jack is trying to follow the same path by working his way up at an automobile company at the beginning of the movie, but ultimately escapes the materialistic and decadent path his father went by joining with Tyler.

Jesse, a revenge for failing his class. Then Hank kills Jesse, because Hank is frustrated that he doesn't kill Heisenberg. Marie kills Hank because he's bad husband. Gomez kills Marie as a tribute to Hank. Gomez is killed by the chief of police (remember all those times in seasons 2 and 3 Gomie forgot to file reports.)

His plans are thwarted by Ted, who kills him because he paralyzed him (Ted drops subtle hints in season 4 like ""I'm going to kill Saul because he's faggot)


The final scene is Walt jr confronting Ted

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lx8_-kpWdVo

We can clearly see the car incoming after Hank tells him to ""pull a U-ey"" (the true meaning of that is still up for debate, personally I think he is making a mineral reference). Then, the turn Walter makes gives out a loud screech, as he sharply turns, which is unordinary. It seems like Walter knows the car is coming, as he flinches a little (this might just be the actor though).

I believe, that Walter purposely crashed to avoid going into the Landromat. Here is what I am thinking: We know walter works at one, and maybe Hank wanted to check out the same one? If it WAS the same one, it would have been really awkward for Walter, since he might be recognized, even more, Hank might actually find something. By crashing, it bought Walter time to call them and tell them that Hank was on to them, and for them to clean up.

I know he didn't call them after the crash, but he could have done it behind the scenes (which will be revealed next season in a flashback?).
