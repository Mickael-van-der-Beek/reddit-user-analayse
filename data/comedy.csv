the O stuipdly capatalized because who would pay an intern to do
that?? Okay so you bought the thing with my fat face on it and
you clicked the button that said i could email you. And i know
that now you are thinking ""aw shit. Why'd i let this guy into my
life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.

Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.

Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the
thing and opted in. But dont hold me to that because really i
just thought of it and typed it.

Okay well please have a happy rest of the year and more happy
years after that. And please even have been happy in your past.
What?

Thanks again for giving me 5 dollars. I bought 3 cokes with it.

Regards. Sincerely, Actually,

Louis

===========================
People of Earth (minus the ones who don't give a shit about
this): it's been amazing to conduct this experiment with you. The
experiment was: if I put out a brand new standup special at a
drastically low price ($5) and make it as easy as possible to
buy, download and enjoy, free of any restrictions, will everyone
just go and steal it? Will they pay for it? And how much money
can be made by an individual in this manner?

It's been 4 days. A lot of people are asking me how it's going.
I've been hesitant to share the actual figures, because there's
power in exclusive ownership of information. What I didn't expect
when I started this was that people would not only take part in
this experiment, they would be invested in it and it would be
important to them. It's been amazing to see people in large
numbers advocating this idea. So I think it's only fair that you
get to know the results. Also, it's just really cool and fun and
I'm dying to tell everybody. I told my Mom, I told three friends,
and that wasn't nearly enough. So here it is.

First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
I'm actually investing my own money.

The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
$250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
$500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
have owned your private information for their own use. They would
have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
us again.

I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
fat sweaty dolt).

I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
show you wanted.

I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
Industries, who created the website.

I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
again for all this crazy shit.

Please send him some love. ,mcjesse,42,10,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/tyaxp/comedian_wil_sylvince_had_a_emotional_moment_on/,"I went to an awesome show at the Comedy Cellar last night in New york, I went to see Marc Maron, but was pleasantly surprised when Aziz Ansari did a surprise set to try some new material.

Anyway the last comedian was a guy named Wil Sylvince. Funny guy, great energy, some shock humor, like lots of over the top acting out graphic sexual acts ect... which is why what happened next was especially unexpected...  right before the end of his set he seemed kind of distracted and started going into a tangent about how doing comedy has really helped him get through some hard stuff recently. His voice started trembling and he appeared to be really trying hard to hold it together. And all of a sudden we realized this wasn't a setup, he was just having a real emotional moment in front of the crowd. Thats when he told us that his Godson had died a week ago at the age of 19, and that being on stage and doing comedy has really been helping him get through everything he's going through right now. 

Theres just so much energy between a comedian and their crowd to begin with... but I've never seen it turn that direction before. It wasn't so much sad or awkward or anything, like when someones bombing, it was just powerful. I guess he just needed to say something there. The room was completely silent, we didn't know what he was going to do next. Finally he just pulled it together as much as he could, said his last joke, and ended like a champ. 

The reason I'm posting this on reddit is because I felt the need to do something for him. So all I can really say is, check him out. Look him up on youtube, check out his Comedy Central special, if he's not your cup of tea, thats fine, but if you dig it, SHOW HIM SOME LOVE. I feel like he'd really appreciate it right now.

I like movies like Black Dynamite, Rubber, Blazing Saddles, Burn After Reading and Airplane!.

I like TV shows like Superjail, Metalocalypse, WONDER SHOWZEN (Two seasons was not enough!), Harvey Birdman, QI, Regular Show, Adventure Time, Parks and Recreation, NTSFSDSUV, Sportsdome and Workaholics.

What else is out there, in terms of stand-up, movies or shows?

1363538813.0,31,self.comedy,1agxpn,Christopher Titus was in town last night.  Here's how the show went:,Osiris32,39,8,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/1agxpn/christopher_titus_was_in_town_last_night_heres/,"""Fucking epic"" doesn't quite seem to cover how great his set was last night.  It started off with a female comic named ~~Brenda,~~ (*EDIT:  Actually, it's Rachael Bradley, who's Titus' girlfriend, as was pointed out by /u/MasterTre*) who was pretty funny.  I wouldn't call her the next Whoopi Goldberg or Lily Tomlin, but her style of humor fit well with Titus and she did a good job of warming us up.  Stories about a weird upbringing in small-town Texas, coupled with stories about substance abuse and the fun times had dealing with drunk/coked out rednecks while being a pretty girl who was also drunk/coked out.

Then the man came on.  Literally carrying notes.  ""I've got some new material here that I've been working very hard on.  Obviously, however, I have not been working hard on memorizing it.""  Just like the rest of his comedy, it was about some dark and scary places in the human psyche, along with his pretty fucked-up life and the things that he observes.  Jokes about arming students instead of teachers, having a surprise Lion Day to ""thin the herds and tune us good ones up,"" and a couple of jokes based on being here in Portland over St Patrick's Day Weekend.

That was the first half of his set, which went over the 90 minutes it was supposed to.  The last half was a mix of jokes from Love is Evol, Norman Rockwell is Bleeding, and The Voice in My Head.  Inner Retard jokes (which he took in a whole different direction, ranting about how the word ""retard"" should no longer refer to those with mental or physical handicaps, but actual retards who have all their faculties but are just fucking stupid, along with an AMAZINGLY funny story about a comic friend of his with MS who fucked with a waitress who treated him like he was a lesser person) stories about his dad, a great story about nearly killing himself in a Dodge Viper, stuff from his USO tours, and a couple jokes about his ex-wife.

Oh, and a heckler.  Well, not really a heckler, just a drunk woman who thought she should sit down CENTER FRONT DURING THE SHOW and loudly proclaim how much she loved him.  Mid-joke.  It was a thing of beauty, because he stopped, stared at this woman, then looked up at the crowd with ""Aww yeah, this gonn' be gud"" all over his face.  He then proceeded to calmly ridicule this woman back to her actual table in such a devastating fashion it belies retelling.  Never, in all my years of going to stand up comedy shows or working as a stage hand for national acts, have I seen someone handle a show interruption with such off-the-cuff, machine gun-like responses and comments.  He battered into her like Grond at the gates of Minas Tirith, and she lasted about as long as the doors did in the movie.

Which brings me to my last point.  The dude is not just funny, but a class act.  He had a little booth set up at the top of the stairs where people could buy his DVDs and meet him and Brenda.  And every person he met he looked in the eye, shook their hand, listened to what they had to say, smiled, posed for photos, and not once did he look like he wasn't enjoying it.  ESPECIALLY when the drunk woman came up, he ran around the table and gave her a big hug, apologized if she had felt uncomfortable, and then thanked her because it made the night unique for him (and could possibly provide new material for his next show).  I was second-to-last in line, and his smile and warm attitude was just as present as it was for the first guy in line.

Yeah, it was worth the $30 (fucking service charge) to see him.  WELL worth it.  Look him up, if he's coming to your town, GO SEE HIM.  Your face and sides will hate you, but your brain will thank you.",,False,,t5_2qhkm,1363624595.0,,,True,t3_1agxpn,http://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/1agxpn/christopher_titus_was_in_town_last_night_heres/,

Whilst in Providence RI i got talking to a Canadian who mentioned that he loved a british comedy called 'Saxondale' (A sit-com staring Steve Coogan based on a former 'roadie to the stars' turned pest controller).

This came as a shock to me as this program did not do very well over here and upon telling this story to my friends they remarked they had not even heard of the show. 

Although i personally think that the show is far weaker than what i regard to be his best work 'I'm Alan Partridge', i was intrigued by his appetite for British comedy and have often wondered if i had met him again what other shows i would suggest he try.

As i am neither likely nor bothered enough to try to meet him again, here, for you, is that list.


1. Im Alan Partridge

Steve Coogan plays a failed TV turned radio host (Alan Partridge) who, following the cancellation of his tv show and divorce from his wife, is reduced to living in a travel tavern and working 'the graveyard shift' at a local radio station.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_IoPAd_Yw0


2. Peep Show

Peep Show follows the lives of two men (Mark and Jez) from their twenties to thirties who share a flat in South London. Mark is financially secure, but awkward and socially inept, with a pessimistic and cynical attitude. Jeremy, having split up with his girlfriend now lives in Mark's spare room. He usually has a much more optimistic and energetic outlook on the world than Mark, yet his self-proclaimed talent as a musician has yet to be recognized, and he is not as popular or attractive as he would like to think himself, although he is more successful with the opposite sex than Mark.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCC5lYl6bxg


3. Phoenix Nights

Starring Pete Kay 'phoenix nights' is based on a group of people who work at a small community club in north England.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xkRSuAPDdw


4. Father Ted

Father Ted is based on two vicars living on a small remote island off Ireland (not technically a British show but was shown on British TV).

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L6K6SM5sq0


5. Big Train

Starring Simon Pegg and following in the tradition of Monty Python, the comedy of Big Train is based on the subversion of ordinary situations by the surreal or macabre.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JQ8fun0jUA


6. The Fast Show

A Sketch show that aired in the US as 'Brilliant'.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6FXb3GKDHs


7. League of Gentlemen

The League of Gentlemen follows the lives of dozens of a small town's bizarre inhabitants, played mainly by 3 actors in a number of different guises and make-up.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGntH-aOlWU

8. Trigger Happy TV

Trigger Happy TV is a hidden camera/practical joke reality television series.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyeiMYDRbsI


9. Phonejacker

A telephone based prank show

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmJvujHG5DM



I hope you will find as much humor from any one of these shows as they have brought me.

I would in turn be grateful of any comical hidden gem your country may have produced that didn't get the worldwide recognition you feel it deserved.

While I was fairly confident I'd get a chuckle or two out of my silly family stories, he was nervous as all get-out...it was his first time too, and he's only 19.

I went to get a drink at the bar, and as I did I noticed a familiar-looking portly guy with a distinctive moustache sitting at a table in the back with a few people. I did a double take, and sure enough, it was Zach Galifinakis, who's been in town filming a movie with Will Ferrell. I freaked out....Zach is one of my fave comedians, and, well, a bona-fide superstar. 

I ran over to my friend, excitedly tapping him on the shoulder....""GUESS WHO'S HERE?"" I nervously whispered. The answer did not help with his anxiety. 

Anyway, my friend was the fourth comic to go up, and he did pretty well...got a few laughs out of a drug story. I was due to go sixth, so I was going through my material in my head, figuring the next guy had about 3 minutes before I got my chance. All of a sudden, the host announced ""And now, ladies and gentleman, the host of 'Between Two Ferns', one of my favorites, Zach Galifinakis!!!!"" 

My face lit up...I could barely contain my excitement. My friend, on the other hand, though himself thrilled to see Zach, nearly vomited all over the floor from anxiety. Halfway into his act, Zach referenced my friend's drug story, and used it as a segway into his very own tale about being on mushrooms. 

I went on stage a while later and made a shitty joke about how I was disappointed that I didn't get to follow Zach (which I thought I would, but I got bumped down the list as a result) because I wanted to feel like the first guy after Jesus to get crucified. It went over all right. 

My buddy turned out fine. He didn't vom, and got a compliment from a pretty girl who liked his act. We're really pumped about doing more open-mics in the future :)

Anyway, redditors, how 'bout a hand for my friend opening for Zach Galifinakis? ",,False,,t5_2qhkm,False,,,True,t3_ofbf8,http://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/ofbf8/hey_no_pressure_kid/,

So I was in my college improv troupe for a couple years, this happened during the first show of my last year.

We were doing some long-form transition stuff, where the scene follows one character as he/she leaves the scene. One scene started with an underage college student trying to buy beer from a liquor store, the manager was giving him a hard time. I walk in as Jesus (I had long hair and a beard at the time) and convince the owner to sell the alcohol to the kid. So we get the beer and start drinking it. Fast forward a few scenes. The Public Safety officers of the school have been called to the kid's party. They're questioning the kid and other partiers, I (as Jesus) am on the floor wretching my guts out. Basically, it was kind of bedlam as everyone's kind of yelling and carrying on. Then, there's this lull in the noise, a brief moment of silence. So I say, ""My dad's gonna kill me."" BOOM. Laughter, applause so loud that we end the show. Jawsome.

Most of you probably don't have much interaction with me, and I feel like some of you are probably okay with that. Largely my role has pretty much been: pull legit posts from the spam filter and have pretty flair. My philosophy has been to stay hands off and let the subreddit thrive on its own. 

I've added a new moderator today, /u/silentisdeath . He's pretty motivated about this subreddit, and I certainly hope he'll help me make this subreddit into something you all enjoy and come to first for your comedy needs.

Obviously there's some merit to this sub, we're a 6000 member community and it happened somewhat silently. But now that we're somewhat large, I think there's probably some improvements that you guys are seeking and I'd like to provide them. In particular I've received complaints about users posting their own stand-up routines and asking for advice. I responded with the note on the sidebar, but I feel we might be better served by having a more regular weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly Open Mic thread. 

If you guys have any ideas for improvement, please let us know. Let's talk about it. Or joke about it. Or just say ""fuck it"" and keep going.",,False,,t5_2qhkm,False,,standard,True,t3_15hxnh,http://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/15hxnh/moderator_here_how_can_we_improve_this_subreddit/,moderator

I just think it would be fun to chat about our aspirations for this career we are choosing. Also, itd be cool to see how everyone has decided to pursue this, who their inspirations are and how they are going about pursuing comedy.

So hey, for me, I am 21 years old, currently performing in an improv/sketch group in my hometown and I am moving down to Austin next year to immerse myself in their comedy scene. I look at it as a middle of the road type comedy scene, where it is more supportive than a place with industry and less cutthroat. I'm hoping to just get support and constructive criticism so I can actually see if this is what I really want to do. As in terms of where I want my career to go, the skys the limit. Ideally I would love to do TV and movies, but if in 20 years I find myself in a small art centered town in lets say Washington state I won't mind, as long as I am involved in creative things.

Inspirations for me are hard. I don't really look back and see one person or work that made me be like, ""thats it, that is what I want to do."" I was always interested in acting and writing as a kid, so I kind of just grew up wanting to do something involved with it and after high school I finally decided that heck yeah, I will pursue comedy. But with that said, I am currently in love with Kids in the Hall, Mr. Show, Seinfeld (starting with season one and going up) and Louie. There are many other things, but I feel like that can be discussed later.  But woo! Lets have some fun and talk comedy together!

* Watch Jay Leno's monologue
* Pause before punchline
* Write your own punchline
* Compare with actual punchline.

It seemed like a good idea for a beginner like me, so I decided to go with it.  To give myself more practice I added the rule: 

* Add two ""toppers"" to every punchline you write.

**(SETUP)** Well, listen: How is this for equality?  Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced today that women in all branches of the military will have the opportunity to serve on the front lines of battle.

**(PUNCHLINE)** In a related story, Hooter's has announced they signed a contract with the pentagon to open mobile sandwich shops in Afghanistan and Iraq.

**(TOPPER1)** Feminist groups were outraged until the defense department backed down and agreed that female soldiers would not be required to wear burqas while serving in the mobile Hooter's.

**(TOPPER2)** The effects this will have on US' mid-east war efforts are unknown, but there are already reports that Taliban officials are prepared to offer terms for a cease-fire agreement.  Equal access to the new mobile Hooter's appear to be non-negotiable elements in these terms.

**(LENOSPUNCHLINE)** Panetta said he had no idea women could be such ferocious fighters until he saw a couple of episodes of Real Housewives of Atlanta and he realized... Hoo!

Rob Hu
Arthur Simeon
Ari Shaffir
Amy Schumer
Pete Holmes (absolutely killed)
W Kamau Bell
Todd Barry
James Adomian
Louis CK
Todd Glass 
Neal Brennan
Trevor Wilson

Each comedian was great. Honest to god (that I don't believe in) no one had a bad set. The crowds were astonishingly good. ZERO hecklers at any show (maybe it's because it's Canada). 

This festival was a massive success and will certainly grow next year. If you have the means I suggest you come to Toronto for the week next year and take it all in. 

I was lucky enough to meet a lot of these comedians at a party last night and they're just as funny as you think they'd be in person. Todd Glass was making a group of 6 or 7 of us laugh uncontrollably. 

Anyways that's my rant and I'll leave you with this. Look for Louis CK doing an ""of course...but maybe..."" bit that will make you fucking laugh your stupid asses off.

He was on Conan a few weeks ago promoting it. Now I loved Portal 2, and I thought his voice acting was hilarious. I've always been an Office fan (both US and UK) and I think he's a hilarious guy. So I wanted to help support his stand up and buy the DVD.

I searched Amazon.com for it, and found nothing. So then I did a google search, and sure enough, it was on Amazon.co.uk. So I decided I'll go ahead and order it from there. It ships Royal mail. Three weeks go buy and I still haven't received it. I start to worry. I wait another week, still nothing. Finally I contact Amazon and they apologize and ship me a new one. Again, it takes two weeks to finally arrive. This time, I did actually receive it. I pop it into my PS3, getting ready to watch it on my nice TV and surround sound system. Turns out, PS3 doesn't media in the PAL format. So instead I have to RIP the DVD to my HD, play it on my PS3 over my media server, just to get it onto my TV. Instead of going through that hassle, I ended up just watching it on my PC using VLC.

Seriously...this is why pirating exists. We need easier access. I encourage everyone to continue to support Louis CK and Jim Gaffigan.

EDIT 1:
It's like Gabe says, it's a service problem, not a pricing issue: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/114391-Valves-Gabe-Newell-Says-Piracy-Is-a-Service-Problem

Looking for any video clips of a comedian circa late 80s/90s. Used to see him on Stand-up Stand-up, but I think his act pre-dated the show.

White guy, kinda heavyset, had a mustache. He did Blue Collar Comedy-type material, specifically regarding ""southern style"" speaking, and he used home-made cue cards (black with white letters). Went something like this...

""People in the south talk funny, like after eating dinner they'll say...

**CARD:** ""Jav nuff teet?"" 

**CARD:** ""Jawant summor?""

Oh, more pataters, okay...

**CARD:** ""Eer yar.""

Let me know if any of this rings a bell. Thanks!

I was very nervous, but it went pretty well. It was a big deal to me, and I posted the video to Facebook and Youtube for my friends and family to see. Everyone was really nice, for the most part. 

One of the responses was from a guy who bullied me in high school. He was a real dick then, and apparently things haven't changed. His bullying in high school is one of the things that made me funny - I guess you'd call it a defense mechanism.

Now, what he said to me didn't really offend me. I'm a big boy, I can take it. My performance wasn't as good as I wanted it to be. But this cowardly cocksucker has never done stand-up before, and he has zero  right to criticize me IMO. It's not really his words, it's the principle of the matter.

This guy is a complete loser, and an absolute gold mine of material if I decided to go after him.

My question is this - Is it a breach of comedic etiquette to destroy a heckler like this? Assuming I could make it funny (and I can), would it be appropriate? Or would I just look pathetic?

The guy means nothing to me, and I could just as easily not ever mention it and never think of him again. Or I could destroy him, and be able to write a full set of really funny stuff with pretty much no effort.

TL;DR - Is it a breach of comedic etiquette to destroy a Facebook heckler?",,False,,t5_2qhkm,False,,,True,t3_17nnok,http://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/17nnok/etiquette_for_dealing_with_hecklers/,

For research purposes I'm looking for the name of a comedian in the 30s/40s/50s/60s who used to do a rather terrible act which consisted of him ending sentences with an odd noise. So the story he would be telling would go like this: ""I took my wife to the *PRRRRrrrrt* and then she wanted me to buy her an *TSCCHhhuuuUU* with some of my *BOOOiing* etc. etc."" This is all I know about the act.

I'm pretty sure his name got mentioned on an episode of Opie and Anthony but damned if I'm able to find it online. Any true comedy geeks out there who would like to venture a guess? You'd be really helping me out of a *TTRRrriiiIIIIInnng*.

I've heard lots of stories about comedy nerds memorizing other people's acts because they love them so much. But could you also reperform them? Not as your own material. Obviously, you would say, oh all of this material is just so and so's gig, I'm just presenting it here for you.

And then, maybe when you get more experienced, you could start melding in your own jokes and tags into the act since audience reaction wouldn't be the exact same as the DVD/mp3.",,False,,t5_2qhkm,False,,,True,t3_es83i,http://www.reddit.com/r/comedy/comments/es83i/is_there_such_a_thing_as_a_cover_comedian/,

I would appreciate your recommendations on other funny and smart stand-up comedians along those lines. I am sure there are many more that are just as good. 

Also, on a related note, are there any good conservative comedians?  I have not really seen any good comedian, or what I consider to be a good comedian, who would be of conservative views.

Tomorrow I have an interview for my dream job in the world of comedy. It's to be part of the comedy programming team for a very popular theatre in London.

Now I know quite a bit about comedy, and some up and coming comedians (I wouldn't have applied if I didn't enjoy the field...) - but I thought I would throw this out to you /r/comedy people.

Can you tell me any up-and-coming comedians either in the UK, or abroad that would be good names to drop, as I know that one of the questions I'll be asked will be is there any one out there that I think should be given a chance..?

Or if there is any other words of encouragement you can give me it would be greatly appreciated, as I am shitting myself about this...

THANKS!
