1358577809.0,124,self.fringe,16v6de,Thank you r/Fringe!  A message to the community.  ,nitesmoke,135,11,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/16v6de/thank_you_rfringe_a_message_to_the_community/,"Tonight, one of (in my opinion) best science fiction shows of all time had its final chapter.  Fringe perfectly encapsulated what ""science fiction"" is supposed to be.  When the majority of ""scifi"" we find in television and movies today treat the genre as an afterthought, Fringe was a breath of fresh air and a return to what scifi's thematic roots.  Today, ""science fiction"" is a term used to describe any type of entertainment that takes place in the future, involves advanced technology, or involves space ships.  You could literally take the entire cast and plots from The Young and the Restless and change the setting from middle America to a space station orbiting an asteroid and you would have what most people today consider ""scifi.""  
It truly began when Star Trek decided to ask the tough questions about society and how humanity could better itself through technology, progress, and optimism.  Remember, when Star Trek debuted, scifi was Lost in Space, campy space fantasy.  Trek asked us what it meant to be human.  It made us question prejudices and explore not so much the final frontier, but ourselves.  Fringe is, I believe, one of the few shows that honors this powerful legacy.  It continues the theme of asking us who we are and ""what if.""  How far would you go to save your son?  Would you risk destroying the world?  When do we let science thrive and when do we place ethical limits on it?  How can our actions today affect another time or place?  And what makes us who we are, our DNA, or our experiences?  How far would you go to stop yourself from becoming the thing you hate? These questions and more were asked on Fringe, and they never held back or pulled punches dealing with tough subject material and make us ask ourselves these questions.  
When I saw the pilot episode, I knew the show was going to be good, but I didn't have any clue of what it would become.  At the time, I was looking for a replacement for Lost, and Fringe seemed like a logical choice.  The first few episodes were great, but the show still needed room to grow.  After season two, it was my favorite show in years, surpassing Lost.  Where Lost focused on the mystery, and keeping the answers on a perpetual carrot-on-a-stick,   Fringe wasn't afraid to give us answers, even if they weren't what they seemed at first.  
The characters on Fringe are special.  Olivia was so great.  She oozed professionalism and curiosity.  She was intelligent and determined.  Astrid, who began as an afterthought, didn't take long to become one of the best sidekicks in recent memory.  Peter was brilliant and the driving motivation for my favorite character:  Walter.  Walter Bishop, is the best television character in a decade.  I put him up against any other notable character.  He was consistently entertaining and a genuine pleasure to watch grow and develop as a person.  He is, by far, the best example of a ""mad scientist"" on television.  
When I started /r/Fringe I had no idea what it would turn into.  In the early days, I would log into reddit to see we had gone from 50 subscribers to 65 and be so excited.   Seeing us at over 10,000 now is still unbelievable.  With all of you here, it is still the friendliest subreddit I moderate, even counting /r/fantasy.  In 4 years I've only banned 5 accounts, most of which were just novelty accounts.  The discussions have been awesome, and I've loved speculating and debating all of you.  You guys have been the source of so much great reading and discussions, I would like to personally thank all of you for being a part of this with me.  
To my other mods, I also thank.  The subreddit would not have been nearly as great without you guys keeping the spam out and helping drive discussion.  None of you were paid and volunteered your own personal time to make this a better community.  
This is not goodbye!  We're not going anywhere.  We will be here to discuss whatever you want about Fringe.  We will continue to have discussions and share our ideas, art, and favorite Fringe moments here, so please stay subscribed.  Thanks again to all of you, this have been a great ride.  Thanks to the cast and crew of Fringe for making such a great show for us to enjoy these past few years.  
Stay Observant, my friends.

I love Fringe, and I love Community, and they're both critically acclaimed but low-rating shows with dedicated fanbases. It was suggested on [the Community reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/community/comments/mexgd/ideas_to_save_community_align_with_another_show/) that the fans do a bit of a TV Show exchange and try to build momentum by introducing new viewers to a show they might not have seen before.

If you haven't seen Community, it's basically this generation's arrested development. Single camera comedy, meta-jokes, genre-inverting episodes, parodies, pop culture, snark, wit. It also could be the great show you missed out on when it was on the air but will discover in six years on DVD and wish you'd been there to help it when it was out. Watch it on [NBC.com](http://www.nbc.com/community) so that they can track its viewership.

Likewise, the Community community will be tuning into Fringe to help it out. We have to stick together through this, and hopefully at least one, if not both, can make it another season. :)

EDIT: The show's airing on the east coast now and west coast in three hours (Thurs 8pm). Tweet #savecommunity if you can.",,False,,t5_2qii0,True,,,True,t3_mf9un,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/mf9un/we_ratingschallenged_shows_need_to_stick_together/,

Walter tells us a palimpsest is *""a manuscript page from a scroll or book from which the text has been scraped off which means it can be used again""* and then mentions how the former contents of these manuscripts can bleed through. It's the same language that has been used in describing how Peter emerged in this timeline. 

It seems like they are telling us Peter's return is equivalent to what happens with a palimpsest--or in other words, there is no timeline for him to return to. Traces of it may bleed though, but the timeline he is in is the same timeline from season's 1-3 but it has been overwritten. Which would suggest it can no longer be accessed--he cannot return to it.

This is a troubling revelation since we also learned that Peter had to be removed from the timeline to erase his son, Henry, from existence because that child was supposed to exist in the other universe and be born to the other Olivia. This serves to reinforce to Peter that he needs to return to his timeline, but if there is no timeline to return to and Amberlivia and Ourlivia are one-in-the-same... well that misunderstanding might just destroy the universe.

Also, I'm getting the vibe that September (and perhaps all the Observers) is a distant blood relative of the Bishops and that is why Henry needs to be born.",,False,,t5_2qii0,False,,,True,t3_q7is8,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/q7is8/season_4_is_a_palimpsest_spoilers/,

Tonight we got to White Tulip.  SO MUCH of this episode is relevant to The End of All Things - particularly how time travel works.  Every time Peck goes back in time, he is NOT creating alternate realities from it - he is overwriting.  The episode makes that very clear.

I posit that the Observers' time travel tech must work similarly. A) Whenever Peck goes back, he replaces himself - there is no copy of him there to meet.  Which means that he can't cross into his own timeline without changing things. B) Peck (and Walter) specifically say that when they change the past, the 'new' future replaces the 'old' one.  At the end of the episode, nobody on the train has died, the Fringe team isn't investigating a case anymore, and nobody has any memory of Peck being anything more than someone who died in a car accident with his fiancee. (Though why nobody noticed he's now a cyborg I donno).

C) In one of the timeline revisions, the 'second' one that we see, Olivia has deja vu when looking at Peck's MIT diploma in astrophysics. Peter says something along the lines of ""Deja vu is fate's way of telling you you are where you should be.""

Thoughts? I'm thinking Peter is exactly 'where' he needs to be - he's in the wrong 'when.' He IS home, just someone did a lot of redecorating.",,False,,t5_2qii0,False,,,True,t3_q6l78,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/q6l78/go_watch_white_tulip_again_right_now/,

I wanted to share a thought which in my case, I didn't really realise until someone told it. 

Michael tells Olivia twice to be silent, he puts his finger on his mouth.
At first I didn't really understand, but here is the thing:

She will be the only one to remember the events that happend in season 5. Just like when she got the memories of a life with Peter which she didn't have. 
But ofcourse she may not tell this so anyone.

 

You can see it, beautiful acting by our Anna, in her face at the ending: kinda like a smile of relief and a look of someone who knows more.

Credits to Baelorn:
In the scene at the park, when Etta is running towards Peter, Olivia isn't looking at them. She looks out over the hill expectantly and then, when no Observers show up, she looks at them and smiles.

Thanks for reading and have a nice one.


Edit: I understand that the times when he shushed her were times if she kept talking she would have interfered with the way Michael intended things to go. 

But I think the time Michael shushed Olivia after she used her cortexiphan powers ment a bit more, because this showed she still had these powers, meaning these might give her the memories back too.

1363498125.0,87,self.fringe,1ag9kd,"Just completed Fringe, and I loved every minute of it.",iammas,96,9,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/1ag9kd/just_completed_fringe_and_i_loved_every_minute_of/,"I know these sorts of topics probably come up a little too much in this part of reddit but I felt like I needed to at least broad cast how I feel about this series.

I'd always seen people talk about fringe on forums and always say great things about this series. Although the show looked good to me I thought it was just another one of those CSI type shows so I never really checked it out. A few weeks after the Season 5 finale my friend wouldn't stop talking about the show and kept telling me to watch it he even challenged me to not cry when I got to the end of the show. I honestly didn't believe that a show which looked quite average to me could bring tears out of anyone at all. I had just finished catching up on Adventure time and re-watching Dragon Ball Z so I thought why the hell not watch at least the first season.

So I spent my weekends watching the first season of fringe. At first I thought the show was okay as it was pretty much what I had thought it would be. It was a CSI type show, although it had much more of a storyline than most crime solving shows, and to my surprise it had lots of Science Fictional elements and that is what made me stick around. Fringe was a smart show which got me to think after every episode and by episode 10 of Season 1 I was in love. After this I continued to spend my weekends watching fringe with sometimes even loading up a few episodes on weekdays, something which I don't usually do. And after all this time watching Fringe I finally finished Season 5 last night and as you all know it was excellent. And yes I lost my friends challenge, I cried many man tears.

The only shows before fringe that have ever gotten me to invest so much love into the characters has been Supernatural, Scrubs, Chuck and Firefly so I am so happy that I took the time to watch this excellent series. Although the show is over my love for it isn't. I plan on buying any bit of material which expands on the series whether it be Comic Books or Novels. I am just so happy I was able to experience a show like fringe in my lifetime.

I know this topic was rather pointless but I just needed to express my feelings on the show and I thought this was the best place to do it. 

I just love Fringe!

I had to point it out here.

Remember throughout season 1, ZFT was a book written about the coming war with unknown beings that are like us but slightly different from the future that could travel between universes?  After watching last night's episode, I realized the book was never referring to the Other Side, but to the Observers themselves.  I always wondered this since in the end of the season 2 episode ""Fracture"", the ex-military terrorist dude pointed out that the Observers have been planning for ""war"".

It's a stretch too, but I believe the Pattern may have been conducted by the Observers, now that I think  about it.  Since they are observing our culture and our technology, they may be passing theirs onto us to see how we would perform using them.  An experiment, per se, only the whole world is a lab.  Thus why the Observers appear during every major event, because they wanted the course of events to happen in a very specific way, and they were there to make sure it happens, but they may have instigated it somehow.

The end of the Fringe saga is quickly approaching!

With about a month left until the season premier, traffic on this subreddit is going to start steadily increasing. New and old fans alike are going to gather here to discuss theories, surprises, revelations and resolutions. With this being the last season, one can imagine that number of posts here will be extremely high.

Putting that into consideration, I humbly suggest that the /r/fringe subreddit could greatly benifit from a little bit of upgrade.

It can be something as simple, as adding flair, to complex, like a design overhaul. 

But I do think we could use a little something. I know that I, for one, plan to be here dishing out my own slew of thoughts and theories as the show concludes (and I already have a boatload).

As an example, albiet an extreme one, I say check out /r/gameofthrones . While the presentation and composition of the subject matter is different, they do utilize some qualitative elements which enhance the overall navagation and functionality of the subreddit.

For example:
Different ""types"" of spoiler tags - 
While their subreddit uses them to differentiate between book/tv/speculation spoilers, a similar approach can be utilized here:

Episode Spoilers - applying to all new episodes, teasers, interviews, et al. 

Theory Spoliers - applying to all theories and speculation of what is to come.

Just a small example of maybe adding a little zap to the subreddit in honor of the conclusion of one of the best science fiction shows to be made.

What do you guys (and the mods!) think about it?

This idea was exploited by Walter in the end of the third season when he sent the machine back 250 million years so that it would exist in both universes.

Suppose there is a timeline where there was only a Blueverse. In it Walter, Bell, Olivia, Peter, Broyles, and whoever else all existed. The Pattern never occurred; so there wasn't a Fringe Division. Peter might have lived or died as a child; it doesn't really matter. Walter never broke the universe; he and Bell went on to do all sorts of cool things at Massive Dynamic.

Six hundred years later, the people living on the planet invent time travel and decide to invade 2015 to escape their ultimate demise. This action creates the first time loop. Walter and Bell with help from others come up with a plan to rebel against the invasion. The plan at this point, is not very important. However, one part of the plan is: it involves creating a parallel universe.

So Walter goes about his task and creates the Redverse at some point in early history. The Observers/Invaders, who experience time differently, send a team back to learn as much as they can about the new time line. They have a second objective: to keep events occurring in a way that benefits them. Unfortunately, the Walter of the Blueverse becomes aware of this second universe and thus does all the things we have seen since Fringe started.

The Observers may not even be aware of who created the Redverse and what its purpose is. They know it exists, and they are watching all the important people to gather intelligence. Time travel offers this luxury. You can take all the time you need to learn about history, because you can send the information forward in time to the decision makers, who make adjustments. More time loops are created in the process, but it is also possible to eliminate them by altering the environment prior to each loop's creation. This is where the real war is being fought, even if half the people involved are unaware of it.

As for the original plan that created the Redverse, it may still be in effect unbeknownst to all the characters. Maybe the purpose of the Redverse was to create an alternate timeline where Invaders would never exist, or create a timeline where normal humans have more advanced technology and damage the planet less (we know they use Blimps instead of planes, and coffee isn't available - perhaps due to alternative agricultural practices).

1335077994.0,72,self.fringe,smdsp,Last night's episode made September actually make sense. What a CLEVER way to make his story arc awesome! [SPOILERS!],alexisaacs,84,12,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/smdsp/last_nights_episode_made_september_actually_make/,"So it's clear now that hundreds of thousands of Observers have been existing throughout time to make sure events happen a certain way, most likely to ensure that in 2015, they can successfully over take the world.

September was the Observer initially tasked with the arbitrary mission of making sure Walternate does not see the that he found the cure to save Peter in Redverse. Just another typical task a common Observer would do.

This triggers a series of events wherein Walter goes into Redverse, steals Peter, and then falls through the ice with the boy, thus ensuring that no Peter from either universe would impede the Observer plans in 2015, or what have you. 

September, however, is racked with guilt. He saves Walter &amp; Peter, which upsets the other Observers. He is punished, and is tasked (with a few team members) to restore the time line and eliminate Peter. September reluctantly agrees, and they succeed in influencing the universe to ensure Peter's demise.

Except Peter return to the world, and when September realizes this, he directly disobeys orders and decides to abandon the Observers' missions entirely. At some point he is shot, then returns to the past to explain things to Peter. He realizes that the only way to stop the invasion is to make sure Peter and Olivia have the ""right"" child, so he tells Peter information that allows for this to happen.

Then, he dies. I guess it's too late for the other Observers to change anything so they continue onwards, hoping things work out their way.

**Except for one huge plot hole.** If the Observers exist outside of space-time, and know all past, present and future, how are they not omniscient? Why didn't they simply kill September, go back in time, and have another agent do September's job properly?

How did the Observer in tonight's episode get killed by the anti-matter bomb? Via the show's own premise, he should have known what would happen. Perhaps they can't see their own fates, but surely that Observer could see the fate of the humans in the same room as him?

It seemed weird to us when the episode first aired that the Observers were depicted as malevolent creatures when all we'd seen of them up to that point was the emotionless Science Team type like September.

So re-watching the scene where Peter and Olivia get attacked by the Observers, and with the hindsight of ""Letters of Transit"", we noticed that these Observers were like the ones that came back from the future to 2015--slower, less skilled, not emotionless, and aggressive.  And then at the end of the episode, September calls his buddies and tells them that Walter let the boy go, despite his warning to him.

Anyway, here's the crazy theory that crossed my mind, and it may explain why we're seeing two different types of Observers.  What if September is from the far-removed future of the Earth where the Observers came back to 2015 and took over?  In this timeline, there was never any Henrietta Bishop/Dunham because Peter was cured on the red-universe side and never traveled to our universe to meet our Olivia.  So the Observers came from the future and took over in 2015 and ruled...forever or something.  This is the future I thought September might be from.  The Observers from 2036 didn't have any superhuman abilities and we didn't see any crazy technology, so where did September and his team get theirs?  I'm guessing that they're from the future of an earth that was invaded by men from the future.

So maybe the Science team went back and is just genuinely curious about the past or need to know how something happened so that they can do it too.  I'm not really sure what their real purpose is.  

But anyway, September went and made a mistake.  He distracted Walternate from his work finding a cure for Peter.  Shouldn't have been too terribly large of a deal, but as soon as he realized that Walternate had seen him and been distracted by him...he saw a new possible future.  Somehow distracting Walternate from finding the cure changed the course of the human race in some incredible fashion.  

I think September saw a future where the invading force from the future had been conquered in 2036-2037 or so.  September may have even seen himself--a smiling, happy version of himself, in love with a woman (he seemed to understand the concept between Peter and Olivia, and I think he maybe saw himself in love with someone and wanted that desperately).  And he saw that the world was capable of being a far, far better place than the world that he found himself coming from.

So, every single thing that September has done from that point on has been to ensure that Peter had the baby with the blue-universe Olivia--the baby that would grow up to be the woman instrumental in defeating the Observers in 2036-2037.

1.  He pulled Walter and Peter out of the frozen Reiden Lake
2.  He told Walter that he had to raise Peter
3.  He didn't erase Peter from the new timeline that would have kept Henrietta from being born.
4.  He told Peter that Olivia was his Olivia, and now she's pregnant.

Every interaction he has had since that moment has been in the efforts of preserving that timeline where he saw the better future than the history he knew.

Thoughts?  I'm about to crash, so I'll clarify more in the morning if people throw too many darts at it.

BTW, if this is true, my favorite last scene would be seeing a haired September enjoying time in a park with his wife and kids, smiling.

EDIT:  Thanks for all the replies.  After posting this last night, I sat and thought about it some more, and it dawned on me that this origin theory for September could totally explain why he and his crew have no emotions.  So, September comes from the very original timeline--the one where blue Peter died and red Peter lived, but stayed on the other side.  The invaders from the future come to 2015 and rule with an iron fist for centuries.  Sometime around this 2600 timeframe, September arrives on the scene.  Human history for the last 600 years was one of oppression, where having stray thoughts against the Observers could get you killed.  Feelings are dangerous, free thought is pretty much illegal.  So humans adapted to essentially not have emotions, and that's where September's from--a future where emotions are fully evolved out of the human race because emotions became a liability to the species.

EDIT2:  Upon further reflection, this also explains why there were no invaders from the future in the 2026 episode ""The Day We Died"".  The universe didn't survive for long enough for humanity to send its soldiers back in time and invade in 2015.  This is reflected in my diagram posted in another thread.

**TL;DR: September and the Science Team are from the future of the earth where the 2015 invasion happened and Etta Bishop didn't exist, which is why they are more advanced than the 2036 Observers we see in LoT.  September saw a better future after he interrupted Walternate and has done everything he can to make that future a reality--by making sure Etta was born.**",,False,,t5_2qii0,1337191968.0,,,True,t3_tpc6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/tpc6n/theory_on_why_the_two_different_types_of/,

* Goes to Olivia in the abandoned theater.^(*4x08: Back to Where You've Never Been*)

* Appears in Walter's Lab, so that Peter goes into his mind^(*4x14: The End of All Things*)

* *Gets locked out of universe by other Observers.*^(*Somewhere between 4x14-15*)

* Peter helps bring September back with **The Beacon**^(*4x15: A Short Story About Love*)

When you sit on santas knee you get read. They are compiling a comprehensive database of every human even from the earliest age, ready for the incoming invasion.

In return for the precious information, you are provided with one or more gifts. Just like a lab rat getting a reward.

Observer teleportation powers is how he delivers presents. No chimney, no problem.

You must realize thatI actually loved the first 3 seasons but after that I felt that it fell to pieces. There are numerous things on my mind that I won't get to but I will mention some things. Some of them might be easily explained, some not, so bare with me. 

First of all, the end of season 3 felt like they wrote themselves into a massive corner. They built a great background to the characters and the intrigue for the bigger picture was great but in having Peter be erased from the time line they rehashed old characters, plots and had to reestablish 3 seasons worth of character development just do it again and cram it all into 1 season. Season 5 felt so disjointed from the rest of the story it wasn't the show that I fell in love with. I just didn't care at all about the observers and nor did I care about Peter and Olivia's relationship with Etta. 

What really got to me were thing like:

Things like why Olivia only used her ""powers"" when it was convenient not when it was logical? 

Why didn't she just go to the room the boy observer was and just jump there instead of having to battle to get to him? 

Why did the observers leave Fauxlivias universe alone? What made Olivia's universe so special? Was it just that specific time line they existed in? 

I've mentioned this before but how did Peter at least not remember Olivia from his childhood? Yes, it was a long time ago but their relationship and memories survived Peter being erased from existence. 

Someone mentioned in another post of why didn't the observer that went to the future to get the piece for the machine just take the boy to the time they were trying to get him to? I get that he was being tracked but was he aware of it? It's something they should of addressed.

And I'm not gonna get into the time travel issues because those are just gonna happen when you are dealing with time travel. 

Any insight to these things would be awesome. Thanks!

1328993352.0,65,self.fringe,pl5ec,So is anybody else starting to suspect that Peter is shaping to become some kind of Fringe-verse techno-jesus?,token78,76,11,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/pl5ec/so_is_anybody_else_starting_to_suspect_that_peter/,"Sounds fruity I know, but the more I think about it, there's some pretty full on religious overtones to the Fringe story. The writers have been pretty good in not making it obvious, but when you lay out the plot to date, Peter really starts to look suspiciously like an understudy for Jesus. As in Peter's plot arc has managed to incorporate pretty much all of the characteristic elements of messianic belief and mythology.

First off there's the big one, Peter sacrificed his life to save the universes. And of course he rose again from the dead. There were ancient texts that predicted his coming, and which also prophesied that his actions could provide either salvation or destruction. And come on, in order to pass from this world, and make all these things come to be, he *just had* to be [strapped into a posture pretty much identical to crucifixion](http://joediliberto.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/fringedaywedied02.jpg).

Everyone bring it in.",DarenDark,70,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/swj87/after_worlds_apart_tonight_i_cant_handle_it/,"Im sure that when I say that Fringe has a special place in my heart, I am not alone.

Since I joined this subreddit a few months ago, I have eagerly debated and discussed every episode, sharing my enthusiasm and joy with all of you, who have likewise, shared your own. Although it would be cliche of me to state that I feel like we're one big family - I cannot deny that I, like Lincoln on the Other Side, feel strangely at home here. 

If you don't mind, I'd like to briefly reflect - or perhaps a more fitting word would be to *mourn* - those to whom we said goodbye tonight.

Ever since season 2, when we were first formally introduced to the Fringe Division, I developed a fondness for the Other Side. 

I enjoyed spotting everything from the little quirks that our character's dopplegangers possessed, to the heavy world-altering events that were so significantly different from Our Side. I can recall a time when we were almost required to fight against this Alternate Universe - almost as if *we were the same cortexiphan subjects that David Robert Jones employed tonight.*

But the longer I spent there, the easier it was to see the humanity in their eyes. The creases on their faces showed the trouble Our World put them through. The trouble our *characters* put them through. Despite this, I still felt like I wouldn't miss them much when they eventually disappeared. 

The episode in season 3, ""Bloodline"" was what completely won me over. The turning point for me, was the image of Alternate Lincoln - sitting on the floor of a shop in Chinatown - Altivia, who had just given birth, limp in his arms. To this day, that scene fills me with sadness. In those few seconds, I was overcome by such immense emotion, that I was instantly connected to both him and her and the whole Other Side. When Lincoln confessed his love for her in a murmured tone, a tear rolled down my face. I didn't know it then, but that wasn't the last time this show would make me feel that way.

The Alternate Universe became a constant in the Fringe Universe. Much like a loved one, I enjoyed every second of it. Much like a loved one, I looked forward to my next visit. 

Much like a loved one, you often forget that there may come a time when you will have to watch them go.

It is often said that you never know what you've got until it's gone. Today was as good of an example as any. I really miss them. As the machine was working, humming away ever louder, I found myself almost wishing for it to not work. For them to stay...

Today I mourn the loss of the Other Side. The World Just Like Ours, Only Slightly Different. I mourn a world that was severed tonight with little hope of returning. The only constant I now have left is you guys - this subreddit. Like Alternate Astrid, I wave a cautious goodbye, unknowing of what the future holds for all of us.

Lets hope it has rainbows.

*(And if you read to the end, thank you. That means a lot, especially when I get over-dramatic)*

I thought that was a spectacular ending, by the way. 'The Man Who Sold the World', the perfect ode to Walter? *And* Bell had stolen the record? That is some intense television right there, and a great soundtrack to go along.

Walter ultimately having go to through to the future, the part with Peter, Olivia and Henrietta in the field, and the letter that Peter received. Like, am I taking crazy pills, or was this not all completely obvious?

I absolutely loved the show through season 4, but starting with season 5 I just wasn't a huge fan, and after all the hype for the finale, and everyone raving about it, and the writers saying it was an amazing end... I just feel empty. I am simply not impressed, nor happy with how things ended.

The best part for me was the moment that Walter and Astrid had together, but that was literally the only part I enjoyed or didn't foresee happening.

Every other post seems to be ranting about how awesome the ending was, so I feel like I've gone insane. Completely, and thoroughly, unimpressed. And sad. Oh so sad.

Please, for all that is holy, someone tell me that I'm not the only person who feels this way.

EDIT: Lots of upvotes so far, which makes me feel like there are others out there that feel the same, but no comments so far. Please, speak your mind!

[Spoilers All Seasons],ErichUberSonic,57,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/1h9946/i_just_finished_the_series_had_some_thoughts/,"At some point in the first  season, I remember thinking to myself, well I guess this is just how the show's going to be. They get a weekly case, it's weird, they solve it, and move on. Maybe there will be some kind of large overall plot that moves on, but if there isn't that's okay because this is still really good sci-fi. Then things took off. 

I wasn't prepared how amazing the show was going to get. I'm not quite sure when it happened, probably sometime halfway through season two, maybe earlier. It went from good, to great. It was everything that a good show should be.  I never thought the concept of an alternate universe could be done effectively on television.  I was so wrong. 

I enjoyed the rest of the series. It took some turns I wasn't quite expecting, took some risks that didn't always pay off, but that's what made it memorable for me. I became attached to the charachters, like I'm guessing many of you did. I got many chills watching the power go off in the city behind Olivia during the final battle.  ""It's a lovely name"" and ""I love you, dad"" hit me so hard, I wasn't expecting that at all.  

I'm not sure what the point of this post is. I think it's hard to pinpoint what I liked so much about it. All I know is that Walter Bishop is one of my favorite all time characters in any medium and I'm really, really happy I decided to watch this show.

Here's a screenshot comparison of the two bullets: http://imgur.com/a/IVuMM

The bullet that Henrietta is carrying is the bullet that killed Olivia in the finale right? Not sure if it's been confirmed anywhere else, just wanted to make sure Olivia's not gonna die again ;_;

If it's the same bullet, it raises some interesting questions about where Olivia is in 2036. When future!Walter talks about ""what Bell did to her"" it could mean what Bell did to Olivia in the finale. Future!Walter's anger at Bell can be easily explained since Bell basically forced him to kill Olivia. So in 2036, Olivia's probably not dead and her status might not have anything to do with Bell.",,False,,t5_2qii0,True,,,True,t3_tjgid,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/tjgid/bullet_2036_spoilers/,

In one of the special features, one member of the show's staff talks about how they do their best to make sure the fringe science is at least based on some nugget of scientific truth, and  briefly mentions the [Uncertainty Principle.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle)

Now I'm no physicist, but I am a little familiar with the concept.  Within quantum physics, the principle dictates that the position and the momentum of a given particle cannot be known simultaneously.  The more precisely you know the position, the less precisely you know the momentum and vice versa.

This led me to discover a related concept in physics: [the Observer effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics\))

This concept **""refers to changes that the act of observation will make on the phenomenon being observed.""**

Sound familiar?

But this part really blew my mind:

&gt; The many-worlds interpretation posits the existence of multiple universes in which an observed system displays all possible states to all possible observers. In this model, observation of a system does not change the behavior of the system—it simply answers the question of which universe the observer is located in. In some universes, the observer would observe one result from one state of the system, and in others the observer would observe a different result from a different state of the system.

Incredible.  And it's been there, built into in the show, from the very beginning.  Sometimes I think these writers are too damn clever for their own good.",,False,,t5_2qii0,False,,,True,t3_pjppb,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/pjppb/observers_heisenberg_and_the_observer_effect/,

And what is with the continuing focus on ""case of the weeks""? I realize that when Fringe started they were trying to create a show with mythology that can also be dropped in and out of, but seriously, it's not working. We're supposed to get shitty storylines to try and lure newbies in still?

Fuck that, FOX/Writers. You've created such an interesting mythology with this show that I feel let down every time a ""COTW"" episode comes up.

Anyways, I'm just really losing faith in the writers. When the season started, I expected things to be moving at a fast pace, and some crazy revelations.

Instead, I get a fucking ""What if"" season (so far, anyways).

Next episode looks a bit better, but then FOX goes and pushes it 'til January (who the fuck pushes a Fall Finale?).

It's like they want this show to die, but don't want to say it.

edit: To be fair, this is a gross exaggeration. It doesn't suck, but as some have pointed out, I don't know who to care about :(",,False,,t5_2qii0,True,,,True,t3_mn2m5,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/mn2m5/ive_been_a_fringe_fan_since_the_series_premiere/,

This season has been an amazing ride. The action, the dialogue and character interactions. This show has been even more amazing. Instead of complaining about all of it, I'm going to rejoice in the fact that I got to be a part of something really cool.

Not really expecting it to come to pass, but if it did, I'd feel pretty bad if I didn't write about it first!

Walter playing God has been a major theme throughout the series.  We know that 1985 Walter was ruthlessly driven to expand his knowledge and that he was dismissive of any sort of limitation of that goal, be it ethical, moral, or religious.  Recently, in flashbacks, we've heard his old lab assistant Carla warn him about playing God and, memorably, he tells her ""There's only room for one God in this lab, and it's not yours.""

Then we have Peter, Walter's son from Another World.  Over the course of the show, we have learned that Walter's rescue of Peter, while born out of love, would ultimately destroy both Universes if left unchecked.

So Peter sacrifices himself.  He saves the world(s) and, in doing so, erases himself from existence.

But he comes back.  This ""resurrection"" is achieved not through a definable or calculable scientific feat, but through love.  Sounds a little familiar?

I think it would fitting with these themes if, in the end, we find out that Walter is somehow responsible for the creation of his universe in the first place.  In a certain respect, he becomes God.  But not the God he envisioned himself to be as a younger man.  This is God as a humble old man, a man terrified of losing himself in ambition and hubris, who can barely remember his phone number but knows he loves candy.

I also have a hunch that the Science Team of which September is a part is actually quite separate from the Observer invaders and have been working to aid us from the beginning.  There also happen to be twelve of them.  One might think of them as disciples.

Anyway, these biblical allegories have all been pretty subtle and if they continue with them as the show finishes up, I hope they stay subtle.  I'm not looking for any kind of big ""PETER IS JESUS"" reveal.  Nevertheless, it is an interesting lens through which to view the show's story.",,False,,t5_2qii0,False,,,True,t3_16bkl3,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/16bkl3/a_few_thoughts_on_walter_peter_and_god/,

1352206907.0,45,self.fringe,12q629,"Observers &amp; Timelines: What originally happened, what eventually happened (...and why Peter probably isn't the first Observer)",Overdrivex,55,10,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/12q629/observers_timelines_what_originally_happened_what/,"It's probably a bit early to be drawing up explanations given that the whole thing could change later on, but I'm just attempting to clarify for myself how I think it currently stands. Feel free to jump in, tell me I'm wrong, etc.

In the uninterrupted timeline, Walternate discovers the cure for Peter, and administers it, saving Peter's life. No war occurs between universes, and the Observers evolve from humanity on our side without interruption. However, the Observer science team have an innate ability to tell when someone is ""important"". Peter is one of these people, and September appears in the lab to observe, interrupting Walternate. September has ""an opportunity to fix this"", and dives in with his anti-freeze enhanced blood to save Peter.

Why was Peter identified as important in the first place? If they knew Peter would end up being part of the resistance that will eventually eradicate them, and father a girl who would do the same, they could have let him die; if he had simply grown up on the other side he likely wouldn't have been considered important. The Observers must therefore only have some vague sense of a person's importance - perhaps they cannot be specific, or they know that in their examination of billions of possible futures, particular individuals keep popping up as playing an integral part in history.

Once September saves him, they look into the changed future and can now see one of the possible ways that Peter could have ended up being ""important"": September's disruption of the timeline will culminate in the destruction of one universe, from a machine that appears to have been sent from that timeline's own future, and Peter's purpose in this timeline is to step into the machine to fix the problem. After all, it's the Observers' job to watch over timelines, and they can't simply leave this new-found time loop (build the machine, destroy the other side, send the machine back, repeat) without a conclusion. Peter's entry into the machine and making a different choice solves this timeline and seals it. The machine itself is a paradox, but the cycle of its creation is now complete.

However, Peter's joining of the universes creates an unexpected side effect. Walter's crossing over (the first ""crack"") caused the previously independent universes to have their fates become entwined, and ultimately to destroy each other. With Peter's alteration, from this point, the fate of the worlds is to be *joined* rather than destroyed. In the Red universe, before the timelines become intertwined, September still interrupts the search for cure, causing Walter to cross over. However, after the crack occurs, the new Amber universe timeline takes effect. September specifically travelled to save Peter from the lake in the **Blue** universe (""Blue destroyed Red"" timeline), and *not* the Amber universe (""Blue joins with Red"" timeline). Thus, September was absent in the Amber universe, and Peter drowns in Raiden Lake, causing Peter to vanish and a new history to be written.

The Observers have calculated that this will be the outcome - ""you were right, they don't remember Peter"", ""he served his purpose"" - but with their ability to see all possible combinations, deem that this outcome is acceptable, knowing that this version of the timeline satisfactorily resolves the timeline enough that order is restored, and that the Observers will still evolve. It also allows them to remove baby Henry, ""born to the wrong Olivia"" and who would have ""irrevocably altered everything"".

With Peter continuing to fluctuate in and out of the Amberverse, September is ordered to completely erase him with a machine built from parts in our time. However, he has a change of heart, as he has come to know and feel a connection to the past and the people in it, and makes the decision to go against the science team, allowing Peter to return. He must know that Peter's continued existence will be a threat to the timeline and potentially the future of the Observers but, as we find out by the end of season 4, it appears that he has decided to work against them, even at the cost of his own existence.

This also suggests that Peter is unlikely to be the first Observer. If the Observers knew that Peter was the progenitor of their species in any of the timelines, they would do everything in their power to ensure Peter was saved, but they have done the opposite at every turn. In fact, only September has done everything to save Peter, ultimately going so far as to assist Walter in creating a machine to eliminate the Observers. If the now sympathetic September knew that Peter would be the first Observer, he could simply have thrown the switch on his erasure device and that would have sealed their fate there and then: no need to wait for the invasion to occur.",,False,,t5_2qii0,1352220199.0,,,True,t3_12q629,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/12q629/observers_timelines_what_originally_happened_what/,

She is the one, the Olivia Dunham from whom your shared future was meant to spring. This must be, and everything will be as it was intended

So when Henry was born to Fauxlivia, it was *that* event that the Observers were so desperate to get rid of. It was supposed to go down like this:

1. Redverse Peter is cured by Walternate. (September didn't interrupt Walter, he was only supposed to observe this historic moment) 


2. At some point Redverse Peter and Blueverse Olivia meet after Olivia crosses over or something.


3. Peter and Olivia have Henry. (henry was supposed to born to blue/original Olivia and red universe peter . If Henry was born to them, parents from different universes, and to a mother who could walk across universes, then he would also have that ability and might be the next evolved human that maybe the observers originated from?)

but September screwed up and distracted Walter which led to a war between the universes and even though the observers tried to correct thing, everything just went wrong?

Some people even deign to watch Fringe siting it as a copy cat.  I recently overcame my childhood X-Files induced terror and began watching the show on Netflix. I have a few thoughts to share on the comparison. First, there are many similarities: a male and female pair investigating FBI cases, strange occurrences and even the title sequence. At the same time there are many differences. The obvious ones are the lack of aliens in Fringe and the presence of multiple universes. But I think the differences become much more noticeable when you examine how the cases are approached by the main characters. In the X-Files they never try to explain how the strange things happen. The whole premise of the show is that some things cannot be explained by science and logic or that we will never understand some things. They will discover what is going on but never why it's happening. For this reason I have decided that Fringe is much more compelling. Even if the show ends up using bad or pseudo-science they insist on spending all their effort on not only stop bad things from happening but also on understanding and explaining the real life cause of strange events. This approach is much more satisfying to me as a viewer and also as a scientist.

I was able to snag a couple shots before they asked me to put the camera away but i can give a visual description of what i saw. 

Description:
[The scene was set outside the Alternative Universe Fringe division building with logos and everything that appears. set up with NYC taxi's out in front covered in dirt and broken up. Other dirty and busted hybrid cars all over the street. No signs of any observers or anything related to them there. Anna Torv (as normal olivia from our universe) was there filming some shots, walking into the building. As well as Seth Gabel WITHOUT any makeup to make him look older.It looks as if he has jumped to the future himself or something. He was just standing around waiting for his scene i suppose.  He had more of the alternative universe Lincoln style than normal universe Lincoln.](/spoiler)

Only able to snap 2 pics but they are high enough res to see what is going on

This is more an observation than an actual theory, but it's one that I think could have implications for a potential theory. Of course, I could just be over-thinking things. 

Colours have always been a focus of the Fringe universe. Specifically the colours of each universe. I'm starting to notice that the episodes themselves have only 5 colours.

If you take white and black out of the equation (not actually colours), the new season (and even seasons past) have had a colour focus. In the surroundings of the episodes, in the clothing of the characters, in the devices being used etc.

Brown, Yellow, Red, Blue and Green. In everything. Never more. Never purple, never pink, never anything but those colours. Going back through the episodes of this season and even further, the Fringe team always wears a combination of only those colours. Walter's overcoat is greenish-brown. The human collaborators wear green jackets with red and yellow on them, and brown undershirts. 

Only ever seeing green foliage and no real flowers. 

Everything follows those colours. And different seasons have different tints to those colours. Season 4 was brighter, and this season the colours are darker (no doubt meant to reflect the sombreness and having overlords in the Observers). The Observers are the only things in the show (living things) that wear non-coloured clothing (Grey with white undershirts), maybe meant to show them as unemotional beings, or out of place characters. 

And the opening sequence for the shows has followed a similar pattern (also denoting different universes). Red, Blue, Grey and Yellow schemes. 

Clearly colours are important. What I don't know (outside the colours denoting different universes) is why? Any theories? ",,False,,t5_2qii0,False,,,True,t3_11kthi,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/11kthi/observation_about_fringe_and_the_new_season/,

I watched all the new episodes when they aired, read theories online, etc. But then when Season 3 started, I watched the first few episodes and then just.. stopped. I don't know why I stopped, I don't know if I had any reason to stop, but I just stopped. 

And that's weird because I was a huge fan during the first two seasons. Even now, while writing this, I'm remembering how awesome and interesting everything in the show was. 

So now I'm in this dilemma. I want to start watching the show again. BUT, I'm not sure where I should jump back in. I've *seen* every episode in the first two seasons, but I don't exactly *remember* them. 

I know the basic story arcs and what was generally happening, but Fringe seemed like a show that relied on you keeping up and remembering things. I'm afraid that if I start back up with season 3, I'll realize that I've forgotten about characters or stories that the show expects me to know and become completely lost. 

So what does r/fringe recommend that I do?

They have been shown to be mortal when [August was shot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_(Fringe) so we know they can die.  It stands to reason if they can die, they should have been born (or created) at one time or another.  September has an unexplained attachment to Walter, Peter and Olivia demonstrated when he saved Peter from the ice, met with Walter and they spoke, spoke with Olivia and also didn't erase Peter from time as he was instructed to do.

I started watching season 1 again and a thought struck me.  'Why would September act differently than the other Observers?'  The only logical thing I could think of is that he had a personal attachment to those characters which hasn't been explained yet.  Then I thought that if the Observers experience time differently then normal people, maybe he hadn't met them before he first saved Peter.  I hadn't read any theories on this but does anyone else think it's possible that September is the grown up child that they helped in [Inner Child](http://fringepedia.net/wiki/Inner_Child)?

It could explain his tendency to ignore his orders and to help the people who helped him when he was a child.

EDIT:  I've only gotten 1/2 through ep 5 as of last night.  My gf hadn't ever seen Fringe before and since she works in a medical field I thought she would like it.  I was explaining a few things to her without getting into spoilers and in ep 4 when we see September eating the roast beef sandwich I started explaining a bit about the Observers and their roles.  It just suddenly struck me that he acts different than he's supposed to and there must be a reason for it.  It seemed like after I knew everything that happened so far in the show and then went all the back to zero to try to explain a few things to her that really stuck out in my mind.",,False,,t5_2qii0,True,,,True,t3_phs3b,http://www.reddit.com/r/fringe/comments/phs3b/a_theory_i_thought_up_regarding_september/,

I enjoyed the show a bit, but my interest died down each episode, and I stopped watching Fringe altogether. It was the first time that I'd ever stopped watching a show mid-season. I just thought it was *that bad*. 

My roommate watches Fringe, and I've thought of picking it up again, only if it's much better. Has the show been able to tie everything together? My biggest complaint was that each episode, something would happen, but not contribute to the Thing, or whatever the major event was. That and the acting was excruciating to watch. Some of it was okay, but it just felt robotic and too scripted. Have the actors been able to change much?

I honestly would love to see where Fringe goes with everything, but don't want to waste time watching something that has no direction.

Sharp? - Could be, but they already had her raise Olivia.

Francis? - That would be nice for his widow to take Etta in, give her the team contacts. And it would be a nice nod to Charlie.

Broyles? - Could be.

Fayette? - Can't imagine him as much of a father.

Windmark? - even less fatherly &amp; I see no motivation for him to do it, but would explain Etta's ability to hide her thoughts. Also would be an intriguing possibility.

There seems to be a shift in time, similar but perhaps more subtle to what happened when Peter was erased, in this episode.

About 50 minutes in, shortly after the anti-matter baton  knocks out the first wormhole the van stops in an alley and P&amp;O look to see a new wormhole has opened up and equipment from the future is rolling again.  There are no posters on the walls of the alley at this point.

After commercial break, Peter talks to Walter who thinks that the action they just took should have knocked out the efforts on the future end of the wormhole for a long time. Peter makes a decision and stalks off to confront the captured Observer.

Shortly after that, the walls of the alley are shown again. Only this time they are plastered with posters of Etta  with the word ""resist.""  So Could the timeline have shifted?  Could something have been erased from the TL upstream, timewise?

Could the anti-matter baton been much more effective than  it originally looked?  The new wormhole could have come from 10, 20, 50 years further in the future than the one the team destroyed. And the destruction may have affected shipments to the past earlier than 2036 or killed Observers sent there as part of the occupying force. This might have weakened the Observers' hold to the point that those posters could have been more freely put up, or not removed in a timely fashion.

Either that, or they cut out some footage where the van stops again in a different alley (the van is at a different angle &amp; closer to the wall).  Something to think about.

UPDATE: Looking more closely at the evidence, the posters appear immediately after Peter makes his decision to get more answers from the captured Observer.  That, rather than the black hole in the worm hole, may be the origin of the time shift.
