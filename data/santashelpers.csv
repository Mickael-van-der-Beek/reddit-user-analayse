1) Please include the recipient's hobbies, likes, and idiosyncrasies *in detail*. Detail is important to get the best gift/recipient match. If your niece loves lego, people can help you a lot. If your niece loves lego *and* Harry Potter, we can help you even more!

2) Please include your budget. 

3) Please specify which country you are in. Reddit is an international website, and the availability and ease of shipping for many items will depend substantially on what country you and your recipient are in.

Suggestions for replying:

1) Please be polite, helpful, and reply with as much information as possible. 

2) Please include links where possible. Images of the item you are describing are good. Links to stores that sell the item are better. Links to Amazon or similar sites where the item can be bought online are best!

3) If you are suggesting an item that you have created or that you are selling, please make that clear in your reply. There will not be sanctions for promoting/suggesting your own items unless you do so continuously and/or where such an item is clearly unrelated to what OP is looking for. 

**EDIT**: If you say ""blowjobs"" or ""cunnilingus"" or ""sex"" your comment will be deleted. We've all heard that a million times. It isn't helpful, funny or original. Jokes are fine here, but don't be reddit's Carlos Mencia, tell your own jokes.

**SECOND EDIT**: The mods have heard the repeated suggestions for a standard format to title posts with. It's the most common suggestion here, so we're looking at it and taking it very seriously. Please give us a bit of time on this, the subreddit has only existed for 6 hours so far, and it's already attracted 2,762 subscribers, so we're scrambling a bit to get the house in order.

They're all things I've either been given, or have given. 

**TECHNOLOGY**

[Logitech G500]( http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002J9GDXI/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=snewzbuttonco-20&amp;camp=213381&amp;creative=390973&amp;linkCode=as4&amp;creativeASIN=B002J9GDXI&amp;adid=1AXMMH6PFASVA3VPCBNB&amp;&amp;ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Frcm.amazon.com%2Fe%2Fcm%3Flt1%3D_blank%26bc1%3D000000%26IS2%3D1%26bg1%3DFFFFFF%26fc1%3D000000%26lc1%3D0000FF%26t%3Dsnewzbuttonco-20%26o%3D1%26p%3D8%26l%3Das4%26m%3Damazon%26f%3Difr%26ref%3Dss_til%26asins%3DB002J9GDXI) A redditor gave me this one (licenseplate, I think), and it’s one of the coolest mice I’ve ever had.

[Razer Deathadder]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q4U5DK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Q4U5DK&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – Anyone who I know who doesn’t like my Logitech mouse loves this one. I don’t really like it as much, but I get a fair amount of mouse envy from certain people. 

[Sparkfun Inventor’s Kit]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005FMNJ3S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005FMNJ3S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – This one is actually $100, but I didn’t see anyone else post it, and I love mine. It’s a nice set and gives a gentle introduction to the concepts of programming and setting up a circuit board. It’s pretty good for aspiring nerds. Seasoned nerds may like it, too.

**BOOKS**

[The Casual Vacancy]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316228532/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316228532&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – JK Rowling’s new book. Apparently, it’s more for adults, since it refers to some political position that opened up due to the death of a politician. My sister lent this to me, and I’m pretty much liking it.

[Devil in the White City]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375725601/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0375725601&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – This book is about a serial killer who was practicing his craft during the time of the Chicago World’s Fair in the 1890’s. It also takes on the perspective of the man who was chief architect organizing the World’s Fair. It’s one of the most interesting reads I’ve had in years.

[Confederacy of Dunces]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802130208/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0802130208&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – This is a really funny book written by a man suffering from severe depression. The degree of candidness is astonishing. It’s unfortunately the author’s only book, since he killed himself before it was published.

[The World of Mathematics]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486432688/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0486432688&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20). It’s a 4-volume set of books on the history of mathematics. If this sounds like heaven to you, buy it for yourself. If it sounds like hell, buy it for someone you think is a nerd.

[Pocket Ref]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1885071620/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1885071620&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – This is really inexpensive, but I love mine. I often find myself giving a copy to people who I work with, because they all seem to want to borrow mine. It’s got a lot of really handy information in it, and the internet isn’t always available for when you need to know some screwy fact about engineering-type stuff.

[Moleskine notebook]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883701127/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=8883701127&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – This is blank. No words in it, yet, but it makes an incredible diary, journal, project book, or other book where you really want to keep what you’re writing. It’s hella classy, too.

**OTHER STUFF**

[Denali 115-piece Tool Kit]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDHGWU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000HDHGWU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – This is a basic home tool kit. The quality is pretty good, and a lot of people don’t have an adequate and organized set of tools in their house. I’ve given this to a few people and they always mention it after a year or so, because they didn’t realize how handy it was to have organized tools in their lives. Don’t underestimate this present. Girls can use it, too.

 [A proper Leatherman]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002H49BC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0002H49BC&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – Definitely something you’re going to want to have, so it’s something you should want to give.

[Horse Mask]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003G4IM4S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B003G4IM4S&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – Maybe this one is a little older, but anyone who hasn’t had a horse mask yet is missing out.

[Casio FX-115]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004TVDO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00004TVDO&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – A quality scientific calculator. It’s not a graphing calculator, it’s a scientific calculator. It does all sorts of nice things.

[Dry Erase Board]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KO9JB0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002KO9JB0&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – This is handy as fuck. I feel that my life has found so much organization because of mine. Don’t forget the [markers and eraser]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006IFIV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00006IFIV&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20).

[French Press](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ADS5TU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B005ADS5TU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) - There's no better way I know to prepare coffee that doesn't involve riding a burro through the mountains of Colombia.

[Cold Steel Kukri with Cordura Sheath](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FJRR2K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000FJRR2K&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) - I almost forgot this one. It's basically a badass machete. It's great camping and for yard work. I've had mine for 2 years and it's still awesome.

[Folding Hand Truck](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HVVSDU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000HVVSDU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) - I drive a pickup. Most of my friends don't. I often find myself helping people move things. I can keep this under the back seat and it's always ready to go. Incredibly handy.

[The Settlers of Catan](http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=snewzbuttonco-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B000W7JWUA) - Really fun board game, filled with strategy, tactics, and opportunities to screw with your friends' plans.",,False,,t5_2vjt7,1355589606.0,,,True,t3_14fawl,http://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/14fawl/suggestions_a_lot_of_practical_things_that_a_lot/,

I went to my local butcher and order a ""1/4 cow""*. The beef was from a high-quality breed raised in the area. My butcher gave me a weight range to work with, and let me pick out what cuts/quantities I wanted before cutting the order. 

Did I feel a little tacky presenting them with a chilly, crudely wrapped cardboard box? Yes. But did that 'tacky feeling' vanish when they opened it and realized I had given them the glorious gift of thick tenderloins, marbled steaks, and all other choice cuts of top-notch red meat? Couldn't tell ya- I was too busy polishing my monocle and calling for more caviar.

Baskets or boxes are pretty easy to find for cheap at the dollar store.
Then, for example, I'll put together a ""movie night"" basket with a box of microwave popcorn, a pack of Twizzlers and a box of Junior Mints (or other sorts of typical movie theatre treats) and then a DVD or a Netflix gift card.

Some other ideas I've done:
An ice cream sundae gift basket with sprinkles, chocolate sauce, waffle  sundae bowls and a gift card to Diary Queen or Baskin Robbins.

Every year for my grandparents I put together a basket with their favorite bottle of wine and a bunch of their favourite goodies (Purdy's chocolates, licorice, pretzels)

A basket full of all the ingredients to make a meal or a batch of cookies or brownies. 

For lady-friends (or man-friends who are so inclined), a small gift basket with nail polish, a nail file, nail polish remover, hand cream, etc.

Once you think of a theme the ideas come together pretty easily!

Two are 13/14 (basically preteen boys). As it stands, the only information I've wrangled is that they like computer games. When I asked for wishlists, they just told me that the big presents they are getting are ""A new upgraded computer"" and the other one asked for a ""nice headset."" So those gifts are being bought by other people as I understand it. But maybe that's a lead...

The other two are an 18 year old girl who's really in to photography, and is saving up for a $1500 (ohgodwhy) camera.

And a 21 year old who likes computers and video games. his computer is kindof old so he is the only one I have any idea for: buy him a new video card.

Then there is a 24 year old with a baby girl. Im not sure what to get her, something useful for someone with a baby maybe (baby is less than a year old, this will be its first christmas).
 
And a 26 year old, into japanese stuff, linux, programming, etc. For him, I was looking at those katana umbrellas (or the ones like from blade runner) but id like any ideas.

Sorry for the long post. Im drunk, locked out of my apartment by my roomates (deadbolt, so key doesn't help lol- honeybadger don't care), and on my neighbors couch at 4am thinking about christmas shopping and cookies. So please excuse grammar. Ill clarify things later if people ask. I can't tell if im making sense, sorry.

Any help/hints/ideas would be greatly appreciated. Oh, and im not sure if relevant, but: Im going to be shipping these presents to an off site location away from peeking eyes, because I've got limited vehicle room for presents on the drive up.

Since I'm putting the infusion into 8oz mason jars, I'll be able to give it to about 25 people for a total of ~$80, which breaks down to a little over $3 per person for a unique and tasty gift. They look snazzy if you cut out custom tags and tie them around the jars with ribbon too.

Here's the recipe:
Making Cranberry Spice Infusion

- 1 bottle (750 ml) Fris Vodka

- 1 cup fresh or frozen cranberries

- 5 whole cloves

- 1 whole nutmeg, cracked

- 1 teaspoon whole coriander seed, cracked

- 1/2 a whole vanilla bean

- 1/2stick cinnamon, cracked

- 6 whole allspice berries, cracked

Place cranberries and spices in an infusion jar and top with vodka. Let infuse for 2 - 3 days, then strain and place infused Fris Vodka in an attractive container.

I usually sub in pre-ground spices, shake it twice a day or so, and strain it with cheesecloth or a coffee filter just to make tracking down the spices a little easier.

1358053013.0,20,self.santashelpers,16h6nj,[Suggestion] For a gun owner / hunter / enthusiast. [any/any/any],Chainmail_Danno,27,7,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/16h6nj/suggestion_for_a_gun_owner_hunter_enthusiast/,"Age and gender don't really matter. The price is all up to you, though a good starting point is $50. There are still good things that can be had for less. 

Keep in mind that I will link mostly to manufacturer or retail pages, so prices will be somewhat inflated. You might need to do some additional searching to find better prices. 

I will admit that I am weak in certain areas, mainly hunting, reading material, and gun hardware. If you have something to add, please feel free to post and I'll add it here. 

In the world of guns, there are way too many accessories and gift ideas to list here. I'll provide a broad outline. If you need a more specific suggestion, don't hesitate to ask. However, take caution before buying. The world of firearms is a very specific place. You must be sure that your gift will be compatible with your shooter's needs, or that you're able to return your product if something is not a match. 

Alright, here we go.

------------------

General: 

* You can never go wrong with ammo. Magazines (the ones for bullets) are also a good bet. Spend as much as you want here. 

* There are plenty of gun magazines (the ones with words) to subscribe to. Find one that suits your shooter's interests.

* Something from [Magpul](http://store.magpul.com/) or [EOtech.](http://www.eotech-inc.com/) Prices vary from $50 to thousands. 

* General hunting gear and apparel (boots, clothes, etc) can be found easily through a Google search. 

* You could arrange to have your shooter's gun colored, camouflaged, or otherwise designed. Kits can be purchased, but it may be best to consult with your shooter beforehand. 

* For non-shooting gun enthusiasts, or people not allowed to own functional firearms (for whatever reason), consider getting replica display guns. Prices will vary. 

* Consider signing up for self-defense, marksman, or safety training classes.  

---------------------------

Less than $60:

* Reactive (explosive) targets. Need I say more? [Tannerite](http://www.tannerite.com/) for a good time. 

* Gun cleaning supplies / kits. [Otis](http://www.otistec.com/Products/Hunting_and_Sporting.asp) is a good place to start. Notes: Try to avoid screw-together rods. They can damage the barrel rifling.

* Safety supplies. [Electronic muffs](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/671923/howard-leight-impact-sport-electronic-earmuffs-nrr-22-db-green) are good for light shooting. If you're playing with high caliber rounds, you may need to wear earplugs under the muffs. Don't forget some stylish [eye protection,](http://www.safetyglassesusa.com/shooting-glasses.html) too.

* [Magazine loaders.](http://www.midwayusa.com/find?userSearchQuery=magazine+loader)  

* Soft gun cases. Here are some from [Allen](http://allencompany.net/gun-cases.html).

* Zombie-hunting ammo. This is mostly a humorous item, but it is live ammo and can be fired. Sold by [Hornady.](http://www.hornady.com/ammunition/zombiemax) 

* [Gun Slings.](http://www.cabelas.com/slings.shtml)

* [Snap Caps.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_cap) Make sure you get the correct caliber. 

* A [12 Gauge thermos.](http://www.buyholsters.com/product/Stansport-12-Gauge-Shotgun-Shell-Thermos)

* Books. Admittedly, I need help in this category. From experience, I can only speak for [this book.](http://www.amazon.com/Total-Gun-Manual-Field-Stream/dp/1616282193/) It briefly covers several topics, but would be best suited for someone new to hunting. Regardless, it is an informative and enjoyable book.

---------------------------------

$60 to $150:

Keep in mind that pretty much everything listed above can be stepped up a notch. So, moving forward.

* [Bolt action tactical pen.](http://uncrate.com/stuff/bolt-action-tactical-pen/) Yup, it's a pen.  

* [Hard gun cases](http://www.midwayusa.com/find?dimensionids=10801) and [range bags.](http://www.midwayusa.com/find?userSearchQuery=range+bags) If you're artistic, you could do some custom artwork on these cases.

* Custom engraved [pistol grips.](http://www.westvirginiawoodarts.com/Gungrips.html)

* In this price range, [binoculars](http://www.midwayusa.com/find?userSearchQuery=binoculars) are best suited for target shooting and spotting. Hunters will need better gear.   

* Entry-level scopes and optics. Glass gets *very* expensive, and quickly. However, $150 will buy a very decent scope for .22lr plinking, varmint hunting, or target shooting. 

----------------------------

$150 to $300:

Now we're getting into the price range of new or used firearms. 

And again. Everything listed above can be improved. 

* Lower receiver custom engraving. This one might be difficult to pull off. You would have to either get the receiver from your gun owner, check if your local gun shop does engraving, or buy a whole new receiver online.

* Mosin Nagant. A cheap Russian surplus Mosin can be had for around $150. I'm not familiar with its ammo prices.

* Ruger 10/22, or other .22lr rifle. My Ruger 10/22 with synthetic stock and stainless barrel cost me $325 from a big retail store, but that was a year ago. Every shooter needs a .22lr. It's the perfect rifle to learn the basics on, or simply have a good time at the range. A box of 550 rounds cost about $20 a month ago. That's a whole day of fun.
 

-----------------------

$300 to $600:

Now we're getting into the range of good scopes and other sights. Upgraded rails, stocks, grips, or other hardware are in this price range, too. Additionally, $600 can buy a wide range of firearms. Leave a comment if you need a specific recommendation. 

Something, above, improved. 


--------------------

More than $600:

The sky is the limit here. There are so many guns and other products on the market that it would be impossible to list them all. Use the above information to get an idea of what you want, then leave a comment here if you need more help to satisfy a specific shooter's needs.

--------------------


Keep checking. I'm updating every chance I get.

Thanks for reading.

I really need a gift idea for my boyfriend - the guy who has everything. 

To start off, I want to clarify that I have come up with some great ideas, but my boyfriend is the sort of guy that goes out and buys what he wants days after mentioning he wants it. I always seem to rush out to the store and buy the perfect gift, only to find out that he purchased it for himself the same day. This has happened multiple times, and I'm left scrambling trying to find a new gift that he would like and enjoy. I don't want that to happen this year!

My boyfriend is the kind of guy who has everything. He's very into tech and gadgets and owns an iphone, ipad, 2 laptops, an e-reader and every video game console you could imagine. He really enjoys gaming (both PC and console) but his interest in video games seems to come and go with every next big thing. He's the sort of guy who gets really excited about a new game, buys it, then only plays it 10 times or so. I've attempted to buy him new video games several times, and he goes out and buys it for himself. I'm also not into the whole video game thing, so I really struggle with picking games that he would be into. It seems like every game he mentions in conversation, he goes out and buys for himself. The only gift I've ever gotten him that he seems to enjoy is a computer mouse made for PC gaming. He is also very into writing, but gifts like a journal and pen set have been a total flop in past years. He is a drummer, and I was planning on getting the heads of his snare drum replaced for this christmas, but instead he went to Guitar Center, and traded in his old snare for a new one. I've also thought about purchasing him some cool effect style sticks (like brushes or the padded ones) but after some careful snooping, it looks like he owns those already. I was thinking of maybe purchasing him beard oil, since he does have a rather nice beard but I'm unsure if he would use that type of product. He also really enjoys reading sci-fi style books.

- recent interest in men's fashion and finding well-made, interesting items (he's been frequenting MFA subreddit lately)

Now that Christmas has come upon us, I thought it would be a great idea if we can start a ""Received Gift"" thread. Even though I imagine most of you have either finished with their shopping, or already know what you are getting people, it is not too early to think about next Christmas/Birthday. So in this thread I'd like people to post what you received as a gift this year.

Some simple rules:

* You must post your Age, Sex, and Relationship between you and the giver, 
* Mention hobbies you you feel willing.
* Do not post obvious gifts (Example: ""I got an iPad!"" or ""My SO gave me Diamond earrings!!')
* Really only post gifts that surprised you, and were a unique idea.

One more thing. Please feel free to post any other gift problems you may have over the course of the year.

I knew that he had a college fund for me throughout my life, but when I actually got to college I was shocked to see how much was in there.  He completely paid for all of my schooling, and would occasionally give me extra money so I could have some to spend to go out with friends so I could quit my waitressing job that I'd been doing for pocket money.  He's not an emotional man and every time I tell him thank you it's ""Ah, well you know I just want you kids to have a good education and not worry about money.  It's nothin'.""  Keep in mind he has these same college funds for my sister and all my other cousins, which adds up to a lot of dough.

I ended up as an engineer as well and that's probably the most excited I've ever seen him outside of a really good football game.  Last year I got him a DVD set of some westerns (which he honestly probably had already seen ten times over, but he would never tell me that).  This year I really want to give me something he'll really enjoy.  As I said, he likes westerns and football and used to be a mechanical engineer.  He doesn't really care about getting a bunch of new technology or anything.

Both like: Coffee, chocolate, healthy food (my friend was saying how much she would LOVE a steak and fresh grilled asparagus and a salad after a month at the hospital).

Wife likes: Cooking, books, eating healthy (paleo, because she's allergic to gluten) good books, horses, farming, goats, chickens, etc.

Husband likes:  Nice cigars, good alcohol (like scotch and stuff), soccer, books, rugyby, etc.

If you know of something funny to buy them (they have a wicked, delightful sense of humor - husband is a redditor and the wife would be if she had the time).

Any and all ideas are accepted - if you think of a perfect one worth more than $30, share it - they're going to be in the hospital for months and I may be able to raise money for it.

They're having difficulty showering, because they have to drive an hour and a half home to do it, so I feel like something related to eating (either healthy or chocolate), showering, or coffee might be the best bet.

He is 23 and I am 22. We are in Australia. Honestly my budgest is pretty flexible, but I dont want to spend too much if I dont have to.

For our 6 months we both (total coincidence) got each other a framed photograph of us together (I realise many people dont celebrate 6 months, but I was going through some rough things at the time and he thought it might give me something good to focus on) so that has already been done. This past Christmas I got him the Marvel Comics edition of Monopoly which he thought was the best gift ever. 

He is very interested in gaming (traditional old school stuff like Zelda and Pokemon as well as more modern stuff which I am now out of touch with) and has lots of shirts with references/ jokes from video games. He likes board games especially Monopoly and Cranium. He rides a motorcycle and likes movies such as Lord of the Rings, Iron Man, The Avengers, Batman, basically any of the comic book related ones actually. His favourite superhero is Spiderman, but he is in love with the concept of capes. He loves the IT Crowd, Futurama, Star Wars.

I want to get him something thoughtful but not too over the top, as its an anniversary not a birthday gift. My initial thoughts were to make a framed photo collage with photos of us, some of his favourite things and mabye some good quotes. But im not sure if thats a good gift idea, or if he will even enjoy it. I also worry that it is too similar to what I gave him for our 6 month.

I guess most of my ideas would be perfet for a girl for an anniversary, but I'm not sure if a guy will think they are a bit lame. I know he will appreciate anything I get him, but I want him to really love it and think im the most awesome girlfriend in the world for getting it for him.

He served in the US Navy for 40 years, during WWII, and was very proud of his service. He is in constant pain. He has shingles, and nothing would make him happier than getting rid of his pain.

Today, he lives a very quiet life, but tries to stay active. He constantly tries to fix things, build things, just keeps moving. He still goes to the grocery store, plays Diablo 3 (he's had it since it came out, still hasn't finished it, but it tires him out now so video games are not an option anymore), he loves coffee and uses a Tassimo every day. He walks around our back yard sweeping every day. He reads the newspaper and does the crossword puzzles every day, sometimes he doesn't finish. He watches a lot of TV, mostly TV Land. He loves Bonanza. He talks to the dog when he thinks no one is listening.

Boyfriend is a game developer, but I feel like he has little time to actually PLAY video games because he is too busy making them(saying, ""just get him video games,"" won't cut it). Also, all of the electronics he pines after are in the $1000 range.

Things he doesn't react well to:

* Any type of clothing or accessory

* Car stuff

* Bacon-y things

* DVDs

Things (i think) he would like:

* Art books 

* nerd art to hang on walls

* PC games

* Strange novelty gifts that have to do with nature/technology 

* Good fantasy novels

* Nerd stuff (Legend of zelda)

* good sculptures/figurines

* sour sugary candies

I know that this might not be practical for people who don’t live near a landmark or someplace similar, so if that is not possible, maybe a creative photo (ex, beach with name scribbled in sand, or with rocks) with the message in it is fine as well. I have about a month, so I would love to get these as soon as possible. Also, if you can’t do it, but know of someone who can, that would be awesome as well.

He's a major drinking enthusiast (to a self-destructive point sometimes, and no, an intervention is not the present I want to give to him) and my first thought was a texas mickey of whiskey, but the more I consider it the more I feel like he'll end up killing himself with it. Maybe some kind of craft beer? If so, how much is appropriate?

He loves hunting, but, alas, has everything he could ever need to it. He doesn't need things like a cool knife, or binoculars, or trail camera.  I know that he doesn't have one of those archery targets that's shaped like an animal, but I feel like if he wanted one, he'd have it. I don't really want to buy him ammo as I feel it would be a cop-out. 

He's big into Star Wars, Star Trek, Game of Thrones, Palahniuk, Hemingway, etc. He's big into chess, online poker, Call of Duty, and the HP fanfiction stories by Cassandra Claire. 

I wanted to get him a charcoal grill, but his best friend informed me that that's what he's already purchased for him. He doesn't really cook all that much, although the deer he killed this past hunting season was just delivered to his house. A deer cookbook? 

He's acknowledged that he's very difficult to shop for, and suggested that we just not exchange gifts this holiday. It's tempting but I feel like even exchanging simple gifts is important to me.

Last year for Christmas I got her a hanging plaque with a cute quote/image about Jack Russell Terriers, some Publix Christmas ornaments, reusable grocery bags (with cute designs on them), and a ton of home-made Christmas cookies. She really enjoyed these gifts.

The three zero is coming up for my GF. She tends to purchase higher quality brands/items and use them for years (over lots of smaller items), although she's only a brand girl as far as quality goes - a cheaper item that's well made and will be versatile (like a nice kitchen item that can be used for 2-3 things well) is always appreciated. Small size + clean look + bright color is appreciated. For example, we own &amp; she loves [this](http://www.amazon.com/Swissmar-Borner-V-1001-V-Slicer-Mandoline/dp/B0000632QE) in a bright orange. Also own/love a set like [this](http://www.wellpromo.com/upload/upimg81/24-Piece-Etno-Flatware-Rack-Se-80281.jpg), although ours is higher-quality than this pic shows. Also own a set similar to [this](http://www.lenox.com/dinnerware/continental-dining-platinum/lenox?A=32300&amp;An=1434&amp;Au=p_pattern_id&amp;cmCatid=e1434) without the gold ring. As you can tell, kitchen is important ;-) price is somewhat flexible - I'm not made of money but this is important

**items**

* I have airline miles, so the big item is likely a trip to CA for a wine tour
* I really want to order a two-handled soup bowl like [this](http://www.vintageamericanpottery.com/fiestaware/Riviera_Pottery_Rare_Fiestaware_Ivory_Cream_Soup_Bowl_For_Sale_Depression_Era_Pottery_01.jpg)!! Shape/size of handles is flexible.  I'd like to personalize it with a line of text, and (if possible), I'd really love if it had that thermal text that shows when hot and hides when cold. I tried zazzle.com but they only carry mugs. Any links would be wonderful to help me search!!
* Considering a nice tea pot/set (e.g. [this](http://www.teavana.com/tea-products/teapots-teapot-sets/cast-iron-teapots/p/prosperity-koi-cast-iron-teapot) )
* I'd love other ideas :-) Some other interest areas: tea, knitting, books, russian / eastern Europe history and culture, art/fashion

*     Zombie apocalypse kit: I put together some gag and survival items to ward off a zombie attack. It was cute and timely seeing as we were watching The Walking Dead. (If anyone is interested I can list what all I comprised the ""kit"" of)
* Homemade picnic basket
* I created a homebrew logo and etched it onto pint glasses

I got him concert tickets to a band for Christmas and I have some little things for his birthday but I want something AWESOME.

He's pretty geeky and is a big fan of Harry Potter, Star Wars, and Lord of the Rings.  I've checked out thinkgeek.com but nothing jumped out at me.

The ""classic boy gifts"" don't seem like things he would want or he already has them.  Last Christmas he got headphones from his family, he got a new wallet this year, he doesn't wear cologne or watches, and being under 21, many gifts like home brewing kits or beer glasses aren't appropriate.  

He's a pretty big TV junkie, some of his favorite series include The West Wing, Psych, and Community.  He's pretty interested in Archer and Arrested Development right now as well.

He loves gaming (PS3 and emulators for Fire Emblem and Pokemon) but plays in friend's rooms because he doesn't have a TV in his own room.

If you have any additional ideas, comment in!",kowalski71,9,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/13836w/suggestion_good_gifts_for_motorheadscar/,"I know that many of you will have someone who likes cars on your lists, be it an uncle who's an armchair muscle car enthusiast or someone who races and works on their own cars. As a serious car guy I think I have some good general suggestions for those people. I'll edit it in some new stuff as I think of it.

**Books/TV/Movies:**

* There are a lot of very informative and nice looking books on cars, ranging from dense technical books to beautiful coffee table books. If this person has a favorite make, model, or type of racing you can probably find something on it. I would suggest a nice history of [insert brand, model, racing series, etc here] coffee table book like [this one on Corvettes](http://www.amazon.com/Corvette-Sixty-Years-Randy-Leffingwell/dp/0760342318/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352954069&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=corvette+history) or [one on the history of Formula 1](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Formula-1-Race-Car/dp/0760337314/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352954094&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=f1+history+coffee+table+book).

*  Outside of Amazon another good source is [Motorbooks](http://www.motorbooks.com/), lots of good stuff there.

*  If someone is a DIYer try getting them the Haynes or Chilton manual for their car. These are how-to repair manuals for specific models of cars and they're very useful. Most of them are on Amazon and they're usually around $20.

* Top Gear is a British auto enthusiast show. It's well done and incredibly popular. They mostly focus on newer European cars. [DVDs of their seasons](http://www.amazon.com/Top-Gear-18-Brian-Klein/dp/B007Q0JHYC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352954167&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=top+gear+dvd) would be great for someone into that kind of thing.

* Unfortunately I don't have the time to link all of these but a brief list of good car movies:

&gt; Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 version or 1974 version)

&gt; Fast and Furious series

&gt; The World's Fastest Indian (great movie)

&gt; Senna

&gt; Grand Prix (1966)

&gt; Le Mans (1971)

&gt; Two-Lane Blacktop (for older American car enthusiasts)

&gt; American Graffiti

&gt; The Gumball Rally and Cannonball Run

&gt; Tucker: The Man and his Dreams

&gt; Vanishing Point (1971)

&gt; The Doctor the Tornado and the Kentucky Kid, Faster, Fastest (documentaries about MotoGP racing)

&gt; Long Way Down/Long Way Round (adventure motorcycle riding TV series)

**Memorabilia:**

* Again, if there's a favorite make this is a good place to go. T Shirts, flags, keychains, etc can all be had for most manufacturers.

* If you're handy with needle and thread, a nice thing to do is unite a patch and something else. Last year we bought basic patches off of eBay of the logo of my father and grandfather's favorite marque. Then we bought [roll up tool bags](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Ergodyne-5870-Roll-Up-Tool-Bag-Tool-Pouch-Organizer-/310484552607?pt=Tool_Boxes_Storage&amp;hash=item484a524b9f), stitched them on, and had a very nice custom gift. eBay will probably be your best source for patches.

* Vintage memorabilia is also a lot of fun, scour eBay for old promotional material or flyers.

* Old license plates are fun. If the vehicle is old enough, try to find one from the same year. Depending on the state, before 1970 the year was stamped into the plate. If you can find one from the same year as their project car or the year they were born they can hang it in the garage. Some states let you register your car under a vintage plate if the number is currently available! eBay will be your best source for this.

* A hubcap makes a nice wall piece. For example, [these Mercedes hubcaps](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1982-MERCEDES-300D-Hubcap-Rim-Wheel-Cover-Euro-Hub-Cap-USED-OEM-/330825213691?pt=Motors_Car_Truck_Parts_Accessories&amp;hash=item4d06b826fb&amp;vxp=mtr) look great polished and hung on a wall.

Sometimes because they're a luxury or maybe they just haven't thought to buy them yet. Most of these are under $30 as well. I could probably hit the character limit for this post adding all the possible cheap, small tools that everyone could use and probably don't have.

* For the budding car enthusiast a 155 piece tool set will be a cherished gift for years to come. Mine was given to me when I was 12 and it's still a favorite possession. [Link 1 for $150](http://www.sears.com/craftsman-182-pc-mechanics-tool-set-with-3/p-00933182000P?prdNo=4&amp;blockNo=4&amp;blockType=G4), [link 2 for $300](http://www.sears.com/craftsman-283-pc-mechanics-tool-set-with-tool/p-00935283000P?prdNo=2&amp;blockNo=2&amp;blockType=G2). Craftsman are good quality tools at a decent price point and have a lifetime warranty.

* For someone who already has a decently established home shop, an [air compressor](http://www.sears.com/craftsman-4-gallon-pancake-air-compressor-with-hose/p-00915215000P?prdNo=8&amp;blockNo=8&amp;blockType=G8) ($150-$200) is a nice luxury. You can also get someone an air compressor and ask relatives and other family members to get tools to go with it ($30-$50), which is a nice common thread.

**Other:**

* If you know that there's a particular company that sells a lot of parts for this person's project car they most likely do gift cards. For example, [International Auto Parts](http://www.international-auto.com/) is a huge vendor of Italian car parts and I drive an Alfa Romeo. [Summit Racing](http://www.summitracing.com/) and [Jegs](http://www.jegs.com/) are both good general, universal component companies that most people could blow some money on. [YearOne](https://yearone.com/) makes parts for vintage American cars (muscle cars and the such).

* This is a good gift for anyone that drives, a [Just in case kit](http://www.amazon.com/Just-Piece-Safety-Roadside-Assistance/dp/B005KR3A1E/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352953943&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=justincase+kit). This includes jumper cables, tire repair kits, a flashlight, and some basic repair stuff. You should really have one in every vehicle.

First Christmas, I got her a really nice pair of UGG boots which she loves. Second Christmas I got her something misc. (can't remember) but an expensive plane ticket / concert ticket to come see me and Avicii at home.

Now, this Christmas. I'm flying to see her at home. My budget is probably between $100-200, as I've got an expensive Valentine's Day present lined up for her. We're about to be seniors in college. She likes thoughtful things. She likes clothes, but would probably prefer something else. She likes jewelry, but again, I think would prefer something else (I got her jewelry last birthday). I want to get her something thoughtful. If I could find an awesome dress for her, it could work. Though she's stressing about her fluctuating between a size 2/4, so I'm not sure. 

She's a 'lil southern belle, but she's got a hip side to her. I will try to be more helpful in the comments, but please throw out any ideas you may have based on my relatively vague list of interests. Feel free to ask questions and I'll provide as much info as I can. Thanks guys!

* He is also VERY into Game of Thrones. I'm just afraid I've exhausted this gift route. (I got him a custom 'Hand of the King' replica, and lots of other GoT swag.) We watch Walking Dead together, but that's more my thing than his. We went to Comic Con together and he loved every second of it.

I need your help, please.

I have a very old (90) grandmother who while suffering from cancer, is actually in remarkably good health. She has the busiest social life out of anyone I know, she runs two book clubs and her general motto is ""I will do one big event every day"". 

She is also very fortunate in that she has enough money not to have to worry about it, so while she is not totally loaded she is more than comfortable. 

She also spends money on nicknacks like you or I have hot dinners, so everything she wants she has and the majority of it is utter tat.

So here's my problem, what can I buy an old lady who has everything she wants/needs to remind her that I love her?

Things I have tried already (the list isn't exhaustive but just a few):
- books
- audiobooks (they make her fall asleep)
- painting stuff (as she is an artist)
- soft cushions
- a new radio
- nice soaps, etc (she isn't into them)
- chocolates

I am looking for an adequate present for my friends upcoming birthday. Having kind of a hard time to considerate her interests:

Her field of study is 'cultural anthropology' (which she enjoys a lot), she is really into scandinavia (speaks swedish and is currently learning norwegian), she is quite a soccer fan and prefers sparkling wine over other drinks (occasionally drinks beer too, though). She also likes to go out and hang out with us - her friends.

She is turning 23 and we live in Munich, Germany.

I would really like to come up with something that does not involve candles, books or something like a Starbucks gift card.

I thought of asking her out for dinner to make sure I get to know her better and avoiding these troubles at the next occasion, but that might also send a wrong message... (also not sure if I want to send that kind of message at all)

1355589144.0,10,self.santashelpers,14wcya,[Suggestion] A tablet-buying guide based on your price point ($90 - $550+),WhyAmINotStudying,10,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/14wcya/suggestion_a_tabletbuying_guide_based_on_your/,"I made a [list of items under $50](http://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/14fawl/suggestions_a_lot_of_practical_things_that_a_lot/) that seemed to help a bunch of people get gift ideas last week, so I figured I'd throw out a price-based buying guide for tablets. There are a skillion out there and I've chosen the ones I find to be 

TABLETS

[A STYLUS $5.99]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FFNL3W/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B006FFNL3W&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – There are 2 of them that also write in ink here. It’s very handy and easy to keep with your tablet. This is a must have for all tablet-holders.

[Coby Kyros 7-inch $89.99]( http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=snewzbuttonco-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B0075W8C4M) – Let me start by saying that I would avoid buying tablets in this price range. There’s not a lot going for anything at this price, but if this is the budget, this is the one I’d go for. You don’t get access to the Google Play store, so you’re really limited. 

Under $200, I’d stick with:

KINDLES

[Standard Kindle $69.00]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007HCCNJU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007HCCNJU&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – **NOT A TABLET** The battery life is astonishing, you can read in any lighting, and if you have Amazon Prime, you can ‘borrow’ a crapload of books for free. If the person you’re buying for would only want a kindle for reading, this one is the way to go. The paperwhite kindle is so close in price to the Kindle Fire that I’d just go with that one instead.

[Kindle Fire HD $199.00]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083PWAPW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0083PWAPW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – I bought my mother the original Kindle Fire last year and she adores it. She takes it everywhere. My mother is retired and takes herself, my father, and my grandmother to doctor’s appointments all of the time. The fact that you can do so much with it for such a low price makes this one my favorite Kindle. The one I bought my mother is still available for $40 less, but it doesn’t have a camera for skype and stuff, and it only has an 8GB hard drive. The extra $40 makes the Kindle HD worth it.

 More TABLETS

[Asus Google Nexus 7 $282.00]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009X3UW2G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B009X3UW2G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) -  Like the Kindle Fire, the Nexus 7 has a 7” screen, but it’s super-powered for its price.  For that matter, it’s really the best thing in small tablets. The only downside is that it’s a small tablet.

[Toshiba Excite $340.00](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007L5O3G4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007L5O3G4&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) - I actually own a Toshiba Thrive, which is basically last year's model of this tablet. I really love it. This version has miniUSB, miniHDMI, microSD inputs, and runs Ice Cream Sandwich. The only concern I have is that Toshiba is really slow with updating the operating system, so it may be a while before they put Jelly Bean on it. That said, it's a hell of a nice tablet and Toshiba does a great job with their construction.

[iPad starting at $465.00]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013FRNKG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0013FRNKG&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – There are a bunch of options and prices, but I really don’t know enough about them to make a worthy recommendation. I do know they are all extremely highly rated by users, including my dingus of a sister.

[Transformer Infinity $470.00](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008F4NL04/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B008F4NL04&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) - At the beginning of the semester, a few of my friends asked me for a recommendation for a tablet. This one is the tablet that has created the most envy. You can add [a keyboard dock](http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?lt1=_blank&amp;bc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;fc1=000000&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;t=snewzbuttonco-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as4&amp;m=amazon&amp;f=ifr&amp;ref=ss_til&amp;asins=B008FH1R0W) to it that adds 4.5 hours of battery, a USB port, an SD card reader, and... well, it's basically a notebook at that point. 

[Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 $549.99]( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007M506WS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B007M506WS&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=snewzbuttonco-20) – The Note is actually even more highly rated than the iPads, which is a tough distinction, since the Apple people all love reviewing and praising their overlords. The Note is basically the latest, greatest tablet on the market. If you’re buying anything above this price, you’re probably looking to get 4G connection and stuff like that.

Cheap and tons of fun.,OneTrueMae,8,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/14m106/suggestion_gloom_darkly_humorous_game_that_anyone/,"The goal of this surprisingly simple card game is to make your family (similar to a suite of cards) miserable, and your opponents the happiest guys on earth. You draw cards with events (good or bad or death), and you have to use storytelling to work these events in so they make a kind of sense. First to kill off their whole family ends the game, and you total up your misery. Most miserable family wins!

It's a really easy game to teach and play, and I've personally tested it with several groups of friends and family. The darkly sarcastic personalities took to it easily, the more conservative personalities had great fun after the first couple rounds and they got used to it, and it brought out the storyteller in everyone. Tons of laughter from all sides, and it's now the favorite thing to play on our friend group's Game Night (right up there with oft-dirty Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit, so when it even takes over the old-school-game crowd it's something special.).

Best of all, it only cost us like $11 at our local game shop.

They like looking at birds in their garden and obviously traveling and I think they send letters and post cards to more people than just me. They are kind of like aunt/uncle to me. The guy likes bubble baths and used to have a chocolate bar every day with tea. So I used to send them crazy and fancy chocolates every year but a year ago I got a polite note saying that they're trying to eat healthier for medical reasons. Not sure what their diet entails anymore, so that cuts back on stuff I can get them.

His interests are PC games, reading sci-fi/fantasy, and tinkering (mostly related to computers).  He also likes board games but I've bought him so many that I'm running out of ideas for good ones now.  I'm moderately flexible with the budget if necessary.

- For PC games, he's inevitably pre-ordered any games he's interested in
- For books, he has a Kindle and I'm getting pretty tapped out for books he might like that he hasn't read yet.
- For tinkering, he's already got a lot of nice, high end computer peripherals/hardware and while I'm borderling considering trying to upgrade his videocard, I'm kind of unfamiliar with the differences between the Geforce GTX 670, 680, and 690 (and they're pretty out of my budget!) making it hard to decide if that would really be worth it.

Past gifts have included:
- bathrobe (liked)
- Kindle (liked)
- new wallet (liked)
- metal dice (liked)
- USB flash drive (so-so)
- dice tower (didn't like)
- dwarven forge dungeon tiles (didn't like)
- James Bond collection (didn't like)
- Zelda Skyward Sword for the Wii (never even opened it)

Board games he liked: Lords of Waterdeep, Galaxy Trucker, Race for the Galaxy, 7 Wonders, Pandemic, Citadels, Witches Brew, Ticket to Ride
Board games he didn't like: Power Grid, Dominion, Battlestar Galactica, Arkham Horror, Munchkin, Fluxx, Agricola, The Resistance
So-so board games: Kill Dr. Lucky, Dungeon Lords, Summoner Wars, Carcassone, Revolution!, Smallworld

I would like to stick to the handmade/ homemade gift idea but need help getting inspired. Instead of telling you what all of my family members like, I guess it would be helpful to describe some of the things I'm decent at:

* drawing (usually rough sketching, really not any good at painting),
* web design
* photography
* print making. 


The past few years I've gifted a screen-printed t-shirt, some photographs I made of our grandparents and their home (a sweet place to many of the others since a lot of them grew up in these stomping grounds), a framed drawing of our grandparent's home, a booklet made of information from ancestory.com, bookmarks made to look like characters of different family members, a carved wooden replica of a Blue Ridge Parkway sign (a place we all love to visit near home), and even a video game based on the members of our family trying to get our grandparent's house for Christmas.

She also adores the Orange Ginger body scrub from bath &amp; body works. I usually get her a combination of the items I've mentioned. I want her to receive something unique, but I also want her to use and enjoy it.

My father is a very hard working man. He works outdoors in landscaping for ~12 hours a day Mon-Fri, and once he's home he usually lies down in pajamas and passes out. He likes comfortable, relatively loose clothing. His stuff looks good, but he chooses comfort before looks. He is a handyman, and can fix just about anything. He loves action movies. I have no idea what to get him.

My brother (21 in a month) is an awesome guy. We drink and work out together all the time. He's extremely fit, and even more particular on what clothing he will wear. I don't dare buy him anything clothing related, because we have different taste and he'd rather pick it himself. Last year I got him various ""drinking"" themed items, and they were much appreciated. We play disc golf together, so there is potential in getting some discs, but I'm not totally sold on that idea just yet. He occasionally games on the xbox, but it's limited to FIFA/Tiger Woods. We play Wii games when we have people over, and generally stick to wii sports and mario kart. He's expressed a good deal of interest in a PS3 with a Playstation Move (largely to play the disc golf game), and I'd love to get it for him, but that's quite out of my budget. I've already purchased pricey tickets to take him to see Kevin Hart for his birthday in early December, so I am definitely limited in what i can do. I want to get him something he'll cherish, obviously.

My sister is 18 years old, a new member of Kappa Delta at her college, and has an extremely high level of fashion sense. They awarded her with Fashionista this year, which is apparently a big deal. She's a sweetheart that does everything in her power to make people around her happy.  She takes after our mother in that she loves comfortable things when around the house, but that's always a ""safe-zone"" and has become pretty uninteresting. Her boyfriend is getting her into snowboarding this year, and they have already acquired most of the stuff. I think she still is in need of goggles and a jacket, so there is possibility there if I can combine forces with my brother.

I'm graduating from highschool this year and I need some ideas of what I can give my group of 8 friends.

I dont have time to do a scrapebook for every friend or make a food jar thing. Also I dont want to do the chessy thing were you print a picture and frame it. Im not crafty or artsy. Im unable to bake, cook or make anything homemade. I dont even have baking stuff. So I'm abosultly clueless on what to do a grad gift for my 8 friends.

I definetly would write a message in a card for all of them, though Im having trouble where I can find a nice card for all for them that isnt overly expensive

If it helps Im located in Burnaby, BC which is near the city Vancouver, Canada.

I want to buy something and make something but Im not arty to anything. So please give me some ideas. Im not sure what to buy or make. Im hoping to spend less than $50-70 on the highschool grad gift/trinkets total for all 8 friends. The gift doesnt need to be big or great but can be small and something sentimental and cute.

Thanks

EDIT 1: We are all girls and everyone except one is moving away from home to study next fall

EDIT 2: Im unable to to access a credit card to purchase stuff online but you can send links to give me ideas.

Long story short, my youngest sister is having a tough time believing in Santa this year. We love seeing the joy and the magic in her eyes when she talks about Santa and the North Pole...the reindeer.. everything. Basically, a little 'friend' of hers at school is talking about how Santa is stupid (this is a VERY young kid, she's just generally unpleasant.) and believing in him is stupid. My family doesn't want my baby sister to lose that magic...that belief. So we've written a letter from Santa in response to her Christmas letter. She didn't ask for anything. She just admitted that she was having trouble believing and that she wanted all of the orphans and homeless children of the world to have a wonderful Christmas. She wished for them to find homes and a family who loved them. (I have a VERY sweet, very selfless little sister. Trust me when I say she doesn't say things like this just at Christmastime to get more gifts. She is like this year round.)
Anyway, long story short... we don't want her to lose that innocence. She's sad for all of the families who lost their babies this week, and she's really been down since hearing about it... She needs this childhood magic very badly this year.
So I guess, my question is if you or someone you know looks like Santa Claus, could you take a picture of yourself holding a sign that says, ""Here is your proof, Arianna. Merry Christmas."" Or something similar? If not, could you photoshop something like that?
I'm not savvy with technology at ALL or I would do this myself. I'm also a 5'3 female who looks nothing like the big man in red, nor do I have any friends who could do this.
I can't go to the local mall santa because we live in a small area and she sees him all the time and knows he's 'one of Santa's helpers.'
Please help me make my little sister's Christmas magical.. at least for one more year.
Thank you and Merry Christmas

I have never bought any presents for anyone apart from for a now ex, hers was just a book and a necklace she really wanted. Basically this year instead of only buying ""big"" presents as a type of syndicate I'm going to buy them a little something each...

I have 3 brothers and two parents to buy for, something like £5 to £15 each ($10-$30)

1) Male, 15, Brother - He's into Dr Who, reading all sorts of books, computer games, star wars, lord of the rings...

2) Male, 23, Brother - He's into his sport, not playing but watching; specifically football (Arsenal), horse racing (possibly his favorite and knows soooooo much) he also enjoys other sports.

3) Male, 25, Brother - He loves his sports (doing them), does tae kwon doe, breakdancing, loves fishing, browsing reddit &amp; wimp lol.

4) Male, 50, Dad - He loves his football and horse racing just like the 23 year old, enjoys the tv show: Downton Abbey (i hate it!).

5) Female, 47, Mum - She likes to go shopping, she loves flowers, loves downton abbey like my dad, she enjoys reading and sucks at cooking lol.

She knows about that now, so the ""exciting outdoor adventure"" would no longer be a surprise, and we now have two of these kinds of day trips we might do later in the year.
She's from a VERY traditional arranged-marriage type of family, and cannot go anywhere that would involve being away over night. (They like me and I spend weeks at a time there, but they think I'm just a close friend. How they don't get it? I don't know.)
We live in Canada, and this year our relationship became long distance because my grad school is 500km away. I'll be spending the three weeks off of school with her. 


She loves movies, perfumes, really anything I give her, my cooking/baking, sentimental things, surprises, doing new and exciting things, and has a great sense of humour. 

Things I've already given her:

- all her favourite movies and tv shows, and then some

- diamond/silver/white gold/swarovski crystal jewellery. Jewellery hand made by myself. And of course her engagement ring.

- clothes (both purchased and designed/sewn by myself)

- underwear

- teddy bears and stuffed toys (both purchased and designed/sewn by myself)

- all kinds of cooking/baking/recipes

- flowers

- perfume

- books

- quality pillows and blankets (with ""I love you"" stitched into them in small lettering)

- sentimental personalized little items that chronologize our relationship. I had her go on a scavenger hunt for different gifts. I've written things for her. I've even made a scrapbook. (The more things like this I give, though, the harder it is for her to hide them at home). 
Last year I decorated my hotel room with roses and christmas lights, so it looked really special when we spent the day there.


More info on her (as requested):Like me she's a science student, and between school and her home obligations she doesn't have much free time for hobbies. She's really amazing at being there for her family, and likes to make her mom (who has a whole mess of health issues) happy. (So as a gift to my girlfriend I've gotten things for her mom too, like hand made diabetes-safe high quality chocolates) In all the time I've known her, she's never really wanted anything material except she was kind of keen on an iPad, but then her family got one. She's not very frivolous when it comes to having things. This year was the first time she ever said anything she wanted, because I've been begging her to tell me ANYTHING and she said ""a coat, good boots"", so I'll probably get her those, but it doesn't exactly have a wow factor unless I can add to it (like ice climbing would have). And I've never seen her happier than when I surprise her with ideas for things she wouldn't have expected. She's never been to a concert but I don't know if she'd really want to see one or not since most of the music she listens to is in Urdu, so she doesn't really have any touring favourites here. She's not that big on theatre productions or anything either, and though when I want to go with her she likes spending the time together, and for some things actually really really enjoys it, that would be more of a gift for me than to her. She likes when I learn to cook more things from her culture, which I've been working on a lot, and gets really excited when I pick up on new words in Urdu. I've been considering taking lessons in the language, but as I am living in French Canada right now, I have to brush up on my French before I pick up an entire third language! She has this silly thing for Dyson appliances but doesn't want me to get her any ( A. because they cost a ridiculous amount, B. because a vacuum or fan isn't exactly a nice gift and C. because she knows it's silly). She LOVES cartoons, especially avatar and looney tunes. (But I've gotten her the 'books' for avatar, and a bunch of looney tunes episodes). She also likes comedy shows (Friends, How I Met Your Mother) and crime shows (I've recently gotten her hooked on Sherlock, the only 'crime' show that I like). Except I have gotten her so many movies and TV series, and she isn't really into TV/Movie related merchandise.


Please help! ANY suggestions of something you haven't seen here and something to bring joy or surprise to someone's face (on their anniversary no less) are appreciated. THANK YOU!

So my sister graduated college last may and I wanted to make her an adulthood survival kit back then, but I was getting married two weeks later and moving across the country and it just didn't happen. So I'd like to do right by her for Christmas.

The idea is to get a standard red metal toolbox, 15""x6"" or so (StackOn makes nice ones that I use for tools) and fill it with items that would be great for a young woman just starting out in life as a real adult.

Despite having been a 'real adult' for several years now, I am having a terrible time coming up with ideas for what to put it in. I know I want the following:

Vice Grips (universally useful tool)  
'Hung over and I have to go to work' kit (aspirin, tea/coffee, etc)  
Small bottle of emergency liquor  

Those three things basically sum up my approach to adulthood, so you can see why I need help. I would like to fill the toolbox with items that serve a mixture of purposes: some just for fun, some genuinely useful, some things to think about or to inspire...but all oriented around being a post-college person. And the items need to be cheap on their own, because I need to keep the total cost to $100 or less....less would be better.

So lay it on me! What are your ideas?

She loves babies, wedding magazines/dresses/television shows, clothing and accessories, plays/ballets. She has a few tattoos; probably would want more, I'm guessing. 

Her father died quickly from cancer when she graduated high-school...her tattoos depict symbols and phrases which remind her of him. One year, I sketched a picture for her using a photograph of them together. (Not an artist, could not produce anything worthy). 

She is still living at home (from necessity: schooling and a cancer-battling widowed mother) but greatly desires escape in almost any form, which includes, primarily, travel/getaways.

A couple of things to watch out for:

1. Make sure you're buying an ORIGINAL autograph and not a preprinted or facsimile autograph. Ebay has categories for ""Original"" instead of ""Reprints"" but not everybody plays by the rules.
2. If possible, make sure your autograph comes with a COA (Certificate of Authenticity) that verifies that the autograph is legit.
3. While shopping, if something seems wrong, it probably is, so trust your gut! If you see that most Leonardo DiCaprio signed 8x10s are going for $125, the one that's selling for $30 probably has something wrong with it.

Get the photo, grab a frame ($1-$100 depending on how exquisite you want to go), and you've got a great gift. It's quite the moment for Mom to think ""Wow, Matthew McConaughey actually had this photo in his hands!""

Good luck, and MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!!!

She's a cute blonde bombshell, very much a girlie girl, and also an extremely bright med student.  Hardest worker I know, fun loving, likes the outdoors, partying, friends, food...  but spends most of her time studying.  Being a second year med-student is pretty much all-consuming... Honestly, most of her hobbies have to take a back seat for the next few years, so this is difficult.  Shopping, yoga, friends and thankfully her boyfriend are all she really had time for besides school right now.

And after all these birthdays and Christmas' I really feel like I've gotten her all the typical things, and I hate to repeat.  To recap for others looking for ideas I've bought her past years:

* Tech stuff: Headphones, speakers, digital photo frame (good gifts as most girls won't buy this stuff themselves)
* Clothing: New jacket, shirts (with the help of the girls at her favorite store), Toms, ect. 
* Jewellery: Earings, bracelet, the usual
* Home-made cards/Coupons/Date reservations

Her list thus far includes only an e-Reader which I doubt she'd use, and a couple of little things from Arizia.  I was thinking of perhaps doing a Chistmas stocking this year with all the little thing she wants/likes (lotion, Starbucks card, chocolate, an e-reader, fun stationary, a dvd or two, ect. ect.) 

It would be cute but hardly memorable.  So if you have any awesome 'big gift' ideas, please help me!

my mom is in her 50s and she has cancer so it's really important to me that I give her an awesome gift. I try really hard but she doesn't have any material things she really wants--she's not into clothing, jewelry, etc. She's a huge New England Patriots fan but already owns a ton of gear. 

Generally I think the sentimental gift route is better for her. Last year my siblings &amp; I pooled our money and got my parents a gift cert for a weekend away at a nice hotel, but my parents could never find the time to use it. They are super overloaded and stressed. I've thought about getting her a massage gift certificate but I don't know that she'd enjoy that.

I think the thing she'd like most is something meaningful coming from ME (if that makes sense), but I'm just at a loss as to what that could be. I've done photo albums/big photo frames with lots of pictures of the family in the past and she's loved that, but I can't do it again. What's something I can get her that just shows her I love her?

My budget is not super strict, but I guess $100 or less would be great. She lives in the midwest.

She likes movies like American Psycho, Harry Potter, Funny Games, Howl's Moving Castle, etc. She watches Dexter, Breaking Bad, and The Walking Dead in her spare time. She's REALLY into zombie lore–probably the only reason I find the idea interesting. She talks about zombies and brings up scenarios all the time. She often goes out of her way to be ironic and eccentric.

* **16 year-old half-sister:** She's extremely outgoing and girly. She's a cheerleader at her school. She's also Mormon (because of her mom), though she's not preachy at all about it. She's really into the band 'One Direction' right now–I think mostly to be ironic. She likes cute things. From memory, I think her favorite movies/television shows are: Mean Girls, ???

* **49 year-old stepdad:** He's extremely old-fashioned and also very athletic. He was on the track team through high school and he owns/operates a fitness program with my mom. He likes Dale Carnegie a lot. He gave me one of his books last year and told me that it changed his life when he was my age. He likes movies like A Perfect Storm, The Bourne Trilogy, Mission Impossible, 300, etc.

* **40 year-old mom:** She's very... motherly... and also very athletic. She likes to go trail-running with my step-dad for fun. She also does photography/web-design for the business that she owns/operates with my step-dad. She has a very ""do-it-yourself"" mentality about her artistic hobbies and she's very proud of that fact. She's a die-hard organic food eater. She's read the entire Hunger Games series and loved the movie. She really likes Breaking Bad.",,False,,t5_2vjt7,False,,,True,t3_153p9u,http://www.reddit.com/r/santashelpers/comments/153p9u/help_i_have_about_100_to_spend_for_gifts_this/,

No clue if they are still like that. 

I am able to see my sister's likes on facebook and it's typical teenage girl stuff - Justin Bieber, Hunger Games, iCarly - but she's also into sports, especially football and cross country. 

I don't have any contact with their parents (and therefore them) which is why I don't know anything about them. It also means that I won't ever know if they even receive the gifts if I mail them so I don't want to spend more than $75 total. 

Do you suggest that I try to get them a generic gift in the $25 range and hope they like it? Or send gift cards? Another idea was to send something small so they'd have something to unwrap and then also send gift cards but I'm not sure what to get. Last year I sent them DC sweatshirts (where I live) so I probably shouldn't get DC stuff again.

My Mum's 45th Birthday is coming up soon and would love some fresh ideas. Here is some info about her:

* She works as a caterer and makes lots of Indian food at home. 
* She does a lot of housework (we help of course!) 
* She recently started drinking green tea. I already bought her an infuser and she bought some sencha green tea along with a nice kettle. 
* She loves cooking traditional and western food and she has some cookbooks written in her native language. She cooks vegetarian food. 
* Jars, jugs, cutlery, kitchen stuff and ornaments are cool too. 
* She likes not too sweet chocolates (but not dark chocolate)
* She likes flowers and indoor plants (which I have previously gifted) 
* She loves natural beauty products 
* She has long-ish hair
* She likes watching Indian soap operas (a lot)
* She doesn't put too much make up on except lipstick and nail polish
* She obviously likes simple garments (sadly I cannot spend more than $50)
* She wants to exercise more from her home

So I've gifted plants, a hand made card written in her native language, good chocolate and tea. I've never given things like aprons, kitchen stuff, clothes, garments, beauty products, spa treatments etc (but I want to avoid the spa/massage treatment stuff since she already does them herself). 

So, I would love some ideas. I am open to beginner level crafts and have considered crocheting and quilting and sewing but don't know where to start. 

Thank you.

I'll give as much details as I can and from what I remember from when he was younger.

He's twelve years old, we're originally from Texas. He used to be really into Star Wars, action figures, and Cars.  He recently placed third in a spelling bee.  

When he was young he was always drawing and doodling things.  He has a Wii as well as a Nintendo DS. He likes Legos as well, but since they are so specific and usually involve a series I never know which ones to buy him. I think last year he liked Bionicles (is that what they're called?)  He also likes going out to the movies.

I don't think he's much of a reader.  He did read some of the Harry Potter books as well as the Hunger Games. 

I don't really want to get him anything remotely dangerous- no gun type things- because my 4-year-old sister lives with them. And I don't want him to shoot his eye out.

I gave him a Ben 10 toy that he really wanted a couple of years ago, but I'm sure he's outgrown that.

We've been long distance the entire time with kind of a rough past, and we're both in college struggling to get by and pay the bills.  He's from Kansas City, KS, but now goes to school in Phoenix, AZ (I go to school in Tucson, but live in Phoenix). We never really do ""presents"" for any holiday but I feel it's about time I step up my A-game.  The thing is, is that he is incredibly difficult to shop for, especially with a low budget around 50 dollars.  Not to mention that whenever he wants something, he gets it for himself.

He hates the stereotypical boyfriend stuff (watches, clothes, cologne, etc) so that's automatically out of the ballpark.

He loves everything about Japan and the culture.
His last name is ""fox"" and ironically finds foxes to be extremely intriguing.

He's 21 going to school for mechanical engineering.
He's an avid drifter and is in love with his '93 300zx.
He's working on a Toyota Corolla 86, which is his pride and joy, but dreams of one day having a Skyline.
He's been tinkering with cars and working as a mechanic for practically his whole life, but car parts are so damn expensive.

He also works at Starbucks, and is incredibly interested in coffee.  He views coffee as an art.  I was going to get him a pretty nifty French Press, but he just bought one for himself.

When he's not drifting or in class, he's playing Minecraft, Gary's Mod, or Forza.

Loves art in many forms.  He's a percussionist, great at the guitar, and can make anything sound beautiful.  He listens to all sorts of music, but his favorites are M83 and Death from Above 1979. He also  loves Neil Young, The Black Keys, City and Colour, Rush, Silversun Pickups, White Stripes, Alabama Shakes, etc. 

He's also very into photography.

He's the type of person that goes out and gets what he wants.  So he has pretty much everything he wants, which is the problem.  And if he doesn't have it, it's because he can't afford it or he hasn't found what he likes ""more"".

There are two pads which is just a strip of copper that acts as a resistor and get hot.. I'm sure you can make the heating pads yourself pretty easily but I Found these gloves because they had a switch that came with it.

Next step is to get the pads seperatley and buy the thing you want to be heated..( I originally used these as a pocket heater for my jacket in the winter..sewed the pads into the fabric lineing and had a battery pack in my pocket..  but I dont use that jacket anymore.

**Books or gift cards to book stores.** If you're going to buy a novel, then it really depends on the person. I'm a huge fan of *World War Z* by Max Brooks, *Life of Pi* by Yann Martel, and the entire *Hunger Games* series by Suzanne Collins (her *Gregor the Overlander* series is fantastic as well), and a lot of my friends really like the *Bitterblue* series by Kristin Cashore.

**Gift cards to clothing stores.** I would stay away from buying actual clothing unless you're sure about the style/size. Plus, the opportunity to shop for herself is part of the gift. Stores like [Forever21](http://www.forever21.com/Product/Main.aspx?br=f21) and [Urban Outfitters](http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/index.jsp) are good choices.

**Makeup.** *Most* girls like makeup; many are intimidated by it. It's confusing and expensive to gain makeup experience, so services like [Birch Box](http://www.birchbox.com/) (my favorite) or [Ipsy](http://www.ipsy.com/) make AMAZING gifts. 

**If she likes movies...** A friend of mine was given a huge plastic popcorn bucket (like [this](http://www.google.com/shopping/product/11591272046446759473?q=plastic%20popcorn%20bucket&amp;hl=en&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=db7cc828f0c7fb26&amp;bpcl=38626820&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;tch=1&amp;ech=1&amp;psi=MBOjUO2iDsiZyQGQkoDgCg.1352864601937.3&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MhOjUNCjKIW0ygHxtIC4Ag&amp;ved=0CFYQ8gIwAQ)) one year, brimming with movie stuff. Microwave popcorn, a couple of dvds, and a pair of fuzzy socks. She absolutely adored it.

**Lots of girls like homemade things.** Bath bombs, hand-knit scarves, etc. It shows you care, and we'd probably end up buying those things ourselves anyway. Also, baked goods or a hand-made card go a long way.

Idea: I wanted to buy her a drawing tablet so that we could draw each other pictures while we're apart. We already do this in small scale on our phones.

Why it failed: She sold her computer since she's moving to a new location. I don't have enough money to buy her another.

---

Idea: Flying lessons or a flight with the Blue Angels. Her dream is to be a pilot.

Why it failed: Despite being in the Navy, I don't have enough pull to arrange a flight. Also, scheduling conflicts. As for private lessons, again, I don't know when she'd be available to do it.

---

Idea: Zoo Keeper for a Day. She loves the zoo and was so jealous of the women that got to touch and play with the animals.

Why it failed: It is offered at a zoo down here, and she's over there. I'd love to fly her down to do this, but it would have to wait until after the Christmas season. Scheduling, again.

---

What I bought her last year: Navy themed Build-a-Bear and Kindle Fire. Went well.

---

Things I should stay away from: Jewelry. Due to uniform regulations, she wouldn't be able to wear it. Also, anything too large that would be difficult to store in limited space (on a ship). Also, clothing. She's an impossible size (small).

She likes classical music, british crime tv shows, victorian era decor and movies. She is crazy about small little knick knacks, like birds, china plates, little ceramic ducks, basic old woman collecting things. 

I'd really like to get her an MP3 player and preload it with her favorite music (she still uses CDs and a huge CD player) but a big concern is she has bad vision (which does not mesh well with the pattern of making everything smaller and sleeker), arthritis and just is not very tech savvy AT ALL.

I am quite aware that nuclear power plans are safe. And, yes, we experience continuous exposure to radiation. Please bear with me here while I try to put together a question here....

My nana is in her mid-70s and recently became concerned with all the news coming from the rumor mill being her bridge-domino-(not chess, but something similar to it) club. She believes that radiation from San Onofre is affecting arthritits in her neck with her neighbor corroborating the story by claiming that she knew someone who knew someone who lives down the hall and ended up with a acute glaucoma because of x-rays coming from the nuclear plant about 5 miles down the shore.
So, they managed to convince their RN to have somebody come over and measure their ""radiation"". To make a rather long story shorter, for the last 5 months, a ""consultant"" was charging her and other residents a heavily discounted rate of $500 a month to come over and ""survey for radiation exposure"" twice a month.
I want to buy her a ""Geiger counter"" that she can use and stop being fleeced. Something simple and easy to see, so that she would always have it and neither her nor her rumor mill collaborators will have to take advantage of the generous offer from this wonderful ""radiation consultant"".

Right away for the lilkes of me out there: I am not expecting or positioning myself to get one for free. I want to buy it, but without actually being able to see one in real life in front of me, I can't decide what are some of the simpler models out there that would be best suited for elder folks.

The hours are long, hectic and late (usually works from noon to early morning). Of course, she has to keep up a workplace appearance in the form of ironed shirts. Space around the house is frustrating because there is often a 3 year old nephew around. With the hours, she has little time to clean.

I feel that, as a man, a man can only get so excited about ""man"" gifts. Clothing, cologne, alcohol, hunting/fishing/sporting equipment, and tools can only go so far. Last year, I thought I would shake things up for my stepfather a bit and get him a $20 remote controlled miniature helicopter. He has been employed in aerospace technology-related fields for most of his life and it's a career he's sincerely enjoyed. I remember he had a miniature remote controlled [HIMARS](http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/himars12.jpg) when he and my mother first met and how he thoroughly loved to annoy his dogs with it. In my mind, it was a great gift and I counted the days until he could open it.

My little sister was furious when I told her what I got him after I had arrived at the house for the holidays. Absolutely livid. With her loud voice barely contained and her finger pointed at me, she swore that he would hate it and that I was an absolute fool for buying it. I don't know what exactly brought this pure spite on, but I believed her. I was fairly nervous during the days leading up to Christmas Day, to the point that I refused to tell my mom what I got for my stepfather. 

But Christmas Day eventually came, and as my stepdad unwrapped his gift, his eyes lit up. He pushed the rest of the standard gifts aside to play with his new toy for hours. A year later, I still come home every other month or so to my stepfather flying the little helicopter, chasing our boston terriers around. 

So it's a year later and I can't for the life of me figure out how I can top last Christmas' success. I'm still a broke college student, so about $20 is the best I can do. Any ideas, /r/santashelpers?

The brother-in-law is a doctor, he used to golf before the kids, but he doesn't anymore, he's obsessed with photographing the kids, but I have no idea if he's a Nikon or cannon guy, got him [this](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/e89a/?rkgid=275668648&amp;cpg=ogpla&amp;source=google_pla&amp;gclid=CJDQ15HJ0rMCFQY5nAodTg0A6Q) last year, it seemed to go over well, I remember when I was a kid (I'm 24, he's 50) that he played NES with me, he's mostly a recluse who doesn't like anyone or anything.

Anywho, I'm looking for ideas for my mother, father, and two brothers. Below are basic profiles for all of them. We're all fortunate to have good jobs and basically acquire anything we need on our own, so I typically stick to fairly quirky or silly gifts for ""the people who have everything"" so to speak. 

We all live in the Midwest in the United States. Budget-wise, I'd like to not exceed $100 per person with the exception of my mom. My two brothers and I typically pitch in together to get her something nice, so $200-$300 would be acceptable in her case.

Feel free to recommend a gift for any or all of them! Thanks in advance for the ideas!

---------------------------------
 *Mom:*

* Age: 58

* Career: Accountant in small family business

* Hobbies/Likes:


- **Cooking.** 

She refuses to buy kitchen gadgets for herself but is always blown away by how helpful newer appliances can be. I.e. she still had her old food processor she received as a wedding gift 36 years ago which barely worked, so one year we bought her a brand new Cuisinart machine and she uses it almost daily.

- **Reading** (she has a Kindle but loves printed copies as well)

She's a big fan of historical fiction (i.e. stories written during significant historical events from the perspective of a fictional character, or an alternate timeline of well-known historical figures). She also enjoys any kind of inspirational literature and classic literature.

- **Community service** 

No she's not a convict haha, but she's always volunteering at her local church, shelters, schools, etc.

- **Board Games** (she mercilessly thrashes all of us at Scrabble)

- **Traveling with friends**

When their schedules occasionally align, my mom loves getting together with some of her close friends to plan a weekend getaway to have some time to relax away from work, family, etc. 

---------------------------------
 *Dad:*

* Age: 58

* Career: Pharmacy (owns his own small business--a community retail pharmacy... that's where my mom also works as an accountant)

* Hobbies/Likes:


- **Planes** (has pilot's license, flies small plane-- Cessna 172-- for fun)

- **Cars** (all around handy man, has built old cars like Model Ts from the ground up)

- **Old Movies and TV shows**

His two favorite movies: ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Sargeant York""... which even I enjoy even though they are older films... Jimmy Stewart and Gary Cooper respectively. His favorite two old TV shows: ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Amos and Andy.""

---------------------------------
 *Younger Brother:*

* Age: 22

* Career: College student

* Hobbies/Like:


- **Gaming**

He and I both enjoy console games as well as both own gaming PCs and love playing online games together to keep in touch.

- **Bacon**

No seriously. Bacon. It's an obsession. 

- **Books**

Primarily scifi/fantasy. He currently has a Kindle that is linked to my Amazon account so he can enjoy all the books I own without having to blow his limited college budget on books of his own.

- **Food**

We're both very into cooking... primarily experimenting with seemingly crazy concoctions which sometimes turn out delicious and sometimes turn out terrifying. He's usually up for any kind of quirky restaurant or new food experience in general.

- **Music**

I'm honestly not sure of his specific tastes in music. I can tell you it is far removed from my own, so we typically don't listen to each others' music when we see each other. Sorry to give a generic description, but maybe there's still a music-related gift out there that will fit.

---------------------------------
 *Twin Brother: (nope, not identical)*

* Age: 28

* Career: Dentist (currently back in school working on periodontal degree)

* Hobbies/Likes:


This is where it gets tricky. We live in different states and really only get to see each other once a year or so on holidays. So while we have a great time together, I'm kind of out of touch with his day-to-day likes and dislikes. He lives in Dallas, TX if anyone has any suggestions for that area specifically.

- **Planes**

Like my dad, he has his pilot's license and enjoys flying small planes.

- **Drinking**

No, not an alcoholic. But he definitely enjoys spending several nights a week with friends at his favorite local bar for dinner and a few drinks to unwind at the end of the day.

- **Uhhhhhh**

He is so incredibly hard to shop for. And I know I'm not alone in feeling this way. For his birthday last year every single gift he got was cash. He usually makes a list, I asked him three times in two months and he can't come up with a single thing other  than that Slushy Magic thing on TV. &gt;.&gt;

The problem is, right now his main interest in video games. Mainly Minecraft and other things like it. This is a problem because he's never pleased  with any of the other games, and besides his Mother and stepdad and his Uncle always buy him the more expensive awesome things.

So.. here are some of his other small interests:

* Creating things (like inventing, engineering things)
* Science stuff. But not overboard with it, just slight interest.
* Adventure Time and other cartoons like it.
* Youtube videos of other people playing games.
* Recently taken a liking to pranking people. 
* Enjoys spy gear type things. 

That's all really, (sadly). He doesn't listen to music or read books. Last year his mom got him a netbook computer and he had it ate up  with viruses in no time from looking at porn. We got him a DS lite last year, he hasn't touched it in over six months. His favorite gift last year was a Minecraft t-shirt and won't wear it so it won't get ruined.

Edit: added a couple of interests.

I'd rather not give my stepson cash or  gift cards. His other three siblings will have many presents under the tree. We're spending  around 200 to 250 per child, so that's my budget.

My boyfriend is a big gamer. I swear if it was made he probably played it. He plays anything from shooters, to MMOs, to RPGs. He recently fell out of COD/Black OPS, but he loved Dragons Dogma/Oblivion and Morrowind(hated Skyrim)/Dragon Quest and Final Fantasys up to X. He right now is playing World of Tanks/League of Legends/Guild Wars 2. He uses Razer stuff and has the silent key Black Widow Keyboard and the Naga mouse. Table top wise, he has been wanting a game that you can play with two people can play together and actually have fun. This could be a card game, dice, whatever! I am not really a good judge of these things but I'm open to playing them! If anyone can recommend any games I guess that might work, maybe a computer accessory that would help him too! 

Also, he loves the Pittsburgh Penguins but I feel like clothing isn't a very fun gift. He's a guy---they need fun, not practical. Obviously his favorite player is the captain, Sydney Crosby. He's super bummed about the hockey freakout this year.

Now for books! He read the Redwall books and the Night Angel Trilogy and loved those too.

He has tended to like anime more recently than ever, and we have just started watching Bleach on Hulu! He loved Initial D and has most of the seasons but he hasn't touched them in a while. Also, we LOVE Lost. Hate Jack/Kate. Hurley/Locke kick ass. 

He has an R/C car also! It is a Rustler VXL but we live in a city where driving this thing can be tricky. It runs on a battery, not gas.

Here's a little description of each...

My Mom (F54) German/Canadian living in Texas.
She has a PHD in immunology so she is more on the intellectual side, loves to cook/bake. She recently got a job that is based out of California (Sacramento) and commuted from Galveston to there and then all around the world (China, Israel, Qatar, Germany). She is not overweight by any means, but her and her boyfriend try and exercise and eat healthy. She enjoys wine, a good move (Pride and Prejudice type stuff Walking Dead Dexter Game of thrones). I got her bath salts last year but it wasn't a terribly exciting gift, although she does love a good bath. She is also obsessed with TEA and drinks tea/coffe frequently. She reads a lot on flights and international flights usually have movies. She recently got into facebook and loves updating that with her adventures.

My girlfriend on the other hand is 21 and we have been dating for 3 years. She is fairly active, loves getting dressed up and going out with friends (we live in Austin), loves her cat, soccer, playing video games with me like rock band. I have gotten her nice earrings and a necklace, so the jewelry department is kind of done except for a ring, which I have been told is a bad idea unless marriage. All i have for her is I was planning on going to Mardi Gras in New Orleans and wanted to save money for that, but I don't know how to get her something that would relate to that without being underwhelming. My other thought is she has a really crappy phone (blackjack very old) and doesn't have pictures/social media etc, which girls these days seem to really like for taking pictures and loading them on FB or isntagram and generally documenting their excursions. She does have a camera, but lugging a phone and camera around seems outdated. I would love to get her an iphone, but her parents pay her phone bill and that would require an upgrade (she has basic phone unlimited text) so that idea is shot since you can't have an iphone without the data plan. Another idea was an adventure like skydiving, but that's pricey and I would have to get it for me as well and the bells and whistles like photographs etc.

I have amazon prime for students so I can get fast shipping for free if I order something online, but I'm really not hitting any homerun ideas which is depressing. Any ideas?!?!

*edit- $200 total, I would say $50 or around that for my mom and $150 for the girlfriend. But if an idea is great I don't mind spending more or less!

My father is an amazing person who has been given a raw deal in life. Without going into great detail, his wife passed about this time last year quite unexpectedly leaving him a single father (for the 2nd time in his life) with a 6 year old son. They live north of Baltimore, MD. I am currently living in Portland, OR while I attend grad school. Needless to say I am extraordinarily poor as a result of my extensive schooling. 

I am looking for some presents for both of them that will not leave me even poorer than I am now. A rough price would be $100 worth of gifts combined for the two of them. My father is a Ravens fan but otherwise has very few hobbies. He is a small business owner who runs his own trucking/paving/excavation company. Anything that could make his job easier or more enjoyable would be ideal. I am contemplating a round hitch lock since he got his equipment trailer stolen out of the driveway last week, but I am thinking it is probably too late for that to be helpful. The only other idea I have for him is a pair or two of smart-wool socks since he wears boots continuously. 

My brother is 6. He is very into construction stuff(he wants to be like Dad). He also thoroughly enjoys the outdoors, his hand-held nintendo whatever I got him last year for christmas, and the regular kids stuff. I considered getting him a BB-gun but upon consulting my Dad determined that he probably isn't quite ready for that.  

I am really at wits end with this one. I have 3 finals left, got my contracts final done today, and have very little time to buy gifts in person to send them so that they arrive in time. Thus, I will probably be relying on the internet mostly. 

In summary, my Dad and brother have been through so much in the last year and they have very little close family left in the area so I want to get something epic for each one of them. I know my Dad will probably not get anything from anyone besides me so I want it to be worthwhile.

For some background, he is a lawyer and he specializes in Native American law.  He was born and raised in Detroit, then lived many places after college, and ended up settling back in Northern Michigan.  He recently moved the last year to Oklahoma because my Stepmom got a job there.  And he is getting near retirement.  He has his own practice still in Michigan that he is trying to wind down, and looking for some small work in OK.  

He loves to sail.  He has a boat in Michigan, about a 30' I think.  He is trying to sell his house in Michigan, with the potential plan of living on the boat during the summer.  So for a gift I was thinking possibly something for the boat, but I'm not sure what. He likes gadgets, but he isn't very good with them.  He has a droid RAZR and uses the basic functionality of it.  He has talked about a tablet, though I'm not sure he'd really use it.  Still he likes to have the latest toys.  He did have an original Droid 1, and had a car GPS when they started making them, etc.

Other interests, he likes architecture a lot.  His favorite architects would probably be Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller.  Also he loves Mel Brooks. I think he has seen every movie probably a dozen times.  And along with that, he likes Jazz/Blues a lot.  I know he likes Taj Mahala ton.  And then he loves to cook.  But I feel like they have just about every cooking gadget, so I'm not sure if there is much room for gifts there.  Maybe a cook book or something along those lines?

Also, my Dad likes basketball.  Since moving to Oklahoma, he and my Stepmom have started cheering for the Oklahoma City Thunder.  They don't live to far away from OKC, so they have gone to several games there.  And he is also a Pistons fan being from Detroit.  But I would say they try to watch most Thunder games, and it is just about the only thing they watch on TV.  He also loves cars, as most boys who grew up in Detroit do.  I think his first car was a used 57 Chevy, or something close to that.  Last year I got him a model car with some paint, that we put together.  We used to do that when I was a kid, but I have sense grown up finished college and just started working at a real job.  I was thinking it might be cool to do another model, but I have to admit the one I got seemed like a lot of work trying to paint it and glue everything properly.

Sorry for the long post, but I just wanted to throw out everything that he is into if anyone has any brilliant ideas.  The budget is fairly flexible.  I just started working a real job and since I don't have any responsibilities I can splurge for a nice gift since I haven't been able to get him much before as a broke college student.

**Best friend, F, 24:** From Montana, loves country music and cowboys, whiskey with water, wine, Friends (she already has the 10 season set), loves loves LOVES the Lakers &amp; Kobe Bryant, reading, the movies Stepbrothers and What About Bob?, hot yoga, running, being charitable to homeless people, she's in public relations and crisis communication.

**Sister, 25:** Lives in Germany with her German boyfriend. Likes things that she misses over there, like manicures and getting her hair done. Likes purple, being practical. She's in public health, very educated but is having to work a crappy job right now. Likes culture, traveling (not just in Europe, but anywhere in the world). We are extremely close, but we've already gotten sister stuff and that kind of thing. She used to be kind of a hippie in college.

He likes the bonus features on movies more than actually watching the movies and his tastes range pretty dramatically. He likes a lot of 70's and 80's stuff but does recent stuff too. Lots of slasher films but also likes a lot of other things including MST3K or Smokey &amp; the Bandit, etc. He pretty much buys whatever he wants when it comes out.

He also likes discovering new music and will go pick out discount cd's based on who produced the album because he likes other stuff that producer has done. Musical tastes vary wildly also, Springsteen, Dwight Yokum, Evenecence, Glee (songs from the show), hairbands, Miranda Lambert, Clay Akien - you get the picture. 

Used to read a lot of Movie Watchdog magazines, likes to read books with snippits about movies and/or music. (Recently bought ""I Want My MTV"") No heavy reading, ""short story"" or articles are best.

Novelty gifts are a good idea. Themes I'd like to stick to would be MST3K, Halloween (Carpenters movie), Spiderman - but other vintage slasher movie stuff (tshirts etc) are good. 

If you know of some good headphones ([large over ear kind preferred](http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/13/132154/2338360-sony-headphones.jpg)) I may end up getting him a pair of those also. 

Budget can vary. I'd like to keep it under $50 but can go up to $100 for right gift.

Dad

* Really likes reading, in the usual spy thriller genre (think Jack Reacher). We saw Argo and he really liked it, but I don't know any other books about Iran and the hostage crisis other than On Wings of Eagles, which he's read already.

* Travels a lot for business, mostly in the US but frequently all over the world
- Kind of a beer snob, enjoys IPAs
- A self-proclaimed luddite and technologically illiterate, though he does like gadgets that ""just work""

Mom

* Avid gym-goer

* Likes convenience and time-saving gadgets, particularly in the kitchen

* Gigantic Anglophile, loves all things about Britain

* Owns and loves her iPad (ebooks and app ideas would work)

Sister

* Majoring in fashion merchandising in university

* Goes to school in a cold climate, probably not fully prepared for it

* Like clothes and fashion (obviously) and cute things

I have asked him numerous times for ideas for both of them and every time he shrugs his shoulders.  He says he's never been good about choosing gifts for people.  This is what I can say about them, and about his past presents:

DAD: His' in his mid to late 40's and is self employed as a radio/commercial voice.  He records commercials on TV, does the slogans for radio stations up and down the East Coast, and used to host a radio station locally.  He loves music, and he plays Guitar and perhaps Piano.  He's into classical rock, oldies, some alternative, and is very open minded and exploratory about any genre.  He also likes moving around and doing things (not necessarily handy-man though).  I have no idea what the BF got him in the past.

MOM:  She's in her mid/late 40's, and works with the dad in his business at home.  She loves the beach and has a beach house about 7 hours away.  BF often gets her something for the house, but the house is fully decorated and at this point anything else will definitely be clutter.  She's the one I'm at a loss for.  I don't know about many of her hobbies.  I know she volunteered for the polls on election day, and she gets out in the community every now and then to do different things.  She loves reading.

SISTER:  She will hopefully be an easy one... She's a teenager in her last year of highschool, and as a girl, I should be able to figure her out.  BF is probably the most clueless about her (of course).  She plays the alto sax, and she plans to continue it in college, which she will be attending locally.  She does wear makeup, and she likes clothes shopping, but she's usually in sweat pants and a hoodie with her hair pulled back.  She got her license last summer, but she doesn't have a dedicated car to her name yet, I believe.

First of all, this is for a Secret Santa gift exchange next weekend, so time isn't that big of a deal. I should still be able to order online. 

He's a structural engineer, loves football (Hokes and Cowboys), has a foosball table, plays videos games (FIFA, Halo, etc). 

I was thinking of getting him some sort of 3D puzzle (I'm familiar with Puzz3D but not other brands) that he could maybe keep on his desk or in his office, or maybe something cool he can build that either ends up becoming a toy or some sort of view piece. I originally thought of Legos obviously, but they are crazy expensive for something cool, or at least out of my price range. Saw at Toys R Us another brand called Mega Bloks that actually get good reviews and had Halo related toys. 

If anyone has any other input, it'd be a huge help. I'm wondering if there is something better he can put together then become like a remote control car or something. Chances are my price range is gonna limit me there.
