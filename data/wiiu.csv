Starting to see some backlash from members regarding the recent surge of ""I just bought a Wii U"" threads -

For those of you who think it is merely karma whoring - please consider that these are new customers who are proud of their decision - and perhaps looking to fit in with this community. One of the best parts of this community is the fact that we're not the Call of Duty worshiping people that are very common elsewhere. 

Yes, we have been seeing a lot of it. But that is a very, very good thing. I think we all fear the possibility that the Wii U would somehow end up being Nintendo's version of the Dreamcast. We should be very happy to see new fans. Especially ones that cut their ties to Microsoft on account of their future plans - that is not an easy thing to do. What Microsoft did was very anti-consumer, and it is a nice thing to see customers speaking with their wallets. 

Wii U news generally trickles out pretty slowly from Nintendo, so given that this is the quiet after E3 - I think that these people deserve a warm welcome. 

If you are a new person, I think you will find most people here are pretty friendly.

But mostly, it showed me that people were open to the idea of a Minecraft port on the Wii U. 

As of now, Mojang has an exclusive deal with Microsoft that will end at an unknown date and have made comments about a Playstation version in the future.

I created a petition site to let Mojang know that there are people out there that would support a Wii U edition of Minecraft. If you enjoy Minecraft and like the idea of it on the Wii U, check out this site and sign it today:

http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/

Download and install HFS on your computer, go to 'menu' and 'add files' and add a video file (mp4s are all ive tested but they work great).

Then near the top it should show your computers local IP address, for example mine is ""192.168.1.149:8080"". Go to the web browser on your Wii u and go to the address of your computer, and it should pull up the HFS browser right away, with any videos you've added. The videos play VERY well for me, and I'm still figuring out what all you can do with it. so far MP3s do not work, but pictures do.

Took me less than 2 minutes to set up, and videos are working great! :)

...and I may have went a little overboard...

http://imgur.com/a/oaG1B

So far, I've made:

* 4x SNES controllers (two went to a friend as gifts)
* 3x N64 controllers (still need to make one more, so i'll have 4)
* 1x Genesis controller

I actually originally wanted to do this to have N64 controllers that would work with N64 Virtual Console games. Games like Mario Kart 64, Mario Party, and Pokemon Snap just aren't the same without a real N64 controller. Then I, of course, had to make more than one so that I could get friends to come over and play, as well. After that, I decided to make a few SNES controllers, then a Genesis controller because... why not?

The whole project took me about a month to finish. Essentially, it's a microcontroller that sits in between and talks to the N64/SNES/Genesis controller, translates what it says into ""Wiimote-speak"", then sends it out to the Wiimote. The challenge was figuring out how to properly talk to a Wiimote and emulate a Classic Controller. All in all, I'm extremely happy with how it turned out!

**Edit:** Turns out there's some interest in me putting together a kit or letting people mail me their controllers to mod them! I put together a quick form on Google Docs to help gauge the interest. If you're interested, fill it out. If there's enough interest, I'm more than willing to put something together for everyone! :) 

*Form removed. Read edit 3!*

**Edit 2:** Wow. There's a lot more interest than I anticipated! When it comes time to actually putting together and sending out the kits, I may have to cut it off at 100 kits for the first batch. Being a recent college grad that's slowly getting murdered by student loans, that's all I can afford up front right now. Looks like I better start preparing things! It'll probably be a few weeks before things are ready to go. I'll start another post then and we can sort out ordering. It's probably most fair to let the people who filled out the form above get first dibs. In the meantime, keep filling out the form for anyone still interested.

**Edit 3:** I hate to say it, but I had to take the form down for now. There have already been over 30 people sign up. Since I can only do ~100 kits for the first batch, I don't want things to get too crazy. I'm hoping that I can accomodate everyone that's signed up so far. Like I said, when the time comes, people that have signed up will get first dibs. Anything that's left will be up for grabs by anyone. Thanks everyone!!!

I get up there, and of course they ask ""You know this is for Wii U right?"" And I of course say ""Yes.""  The guy then says to his work buddy, ""I found the one guy with a Wii U."" And they shared a douchey high five. I ignored it and carried on with purchasing the game and drove home.

I get home and the game doesn't work.

The next day I return to the same exact GameStop and tell them there is a problem. Same guy helps me.
""Are you sure your console isn't an original Wii model?""
I said that I was 100 percent sure.
""Well that's what happens when you get a crappy console at launch buddy.""
I ignored it thinking that this would be what I would get out of Gamestop employees. I asked about my options.
He said I could either go to the other local Gamestop, exchange for a different Wii U game, or get in store credit. I asked why I couldn't just exchange it for a different copy there.
""Well we only carry one copy of each Wii U game since nobody ever buys them.""
I was wondering if he was being serious and asked if I could get Monster Hunter instead. He said that's the only game anyone had bought in a while. So I was out of luck.
I told him to call the other gamestop and ask them to hold it. He tried to deny doing it by saying ""Don't worry, nobody is going to buy it"" while laughing.

He finally called and told them to hold it. When I walked out he started screaming ""WIIU WIIU WIIU"" like an alarm or something. 

I went to the other gamestop and got things settled quick, no comments. 

I'm speaking with the manager of the other store tomorrow. I'm not gonna deal with smart a$$ remarks while trying to simply return a game.

I don't like the word ""fanboy"", but I guess I'd be pretty close. I've owned every Nintendo console ever (including Famicon Disk, 64DD, and Virtual Boy (twice!)), and have probably played close to every 1st Party Nintendo title there's been. I loved all the WarioWare games, so went into this game trepidatiously hopeful. The videos didn't look great, but I was sure there would be more to it than we were being shown. I was wrong. 

I live in Japan and bought Game &amp; Wario the day it came out here, March 28, and saw the end credits two hours after I got it home. It is one of the most carelessly made 1st party Nintendo games I've ever played. I'd call it a tech demo, but the graphics aren't good enough to be demoing anything. It is not a party game since there are only four multi-player games (none of which are the least bit enjoyable, even the very first time you try them). 

This game is lifeless, un-fun, and honestly, truly, without exaggeration, none of the twelve mini games will hold your attention for more than a single play. You could download 12 similar, free, iOS or Android games and probably have a better time. 

I'm posting this because I saw a recent thread saying that this will ""only"" be $40 when it comes out in the States, but it is not worth NEARLY that much. If this were a $5 download, I'd say it might amuse you for a quick evening. 

Only to state my case for how strongly you need to vote against this game with your non-dollars, I would go so far as to say that the new SimCity would be a better use of money. At least there you get about 10 hours worth of something to do before you realize what a mess it is. Here the mess is evident immediately. 

I know that as Wii U gamers we are wandering a desert of gamelessness begging for a drink, but Game &amp; Wario is saltwater. ",,False,self,t5_2sjnz,False,,,True,t3_1byyz9,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1byyz9/psa_game_wario_is_absolutely_awful/,

This really isn't a public service announcement or anything, just something I experienced and wanted to let more people know about it.

My battery died in my gamepad one night when I left it on, and it would not turn on nor charge. The WiiU would still turn on, but the gamepad would not respond to anything. Turns out that the battery went too low and it needed to be reset. 

To do this make sure you only use a 00 Phillips head screw driver. I almost stripped them trying with a similar size. The battery can then be removed and put back in. It will finally let you charge it and turn it on.  I wanted to post this because on many of the forums people said nothing could fix this and Nintendo would have to do it. This is not true it is simple and easy, just make sure you have the right tools.

1373209393.0,169,self.wiiu,1hsy91,Objective discussion of the faults/complaints of the Wii U. I think it would be pertinent to have one big thread about this stuff.,janitar1,224,55,196,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1hsy91/objective_discussion_of_the_faultscomplaints_of/,"I feel there are a lot of people here who sometimes do not get to voice their (hopefully objective) opinions on here as often as they like. I see a lot of complaints about the Wii U, that both get upvoted and downvoted. But I think we should have a sort of ""Clear the air"" thread where we discuss the major faults of the Wii U so far. It's been 8 months(?) since its release and I'd like to take a look at what has been botched and what needs improvement with the system. Feel free to post whatever you like, but I would like to see the comments stay as objective as possible. 

EDIT. Complaints/grievances that have been listed so far:

* accounts tied to sytem, along with any eShop purchases

* Slow loading times in menu, app switching, and app loading.

* inconsistent performance of certain apps such as Netflix

* Somewhat very small library of games for having been out for 8 months

* Trickling Virtual Console releases

* Not much 3rd party support

* Lack of ability to use 2+ gamepads

* Lack of ability to play DVDs/Blurays (I know the reasons why it still sucks)

* Somewhat weak hardware comparative to previous generation

* Too many game delays

* Digital triggers on gamepad

* Lack of console identity in the market

* region locking

* No games seems to be completely Enhanced by the GamePad save 1. Makes me feel like I wasted my money

* The Wii mode is treated seperate. So its not like we can feel a hybrid of Wii games on the Wii U. (manly talking using the Gamepad as a classic controller and having off TV play for Wii Games.)

* Lack of advertising

* Talk too much about Nintendo Staples (mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong)

* Lacking an epic story driven RPG (maybe I'm missing one?)
* A kindle app for the gamepad seems overly logical
* A few people have mentioned the lack of a music streaming app of any kind
* Too many controllers (Part problem for cost/storage, part awesome for the opportunities of many play styles)
* The ability to watch Netflix and play a game on gamepad would be awesome but I'm not sure if this is feasible

* Freezing is a big problem. Os seems unstable and crashes sometimes. 

* No cross-game chat 
* No ability to send invites to a game lobby to other players
* Lack of sports games (not necessarily Nintendo's fault)
* The main menu sucks. Unlike the Wii, where every channel had cool animation and a tune, this one have nothing. It is even worse compared to the 3DS. The other screen is worthless, you can't even customize to show YOUR games (or the communities that you are interested).

* *More* apps in general. PS3 has all sorts of cool apps like Crunchy Roll. I know the people at Crunchy Roll are working on a Wii U app currently but I'm just using that as an example. 

* More use of the in pad mic would be good too. I've only seen it work with MH3 Don't know if it works with CoD or any other online game.

* No ""enter"" button on the Internet Browser Keyboard, so you can't search sites like Reddit that don't have a search button.

* Issues with the wireless gamepad connectivity. 

* Cost of VC titles is astronomical

* Want new IPs. Or at least innovation on old IPs, not sequels (Pikmin, DK, Mario 3D, Mario Kart). Mario Galaxy was a great example of turning an old formula on its head. Nothing like that even hinted at for the future.

* Lackluster launch titles compared to previous Nintendo generations

So I decided the only way to stop this DRM crap is to vote with your wallet.

Buy a Wii U and do not get to hung up on other games that are only going to be on Xbox One and maybe PS4.

Buy PC games from http://www.gog.com/ no DRM.

If a game comes out even on Xbox 360 and PS3 and Wii U and the Wii U does not get the DLC I'm still buying the Wii U version. No need to give Microsoft anymore of my money. Batman: Arkham Origins I'm getting the Wii U version.

Collecting retro games might be a new hobby so that opens up even more games you did not play.

Indie games are really big right now and this is a good sub reddit to check out and talk to this developers and tell them what you want more Wii U games please.

You can find great deals on indie games with these two links

I have not made up my mind on the PS4, but we do know Sony is not putting DRM on their game to block what you want to do with the disc, but I'm holding off on the PS4 until I get more information on the PS4.

My next console to my list will be

I'm an indie RPG developer and I'm been pretty out of touch with the console community for a while. We've recently started making moves toward the console space and are looking into what our options are.

What I'm wondering is how much interest there is for RPGs on the WiiU. After the success of Xenoblade and the announcement of ""X,"" I know interest has been rekindled, but I don't know to what extent.

The reason I'm asking is because we're a very small team with very limited resources. Developing a console game for a team of our size is doable but an incredible effort of time and money, so if we were to commit our resources to developing a game for the WiiU and it didn't break even, that would probably be it for us. On the PC and mobile space, it's easy for us to recover from a mistake or two, but there are unique challenges to developing for a console that change the playing field a little.

This isn't a stealth advertising topic, this is me coming to you guys for help and advice. I'm being open with you and hope you'll be willing to have a discussion with me.

These girls usually get the latest and greatest stuff that's out there (separate story but nonetheless, good for the economy) and they still had the Wii. 

I asked them ""when are you going to get the Wii U?"" All four of them, including the mother, responded with ""What's the Wii U?""

This made me incredibly sad. I tried explaining to them about the gamepad controller and how it's the next generation console but I just received blank stares.

For the past few weeks I've been building a WiiU streaming server (since the WiiU doesn't support DLNA ect) you can download it at: [http://vidiiustreamer.com](http://vidiiustreamer.com)

It's very much in Beta at the moment, but I've found myself using it a lot.

Currently it plays almost all .mp4s perfectly, Transcoding (turning other videos into .mp4s before sending them to the WiiU is planned for the proper release - I just couldn't quite get it working for the Beta). Video files that the WiiU probably won't play will turn up red in the interface of the browser.

Currently there's some pretty major...peculiarities, but it checks for updates every time it's launched so hopefully I can roll out a better version fairly soon.

Anyway, give it a shot if you fancy (the source code is also linked on the page at [http://vidiiustreamer.com](http://vidiiustreamer.com) if you want to have a look or run it on linux) and if you run into any problems I haven't mentioned either here or in the READMEs included then give me a shout.

Hope it's useful for you, Thanks. :)

1367555404.0,145,self.wiiu,1dlni8,So I took my WiiU home from college....,nickjacksonD,186,41,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1dlni8/so_i_took_my_wiiu_home_from_college/,"...As I had done during Thanksgiving break and Christmas break, and like before I caught glimpse of the amazing vision Nintendo has with this console. 

Going back to thanksgiving, I remember playing Sonic Racing with my family, as we all love the Mario Kart series, and my parents had a blast, even my sister (who is a sore loser) was enjoying herself.  But what made this different?  Well the gamepad is cool but that comes later.  The first bit comes from Nintendo having an online console, and my best friend who also had his WiiU home for the break.  I called him up, we video chatted, and then our moms video chatted (they're old friends) and they were blown away how cool this was(not tech-y people).  Then we proceeded to play *online* with this family, when neither my parents or his parents had ever played a game online before.

This is what hit me.  The way the Wii brought families together for casual gaming with motion controls, the WiiU is bringing next generation functionality as well as core gaming concepts to less experienced gamers.  I want to stress again that my parents are the **last** people you would expect to play a game online.  They are effectively bridging the gap they created bringing these new players into gaming.  Because I can play my hardcore games on the gamepad while hanging out with my family, and through their inquiry of what I am doing, I throw the game on the TV, we all play and it is an absolute blast.  

The same thing happened just last week.  I have Kirby on my VC, and I was playing it while my dad watched TV.  This game was the first game him and I ever played.  I remember being 3 or so and him bringing the NES home with a few games, this being one of them, and really truly bonding with my dad trying to beat this game.  It was hard(when I was a kid). So on a commercial I handed it to him, and he played it for a minute, said ""I'm not as good as I used to be"" proceeded to get a 1-up on the end level screen, turn the TV to the WiiU and play for the next 40 minutes.

Afterward, my mom tried out the Panorama view and was floored.  She kept talking about it and told my dad to try it (Kyoto Japan isn't really his thing haha).  But the look on her face, when she rarely tries new technology, but just *got* this reflects, I think, what Nintendo has tried to do all along, which is **get people to play** be it games or experiences or whatever. Simple as that. 

Now we here are worried about this or that, but I am continually reminded that Nintendo's heart is in this. So while I may have listed casual player examples, I feel that this sentiment repeats for the ""core"" audience, which Nintendo have said they are focused on, and I agree.  I mean, I've never played a CoD game, AC game, or NFS game on a Nintendo console before but I have now.  Once this console penetrates the broad market as well as the hardcore games I truly feel it will sit among the successful consoles of next generation(hopefully with the next gen offerings of the other companies, as I support *gaming* in general, and want it to succeed on all levels.)


tl;dr My parents got into this console, got brought into the 21st century without knowing, bringing core gamers and casuals together, everything will be ok because Nintendo is dedicated to their fans as shown by this vision of the WiiU

So sorry, long piece but I wanted to share my feelings on the topic.  Please feel free to share similar experiences you have had showing the WiiU off to people, as it has *always* been a positive experience for me.

It's my fifth Wii U title, after Nintendoland, NSMBU, Scribblenauts, and Sonic&amp;ASRT. I figured it was time for something new as I'm at something like 93% completion Sonic, NSMBU is wrapped up with the exception of a handful of star coins, and Nintendoland is the sort of game I'll come back to in short bursts.

I wasn't expecting much, as I'm not a big fan of shooters or zombie games in general, but it came recommended from a few online friends, so I figured I'd sooner give it my cash instead of a multiplatform game like Assassin's Creed 3 or Batman.

Turns out that ZombiU leans more towards something like Metroid Prime or an old-school dungeon crawler than anything else. You get dropped into an environment that's absolutely dripping in atmosphere with few supplies and are given a destination and objective. It's up to you to make it there and back in one piece.

Since you're left with so few supplies you have to scavenge the environment for whatever you can find. Luckily you're given an in-game analogue of the gamepad controller, which works 1:1 in a Metroid Prime-esque scanning mode. The moment you walk into a room you can pull up the scanner, make a full rotation around the room, and tag off any items for pickup, corpses to loot, or any other items to loot. (Lockers, chests, etc.) 

Ammo is, of course, scarce, since this fits squarely into the ""survival horror"" genre of videogames. You'll be relying on your trusty cricket bat for the majority of your in-game defense, and this increases your stress, since you'll have to get so close to the zombies to attack them.

Your inventory is handled on the gamepad screen, as expected, but the game doesn't pause when you start shuffling through your backpack, leaving you open for attack while you're trying to dig out a different weapon or health item.

Overall, highly recommended. If you don't like slow-paced games, you may not enjoy it, but as a game designed for the ground-up with the Wii U in mind, it really shows what the hardware is capable of.

They picked up pretty fast and they were pretty knowledgeable in their subjects.

Comparison

EA Wait Time: 1 1/2 hours

Nintendo Wait Time: 3 minutes

EA Talk Time: 1 hour

Nintendo Talk Time: 8 minutes


Here's my story of what happened. Basically, when I got my Wii U on day one I had it shipped to my house. When I opened it, the cables were in a bad condition and the case was all scratched. I called Nintendo and they sent a repair for me. I sent it in thinking it would be quick and easy.

Edit: This part above was a little condensed. I actually owned my Wii U for a couple weeks and had my Wii stuff transferred. It wasn't until my father told me to send it in and that it wasn't in an acceptable condition that I called Nintendo.

Well, it was quick but I found out something. They gave me a brand new Wii U without my saves on it. When I noticed this, I called them asking about my saves. I know I know, I should have backed up all my Wii transferred content on a SD card. I didn't think I would get it wiped for a scratch. 

They said that they still have it and they would tell me when they could find it. Weeks later, they call back saying it couldn't be done. I understood this and I was about to hang up when they said I would get free eShop credit and a free Wii U game for my troubles.

...FREE stuff for having troubles? Hell, most customer supports just say ""well I can't do anything about that soz"" and hang up. They said that I could have any Nintendo Wii U title. Pikmin 3 wasn't out yet (about 8 months ago) and I asked for that. They said they would make a note on my account saying I would get the game.

And that's when my call today happened. It took me less than 10 minutes to call them, get an answer, forward to admin department, and have my copy of Pikmin 3 get ready to ship for me. 



AND this is why I love Nintendo.

Edit: Allow me to expand. I was an early cheerleader for the WiiU, but have become very disappointed with it lately, as I think many people have. But I thought, no matter what, at least I'd be able to get all those great old NES and SNES games for it. Setting aside what in my opinion is a very lacklustre first wave of VC games, I think $8 for 20 year old SNES games is just exorbitant. These are games that have recouped their costs years ago, and have already been released on SNES, Gameboy Advance, and Wii VC. 

I think a far better option would be to sell SNES game at $5 or less, which would result in more people buying them. Nintendo would still make money, and they'd have more happy customers. NES games should be .99 to $3 as most of them offer less of an experience than a iOS game, many of which are free.

It's true that I couldn't buy the cartridge for $8, but that doesn't mean I have to like that price point for a digital file download. Cartridges are rare, in that they aren't made anymore. VC is a file with unlimited copies available.

Although there are some games I would see as being worth $8, such as Earthbound, Secret of Mana, maybe even FF3. But the current crop of NES games is not worth $5, and I don't believe the current crop of SNES games is worth $8. You may disagree, but for me it's just one more disappointment with this system, one which Nintendo could have easily avoided.

The current state of the 3DS VC also doesn't give me hope that the WiiU VC will be any good any time soon. But at least it has it's own great games to play.",,False,self,t5_2sjnz,1367423299.0,,,True,t3_1dg4ne,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1dg4ne/799_is_too_much_to_ask_for_super_mario_world/,

Here is that page: http://www.nintendo.com/wiiu/built-in-software/browser-specs/extended-functionality/

On that page are specialized commands for getting input from the GamePad.

They also have a test page for you to see how it is possible to get the various sensors and joystick inputs through JavaScript.

Open this on the Wii U: http://www.nintendo.com/wiiu/built-in-software/browser-specs/sample

Japanese version in case people want to see the source code: http://www.nintendo.co.jp/wiiu/hardware/features/internetbrowser/sample.html

Hopefully someone can make good use of these and make some games using the gyros and angle sensors.

__________________________________________

As suggested by a user here on the subreddit (thanks /u/edkisin), I decide to dig up a nice Reddit gem to use for this occasion - it's an IRC platform for Reddit called [Seddit](http://www.seddit.com) (no, it's not that seduction subreddit) which gives subreddits their own IRC, and allows for people to chat with each other. This uses your Reddit account as a log-in.

Also, moderators of the subreddit will have extended privileges as it is their chatroom.

Furthermore, you can also join multiple rooms at the same time - /r/Nintendo is looking to use this as well, so if you wish to co-mingle with them, then just click ""join another room"" and type in ""Nintendo"".
Of course, this is all a test and if it works out well, it could be a common staple for all of our Nintendo Direct liveblogs.

- [**Live /r/WiiU IRC**](http://www.seddit.com/#join=WiiU)


Another way you can keep up with this liveblog is through RedditStream - comments will come in live, and you can freely comment and vote, as a normal Reddit thread would function, but in real-time!

- [RedditStream Page for the /r/WiiU Liveblog](http://reddit-stream.com/comments/1g49lw/)

____________________________________________

Guys, I'm also trusting you to remain civil in this thread as we will be watching closely. 

By all means, feel free to let your brain matter explode (I'm privy to such situations in the past), but please, no personal attacks of any kind, keep it contained in this thread and as a plea from myself (and the mods), if you're going to make link posts for any of the news that we get today, title your post accordingly and spruce it up a bit so that it looks approachable. We're fostering discussion posts for these games and if you are brave enough to take on this mantle, then you're helping us in keeping all the clutter to a minimum (and we thank you for that).

Again, any duplicate posts will be removed by moderators.

Have fun, leave luck to heaven and I'll see you guys around!

Considering that the PAL release is [around a day away](http://www.onlinecountdowns.com/countdown-clock/show/Europe%20Wii%20U%20Launch%20Date%7C50b84b60%7C1), I thought I would follow up on the [smashing success of my previous post calling Nintendo to task](http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/13u8xy/it_has_been_over_a_week_some_thoughts_on_the_wii_u/). Now, it's time to talk about some of the really awesome things about the console.

**Miiverse is something better**
I was sceptical [when Iwata touted Miiverse as a sort of empathy network](http://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-asks/Iwata-Asks-Wii-U-Miiverse-The-Producers/Miiverse-The-Producers/1-Empathy-Network-/1-Empathy-Network--662853.html). I mean, how touch feely does that sound? Well, I get it now. This is how this can typically play out:


1) I'm playing Trine 2 (worth every penny) and I get stuck on a stage. 

2) I hit the home button and bring up Miiverse. 

3) I'm directly within the Trine 2 community and I click to create a new post.

4) I can choose to type a 100 character message or draw my message. On top of that, I can choose to post a screenshot of the TV or Gamepad.

5) I choose to upload the view on the TV screen and type away a message asking for help

6) I hit the home screen again and return to the game


I continue playing around with the level and I still can't make heads or tails out of it. My homescreen button flashes...

7) I load up Miiverse from the homescreen and look at my notifications. I see 2 new comments

8) Turns out someone else is having trouble at the same area and also comments on my post asking for help as well.

9) The second comment is marked as a spoiler and I confirm I want to read it. It has the tip I need to continue.

10) I say thanks! and return to my game

All of this within about 5 minutes of time. There are examples of this everywhere in Miiverse. No need to set my controller down and practically no inconvienience. 

**Wara Wara plaza works well too**
As you may know, when the system boots, you will see different game orbs floating overhead with Mii's coming in and around, crowding underneith. If you tap on any of the Mii's, you will see questions like ""Is this game worth it?"", ""Can I use my headset?"", ""This application is a waste and someone should patch it"". This, along with lots of high quality drawings. You can follow through and see the conversation in Miiverse, find the game in the eShop or just add that Mii to your system.

We complain about advertisements on Xbox 360 (even if you've paid $60 for Gold!), and arguably, thats what Wara Wara plaza is. But Wara Wara does advertising better and it feels much more like a service... directing you towards games you may want in the future by letting you read comments from those who have already played them.

**GamePad benefits**
The most interesting thing about the Wii U, of course, is the GamePad. It's light at 500 grams and feels good in your hand. If you shake it around, you'll hear the abxy buttons move around, but it has nothing due to the cheapness of the device. The screen is in a true 16:9 aspect ratio and is big enough even for those with eye troubles. [Apparently, It can even survive nasty arguments with concrete](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=SIQpKh9ma88).

I've played around 15 hours with the TV on and around 10 hours without turning the TV on at all. Most games aren't doing anything mind blowing with two screens, but the benefit remains. BLOPS2 can play local multiplayer giving someone full view of the TV and the other a complete seperate view on the GamePad. I'm playing Trine 2 with a nunchuck and remote, when my Wife wants to watch Castle. That's ok, I just switch to the gamepad and take advantage of the drawing using the touch screen. 

Speaker quality is nice, although not mind blowing. Sound coming from the headphone jack sounds nice and clear. The demo for Rayman Legends shows off some really interesting second screen features and Nintendoland is a great example of why the GamePad is compelling.

**[I've mentioned it before](http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/13p44x/while_not_a_reason_to_buy_the_wii_u_by_itself_it/), but the browser is impressive**
100/100 on the Acid3 test, lots of HTML5 support, continued browsing while watching web video, and on. The web is a great place to look for information and further cements the absolences of paper game guides (unless your into that sort of thing, which is fine)

**What about if you don't really care for Nintendo?**
Microsoft has Smartglass and Sony has remote play. Sony has had remote play forever, but the feature up to this point has not been taken advantage of. Especially if Wii U takes off, Microsoft and Sony will be required to make it easy for developers to include second screen enhancements. How cool would it be to play BLOPS2 on the Vita rather than BLOPS:Declassified? Except with the Vita, you can leave home with it. If you are a fan of Smartglass, wouldn't it be cool if developers automatically develeloped with a second screen in mind, expanding similiar experiences from beyond just Halo 4?

And if developers are creating second screen experiences for PS4 and the Nextbox, wouldn't it be second nature to be able to port that over to the Wii U? Wii U promises to have one of the best experiences due to the imperceptiable latency between devices. But Microsoft and Sony may be forced to really push wireless technology further in order to compete. That would be great for everyone.

**[My previous disapointments](http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/13u8xy/it_has_been_over_a_week_some_thoughts_on_the_wii_u/) still stand** until they get fixed. Sorry. But, it is important to know that the system isn't perfect. And even though it isn't perfect, there are some really great things about the Wii U that should not be overlooked. The Wii U has a bright future and really is bringing in the next generation of gaming... quality second screen experiences that provides even greater flexibility to our games.

**tl;dr:** Wii U is worth it. Oh, and it is going to help direct where the next generation goes.

We should be able to get the video up first thing tomorrow (Saturday) so stay tuned!!!!**

Shigeru Miyamoto is in New York City this week to promote his first Wii U game, Pikmin 3, as well as his new Luigi's Mansion title for the 3DS, which is coming to the US on March 24th. I've been offered an interview with him, and needless to say I am beyond thrilled and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me!

I'd hate to blow the interview on the million dumb things I want to ask him, so instead, I'm offering my interview to you, /r/WiiU. Put your questions in the comments below, and at 10pm ET Tuesday I'll close things down and pick my favorites from among the top comments. I'll be sure to give everyone credit for their questions via reddit usernames in the interview itself.

The only thing I ask is that you keep your questions short and concise. While Miyamoto-san speaks some English, this interview will be conducted through a translator.

For some background/inspiration, you should check out his recent trip to Spain where he received the [the Prince of Austrias award](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up7_yBjoYw0) and if you've never seen it, [this 2010 profile](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/12/20/101220fa_fact_paumgarten) of him from the New Yorker is just amazing.

I'm hoping to get this interview up this Friday on my just-launched WiiU YouTube channel, [2nd Screen](http://www.youtube.com/2ndscreen), so it'd be great it you could subscribe :)

I'd also like to give a huge shout-out to my boss (and fellow sometimes-redditor) Mario Armstrong for helping to make this possible. We'll be running the interview on his site and have some additional gaming and Wii U-related content coming this month, including an early look at some upcoming Wii U games next week at South by Southwest, so if you could do me a favor and check out [Mario's site](http://marioarmstrong.com) as well I'd appreciate it!

Imagine watching Iwata announce new games on your TV, while on your gamepad, there is a direct specific Miiverse to discuss the announcements. When Iwata mentions that a game will be available after the direct (today it was Balloon Fight), a message would appear on screen that you could touch to instantly purchase it. After the direct is over, you could scroll through the various trailers shown or just watch the entire direct again. I realize that Nintendo's website already provides most of this basic functionality during the directs, but I feel like putting it on the Wii U and 3DS as well as the internet would give people who wouldn't know about the direct a chance to watch it.

P.S. Any updates on that Trine 2 update that was supposed to come out over a month ago? I'm kind of upset that I can't play with one of my friends locally with the Wii U pro controller yet.

This morning I walked in to Gamestop to pick up my preorder. 
Strangely, I did not get greeted with the usual ""Hey welcome to gamestop"" and rather had the cashier just stare at me as an african american male wearing black T-Shirt, black basketball shorts, white shoes, with a huge gamestop bag looked at me as he passed me walking out the door and promptly away.
I looked at the cashier who still had said nothing (and this is my go-to gamestop so he knows my face and I know him well) and said ""Uhhh... I need to pick up a preorder???"" but something was already wrong, I could tell.
He responded with ""Yeah you're gonna have to hold on... I just got robbed.""


45 minutes later, cops had showed up and took a statement on what happened, what I saw, and checked the video.. Yeah, the robber had a (probably .45 caliber) pistol and threatened cashier with it, then hid it so I didn't see.

Luckily me walking in is what scared him in to leaving.. So I guess I kinda helped technically...

Probably the greatest way to start a Sunday morning.

Never did get the game though. I'll have to go back for it later. 
He lost over $300 in cash and a few PS3's... The least I can do is to NOT say ""fuck that preorder I'll buy it somewhere else"". 


According to the cashier, he got a few PS3's and I think he said copies of Madden... 
So for the next few days I'll be looking for anyone in the area who just-so-happens to be selling ""Brand new PS3 unopened with an unopened copy of Madden"" on Craigslist. ;)

Update : Went back just now and same cashier was still there. He shook my hands, thanked me again, said I saved his life (actually a possibility). Said ""Here, personal thanks, this is the best I can do"" and took 10% off, joking that ""He'll put the reason for discount as 'Complained about the long wait'"" :P Updating now and should be playing within 5 minutes",,False,self,t5_2sjnz,1375659738.0,,,True,t3_1joqzr,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1joqzr/my_pikmin_3_preorder_pickup_story/,

So late on last year I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/14ti81/the_wiiu_video_streaming_server_ive_been_working/) about my video server software (vidiiustreamer) being in Beta, since then I've been working on version 1.0.

Changes since Beta include a completely redone GUI, multi and sub directory options, TRANSCODING, a section for films using information from Rotten Tomatoes, and general speed / usability increases.

I spent the majority of my time on the Wii U today mostly messing around in Miiverse, the most addictive social network since Facebook; playing Little Inferno, the best indie title I've played in ages; and just staring at Wara Wara Plaza, looking at all people's Miis from all over and watching them run all over the place when I mash on the gamepad's trigger buttons. 

And I've got Mario, Nintendoland and ZombiU to be playing instead!

This will get people interested in more of the games that are out, and are coming out.

I did some sniffing and sure enough I can confirm this to be correct. So to combat this you need to trick the YouTube servers to not use cache.


**For the Linux and network savvy this should be easy to do for the not so savvy I recommend reading through the link at the bottom.**


Block or add rules for the following net blocks in you firewall or in your router:

      206.111.0.0/16 (this is a huge block of ips)
      173.154.55.0/24

I also added anything that contains 

      c.youtube.com

What an insane difference this makes.

Just say'n YMMV but it works for me no more buffering issues in the YouTube app and in the browser video streamed at 1080p is flawless.

[Full tech details and credit go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/13kmvd/have_time_warner_internet_but_can_barely_stream/?limit=500)

I can also confirm this does not mess up or hoark any other google services. May improve Netflix and poss Amazon speed issues as well but thats TBD.

Also if you don't know what's up you should be watching AngryVideoGameNerd (AVGN) which is one of the reasons I hunted down a solution for this.


Edit fat fingered 

      206.111.0.0/26

1375868850.0,71,self.wiiu,1jvh5x,Thoughts on Lego City: Undercover from a 29 year old casual gamer after 100% completion.,Traulinger,87,16,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1jvh5x/thoughts_on_lego_city_undercover_from_a_29_year/,"**Intro:**

When I was younger, I played things like Super Mario Bros 3, Goldeneye, WCW vs. NWO Revenge, Halo, Diablo II, etc.  I suppose I considered myself a ""hardcore"" gamer at the time.  Now that I'm 29, work full time, and am married, however, I consider myself much more casual.  I still enjoy those genres (I own MH3U, ZombiU, NSMBU, etc.), but I also play a lot of Angry Birds and Candy Crush.
 
**Specifics:**

* Date Purchased: April 10, 2013

* Date Finished: July 20, 2013

* Purchase Price: $54.21 (w/ tax)

* Hours Played: 56.5

* Average Hours Played Per Week: 3.92

* ""Cost"" Per Hour Played: $0.96

**Pros:**

* Fun story line that doesn't hinge on an existing character or world

* Sandbox style gameplay that offers more freedom

* Tons of extras side quests and collectibles to increase time of play

* Unique game mechanics that utilize the gamepad as both a minimap and data scanner

* Lots of fun movie and pop culture references for us adults

* Age appropriate for children, but still fun for adults

**Cons:**

* Horrible load times

* Camera angles often resulted in almost unplayable areas

* Some collectibles almost impossible to locate without a guide

* Combat mechanics were super simplistic

* Red Brick bonuses made studs almost pointless.  I finished the game with billions of studs.

**General Thoughts:**

I really enjoyed playing Lego City!  The fact that it was a world not based on Superman, Star Wars, or another franchise was a real positive.  I loved how much stuff there was to collect.  It was frustrating at times, but it added a sense of accomplishment once you had located everything.  That was a huge reason why I got so much game time.  Think about it.  I payed less than $1.00 for every hour played.  How many console games can offer that?  I thought the use of the gamepad was well thought out and unique, and frankly, had I not have had the data scanner, I wouldn't have finished in nearly the time I did.  The movie references were a real plus as an adult.  It helped beef up the enjoyment of some of the missions for me.  I particularly liked the Shawshank references on Albatross Island.  On the downside, the load times were atrocious.  I realize sandbox games have more to load, but it was out of control in my opinion.  Additionally, sometimes the camera wouldn't pan correctly or the angle was off and this made it really hard to maneuver.  Also, I would have loved to see some more complex combat mechanics.  I realize it's a Lego game and they have to cover a wide demographic, but it was just a bit to simplistic for my preference (even as a casual gamer).  Finally, the stud mutlipliers made studs basically pointless.  It would have been better had the tokens been more expensive, or to have added some special super items that cost a lot, were bigger, etc.

**Conclusion:**

This was a great game and I'm more than happy that I purchased and played it through.  I think it has elements that will satisfy avid gamers and casual gamers alike.  If you haven't had a chance to play it through, I'd highly recommend it.  Even with some of the quirks, I still feel like it was a great value and provided lots of enjoyment.

Yes we all know you can emulate any game for free. But guess what? I can download any AAA title the day after its release for free too! Does it make it right? No, it most certainly does not. 

Now, on to the real issue. I know a lot of people are complaining about the prices of VC games. I am in agreement. Yes, I think paying $8 for a  SNES game is too much when it is locked to one system and can not be used on any other one. Sony allows you to pay for nearly any PS1 game ONE TIME and play it on all of your sony devices, this includes the PSP, Ps3, and PS Vita. What the fuck? If Sony can manage that kind of customer loyalty, I think it would be nice to have that from Nintendo too, but we dont even get to see most titles hit both the 3DS and the Wii/Wii U.

**BUT**

That doesn't mean that you should argue ""I can emulate it for free"". We can all go rob a bank or steal food for ""free"" but it isn't right. When prices and services are too high, don't promote piracy, vote with your wallet and dont buy the goods. Email them, phone them, whatever you have to do to get the point across. But simply saying ""Well fuck them I can do it for free"" isn't a great argument and it doesn't hold any weight. Show them that you use other better services like Sony's cross buy feature, or that you wont buy a Wii U or its games until they fix their shit.

We had about 8 people, and when we started some were yelling that the ghost was OP and the game was broken, but then we started to figure out how to communicate and use the map to our advantage and found the game to be extremely well balanced and tons of fun.

So I asked her ""are you telling me that there will be a update for the Wii U next week that will fix these freezing issues?"" and she again said that there would be an update and it would likely fix my problem.  The only other info she asked of my was what color the system was (so they can keep track of basic vs deluxe console issues I assume) and what game I was playing when it was freezing.

So there you have it, get ready for another patch and cross your fingers it doesn't take longer than a week.

Edit: For those that are interested, I have tried the following to try and fix it myself:
1) Set Miiverse language to English only, NSMBU still froze twice after this change
2) Changed orientation of the Wii U to vertical and disconnected it from the internet, I played for about an hour without any freezing
3) I reconnected it to the internet and started playing again for about 30 minutes without freezing.

At this point I haven't tested it enough with the internet connected to be sure that it has stopped freezing and will keep messing around with stuff until a patch comes out.

With the free version straight from the eShop, you do get access to one multiplayer level that you can play up to three times a day. However, if you buy just one item of DLC (which is only like 2 to 4 bucks) from the eShop, you can play it as many times a day as you want. 


I did 4 player multiplayer with a bunch of friends and we were laughing our asses off and having fun. You can use the GamePad, Wii U Pro Controller, Wii Remote, and Classic Controller/Classic Controller Pro in any combination. The game takes your picture for your on-screen avatar too, which can be hilarious. It reminds me a lot of Earth Defense Force on 360/PS3 if you're familiar with that game at all.


So, even if it is stupid, it's still a surprisingly fun party game. I also like the free-to-play approach, as I've only downloaded two multiplayer levels for a total of 8 bucks that I can see myself playing with friends for a long time (especially summer party fun season coming up). Definitely not worth 50 bucks at launch, but for free, or at least only a few bucks, it's a steal.

1356198099.0,61,self.wiiu,15acbq,"After surviving the end of the world and 3 weeks with the Wii U, here's my impression [Long]",Zoracka,78,17,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/15acbq/after_surviving_the_end_of_the_world_and_3_weeks/,"I live in Europe and got my premium Wii U on release date alongside with New Super Mario Bros U, Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed, ZombiU and Darksiders II (That I have yet to play, because I want to play through the first one first). English is *not* my native language, so bear over with me!

Before I list my impressions I will just list how much time I've used in the different games and apps. 

* New Super Mario Bros. U: 28 hours
* Sonic Transformed: 24 hours
* Nintendoland: 19 hours and 30 minutes.
* ZombiU: 9 hours and 40 minutes
* Netflix: 12 hours
* Miiverse: 9 hours

All in all I've used aproximately over 100 hours on the Wii U in december (I've not listed the misc. features such as browser)

When I buy consoles I don't expect nor look for powerhouses, I have my PC for that. What I am looking for on the console market is a working machine that can plug-and-play and thus easy accessibility. I do own a PS3 and a 360 along side my Wii U, where the PS3 have taken thousands of hours and the 360 alot less. 

* **The System**

The system is still *new* and I expect this to change someway or the other over the years just as the PS3 and the 360 have done. I agree the loading times are horrendous, but they have said they will improve it in a future update. Other than that I do really like the interface of the machine; it's slick and userfriendly and the ability to change where your apps are is a neat little feature. I think the WaraWara Plaza is an excellent choice to use on the mainscreen, but I do think they could use it a little better: For instance, when your friends join your plaza they could sleep if they were offline, wandering around if they are just idle and sitting with a gamepad if they are using an app. This should come with the feature when you press on them it says (as it does) last played title and *currently playing*. 

One of my bigger complaints however is the friendlist. While I'm glad they put the friendcodes in the trashbin, I do think it is utterly ridiculous that the friendlist is an app in itself that needs to be opened and that you can only access it by pressing the home bottum or through Miiverse (Not a problem when in a game but rather in the main menu). A thing I really like in the Wii U system, that was badly implemented on the Wii but proper on 3DS, is the Daily Log. It's a small thing, but I like being able to see how much time I've spent in different apps and games. I've not used the internet browser that much, but it seems like a really good browser and I like its accessibility from within games.

But overall I'm rather satisfied with the interface other than the loading times. I'm not a tech guy so my knowledge on the hardware inside the box is very limited. 

* **The Gamepad**

The most unique thing about the Wii U is definitely the gamepad and probably what most people were looking for. In this section I will merely talk about the quality and not the implemention in games. I do think that the gamepad is very comfortable to hold and play with. You really needed to get used to the second screen but for me it became natural rather fast. People have said that controller feels cheap but I disagree with that. I do think it feels very solid. The bottuns are very responsive, but I'd preffered analog triggers on the back rather than digital (for racing games). I like the thumbsticks and very glad they didn't keep the ones from 3DS. The resistive touch screen feels nice but the lack of multitouch could be concerning. The battery life is not the best whatsoever, but I rarely play 4 hours straight and if I do I can easily charge the controller while playing. I understand that not all people are able to do this, but personally it has not been a problem.


* **New Super Mario Bros. U**

I've always loved Mario and the games with the Italien Plumber. I have always preffered the 3D Mario platformers over the 2D and after playing a good amount of NSMBU I still prefer 3D Mario games. NSMBU is a great game, no doubt. But it is a safe bet from Nintendo and thus never really take any chances. I think most of the new power-ups (other than the acorn) is bland. I do enjoy the singing Yoshi's but they just don't improve the overall game. The balloon yoshi is like the helicopter suit, the bubble yoshi is more unique and interesting and the lightning yoshi is just a movable lightsource like we saw in NSMBWii.

 That aside, I don't think NSMBU offer any challenges before the very end. The last couple of levels before Bowser and all the star levels are interesting, hard and what I'd have liked more of. Where NSMBU differentiates from the previous titles in the series is the addition of the boost mode. To my surprise I actually enjoyed this feature thoroughly and had tons of fun with a friend by my side aiding or destroying my progress. I've not spent much time in the challenge but I expect to do that when I get the last 9 or so coldcoins I need. 

Other than the boost mode I think the gamepad is poorly implemented in this game. I think it's a lazy design choice to show the exact same thing on the gamepad as on the TV screen (It's extremely distracting, to be honest). I'd have preffered a interface like in NSMB for the DS. 

* **Sonic and All Stars Racing Transformed**

I never played the previous Sonic All Star Racing game, but this game should just not be missed. It's an absolutely amazing racing with excellent and tight controls, great sense of speed (not so much in boats and planes, but in cars it's incredible), good powerups and interesting and beautiful mapdesign. Personally I like the character rooster (20 characters) because they offer great variety and with 5-6 mods to each character you have loads of different characters. The game is also very challenging, especially if you try to complete each world tour on S-class (4 stars). It is not easy at all. 

I've not really played this game online but from what I have played I have had no connection issues whatsoever, the only problem is the amount of people playing it online.

Compared to Mario Kart (Unavoidable) this is definitely a strong competitor, probably the best yet. I like this alot more than I ever liked Mario Kart Wii (I really hated this, even with GC controller) and more than Double Dash (That I really loved). It's probably on par (or close to) the best Mario Kart games (MK64 and MKDS, haven't tried MK7).  

The gamepad is implemented as expected to this game, my only gripe is that the menus cannot be controlled with touch (Annoying, really). In the game you are shown a map on the gamepad screen, much like in MKDS, where you can see position of everybody in the race and their power-up. The game utilize the option to play purely on the gamepad by swiping your finger down (Or up for returning to TV + gamepad combo). 

And all of this comes from a guy who never really have been into Sonic games and Sega platforms.



 * **NintendoLand**

This game has surprised me, greatly. Almost all 19 hours of it is me playing it, alone. I think many of the minigames has alot of depth (Metroid, especially) and offers a great, but sometimes cheap, challenge. My favorite singleplayer games in this are Metroid, Balloon Kid and Octopus Dance. The multiplayer aspect of this game is excellent as well with great games in the Mario's -, Animal Crossing's - and Luigi's universe. 

What I really liked about the game that I didn't know of is the coins you get for playing the minigames. These coins can be used in a coindozer game where you can win prizes for your personal park. 

Off-topic: Making achievements this way could be very, very neat. I do think PS Home was supposed to be like this by showing off trophies in your appartment. 

On-Topic: NintendoLand is a fun compilation of great and not-so great minigames. Even for eingleplayer games I really enjoyed this game alot more that I expected to. 

The gamepad implemention is this game is very different from game to game, but overall I do think they have done an excellent piece of work implementing it into the game.

* **ZombiU**

I really like ZombiU. I really do. I'm just not that good at it because when I loose my survivor who I've used 3 hours with I get depressed and can't really be bothered to continue right after. But I really like the survival aspect of the game and how you don't just plunge down enemies like they were cockroaches. While one zombie is never really a challenge you need to be on your feet if you meet two or more. But the idea that you get a new character when you die or turn into a zombie is pretty cool and it's usually pretty sad killing off your previous character to regain your loot. 

ZombiU really use the gamepad excellent. You have a map of your sorroundings while playing, but it's also used to access your backpack without stopping the game. This help creating some very tense situations if you need to change your hotbars. 

**Conclusion**

I'm very satisfied with my buy and I really enjoy the Wii U. I like that I am able to use my Wii remotes and nunchucks on the system and that most games support this controlmethod as well. This is my first console that I got on launch and I think it seems like a great lineup for Nintendo, especially compared to the launch of PS3 and 360.

Feel free to ask me any questions and I'll answer (I've used up almost all my characters for a reddit post!). And feel free to add me on the system, my NNID is the same as my reddit username: Zoracka.

With the Monster Hunter Tri Ultimate demo coming out next week I thought I might take a moment to address all the people who have never played this game or played it previously and didn’t care for it.  This is not a guide so much as addressing common complaints people have when first introduced to this game.  I want to say I love this series, it is my second favorite series of all time.  Please don’t let any of these complaints scare you away from the game as most of them are just because of preconceptions people have going in because they are used to games making things easier for you, and this is not an easy game.

**Complaint #1: The controls feel clunky**
I don’t know anybody who has ever played this game and not been wary of how clunky it feels when you first pick it up, but don’t worry eventually you will learn how to make your character move much more fluidly.  One of the things I really recommend here is don’t go straight for that giant sword you see because in this game bigger = slower and slower = dead if you don’t know what you are doing.  This game is all about timing and strategy, it is not a blind hack and slash like Dynasty Warriors it is much more akin to Dark Souls or Demon Souls.  So if you are brand new to the game I recommend you stick with the old standby of sword and shield until you get more acclimated.  Even once you get acclimated there is some rigidity to how your character moves but that is part of the challenge of the game, making attacks and using items opens you up to attacks from your enemies, so you need to learn when to go and when to stop.

**Complaint #2: Where is the target/locking system?!**
There isn’t one, like I said before this game relies a lot more on player skill than most games these days.  Remember games where hitboxes matter?  This is one of those games.  In the beginning most of what you fight are just little guys and it doesn’t matter where you hit them, but once you graduate to your first true large monster it matters... a lot.  Monsters have complex hit boxes where head/legs/torso/wings/tail/underbelly all have different armor ratings and weaknesses as far as physical and elemental damage types. **Edit:Some people have informed me that there is a new camera feature in this version that will center the camera on the monster, but it isn't quite a target lock.  I haven't played with it yet so I can't speak much more to how it will work.**

**Complaint #3: Where is the health bar of my enemy?  For that matter where is my enemy?**
Tracking monsters is part of the game, so part of the challenge is finding and tagging the moster so that you can follow and hunt it.  As for the enemy health bar there isn’t one, this game does not let you know in obvious clear terms how close to victory you are.  You can estimate how close you are to killing something based on whether you have broken its wings/head or cut off its tail (not everything can be damaged in all these ways, nor are breaking these body parts necessary to kill something).  Eventually the monster may start to stumble and run away back to its nest to try and recover some health, at this point you need to finish it off as it flees.

**Complaint #4: The camera feels like it needs babysitting.**
The camera in this game does require more of your attention than usual, but eventually you learn to control it without even realizing you are doing it.  Most veterans forget this is was ever a complaint because controlling the camera is actually useful in this game.  Sometimes you will want to see where you are running, sometimes you will want to be looking behind you because a 12 ton dragon is chasing you, it is up to you to decide at that moment in time which is more important.

**Complaint #5: These starter missions are boring. (This probably won’t apply to the demo)**
Yes they are, but they are the tutorial, they are teaching you how to gather the resources needed to prepare for battle, now in the demo for these game they usually skip this bit and just let you fight monsters and give you gear/consumables so really you can skip this unless you are playing the full game.  The full game is trying to ease you in because once you start actually playing it gets really hard really fast. They don’t take that long but you will get through it.

**Complaint #6: Okay these real missions are really hard.**
Yes they are, and this is a hard game and you are going to hit several walls as you encounter new monsters but the feeling of conquering new challenges is worth it.  Seriously I’m not kidding this is a hard game, there is a reason I compared it to Dark Souls or Demon Souls, and that is because its hard in a way that challenges you as the player.  At times you may feel cheated, you may feel underpowered, you may need to go kill some lesser stuff a bit more for practice and better weapons/armor but you will conquer that challenge and you will come out far more satisfied than following waypoints as most modern games hold your hand and play more like an interactive storybook than a challenge.  **If you don’t like challenges this game may not be for you, if you grew up during the era of games that don’t push you this game may not be for you, if you grew up gritting your teeth over frustration of Battletoads and Megaman but kept going, this game is for you.**

**Complaint #6: There really isn’t much of a storyline**
No there isn’t, this game is not about story it’s about hunting monsters and pushing yourself.

**Complaint #7: I feel overwhelmed by all of the monsters/armor/items.**
So like I said there isn’t much of a story, having said that there really isn’t a fear of spoilers so if you are hitting a wall or need to decide what weapon to use/go for, then go online.  Seriously go online and look up weapon trees, videos of monster kills, tips and tricks.  This game isn’t about some secret hint that makes a monster go from impossible to easy, there are monsters that will go from impossible to hard but that’s about it.  This game is about you and your skill.  Weapon upgrades, armor upgrades, and items are merely tools not solutions.


**Below this point are more informative items and not really complaints people have, and really won't pertain to the demo much since they usually give you prefixed characters with armor/weapons already picked out**


**Tip #1: How do classes work?**
Classes don't work the way most people are used to, in this game there are 12 weapon types, each weapon type can be thought of as a class.  All weapons within a type have the same move sets and speeds, they just have different damage amounts and types and skill bonuses associated with them. Also in the full game choosing a weapon does not lock you into that for the entire game, and there are no requirements/caps on weapons, if you can make/buy the weapon you can use it.  The only limitation is that once you are in the field on an actual mission you are stuck with the armor/weapon you chose before leaving town, and can not switch until the mission is over.  There are only two classes of armor BladeMaster/Gunner.  Blademaster armor can not be used with bowgun type weapons, but Gunner armor can be used with bowgun weapons and non bowgun weapons.

**Tip #2: How do I level up?**
As I stated before this game is about skill, your skill.  There is no XP or leveling up.  In order to increase your stats you must get better armor/weapons. In order to get better armor/weapons you need to kill stronger monsters.  You do have a Rank which is increased by completing specific missions, once you have completed them you will get an urgent quest which when completed will unlock the next tier of missions.  What does this mean?  Well it means you can't grind on super easy monsters to make really tough ones easier, you can kill a bunch of a kind of monster to get materials to make better armor/weapons, but that usually means killing something fairly challenging for where you are in the game.  The best way to get farther in the game is practice and honing your skills as a player.

**Tip #3: How about character skills?**
So some armor and weapons will have attributes that give +/- to a character skill, such as attack/defense/hunger and more advanced things like windpress/ESP/earplugs/sharpness.  In order to actually get the boon/bane from those skills you need to cross a threshold usually 10/15/20 skill points.  The art of mixing armor and weapons to get the right skills you want is something beyond the scale of this post.

It's especially noticeable in Netflix when watching movies with a lot of dark scenes (just about every horror film).


[Eurogamer.net](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-nintendo-wii-u-review) seems to have noticed the same thing in their Wii U review. Below is a passage from their review:

""However, there is some unwelcome news - specifically that the HDMI output is locked to limited-range RGB only, with footage from all games we've captured thus far revealing absolutely no information in the 0-16 or 235-255 areas. Many digital displays - PC monitors in particular - don't operate correctly with limited-range RGB, giving washed out colours principally defined by blacks being more grey-like in nature. This is something Nintendo really needs to address as a matter of urgency - it's the most basic of omissions, something that Sony and Microsoft resolved to everyone's satisfaction many, many years ago.""

i just wanted to drop by and give you guys some info on the playtime of pikmin 3. i read some comments where they say that pikmin 3 has a playtime of 10 hours which simply is not true. If you ignore most of the fruits and infos and rush through the story you will get about 10h. Add another 10 if you want to get all the fruits, infos and so on. There is also the mission mode (also coop) + bingo mode which will get you another 10 to 20 hours, maybe more if you want to get all the best medals.

Currently you can purchase full Xbox 360 games for $2.99, $4.99, and $9.99 during their ultimate sale. This is the second time this year they have done this. Most of these titles are around 5 years old, some are less than a year old.

Dragon Age is $4.99
Mass Effect is $4.99
Bulletstorm is $4.99
Assassins Creed 3 is $14.99
Lots more

Sony is hosting a mega sale as well. Games are around the same price point and they seemingly have sales like this more frequently. Most games listed are 5 or less years old

Batman Arkham Asylum is $4.99
Lots more..

On the eShop a 25 year old Nintendo game costs $4.99... A 22 year old SNES game costs $7.99. A 15 year old N64 game costs $9.99, but only if you purchase it for the Wii.

I own a ton of VC games, but today it really hit me just how ridiculous the pricing is. I've bitched before about it, but Mannnn does this exposé just how terribly priced these games are.

What can we do to send a message to Nintendo that this has gotten out of hand? The games are not even tied to an account!! I'm done purchasing VC games until something changes. I mean beyond sending emails and calling we speak with our wallets. 

I don't think this is a fight the consumer can win though. At those prices if Nintendo sells 200,000 copies of a $5 game it would take 1,000,000 sales at $1 to equal it... Enough people buy into this bullshit that I don't see things improving for the consumer. Hell I own 26 VC games..

In hopes that no one else repeats this mistake, I will post here how it's done.

If you go to your friends list and add a friend, **it will not send a request to them**! They have to enter your name as well for it work. It's like the old friend codes.

What you need to do instead is add it via Miiverse. Here's how to do this (at least for the US version):

- Launch Miiverse

- Select ""User Menu"" at the top left

- Select ""Search Users""

- Enter ID

- Select ""View Profile""

- Now click on the ""Friend Request"" button at the top right

- Add a message if you wish and send

Now, the other user will see their home button blink and when they click it, it will tell them that they have a friend request. They can approve it from the friends list. You can see the pending request in the friends list as well. These requests expire after 29 days.

Also note that you do not automatically follow your friends on Miiverse. You'll have to do that manually from their profile.

Oh Nintendo why do you have to make things so uncessarily complex?

1376088202.0,57,self.wiiu,1k21ij,I think there is a lot of confusion in this subreddit between the differences of output resolutions and rendered resolutions. Lets have a chat /r/wiiu.,janitar1,71,14,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1k21ij/i_think_there_is_a_lot_of_confusion_in_this/,"So lately, I have been seeing a lot of people here thinking that the Wii U can upscale Wii (or gamecube games). While this is partially true, there is a lot wrong with how some of you think it is ""upscaling"". 

The Wii U supports 480-1080p output resolutions. When you set your settings to ""1080p"", it doesnt necessarily mean the games you run are going to be in ""1080p"". The Wii U will output everything in 1080p (or whatever you have the resolution set to) but the actual rendered resolution of the game will be the same no matter what.* 

What does this mean? ELI5 version: A game such as Skyward Sword will only make 480 vertical pixels per frame of the game. Now, the Wii U can take that image, and then make each of those pixels stretch so they come out as more than 1 pixel on your TV if it is higher definition. It can also do the opposite and scale down; say the render is 1080 vertical pixels and your tv is 480p, it will just scale the image down so it comes out on the tv without cutting too much of the edges off. 

**Your Wii U will not add anti aliasing (smoothing of edges) automatically on Wii or VC games** like the Dolphin emulator can. **VC games do not scale render resolution** as well (there have been very very rare cases in which they do). The only time you will a game outputting a higher rendered resolution than the original copy is if the game has literally been remastered (obviously emulators bypass the need to do this) like Metroid Prime Trilogy (render resolution increased when they added wide screen support). 

Most games will fuck up if you automatically add in widescreen or scale the render resolutions up- minimaps get all junked up, hitbox detections can get screwy, among other graphical problems. There are ways around these issues on emulators, but it doesnt just automatically work. Another issue with upscaling render resolutions is the fact that **textures do not scale up**- they will always stay the same. So a game like Conduit may look sharp and smooth when render res is scaled up, but the textures will look like butt hole. Look at Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, the game ran and outputted in 1080p but many of the textures remained very low res which in some peoples opinions, detracts from the experience. 

There was a video posted today showing Melee running on the Wii U with forced widescreen. The output resolution of the game was 720p, but the game itself's render resolution remained the same; 480p.You could tell easily by seeing all of the ""Jaggys"" from the scaled output. Since the game was running in the sandboxed vWii mode, there is no way to get around that, it simply can not be rendered higher. Now down the road we may see support for running those games in Wii U mode where emulators/loaders may actually be able to render games at higher resolutions but for now you wont see that happen on your physical Wii U or Wii. 


Someone has asked me to discuss **component cables vs HDMI cables**, here goes! So the biggest thing you need to know about these two types of cables is that HDMI transfers digital signals, whereas component cables deal with analog signals. What does this mean for you guys? Well not a whole lot in the case of the Wii U. **Component cables support resolutions up to 1080p, whereas HDMI support 1080p and up to as high as 2k** (for high speed HDMI). Since the Wii U only supports up to 1080p, **you shouldnt notice a difference in picture quality.** Now that really depends on the devices you use. Some handle HDMI better than Component and vice versa, you just have to compare on a case by case basis. Interesting things though with Component cables! Since they are analog (varying voltages that are interpreted by the TV as different colors) they are susceptible to signal interference from other cables, EMIm and RFI. This typically isnt an issue for most consumers though! HDMI signal can be messed up by very powerful magnets though so be careful around those things. One final note on cable differences. HDMI cables run a single cable with digital audio inside, component cables do not have this feature and end up having a mess of 5 chords.

It is a fantastic piece of kit. The pricing is great and the gamepad works excellently, I mean you have to try it to believe it. At first I thought I'm just buying this for Zelda  and Mario but now seeing how well the system works together I have to say that the machine deserves so much praise. 

Regarding the drought of games Nintendo land satisfies me and will continue to do so for months while I have Darksiders II to play through with all the extra content, I missed it the first time round, which I bought for £15/$22; I will get round to buying assassin's creed, also  £15, eventually. But really if Nintendo make a big effort with the first party titles then the system is worth it without third party support, for me anyway. (Thats not to say I dont want more third party support, I find the attitude some fans take, 'Didn't want it anyway"", when a developer doesn't put a game on the Wii u is unhealthy for the system.)

So in summary here are my thoughts.

Pros-Fantastic gamepad integration where developers can be bothered
       
- Nice, although could be improved and will be, Miiverse
       
- Internet browser is better than my family's home computer
      
- Some good games if you haven't played them before

- Big first party games coming in 2014
      
- Price

Cons - Miiverse needs improvement, which will happen, for now a con
      
- Slow OS 
       
- Lack of third party support

This FAQ will be a constant work in progress, so if you have any suggestions or additions, or if you see any errors, please PM me as soon as possible!  Let's keep our subreddit spam free and help Wii U owners at the same time!

* Wii U Availability

1. **Where can I purchase the Wii U?  Is it in stock?** - Most online retailers are past the initial shortage and have been receiving a steady supply of both the basic and deluxe consoles.  You'll need to check the individual retailer's website to verify if they are currently in stock.  The same is also true of brick and mortar stores.  In the US, most Best Buys, Walmarts, Targets, and other ""big box"" stores have a plentiful supply.  Some people looking for the Wii U in metro areas may find it harder to locate a store that is not out of stock.  If your ""big box"" store is sold out, check the retailer's website to see if there is another store in your area that has the Wii U in stock.  It may require a lengthy trip if you are adamant about your purchase.

* Wii U Games

1. **What games are currently out for the Wii U?  Do you know the release date for (insert game here)?** -For a list of all current and upcoming Wii U games, please [visit this Wikipedia entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wii_U_games).  Please note that not all upcoming games have a release date and that those with dates may have them changed without notice.

2. **Why am I unable to purchase certain games from the eShop?** - Depending on the country you live in, you may not be able to purchase titles intended for an older audience until certain times of the day.  Users in Europe may be restricted from purchasing games with a rating of PEGI 18 to between the hours of 2100 and 0600.  This restriction is not in place for North American (US, Canada, Mexico) users.  It is currently not known if Japanese users will have restricted access to games on their eShop.  Other titles, such as Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and Skylanders Giants, are currently not available on the eShop and must be purchased at retail.

* Wii U Console

1. **What precautions can I take to prevent my Wii U from being bricked?** - Make sure that when you are downloading and installing system updates that you have a reliable connection and power source.  If you lose your connection or power during the download, you won't brick your console.  Wait until you are able to reconnect to the internet and/or are able to power on your Wii U.  The system will automatically start the download from where it left off.  If you lose power during the installation of the system update, you *may* brick your console.  If this happens, [contact Nintendo customer support](http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/index.jsp) immediately. 

2. **Are the system updates required to play my Wii U?** - No, you may press ""CANCEL"" for any of the Wii U system updates.  It will, however, download in the background and prompt you to install the update at your convenience via the download manager in the home menu.  If you do not install the initial system update you will not have access to certain Wii U network features.  These are: Nintendo Network ID creation and linking, Miiverse, Nintendo eShop, Internet Browser, Friends List, Wii U Chat, Notification List, Download Management, Wii System Transfer, Software Updates, and USB storage.  You're required to install the initial update to unlock these features on the Wii U.  Not installing future system updates may block your access to Nintendo Network features and may prevent games from launching.  Nintendo has stated that systems sold after early 2013 will come with the initial update preinstalled.

3. **How long does the initial update take to download and install?** - The time to complete the initial update is dependent on the speed of your internet connection.  It may take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours.  If you're impatient, press ""CANCEL"" when prompted to download the update.  It will be downloaded in the background and you will be able to use your Wii U in the meantime.  Installation of the initial update takes about 10-15 minutes.  You are not able to use the Wii U while the update is installed.

4. **My Wii U froze while at the main menu/in a game.  What do I do?** - If your console freezes at any point, attempt to power down the Wii U using the power buttons on the GamePad and the console itself.  If that doesn't work, unplug the console directly from the wall/surge protector!  Do not unplug the power cord from the back of the console!  This may damage your Wii U!  Wait 15-30 seconds and plug your Wii U back in.  Everything should return to normal!  If this doesn't help matters, you may need to [contact Nintendo customer support](http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/index.jsp).

5. **If my screen/projector doesn't have speakers, can I use HDMI for video and RCA for audio?** -  No.  This setup is currently not supported by cables with multiple input/output types or the console itself.  You may be able to receive audio if your screen/projector includes an audio out port that can be connected to your speakers or sound system and supports the Wii U's LPCM audio.  You can also try to use an HDMI to VGA (with audio) adapter that is powered and 1080p ""capable"".

* Wii U Accessories  (Only purchase and use first party Nintendo and/or officially licensed third party accessories!  Items below are linked for demonstration purposes only!  Unless specifically stated otherwise, they are not meant as recommendations!)

1. **What controllers am I able to use with my Wii U?** - At this time, you are able to use one Wii U GamePad, the Wii U Pro Controller, original Wiimotes including newer Wii U branded Wiimotes with built in Motion Plus, original Wii Nunchuks including newer Wii U branded Nunchuks, the Wii Classic Controller, and the Wii Balance Board.  Nintendo has stated that in the future the Wii U will support up to two Wii U GamePads on one system.

2.  **I'm unable to use the HDMI cable that came with my Wii U.  What are my options?** - If you are unable to use the included HDMI cable, you must purchase either a [component cable](http://www.amazon.com/Everydaysource-Compatible-Nintendo-Wii-Component-U/dp/B00A8B3NLO/ref=sr_1_9?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354882082&amp;sr=1-9&amp;keywords=wii+u) which can display up to 1080p, or a [composite cable](http://www.amazon.com/Everydaysource-Compatible-Nintendo-Wii-Composite-U/dp/B00A8B3QB6/ref=sr_1_5?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354882082&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=wii+u) which can only display up to 480i.  Component and composite cables are not included with your initial Wii U purchase.

3.  **My wifi is spotty/I don't have a wifi connection!  What can I do to connect my Wii U to the internet?** - If you have a spotty connection or are in a location without wifi access, you must purchase a [USB ethernet adapter](http://www.amazon.com/Everydaysource-Compatible-Nintendo-Wii-Ethernet-U/dp/B00A8B3LTI/ref=sr_1_7?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1354882082&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=wii+u).  You can plug the adapter in to any available USB port on your Wii U system.  Make sure that it is intended for use with the Wii U as otherwise it may not be recognized by the console and you won't be able to connect to the internet.  The Wii U does not come with a built in ethernet port.

4. **Can I use the GamePad or Pro Controller to play games (including Virtual Console titles) in Wii mode?** - At this time the GamePad and Pro Controller can only be used in the Wii U main menu and for Wii U apps and games.  There has been no word as of yet if Nintendo plans on adding support for the GamePad or Pro Controller in Wii mode.  You can use any of the original Wii accessories or the rebranded Wii U Wiimote and Nunchuk in Wii mode.

5. **Do Wii U games that use the Wiimote require motion plus?** - It depends on the game. For example, The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest and Metroid Blast in Nintendo Land require the use of Wiimotes with Motion Plus while the other inlcuded games do not.  Other games, such as New Super Mario Bros. U, do not require Wiimotes to have Motion Plus.

* Nintendo Network

1. **How do I add friends on the Nintendo Network?** - There are two options available.  The easiest is to search for your friend in Miiverse, and send them a friend request with an attached note.  This adds them to your friends list as well as notifies them of your request and prompts them for approval.  The other option is to add your friend via the Friends List app, however this will only add them on your end.  Your friend will need to access their Friends List app and mutually add you as well, similar to the UFC system on the original Wii, DS, and 3DS.  Neither party is notified of being added by the other when using the Friend List.

2. **I've added my friend, but I can't see their online status.  What do I do?** - Your friend hasn't yet added you to their friends list.  Visit Miiverse and send them a quick message or resend the friend request from within Miiverse.  Online status and certain other information is only shared between users that have mutually added each other.

3. **I had a great time online with other users, but I don't remember their exact name?  Is there a way to find them again?** - Yes!  In your Friends List app, there is an button on the bottom titled ""Users Played With"".  Tap this to display other users that you have recently met.  Tap on any player to view their Nintendo Network ID, what game you last played together, and what time.  You can also send them a friend request by tapping the ""Send Friend Request"" button, or by visiting their profile in Miiverse by tapping ""Go to Profile"".  Remember that to notify a player that you have added them and to prompt they add you in return you must send the friend request via Miiverse.  It is possible that both parties are prompted and notified when tapping ""Send Friend Request"" via the ""Users Played With"" tab in the Friends List, but has not been confirmed.

4. **How do I send messages to my friends?** - Messaging is located in the Miiverse app.  Once the app is loaded, select ""Messages"" on the left hand side.  Miiverse will display a list of your friends (and those from the admin and moderation teams if you've been naughty!), with a clip of the most recent message you've received or sent below their name.  Even if you haven't yet sent or received messages with friends, they will still be on this list with ""You haven't exchanged messages with this user yet"" under their name.  Simply tap on the green arrow and your message history will be displayed.  Tap on the ""Write Message"" button in the bottom right to send a message!  Messages are threaded, similar to threaded texting on smartphones.  Receiving messages from friends will cause the home button to quickly blink twice, similar to when a friend logs on to the Nintendo Network.

5. **Can I sign in to more than one Nintendo Network account at the same time?** - At this time it is not possible.  Future updates may or may not include this feature.

6. **I bought the Deluxe Wii U, how do I participate in the Deluxe Digital Promotion?** - Visit the [Nintendo Network Premium/Deluxe Digital Promotion](https://p.nintendo.net/) website, select your region, and log on with your Nintendo Network ID and password.  Your DDP account is created automatically when you created a Nintendo Network account on a Deluxe Wii U.  Points are retroactive and granted even if you have not yet accessed the DDP website.  You will receive approximately 10% of your purchase back on all digital purchases, including codes purchased at retailers and redeemed on the eShop (A $59.99 USD purchase will net ~599 points towards your DDP balance).  Currently points are redeemed 500 at a time to receive a code for $5 USD credit on the eShop.  The Digital Deluxe Promotion will run until the end of 2014 and any remaining balance and codes must be used by March, 2015 wherein they will be permanently deleted.

* Tips and Tricks

1. You can move the icons on the main menu!  Tap and hold the icon, then drag it to its new location.  Folders like those on the 3DS are not yet implemented.

2. You can power on the Wii U, as well as your TV and set top box, via the GamePad.  If you forgot to set your TV during the initial setup, the options to do so are located in the System Settings app!

1361561510.0,54,self.wiiu,191d0u,Monster Hunter Tri U Demo: Tips for new players part 2,found_a_penny,59,5,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/191d0u/monster_hunter_tri_u_demo_tips_for_new_players/,"Hey all, so I was the author of this post last week: [Monster Hunter Tri Ultimate Demo tips for new players](http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/18kxfy/monster_hunter_tri_ultimate_demo_tips_for_new/)

It was mainly focusing on key complaints people historically had about the series when starting out but not specific to this demo because... well I hadn't played this demo yet, so I thought I would throw together a quick post now that I've played the demo.  

First couple general points I want to make.  Monster Hunter is a fantastic game with a steep learning curve and an intimidating play style.  Very few people pick up the game and say hey this is great!  A general rule of thumb I've heard before is it takes 5 hours of play to really *get* the game and learn to play properly, and it can take another 5 hours to truly get hooked.  That may seem like a large time investment, but this only applies to the first MH you pick up, once you play any monster hunter game you can pick up any other monster hunter game and be ready to go in under an hour (weapon sets and movesets change between games).  Also keep in mind the full game easily has 150+ hours worth of content.  Part of the reason I think this game has such a high initial time investment requirement is because it plays very differently than most games today, the closest I can compare is Demon/Dark Souls, where it requires you to switch gears a bit if you are not used to the style of gameplay.  Secondly its a hard game, and it will challenge you and frustrate you.  The game requires player skill more than simple experience/gear grinding, and to be honest the series is not for everyone.  

I think the biggest reason that the series has not taken off here like it did in Japan is that having a friend who plays makes it a lot easier to learn, and a lot more fun to play.  Group hunts are much more fun than solo (in my opinion anyways).  So far this series hasn't reached that critical mass point where there are enough people playing that they have other local friends playing that they can get together with.


**Tip 1: There is a manual!!**
I didn't even realize this until I saw it in another thread, but there is in fact a manual with the game, if you are in the demo and press the home button, at the bottom of the screen you should see an option to view the manual, this is very helpful for explaining a lot about the controls and goals, and more specifically the attacks for specific weapons.


**Tip 2: The new monster targeting camera is great, you should use it**
This is more useful for the 3ds where you are lacking a second thumbstick to control the camera, but its good for either system.  To use it you have to be in the same area as the monster, then once you have found him you will notice on the touch screen there was an icon of a gray dragon with a question mark over it, it should now look like a stylized picture of the monster you are hunting, if you click that then crosshairs will appear over the icon and you have activated the monster targeting mode, now whenever you tap L it will point the camera at the monster instead of straight ahead.  Tapping it twice will look straight ahead.  You can also reverse that in the camera options in game.

**Tip 3: What weapon should I use?**
This one is really tricky because different people prefer different weapons, and some are less viable for beginners in the demo due to time constraints(In normal missions you traditionally get 40-50 minutes, though you rarely use it).  I still recommend that people use the sword and shield to get more familiar with the game, I can kill the Yeti monster in about 10 minutes with it, so you definitely have the time, but it will be closer than with other weapons.  Dual swords is a bit harder to use because you can't block but if you want a challenge then I recommend this weapon for beginners because it keeps you a lot more mobile than other weapons but gives you higher damage output, the cost: no blocking.  Here is a simple breakdown (in my opinion) of the strengths and weaknesses of the weapons. My personal favorite is the longsword, but it can be tricky to use.  

| Weapon   | Damage Output    | Mobility     | Can Block      |
|:-----------|:------------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| Sword &amp;amp;amp; Shield        |  Low        | High        | Yes        |   
| Dual Blades        |  High        | High        | No        |
| Great Sword        |  High        | Low        | Yes        |
| Long Sword        |  Med-High        | Medium        | No        |
| Hammer        |  Med-High        | Medium        | No        |
| Hunting Horn        |  Med-high        | Medium        | No        |
| Lance        |  Medium        | Med-Low        | Yes        |
| Gunlance        |  Med-High        | Low        | Yes        |
| Switch Axe        |  High        | Medium        | No        |
| Light Bowgun        |  Medium-Low        | High        | No        |
| Heavy Bowgun        |  High        | Low        | Optional (No in demo)        |
| Bow        |  Medium        | High        | No        |

Another breakdown of the weapons that goes into more detail can be found [here.](http://monsterhunter.wikia.com/wiki/Weapon_Types)

**Tip 4: Is the demo an accurate portrayal of the game?**
Yes and no.  They are only showing you the hunting portion of the game, but they are giving you full access to all weapon classes against 2 monsters.  In the real game there are something like 52 monsters that qualify as actual challenges.  Also in the full game you have access to an insane amount of armor and weapons that can be gemmed and augmented within the 12 weapon categories.  They are also throwing you straight into the thick of it and if you don't have experience with any MH game in the past, you are probably going to have a bad time.

Beyond the hunt, a large portion of the game is preparation, this game has an incredibly rich crafting system and requires you gather resources from hunting monsters and mining and bug hunting and foraging.  It is about planning for the monster you intend to hunt, what kind of damage does it do? That will affect what armor you pick.  How fast is it?  Does it have breakable body parts?  Can you sever the tail?  All of these will affect what weapons you pick.  And if you are playing with friends then that also affects what decisions you make, some classes work better together, if you have a 4 man hunting team then its usually best if at least one person is ranged so you aren't fighting for space to attack the monster.

**Tip 5: Is there multiplayer in the demo?** No.

**Tip 6: Why do so many people love this game but I'm not having fun?**
Well there are one of two reasons.  The first reason is that unfortunately the game might not be for you.  If you like the concept but you are struggling with the controls and it feels clunky then I say you keep going and you are just in that unfortunate awkward stage.  Like I said up above this game has a drastically different playstyle than most other games, so most beginners feel like your parents did when you tried to teach them to play Super Mario Brothers.  They just don't get it and they give up before it clicks.

It's a catch 22 here, the full game brings you into the game slowly with boring gathering missions and hunting low level stuff to get you more familiar with the movement and zones, but doesn't really prepare you for real fights.  The demo gives you really good armor and weapons against a relatively easy monster but no real prep on how to play the game so you feel lost and like everything is clunky.  Capcom's biggest problem with this series is how to properly get new players into the game.  They have gotten considerably better but its still an awkward climb at first.  **Remember this is one of the most popular games in Japan, and it is for a reason: Its fun if you can get through this awkward phase, you just gotta get through it.**

**Tip 7: Items**
When you start the actual mission you will be in a little area with two chests, the red chest is used to drop off items for certain missions but that doesn't matter here.  The blue/green chest however has additional items that can help you on your mission, this is your supply chest.  Any items you get from the supply chest in the normal game will be confiscated at the end of the mission so you don't can't take them home.  


| Item               | Description                                                                       |

**Tip 8: Enraged Monsters**
You may notice that when you do a lot of damage quickly you may see the monster's breath and it is moving faster, this means it is enraged.  That means that it moves faster (duh) and does more damage, but will also take more damage if you hit it in this mode.  High risk and high reward.  Also flash bombs and sonic bombs won't affect them when they are like this.  Some monsters have other tells such as changing colors or markings appearing.

Were planning on just selling it on eBay for $600 then waiting and getting another one. In a sense would have been a free Wii U, not including the wait time!
But after getting home with it, couldn't do it - we sat down and tore that box open!
We only grabbed New Super Mario Bros U because... Well, we were already spending $300 on the freakin' thing lol.
After the 1.5gb, hour-and-a-half update, which was admittedly annoying, we were able to hop in to Mario. Kind of disappointed solely because in multiplayer with a wiimote + the tablet, only one person can play as Mario - the other person just taps the screen to drop platforms for Mario to jump on. To play with Mario + Luigi you need a seconds wiimote (which we have but got lost when we moved!)

So the multiplayer was kinda disheartening. BUT when I got home last night, I turned on the Wii U, TURNED OFF, YES, turned OFF MY tv, then proceeded to play NSMBU on JUST the tablet controller. Like, I was playing full fledged Wii U game on just the tablet controller. You can actually do this with Black Ops 2, Assassins Creed 3, Batman : Arkham City, and many more games - basically, you can play on the TV OR you can play on the tablet - turns your tablet in to a DS-XL that plays COD, AC, etc. as long as you are in range of the base console which is about a 30ft range.

How that works is pretty simple, the controllers sends your inputs to the console, the console runs/renders the game, then simply streams the information back to the tablet controller. The catch? It's super fast and responsive. Believe me I've used such applications as Splashtop on an iPad, and OnLive too - it'sEXTREMELY fast, you can't even tell there's a Wii U console rendering off-device - It SERIOUSLY feels like you are playing the thing as a gameboy. It is SOOO responsive - I can't stress this enough because it literally feels unreal to me how fast it runs!

Also of course these games DO run 60fps on the tablet (assuming the game runs 60fps which I believe all current WiiU games do.)
The thing does have great build quality as mentioned, this Tuesday I will be stopping by Gamestop to grab a screenprotecter for the tablet because... I screenprotect anything with a touch screen.

I got the 8GB white console, because the Target I work at was out of preorder cards for the Black one - what are the differences? The Black one has 32GB, has a tablet stand for watching movies and such on the tablet controller, a stand to hold your Wii U upright like most people have their Wii, and includes the Nintendoland game. On that note, the white 8gb Wii U does not include any game. From what I understand, Nintendoland is not a whole bunch of fun if only playing by yourself, or maybe even one friend, but is a lot of fun playing with 4-5 people. Similar to how Wii Sports was.

All in all I wasn't looking forward to it being a kickass console after playing with it in Gamestop's kiosk, but now I LOOOVE it. I just wish I had more moolah to get more games - playing Black Ops 2 Zombies (I'm not even a COD fan, rather I usually hate the series) while laying on the bed, or kicking back in my deskchair, on the tablet controller, sounds AWESOME. The 1.5GB update was annoying but what can you do, it's more than possible it fixes some console-breaking function they found or something, I'm not gonna complain.

As of now it EASILY gets this following score from me, because, as much as I hate to admit it, the tablet controller really IS innovative. It will play a huge roll in a lot of games. For the first time, the Wii controller has the same number of buttons on it as a PS3 or 360 controller - 2 joysticks with click-in buttons, 4 facebuttons, start/select, L1/L2/R1/R2 and a home button. The fact that you can give the TV to someone to watch TV on, and just play on the tablet is simply intelligent. I also forgot to mention one of my favorite features. When setting up the console for the first time it asks you what brand TV you have, and then pulls up an ON-DEVICE TV REMOTE. You can control your TV FROM THE TABLET CONTROLLER. You can turn it on/off, volume/channel up/down, change input, and put in a channel number. What is so great about that? It's nothing new, just a universal remote, right? Wrong! It's the GREATEST feeling that when I get home from work I can just drop down on the couch with THE TABLET CONTROLLER. Don't have to search for and find a TV remote, don't have to sit it on the couch next to me, nothing. ALL you need to play IS THE CONTROLLER.

A lot of people think the controller looks awkward. IT DOES... LOOK awkward. But somehow Nintendo did it right. It feels good to hold. It's not at all heavy. It has a built in rechargable battery pack and includes a charger. I have yet to let it run out of battery, but only played it for about an hour without it plugged in. It's extremely responsive. Probably the best joysticks, buttons, and dpad Nintendo has ever put in a controller. The screen is about 6.2 inches and feels right. Smaller and it would feel like a little ipod touch in your controller.. Bigger and it feels like a kindle fire in your controller... They really found a sweet spot. The resolution is very good too, you can see single pixels if you look really closely but it can't be very high-res or it becomes too much data for the console to stream to the controller. The quality is very good anyway, PPI is more than great. 

For those wondering, the 8gb vs 32gb isn't a huge setback. You can plug in any regular USB harddrive up to 2TB in size and install games to it just like the built in memory. Nintendo has said this, and players have confirmed it. No worry about running out of space when you can have 2 terabytes of space!

The only complaint I've heard/had with it is that some menus take a long time to load, such as the settings screen which takes upwards of 10-15 seconds. I can look past this though as most features that take long times to load I won't be using often. For me the thing is a gaming device, and game load times aren't long - that and Netflix, which has fine load times, too.

AS OF NOW, THE WIIU GETS A STRAIGHT 10/10 FROM ME. I'M NOT A NINTENDO FANBOY EITHER. I HATED THE ORIGINAL WII, BUT THEY SURE AS HELL DID EVERYTHING RIGHT WITH THE WII U! GO. BUY. ONE.

I will still adding things to this today as I am messing around with the system, but if you know something I haven't written here yet please comment and I will add it asap.


**Main WiiU Menu-**
Top left corner shows the current User.

* When making a new user for the console you can only use the ones already created on the machine or transferred from a 3DS(maybe Wii).

* It seems that each User ~~needs a different email~~ can use either a different email or use the same email for multiple Users. You also need to set up a password for the User account. I think its because you make a unique Nintendo ID for Miiverse and all your data is tied to the User ID for Miiverse and purchases.

* When making a new User, the Home menu resets to however the Channel icons were arranged by the User and certain games have different game saves based on which User is currently logged in.(ZombiU)

* **It looks like each User gets a different Friends List.** My list is not big enough to see if its 100 people shared or an individual 100 people per User.

* &gt;If you press the TV button, the start and select buttons ( + and - ) controls the volume, X and Y controls channel up and down. Courtesy of doodoohappens.

**Miiverse**

* There is a Manual for how to work Miiverse when you click under User Menu (top left corner) and choose Settings/Other.

* While browsing through comments and you click on a user, you can see some information about them and can choose to follow or add them as a friend. If you follow you can see all of their posts on the Activity Feed. If you friend them It should show up as a request on their Notification bar. The max number of people you can follow is 1,000. Max number of friends is 100, since they're added to your ~~console~~ User list.

* &gt;In Miiverse if they have a cube with a checkmark on it when posting it means they own the game. Courtesy of Rapptz.

* &gt;If you end a post on Miiverse in ellipses, it changes ""Yeah!"" to ""Yeah..."" Courtesy of cannedpasta.

* ~~While sending a friend a message for some reason I had the option to attach a picture of my current WiiU menu. Not too sure why it doesn't work in the communities or why I can't choose other pics.~~ After some experimentation I found that if you're in the middle of a game and can hit the Home button to get on Miiverse, when you post a comment you can attach a picture of the current game screen.

* While browsing a Miiverse community you'll notice that a post will have the persons icon on the left followed by the name, and right below that is the icon for the game. In the Nintendo Land community sometimes there is a green tag with the name of one of the minigames such as *Donkey Kong's Crash Course/The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest*. If you press the comment for lets say *The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest*, and clicked the tag right next to the Yeah! button. It filters all of the Nintendo Land comments to only show the ones from *The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest*.


**Internet Browser**

* Youtube videos seem to work fine.

* If you hold ZL and ZR you can tilt the gamepad to scroll. Alternatively, pressing just ZL or ZR lets you jump tabs. Up to 6 Tabs can be open at once. 

* Holding down X when pulling back the curtain will start a drumroll.

* Opening a video in Youtube, you can slide it up and go on different tabs/websites while the video plays on the tv. (Doing it right now actually)",,False,self,t5_2sjnz,1353462026.0,,,True,t3_13is91,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/13is91/wiiu_console_tips_n_tricks/,

* The Wii U menu and Miiverse all looked extremely impressive, new, and innovative when shown Sunday. Miiverse was elaborated on during the developer roundtable and it sounds really good how well it is integrated into games like New Super Mario Brothers U.

* Confirmation of the Wii U GamePad having STICKS was great, we definitely needed that compared to the circle pads of yesteryear. The idea of putting the full game on the screen on the GamePad is still revolutionary, as we can now play Mario on the big screen and then seamlessly move it to the controller.

* The Wii U Pro Controller looked like a solid controller to offer core gamers. I think playing a game like New Super Mario Brothers U with the Pro Controller instead of a sideways Wii Remote would be perfect.

* Pikmin 3 was awesome. There's no denying that it'll be one of the best games at/around launch. Amazing graphics, Wii remote OR Wii U GamePad controls, it looks like the game to beat.

* New Super Mario Brothers U didn't disappoint. The trailer itself uring the conference didn't offer much, but the Nintendo Direct and developer roundtable fleshed out the idea of how the game will work that sounds really good. The game has a traditional overhead view of the overworld, a la Mario Brothers 3, which was really cool. Plus, the integration of Miiverse looked really neat, with friends leaving comments and pictures and reactions and tips embedded within the game (which could be turned off of course). They also briefly mentioned how asymmetric gameplay would be integrated into 5-player (!) multiplayer. One player has the gamepad and can put objects/boxes/whatever into the game world for the other 4 players to use. 

* NintendoLand is shaping up the be the Wii Sports of the Wii U, which is totally fine, especially if packed in with the system (which all signs point to Yes)

* Scribblenauts Unlimited looked really fun, and one of the best uses of the GamePad with touch screen object creation. I'll definitely be getting that when it comes out. 

* Zombi U seems to be the exclusive mature killer app we've been wanting to see. Cynics labeled the game as this generation's Red Steel, but the previews and impressions from the gaming press seem to all say the game is awesome, and definitely worth picking up.

* Batman, Mass Effect 3, Aliens, Assassin's Creed III, Darksiders, and more old third party stuff at least gives us SOMETHING to play with our new system and in new ways. Putting the full game on the GamePad's screen, and/or using the GamePad's screen as map, inventory, or whatever gives us a NEW way to play games. This lineup is stronger than DS, Wii, or 3DS launch lineup, despite being old, it's better than NOTHING.

* Confirmation that all Wii digital downloads will be transferrable to Wii U was a big deal for me. I would be ecstatic if GamePad screen use was confirmed for Virtual Console games!!

Overall, between Nintendo's multiple showings, I'm still really excited about Wii U. The best launch games for me will be Pikmin 3, NSMBU and Scribblenauts, but there is a lot to keep me busy in the months following like Zombi U, Wii Fit U and all of the 3rd party ports.

And all of them think it is a ""big mistake"" that Nintendo not holding a big press conference. And now i watched the Adam Sessler video and thought the same:

Maybe the press is bitching about because we will get our Info directly from Nintendo.

Think about it, in the past, you go to your favorite site and read all the news about new games. News like: ""Nintendo announcing a new 2D Zelda game, which looks kinda lame"". And immediately you copy that opionen and think about :""yeah, looks kinda lame"". 

But if you did not read that news, and watched a Nintendo Direct, maybe you think different about the game. Maybe its more like: ""OMG a new Zelda game, and its in 2D! Best game ever!"".

What i try to say, Nintendo forcing you to think YOURSELF about the games they announce. And not reading an opionen from a gaming journalist.

With more sales that particular dev will feel more inclined to produce us more content, it will also get some other devs out there interested. 

Another side note, if a game is coming out on all the systems with a Wii U version along side them, even if you own the other systems snag the Wii U version, once again same concept, it shows the dev we're interested which gets them interested. Not to mention as shown with Need For Speed coming out, the Wii U has better tech than the previous gen systems, so you might be getting a better looking game.

My family had an NES, SNES, N64, (no gamecube), etc when I was growing up. I moved to PC and xbox 360 gaming once I got to college, so my habits never really dwindled.

Well, my live-in girlfriend and I purchased a WiiU together because I thought it would be fun and easy enough for her to do something I like together. We play the Lego series games and she really enjoys the ""Pinkmin,"" as she calls it, game in NintendoLand. She does this mostly because she knows it bothers me. 

So, onto the reason I made this post. Video games 'hogging' the TV have always been an issue with whoever I was living with be it family, roommates, girlfriend, whoever. With the off-screen feature of the WiiU, I love the fact that I can sit and ""watch TV"" with my girlfriend while tending to my farm in Harvest Moon or killing monsters in Monster Hunter.

No, your eyes aren't deceiving you, I really am a moderator now! 

After my hard work on the wiki, and having the most submissions here (according to Stattit), I guess that it was only eventual... either way, I hope to move this subreddit forward as the Wii U's lifespan continues on and on.

_______________________________

Now, with Nintendo Direct fast approaching and [with worrying concerns](http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1g0s1i/a_plea_for_rwii_u_regarding_e3/) that the subreddit will be buried in tons of posts, I've suggested to the team that we either:

- hold a special Nintendo Direct live discussion thread here on the subreddit

**or** 

- direct folks to /r/Nintendo's ND thread, since they've had a really great standing with their last few ND posts (and I can vouch for their reliability)

**or** 

- direct people to the official /r/Games Nintendo Direct thread which was confirmed not too long ago.

There are a few folks looking to create special E3 discussion posts and we'll promote them accordingly.
_________________________________________

Also, in regards to news coming out of Nintendo Direct, we're definitely expecting tons and tons of endless reposts, sadly. 

Someone had suggested that the community would be able to curate the content properly, and I figured that it would work (albeit slightly, though my optimism is sorely lacking), but mods will have to put in the extra muscle to remove any duplicate posts.

We're looking to keep things as streamlined as possible and to free the subreddit of unnecessary clutter, even as our minds explode from the flurry of E3 news.

Another idea that I had tossed about were individual discussion posts for games that were announced which would contain ample information (trailers, release dates, etc.), but I figure that it would quite an uphill task to create threads for every single game, so again, that's up to you in the comments to decide.
_________________________________________

Of course, the subreddit rules still apply and we expect that you'll engage in civil discussions over the course of the week as we learn more and more about upcoming games.

**EDIT 1:** JoeJoeBillyBob has taken on the mantle of hosting the Nintendo Direct liveblog. I'll be working closely with him to ensure it works well, and any duplicates will be removed (including link posts to the ND itself). Furthermore, mods will be on the lookout for duplicate news posts, as the first posts will get priority.

Personally I feel the system is truly amazing. Nintendo has really come up with something entirely new and innovative. NSMBU is crazy good and looks soooo incredible. Haven't gotten to ZombieU or Nintendoland **yet** ;-)

I can't wait to see what their first party development brings to the system and really show off what it's capable of doing.

Recently I was looking for a way to watch a new show (Shingeki no Kyojin aka Attack on Titan, good manga, but recommend the anime as well) on my Wii U.
Couldn't find any uploads onto Youtube, so I decided to search on the browser.  Came across multiple sites carrying the video, but all requiring flash player which just won't do for WiiU, despite the browser allowing you to play videos from Youtube's site.  Then I came to the understanding that WiiU can handle Html5, hence why they play from Youtube.

Simple solution: Find video sites that support Html5 video streaming. Namely mobile sites are particularly known for this.

So I tried a site like [http://www.animeshippuuden.com/mobile/mobile-list](http://www.animeshippuuden.com/mobile/mobile-list) and was able to watch full anime episodes from the comfort of my couch.  And they streamed flawlessly on my Wii U.

If anyone knows of any other sites that work well on the browser, feel free to share them here.  Also, check out mhoop's excellent guide on [how to stream your own videos to your Wii U.](http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/15r8n3/an_easier_guide_to_streaming_videos_from_your/)

TL;DR: Search for mobile video sites. Watch on Wii U.",,False,self,t5_2sjnz,False,,,True,t3_1cxahg,http://www.reddit.com/r/wiiu/comments/1cxahg/watch_anime_and_other_online_videos_on_your_wiiu/,
