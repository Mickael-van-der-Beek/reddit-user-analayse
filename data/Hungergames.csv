1332878007.0,207,self.Hungergames,rgbm4,Why Mockingjay(book) had to be so dark [SPOILERS],demusdesign,232,25,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hungergames/comments/rgbm4/why_mockingjaybook_had_to_be_so_dark_spoilers/,"Just finished the trilogy over the weekend, and like a lot of folks I'm discovering, I had no idea what to do with the ending. So dark, so unsatisfying after all that build-up. Now here's what I think:

**What we thought Suzanne Collins was doing:**

* writing an incredible action-suspense-coming-of-age story that was character driven. 

* Appealing to teens with a Twilight-esque love triangle.

**What Suzanne Collins was actually doing:**
 
* Luring us in with her characters and love story to send us a stark message about the dangers of war, celebrity, totalitarianism, classism, consumerism and more.

* Turning us as spectators into something like the villains of the book (Weren’t the arena scenes the best to read? Weren’t we also entertained by teens and tweens fighting to the death?)

While there was a lot I did not like about *Mockingjay* (basically meandering, dazed for 80% of the book through the halls of District 13, taming Katniss’s fire into a prop for the rebellion) the ending was so ugly and unsatisfying that ultimately I think it tied everything together. 

We want Katniss and Peeta to go through this horrific series of events and come out as heroes. But they (particularly Katniss) come out as prototypical post-traumatic-stress victims. For her to come out any other way would be to condone everything that happened to her. “What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger right?” Well not when what is trying to kill you is heinous and completely irredeemable. That Katniss is a mess at the end is a major indictment of the events that led her there. 

Frankly, I hated reading *Mockingjay*, but giving it some reflection I can see that it had to be this way. I’m thankful that the ending was so gritty and unsatisfying because it should make us question why we were so entertained by the first two books. 

In so many ways, in the first two books, our eyes were the Capitol’s eyes. Falling in love with Katniss and Peeta. Letting the senseless violence send us to the edge of our seats. Yelling for the blood of the Careers in the arena. Collins could have just given us over to that. But in *Mockingjay*, we pay for it. We see the cost. There are victims. The victims are our heroes, either completely gone (Prim) or wounded beyond repair (Katniss and Peeta). Collins won’t let us off easy because she is holding on to the hope that we are not the Capitol.

My opinions were partially shaped after watching Suzanne Collins answer the question ""What do you want your readers to take away from reading the books?"" **[here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH15DI8ZW14&amp;t=02m10s).**

Instead of talking about love or personal empowerment or coming-of-age, I was a little surprised to hear her talk only about ethical and social issues. This clued me in on what I think her real motivation was for writing this trilogy.",,False,,t5_2sfjs,True,,,True,t3_rgbm4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hungergames/comments/rgbm4/why_mockingjaybook_had_to_be_so_dark_spoilers/,

Before you downvote, hear me out.  The book set up undertones of a rebellion from start to finish.  And we all agree the bread was the most emotional part of the book. But had the movie included the bread, it would not have carried the same impact.

Here what the rebellion scene set up: it lays the groundwork for the second movie, it shows the frustration the districts are under, it shows the devotion the district has for Katniss.  Everything the bread does in the book.

Had the movie included the bread, it would have had to add the following: what each district grows/produces, the fact that each district can pool resources to the sponsers, how the bread was an act of defiance...

All of those things would have required at least another 10 minutes to the movie, yet they were able to show all of that with a quick rebellion scene, which I thought was extremely powerful. I say kudos to the movie for accomplishing so much with this change.",,False,,t5_2sfjs,False,,,True,t3_rc81j,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hungergames/comments/rc81j/my_thoughts_about_district_11_in_the_movie/,

It went from overused memes and pictures of marginally related items to some actually quite fascinating discussions. I loved these books, and I enjoyed the movie, and when I came to this subreddit I had significantly higher hopes for the content here, but unfortunately it has fallen short. As a result, I think it would be a quite beneficial challenge to go text submissions only for one week, maybe more, and see if the content quality improves.

First off, I have to say that I am not a Hunger Games ""fanatic"". In fact, I was really opposed to reading the books/seeing the movie because it seemed very Twilight-like in that it attracted the attention of teens across the world. I typically don't like being part of a fad. So, I waited and by chance the movie played at my school's theatre at the beginning of this semester. I found that it actually was not that bad and decided to give the book a read, with NO intention of reading on into the series.

Little did I know I'd be sucked into it. And tonight, I finished Mockingjay, and the question that keeps coming to mind is: This was meant to be a young-adult novel? Holy shit.[warning scope](/b ""I unfortunately had Prim's death ruined for me via a Tumblr post, but I was skeptical and certainly did not expect her to die in the way that she did. I was in shock for a few minutes. The whole undertone of the ending of the book (the depressing, dark, secluded feeling) really caught me off guard and I was very surprised at how it ended. Most books end with a semi-happy ending, but I couldn't help feel depressed. Even in the epilogue I was like...NO."")

So, my praise goes out to Collins. She really captured what effects war can have on a community, children, and in the media. Well done. I commend you.

Does anyone have any similar experiences?",,False,,t5_2sfjs,1353717962.0,,,True,t3_13nhs9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hungergames/comments/13nhs9/just_finished_the_trilogy/,

I'm not a fanatic, but I feel the need to defend it because they aren't the same. Just because there are similarities, doesn't mean one ripped the other off.

Both stories are essentially echoing the Roman Colosseum. Its possible that Susan Collins was inspired by Battle Royale. But its also likely she was inspired by Roman culture, The Running Man, 1984, Lord of the Flies, and a ton of other popular and culturally significant stories. Let's take THG as it is - an original story, and move on!

Collins pulled no punches and created a complex and rich world, addressed some very dark and important themes, and crafted a character in Katniss that was truly flawed and damaged, but who rose above her despair to do the right thing. Nearly all of the major characters were really well-treated and multi-faceted...

Except Effie. There was one moment back in the first book where she's expressing a kind of outraged indignation at how her Tributes were being treated where for a brief, brief moment she seemed like someone more complex than the superficial aristo she'd been made out to be. I said to myself, ""I see a heroic sacrifice coming for her...""

Then she vanished in book 2, not seen again until a perfunctory ""Whoops, I forgot I had this character"" scene in book three.

So the Capitol teases the districts, reminding them constantly of how they will be punished soon. However, the districts are very persistent in their belief that they might still win. 

As times goes on, the Capitol's tormenting stops completely. The people start to celebrate, because they think the Capitol has abandoned their plans to build this strange arena where their children will be sent to die. 

Little do the people of Panem know that the arena is finished, and the Capitol has been giving them a false sense of security; the first annual Hunger Games are about to begin.

The tributes aren't chosen in such a civilized manner at this point. A boy and a girl from every district is chosen by some nameless person working for the Capitol. Then, at a non specified part of the day, two very unlucky families receive a knock at the door. 

They are congratulated immediately - further mockery - and told that their child has been chosen to participate in the first annual Hunger Games. The boy and girl are then immediately taken, while screaming mothers and fathers try to get their child back, and escorted into a black limousine. 

The only thing the children are given is a tracking injection and plain, grey uniforms. They're told the rules (of which there were few), and the objective, and nothing else. The children are all taken to the entrance of the arena. 

Twenty-four doors begin to open, as forty-eight worried eyes dart around, scoping the area. A countdown begins. 10, 9, 8 - everyone's heart is racing - 7, 6, 5 - a girl from district nine begins to panic and makes a run for it, and is immediately obliterated by a landmine - 4, 3, 2 - the moment of truth has arrived - 1.



That's my take on how it would've gone. It's not finished (probably never will be), that was just a small illustration of how it would've happened.

She said she would never forget his face. The face of a man who had just found out he was going to die. He stood up and reported to the office and he met with the recruitment officer. She said she didn't have a lot of time with him after that. She said she loved him and saw him off. They found out three months later that he died in an attack on their base.

yesterday i went and saw the hunger games again and realized that this may be plausible because
1) they make a point to show that she is familiar with plants and surrounding foliage during the training  scene where she is at the big screen matching the different plant silhouettes with apparent ease

2) from the moment she ran into katniss and didnt attempt to kill her, we know that she has no intentions to kill anyone, so it makes sense that when it came down to the final 5, she would either be too intimidated or maybe to pacifistic to kill anyone so she decided to take her own life

If someone is a fan, then they're a fan. If the movie gets a lot of people to read The Hunger Games, that's *good*. New fans aren't a bad thing. Popularity and the things that come with it aren't a bad thing. They don't, or at least shouldn't, detract from your enjoyment of the books and/or the movie, when it comes out. 

If you like The Hunger Games for whatever reason, like it for that reason, and don't give a damn why anyone else does or doesn't.

That's kind of how I felt at the end of *Mockingjay*. The thought that Primrose might die never crossed my mind because Katniss was shouldering all the fighting and war while Primrose stayed safe in district 13, training to be a doctor.

Sure, I read some books here and there for school growing up, but I mostly skimmed and never cared. I have never read a book just for fun. I saw the Hunger Games movie and was moved. I immediately bought the first book on my way home from the movies. Even at this point I had no idea if I will be able to read it. I read the entire book in one sitting. Never in my life have I done anything like that. The movie helped me paint a picture in my head which is something I have been unable to do by myself. I became attached to these characters in a way I have never felt before. I rushed the next day and bought the next 2 books. I read both of those in the next 24 hours. I stayed up until 5 a.m. Sat night reading Mockingjay. Once I finished I felt sick to my stomach. It wasn't the way it ended but the fact it ended. Never in my life have I become so emotionally invested in something. I am not sure how many of you will actually understand. The books ending, knowing that there is no more. Knowing that I can not go home tonight and snuggle up and find out what happens next depresses me. This felt worse than even my hardest of break ups. I can't sleep. I can't eat. I am just depressed. I keep trying to convince myself not to read them again. To just try to move on. I have no experience dealing with this sort of abandonment. I don't know what to do.

Am I the only one who found it extremely ironic, and somewhat disturbing, that people starting cheering when tributes (such as Glimmer, Cato, and the girl-who's-name-I-don't-remember that tried to fillet Katniss) died horrible deaths? One of the major themes of the whole damn series (I have read all three) is what happens when a society becomes completely desensitized and views violence as entertainment. Cato, in my opinion, was NOT the ""bad guy"". Sure, he was crazy as hell, but he was raised to be a killer for the sake of entertainment. If he failed, the survival of his home and family were at stake. 

People seem to forget that, even the crazy ones like Cato or Glimmer, are CHILDREN. Children are being forced to kill each other so someone else can get their kicks. 

The Capitol prepare for the event for months on end, can't wait to find out who the tributes are. They make costumes and buy special souvenirs. Media coverage is through the roof, and everyone is on the lookout for details.

The Capitol media makes some out to be protagonists and heroes (Katniss), and others to be the ones they love to hate (Cato). The Capitol denizens coo at the mushy scenes, and cheer when the bad guy dies. Sound familiar yet?

And some of us were cheering at a child's death right along with them.

When food is so rare that most people barter, isn't money worthless?  Like when those Eastern European economies collapsed and the streets were littered with useless money.

If District 12 had bakers, why didn't they also have farmers?  Why wasn't everyone who wasn't a coal miner a farmer?

Were there quotas and then the districts could just keep what's left over?

I keep hearing that Katniss settled, or that this relationship was one solely based on circumstances.  I don't think that this is appropriate, and I wanted to explain why.  All of this information is clearly in the text, so I don't expect it to be news to everybody.  But, the fact that Collins mentions this as an aside after having spent three books driving wedges between Peeta and Katniss makes it hard for a lot of people to pick up on what she intended.  

 Early in the first book, Katniss remarks that she can never separate Peeta, dandelions, and bread in her head. The dandelion was a symbol of hope, life, and renewal for her. Remember. After Peeta gave her the bread that saved her life, and her family's lives, she saw a dandelion in the distance. The bread alone would likely have not been enough to have saved their lives. It was a temporary reprieve from their starvation. But, the dandelions showed her that there was something for her to do, and that she had the means to pick her life back up and save her family.  She could collect them and feed her family, and it suggested that she winter was giving way to spring.  She could hunt and gather, and so feed her family.  

At the end of Mockingjay, Katniss says that she could never have been with Gale. His fire was too much for her, and they could never have survived as one. She says that she needed, all along, the dandelion (Peeta) that symbolized rebirth and life. Those qualities in Peeta complemented her fire and aggression. And that wasn't just because of what had happened. Remember, she said that this is what would have had to have happened anyway. She had to end up with Peeta, as they are much better for one another.  Peeta was, just as the original dandelion, she spring after the brutal deadly winter.  Just as she was about to give up hope, she recognizes the meaning behind the dandelion (Peeta), and sees that spring and rebirth are right around the corner, and that there is hope for rebuilding.  

An interesting thing to note is that the dandelion always follows a major event.  But, the dandelion is always more important psychologically for Katniss.  Originally, she saw the dandelion after being given the bread.  The second time, the dandelion came after winning the war, and preventing Coin from replacing the Capital with another dictatorship.  I think that the story of Peeta and the loaves at the beginning of The Hunger Games is a microcosm of the entire narrative arc that follows.

Again, she didn't settle for Peeta, and she didn't only end up with Peeta because of circumstances. Her coming together with Peeta in the end was the best possible result for her, and she recognized it as such.",,False,,t5_2sfjs,False,,,True,t3_tqa0r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hungergames/comments/tqa0r/katniss_peeta_and_gale_spoilers/,

A whole layer of meaning that you may have been missing: If you attended the premiere of the first film, you probably saw the shots of overdressed, entertainment-crazed fans cheering as they watched inhumanity go on. They chose favorites to root for and fell for manufactured relationships. They applauded the death of their least favorites.

&gt;.


In the film, when we see them, where are they sitting? That's right, they're in cushy seats, watching a screen. They're basically in a movie theater. The director intended that. The film is saying, ""You could be these people.""

&gt;.




That's why I was terrified when almost everyone in my premiere audience clapped at the deaths of Clove and Cato. A girl was beaten to death against a wall. Cato delays killing Peeta to explain that his life doesn't matter, that he's been raised to kill from day one. Practically begging the audience for some pity before he died. When he was mutilated by wolves, *they clapped.*

&gt;.




Would the games exist without Seneca? He is not the driving factor. He could easily be replaced. Snow is no different. He's just a part of the madness.

&gt;.




Readers, viewers, people, remember that there is a greater enemy behind it all: that part of our nature which craves the sight of bloodshed, which refuses to see past the surface of the stories we are told, which cares more for fashion than for the starving or afflicted.



&gt;.



I'm not saying that people shouldn't be satisfied by justice. I won't say we have to give our lives up to save the poor. But we must stop rejoicing in violence. It's ok to be impressed by a show of power or to want the villains stopped and kept from doing harm ever again. Regardless, death is always mournful. Annihilation is always the least desirable outcome. Even when we are just watching a movie, we should react compassionately.

So, my wife recommended the book... it's a pretty good story, but I feel like it could have been so much better with a more competent writer.

Instead of pointing out all the spots that drew me out of the narrative, let me focus on the one that's freshest in my mind: the ending. It would have been a perfect ending if she had just ended the book with Coin's death, but instead she wrote a bizarre ending that just feels so unfulfilling. Not in the poignant kind of ""it hurts, but it couldn't have ended any other way"" way, but in the ""wtf, what was the author thinking?"" kind of way.

Not to mention ending with Coin's death would have been ambiguous enough to leave the door open for future installments of Hunger Games. Instead, we're left with this lame ""well, everyone is still traumatized but Kat is now 20 years older and has begrudgingly popped out a couple kids. The end.""

[SPOILERS INSIDE].,TareXmd,68,4,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hungergames/comments/svt58/finally_finished_mockingjay_i_see_what_all_the/,"It hit me hard, Prim's death. I'm trying to think of a way to make it not happen, but in a strange, horrible way, it seems essential. Either we get this ending, or a typical ""happily ever after"" ending where Katniss eventually makes it to Snow, shoots him in the head, thus making all the other deaths count (well, 'count' in a very unsatisfying way --the rebels would have killed him anyway), with the entire country being giddy --and the end. Typical, expected, unfulfilling, yet relatively happy. This ""happy ending"" was the ending I was waiting to reach. It seemed inevitable, with everyone dropping one after the other, till Gale got captured and Katniss made it to the mansion, and I was thinking, 'this is it'.

I have to say, I find the ending -while extremely irritating- also extremely masterful on Collins part. First, the irritating bit: Keeping Prim alive was the whole point of Katniss volunteering. She was Katniss' only motivation, thus the reader's only motivation. Prim was hope. She was the innocent future that lied ahead. When she died, so did everything else. Even if the Katniss/Snow/Coin exchange hadn't occurred, everything good was already gone with Prim's death. But she had to die. And this brings me to why the ending was so masterful.

When Prim died, it gave me something else bigger to look forward to. Panem. Coin was proving to be yet another Snow in disguise, and it all came to light when they decided to bring another round of Hunger Games. Killing Prim brought upon Coin's demise. It showed that the happy ending isn't really about Katniss on an individual level, but Panem as a whole. It also helped Katniss decide it was Peeta she needed to survive. It also led to Snow's ""irrelevant"" death, since it really wasn't all about him, as a person. Prim's death triggered a chain of events that lead to a much deeper conclusion bigger than Katniss, Snow and Prim as individual people. It had to happen. It was sad, and you can feel the remnant bitterness in Katniss' life when the book ended --you can feel she'll never be a 'happy' person again... The kids and Peeta could give her something to look forward to, but not enough to make her a 'happy person'... It felt sad, but it also felt so utterly realistic. Hunger Games is no fairytale with a fairytale happy ending....

The exchanges between Katniss and Snow were incredible --both the one in his room, and the looks they exchanged before she took out Coin. Sutherland will absolutely deliver on the big screen. Another piece of masterful writing. Also, when she took out Coin--dammit that was one insane moment in novel-reading history. It made so much sense, and it was made better by the fact I never saw it coming. I also loved how Collins didn't seem to hint at it in any of Katniss' internal monologues.

Other annoyances were also diluted by Prim's death, like losing Finnick. Eversince he was gone, I lost a great deal of motivation. I saw a widowed Annie and their orphaned child, and thought nothing could make up for that, not even a Katniss-delivered arrow into Snow's heart, especially knowing that the rebels would have got to Snow anyway. It made me hate Katniss for her selfishness, causing all those deaths for her own personal vendetta. However, Prim's death brought matters into prespective, and it was no longer about losing Finnick, killing Snow...etc.

In short, I'm really sad that Katniss didn't get a 'Disney happy ending', but I also do not feel betrayed, given how 'real' this ending felt, and how dramatically it was delivered. Well done, Ms. Collins.",,False,,t5_2sfjs,True,,,True,t3_svt58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hungergames/comments/svt58/finally_finished_mockingjay_i_see_what_all_the/,

Based on this subreddit and other message boards, I was wondering if I would be able to enjoy the movie with so many people who didn't seem like they were going to pay a huge amount of attention.

5 minutes before the theater dimmed, the manager got everyone's attention and said:

""Please turn off your cell phones.  Everyone paid good money to see this movie today - they don't want to see your smartphone light up like a distracting beacon with its big screen.""

""I will be doing spot checks during the movie to make sure people have their phones off.  If I see one on, I will turn my very bright flashlight on you and I encourage everyone to boo you until you leave the theater.""

So it was a lovely, quiet theater with not single phone screen lit up (I sat in the top/back row, so I would have noticed).

-Peeta, Haymitch, Effie, Cato, Rue, Snow, Caesar, and Seneca are all perfectly cast.  

-My favorite scenes they put in into the movie was either the turmoil in District 11 after Rue's very sad death, and especially the one where Seneca is locked in a room with a bowl of nightlock in the center after Katniss and Peeta win.  SO GENIOUS!

You can't always have time to put flowers on their body, like Rue. I loved how Peeta's character changed into this psycho maniac, and then was built back up.

Here is a quote from a Lionsgate representative:
""As with the first film, we won't be confirming, denying or commenting on any casting rumors for this title. We will announce news wide when there is official casting news to announce.""

This speaks for itself.  If Lionsgate hasn't said so, then the casting role hasn't been confirmed.  You can see what has and has not been confirmed by following this link:

I know this book is hard to classify in either direction gender related, but I was watching interviews with the cast and for some reason several mentioned it was aimed at younger girls. I never got that vibe reading it, and I still don't believe it. Love the books, love the movie, and I have a mad crush on Jennifer Lawrence.",,False,,t5_2sfjs,1341776270.0,,,True,t3_w7ran,http://www.reddit.com/r/Hungergames/comments/w7ran/i_keep_hearing_the_hunger_games_is_for_girls_guys/,

1)the sleep syrup scene. I really wanted to see the him mocking katniss and telling her that she's a bad liar and then the look of betrayal on his face while she makes him swallow it.

2) I Would have also liked to see at the end more of the hurt in peeta when she tells him it was just an act since I think it was major part of peetas growth.

Maybe it will be in the extended scenes on the DVD? //fingers crossed
