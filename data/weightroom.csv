### What is TheSquatRack?

Story time.  Long ago I realized that most fitness tracking sites were not heading in the direction I would prefer, and they
were not particularly suited for serious athletes in their sports.  So, I decided to make my own, and this is the current
result so far.  This marks the start of Beta2.  There's been pre-alpha (just me), alpha (about 10 users), and beta1
which had approx. 100 approved accounts.

* **Goal**: Data-driven workout tracking to engineer better athletes
* **Link**: [TheSquatRack.com](https://thesquatrack.com)

Basically, **I'm looking to add more users to test, give feedback, bug report, etc.**

The general flow is register -&gt; wait for me to approve your account -&gt; happy time for all.

##Intro##
Over the years I have seen a common trend of lifters choosing programs ill-suited for their goals, experience, or situation.  All too often I read of new lifters jumping on programs like 5/3/1 when they can still use linear progression per workout, using Smolov Jr. when their work sets are 55 lbs., or an intermediate lifter jumping on Smolov (just the base mesocycle portion) and then wonder where their strength gains went after a couple weeks off the program.  

Similarly, I’ll see a lifter want to make strength gains but do ridiculous amounts of conditioning and endurance work which hinders their recovery and strength gains.  Reading these situations over and over again, I became more and more frustrated as I simply wanted to yell at them, “What the hell are you doing?!” but that serves no purpose other than (impolitely) informing the lifter you don’t agree with their plan.  

Just last week, I was doing my heavy squat day and had someone came up to me and asked if I was training for something and after making some small talk, I found out the person I was talking to was new to lifting but was starting with 5/3/1 which would not be optimal for such an inexperienced lifter.

So, this post / rant serves as my personal canned-response to the inevitable question, “Well if I shouldn’t do that program, what should I do?” I am speaking from my own experience and the experience of others I have observed.  This is not an algorithm to determine what program to do, but rather, outline several important points that should be considered every time one wants to move to a different training methodology.  It is merely a guide I’ve followed when choosing my programming or recommending a program to another person, nothing more.

##Goals##
The first step, and one of the most important aspects of choosing a program, is determining the goals you want to accomplish with a lifting program.  Sometimes the goals are generic such as, “I want to get stronger” or more specific, “I want to add 30 lbs to my squat.”  From these two simple goals, there’s already a variation in the type of programs that would be generally recommended.  In the first case, no specifics are stated so a generic strength program like Starting Strength or 5/3/1 might be suggested (based on the lifter’s experience) whereas in the second example, a focus on squats is required, so Texas Method or Smolov could be possibilities (no mention was made of maintaining or increasing the bench press or deadlift, thus making a squat-centric peaking program like Smolov more viable).  That isn’t to say other programs would not work, but they might not be optimal for the chosen goals.

The more explicit one can be with their goals, the more likely the lifter will choose a more optimal program to reach said goals.  While saying “I want to increase my squat” is a nice goal, it’s very vague.  “I want to add 15kg to my squat in 12 weeks and add 5kg to my deadlift in the same time” is a much better goal as it has definitive numbers, a time constraint, and encompasses more than just one lift.  Additionally, the more experience a lifter has, the better (and more realistic) goals they can create.

For example, the lifter may know that their deadlift maintains or increases with their squat even without direct pulling work, so they may only need to choose a squat-centric program (with bench press work) to achieve a higher powerlifting total.  

Another possibility is that the lifter knows they get a lot of carryover from their overhead press to their bench press but not from their bench press to their overhead press.  With this nugget of information, the lifter can aim to improve their bench if the program has dedicated overhead press work (such as an overhead press day with assistance work such as push-press).  

A final example might be a lifter needing more conditioning work while increasing strength.  This could be accomplished many different ways, such as GPP, HIIT, speed sets, less rest time, drop sets, etc.  Knowing ahead of time that there will be conditioning work will allow better choosing or planning (such as making sure the heavy squat day is not after a farmer’s walk / sled push conditioning day that was added in to achieve a conditioning goal).

##Progression##
Knowing the correct periodization scheme a user can follow will go a long way in not just choosing a good training program, but also in excelling past their current strength levels.  An inexperienced lifter can usually make strength gains from workout to workout through neuromuscular adaptation whereas an elite lifter may be only able to make strength gains over the course of many months.  Thus, it would not make much sense for an inexperienced lifter to immediately jump on a monthly progression program (a la 5/3/1) or an elite lifter to necessarily jump on a linear progression style program (there are many caveats with elite lifters as they know their body and response to training schemes better than most lifters, so tweaks and personalization they make to a program will likely give higher dividends in part due to their experience).  

I believe that a lifter should attempt to follow the most aggressive form of periodization they can.  That is, if a lifter can make strength gains from workout to workout, they should be choosing programs that follow that format.  Similarly, if a lifter can only increase strength from week to week, weekly progression programs should be chosen.  If a lifter chooses periodization that is not aggressive enough, they are not quite wasting time, but they are underutilizing their body’s ability to adapt.  However, if they choose too aggressively, the worst-case scenario is a deload followed by switching to a slower periodization format.

##Internal Factors##
Part of choosing or tweaking a program is evaluating the program itself to see if it’s in line with your primary and secondary goals.  When trying to increase your squat, it becomes much more difficult to do so while deadlifting heavy every single week.  It’s certainly doable, but certainly not as easy or efficient as focusing solely on squats.  Similarly, if a lifter wants to increase their bench but the program they’re on has them overhead pressing too much and it starts hindering their bench workouts, they need to reevaluate if the overhead pressing work is necessary for their goals.

In addition to the lifts within a program, it’s also important to take into consideration the caloric intake expected during a training cycle.  The results from two identical lifters running Smolov, one on a cut and one on a bulk, would be vastly different.  High-volume / high-intensity programs run while on a cut will increase the risk for injury as the energy needed to recovery 100% will most likely be lacking.

##External Factors##
When choosing or tweaking a program, there will be many external factors beyond the lifter’s abilities and weaknesses.  Work or school schedule, known interruptions like vacations / business trips, moving apartments/homes, deaths in the family, etc. can certainly derail a lifter or the program’s planned progression.  While unplanned factors can’t always be expected or prevented, there are methods to mitigate their impact.  What can be prevented are known external factors such as work schedule or planned vacations.

###Expected Interruptions###
Known external factors such as a consistent work schedule or a planned vacation can certainly affect the appropriate training program to follow, but it is important to understand how.  If a trainee has a known vacation that will last one week, it would not make sense to start a program that relies on specific workouts (such as Smolov) when that will be interrupted.  Additionally, a program that follows something along the lines of weekly/monthly progression is less likely to be affected from a week off (such as 5/3/1 or Texas Method).  In those cases, the program can be started and after the seven days off, the lifter could simply try to repeat the last week or rollback a single week.  With programs like Starting Strength, missing a single workout will not make or break the program, despite the amount of posts and stress I’ve seen from such a situation.  
Another example might be planning to move apartments/houses, certainly a mental and physical drain.  In this case, I would most likely continue trying to train that week of moving, but condense the workout schedule and also be following a deload-week format so that weights are lighter and workouts are shorter.  Regardless, these types of known interruptions should be considered when picking a program and mitigated to the best to your ability.

###Unexpected Interruptions###
There will also be times when there are unexpected interruptions to a program and they can throw a wrench into a lifter’s program.  In some cases, the interruption may be short lived but if that’s not the case, the lifter will need to make the judgment call of either rolling back a week or two, deloading, or switching to a more appropriate program for the foreseeable future.  The important thing to realize here is not that the original program was wrong; it just was not suited for the new situation.  

So long as the trainee is training seriously, over the course of months or years, this one hiccup will not destroy a lifter’s potential; it’s simply a road bump in their strength journey.  Keeping this perspective in mind has done a great deal for me personally in minimizing the stress with training interruptions and I believe that has helped considerably.

##Experience##
The more experienced the lifter, the more adjustments and on-the-fly tweaks I believe the lifter can make without accidentally sabotaging a program.  A lifter with 5 years of training (serious training, not just occasionally going to the gym) will have a much larger experience-bank to draw from compared to a new lifter with say a couple months of training.  The experienced lifter can look back at previous training cycles or even previous years and know what did and what did not work for them personally, whereas a newer lifter has almost no personal experience to draw from, and using the experience of other lifters will most likely be incorrect to some degree due to personal variations between lifters (work schedule, sleep, nutrition, cutting/bulking, personal stress, specific weaknesses, etc.).  I firmly believe new lifters should not be designing their own programs and that more advanced lifters certainly can write their own programs.  I don’t believe in any hard numbers (ex “you must have 3 years of serious training first”) but it’s a gradient from unacceptable to acceptable/expected depending on the lifter.  

Similarly, a more advanced lifter is able to auto-regulate their training better.  For example, with missed reps, workouts, or weeks, the more advanced lifter will have a better idea on how to get back on track (retry a set, deload one week, repeat a week, etc.) based on what they have done in similar situations in the past.  I can’t count the number of times I’ve seen posts in either r/Fitness or r/Weightroom asking, “I missed a workout this week, what do?” and 9 out of 10 times, it’s a rather inexperienced lifter (who most of the time has not read the program manual/book/guide/etc. that describes exactly what to do, but I digress).

The answer is not simple, there is no single thing that causes the problem.  There are rather a number of factors, any one of which could be overcome by itself, but together they make it very difficult for us to win.

The first thing is the thing that everyone likes to talk about the most, the drug issue.  I am not going to say that it is impossible to make it to the podium drug free, or that people don't do that from time to time.  Hell we have had people like Hayworth, Knott, Chaplin, and Barnett make the podium in the last 15 years in the Olympics, World's and Junior Worlds.  Germany has a very strict drug testing program and they produce more ""A"" session lifters than us by far.  But, once you are ""in the club"" so to speak, people start talking to honestly about drug use, including foreign lifters and coaches.  There is no question that the countries that dominate in weightlifting are heavy into PED's, no question at all.  Among the right crowd, they admit it freely.  In fact they literally make fun of countries like the USA who attempt to compete without PED's.  No, USADA alone does not prevent us from winning.  But there is no question that an athlete subject to regular testing such as provided by USADA is competing at a disadvantage when facing lifters from some of the countries that are historically dominant.

The second issue is the talent pool.  Weightlifting in the USA simply does not pull enough of the really really gifted athletes.  We get a few of them, Wes Barnett is a great example.  Cheryl Hayworth is another example.  But if we want to make it to the podium consistently, we need 20 Wes Barnett's, and 20 Cheryl Hayworth's.  If we had 10 lifters in the 85kg class with the talent of Farris, it is very likely that the the stars would align for one of them, and we would see lifts that put someone on the podium, drug testing or no drug testing.  

The third issue is our culture, and this ties into why we don't draw, or retain enough people with top tier talent.  We, as a culture, simply do not idolize strength or weightlifting as much as they do in some parts of the world.  And, for those with great athletic talent, there are many, many other ways to display it that pay much greater dividends financially and also award the winners with more notoriety. And, we are a wealthy country.  That is great, but not great for weightlifting.  In some of the better weightlifting countries, becoming a great lifter puts you ahead in life, ahead of where you would be without weightlifting.  In the USA it is a sacrifice.  Think of how different the decision to continue is for two 20 year olds who just made the world team for the first time, one a poor kid from Guatemala, the other an middle class engineering student at a great college in the USA.  To continue to do well in weightlifting for the kid from Guatemala might be a way out of poverty, a route to international travel that he otherwise might never have had, an avenue for things so simple as having plenty of food...  For the US kid to attempt to stick with lifting means putting off his future, putting his education in jeopardy, delaying a good paying job, buying a house, having money to go to the lake on the weekends, etc.

You put these things together, and yes, they make it tough for us to win.  Given that everything else stayed the same, but USADA suddenly turned a 180 and started actively HELPING us cheat and beat the tests at international competitions, then yes, I think with the culture we have and the athletes we have today, we could be very, very competitive.

Or, given the exact same USADA we have now, but change the culture to one where weightlifting was a great choice for any athletically inclined kid, where it was often the best choice to fame and fortune, where a person could make a better life for himself or herself through weightlifting than they could without the sport, then yes, in that situation too, we could do very well.

But you put these things together, and I do not believe we will ever be a ""dominant"" country in the sport.  That does not mean we can not improve, in fact improve a lot.  Of course we can do better than we are doing now.  Of course we can find people like Cheryl Haworth here and there.  Of course we can offer better opportunites for lifters than we are now.  My company, MuscleDriverUSA, is right now paying monthly stipends for living expenses, and covering all competition and travel related costs for a group of 10 lifters, to allow them to train full time, this is a recent development and nothing like this has happened since the late 60's and early 70's.  But we, as a country can do better in a lot of ways.  All of us, lifters, coaches, private businesses, weightlifting fans...  we can all improve what we are doing to help us move up in the world rankings.

But, there are real road blocks.  To say that we just need to get stronger, as if it is that simple, is childish.  To say that we can't compete and get beat just because everyone else is on drugs is also childish.

I'm not as acidic as Jamie Lewis, but we can still have a good time. I'm about to ejaculate some facts all over your brain to give you some ideas for questions. **The TL;DR is that I run 70sBig.com and am a coach, a writer, a lifter, a nerd, and...shit.** 


I've run 70sBig.com for nearly three years; I'm a strength and conditioning coach and writer who teaches lifting technique and programming. I have written two intermediate strength training e-books (The Texas Method: Part 1 and The Texas Method: Advanced) and a fitness/S&amp;C book with professors Dr. Lon Kilgore and Dr. Michael Hartman called FIT. I also coach raw powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting. I've worked with nearly every population imaginable including Special Operations soldiers from every branch of the military (including international teams); football, track, baseball, basketball, softball, and swimming athletes; paraplegics and cancer survivors; obese and skinny folks; injured trainees requiring rehabilitation; CrossFitters, Olympic weightlifters, and raw powerlifters. I just handled six lifters that qualified for the Arnolds and one of them, Chris Riley, is the reigning North American Champion from this year's Arnold NAPF Raw Challenge. I've also coached some football and naturally learn things pretty fast and figure out a way to teach people about it. 


My general philosophy is just an old school mentaily: get strong with barbells and then use high intensity or sport specific conditioning. I am a practitioner who acquires information and makes sure it fits with a stress--&gt;recovery--&gt;adaptation concept within the confines of anatomy and physiology. My expertise probably lies within this ability to bring perspective in turning conceptual physiology stuff into application. I also study anatomy daily and regularly teach prehab (in the form of ""doing mobility"") and rehab (which pisses off a lot of PTs). But any thoughts or recommendations are always dependent on an individual, their training history, and their current state of adaptation. 


If you ask a question about your programming, I prefer to know more about you because PROGRAMMING ALWAYS DEPENDS. Sure, you can just ""listen to your body"" (whatever the fuck that means) and figure it out on your own, but there are a hundred ""right ways"" to make progress and only a few ways you can make optimal progress. Efficiency is key, because if we're gonna spend all of this time training or talking about training, then we sure as shit want to make the most out of our time. Let's get the desired adaptation with the lowest dose of stress -- otherwise we'll just drive our dicks into the ground (or burn the labia off --&gt; the female equivalent was requested at one of my seminars). Give your gender, age, ht/wt, body comp, current lifts, concise summary of recent program, and goals. I know you won't give me these things, but at least you'll know why I'll say ""but this fucking depends"". 


I played a variety of sports growing up, but really excelled at football by working really hard and not quitting on a play (I played linebacker). I played at a small, shitty place in college for one year. I really like football strategy, especially defenses, so if you want to talk about that, have at it. I competed in Olympic weightlifting for a bit and went to nationals in 2010. I don't currently train exclusively for a barbell sport; there are a lot of things that get in the way of training, including my hobbies. My training currently revolves around doing the Olympic lifts and strength lifts in between bouts of climbing mountains. I climbed a mountain last Saturday and then last night I went 125/155 on sn/cj (missed a 130 sn twice and cleaned 160 and 162.5 only to miss the jerks). 


I have been involved with CrossFit in the past and present. I was one of the youngest people to get their Level II (apparently this doesn't exist anymore?!??), I have run two facilities (including one that I started), and I was on staff with the CrossFit Basic Barbell Seminars when Mark Rippetoe did them. Most of my seminars are conducted in CrossFit gyms. 


As a side note, I agree with Jamie Lewis in that you guys spend a lot of time talking about the same shit over and over. Here are some other things I have done or are interested in to give you some material:


- I have a B.S. in Kinesiology, but I've spent thousands of hours studying 'stuff' since. One summer I spent at least 500 hours in a couple months studying and opening a CF gym (I had to log the hours). 
- I was a full time coach (at least 10 hours a day) for 18 months and would never do it again
- Some people that I enjoy learning from and talking to are Lon Kilgore, Glenn Pendlay, Michael Hartman, Shannon Green, as well as various lesser known coaches, lifters, or trainees
- I've done a case study on high intensity conditioning, inducing hypoxemia onto Dr. Kilgore that we don't get to talk about a lot. 
- Hobbies include reading (mostly sci-fi/fantasy/non-fiction), writing (trying to get better at fiction), hiking/adventuring, dog playing/training, shooting, and a few videogames
- I've read too many books to create a favorites list, so just start that convo and we'll roll with it
- I'm a Cleveland Browns fan
- I nerd the fuck out on anatomy stuff pretty often
- I've traveled around quite a bit doing seminars, including to Canada and Australia. I end up meeting people and therefore have friends all over the place
- I enjoy learning, and my primary method of doing that is to ask questions. I have the propensity to seek people out that are smarter than me and pick their brain. 
- I pull training ideas from everywhere for programming. I've pulled training ideas from communication books. 
- I studied sport psychology for a while and even was in a master's program. I employ sport psych stuff regularly on lifters, though most of the time it's not obvious. 
- I could write at least 100 pages on coaching and how I think about the coach/trainee interaction at various stages. 
- I have been around CrossFit HQ folks in depth, including having dinner with Greg Glassman 
- My username for videogames is ""ScroteScrote"" or ""MajorMajor""
- My friends are all pretty funny and unique
- I like guns. And knives. And adventuring. 
- One of my favorite sports to play nowadays is volleyball. 
- I really like Australian people
- I have big interest in the military special operations personnel and regularly work with them. 
- Don't get me started on exercise science research
- I've been told I'm pretty good at giving life advice (this outta be good). 



For real...ask me anything. While I'm pretty transparent, there are some topics that I won't discuss to maintain some semblence of privacy. 
Please don't make this shit boring.  I listen, learn, and apply well. And then I disseminate information and teach it to people. And I either make them laugh, weird them out, or piss them off so that they listen. I don't give advice or recommendations if I can't validate it with a clear, well thought-out line of reasoning. I'll admit when I'm wrong; I don't know everything. When I don't, I have friends that probably do. 


Lastly, I dedicate this AMA to Brent Kim's old glasses that he stereotypically taped together a long time ago like a shit head Asian.

1359858821.0,215,self.weightroom,17sbvl,Why You Should Be Doing More Pull Ups ,gzcl,273,58,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/17sbvl/why_you_should_be_doing_more_pull_ups/,"I’m sure many of you in this sub are already doing pull ups. If not, hopefully this post will convince you to. If you are, are you doing enough? Now you’re asking, “Well, what is enough?” That is the question I intend to answer with this post. No, there won’t be a long list of sources sprinkled throughout it- so if you’re the kind of lifter who requires “hard” science to support the reasons why you lift, in what ways, and all other things down to minutia then this post is not for you. This post is derived from observation, both of my own training and others’, and is merely a speculation as to why pull-ups should be an integral movement to any athlete’s training program.    

First, I will present a little anecdotal evidence. 

I started doing pull-ups, chin-ups, and all grip variations of bodyweight vertical pulling exercises back in early 2004 when I first became interested in joining the military.  Prior to that I had no gym or exercise experience outside of biking and skateboarding. When I first started doing pull-ups in earnest I could do one or two. After about a year of training the pull-up while waiting to leave for boot camp I was up to the high teens. While at boot camp that number surpassed 20. Why does this matter? 

Because it wasn’t until four years later that I started to deadlift- and just six months after occasionally doing the deadlift I pulled 405 pounds at a whopping 142 pounds bodyweight. That’s a full four years of training my back strength with pull-ups before I even tried the deadlift once. It is my belief that my pull-up strength directly benefitted my ability to deadlift. 

I didn’t start going to the gym until September of 2008, and like most new lifters I didn’t follow a program and thought I knew best. This meant my “program” included mostly more of what I was already good at- pull-ups.  I played around with squats and deadlifts for about six months, but never trained either of those movements consistently- never more than once a week at most. Even then “leg day” was mostly filled with machine usage, as I could not be bothered to actually learn a complicated lift such as the squat or deadlift. Six months into going to the gym regularly I pulled 405 on a whim. I hadn’t made any notable progress in any of my lifts besides bench press and pull-ups. The latter from the low 20’s to the upper 30’s for reps and 115 pounds added for weighted singles. 

The pull-up is key because it strengthens your latissimus dorsi, which originates in the lower back near the iliac crest and inserts at the humerus. That single muscle spans from glutes to traps and is primarily responsible for keeping your torso upright- well that and your abdominals, but everyone trains abs, right? Anyways, what I’m getting at is this- strong lats will make for a strong pull. And if you want to be strong you might want to put a lot of focus on the one muscle group that spans the entire length of your torso. I do however understand that not all exceptional deadlifters could bang out an exceptional amount of pull-ups. But my theory is this, being exceptional at pull-ups may very well make you an exceptional deadlifter. I’ll present the following as evidence of my position.

Benedikt Magnusson has stated, [“for upper back, I am a fan of pull-ups.”]( http://www.brotherhoodofiron.com/articles/interview-with-benedikt-magnussonworld-record-deadlift-holder) Perhaps some of you have seen [this video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=boLl8rGhJvE) of Konstantin Konstantinovs doing pull-ups. If those two monsters of men are doing pull-ups, especially Magnusson weighing in at nearly 400 pounds, then surely there is something to be said for its carry over to deadlifting ability. Those are just two examples of exemplary deadlifters who are also fans of the pull-up for developing back strength. I’m sure there are many other great deadlifters out there who are also fans of the pull up, [Matt Kroczaleski](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8874JYBIODQ) and [Jamie Lewis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaieUDOPnbY) immediately come to mind. I will let you find more evidence of the pull-ups inclusion in great lifters programming. 

How about the squat? What do you squeeze in order to get your back tight in preparation for a heavy squat? Your lats. Ever try a heavy squat without having your back tight? 

But how often should the pull up be trained? I’m confident in saying daily. Which is quite a bit more often than you could train the deadlift. The pull-up is great because if trained right it can be done with very little eccentric portion of the lift and therefore a lifters ability to recover from it is increased- much like that of the snatch and clean and jerk. This is important because delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is primarily caused by the eccentric portion of movements; and if a lifter can avoid soreness then the lifter can continue to lift regularly without being inhibited by it. Now of course doing eccentric-less weighted pull-ups is probably a bad idea. I’m not saying you should do that, but you could however program weighted pull-ups and bodyweight pull-ups into your weekly schedule. An example of such would be:

Day 1- Weighted X 5 X 5

Day 2- Bodyweight X Max Reps X 3 Sets

Add weight linearly. Repeat until you’re flying on wings of glory. 

As it stands right now I’m still training my pull-ups nearly every day in such a fashion. I do however switch out pull-ups for lightweight high rep lat pull downs if I’m feeling terribly sore. 

The idea of alternating the same movement in heavy/light days is very popular in the weightlifting community both because it allows the lifter to become more familiar with the movement and that the higher volume/ lower intensities on the following day tends to aid in recovery by pumping blood- and therefore oxygen and nutrients- into the damaged muscle group.  And as I’ve explained previously the pull-up can be trained nearly without an eccentric portion- if done right; it could then be theorized that the lift may be trained similarly to the snatch and clean and jerk. 

Not only that but it’s an excellent addition if you require extra grip work. Furthermore the added strength will help keep your upper back more upright while squatting and the added width will help create a more stable base which to bench press off of. Did I forget to mention that if you’re not using your lats while pressing you’re probably [doing it wrong?]( http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/are_you_ready_to_overhead_press)

[Here’s a great article from 70’s big]( http://70sbig.com/blog/2011/10/lats-while-benching/) on why having awesome lats are integral to having an awesome bench, and therefore being that much more awesome. 

I didn’t write this because I’m trying to speak from a position of authority or experience for being an excellent deadlifter, squatter, or bencher- because I’m not. There are far stronger and more experienced men on this forum than I who could write extensively about how to become better at those movements. I’ve only been doing the big three for a few years- at best. I am however speaking from a position of experience when it comes to pull-ups as I’ve been doing them near daily for almost a decade and am sure I have easily surpassed a half million reps of that one movement. 

That’s a lot of time hanging from a bar. 

**Edit:** I forgot to add an [interesting piece](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance_repair/lats_not_just_for_pulldowns;jsessionid=08D7E4D5ED927881621A52402F19857D-mcd02.hydra) about how sprint speed can be directly related to lat strength. Who doesn't want to run faster?

I mostly made this for people curious about crosstraining for MMA, which is a somewhat common question here. I'll probably also crosspost to /r/Fitness. Presumably, the folks at /r/MMA already know most of this.

I got into the sport around 2000 via kickboxing and then made a transition to more wrestling because I moved. I made it to a level you could probably consider pro-am (or at least that's what we were calling it) before a combination of a motorcycle wreck (lolMirMode) and school kept me from competing or training with any regularity. Now I've recently transitioned to full-time strength training but still keep up with the sport and help spar with/train fighters on occasion. So I guess this is partly me paying it forward and partly a bit of a goodbye to the sport the really defined my youth and made me who I am today.

**General Philosophy**

Now that that's out of the way, let's get into the actual training and the philosophy I have generally trained with. Because MMA is so diverse, it's almost impossible to create a cookie-cutter program for every fighter, and it would be silly to do so. Generally speaking, if you're weak in an area of the fight game, crosstraining in the associated sport will make you better. For instance, if your boxing sucks because of physical limitations (speed, endurance, etc), you should have a higher percentage of your crosstraining look like that of a boxer's. And that's just like any other sport, really. A running back's training program certainly isn't going to look like a noseguard's, but a weak RB may do more lifting.

In MMA training, there is a tendency to want to do everything. That's the reason a lot of fighters have started doing CrossFit (also some heavy marketing KoolAid). But training for CrossFit and training for fighting are two different things. If there's a CrossFit gym that's run and/or programmed by fighters (as in people who actually fight, not guys who roll an hour a week), then I would say that could be a good bet for MMA training unless they get too caught up in the macho ""fight through the injuries"" that's all too common in the fight game. Otherwise, you're probably better off training for your specific game or style, so that's how I'm going to break this down. Think of each of the following sections as modules you can plug into your training, depending on how many hours a week you want to spend and what your goals are.

One other caveat to this is that technique will almost always trump crosstraining. Your goal is to fight. If your fighting technique is poor, no one cares if you're the strongest human to ever step inside a ring. Similarly, if your strategy is nonexistent, crappy, or disappears the moment you eat a stiff jab, you should focus on that rather than crosstraining. Crosstraining exists to enhance your ability to execute the skills you know and the strategy you've set. If you lack skill, strategy, or both, you should spend more time in the ring or on the pads than in the gym.

**Special newbie lifter note**

If you have been training for less than about 2 years or have never done a strength program, just do Starting Strength or StrongLifts. They're not hard, and they're not a huge extra burden. You may stall earlier than someone who only lifts, but who cares? Lifting numbers aren't your goal if your main sport is MMA. But please do take into account the notes in the striking sections below.

If you're more experienced or have lifted weights before, a lot of people report good results from 5/3/1 or Texas Method if you need more raw strength or mass. But don't screw up your fighting goals chasing numbers.

Anyway, without further adieu, here are the ""modules"" as I think about them. This is way too long for a single post, so I've broken it up, which will probably make discussion (and telling me I'm a dumbass) easier too.

**Conclusion**

Pick your weakest ""module"" and focus on that. Or, alternatively, focus skill work on one module and crosstraining work on another, then switch them around. Alternatively, peruse the various sections and find the common exercises (suitcase carries, woodchoppers, lumberjack presses, power cleans, and front squats would probably make a good base program).

I hope this helps someone. It's most of what I've learned about crosstraining for MMA over my years of fighting. Good luck, kick ass, and most importantly, have fun.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1366810854.0,,,True,t3_1d0azc,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1d0azc/training_for_mma/,

Weigh-ins went on Thursday, November 8 at 9 a.m. and lifting began the following morning at the same time. (24 hour weigh-in hell yeah.) Now for the details.

**Training:**

My last powerlifting meet was in January and since then I had the idea in mind to do another meet in the fall of this year. However it wasn't until August or September that I decided on the IPL Worlds. Between January and this week my programming was mostly of my own design. The exception is my 5/3/1 mod with periodized accessory work, no deadlifts, and added squat work. Other than the two or three cycles I did of that everything was of my own design. 

My programming is built primarily around a structure resembling 5/3/1, just with much higher percentages, lower reps for primary movements always working up to three heavy singles then backing off to a prescribed percentage as my 1st tier accessory exercise. This 1st tier of accessory work would be higher in volume and lower intensity in the beginning of the cycle and vice versa at the end. After the 1st tier accessory work I would go to 2nd tier; and if I had energy 3rd tier. 

I could write an e-book on my training methodology so I'll end it here. If there is interest, I'll consider going more in depth about my training. It is however, my opinion, that what works well for one wont always create the same results for another. So really, how I train doesn't really matter (at least in my perspective). If any of you have questions about it and want a more detailed description just ask. 

**Dieting** (AKA, The Cut of all Cuts)

Back in late July and early August I was in the mid to low 170s. For this meet I had to diet down to around 160. I accomplished this by cutting carbs to around 100g per day on most days of the week with one cheat day or so per week. Once September rolled around I just made sure to eat less food over all and still keep an eye on my carbs. My mantra for this stage of the game is, ""Always be hungry."" If I was hungry for the majority of the day, I was doing it right. October 29th rolled around and I was around 160 and I had to kick my ass into gear. 

I did this by limiting my carbs to less than 50g per day every day until weigh-ins. As the day came nearer my carb consumption continued to lower. The Monday before weigh-ins I consumed 2g of carbs. 

**Water Cut**

I followed /u/NoMediocrity's methods detailed [here](http://ctrlaltlift.blogspot.com/2012/04/how-i-make-weight-for-2-hour-weigh-ins.html). Except I went against his advice of doing a carb and sodium load on the Friday prior to weigh-ins and just did a sodium load. (Sorry bro, I was carb phobic and was no shit afraid to eat them). This worked wonders and is very similar to the methods I used to make weight for my last meet. Sodium and water loading is the way to go. 

I didn't even have to hot bath, steam room, or sauna suit it... although I tried and ended up shorting out the lights in my hotel bathroom. Yeah, that was fun. Ended up making weight at a whopping 146.6 pounds. [Here is me, the night before weigh-ins, feeling like shit, but very lean and dehydrated. This is the leanest I've been, ever, and I estimate it to be around 7-8%.](http://imgur.com/a/SA2sn) 

Now for what you all care about.

**The Meet**

I'll just get to the gist of this.  

Squat 1: 375 

Squat 2: 397

Squat 3: 407

Bench 1: 248

Bench 2: 264

Bench 3: 275

Deadlift 1: 451

Deadlift 2: 485 

Deadlift 3: 512

Deadlift 4: 529 (4th attempt allowed for World Record Attempts)

I went 10/10 on all my lifts. Broke the California Mens Open deadlift record and total record. My Powerlifting total is 1,196 pounds counting only 3rd attempts, and with my 4th deadlift it is 1,211 pounds. The 529 pound deadlift is a new IPL World Record. 

**TLDR:** [Video of all my lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq4571kZqpA&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Overall, I'm very happy (to say the least) with my performance. I have nothing but the greatest things to say about the community of lifters who were there and the meet organizers. The USPA President, Steve Denison is a total professional and really knows how to get something awesome together. If you're considering competing... do it. Even if you wont put up record breaking lifts, the experience in itself is worth of showing up. Also, shout out to /u/failon and his brother for coming out there and meeting up with me. He's a fucking monster of a man and has a 10 lb brain when it comes to all things lifting and kinesiology. 

Now get out there and lift. 

**EDIT:** After some discussion with /u/MinimumROM I've decided that sometime this week I will be posting an entry about my training methodology. Keep an eye out for that. I hope it helps the subscribers of this fucking awesome subreddit.

My last competition was June 15th, RPS summerslam 2013. I compete at 242 raw currently, I'm 27, and my lifts were 625/485/645, giving me a 1755 total. I made attempts to get me into the 1800's on total and missed. I plan to compete at an upcoming XPC meet in October, hopefully I'll make it into the 1800's then. I don't follow any specific program, I do what works for me. It's a variation of heavy main lifts with bodybuilding/accessory days. I train 6 days a week with a good group of guys. I suppose the way I see it is someone may beat me due to genetics but not because of work ethic. Long term I plan to push my way into the 275 class and move some big weight, but I have at least 2 more competitions to do before I make the jump.

Calves

Now this is a very crude breakdown of my typical week. I will often switch certain exercises out for something similar between weeks depending on how I feel. I may switch slingshot work for board press, floor press, or really heavy close grip. I might do good mornings instead of straight leg stuff like that. I may do 10's instead of 5's on a moderate day, it all depends on how I personally feel that day. A big part of weight training is going to come from knowing your own body, what it can and can't do on a given day. This is amount of work isn't for everyone, I have one buddy that can only handle 5 days a week, and another that only does 4 although he lifts in multiply.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1373338951.0,,,True,t3_1hv8xs,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1hv8xs/flair_post_elite_powerlifting/,

About a year ago, after an argument with /u/monspubis, I finally got fed up with /r/fitness and vowed to create a better sub with a focus on lifting heavy shit. I was sick of the mediocrity that was celebrated on a daily basis and tired of so many lazy people posting the same bullshit over and over again. I wanted a place to keep learning. A place where intelligent discussion could thrive, and a place where people with similar interests could talk about shit, learn from eachothers mistakes, and reach actual goals.

A lot of people thought the idea was dumb and many said it was unnecessary. A handful said it was a good idea and offered to help me get this place going. /u/ecnosihtgnisu, /u/tanglisha, and /u/minimumROM came on from the start (thank you guys for helping me get this place going, I could not have done it without you all), joined later by /u/HeresWhyYouSuck and /u/troublesome to round the team out. They all work hard to keep this place both looking good and running well. I think now, 12 months later, we have proven that it was a change for the good. Things aren't perfect, the never will be, but overall I think we have done well. 

Obviously the mods didnt do all the work. We had a lot of help from the [Charter Members] getting content flowing, intelligent discussions happening, and really getting the sub off the ground. And every day we have good members submitting good content. 

**Things we have done in the last 12 months:**

* We have over 14K members. More and more of which are [competing in strength sports](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/search?q=meet+report&amp;restrict_sr=on), several are elite level competitors, strength coaches, and experts in the field.

* We have held a [Virtual Powerlifting Meet](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroomcontests/comments/q0kto/announcing_our_winners/), and even after a shitload of communication problems, found winners who, after months of delays, got some sweet prizes from Titan.

* We held a [widowmaker squat contest](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroomcontests/comments/xh9lu/results_for_the_2012_jesse_marunde_squat_contest/) in honor of Jesse Marunde - House of Pain and EliteEFT hooked us up with some prizes for these (EliteFTS stuff should be in the mail shortly)
 
* We have done a shitload of AMAs.

* Most importantly, we have created a place to discuss actual things related to lifting heavy shit. Yes, this place is harshly moderated. We remove ~20-30% of posts. That isn't changing. We will NOT allow posts where people were just too lazy to go look for answers. Period. 

So what is coming for the next 12 months? Easy. More contests. More AMAs. More hostile mods deleting posts we think are stupid (and Tanglisha + Troublesome generally being the nice guys to even out me being a total prick.)

1366962723.0,182,self.weightroom,1d54x7,My experience with the 5/3/1 BBB 3-Month Challenge &amp; the benefits of strength self-assessments,acconrad,221,39,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1d54x7/my_experience_with_the_531_bbb_3month_challenge/,"I recently milked the last of a Texas Method cycle to bring up my squat and needed something slightly less painful with more of a focus on hypertrophy to increase my bodyweight (which helps with a higher bench and squat). Being harshly competitive, I chose to do [The Boring But Big 3-Month Challenge](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/the_boring_but_big_3month_challenge). Except I did it in 9 weeks because my strength borders between Intermediate and Advanced (ExRx) and my recovery is great so I simply don't need back-off weeks. I followed the exercise selection and loading parameters to the tee and hit nearly all of my 5/3/1 numbers. I'd like to share a few anecdotes and observations from my personal training logs, with take-homes for your own improvement:

**The Program:**

* I hit all of my 5/3/1 sets, except for cycle 3, 5-rep week for overhead press. In fact, the general consensus was that 5-weeks were the hardest and 5/3/1 weeks were the easiest...so easy that if I had to do 415x1 in the deadlift, for example, that I would take a 4-5 min break and do another set, say 435x1. And I hit all of those. This is mostly because I purposely took Jim's advice of starting with 90% of my training 1RM, as to compensate for the additional hypertrophy load. Either way, I learned for myself that 1-3 rep ranges reflect my true strength more than 5RM, and 5RM tend to slightly underestimate my strength potential. **LESSON: know what rep ranges work for you, especially depending on your sport**.
* The actual ""3 Month Challenge"" part where your first accessory exercise reflects 50%, 60% and then 70% of your training 1RM was indeed a challenge. But I felt like it ramped up way too drastically. **Cycle 1 (50%)** felt way too easy so I purposely slowed it down bodybuilding style and went at a 40X0 pace (4 seconds down, no pause, explosive on the up). **Now I understand why bodybuilders get big on such light weights.** That was not an easy first cycle when you adhere to Time Under Tension guidelines. **Cycle 2 (60%)** was significantly harder. GVT recommends you choose your 10x10 weight based on 50% of your 1RM, and jumping up an additional 10% really screws up your ability to maintain a 40X0 tempo. I think for this cycle i was doing something more along the lines of 20X0, but got all of my reps, albeit with some huffing and puffing. **Cycle 3 (70%) was the real challenge**. Holy shit, you have to be some sort of golden boy to do 5x10 at 70% of your training max. I failed to hit get 50 reps on all 5 exercises. It generally went 10, 8, 6, 5, 5 reps going as fast as possible, no respect to bodybuilding pace. This was simply a fight for my life under the bar. This is exactly what I was speaking to earlier about the ramp up being too quick...in 3 transitions it went from ""let me make this harder"" to ""this isn't even feasible"". **LESSON: If an expert calls something a challenge, it definitely is if you're doing it right. Man up,  leave your ego at the door and see how well you can do.**
* Other accessory work from Wendler was optional, but I did all of the optional sets every week, and increased the weights every cycle. Because I could. **LESSON: Never stop pushing yourself...well I didn't learn that but accessory work should be pushed, not just your main lifts.**

So in the end, I added **7 lbs of bodyweight in 9 weeks and increased my bench/OHP by 15+ lbs and my squat/deadlift by 30 lbs**.

START (training maxes, not all-out maxes): 

198 lbs bw

175 OHP

265 Bench

340 squat

405 dead

FINISH** (training maxes, not including my 2nd, higher 1RM):

205 lbs bw

195 OHP

280 Bench

370 squat

435 deadlift 

** - I hit 290 in my bench, 390 in squat and 465 in the dead upon additional attempts.

**The Assessment:**

After completing the program I wanted to determine strength symmetry to see how balanced my strength was across my body and see if I could pinpoint any weaknesses that I could work on to further increase my strength numbers for future cycles, and more accurately dial in my accessory work. I chose [this comprehensive guide](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/how_much_can_you_lift_wimp) and based it off of my back squat, which I felt like was the best lift to base everything off of.

The guide says to base everything off of whatever rep max you used for your base exercise - so I decided to use my Cycle 3, 5-Rep Day target squat number as the basis because I found 5RM to be the hardest to grind out, and thus all of my other exercises would be based on a 5RM. Yes, I know that I stated earlier that 1-3 rep ranges more accurately portrayed my strength, but one limitation I have is that my gym only has DB up to 100 lbs, so I knew that I needed a universally higher rep range to limit the amount of exercises that would require above 100lb DBs.

As with the workout program, I made 1 major modification to the guideline percentages - **instead of a 140% deadlift, I chose a 125% deadlift**. I did this because much evidence in the powerlifting community points to a 3:4:5 bench:squat:deadlift ratio, especially for advances trainees, and 1.4-1.5x deadlift is more commonly seen in beginner/advanced trainees.

I also did the assessment on Cycle 3, Week 1 (5RM week) as a replacement for my accessory work. There are a ton of exercises, especially for upper body so my upper body days had loooong workouts so I imagine fatigue negatively affected many of the single-joint exercises, such as the calf-raises and concentration curls. I can confirm this because I actually didn't get a chance to do the EZ-bar Skull Crushers until Cycle 3, Week 2 and found my tricep strength to be much greater than it was the week before, especially because it was my first accessory exercise so I was fresh. I further confirmed this by doing a set of Tricep Pressdowns, which after re-assessment, was nearly 10 lbs stronger in a 1RM than the week before, mainly because it was my 2nd accessory lift on that day as opposed to the 5th accessory lift from the previous week.

**My personal assessment results: [for your viewing pleasure](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiJdKiUA9Rl9dDVQT1k1b09wbTRuU3RFUGNhUEtDcUE&amp;usp=sharing)**.

NOTE: I am aware that 3 exercises were not assessed. I plan on assessing them next week but due to work schedule and limited time for the gym, I simply didn't have the means to test them.

**EDIT: ON NUTRITION**

*Since that in itself is lengthy, I wrote a comment as an amendment to this post which you can find below*.

**CONCLUSION/FINDINGS:**

* My life as an anti-bench bro (strength mostly from non-mirror muscles) has left me with weak biceps as my most obvious glaring weakness. This was evident with direct curls but even pull ups - I'd get stuck 1/2 way up a pull-up, so my lats did most of the work but as soon as it was time for the biceps to take over I'd stall.
* Pretty good strength symmetry between the front and back of my body. However it's clear that much of my strength from my upper body is attributed to my pecs and lats. I never get stuck at the bottom of the bench or OHP because my pecs/lats get that first bit out, but I usually get stuck in the middle, which in both scenarios points to the actual shoulder muscles. This is further verified by the fact that I scored well on my tricep exercises, so shoulders are also another weakness.
* My actual 5RM for the Front Squat should have been 225, but on my final 5th rep my back caved in and I couldn't complete the rep. This usually points to a weak upper back and weak abs. I definitely neglect direct ab work or central upper-back strength.
* While I did fine with bulgarian split squats, I noticed that my left leg was primarily sore in the quads, while my right leg was primarily sore in my glutes. If done right, the BSS is a hip exercise, so clearly there is a muscular imbalance between my legs and my left glute is not firing properly.
* **WHAT I NEED FOR ASSISTANCE WORK:** lots of BB curls, lat/front raises, bench press from high pins, lots of heavy abs, seated safety bar good mornings, single leg hip thrusts, bulgarian split squats

***TL;DR:*** **Wendler's 5/3/1 BBB 3-Month Challenge is actually fucking hard - mostly because it starts out deceptively easy and ramps up incredibly quickly. 50% 5x10 is pretty easy, 70% 5x10 is impossible/insane.**

**Comprehensive strength assessments are crucial if you are a serious weight trainer because it will help you find your weak links so you can focus on bringing them up rather than waste time on the things you're already strong at.**

1368998224.0,164,self.weightroom,1eniff,Meet Report: 750-425-710 1885 (503.5 wilks) at 242 at the IPA NC Iron Challenge,gnuckols,191,27,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1eniff/meet_report_750425710_1885_5035_wilks_at_242_at/,"The training cycle:

After my meet last August, I took training fairly easy for about 4 months.  After a summer of daily maxing, I was ready for a little time off.  I still hit the gym regularly, but I messed around a lot, stayed well within my comfort zone, and took some time to mentally reboot.  When I came home for Christmas break, I resumed serious training again.  My lifts were essentially unchanged from August, but my body felt great and I was mentally fresh.

Most of my squat training basically boiled down to breaking rep maxes and paused squat maxes.  I did much more of my training low bar this time around than last time just to give it a shot.  It worked well but definitely beat my elbows up more than high bar.  I'd squat hard about 2 days a week, and get a bar on my back for some light work another 2 or 3.

My bench training was basically non-existent.  I did a fair amount of overhead work and benched maybe one or two days a week, but didn't focus on it.  My elbows simply couldn't take a lot of volume and frequency with all the low bar work.  I did a little 4 week Sheiko-ish cycle leading up to the meet and I think it helped.  425 was questionable paused when I was fresh 6 weeks out, and was super easy even after squatting at the meet.

Rack pulls helped my deadlift considerably.  When I miss deadlifts, it feels like my grip is going to go, my biceps are going to rip, and my traps are being torn off of my neck, not that the weight is actually too heavy for my back, hammies, and hips.  The rack pulls got all those tissues used to the heavy loads without hurting my strength off the floor at all.  645 was super rough at my last meet after doing most of my pulls from the floor or a low box, but after working from knee height and upper shins a lot this time around, 650 was a cake opener.

Other things that helped a lot were doing lunges and a lot of split stance work to keep my hip flexors long and strong.  Playing catch with a medicine ball in a bottom lunge position is great for strength strength, stability, and mobility.  Also, I did a ton of bodyweight glute bridges really focusing on getting my inactive left glute to fire.  It's not quite there yet, but is noticeably better than when I started.  A big thanks to Bret Contreras for the suggestion that I focus on symmetrical activation moreso than really heavy loading for my thrusts.  It certainly payed off.

The weight cut:

In December I was 225 when I found out Mash Elite was bringing a team to this meet.  The number one goal was to dominate the team competition.  The plan was for Travis to dominate at 220 and I'd take 242, so I had about 20 pounds of wiggle room with only about 16 weeks to go.  The highest I ever got was 245 so I wasn't planning on an intense cut.  Just to play it safe, I drank tons of water starting Sunday cut carbs on Wednesday, salt on Thursday, and stopped drinking except for a few sips on Thursday night.  My scale read 240 on Thursday night and 236.5 on Friday morning.  No sweat, right?  Except that when I showed up for weigh-ins, I was slightly over.  I guess my scale at home likes telling me I'm slim and sexy instead of telling me the right weight.  However, losing some clothes and taking a pee put me right on the money at 242.  More drama than I'd have liked, but nothing crazy.  Glad I played it safe and did a mini-cut.  I wasn't in the mood to go back home and sweat for a couple hours.

After that, Lyndsey, Caleb, and I dominated a Chinese buffet for about an hour, and later that evening I ate two pizza and the better part of a half gallon of ice cream.

The meet:

Squat:

Warmups felt great.  I'd only lifted with a monolift once before, so I took most of my warmups with the mono in the back to get a feel for it before I stepped on the platform.  Everything felt super deep and super easy.  All my warmups were paused for about 5-10 seconds so I could really open my hips up.  135, 225, 315, 405, 495 (belt on), 585, 635 (wraps on), show time.

Opener - 675:  A little drama.  Apparently I shrunk after they took my rack height.  They had to lower it for me to get it out, but once I did, there was never a question.  Paused it at the bottom for about a second so they could get a good look at my hip crease.  3 whites.  25 pound meet PR.

Second - 725:  Same deal with the rack height.  They forgot to change it on my sheet, but I asked about it before I tried to unrack it this time.  Smoke show.  3 whites.  75 pound meet PR.

Third - 750:  I thought about going higher after how 725 felt, but I was aiming for the record today, and I knew what I needed to squat to set myself up so I stuck with the plan.  Destoyed it.  Travis and Chris (both 800 pound raw squatters) told me I was good for 800 if I'd have wanted it, but leaving some weight on the platform was worth it because I knew 750 was what I needed to hit.

Bench:

My elbow was bugging me after the squat, but I had long enough to wait with the other flight benched that it had calmed down by the time I started warming up.  Everything moved well.  135, 225, 315, 365, 385, show time.

Opener - 405:  Easy.  3 Whites.

Second - 425:  Looked like my opener.  3 Whites. 6 pound meet PR.

Third - 435:  Also felt light, but I was shy with leg drive, so it dipped a little bit on the way up because it was a little lower than the groove I'm used to.  Still locked it out easy, but reds for the dip.  No lift.

Deadlift:

My back was a little tight and my left hip was a little sore going into deadlifts, but no more than they'd be after a day of school, so I wasn't concerned at all.  I just needed 710 (15 pounds below my PR) to break the all-time WR.  Since I had to pull with straps for all my training deadlifts I was a little leery about my grip, but that went away as I was pulling my warmups.  135, 225, 315, 405, 495, 585, show time.

Opener - 650:  Speed pull.  2 whites.  I got one red because I locked out my hips so hard one judge said the bar bounced off my hips like a clean pull, which it technically a hitch.  5 pound meet PR.

Second - 710:  Never a question.  I shuffled a foot while I was sitting it down so I was a little afraid they'd be nit picky about that, but they weren't.  3 whites.  65 pound meet PR.

Third - Passed.  I could have gone for a 1900 total, but I'll be at 242 for a while now, and I have much bigger totals to hit in this class so there was no need to pull again after I took the record.

Overall - New all-time WRs for both squat and total despite leaving some weight on the platform.  It was a solid 7 for 8 day with just one technical miscue.

Thanks:

First and foremost, a huge thanks to my fiance Lyndsey Ruble for being my voice of reason.  Before she started training with me, I was stranded with a total around 1450 for about 3 years due to repeated injuries.  In the last 2.5 years, she's kept me from hurting myself doing stupid stuff which has allowed me to improve my best meet total by almost 450 in that time frame.  I honestly don't know what I'd do without her.  Also, she hit her first 300 deadlift like a joke last week (I like bragging on her):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDNkQyKRoU0

Thanks to Travis for everything he's taught me about lifting and the opportunity he's given me to work and train at the best gym in the country.  Thanks to Steve Maxon for putting on a great meet.  Thanks to Ryan Coplen of Rhino Fitness for not minding that I bend all his bars when I'm at school.

Miscellaneous stories from the day:

I saw a 780 geared bench that was stupidly impressive.  They used the same bar for everyone's benches, so it was fine for me and all the other raw guys, but it was shaking in his hands like a leaf in the wind.  Still smoked it at a jacked 275.

After my third deadlift, I totally slipped and fell on my face.  I got baby powder on the bottom of my already-slick slippers.  It was fine on the carpeted platform, but after I jumped on Travis, I dropped down and my feet slipped right out from under me on the concrete floor.  My last deadlift was the only lift of the day I wasn't relaxed and cracking jokes for, so it was a fitting way to bring some levity so the situation and bring me back to reality.

In the video for the meet, I wanted to get my good friend Caleb Tilson on camera.  He's a champion, and his very existence is a huge ""screw you"" to everyone who complains about not accomplishing things because of bad genetics.  He had about an 8 inch vertical and folded under a 95 pound squat the first time he tried (literally), and by sheer will and hard work he made university nationals in OL, pulled triple bodyweight, and is a couple tenths away on his 40 yard dash from making the Olympic bobsled team.  It's an awkward video, but we're both sort of awkward people so it's fitting.

The legendary Mark Chaillet was the one who gave me my drug test.  As we're walking to the bathroom, I asked him if he was adamant about actually watching me pee or not.  His response:  ""Nah, I'm not that f***ing crazy about it.  Besides, you don't need a f***ing drug test anyways; you're fat enough that I can tell you don't use anything, but it's the rules.""  I got a compliment and a burn in the same sentence; I feel strangely honored.  I asked him what training advice he had.  The two things:  get stronger abs (always good advice), and only train squat, bench, and deadlift once every 3 weeks.  I was pretty perplexed by the second bit, but he told I could email him if I had any more questions, so I plan on doing that within the next couple of days because I thought it was intriguing, and it clearly worked for him (he was a 900+ deadlifter).

As you may or may not know, Boris Sheiko, Russian coach extraordinaire, has recently released a new book, titled Пауэрлифтинг: от новичка до мастера (Powerlifting: from the newbie to the master). I found out about the book from this post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1eddl3/new_book_by_sheiko/ (Thanks, Aagr14).

But more to the point. I now have a copy in my possession. It's a [very nice looking book](http://i.imgur.com/CHhjenB.jpg) and about 500 pages long. I intend to translate it. However, I would like /r/weightroom's help. I have translated the introduction and posted it below. It breaks down the book chapter by chapter and gives a short summary of what each chapter is about. While every chapter is interesting (and very well written, I must say), some will no doubt be more interesting than others. Here's what I ask: read the introduction, then let me know what section or chapter you are most interested in. I will take everyone's suggestions into consideration and begin translating the proper sections. Obviously, I will not wait until the entire project is finished to release parts of it. As every section is finished, I will post it in /r/weightroom -- assuming the mods have no problem with this.

For the record, numbers in brackets in the text below denote page numbers. The text also references photos and video stills. When these are relevant, I will provide them.

*Translator's note:* Though there is no substitution for reading a work in the original, I will attempt to translate not only the facts of the book, but also Sheiko's tone. If you have a problem, concern or suggestion on a particular tract, please don't hestitate to send me a message. While I am taking great care to translate everything properly, sometimes there may be ways to more eloquently phrase a particular sentence. If you care very strongly, do let me know, but do keep in mind that I am balancing Sheiko's original author intent, general English readability, and the speed of the translation itself.

-----------------------------------------------------------

**Without further ado, the introduction:** (Emphasis mine to facilitate voting)

One of the most important and effective ways of strengthening health and character, historically and in all cultures, has been and remains the practice of physical culture and sport. Powerlifting is a new type of sport, which appeared outside of Russia near the end of the 40s, beginning of the 50s, in the 20th century. It arrived in Russia even later, and today powerlifting is spreading dynamically throughout the entire world.

During the study of sports training as a means of achieving maximum athlete potential, scientific-methodological literature has isolated relatively independent structures of preparation: technical, physical, tactical, mental and integrated [104, 135, 144]. The contents of the following work [1, 11, 21, 31, 43, 122, 124, 134, 155, 162, 176, 185, 194, 218, 227, 289] have to do with the terminology of athletic types of sport, the choosing of the most effective methods of teaching the technical aspects of competition movements and the development of physical qualities, planning, control and accounting for training and competition stresses, and so on. However, the scientific-methodological security of the teaching-training process in this kind of sport remains underdeveloped. There is a lack of objective instrumental data about the biomechanic structures of training and competition exercises, as well as scientifically grounded recommendations on the use of specific methods in the training process of powerlifters. All the material in this monograph is split into sections of ten main chapters. 

The **first chapter** tells of the history and birth of powerlifting in the world, Europe and Russia, restores the interrupted link of the times, revives the continuity of present and past culture, and returns tens of sport figure names to the modern age.

The **second chapter** deals with terminology. Many words and phrases are of foreign origin, since powerlifting came to us from across our border. Authors did not create new terms or substitute understanding. They just systematized that which already existed in the scientific methodological sport literature of powerlifting.

The **third chapter** describes base theories and the scientific basics of the training process and introduces the classification of competition exercises performed in the process of training.

Once the reader gets acquainted with the **fourth chapter**, they will know what role the cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous system play in the process of training, since during intense physical stress there is an exchange of substances in the body. The reader will also learn how excretory functions work and what role hormones play during this process, as well as how a person’s motor processes is based off of their body’s somatotype and constitutional psychology. In addition to everything listed, the chapter looks at the work of the main muscle groups during competition exercises, as well as other physiological questions.
	
The material in the **fifth chapter** acquaints readers with the general understanding of technique in powerlifting and the phase structure of competition exercises and their periodization. The chapter presents, for the first time, biomechanic video analysis of the competition exercises, done by powerlifter athletes at the highest tier of their sport. Their technique for every form of the competition exercises is analyzed with the use of video.
	
The **sixth chapter** devotes the greatest amount of time to errors made during the practice of competition exercises, as well as factors that contribute toward these errors and methods to eliminate them. The materials in the chapter have clearly differentiated characteristics. The chapter develops and concretizes general principles of teaching beginning athletes.
	
From the **seventh chapter**, you can get information about powerlifter gear and the companies that produce the specialized clothes and footwear. Examples of bench shirts, squat suits and deadlifting suits, as well as knee wraps, straps and other gear are given in the chapter, with many photographs provided.
	
The **eight and ninth chapters** discuss methodologies to train athletes at different levels of experience. Examples of training programs for athletes are provided as well.
	
In the **tenth chapter**, readers will learn about proper eating for athletes and methods for recovery.
	
In this way, the authors of this monograph have laid out the material that will help readers creatively and practically approach the building of a training process, using primarily new information. Methodologies of training processes are recommended as well.
	
Scientific and methodological works of both domestic and foreign authors that study strength sports were used during the work on this monograph. Data from scientific studies, conducted at the department of theory and methodologies of resistance training, boxing and fencing at the Bashkirov Institute of Physical Education was used as well. The general experience of leading coaches and strong athletes of the Republic of Bashkorostan and Russia was used as well.
	
Chapters one and two are written by the esteemed Russian trainer B. I. Sheiko with the doctor of education, professor and esteemed Russian trainer P. S. Gorylev.
	
The materials of the fourth chapter (4.1 – 4.9) were prepared by the doctor of biological sciences, Professor E. R. Rymancheva. The materials in chapter 3, 5 through 9 and chapter 4.10 are written by the esteemed trainer of Russia, B. I. Sheiko.
	
The materials of the tenth chapter were prepared by R. A. Chedovym.
	
The authors of the monograph “Powerlifting” give special thanks to the doctor of education sciences, Professor G. P. Vinogradov and to the doctor of educational sciences, Professor A. V. Samsonovoi. Without their highly professional competency, the monograph could not have been completed. 
	
Special appreciation to the doctor of technical sciences, Professor S. V. Fetisov, who took it upon himself to analyze the complicated biomechanic systems exhibited during the competition exercises of powerlifting, and also to the senior lecturer of the Bashkirov Institute, E. V. Ohlieva for providing over 500 photographs.

We are using what most of you call the ""Texas Method"" programming.  This program is a bit unique in that it came directly from lifters, not from the mind of any coach.  Back in the early 2000's, around 2003 roughly, I was using a program of multiple sets of 5, done 3 days a week for a group of maybe 20 or so weightlifters.  They did this on top of a significant volume snatches and clean and jerks, and, it worked pretty well.  It was a lot of hard work, but it was getting results.  But, by Friday, after a week of lots of hard work, it was pretty hard to motivate guys to go to the squat rack at the end of their workouts and plow through 3-5 sets of 5 reps on the squat.  I had a few lifters try to bargain with me, asking me to let them try to hit a PR set of 5 for a single set.  The bargain was that if they set a new PR, they didnt have to do the rest of the workout.  If they failed, they had to go ahead and do the whole workout.  Shankle was one of the guys in on this, he never liked to do multiple sets of 5.  I agreed to let a few of them do that, after all, if they could make a PR then that is a good thing, right?  Well, the guys who were doing this, as the weeks went by, started ""cheating"" on Wednesday.  Yeah, they would work hard on Mondays squatting, but on Wednesday, they were doing anything they could get away with to lighten the load.  Skipping sets, doing their sets with a bit less weight, anything they thought I would not notice to lighten the wednesday workload, and ""rest up"" for Friday, in hopes of making a new PR and not having to do the full workout.

Well, I noticed more than they thought I did, and one thing that I noticed was that the guys who were ""modifying"" their training like this were making more gains than the guys who did the whole workout.

So, I just went with it and had everyone do it, and, it worked really well.  And eventually it got named the ""Texas Method"" and now it is pretty widely used it seems.

So, this is the basic plan Kaleb is on.  He does 3 sets of 5 with a moderate weight on Monday, front squats on Wednesday, and does his maximal set, his attempt at a PR, on Saturday.  The real key is how you adjust your Monday weight and volume in comparison to your PR day, which for us is Saturday.  Kaleb started this workout about 6 weeks ago, and was doing 440lbs for 3 sets of 5 on Monday, front squatting on Wednesday, and was actually doing 462lbs for 2 sets of 5 on Saturday.  He wasn't quite ready to attempt a single set PR on Saturday to begin with.  For the first 4 weeks, I felt the volume on Monday was what was driving his progress.  He went from 440, to 451, to 462 to 473 on his 3 sets of 5 on monday, still below his best ever single set  During this time his PR day went from 462lbs for 2 sets, to 473 for 2 sets, to a single set with 486lbs (a new PR) to 502lbs for a single set, also a new PR.  At this point, the Monday work was getting so heavy I felt it was starting to drag him back.  Keep in mind that Mondays squats are done at the end of the day, after 2 sessions of snatch/clean and jerk, so the same weight is relatively harder.  So for the next two weeks, I backed Mondays weights off to 462lbs for 3 sets, and kept it there.  This allowed Kaleb to be a bit more recovered, and to do 517lbs then 529lbs for his PR set on Saturday the last two weeks.

Hopefully this is a good demonstration of how the different days interact with each other when using this training method, and how they interact with the other training you are doing if you are training for a sport.  Justin Lascek is probably the current best ""authority"" on this training method, he has two great e-books on his site that are a great guide to using it successfully.   

Here is a link to the video of Kaleb's latest PR, 240kg or 529lbs for a set of 5:

Overall, if you're a novice like me, I highly recommend finding a local strength gym and doing a session. There's an upper limit to what you can learn on the Internet, even a place as information-rich as r/weightroom. And it's a great opportunity to support a local business.

My situation: Starting Strength for a few months, weight started getting heavier, I started plateauing and suspected it was due to poor technique rather than exhausting my ability to adapt workout-to-workout.

I wound up going with [Supreme Sports Performance and Training] (http://www.yelp.com/biz/supreme-sports-performance-and-training-rockville) in Rockville, MD and did a session with a professional powerlifter.

It was incredibly valuable. There really is no substitute for a trained professional being there with you live to help you tweak your form and give you tips back on your height, weight, flexibility, etc. I never did sports in school, so this was even more valuable for my weak ass. I wish I'd done this a few months ago when I was just starting out.

Gym: Cool to go to a real strength training gym. Professional cages, plates, all sorts of righteous equipment packed into an efficient space. No treadmills, no ellipticals, nobody trying to sell me stuff I don't need.

Training: We went through a lot of different cues and found ones that worked for me. We also went over video of my lifts right after I completed them. Like a lot of novice lifters, I’m struggling to build up the muscle memory that leads to good, automatic form that only comes from many hours of training.

Squat: I was having trouble keeping my wrists locked throughout the lift. Part of that stems from my squid-like physiology. But the coach also told me Rippetoe tends to recommend a lower bar position than one that would work for me. We found a higher position that hit my “shelf.” My squats felt so much more comfortable. I might want to get wrist straps going forward. We also talked about treating each squat like its own mini-set. I needed to take more time to focus and maintain form between each rep. I was making the mistake of trying to “finish” the set rather than properly complete it. The coach had me count off “1-1000, 2-1000” between reps to reset. Another fix included an alternate to “chest up.” When most people hear that, including me, they think “puff your chest out,” but that can cause you to arch your lower back. What’s more helpful for me is to picture how your traps contract when you do a lat pulldown. This worked well with another cue: “break the bar over your back.”

Deadlift: Learned to get tense before the lift and close the small gap between the bar and the plates BEFORE starting the lift. Failing to do so had been causing me to let my hips get ahead of my arms and back. They also emphasized speed in getting the bar up.

Bench: I was way off here, letting the bar hit me too high on the way down and letting my wrists flail out like a squid on the way up. I also had a lot of trouble flexing my back muscles in and down instead of shrugging up. Again, a muscle memory thing that will come with time.

Didn’t have time to go over the press or powerclean. I suspect I’ll be back in a few months. (My comfort level with the press is higher and I've been using Pendlay Rows instead of powercleans.)

I would also say all in all it was well worth it. And for other novice lifters, think about how many hours you're going to spend watching, posting and reviewing form videos versus what you can get from 1-2 hours with a coach at a local gym.

9/9, not a single red light, 2 all-time PRs, lowest I’ve weighed for the 132s, all-time meet PR regardless of weight, Wilks PR, coached a good friend’s first PL meet (she hit around a 340 Wilks like a boss).  Before going into the details, this was pretty much the best meet I could have ever asked for and then some.

##Thanks##

I would like to thank two people in particular, without you two this meet wouldn’t have happened the way it did and for your support and friendship I am extremely grateful,

* gzcl - for always being there to discuss training, validate me or rightfully call me a complete idiot, push me to be better, and always keeping it real.  We give each other shit all the time, but it's always in good fun to push each other to be better than the day before.  Total bromance goin on.
* smoftie - for doing your first meet like a boss, letting me crash at your place and hauling my farting-ass around, listening to my coaching to the T, and being an awesome person, even if you do go full-tard too often.

##Pre-Meet##

Between the San Jose Open I did back in October and this meet, I injured my shoulder and strained my abs, both in one week back in late-Novemeber.  I took a bit over a month off with zero lifting and got back into it in January.  From there, I really didn’t have a program, but it wasn’t fucking around either – just listening to my body and attempting to make smart work-set selections each week.  **That's right, I did my own thing and didn't follow a program, gasp**.  For bench, that meant hitting a 5 lb single rep heavier than the week before, doing a couple sets of 8-10 reps at around 135, and then going home.  For deadlift, **I trained sumo and then pulled a conventional PR in competition**, so sumo will be staying in my training, most likely a 2:1 ratio (pull sumo for 2 weeks, then conventional).  Squat was a bit trickier.  I knew the 123 raw record for USAPL was 385 and I knew I could hit that, but when I started to have my eye on it, I started going a bit heavier too soon or doing extra work-sets, so I realized I needed to just recover and not push too hard, so I decided not to cut to 123s and lift as a 132er.

##Dat Der Meet##

This was a pretty large meet, nearly 110 lifters, spread across two platforms and four flights apiece.  I was in flight C and the friend I was coaching was in flight A, which was absolutely perfect.  This allowed me to focus on her during her flight and her warm-ups (while flight D went) and then switch to my warm-ups and my lifts during the other flights, so I couldn’t have asked for better scheduling in that regard.

###Squats###

My squat warm-ups were pretty standard, but when I hit my last warm-up at 335 lbs, it was a very awkward lift and much harder than it should have been.  This got me all worked up and nervous as I thought of every reason why it could have gone poorly.  Eventually I realized I wrapped my thumbs under the bar (seems to help alleviate some elbow issues) and I don’t do it too often, so I felt like that might have been the cause.  I decided to basically say fuck it and keep my thumb over the bar and deal with any elbow pain a bit later.

Squat opener at 165 kg / 363 lbs flew up pretty fast and felt good, no elbow pain either.  3 white lights, and then I put myself down for a solid 175 kg / 385 lbs as a second attempt.  That one felt a bit heavier on the walk-out, but the rep itself was still pretty fluid and way faster than I was expecting so with that in mind, I said fuck it all, we’re going to PR territory and put down 185 kg / 407.9 lbs as my third attempt.  I visualized the lift several times before doing it, tried to treat it just like any other lift, and then crushed that shit.  All-time PR in the books and 3.2xBW squat given 3 white lights by USAPL judges … so far so good.

###Bench###

Bench was tricky beast, as I knew I didn’t have much training with it since November, so I decided to go light and play it by ear.  Initially I was planning 198/209/220, but after a ridiculously easy 198, I put down 97.5 kg / 214 lbs as my second attempt, so that I could either make a small nudge to 220 or a bit higher if it felt good.  After the second attempt (another set of 3 white lights), I realized 220 was going to happen without a problem, so I decided 226 would be better (231 probably wasn’t going to go, plus that would be 16 lbs heavier than anything I’ve done since the injury).  226 was slow, but it never crossed my mind that I wouldn’t get the lift, just had to be patient with it.

###Deadlifts###

Deadlift warm-ups initially felt a little heavy, but after I got into lmao3plate territory, things started to feel a bit faster.  In the last month, I changed up my form a bit to have the bar an inch further in front of me than normal, allowing me to get an extremely small roll with the bar to engage my lats and load the hamstrings.  I don’t know if that’s really helped, but it feels nice and prevents me from taking forever to just pull the bar.  187.5 kg / 413 lbs stupidly easy, like all my deadlift openers have been.  I went to 197.5kg / 435 lbs because that would put me in a good spot to go either 205 or 207.5 kg.  My second deadlift felt heavy, but I watched it on video before putting in my third attempt.  When I saw how well it went up, 207.5 kg was immediately put on my attempt card.

At this point, I was 8 for 8, not a single red light, hit an all-time squat PR, was on track with all my goals (actually, ahead on squat and bench), the good friend I was coaching went 8/9 and hit a 340ish Wilks in her first meet, my old college coach was lifting in the next flight doing pretty well, and I had lifted at this meet 3 years ago as my first full meet.  Since that meet three years ago, I graduated, got a nice job doing software engineering, travelled to compete in meets, actually started coaching someone for *their* first meet, started a website for tracking training progress, and so on.  To sum up the next several minutes, I got a massive falcon punch to the feels and I pulled some things from deep down in me when I stepped up to that platform and made that weight mine.  That secured a second all-time PR in this meet, gave me a Wilks PR, total PR, etc.  I gave a good first pump on seeing 3 white lights and walked back to my chair to grab my stuff, with watery eyes as I thought about everything I’ve accomplished in the last three years and what I can do in the next three.

##Post-Meet##

My next meet will be USAPL Raw Nationals in July so long as I’m not injured, haha.  After that, I have no idea what my next meet would be.  Maybe IPL Worlds if gzcl does it, or 2014 Arnolds, I don’t know.  I have a good idea of what I would like to do for my next training cycle and how it will be structured.  I won’t really go into detail here (though I have mentioned it to I think two or three people in total) because I find I do better if I use a, “do first, talk later” approach and I want to make sure that I bring my A-game at Raw Nationals, this was just a dress rehearsal.  I will say that I will be incorporating direct hypertrophy training and actual conditioning and mobility specific days.

**tl;dr** – manlet lifts some weights, and has pretty much the best meet he could have ever asked for and then some.

1336786217.0,135,self.weightroom,tj2q9,A better lifting anatomy book,70sBig,158,23,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/tj2q9/a_better_lifting_anatomy_book/,"Hello /weightlifting, 

I run 70sBig.com and am an avid redditor, but my alter ego avoids lifting/fitness sub-reddits. I hope to be involved here in the future, if you'll have me. 

I was reviewing the FAQ to see that Delavier's ""Strength Training Anatomy, 3rd Ed."" is the recommended anatomy source. As someone who has spent a long time studying anatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and human movement, there is a special place in my heart reserved for the hate I have for Delavier's 'anatomy' book. 

Sure, the book has some hot chicks (they have big boobs and tight clothes), but they are still cartoons (I know some of you are into that, but stay focused). More importantly, it's a poor substitute for any relevant analysis of muscular involvement in lifting as well as -- and more importantly -- diagnosing and treating minor to medium grade injuries. 

I explain why anatomy is important for a lifter's mobility [HERE](http://www.70sbig.com/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/), but in that post I point out my favorite muscoskeletal anatomy book: [""Trail Guide to the Body, 3rd Ed.""](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=trail+guide+to+the+body+3rd+edition) by Andrew Biel. This book is beautifully drawn (far better than Grey's Anatomy) and teaches you how to palpate each bony or muscular structure. This is incredibly important for practically applying anatomical knowledge; most often it can assist in identifying a sore or injured structure and subsequently give you information on how to heal it (by using the list of actions that muscle is involved with). 

I had to get this book for school, and it's the only book that I've consistently used since then. Just last week I opened it up to remind myself of the thoracolumbar aponeurosis (the connective tissue that the lats and erectors integrate with -- if those muscle groupings are tight, it can provide tension on the sacrum and encourage low back pain or injuries). There is a 4th edition to the book out now, but you can still find the 3rd edition for under $25 (I recently bought a second copy for $13). Make sure you get the TEXT BOOK, because the work book isn't the same thing. 

Another excellent book, written by my friend Dr. Lon Kilgore, is [""Anatomy Without A Scalpel: A friendly hands-on guide for coaches and fitness professionals""](http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Without-Scalpel-Dr-Kilgore/dp/0615390722). This still is a reference book, but not as good as one as ""Trail Guide"". It's more of a resource to teach you about anatomy and how it relates to actual human movement. I realize that it would seem Delavier or the standard anatomy guide you have does that...but just trust me, they don't. They aren't even kindergarten or pre-school. They are like a short, thick-nosed neanderthal who just realized he can pull his hair back to style himself while ""Trail Guide"" or ""AWOS"" are like the future alien civilization who is traveling back in time to vaporize citizens of Earth who are ignorant of anatomy. If you have questions on these books, let me know. 

**TL;DR**

Delavier's anatomy book sucks the big one. Please try [""Trail Guide to the Body""](http://www.70sbig.com/blog/2012/04/why-anatomy-is-important/) (best musculoskeletal anatomy reference and learning how to palpate) or [""Anatomy Without a Scalpel""](http://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Without-Scalpel-Dr-Kilgore/dp/0615390722) (teaches comprehensive anatomy and how it relates to movement).

Enjoy. 

Now for the lifts:

Squat- 385 (3 Whites), 407 (3 Whites), 425 (3 Reds)

Bench- 265 (3 Whites), 275 (3 Whites), 282 (3 Reds)

Deadlift- 485 (3 Whites), 518 (3 Whites), 535 (3 Reds)

Powerlifting Total- 1,200

Here's the deal- I missed weight, by two pounds. There was no way another two was coming out of me. On January 7th I was 170 lb and when I stepped on the scale on January 19th I was 150.8 and felt like death. A good friend of mine called it when he said my recent relocation in December was going to throw me off and he was right- so screw him for being right. 

By why did I miss weight? Well, there's a whole list of reasons which contributed to that failure but my stand on the issue is this- *I lost focus.* That's reality. I lost focus of the fact that if I want to train at an elite level and compete at an elite level **I also have to eat at an elite leve.** That's the fact people. There's no way around it. That is unless you're a SHW then I suppose it doesn't really matter. 

Here's what the majority of my diet was like until January 7th:

In n Out double double animal style with animal fries and mexican food. 

And beer... glorious beer. 

Here's what the majority of diet will be like from now on: 

Monday-Saturday: Beef and green vegetables- most likely meatloaf and broccoli throughout the day and then a chicken dish at night. Then I will carb up on Sunday with 2-300g of carbs (aka cheat day). 

I *have* to put my mouth in check. 

My training leading up to the meet was a four-week cycle of my basic template. 

3 reps  @ 85%
2 reps, 2 sets @ 87.5%
1 rep, 3 sets @ 90%

Increase the percentages each week by 2.5% for each. 

Squat on Monday and Friday, bench Tuesday and Thursday, deadlift Wednesday. On the 2nd training day for both squat and bench I’ll usually rep out my last single.  After those 1st tier lifts are complete I’ll back off to some lower weight with higher reps with that movement for my 2nd tier (or very similar movement, such as close grip bench instead of regular grip). After that bang out some 3rd tier assistance work with significantly higher reps. Greater details on my training methods can be read in the .pdf link and linked /r/weightroom post below.

Followed up with a three-week peaking cycle where I did 15+ singles with 85-90% of my 1RM one day of the week for each lift and then 10-15 triples with 75-85% of my 1RM the other training day of the week (for squat and bench.) After that stuff I’d back way off the intensities and work on a mid volume low weight assistance exercise. 

Now for the reason why I have three missed lifts. Plain and simple- **I wasn't strong enough.** 

""Well duh, idiot.""

But here's why: 

- *I ignored technique errors in my squat for consistent increases in volume and intensity*

- *I ignored the weakness on my bench, which has always always been the lockout, in order to get better at what I was already good at- off the chest.*

- *I knew my deadlift lockout was weak and did absolutely nothing about it.*

What I plan to do about it:

- Take a minor de-load on my squat. Focus on keeping my knees out. Increase training volume in order to combat poor movement patterning more quickly while ensuring I maintain better form. This may require slightly I adjust my current training methodology temporarily. Work on mid-top end strength.  I’m also going to be including front and high bar squats a little more often. ([Detailed here](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13n0j5/the_gzcl_method_for_powerlifting/) and [here **warning .pdf](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/95027848/GZCLBible.pdf)) 

- Blast the hell out of my triceps strength. I missed this weight last year at the Camp Pendleton Open (my first powerlifting meet) and it is the only lift of mine which hasn't gone up 25+ pounds; or really at all for that matter. Floor presses and weighted dips will be stapels of my training for bench assistance work. I have to develop the top end of this lift. I know a 300 pound bench is within my grasp this year. 

- Work on my glute and lower back strength. On that 535 deadlift from the floor to just above my knees flew up. But once it came to locking the thing out- nothing. It got red lighted for hitching; some may disagree with the judges. But that doesn’t matter. What matters is how I’m going to deadlift 600+ as a 148’er. I’m going to start doing some deadlifts with a pause just below the knee (Ala Ben Rice style. Per recommendation from /u/NoMediocrity) and also do some barbell glute bridges. With my glute development work I’m going to continue bulletproofing my lower back with deficit deads, GHRs (weighted), reverse hyperextensions, and back extensions. My lower back wont be strong enough until it can single handedly defeat a Marine rifle squad. 

I'm also going to be training as much as I can with Matt Reep (#3 American 165 lb bencher with a 381 raw bench and 1,323 total ranked #17), Joseph Mundo (462 bench @242 ranked #27 bench) and David Douglas (Closing on a 600 lb raw bench @308).  I was invited to come train up at Orange County Strength Club, of which I am grateful for and will be doing as often as possible. I look forward to getting stronger with the lifters up there. 

Overall, I’m satisfied with my performance in the fact that I bettered my powerlifting total from 1,196 to 1,200 (My 1,211 counts a 4th attempt which generally isn’t accepted as a “powerlifting total.”) Now, that four pound increase on my total is pretty much negated by my four-pound increase in my body weight.  I came into this meet slightly stronger than I was at IPL Worlds and it really showed me that I’m very capable of having a 1,300 pound total in the next year or so. I also won the 165 pound weight class by default as there were no other competitors who showed up. 

The meet itself ran very smooth and had very little loader and/or spotter error. The judging was generally fair, and as usual, the USPA put on an excellent show and exemplified true professionalism in the sport of powerlifting. 

Special thanks to /u/NoMediocrity, /u/super_luminal for coming out to see me and to cheer me on (as well as talk shit and call me fat). As well my awesome wife who is always there to cheer me on, film my lifts, and be my rock- she is the reason why I can train as hard as I do and is therefore the reason why I am strong. I’d also like to thank my buddy Nemo for coming out to cheer me on, you’re the most beastly Asian dude I know and I’m pretty sure you could break Bruce Lee in half. 

Thanks for reading this novel.

TL;DR- Didn’t make weight. Won 165’s by default. ‘Merica.

You should definitely read the blog post if you haven't already, but I'll give a quick overview of how it is set up.  The program is extremely flexible.  Your lifts are broken into Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 work, with ~10, ~20, and ~30+ reps done in each tier respectively each session.  Tier 1 consists of main lifts only (squat, bench, deadlift, etc) at 85% of your max or higher.  Tier 2 is structured around main lifts, squat/bench/deadlift, but also similar movements, OHP/ front squats / etc.  Tier 3 is your volume work and other accessory work.

The other really nice thing about this program is the ability to schedule everything however the hell you want based on your time and goals.

I set my schedule into 4 week cycles, lifting 6 days per week, upping the weights used throughout the month.  My tier 1 work has been:

**Monday**: heavy **squat** day: 

*  5x2

**Tues**: heavy **bench** day

* 3x3, 2x2, 1x1

**Wed**: lighter **squat** day (speed work, high reps)

* 3x3, 4x10 or 5x8, then speed work

**Thurs**: volume **bench**

* 5x2

**Friday**: heavy **squat** day, higher weight but less total volume than Monday so that my deadlifts aren't weakened too much on Saturday

* 9x1

**Saturday**: **deadlift** day

* 3x3, 2x2, 3x1

**Sunday**: off

The weights progressed in 4 week cycles for all of the Tier 1 work, so Monday's squat day would be with 90% 1RM in week 1, 91% in week 2, 93% in week 3, and 95% in week 4 (there's nothing magical about these percentages, I chose them so that the weight went up at least 5lbs per week and that by the end of the month I was doing a double that I probably wouldn't have gotten at the beginning of the month).  As the weights went up, I'd decrease the weights of the Tier 2/3 work as needed so that I would still recover or decrease the reps a bit.

My Tier 2 work consisted solely of back squats, front squats, barbell bench press, incline bar press, seated OHP (I have a medical condition that prevents me from doing these standing, namely that I'm 6'5"" and the gym has low ceilings), conventional deadlifts, and sumo deadlifts.  Tier 3 work had even more of the same, plus dips, shrugs, squat lockouts, good mornings, GHRs, etc.  Note: I treat my deadlift days as back workouts, so all assistance on Saturdays is more back work: chins, pulldowns, db rows, bar rows, cable rows, shrugs, etc.

**Thoughts and changes**

After talking to gzcl, I'm swapping my schedule around some for the next few months.  I'll be squatting Tuesday/Friday, benching Monday/Thursday, deadlifting Saturday, and doing high volume back work on Wednesday.  I don't think I've had enough back work in my schedule, and while squatting 3x a week was great for a while, I haven't been recovering quite enough lately.

**Stats/Diet/sleep/etc**

* stats: 6'5"", 233+/-5 lb , 22 year old male

* diet: I didn't change the way I eat during this program.  I eat a shitton of meat and dairy (1.5lbs of cottage cheese and oat meal for breakfast today, etc) but I do eat clean (cook everything I eat from scratch, minus the cheese). I aim for 300g of protein a day minimum, and that's rarely a problem.

* sleep: usually get ~7 hours a night, but grad school does have a way of screwing with that.

**lifts**

* Squat: 365 -&gt; 405

* Bench: 290 - &gt; 305+ (I haven't retested my max this cycle, confident that a 310 would be easy, 315 might be possible)

* Deadlift: 485 -&gt; 525 (failed with 535)

* OHP: 185 -&gt; 200

---

**Tl;Dr: 1140 total to 1235 in 12 weeks with the infallible GZCL method. I have no intention of switching to a different program any time soon.**

Many thanks to /u/gzcl for both writing up his method and for responding to my gigantically long messages without snapping.

After getting permission from the mods there, and being presented a pretty good opportunity to get this started, we decided to start the weightroom warriors series.

What is a Weightroom Warrior? He/She is an active member of this subreddit who is doing something kick ass in their sport. 

And when it comes to powerlifting, it doesn't get much more kick ass then going toe to toe with the best in the world, and that is exactly what 21 year old Ryan Carillo (AKA /u/AdmiralVonBroheim) is preparing to do.

If you have spent any time around here, you have likely seen the name. And if you have encountered him at some meets...he probably left an [impression](http://i.imgur.com/nbfpi.jpg), because he is a [fucking beast](http://i.imgur.com/UasX3.jpg).

At 6'5"" and weighing in at over 330lbs, he is a single ply bench specialist, who has a meet bench PR of 611lbs. He also has a 600+lb squat and 595+lb deadlift (with a herniated disk). 

So why post about this now? Well, with that 611lb bench, Ryan earned a spot to compete in the World Bench Championships in Kaunas Lithuania, and he is looking for support to get there.

Ryan has put up a [site](http://www.txstrongman.com/#!untitled/component_14104) which  has more info about him and his journey, and for those who want to help Ryan go out and kick some ass, there is info on how to do that as well.

It seems like 90% of the deadlift form checks do this and I'm tired of seeing it. Stop deadlifting with your hips too low. The deadlift is not a squat. You're not ""getting your legs into it more"" by lowering your hips. Dropping the hips tilts the shins forward, which pushes the bar forward. If the bar is too far forward and it's heavy it will not come off the ground until your hips move up and the bar moves backwards and by then you'll usually be out of position and your quads haven't contributed anything. Stop doing it.

1361921129.0,111,self.weightroom,19agq0,NPC (National Physique Committee) Competition Report - Open Bikini Class F,super_luminal,127,16,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/19agq0/npc_national_physique_committee_competition/,"2 weeks ago I participated in my 3rd competition and took 4th out of 6 in my height class. I finally got the dvd in the mail (what is this 1999?) and ripped the thing and threw it up on youtube, so it's time to write up this little meet (meat?) report. 

I know we don't see a ton of bodybuilding content in here, but I'd like to try to be the change I'd like to see, rather than a whiny asshole, so please feel free to comment and ask questions. 

**Training** - I train on a team of Physique, Figure, and Bikini competitors with IFBB Pro Meriza DeGuzman-Ciccone 2 days per week and train the other days alone. The days I train with the team, we're in small groups (2 or 4 of us grouped by strength, usually) and do an upper body/lower body split. We tend to do a ton of reps 12-25 and often have assistance/do negatives/do drop sets when we reach failure. The days I train by myself I follow 5/3/1 with assistance that mirrors what I do with the team- lots of glute/ham/shoulder work at ~15 reps. I dubbed it 5/3/1 Bikini. I do cardio, but not tons- it turns into more as I get depleted close to the show because my heart rate slows dramatically. The cardio that used to take 20 minutes can take 40.  

**Diet** - This is the biggie and takes a ton of discipline. I love going to lift, can tolerate cardio, but what kind of lunatic wants to live on tilapia and 25g of brown rice carbs? I eat 6 meals a day to avoid chewing my own tongue off and while it is good food that I make for myself and carry with me everywhere, it takes a stupid amount of discipline to exist in a world full of free donuts, shared pizzas, and pitchers of beer. I eat constantly and my meals are between 200 and 400 calories a piece. I get over 200g of protein per day. Necessarily I eat ""clean."" Hate the term, but really, it just means I can't add ""stuff"" when every calorie counts and most of those calories have to be protein. Another way of looking at it is that what fits my macros is chicken, spinach and a nibble of sweet potato- not Haagen-Dazs (sadly). As comp prep goes on, and my physique is assessed my daily menu gets adjusted every 2 weeks and then weekly, protein always staying at the same level and fats and carbs getting ratcheted down.

**Show prep** - Prepping for a show usually takes about 6-8 weeks if you've been training hard consistently. This show I needed 6 weeks and all that it means when I go from off-season mode to on-season is that I turn up the cardio to 2 x per day, and shave some carbs and fats off my diet. My lifting basically stays the same (towards the end volume is turned all the way up). 

**Day of** - A bodybuilding show generally has Men's Physique and Bodybuilding and Women's Bikini, Figure, Physique and Bodybuilding (maybe, not a lot of competitors at this level anymore) which are all judged by their own criteria. Bikini and Physique are still pretty new categories and suffer a little bit from inconsistent judging as everyone gets comfortable with the new standards. Ex: some judges like super stick skinny bikini competitors, some like meatier, more muscular ones. Women's categories are broken into height classes, I am in the tallest class, Open Bikini F for women over 18 years of age and over 5'7"" (my NPC card says I am 5'7.5""). Next year I will qualify for Master's 35+ division, though I will still compete against the whippersnappers in Open.

I went into this show feeling a lot better about my physique than my previous 2 shows- the last one being 6 months ago. Prep was easier, I was definitely more trusting of the process. I knew to expect the moodiness, exhaustion, lack of libido, and other BS that comes along with show prep, so I could better filter what came out of my mouth during this period (is this something that would normally piss you off? y/n? n? keep mouth shut.). Once I saw the pictures though, I was really disappointed in my glutes. Was I having a bad ass-day? Did it really *look* like that. Then I got the video yesterday. Yeah, it looks terrible. All that work to lift and perkify and my butt looks flat sad and downtrodden next to the rest of the competition and what a bikini booty is supposed to look like. I wrote to the judges and my assessment was correct, my glutes need tightening, lower body needs more leanness and so it's back to the drawing board. I was going to compete again in a couple weeks but there's really no point if that's what I'm bringing to the stage. This stuff takes time, and you can't build when you're cutting, so it's time to eat and thrust dem barbells.

**TL;DR:**

##The Longer Version##

So, the last meet I did was at the Arnold Sports Festival back in March and I had taken some time off since then to try some things out and not have to worry about being in the 56 kg / 123.5 lb weight class.  I ended up doing the full Smolov program and got great gains out of it, but eventually got injured a month or so after finishing it which resulted in some loss of strength in my squat.  For a while I had felt like I wasn't sure what I wanted to do in regards to lifting and decided a meet was needed to help me get my head back in the game.  I looked for local meets but there wasn't anything good so expanding the search, I had found Wild Iron Gym was going to be putting on a USPA meet about a month after I found it, so I chose that one.

I decided to stay at 132 because cutting down to 123 (even with 24 hr weigh-in) would not only be difficult, but rather detrimental for trying to hit a solid total.  I used the 24 hr weigh-in to try tweaking my usual water loading protocol for 2 hr weigh-ins and I found my changes may have helped by a 1/4 - 1/2 lb, but I can't say for sure - the more important thing was getting more experience with water loading.  I weighed-in officially at 130.0 lbs on the dot (I was 134ish on the Sunday before the meet, so not a big drop, but it could come in handy for a 2 hr weigh in).  After weigh-ins I headed up to San Francisco to meet up with Abes and RedAnarchist for some BBQ and seeing SF.  Let me just stop right here and just say how fucking awesome these two guys are.  I get in and they're making sure I'm eating and drinking and having a good time all day.  Abes shows me around the SF, see some cool stuff, shoot the shit on anything and everything strength related, just had a fucking blast.  The only downside was that we both got rather ill (I puked a tad on Saturday and he on Saturday/Sunday and went to the hospital) which I blame on the BBQ place.

I didn't get a *great* amount of sleep Saturday night (woke up a few times feeling like I was going to puke) but I was up around 7:15am to pound down a pop-tart and Reese's peanut butter cup sandwich (it's exactly what it sounds like) and a box or two of Hello Pandas because I was unable to get any more volume of food or drink (and thus I had to abandon my plan to have breakfast at the nearby IHOP).

I arrived at Wild Iron Gym just around 8:30am and was there in time for the rules meeting (never lifted in USPA before and I didn't want to miss warm-ups) which went nice and quick.  Warm-ups for squats were interesting.  135 felt easy, 185 felt heavy, 225 was normal, 275 was heavy, and I thought I squatted 305 high because it felt easy.  I opened with 147.5 kg / 325 lbs and it was 3 white lights - felt fine.  I bumped my 2nd attempt to 157.5 kg for a nice 10 kg increase (347 lbs).  I was more relaxed for that squat as I had a squat on the board.  It didn't feel light, but it felt smooth and with that I put in 167.5 kg / 369 lbs for my 3rd attempt.  In hind-sight I should have listened to a few other people and gone heavier because while my 3rd attempt wasn't lightning fast, there was plenty more left in me if I wanted to do a grinder.  Oh well.

Bench warm-ups felt pretty heavy starting around 135, and there was a long break between 185 and when I did my opener at 95 kg / 209 lbs.  I completely forgot to get a hand-off person for my opener (I'm used to having one provided for me by the fed.) but since I train alone I was able to unrack it without an issue.  209 went up nice and smooth, looked faster on camera than it felt so I decided 102.5 kg / 226 would be a good 2nd attempt because then I could decide where in the 230ish range I wanted to go.  2nd attempt was slower but still smooth and the hand-off felt good so I knew I could beat 231 but 242 was out of reach, so I settled with 236.  I think I made the perfect call because 236 felt heavy and my left side was a bit slower but I was able to get the even lockout and thus another good lift, 3 white lights.

At this point I'm 6/6, white lights everywhere and holding a 275 kg subtotal (606 lbs).  I had planned to open with a heavier than usual deadlift so I went with 190 kg / 418 lbs.  That felt a bit heavier but went up great.  I knew I wanted to get in the mid-400 range for a 3rd attempt but I wasn't sure if I could get a 3rd in because I was feeling so gassed at this point.  I put in for 205 kg which would have been a 5 kg meet PR and got it without much issue, aside from it being heavy as fuck.  I put in 210 kg as a 3rd attempt because at this point I had hit the 480 kg total I was aiming for.  I missed 210 kg because I was so excited to try an all-time PR that I forgot to put on my belt for my 3rd attempt.  Yup, you read that right, I forgot my belt in my excitement.  Oh well, at least that's not a mistake I'll be making any time soon!  I won best open raw lifter so that was cool.

##Lessons Learned At This Meet##

* For me, there is no thing as warming up too early, just too late.  If you warm-up too early, just do another single that's less than your first attempt to stay warm.
* I need to push harder on my squat attempts at my next meet.
* Giving back to the sport is awesome.  There was a new collegiate team (SJSU) lifting there and I was able to give a bunch of meet and training advice to a large crew of college kids throughout the meet and it felt fucking incredible to give back.  If I ever got the chance to be a handler for a lifter at a meet, I'd do it in a heartbeat.
* No matter what level you lift at, you can still make stupid mistakes.

##What's Next##

My next training cycle is to focus first and foremost on weaknesses I have avoided addressing for some time, mainly mobility and upper back + core strength.  I wrote this plan prior to the meet and I feel like that was a very wise choice, as post-meet I always want to try a million different things rather than focus on a few key points.  I'll be squatting twice per week in a modified Texas Method inspired template and deadlifting once every other week (and on the off weeks focusing on upper back and core strength, no pulling from the floor).  I also need to bring up my glutes and hamstrings to the level my quads are at, so I will making good use of RDLs and GHRs.  As for bench, I used to be weak off the chest and now I am weak at lockout so I'll spend some time with the Slingshot to get some overload work in (I train alone so it's much less hassle than boards, bands, or chains).  To make sure my chest strength doesn't degrade I'll be doing my warm-ups as paused reps.  For OHP, I like where it's at and where it's going, so no real changes there.  I'm going to do some conditioning work to help with work capacity and assist with leaning out.  I'm not fat, but I have unnecessary fat for the weight-classes I compete it.  I need to get down to the 123s again before filling out for the new 59kg/130lb IPF weight class.

* [Next Training Cycle](http://i.imgur.com/DUihG.png)

I'll probably do another meet in some time between mid-December and mid-January to assess how my custom program worked and then prep for 2013 USAPL Raw Nationals.

##Thanks##

* Wild Iron Gym did a hell of a great job putting on the meet and I would definitely do another one there if the opportunity arose.
* The spotters had a number of great saves, no one got injured, and it seemed everyone had a great time.  This was a first meet for a good amount of lifters and the spotters had to deal with several dumps primarily on squats, but that didn't deter them from staying close and making sure the lifter was safe.  Hats off to them.
* A huge thanks to Jacob Rothenberg for taking video, handing-off for me, and keeping my nerves down, and for pushing me to put in heavier attempts.
* Another huge thanks to Abes, RedAnarchist, and friends for being awesome, making me feel welcomed, and showing me a great time in San Francisco, I had an absolute blast.  It was great to meet them in person, hang-out, take my mind off the meet, and really enjoy my time there (even despite all the walking - I'm looking at you Red).",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1349732028.0,,,True,t3_115q7h,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/115q7h/meet_report_san_jose_open_powerlifting/,

* **Deadlift**
 - Replace some deadlifts with clean pulls early in your warm-up sets if you suck at exploding at the top / getting hips through.
 - Use a light band anchored in front of you to pull the bar away from you if you need help activating lats to pull the bar into you.
 - If you get up on your toes too often, put a small plate under your mid-foot so your toes hang off.
* **Squats** - Actively think about pushing back into the bar, not straight up ... keeps a more vertical bar path / helps mitigate chest caving

I think it would be useful to all beginners to have some of the more experienced members create a list of what they think about and feel when performing a lift to ensure that it has been done correctly, and a good exercise for experienced lifters to help think about and solidify their technique. [Chr0me's answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/o3jc9/what_mucles_do_you_feel_activating_during_a/c3e5o71) and the general discussion from [What muscles do you feel activating during a deadlift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/o3jc9/what_mucles_do_you_feel_activating_during_a/) is a good example, although if we could put the cues in order from the start of the lift to the end, it would be even more useful. With enough responses, this could be a great resource for newcomers in the sidebar.

**Rules**

I'll start by creating a list of the 5 StrongLifts exercises, bolded in the comments. Anyone is welcome to create a new bolded top level comment with a _single_ exercise. Please avoid duplicates.

If you'd like to add your checklist, create it under an existing top level comment.

It's never to late to add a checklist, so if you're reading this in the future, feel free to keep it updated or to add your list.

If we get enough responses, this will go in the sidebar, so let's try and keep it organized.

Adam asked me to come on here tonight because the film is now finished editing, but we still need your help one last time to finish everything and get it ready for its run starting at the middle of December.

A little bit about myself...

* I have been competing for several years and have won medals at the National level. I am still moving up!
* I train nearly every day, with programming that has most of my training lifts in the 80%-85% range with rare testing. Rather than just snatch/CJ/front squat, the content of the programs are nearly always focused on improving where I am weakest.
* My long-term goal is to compete in the Olympics. My other long-term goal is to improve the sport within the U.S.

1344697213.0,98,self.weightroom,y1sco,On the Value of Broscience in the Gym. ,gzcl,125,27,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/y1sco/on_the_value_of_broscience_in_the_gym/,"Everyone reading this knows and understands the term ""broscience."" It is often cast in a negative light and is dismissed as unhelpful or complete bullshit. I personally dissect the concept of broscience into various categories; as I am sure many of you do as well. 

These categories could be defined along the lines of:

- Absolute broscience. For example: ""Bro, never eat bananas after 1400."" 

- Possible broscience. For example: ""Bro, if you want awesome shoulders you have to do Arnold Presses.""

The reason why I believe *some* broscience to be helpful is because it forces that individual to *actually go and try it.* If it doesn't work, does that make it wrong? No. Just as if it did work doesn't necessarily make it right. 

My point is, that the lines of what does and does not work in the weight room are not clearly drawn and therefore the hasty labeling of an idea or practice as ""brosciece"" is more often counterproductive towards a lifters progress. 

Now this isn't a defense of broscience nor is it an attack on actual science. However, anyone who has studied sports science or anything scientific in the exercise community knows that many of these papers describe studies which are flawed to varying degrees of severity. It is often argued that some *actual* science published by respected individuals in the exercise science community could be considered broscience because of these flaws. 

The important take away from all of this is that before the modern era of computers, video cameras, and all our technical wizardry, men and women were still very strong and very fast. Why? 

Because they went out and tried things. They listend to their peers and applied those lessons learned by those individuals to their own training. Men like [Jim Thorpe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Thorpe) and [Hermann Gorner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_G%C3%B6rner) didn't have access to fancy training facilities, minutely detailed programs, or finely tuned diets. They and their coaches experimented with what worked for them, discarded the trash and kept what was of value. 

Sure they may have been interested in the 'why' or 'how' some of their ideas worked. But what clearly had more value on it was *that it worked.* 

So why did I write all this out? Because it seems that most new lifters now days want to know all the reasons why they should be doing what they're doing. They ask for advice, a veteran gives it, then they ask that veteran why they're giving it. Enough! It is given because it was what worked for that seasoned lifter, and even if it had a research paper to back it up, doesn't necessarily mean it would translate well to that new lifter. Just as if there were a research paper to refute it doesn't make that veteran a liar, because it was what worked for him. 

The final point I want to make is directed at the novices in this subreddit. Do not get wrapped up in the microscopic details of your training. Do not concern yourself with all the 'whys' and 'hows' and 'whens.' These subjects will overwhelm you and your training will quickly turn into a quagmire; where progress is slow and painfully frustrating. Focus on your performance. If the bar continues to move as the weights get heavier then the science of your performance matters little.

What matters is that you can perform. ",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,vpm1,True,t3_y1sco,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/y1sco/on_the_value_of_broscience_in_the_gym/,

Long story short I've been spending quite a bit of time getting this clothing line going, and it's actually going a lot smoother than I thought it would. 

The idea in a nutshell is to provide clothes for guys who want shirts that aren't too tight in shoulder, fit arms correctly, up the neck size, actually correctly fit waist (no muffin top), consider certain muscles like traps/lats, and other little things. Pants will accomodate bigger quads/glutes without forcing you to buy bigger waist sizes.

So here's my update I left on /r/swoleacceptance, I'm just going to copy-paste it here for convenience.

----

Hey guys, been a while since I mentioned my idea for swole clothes. I'd like to inform you that things are going smoothly and all the plans are fully underway.

I've gotten a ton of positive feedback from my more fit friends, my friends who are into business, and a bunch of other people so I'm going full throttle on this project.

I currently have the design aspect, a good chunk of funding, some designers, and I have singled out a few companies to source production of clothes. I've broken down what the next few months of building up everything will look like in three phases.

***PHASE 1*** - Collect Data

This is where I currently am at. In order to make clothes for guys like us I need accurate data on shirt / pant sizes. Aside from asking friends and friends of friends; My current strategy for this is hitting up random gyms and asking management to allow me to approach members and take their shirt measurements. As you can imagine, this is extremely awkward and the responses are mixed, sometimes positive and sometimes not so much. I'm still plugging away and will get enough data for it to be useful, and the Internet I'm sure could also help speed up the process.

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/R9NZYSD

I've included a survey with this post that just asks for general shirt measurements. If you want you can fill it out (none of the questions are required, so if there's a measurement you don't know you can just skip it). This would be a great help to get things started faster and help me get into phase 2!


http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/R9NZYSD


***PHASE 2*** - Kickstarter / Build Base

After I get good enough data to separate into various sizes + fits, I can get my designers on creating the starting line. During this time I will be working on the site and online presence which will be mainly focused on my Kickstarter campaign to help spread the word.

The kickstarter campaign will probably be the most important aspect to getting started. 

Once that is started and finished, I will be focusing on the upcoming launch.

***PHASE 3*** - Launch

This is the ultimate and final phase. All of the work and kickstarter will lead into the launch where I can start fulfilling orders. This phase is still low on details because I'm busy working on right now!


Oh, and by the way, the name of the brand will be Swole Society. I've already bought the URL so don't think it's available :D. I'm still going to post from this account though.


-------

So, that's it for now. Thank you for reading. Anything you're curious about feel free to ask me in this thread or through a PM.

This was the first meet I had to both coach at and lift at in the same day.  In addition to that this was the latest I had ever competed so I think that hurt my performance a little bit.  We didn't weigh in until noon so all I had was some sips of water here and there and a protein shake.  The early session went by fast and even though it wasn't their best day both of them won their weight classes and Meghan took home Best Female Lifter with a 796 total @ 132.  Once the awards were over I got weighed in and unsurprisingly was well below the cut off at 212.  

During warm ups I got saddled with a bunch tall dudes and high bar squatters so the rack height was uncomfortably high.  There were a ton of lifters and we were tight for time so I decided to not adjust the rack height for my warm ups.  This was a retarded decision by me because when I hit my last warm up single of ~460 it was basically a grinder.  I began freaking out (not realizing I was basically high bar squatting) and rushed the the scorers table to change my opener but unfortunately it was too late.  Luckily once I got on the platform everything went better.

**Squat**

Opener - 501.  Easy and deep.  3 Whites.

2nd - 529.  Slower than usual out of the bottom but fairly easy once I got out of the hole.  3 Whites.

3rd - 551.  Holy fuking hell.  It felt like I was under the bar for an eternity.  I had zero pop out of the hole so I had to grind for about 8 seconds before I stood back up.  3 whites.  11lb meet PR.

I started warming up for bench and immediately felt off.  My bench has always sucked but I felt like it had improved enough during this training cycle in order for me to grab at least a small meet PR.

**Bench**

Opener - 275.  Easy as it should be.  3 Whites.

2nd - 292.  Slow but smooth even though my right arm tried to derp.  3 Whites.

3rd - 297.5 I decided to take a conservative jump in order to go 3/3 on bench.  My left arm was basically locked out but my right arm just didn't finish.  3 Reds, No Lift.  FML.

Deadlift warm ups felt amazing but at the same time my lower back was tightening up pretty bad.  I knew I had the 220s wrapped up so I decided to make sure that I got a PR total.

**Deadlift**

Opener - 573.  Easy.  3 Whites.

2nd - 600.  Easy, maybe even faster than my opener.  3 Whites.

3rd - 617.  Slow but smooth.  I think I could have pulled 623 but I didn't want to risk it.  5lb meet PR to ensure a PR total of 1460.  

**Results**

First place in the 220s and a 17lb meet total PR.  I wasn't very satisfied with my performance as I felt off the whole day but you can't be too disappointed when yo go home with some PRs and a gold medal. 

I finally got drug tested which (as strange as it may sound) was a goal of mine this year.

**Closing Thoughts**

Where do I go from here?  Well obviously Raw Nationals will be my next meet.  I think I've hit my strength ceiling at this body weight so this will be the last time I compete as a 220 in 2013.  I have plenty of room to grow into the 231 class so that should be a fun ride.  I'm going to talk to Mike and hopefully we can figure out something to improve my bench because it's basically crippling my total.  We'll see what some weight gain and plenty of hard training will do.

July 25th marks the 5 year anniversary of the death of strongman Jesse Marunde. Jesse went out as one of the top competitors in the world, and is part of the reason for the rapid growth of the sport. He passed away doing what he loved, training as hard as he could, but his legacy lives on. His personality and kindness is remembered throughout the strongman community, as well as his deep affection for squatting hard, and so as tribute, competitors everywhere are known for paying respects by completing a ""widowmaker"" set of squats.

Whether you are a seasoned competitor, or have just finished SS, we invite you to compete in the second official r/weightroom contest, a ""widowmaker for max"". If you're unfamiliar with what a widowmaker set it, just load the bar to a weight you don't think you can do for 20 reps, and then do 20 reps with it without racking. A general guideline is a 10RM.

The rules:

* All squats must be to parallel. A few high reps will not DQ you as long as the effort is there, but will result in a penalty for each rep not ""completed"". If you're not sure, do an extra rep.

* Belt and knee sleeves allowed, no knee wraps or suits.
Weight classes are mens &lt;175, &lt;200, &lt;231, and HW, and womens &lt;150 and HW. Video of weigh-in to verify.

* Heaviest widowmaker in each class wins.

* Prizes are tentative and TBA, but at the very least you'll get some sweet flair.

* Video must be taken from an angle that allows us to see depth.
 
* Record a warm up set just to be sure.

* Deadline is 11:59PM Sunday, your time.  Post videos in /r/weightroomcontests

* Have fun, and squat till long after it hurts.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1343259984.0,,,True,t3_x1joz,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/x1joz/rweightroom_contest_widowmaker_squats/,

- 5""9-10 (somewhere in there), 80.5kg., 35 Years Old, female (obviously)
- Training 4-5x a week since …a long time.  Steadily on 531 for the last 3 months, was injured with a hamstring tear, a sprained back and an ass blow up all in a row…prior to a few months ago.  Was lifting but stalling.  Prior to that, I was working with trainers that were apparently very, very bad.
- Train for powerlifting, boxing for conditioning.  Occasional running.
- First Powerlifting meet
- 3 years ago, I weight 320 lbs.  I've done a variety of things to get the weight down over that period but feel pretty solid with calorie counting and low carb.  
- I've been taking fish oil, vitamin D and calcium/magnesium but not regularly
- I fell into powerlifting totally by accident as a way to lose weight.  I can credit r/fitness with that although I never read the FAQ.  I had no idea what a deadlift was and was too lazy to actually google it but it sounded super bad ass so I told my trainer I wanted to learn how to do them.  

**Meet Prep**

I first looked into competing in the fall of last year as a way to push myself to do more and progress on my weight loss but I was continually spraining my back due to a good morning incident and then re-injuring it with shitty deadlifting form.  Then there was an incident with my ass.

I've been uninjured since February or so and kind of felt like I was starting from scratch.  I started 531 around that time which was smart.  Very, very smart of me.  

My weight has been holding steading in the 185-190 range for the last 6 months or so.  This meet was the motivation I needed to start working harder on that.  I'd love to say that it's just an issue of doing the math and calorie restriction but at that weight and the amount of activity I do, I should be maintaining at around 2200.  I've only been losing in the last three weeks because I've restricted down to 1100-1200.  Fuck my retarded body.

**The Lifts**

4/9 on the lifts.  Not amazing but I didn't bomb out and that's the important thing.  Also, I'm apparently very exciting to watch because everything I do looks super hard and it's slow to either go up or down or back up again.  The crowd shouting was a huge motivator - it got my last squat attempt up and my first deadlift attempt which felt painfully slow.

**Squat**

- 75kg - nerves completely fucked me.  When I stepped back, my feet were far too close together.  I tried to fix them, couldn't and then did some sort of very weird squat morning deal that had all of the spotters asking me if I was ok.
- 75 - this one was properly positioned but I was a tad too high.  I can see it in the photos now.  
- 75 - got down to the position in the second, stopped and heard my coaches shouting to get lower, went below parallel to be safe and grinded that fucker back up in the ugliest squat morning you've ever seen in your life.  But it was enough to get three white lights and I didn't get turfed out of the comp.

**Bench**

- 45kg - this was supposed to be 47.5kg but after being humbled on my squat, I dropped it to be safe.  It went up easy, no problems.  I had been missing commands in training so I was very cognizant of that on the first go around.
- 47.5 - I was completely in the wrong position.  I got told that I bench like a body builder.  I'm not sure what that means but I've been neglecting my bench.  My arch is tiny, my hands are too close and my arms are all over the place.  My goal now is to work on my shitty, shitty bench form.
- 47.5 - same issue. 

**Deadlift**

- 97.5g - this was extremely hard and extremely slow to go up.  When I saw the video between lifts, I was way too far forward and my ass was up too high.
- 100kg - Taking some very sage advice, I lowered my ass and got less forward.  This one went up easy.
- 102.5kg - I'm really mad at myself on this one.  It went half way up and gave up because I was feeling a bit defeated by the whole meet at that point.  It should have gone up and it would have been a 2lb PR.

**Results**

I didn't bomb, which is good.  No one else was lifting in my weight class so I got first which kind of feels like a participation medal but whatever.  My deadlift was the highest out of all of the women lifting.

**Records**

Hahahaha.  No.

**Final Thoughts**

- On my two hour drive home, I did a lot of thinking about went wrong and what I could learn from the experience.  I have an ego problem.  This is in part due to being unrealistic and partly comparing myself to others I shouldn't be comparing myself to.  I really have to remember this is only about me and my progress and I need to focus on that more.
- I was really aiming to be under 80kilos in weight and was disappointed that didn't happen.  However, 177 is the lowest I've weighed in my adult life and I'm really proud of that.  I was 178 for like a day in university.  I'm pretty sure I celebrated that with carbs as I did tonight.  The cut begins again tomorrow.  I will be sending in my application for another meet that happens in three weeks in my area.  I'm trying to look at this as a dress rehearsal for the next meet where hopefully, i will get that 237lb deadlift and not suck so hard on my bench and, of course, not do a squat morning.
- I've decided to try and make the lower weight class for a meet in August.  This will require me to lose 19lbs which doesn't seem like a lot but given that I'm not losing unless I'm eating 1200 cal a day, this will be a joyless summer.  I don't think 158.4 is a good weight for me to be in the long term.  I'm finally starting to enjoy my body and I think 170 is a good weight for me to be at but I see this as a challenge.  
- I bled all over the bar in my warm up deadlifts and learned that pants should always be worn in warm ups for a meet.
- I need to focus more on the lifts themselves than focussing on trying not to fuck up because that, my friends, is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
- I am trying to remind myself that just showing up is the success here and failure was being too scared or apathetic to try.
- Powerlifters truly are the most support human beings on the planet.  The spotters were constantly shouting at me during every lift and that was awesome.  And helpful.

I had two amazing coaches who tirelessly trained me in their home and for that, I'm more grateful than I can possibly put into words.  I was just some weirdo from the internet that emailed them one day about getting into the CPU and they were incredibly encouraging from the getgo.  I mean, who does that?  I could have been a serial killer.  Or worse: an arsonist.  

And I have to give some shout outs to people here:  triplewithcheese whose deadlift advice saved my second attempt.  KomradeKettlebell who, for the last two years has been sarcastically supportive.  Shortkid for offering to help and the ladies:  Kookie, super, tangy and the rest for being great at what they do and aside from being genuinely encouraging, make me strive to lift heavier by their own posted lifts.  A special shout out to seppy who fed me during this meet.  And yes, it did stick to me teeth but it was delish.

[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/exJ0p)  The last one was the 102.5 deadliest that only went up half way.  There are videos (of the ugliest squat morning you've ever seen in your life but they're on someone's phone so just take my word for it.

And it brings up the issue of lifting weights being at odds with being feminine, which is one potential reason for the dearth of women in the weightroom. 

Another article went in to more depth here:

http://gubernatrix.co.uk/2010/07/femininity-and-muscle/

And I just wanted to start some discussion about femininity and lifting, since I would say most of us enjoy feeling powerful when we lift, and is that something that still feels unfeminine?

Again, I'd like to share my thoughts on this program, albeit more significantly brief than last time, as I didn't need to make any modifications and I again followed the program to the tee, however I was *severely* side-tracked by a debilitating injury around the end of April, where I fell and completely tore up my knees, which took weeks to rehab and restore to full health. That will definitely explain the paltry increase in my squat, but there are of course some caveats to those numbers as well. I again did a strength assessment at the end of this program to compare/contrast my progress since the beginning of the year.

**The program:**

* I found this program much easier to follow in general. Jim warns about recovery and the need to eat, and I certainly did that, so I never really experienced any soreness from lifting 6 days a week. I actually quite enjoyed it. **LESSON: Know yourself. I dig frequency, so this program rocked. YMMV**

* Originally my accessory work varied every day in the 6-day cycle, but I started to learn and feel exactly what exercises really targeted my weaknesses. For example, barbell curl was an extreme bang for the buck - I felt effective stimulation of my biceps and forearms. Trying to vary it by using DB curls and preacher curls felt like a waste. Eventually, by the end of the program, I was doing one kind of accessory work for upper body and one kind of accessory work for lower body days - each addressing whatever weakness I had at the time. **LESSON: variety doesn't matter. Efficacy of exercise selection matters, and that comes through experimentation to see what exercises work for you.**

**The results:**

START

205 lbs bw

195 OHP

280 Bench

370 squat

435 deadlift

FINISH

215 lbs bw

195 OHP

300 Bench

380 squat (no belt)

465 deadlift (no belt)

I don't know how I feel about this. My OHP apparently didn't increase, I feel like it has. I could probably hit 200 today if I tried, but it might have been that I scaled back my weights to accommodate Jim's whole ""10% off your training max to start"" which is basically the kiss of death for the OHP since the weights are so small already. Psyched about the bench and deadlift increases. My squat barely increased but I attribute that to a few things: (A) I fucked up my knees. Literally had to rehab them for 3 weeks - 2 of which involved 0 lower body movement. (B) this is a beltless squat. My best ever was 385 with a belt, and this was 380 no belt, definitely below parallel. I'll chalk it up to a win, but when you see the strength relativity chart, it's clearly my weakest lift.

**The Assessment:** [view here](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/how_much_can_you_lift_wimp)

You can check my last post on the details of this assessment, but overall I would say I'm pretty well-balanced in terms of muscularity and size, which is nice. There are a few tweaks I have since made to the assessment since last time:

* Hang clean and jerk have been removed. They're just going to be weak because I'm not an Olympic lifter so I see no reason to try and hit a 1RM in a lift I am not trained well in and risk injury. No thanks.

* Last time I did 5RM, this time I did actual 1RM. Because of that, some lifts became retarded to test, so I dropped them. The overhead DB tricep extension comes to mind. Apparently I would need a 160 lb DB, which I don't have, and even if I did, the ROM limit based on the size of the dumbbell would effectively make it useless.

* Why is there a Bulgarian squat and a split-squat test? Fuck that, I did a Bulgarian split squat.

* I don't get this shit with the calf raises and 1 DB single-leg RDL. These seemed WAY too easy. It's not explained very well what 1 DB means...1 DB both legs? 1 DB 1 leg? I did a single leg RDL with 75s in both hands and that was hard...but on the site he says 1 DB? Seems weird.

* Curls. The curl measurements are fucking asinine. So I went onto the Raw Powerlifting standards charts, and since I have a 380/300/465 split, it actually matches up pretty well with a Class II raw powerlifter. What's the strict curl? 116. One hundred and sixteen fucking pounds. This chart says my DB AND BB curl should be 160. That would put me at ELITE status. [Uuuh...](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/051/726/17-i-lol.jpg?1318992465) yeah. So I adjusted all bicep measurements to not be stupid high. Turns out when you balance them out *appropriately*, I actually have *way* stronger biceps than I thought I did. Certainly focusing on them over the last 2+ months helped, and it shows. Now I've got to bring my triceps up to par!

**IN CONCLUSION:**

I like 5/3/1 Frequency Project. A lot. I think this will be my standard off-season template. It works, and barring injuries, I would imagine better results than last time. What have I learned in addition to the last program?

* **If you focus on a muscle, you will definitely bring it up**. My front squat and biceps sucked before, now they don't. But once you do that, you have to make sure to constantly re-assess so you can bring up the newest weak link. In my case, it is the squat, which is why I'm going to be running a Smolov base cycle, followed by Coan Phillipi because I would like a 500 lb deadlift for my meet, so I've got some serious poundage to add there.

* Frequency definitely works for me. Stick with what you know.

* Some exercises target unexpected areas. When the bottom of my squat was the sticking point, I tried everything to get my glutes to fire and build them: back extensions, RDLs, hip thrusts (single and double-leg), good mornings. You know what worked best? *bulgarian split squats*. WHO KNEW?! Sometimes you gotta mix it up so much until you feel the soreness where you need it.

* I'm at the point where off-season training needs frequency combined with targeted accessory work on whatever my sticking point is. Right now that's my shoulders/tris and just squatting way more (hence Smolov).

* This is my first time trying specialized programs specifically for a lift. It's exciting but also intimidating to be at a point where my strength needs to be specialized.

**A brief blurb on nutrition:** Cause everyone is going to ask...I did gain more weight than before in less of a time span. I attribute this to the fact that every day was a workout, which meant every day go the PWO treatment of stuffing my face. This leads to gains. I will say though that I've been hovering around 212-215 for a while, so my body feels like it's reaching that threshold where if I want to gain any more weight, it's going to require drastic measures (adding heavy cream to shakes, olive oil shots, eating peanut butter when bored). Plus I don't know if my pants will like me...everything is starting to not fit. I'm definitely capping my gains off at 220 if possible. So basically, eat until you fucking hate yourself. Then eat some more. No I'm not tracking anything because at this point, the only way I can gain weight is to just eat even when I'm not hungry, and just fucking eat always. Ugh.

**TLDR: 5/3/1 Frequency Project is great and also works. It's my favorite program for off-season training and I would highly recommend it if you also dig high-frequency workouts.**

* Squat: 300, 315, 330 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_zoqvUk2y4&amp;feature=youtu.be) (+5 pr)

* Bench: 220, 245, 255 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf33FH8mJSo&amp;feature=youtu.be) (+5 pr)

1010 lbs @ 195 lbs (295 wilks) (height -- 6'2"", 29 years old) 3rd place in weight class.

**Background**

First stepped foot in a weight room about 18 months ago. Been training consistently since then, using the standard SS --&gt; Madcow --&gt; 5/3/1 progression. I'm currently doing BBB for everything except squats, for which I'm following a TM template since they're lagging behind. I signed up for this meet on a whim about 2.5 weeks ago.

**Prep**

Everyone says you aren't supposed to cut weight for your first meet, but I was at 202 when I signed up so I figured I might as well just go down to 198. Ended up weighing in at 195, so I guess I overshot it a little (suppy-style cutting). I didn't lift at all in the 1.5 weeks leading up to the meet.

**The Meet**

* Squat: felt moderately heavy warming up, so I was kind of worried. Opened with 300, which felt really heavy. Decided to go for a modest increase, to 315, which felt a little easier. Then I tried for a +5 PR, which also wasn't too hard. The 300 felt hardest of all, which probably means I'm terrible at warming up.

* Bench: I wasn't sure how my gym lifts would translate to meet. I always do paused benching, but it's still different waiting for commands. I opened with a very conservative 220 (I've hit 225x5 before), then went up to 245 and finally 255 for a 5 lb PR. 

* DL: Opener at 365 felt easy so I went straight to 425 to tie my gym PR. That felt very heavy, so I went for a +5 lb increase and couldn't get it off the ground.

**Thoughts**

For a first meet, it was a great experience. It was very smoothly run and a lot of fun. There are a lot of really strong guys out there and it was fun to see them lift (600 lbs was broken in each lift). I'll keep training and hopefully find another meet in 6-12 months or so. I'd love to have a 4-plate squat by then but we'll see...

Highlight: a 14 year old, 130 lb kid pulling 330 on his 4th attempt to set an SPF record. Great moment.

**Thanks**

TL/DR : 

* Deep squats exercise the muscles with the least possible stress on bones and joints (vs half squat)
* If the weight is too heavy to let you go deep, it is too heavy to have on your back!
* Deep squats facilitate smoother and less risky training, as fewer plates and less peripherals and help from spotters are required.

[This is what weightlifting shoes](http://www.roguefitness.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/0dc2d03fe217f8c83829496872af24a0/d/o/dowin-4_1.jpg) look like. Other shoes that some people wear while lifting, e.g. Chucks or Vibrams, are not weightlifting shoes. [Here is an article](http://www.dynamic-eleiko.com/sportivny/library/farticles015.html) explaining the history of weightlifting shoes and why they are necessary. [Here is an article](http://www.70sbig.com/blog/2010/01/equip-for-the-quest-%E2%80%93-shoes-part-2/) from 70sbig about why you should wear them. [The SS wiki](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/Equipment#Shoes) also has some info about shoes with some videos.
   
Weightlifting shoes generally have the following features:
 
* Non-compressible sole
* Metatarsal strap
* Raised heel
 
I've noticed that some people tend to think that barefoot is the best way to be and so the best lifting shoe is the one that is most like no shoe at all. I would argue that unless you are specifically training for some kind of barefoot competition, this is a flawed assumption. The best equipment is that which facilitates safe, efficient, and effective training. This is why we spend most of our time lifting specialized implements like barbells and dumbbells, even if we’re not training specifically to lift those objects – they allow us to train effectively. Shoes are the same way.
   
The sole and strap in a weightlifting shoe provide stability and efficient transfer of force to the ground to a much greater extent than something like Chucks. Chucks don’t hinder your lifting the way running shoes do, but they don’t really facilitate it either. I spent years lifting in Chucks and [squatted 405 in them](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiwbhyYhCLI). I don’t lift in them anymore, though. The other day I got to the gym and absent-mindedly forgot to change out of my Chucks and into my lifting shoes and my squats felt terrible.
 
As explained in the first article above, the purpose of the heel is to facilitate the forward knee movement necessary for very deep squatting positions, similar to the way some people squat with plates or blocks of wood under their heels. Every competitive Olympic lifter wears weightlifting shoes with a raised heel. A raised heel will be most important if you’re planning on performing the Olympic lifts or “ass to grass” squats (front or back). They will also be more helpful for people with longer femurs. Low-bar squatters won’t need as much of a heel lift – I squat Starting Strength style and I wear a .5” heel (the [Rogue Rippetoe shoes](http://www.roguefitness.com/2010-5-rips-weightlifting-shoes.php), which are no longer made, but the [Adidas powerlift trainers](http://www.roguefitness.com/adidas-weightlifting-shoes.php) are supposed to be similar). Rippetoe says in Starting Strength that a pair of weightlifting shoes is one of the best investments you can make in your lifting. I see a lot of form checks with problems that would be improved by a good pair of shoes, so look around and consider trying a pair.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_rlzpo,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rlzpo/what_weightlifting_shoes_are_and_arent/,

&gt; And While We're At It
&gt;Back squatting isn't for everyone, but let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.
&gt;Although I've personally helped plenty of people with chronically bad backs learn to squat pain-free in a matter of months (if not weeks), those with a history of lower back issues should probably refrain from back squatting, at least temporarily.
&gt;Secondly, those with limited t-spine mobility (particularly in extension) are going to have a hard time back squatting. Trying to crank someone into maximal abduction and external rotation – especially for someone who doesn't have it – is a recipe for disaster, and can often manifest into a plethora of other issues in the neck, back, and even the elbow.
&gt;If that's the case, it's time to get your front squat on.




[Eric Cressey, How To Front Squat](http://www.ericcressey.com/how-to-front-squat-technique)
&gt; The squat is one of the most revered strength training exercises of all time, and the front squat is a popular variation on this compound lift.  However, like many lifts, it's often performed incorrectly, and in many cases used by folks for whom it isn't a good fit.

*****

**Introduction**

So I decided to try [Lyle McDonald's Ultimate Diet 2.0](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/ultimate-diet-20), which is actually a diet and training program that *must* be done together. Up until now, I've avoided the program as I like doing my own thing and didn't want to give it up - but I was willing to try itafter I came back from my vacation. 

*****

**The program**

* 4 days of low carb, 3 days of high carb (including a massive 7000+ calorie refeed). 
* Very specific type of full-body weight workouts, 4 days a week. Check out the last post here for an awesome spreadsheet: http://forums.lylemcdonald.com/showthread.php?t=12724&amp;page=4
* Optional cardio.
* It allows almost no flexibility and should only be done by those that have complete control over their diets/training.

*****

**What I did**

* Hit all macros almost perfectly. If I went out, I guessed macros and still fit them in. DO NOT FAST ON THIS DIET. Combining Leangains and UD 2.0 is not smart. 
* I did front squats for depletion the first week. Horrible idea and I do not recommend anyone do this. 
* I had to join two gyms with ""trial"" memberships to get access to the necessary machines. Possible with compound-only movements? Yeah, but it sucks BALLS. Like, it sucks so much you'll probably quit after the first workout. 
* Depletion workouts always sucked more than anything I've ever done. The first week was easily the worst though. 
* I used the optional EC, calcium, and fish oil supplementation. 
* Hit records, including my front squat (255lbs ATGx3). 
* Hurt my back in the third week putting away plates, so I did a lot of isolation work in the last week. 
* I did cardio once in the last week. In the future, I'd probably do it more, as I do think it helps with the stubborn fat.

*****

**Would I do it again?**

Probably. Yeah. It's the workouts I disliked, but I got used to it. 

******

**Would I recommend you buy the book?**

Yes. I found myself referencing it a hundred times over.

* Started lifting 6 months ago using Starting Strength. Switched to something Texas Method-y about a month and a half ago
* Take fish oil, creatine, vitamin D, a multivitamin, and whey protein powder.
* Nothing special about my diet - I try to get plenty of protein, and I'm working on eating more fruits and veggies.
* Swam and ran cross country in 5th-7th grade, but this is my first real sport since then.


**Meet Prep**

I found this meet browsing [PowerliftingWatch](http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/). I did a bunch of research, bought a singlet and knee socks, and felt like I almost sort of knew what I was doing by meet day. I brought a lot of food to the meet but ended up being too nervous to eat most of it.

I wanted to hit the 123lb weight class (I was about 126lbs) so I started slowly dropping calories and cutting out junk food a month out. I was generally weighing in under 123 the week of the weigh-in, but I did some water cycling and avoided carbs and sodium the day before just to be sure I wouldn't miss it.

My program has a weekly ""taper"" built in, so I didn't change much about my training to prepare for the meet. I'd normally do a really heavy but short day on Wednesdays, and I toned it down a little for my last workout before the meet.


**The Lifts**

I was surprised at how well I lifted - I guess the adrenaline was really helping. My previous PRs only added up to 470 so this was a big jump for me.

I did all my openers at weights I wasn't worried at all about hitting so I could focus on following commands and getting used to the new equipment. That was a great decision.

I ended up making every attempt, so I probably should have challenged myself a little more and tried higher weights.


**Squat**

* 155 - Went up easy, as I expected
* 170 - This was my previous PR. It was tougher but it wasn't much of a problem.
* 180 ([video, a little long, sorry! the rest are short](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV2mTuhnXy0&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - I wanted 175, but they laughed at me and said I should try higher. Glad I did! This was tough, but I bet I could have done 5lbs more.


**Bench**

* 80 - Again, easy
* 90 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZC0Wnj5-FU&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - My previous PR. This felt a lot easier than last time I did it.
* 95 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5p4iiXDcS9k&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - I've attempted 95 over and over in the gym and failed, so I didn't want to shoot for 100 yet. Hopefully I'll hit it in a couple weeks!


**Deadlift**

* 190 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_I5ufoWv7A&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - Easy
* 215
* 230 ([video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNKNGJlxrUg&amp;feature=youtu.be)) - My original plan was to shoot for 225, but I felt like I was on a roll. Plus, the state record for my weight class was 225 and I wanted to beat it. I did! This was 20lbs higher than my previous PR.


**Final Thoughts**

I was pretty nervous, but I'm really really glad I decided to try this. Everyone was very nice, just like the internet said they would be.

Again, I wish I'd challenged myself a little bit more with the weights. These were all solid PRs though and I'm proud of them.

500lb: no lift.

[250lb Hussafell stone for distance](http://youtu.be/xqtInFlcpl4): 60 seconds of stressful struggling and then a few steps. Watching the video is quite painful, but for the sake of staying humble, there it is.

Grip medley: 100lb grenade pull, 125lb rolling handle, 200lb grenade pull.

250lb rolling handle: no lift.

Got 3rd in my weight class, out of 3. Also got a snazzy t-shirt and a certificate that says I got 3rd place. Luckily, it doesn't list how many competitors there were.

**Format and failures:**

The log press and 18” deadlift were done in a last-man-standing fashion, meaning that you enter at your chosen weight (or the minimum for your weight class), but once you enter you have to complete each 10% jump in weight until you fail. Since it was my first competition, I elected to start at the minimum for both log press and the 18” deadlift. Most people entered at higher weights, so I was doing reps fairly quickly, which led me to messing up my log clean at 180lbs and subsequently failing to press it properly. On the 500lb deadlift I neglected to stay on my heels and ended up pitching forward near lockout and losing the lift. 

Though I had a chance to train the log press once before the actual competition at /u/toneguyAK’s gym, I’d never laid eyes on a husafell stone before. Turns out that not only do they look like coffins, but they’re also top heavy, meaning they flip under you the second you even try to heft them up. Needless to say, I struggled for an embarrassing minute with the stone before lifting the thing and stumbling a few steps with it, dropping it and yelling “PR!” while walking away. I overthought the approach and attempted to remember cues I saw the other guys doing, but I should’ve gone with my gut and lifted the damn thing, which is how I got it up in the end anyway. By far my weakest event.

Though 170lbs and 480lbs are technically PRs, I feel I could’ve at least hit a 180lb log press and a 500lb 18” deadlift if I entered at a higher weight, but I have no regrets in playing it safe.

I’m satisfied with my performance in the grip medley, considering only one competitor out of 30 managed to lift all four weights. I managed three.

**Prep:**

I signed up for this thing about three months ago on a whim, after a friend linked me the registration website. I put my squat on 5/3/1 so that it would continue to improve without me having to think about it too much. I dropped bench completely from my training. I worked overhead at least twice a week, squatted once, deadlifted once and rack pulled at least once every two weeks. I supplemented squats with zercher deadlifts to imitate stone carries (note: this doesn’t work *at all*, lesson learned).

In December 2012 I could strict press 180lbs, and push press around 220lbs. Unfortunately, I still had to make weight and I was weighing in above 200. On January 1st I was a a definite 210lbs, and being absolutely paranoid about making weight, started to cut. My overhead strength suffered, but I pulled a 455 PR from the floor two weeks out from the meet. However, I pull primarily sumo and thus my conventional 18” deadlift was barely better than my sumo from the floor. So, that’s something to work on. Long story short, I overdid my cut and ended up 192lbs when I was five days out. After a few emergency (but controlled) sandwiches I weighed in the day of the meet at 194.6 lbs. Weigh-in started 2 hours before the rules meeting, so I weighed in as soon as possible and went to go eat bacon.

**Lessons learned and future plans:**

Now that I can finally eat without thinking about what I’m putting in my mouth, I’m going to take some time to work on being properly strong with barbells (even though they don’t transfer as well as I’d like to strongman lifts). My next goal is a 405 squat, from a tested max of 350 three months ago, as well as bringing my overhead press back from the grave of caloric deficits.

I learned more than I thought possible about strongman, training in general and my own strengths and weaknesses. Turns out I also cut pretty well.

I only know how to make friends in the gym and I also tend to take 3-7mins between work sets depending on the movement so sometimes I am sitting there in the gym twiddling my thumbs wondering if people can see how awkward and lonely I am while I die from squatting sets of 5 wishing I could have someone to talk to. 

So I was thinking - man, everyone on reddit seems so friendly, wouldn't it be pretty neat to have a redditor lifting meet up? 

So hey guys - I'm in the DFW Texas area, is anyone interested in meeting up at some fucking globo gym and banging out some curls? Spotting/upright rowing each other's benches? Grinding our crotches into everyone else's gluteal muscles screaming IT'S ALL YOU BRO on a squat of insufficient depth? 

Look man. I'm just a regular guy who likes to lift weights. Holla atcha boy if you're interested. 

Or not, I can just listen to Radiohead in-between sets like I have been doing for the entirety of my fucking life it's fine.

I'd like to start this out by saying that this meet wasn't sanctioned by any federations, and it wasn't incredibly well organized. It was just a fun National Fitness Day (apparently that's a thing) event that my university decided to put on, and since I've never competed in powerlifting, I decided to give it a shot. The meet was only announced last Friday, the weight classes were weird, the bench press didn't require a pause, chalk wasn't allowed for deadlifts (but I snuck some anyway), I had to walk my squats entirely out of the squat rack because the safety bars were too high for me to hit parallel, and I did all my attempts for each lift one after the other with nobody lifting in between. My body weight was 174, which put me in the weird 160-185 pound class. Since I only had a week's warning and was sitting at 176 pounds last Friday, I decided not to try to cut 16 pounds in a week to get to the lower weight class.

My lifts:

Squat: 335, 365, 385 (fail)

Bench Press: 290, 305 (two failed attempts)

Deadlift: 495, 525, 545 (fail)

Total: 1180

So I ended up winning not only my weight class, but strongest overall lifter, and I actually had the highest absolute total by 55 pounds. One guy in the 207 class squatted and benched a bit more than me, but I have dat deadlift retard strength, and nobody came within 100 pounds of my dead. None of these lifts are close to my PRs (I hit a beautiful 305 paused bench like a month ago, and I've deadlifted 550 and squatted 385 fairly recently), so I was a little disappointed with my performance. I've been generally training like a pussy for the last month or so (and hadn't back squatted in several months due to various injuries), and with only a week's notice that the meet was happening, I didn't really have much time to prepare. Still, I took first place and absolutely crushed everybody else that competed, so I guess I did okay. I really enjoyed the experience overall and liked being in a competitive atmosphere, so I think I need to get my training in order and then do a real meet sanctioned by a federation.

I'll dive right into it since I'm tired and don't feel like typing more than needed:

* Squats
 * 140 kg / 308.6 lbs - *Good Lift*
 * 150 kg / 330.7 lbs - *Good Lift*
 * 155 kg / 341.7 lbs - *Good Lift*

 * Passed on 3rd attempt
* Deadlift
 * 185 kg / 407.8 lbs - *Good Lift*
 * 197.5 kg / 435.4 lbs - *Good Lift*
 * 205 kg / 451.9 lbs - *2 reds, no lift*

Total: 447.5 kg / 986.5 lbs @ 54.8 kg / 120.8 lbs bodyweight ([raw elite total - pdf warning](http://www.rawpowerlifting.com/pdf/RAWClassificationStandards.pdf)), 7/9 lifts.

I had been training for this meet since Raw Nationals back in August and I believe all the hard work paid off.  I finally strung together a raw elite total in a meet, and in an IPF judged event nonetheless.  I also had a very nice weigh-in weight and that combined with my total gave me an 11 point increase on my Wilks total for a 416.18 raw Wilks score.

I learned a lot about myself during the prep for this meet which began back in August, too much to type here (and considering my energy levels).  I also dealt with a right shoulder tweak several weeks out from the meet which really threw a wrench into my training and meet performance on bench press (209 was a grinder when I should have been able to put up 215 paused without an issue).  I did set a meet squat PR of ~342 lbs and had some left in the tank so I think I'll have to aim higher next time.  Deadlift was fine, adjusted my 2nd attempt to hit raw elite and then 3rd attempt for 1000 total, but I got 2 reds on that lift - the head judge gave me a white light, but the 2 side judges gave me reds so I believe it may have been for thigh support, but I can't say 100% because I didn't ask them.

Going forward, I'm going to take some time off of *competitive* powerlifting since this meet mentally drained me.  I'll still PL, but don't have my sights on another meet for another 1-2 years.  I'd like to use that time to work on the Olympic lifts (maybe try a meet or two there), increase my conditioning, get back into rowing for cardio, and really work on my flexibility and form.  I also plan on leaning out a bit more (target is 116 lbs) then starting a slow bulk and running some volume programs for squat and bench (I have the 13-week smolov squat program in my sights).

I'd like to give a special shout-out to the FCJ crew for coming out to support me.  They were frickin awesome and cheering at every opportunity.  Even the announcer mentioned that I had a fan club in the crowd, and their support really did help.  There are too many people to list without forgetting some so I'd like to give a general but extremely sincere thank you to everyone who has supported me along this journey to the Arnold.

It has now been over 24 hrs since the meet and every part of me hurts, I am mentally and physically drained (despite eating non-stop yesterday, and I do mean that), and my head has exploded multiple times from the ridiculous (both good and bad) things and people I have seen at the Expo at the Arnold Sports Festival.  I'll be around to answer any questions if anyone has any.  Thanks for taking time to read this.

For strongman, if you ignore the first 2 winners of World's Strongest Man (before Kaz and before the sport became a bit more formal), the average age of winners for their *final* win is roughly 31.2. The range of age runs from 24 for Jon Pall to 37 for Zydraunas this year. (The average age of the Arnolds at last victory is 29.3, but Savickas won the thing 5 years out of 11 total, so take the average as you will.)

For Olympic lifting back to 1976 (after clean and press was dropped and well into steroid era), the average age of the SHW class gold winner at age of oldest victory was 27. This has trended younger over time, as there hasn't been an over 26 year old winner since 1996. Average middle age gold (at age of last victory) has been 23.5, with a 19 year old in there and no one over 28. This trended older over time. 

Average age of IPF gold medal SHW winners [from here](http://www.powerlifting-ipf.com/46.html) is 30.1. This was the first category with an over 40 winner. I didn't do any other weight categories, but it would be interesting to see. I also didn't have data for years before 95. 

For reference to other sports, [the average of Superbowl winning quarterbacks is 30.](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d827e5959/article/manning-eyes-latercareer-push-for-super-bowl-glory). They probably didn't gauge for ""peak"", meaning, the oldest victory averaged as age, instead of averaging multiple victories in. 

Some thoughts: What is average age of training start for olympic lifting versus powerlifting and strongman? The latters seem to be something men take up after high school/collegiate athletics, while Olympic lifters seem to be schooled (nationally) from a young age. 

Olympics and IPF is more tested for drugs more than any strongman show. This isn't to say they are cleaner, just more likely to be clean. 

Any thing else I am missing?

So lets talk about getting out from under the bar when things just dont go right.


**Deadlifts**

This one is about as easy as it gets...let go of the bar. That's about it.


**Squat**

Squatting is an intimidating lift for many. A lot of people think that if they fail it will be a big deal, but the reality is, it wont be 99% of the time. Most people wont even notice. 

To fail a squat safely, setting up properly to begin with is critical. Before you squat, put the safety rails at the correct height. The ""correct height"" varies based on your height and squatting style, but you want them just below the lowest point the bar will reach. For me, that is about 4 rungs up if I am doing low bar squats with a wide stance. 3 rungs if I am doing high bar oly style squats. The rails end up an inch or two below the bar.

To find the height, put the empty bar on your shoulders, and squat down as deep as you can and look where the bar is. 

Now that the rails are in the right place, you are ready. Most failures are going to occur in the hole or just out of it. So when you fail, lower the weight down slowly (at a normal speed) and just set it on the rail. Lean forward slightly, and the bar will come over your head with no weight touching you and you will be in the clear. If you fail and are off balance, let the weight fall away from you, dont try to fight it once you lost that balance, just dump it and get out of it's way. The metal rails are much stronger than you, let them take the hit.

**Bench**

There are a couple of ways to fail out of a bench.

On the regular benches at my gym there are a set of catches below the spot the bar normally sits. You can see the in [this](http://www.fitness-equipment.com/acatalog/9512c.jpg) pic (this isn't the same bench, but the same hooks). These rest about an inch or so above my chest when I have a good arch. So as long as I can get the weight up slightly I can drop them on these, lay flat and I am gold. Bar sits safely above my head.

If I couldn't the weight to even that point (this means something REALLY bad happened as I would need to either be injured at this point or I was being REALLY stupid) I would lower the bar to my chest and either roll of shame it (at a high weight, I wouldnt do this) but I could just drop one side of the bar to the ground, and dump the whole thing off of me. This would suck so option 1 would be better. And finally, I could just hold it on my chest and call out for a spot, and likely somone would come.

If I was really pushing my self, I would just pull a flat bench into a power rack, set the safety rails right below my chest level (when arched) and put the hooks above that. If I fail for any reason, I would just drop the weight, the rails would catch it, I would lay flat and slide out.

**Overhead Press**

This is another easy fail. I OHP in a power rack, and like the squat, I just set the rails right below the low point in the lift, if I fail, I can drop them on there. But the reality is, in every failed attempted, I just lower it to the bottom of the lift and rerack the weight. No fuss about it. The rails are there in case I injure myself badly and can't control the weight.


That  is really all there is to it. If you have never failed a lift...you are either new, or not pushing yourself hard enough. In either case, practice failing a lift once or twice. Knowing that you can get out from under the bar safely will many times give you the confidence to push yourself harder.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,True,,,True,t3_kwbq3,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/kwbq3/how_to_fail/,

In her answer she states the following:

&gt;...when I went to Westside and Louie told me that I needed to spend more time benching with my feet up and without an arch, that has been one of the things that has made my bench jump up the most. Before, my bench was all leg drive. Now, I actually have some upper body strength.

Obviously incorporating leg drive into the bench is the goal when trying to lift the maximum amount of weight. But as Jennifer attested, developing pure upper body strength, without the aid of leg drive, will improve the bench press as well.

I'm wondering if there is any *relative* metric for comparing a powerlifting bench press (i.e. using leg drive) to a bench without leg drive. Should you be able to bench 80% of your max without using leg drive? Maybe 65-75%? I also understand that the severity of the arching will effect this metric as well. For example, the picture of Jen at the top of the article shows a very significant arching, which her butt almost or completely off the bench.

I apologize in advance if this has been addressed previously or elsewhere (search for anything with ""leg drive"" just brings up articles talking about how to incorporate it) and I just can't find it.

Dive-bombing.

This is *not* OK. That some elite lifters do it some of the time does not excuse *you*.

**The Squat vs the Clean receive**

Part of the confusion comes from the fact that in clean receives, we aim to ride the bounce out of the hole. This is because, in the C&amp;J event, we are aiming to preserve as much leg strength as possible for the jerk. The clean is already very taxing on the legs; and most C&amp;J attempts fail on the jerk. It is critical to preserve as much power as possible.

The squat, however, is a strength exercise. That is its purpose. And you rob yourself of important training stimulus if you dive-bomb. You must *resist the bar* on the way down and dominate it on the way up or you are, in my opinion, not fully squatting.

For starters, you are losing the entire eccentric portion of the lift. Developing force while lengthening is a powerful way to stimulate hypertrophy; which yes, matters to Oly lifters wanting to get strong.

Secondly, you train yourself to *rely* on the bounce. And it won't always be there. Unless you are legitimately strong in the first half out of the hole (which is the toughest part of the lift), you cannot save a missed bounce. You'll get pinned under the bar, which is probably about as embarrassing as it gets for Oly lifters (you might be mistaken for a Crossfitter).

Finally, it's dangerous. By dive bombing you give the bar a chance to build up momentum -- momentum which your body will need to arrest suddenly. This means that you run the risk of breaking form in the most disadvantageous position of the squat. Don't do that.

**What about the Snatch?**

The bounce is less important for the snatch. Firstly, there's no need to preserve leg strength -- the snatch is done as soon as you stand up with aligned feed and control of the bar. Secondly, the snatch will be less weight than the clean and your squat. Raw leg strength is rarely the limiting factor for getting out of the hole.

And perhaps most importantly, balance. The snatch is a balancing trick -- putting up a shit ton of weight on two skinny sticks. Often it's necessary to sit in the hole while the bar stabilises. There's no point shooting up if the bar isn't aligned properly overhead; that just amplifies the unbalanced nature of the system.

**So, to Recap:**

Resist the bar on the way down. Don't be a superslow dipshit ... just *resist* it. Enough to show the bar who's boss.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1343490380.0,,,True,t3_sz6wr,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/sz6wr/resist_the_bar/,

So we have seen how Crossfit pairs nicely with the Muppet show and how being mediocre at everything gets you nowhere. Let's now look at the polar opposite, specializing in something. In this instance, let's post up some good links so as to learn the Power Clean, a great exercise to build power, strength and some good muscle mass.

I am not talking about guidelines written by people who can't power clean themselves out of a paperbag or who use the same form as your typical Xfitter. Rather, it'd be great if we can get a collection of nice tutorials/guidelines/how-to's written by guys who are proficient in this lift/are olympic lifters/know what they are talking about.

I'll start:

1318858192.0,71,self.weightroom,lf3d5,"Oly lifter, Y U NO DEADLIFT?",jacques_chester,79,8,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/lf3d5/oly_lifter_y_u_no_deadlift/,"A few times here in weightroom and in fittit I've mentioned in comments that I have basically given up deadlifting. This is, in general weight training terms, heresy. A bit like announcing you like boobie mags onstage at the World Feminist Union annual conference. Just not done.

I should preface my comments by pointing out that like every field of human endeavour, there are no absolute 'best' ways of doing things. Or rather, in spite of what is agreed on, there are always disagreements. 

For example, it's not controversial in the wider ironslinging community that weightlifters don't do bench presses. But even this has exceptions. Some Russian-style programs, perhaps as a hangover from the clean &amp; press days or as a sop to accomodation, do rotate the bench press into the mix from time to time.

But to forswear deadlifting? What madness is this? Why O Why would an Oly lifter give up deadlifting?

Here's three reasons why.

**Pattern Interference**

The big reason is: deadlifts are similar enough to cleans to cause motor pattern interference, but different enough that it will fuck up heavy cleans.

In my personal case, even deadlifting once per week is enough to make my cleans utterly unreliable. As soon as the weight gets heavy I start deadlifting them instead of cleaning them. This happens sometimes even now, when I don't deadlift. Cleaning a heavy weight is stressful enough, but it must eventually become a fluid, barely conscious effort. Frequent deadlifting interferes with that.

Plus the mechanics of the deadlift are different. A powerlifter will optimise their starting position differently. For an Oly lifter the goal is to bring the bar smoothly past the knee while retaining a constant back angle and keeping the weight over the heel. And that's all. Shortening the bar travel distance, or putting the centre of gravity backwards, are simply not considerations. The clean starting position usually shows a lower bum and more elevated shoulders than a deadlift start.

When I first read Rippetoe's chapter in SS on deadlifts, I began changing my clean style. Later I realised I was a dipshit because the clean and the deadlift are different lifts. Worrying about putting my shoulder blades over the bar is less important than worrying about keeping the weight over my heels. It's a different style and I want and need to specialise.

**Maximal Force vs Rate of Force Development**

The next difference between deadlifting and cleans or snatches is that at the high level, they rely on different adaptations.

At an elite level, the deadlift is a test of maximal force production, of the lifter's limit strength. And in that regard I have *nothing but respect* for powerlifters. In terms of limit strength, powerlifters are stronger than weightlifters, end of discussion.

But limit strength is not the ultimate adaptive aim of the weightlifter. What we require is the ability to produce as much force as possible in the shortest time possible. That's power, in a physics sense. The underlying property is called Rate of Force Development, or RFD.

You can't grind up a snatch. Either you impart enough momentum to the bar on the correct vector or you don't. There is, as famous weightlifting coach Yoda puts it, ""no try"".

Not that limit strength is worthless. Limit strength can, with careful training, be transferred to RFD. And vice versa, having a well-developed RFD can improve the expression of limit strength. If you can reach your max force output in less time, you are less likely to fail a max-effort deadlift due to running out of energy in the sarcomeres.

But ultimately, there's a point beyond which absolute limit strength is no longer adaptive. It's still a necessary input, but not the ultimate aim. Weightlifters can convert well to powerlifting due to their excellent RFD, but they will need time to catch up on limit strength. The highest-ranked weightlifters cannot deadlift as much as the highest-ranked powerlifters, and that's OK.

**There Are Better Alternatives**

Finally, for the motor patterns that an Oly lifter uses that the deadlift develops, there are better alternatives.

I don't mean ""better for all purposes"". For a powerlifter, a strongman or just a general athlete in some other sport, the deadlift is a must. It is an excellent developer of total body strength.

But for Oly lifting, it's all about *speed*. So instead of deadlifting to develop the posterior chain, we use other exercises.

*Pulls*

The most important of these are the pulls. The clean pull and the snatch pull simulate a snatch or clean up to the beginning of the third pull -- ie, up to the shrug. These are not deadlifts with a shrug at the end. They are pulls. They are meant to be performed precisely and *quickly* with supermaximal loads. It's common to see schemes within 110-130% of the 1RM of the clean or snatch being performed for triples or doubles. 

Not only do pulls develop strength and power through the positions, they also develop comfort and confidence for pulling 1RMs off the floor.

*RDLs*

I've written [elsewhere](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/kleur/some_words_about_the_romanian_deadlift/) about the magical back-strength properties of the RDL. It really kicks a hundred kinds of butt and no serious strength trainee should leave it out of their overall program.

For an Oly lifter, the RDL trains two key things:

1. Back rigidity under dynamic load. The deadlift does this too, but the RDL just bams it up another notch.
2. Sweeping the bar back. Properly performed RDLs require you to constantly pull the bar towards you, primarily using the lats. This is an important requirement for both the competition lifts also, to keep the bar over the feet.

The hamstring effects are really not the goal for an Oly lifter. It's nice and all that, but if the hammies are deficient then the Oly's go-to lifts are straight-legged deadlifts and good mornings. It's all about that rigid back and active lats.

*Deadlift partials*

Sometimes it's useful to train the two classic deadlift partials. Knee-stopped deadlifts are great for training back tightness in the first pull and developing comfort with pull heavy weight off the ground while losing the little voice that says ""holy fuck that's heavy"", causing you to wimp out on the lift.

Rack pulls are good for useful for developing an aggressive second pull with supermaximal weight. It's useful as an occasional alternative to cleans or snatches from the knee or mid-thigh.

*An aside on grip work*

Oly lifters generally don't need grip endurance. We need to be able to resist the hand opening for maybe 2 seconds tops. And oddly enough, squeezing the living daylights out of the bar is a *bad* thing, because it tenses up the elbows. Tensing up the elbows slows the movement of the arms as a whole and before long you're aborting everything that isn't a power clean. One of the neat things about the hook grip is that while it increases gripping ability, it actually loosens the forearm muscles.

Go ahead, try it. Grab a bar orthodox style and feel your forearm. Now try it with a hook grip. Notice the difference?

The practical upshot is that when Oly lifters do RDLs, partials, pulls etc, we break out the straps. We don't want the systemic stimulus to be constrained by the ability  of our forearms to keep a fist closed for a minute or two, and using the hook grip with heavy weights for a long time is a great way to kill nerves in the thumb (hint: not awesome).

Last week I stumbled across [this Q&amp;A from Zane Geeting](http://asp.elitefts.net/qa/default.asp?qid=171358&amp;tid=94) in which he describes how letting your wrists fall back can lead to shoulder/biceps pain.

So I go to bench on Tuesday and, lo and behold, my wrists are falling back when I tuck my elbows. On subsequent sets I mentally cue punching the ceiling (keeping wrists stacked) and end up having a lot more power during the transition from chest to lockout. Ended up with a 5 lbs 1RM pr. When I went to bench again today, I brought my grip in a bit and again worked on punching the ceiling. Zero shoulder pain and a 3RM pr. 

Why am I calling this tip counterintuitive? Well, we've all heard the cue to squeeze the bar as hard as you can. Biomechanically, the grip is strongest with the wrist in slight extension. The finger flexors get a nice mechanical advantage at the carpal tunnel and the extensors are unloaded so we're not fighting ourselves. However, this is *not* what one should be trying to achieve with the squeeze cue. The squeeze is about generating tension to stabilize the forearm and elbow, and in order to get that tension, you want load in both flexors and extensors. In other words, you want your wrist stacked and loaded like you're going to punch the ceiling.

Wrist wraps are obviously going to help keep the wrist in proper position if your forearms are weak, but they won't do the job by themselves. Cue punching the ceiling and keep the wrists stacked as you tuck your elbows and see where it gets you.

Keep in mind that it just came out three days ago so I haven't had the time to go over each page in excruciating detail.

[Non-affiliate Amazon link to the book](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Supple-Leopard-Preventing-Performance/dp/1936608588)

It's 400 pages of condensed fucking awesome. 

The $40 cost is hefty but the money is put to good use. The hardcover binding and paper quality are very good and there's only a handful of pages in the book without a picture or illustration of some kind. The language used strikes a good balance between lay person and technical without sacrificing too much in the process.

The opening sections deal with neutral positioning for every joint in the body with various positions and drills that I can see being an immense help to someone just starting with no idea what a 'neutral spine' or 'collapsed arch' is. 

The meat of the book is divided between the movement categories and joint and muscle mobility. Exercises are divided into three categories based on movement skills. This includes proper technique, common errors and the specific mobility weaknesses. This includes all of the basic Crossfit, powerlifting and Olympic Weightlifting exercises.

The joint by joint and muscle by muscle mobility section is extremely well done. I wasn't sure how well the . The picture demonstrations are taken from the right angles and each position of the mobs has an explanation. There's a little primer in the beginning detailing all the equipment used but with just a heavy band and lacrosse ball you can do about 85% of the mobs in the book.

Right now the biggest complaint that I can see is that there's really no integration with the MobilityWOD page. It gets a mention in the intro of the book and the last page is dedicated to it and that's about it. For visual learners like myself this is a big negative and given the haphazard nature the site and Youtube page are organized in it's going to take some serious Google Fu to find the stretch you're looking for even with the proper name.

Definitely looking forward to spending some more time studying this and I can now forgive KStar for taking a 6+ month break from making any new MobilityWODs.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_1d61y5,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1d61y5/becoming_a_supple_leopard_by_kelly_starrett_first/,

It'd been a while since I'd had a genuinely shitty squat session, and I didn't quite know how best to respond. I ended up making it through my sets by doing some mobility work between sets, and brining in my stance for my back off sets.

Instead of doing my normal accessory work, I thought that if I flushed my muscles with blood and get a good stretch, it could help me feel better and prevent another shit session. So I did 20+ rep sets of leg curls, the adductor-abductor machine, back extensions, ab wheel rollouts, plus a series of planks. I left the gym tired but feeling a little better.

I've been slacking on conditioning to be honest, though on light days I'll superset every bit of light assistance work I can think of for high reps (and it gets my heart rate up), it still doesn't feel the same as the days when I'd do 20-30 hill sprints. Luckily, I work a physical job during the weekend which still has me moving quickly and is probably the only reason I don't get winded (and I do steady state for 30-45 min 1-2 a week). I haven't gotten fatter at all, and I'm convinced conditioning isn't necessary for fat loss but I hate being the guy that just lifts and doesn't run.

I do have this idea of getting another sandbag, fill it with 25kg and just run up and down the stairs in my apartment building. It will suck ass in all probability, but Gary Taylor used to do that shit with a 100kg bag so I gotta step my game up.

I looked around online and found a good deal on shoes and a singlet through monstermuscle.com

I got an email confirming the order from them and they said they'd ship within 5 days (which seemed a little lengthy) and promised a call if the order would take longer. That was Dec 5th. I had heard nothing and so on Dec 14th I emailed them, asking for any sort of update on my order. When no response came I took a claim to paypal and emailed them informing them of my action.

I tried to get in contact via phone, but there were no numbers on the website, and the numbers associated with the company on the old website and through the BBB were all disconnected.

This is a warning, I've honestly never had such terrible customer service from a company, and I don't want anyone else to have to deal with this. Now, if you have had experience with them that was positive, I'd love to hear it, but I'm a very proactive customer, and I don't like when companies fail to follow through with things. I don't mind getting something bungled if they manage to fix it.

To contrast, I had an order from EFTS a little while back in which the poster I ordered arrived pretty tattered and the knee sleeves were the wrong size. They comp'd the return on the sleeves and sent me the right size and a new poster.

The thing I've learned is: the internet is a powerful place. I looked for reviews of monstermuscle.com and found none, so I hope that by putting this out there I maybe save somebody else the time and trouble.

EDIT: wow, this place is either really dead or people are really interested in this. I just wanted to get a list of sites to go to started:


**GOOD**  
elitefts.com (probably my #1 in terms of what they have and their customer service. They don't always have the best prices, but they do have some of the coolest stuff)  
houseofpain.com (endorsed by xtc46- informed him of a delay in shipping)

I want to ask you the following question:
**Do you think it's a good idea to try and learn the big lifts (bench, squat, deadlift, press) on your own?**

The reason I'm asking: I've been lifting in a commercial gym for maybe six months and the mentality there is that beginners should do a split routine using 90% machines from the get go. However I'm way more interested in the bigger movements which provide more than just mirror muscles. Since it seems to me that the coaches there have no real interest in teaching the complicated free-weight lifts (and think that people should be doing machine exercises) I got myself a copy of Starting Strength, read it and started to squat while keeping the weight quite low. My form is probably horrible but I'm willing to put in the work to learn it.

But - without someone to coach me hands on - is it a good idea to try and figure out how to do the big lifts or will it do more harm than good (i.e. injuries, grinding in the bad form etc.)? If you think it can be done, what would be the best way to do it?

Thanks in advance for any answers

With the medical bills passing $100k, the good folks at CrossFit Monterey agreed to host a fundraiser to help make a dent in those bills. Lifters came from as far away as Sacramento to raise money and smash PR's. 

Here's the video of most of my lifts: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7DWwClqHrk 

Background and Training
I've been competing in strongman for years and recently switched to powerlifting. I used the Cube method for 10 weeks then did a meet on 4/7. The accident with my daughter happened on 4/10 so I flew out to Albuquerque to be with her. We got home on 4/21 and I only trained twice before the event.

Meet Prep
Recovery and sleep were shit. I think it was partly due to the stress of having my daughter in the hospital, eating out every meal, and not training. I wasn't sure what kind of affect that was going to have on my numbers but I wanted to give it my all anyway. I was sick Monday and Tuesday. 

The Lifts
Squat
475lbs, make: EZ PZ
515lbs, make: Also PZ
545lbs, make: 27lb PR

Strict Overhead Press:
245lbs, make: Was already warmed up from the squats so this was actually my first warmup rep on the pressing too. 
275lbs, make: a little stall halfway up, but got it
285lbs, miss: Lost it in front

Deadlift
633lbs, make: Wasn't feeling great but the weights were moving quickly enough to give me some confidence.
672lbs, make: I still couldn't tell what I could max at for the day, but I knew I wanted to try for a PR
713lbs, make: A bit of a grinder, but no hitching. It got away from me a little bit on the right side but thanks to doing snatch grip deads for the last 10 weeks, my upper back was strong enough to pull it back in line. 8lb PR.

Results
Squat PR, deadlift PR, 1533lb total. Highest total of the meet.

Final thoughts
More important than my total was that we raised almost $6,000 for my daughter's medical expenses. I was really blown away by the amount of people who came and supported our family. Many people donated flat amounts and others donated pledges per pound lifted. Just humbled and grateful for the strength community.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_1dchoh,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1dchoh/meet_report_team_courtney_crossfit_total_monterey/,

Gender: Male

BW: Walk around @ 170, dropped to 163 for compeitition. 

Experience: Been powerlifting 7 years, first compeitition. Lve about 10 minutes away from the high school where the competition was held, which was nice.

Squat: First attempt: 363. Easy Peasy. I was completely relaxed all day, and I got a shot of adrenaline as soon as my hands touched the bar the first time. I knocked this one out. 

Second: 403 - Matched my PR on squat. This one felt great as well. Afterwards, I was light headed, and my friend grabbed my arm, went over to the booth, and picked out 418 for me. I'm glad he did, because I could barely think at all in the 30 seconds after this lift. 

Third: I dropped, felt good. Pushed up, stalled. The entire crowd cheered me on, and I hit it. It felt awesome. Squats are my strongest lift, and I was 50 pounds up! Talking to the other 5-6 165ers, I knew winning  the 165s would be a lot tougher than I thought. A guy drove in from Tennesee(hit 373) and another from NC(hit 373 as well) - so they were tough competition and had impressive openers for the other two lifts

Bench: 220, easy peasy. Wasnt nervous at all. 

Second: I picked 238, a 3 ILB PR. This was hard, but I got it, didnt grind. 

Third: Picked 248 over 243. I felt good about the 10 pound jump. I missed this, stalled about 5 inches off the chest, and flamed out. No shame, I pushed myself. My competitors got 248(both of them), making me 33 pounds up going into deadlift.

Deadlift: First: 455. This was fairly easy. I spend about 15 seconds adjusting my hands. I did sumo. Felt great and easy. My competitors did 440 and 485 respectively.

Second: I did 496, grinded a little.  My previous PR was 486. Going into the meet, I had my eyes set at the state record of 530, but my two friends convinced me I should go for winning the competition. A failed 535 would give me neither the record, nor the competition. I picked 513 for my second attempt, forcing them both to hit 546 to beat me. They hit 496 and 506 respectively on their second lifts, making me 23 and 33 pounds up, respectively.

Third attempt: My competitiors picked 523 and 513 for their third lifts, meaning I had won! I think the lack of motivation was a big relief(in a bad way) - I walked out there knowing I had won, and I was too relaxed. I missed the lift. I'm not sure I would have gotten it if the competition was on the line, but I would have had a better chance. I wish I hadn't known what my competitors had chosen. Next time I'll try not to know. They hit 523 and 513 respectively, and I won by 6 pounds, and 16 pounds. Good for them!! 


Recap: I hit PRs, and I made weight. I went with the strategy of First attempt: Easy Second attempt: PR or close to it. Third attempt: Higher than second by 10(Bench) 20(squat/DL). Towards the end, I realized how much winning meant to me, and I went for the victory rather than the ego-satisfying state record. I'm glad I did. Competiting was really fun, and I look to do it again.

Next Meet: August 10, New Brunswick, NJ(1 day after my 25th Birthday)

Peace!

I personally believe continual maintenance of muscle and connective tissue to be necessary to stay injury free and continue lifting with proper mechanics. For this I've found [Mobilitywod.com](http://mobilitywod.com) to be invaluable. Kelly Starrett is a mobility genius. He tends to spew lots of babble and talks really fast but what's important are the exercises and approaches to mobility he teaches.

The majority of the mobs can be done with the following pieces of equipment:

* Lacrosse balls (tennis ball works in a pinch)
* Jump-stretch band
* Something to anchor the band overhead and near the ground (I use a pullup bar for overhead work and my bed posts for ground work)
* Foam roller 
* Occasionally he'll use a barbell to mash some shoulder tissue or a kettlebell/weight as an anchor

Here are some examples of Mobs:

* Two I do everytime I lift to [Loosen up my shoulders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eveYJP1indI&amp;feature=player_embedded) and [Open up my hips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBHzXF-mVjY&amp;feature=youtu.be)

* [Attacking the hamstrings with a lacrosse ball](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQtwaPoK-UM)

Tight in a particular area? Search the site and I guarantee you'll find a mob to address your issues. Spend thirty minutes a day doing mobility work and I bet you'll feel better and have better mechanics.

All measurements are imperial and we stopped counting the results after about 825 people. Metric users and late comers, now is an excellent time to learn that life is unfair.

Let's get the important thing out of the way first: How much stronger are we than r/fitness? Refresh your memory of their [sub par results](http://i.imgur.com/O3szT.png).

Now, without further ado,  here are the results, organized by weight class.

[Male Raw Powerlifting](http://i.imgur.com/Lj8F3.png)

[Female Raw Powerlifting](http://i.imgur.com/h9W2E.png)

[Male Weightlifting](http://i.imgur.com/cyO0L.png)

[Female Weightlifting](http://i.imgur.com/5RxxX.png)

Blank spots are indicative of a lack of responses for that category. We had *very* few female responses so take that data with a grain of salt or twenty.

Because of the massive amount of male raw powerlifter responses, we (and by we I mean svunt because I'm far too dumb for this shit) decided to break it down further.

[Here you can see how height](http://i.imgur.com/fPylK.png) factors into the equation, as well as how you compare with people of similar heights and weights. All height measurements are in inches.

[Here you can see the effect that the age of the trainee](http://i.imgur.com/FgeIz.png) has on their 1 rep maxes.

If you're interested, you can also download the [pivot tables](http://www.sendspace.com/file/aa8r89) (again, shoutout to svunt) and see how you compare to people of similar ages and heights. This data is available for all the lifters, male, female, oly and PL.

If you want to download the completely [raw survey data](http://www.sendspace.com/file/tg3pd4) and do something else with these results, please feel free.

As for the equipped data, at the time that we started gathering the data we only had 6 responses, two of which were complete.

Takeaways:

* The taller you are, the worse your numbers are likely to be at a given weight.

* A handful of really strong women is enough to completely skew the results of a survey.

* People *really, really* suck at following directions.

* r/fitness is weak and we are superior.

The sub is growing and doing so pretty quick, which is awesome. One of the most common posts here are form checks, so before things really pick up I wanted to get a few standards in place so we can make this as easy as possible (for the poster and for the people giving the advice). So here is how we want form checks done.



**Text Posts Only (not links to youtube)** - Just because. Explain the lift you are doing, the weight, etc. 

I'm sick of form checks where I need to guess what the guy is attempting only to find he then left a comment about the lift.



**Subject:** Include [Form Check] - LiftName - WeightUsed




**Text:**

* Height / Weight
* Lift being done (for squat, specify high or low bar)
* Current 1RM
* Weight being used
* Link to video(s)
* Whatever questions you have about your form if any.



**Video Standards**

* Rotate the video properly. Your head should be in the top half of the frame for deadlifts, squats and overhead presses, not on the left or right side
* Full body (foot position is critical in all lifts)
* If you are in a rack, rails cannot block the hip section
* AT LEAST 3 reps, unless it is a 1RM attempt, in which case you should also submit a video of you doing reps at a lower weight. You just can't judge form well with a single rep.


**Video** 

* Side angle is best for pretty much all lifts, you can post additional angles if you want, but facing the camera for a deadlift is less useful.
* You and the bar + weights should always be in frame.
* Make sure lighting is good if possible. When it isnt, wear clothes that are easy to see form in. (example: Don't wear a black t-shirt and black pants in poor lighting, you can't see your hip joint, etc)
* 1 lift per video when possible. You can post multiple videos in a single link, but having to watch you do 7 lifts is a waste of time if I am only going to comment on 1. (Example: I don't know shit about Oly form, so I will never comment on it, but I do know stuff about squats...so I will watch your squat vids)


**Pro Tips:**

[Gorilla Pods](http://joby.com/gorillapod) are awesome for in gym shooting. 


**Notes on commenting on form:**

* If you aren't familiar with the lift, you have no business commenting on the form 99.999% of the time. I NEVER want to see ""I didn't know what this lift was, so I googled it and....""



Anything you guys want to add/change?

**Meet Prep:**

I had a full six months to train for this meet, but unfortunately did not end up training for all of that time.  At the conclusion of my [last meet](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/12ben2/meet_report_nasa_iowa_regional_2012_1228_lbs_at/), although I did not mention it, I sustained a pretty serious back injury that prevented me from doing any of the competition lifts .  Naturally I did not go see a doctor and instead decided to rehab whatever was wrong with my lower back with fish oil, pulling a sled, and reverse hypers.  It worked out well and towards the end of November I could front squat pain free upwards of 95% of my 1RM ; however I still couldn't low bar 95lbs.  Bench pressing was also a no-go, but about a month after the incident of only doing dips I started floor pressing regularly and worked my way back up to higher intensities.  That continued until about mid December and ultimately my floor press maxed out at 260 (equal to my bench max) and front squats got up to 350.

Finally in mid December I low barred 405 on a whim fairly easily but really felt it the next day and decided it wasn't meant to be yet.  Enter the high bar squat.  Despite its inherent evils, high bar squats, along with front squats, made up the majority of my training as I pushed my high bar max up to 440, just shy of my then meet PR, through mid January.  At the same time, I found I could deadlift pain free and started ramping up the intensity until I hit a [520 deficit deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brMtF9WYXp4) and a [550 deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qpe7b-lx-fQ).  At that time my back could finally handle sustained low bar squatting and competition style bench press.  

Considering how my squat had stalled prior to my injury, this go-around I decided to try out a bit of an auto-regulated block periodized training cycle for squat and bench press; deadlifts were more focused on RFD to focus on my speed off the floor to my knees which has always been lacking and used typical Westside rep schemes but without accommodating resistance which is wholly unnecessary given my strength on the lockout.  Based on how I felt that day, I would work up to a daily max (usually around 415 for squat and 235 for bench) and then do my work sets which ranged from 3-6 sets for 5-10 reps.  That may not seem like high volume for an accumulation phase, but for somebody who was used to doing singles, it was pretty freaking hard.  

That continued until about a month and a half out from competition where I then transitioned to more of an intensification cycle with a similar number of sets, but fewer reps at higher intensities to focus on pure strength and that was then followed by a transition to a realization period where I really upped the weights and hit [this sweet 465 squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWTf0MjkCn8).  Unfortunately the final two weeks before the competition really stuck it to me with exams and lab reports and I didn't lift at all the final eight days before the meet which proved to be a detriment on competition day.  On top of that, this entire semester I've been waking up at 4:30 five days a week for my internship with the S&amp;C department, so the early mornings coupled with the late nights really did a number on me that week.  On the bright side, I was down to 160 the day of weigh ins without cutting because I didn't have time to eat.  

**Meet Day:**

Definitely felt the week lay-off I took.  Everything on my back past 315 felt twice as heavy as normal, but it started to feel better the more I warmed up.  The sweet, sweet nectar of the gods, Jack3d, also helped.  Just based on my force-velocity curve for squats, everything past a certain weight looks like the same speed despite the weight.  Thus the relatively smooth looking 457 in the video, but the 468 I called for on my third going absolutely nowhere.  

408, 457, 468(X)

Bench...meh.  Volume training really didn't seem to do anything for me and it was just a so-so day but the weights felt good.

231, 248, 259

Deadlift felt freaking awesome on warm ups.  Everything was fast and strong.  I am really used to Eleiko bars though and the Texas Deadlift Bars really tore up my hands (first world problems...).  My opener felt strong as shit but it ripped a bunch of skin off my thumbs.  I taped up for my second attempt at 551 and got to about the knees before the tape ripped.  Holy mother of god, never again.  Instantly dropped it when the tape ripped without even having time to think about what I was doing.  At that point I was pretty pissed because I knew I was good for more, but didn't want to attempt something and fail and walk away with just a 496 deadlift so I called for 551 again, packed the holes in my thumbs with chalk and pulled that son of a bitch to lockout.

496, 551(X), 551

**Thoughts Going Forward:**

It would have been the bee's knees to total 1300, but I ended up being about 11lbs short on each lift, so maybe in July.  That being said, 1267 at 165 is good enough to qualify as Candidate for Master of Sport according to the Sheiko guy, so that's pretty neat.  475 on squat and 570 on deadlift are the two big training goals of this next cycle and I do think they are attainable.  I'm not sure what the plan for bench is yet, but I'll figure something out.  Given how well my squat and deadlfit both responded to the quad work I got front squatting (something I think a lot of powerlifters are lacking, myself included), this accumulation cycle is going to feature a lot of front squats, RFE split squats, and eccentric portions to really bolster my quad strength as well as a bigger focus on hamstring strength with RDLs and GHRs due to their relative weakness to my erectors.

Plus, I gotta beat the Sunday /r/weightroom meet report rush. I tried to be concise but I failed, sorry.

As the title indicates, this didn't go how I'd hoped, but I learned a lot and I'm optimistic going forward. I really wanted a 300 Wilks, but such is life.

**Background**

I've competed before, last summer (totalling 490 at 123) and in the fall (totalling 525 at 132, did not feel like cutting because reasons). I decided to do this meet because one of my roller derby teammates who got into lifting through crossfit had signed up for it with a bunch of people from her gym. I signed up and tagged along, excited to actually do a meet with a friend instead of being all forever alone.

I've been ""lifting"" for a few years... I had done SS/some variant of linear progression, fucked around for awhile, broke my ankle, fucked around some more, never ate enough, etc. In January 2012 I committed to doing 5/3/1 and did that for most of the year. In the late fall I switched to Steve P.'s Ironsport Strength program. I did Smolov Jr. for my bench leading up to this meet because I had done it before and made good gains. I was really hoping that with getting my weight down and my bench up I could bench bodyweight, but as you'll see it was not in the cards. I think eating at a deficit while running that much volume just... didn't work. Previous gym PRs were 205/115/250. Goals for today were a) make the 123s b) squat 200+ c) bench bodyweight d) deadlift double bodyweight. I achieved half of these.

**Making weight**

I was walking around at 130 about a month ago, a little heavier than I'd like. I decided to see if I could make the 123s without losing too much strength, and then hopefully maintain in the mid- to high-120s after that. I stuck to about 1800 cals, which may not sound like much of a deficit for someone my size, but keep in mind I also play roller derby and walk everywhere. Weighed 126 earlier this week. I water loaded all week and then cut carbs late on Thursday, cut water late on Friday. Didn't really mess around with my sodium too much, I suck at tracking shit. Took a hot bath at the hotel Friday night, almost barfed everywhere, and weighed in at 55.8kg.

Then I re-hydrated and shoveled in some carbs at the hotel's unappetizing free breakfast, gaining 6 lbs in an hour.

**The Meet**

This was a pretty big meet, over 80 lifters and 2 platforms. There was sometimes some confusion between the two platforms over who was lifting next, was the weight loaded, etc., but they kept everything moving at a decent pace. There were 2 whole flights of women, which makes me happy.

**The Lifts (lbs/kg)**

[Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgQTrbC2pSs)

*Squats*

* 187/85 no lift (depth)

* 187/85 good

* 198/90 no lift (depth)

*Bench*

* 105/47.5 good

* 115/52.5 good

* 121/55 no lift (just too weak)

*Deadlift*

* 231/105 good

* 248/112.5 no lift (just. wouldn't. budge. ugh)

* 248/112.5 GOOD! double bodyweight :)

**Results**

2nd place in a weight class of 2. ha. She beat me by about 15 lbs? She was really cool and I had a nice time chatting with her. She also got best female lifter!

**What I learned**

Obviously, I need to squat deeper. The first attempt is clearly above parallel, I knew it before I racked it, and the weight is not that hard for me. I made sure to sink it deep for my second. On the third I really thought I hit parallel. Hard to see much in the video, but regardless, I need to be squatting to the judge's standards. I train alone, so this was a huge wake-up call that I NEED to be filming myself more, as awkward as it is.

That second deadlift... deadlifting always takes a lot of patience for me, and I think when it didn't move off the floor right away I got frustrated and gave up. This was dumb. But I'm glad I nailed it on the third and got double bodyweight.

I was also glad to learn I could cut that weight without losing my strength... I matched my PR's for bench and deadlift, and I had the strength for a 200 lb squat, I just effed it up. The cut also wasn't too painful, so I feel more confident going forward.

Going forward I am planning to try out /u/gzcl's programming. I really like the flexibility and concept of training to making a goal weight *easy*. I want to clean up my form (especially on squats) and build my confidence by not frequently pushing for a max and missing lifts. Any and all advice is welcome!

Side note: I am super proud of my teammate and friend who also lifted today, in the SHW class. She has only been lifting for a year and is making great progress. She set a bench PR (~150??) but missed the rack command due to excitement, and PR'd her deadlift at 350. Much thanks to her for indulging my need to film all the things.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1365309444.0,,,True,t3_1bu4f9,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1bu4f9/meet_report_usapl_richmond_open_550lbs249kg_total/,

Proving Ground Classic, Russellville AR

**Preparation:**  I knew my bench was going to suck, because I hurt my shoulder over the summer while rock climbing, and haven't been able to flat bench for months without pain.  So, I've basically neglected my chest for months just trying to get my shoulder to quit being shitty.  Discovered I could do dumbbell bench without any pain and started working on that about 2 weeks ago.

I had recently pushed my max squat from 250 to 300ish, so I just focused on trying hit some heavy singles and doubles that past couple weeks, getting used to maximal attempts.

However, while pushing my squat up with high volume for a couple months, I had let my deadlift go.  I could barely DL 330 three weeks ago.  Again, more heavy singles trying to get used to DLing heavy again.

I've weighed 167 ish all week, and was scared I wasn't going to make 165.  So, last night, I set up a ghetto sauna in my hotel room.  I used the method Kroc uses, as outlined by Jamie Lewis on Chaos and Pain.

**The Meet:**  I show up, and weigh in at 160.4.  Turns out that sauna shit works great, as I only went through a few cycles of it.  I downed a Gatorade and some water trying to get a little juice in me.

I ended up in the 2nd flight on squat.  It was my first time squatting with a fat bar, and it felt weird as fuck on my back.  First time using a monolift also.

Squat:  250, 280, 310(FAILED)

The 250 and 280 felt easy, but I got really intimidated with 310.  As easy as 280 was, I should have lifted 310.  But I didn't.

Moving on to bench, I was in the 3rd flight, and I think the weakest male lifter there.

Bench:  175, 195, 205.

The 205 was surprisingly easy, and went up without much trouble.  Probably could have 210 or 215, but whatever.

I was in the 3rd flight of deads.  Here, I actually outlifted some guys, and didn't completely suck ass.

Dead:  375, 400, 415(FAILED)

The 375 was just a peanut, and the 400 was tough.  I should have pulled 415, but didn't lock in my upper back tight enough.



Overall, I totaled 885 in the 165, with no belt or wraps (completely fucking raw).  I got 2nd place, and 1st place was some manlet who trashed me.

**Mistakes:**  I cut way too goddamn much.  Didn't realize the ghetto sauna was that effective.  Also, I didn't understand the flights and tried to warm up with 1st flight.  One of the guys running the monolift kindly told me he thought I should be in the 2nd flight warm-ups with my opener.  A little embarrassing.


**What I learned:**  I need to work on my fucking bench and squat.  My squat depth was crazy deep compared to everybody else, so I need to learn how to keep it a little higher for competitions.

tl;dr  280 S, 205 B, 400 D.  Got 2nd in my weight class.

""Do I even lift?""  etc...

**EDIT**  To keep the post in accordance with the official subreddit rules, I humbly ask where you guys think I should go next as far as training goes.  Should I do Smolov Jr. for squat?  What should I do about weak bench?  Just go to town with dumbbells and maybe one heavy barbell bench session a week, and hope my shoulder takes it ok?

Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday we do quite a bit of volume, right now mostly doubles and triples.  Much of the work is variations of the lifts, such as lifts from boxes or from the hang, either above the knee or below.  On Monday and Wednesday we also train twice, and do squats.  So Monday and Wednesday are our hardest training days.  We do one workout on Thursday, usually a bit lighter, Thursday is our easiest day.  Then Friday we do a moderate workout in the morning, and come back and max out in the afternoon.  We end the week on Saturday with our heaviest squat day, some overhead strength work, and maybe some pull technical work for some of the guys.

So, the biggest weights are normally lifted on Friday afternoon.  This Friday Jon made his biggest total ever via 163/190 as a 94kg lifter.  Travis cooper went 147/190 for a PR clean and jerk and by far his biggest total ever as an 85kg lifter . He also cleaned 193 for a PR clean.  Kaleb Whitby (105kg) went 147/185 for a training PR in the snatch, and his biggest total ever, and cleaned 193 for a PR clean.  Kevin (94kg) managed to clean and jerk 182, equaling his best competition lift.

As far as evaluating the training, i think we are about where we need to be.  There was a little fatigue, the guys did not show up for this session totally rested and ready for competition, but they were rested enough to lift weights around their best, and in a couple of cases set new PR's.

Been lifting for just over 5 years now, but I've only been competitive for just over 1 year. Sometime last year I found out about USAPL Raw Nationals and how it doesn't have a qualifiying total, all you need is *a* total in a USAPL sanctioned meet and you're in. So I did a USAPL meet in November last year where I totaled 1135@177lbs. Given my bodyweight at the time and the numbers I was putting up, I knew that I needed to cut down to the 165lb weight class in order to even be somewhat competitive. I was also carrying a little extra fat which wasn't helping my wilks out either. Since USAPL Raw Nationals isn't until July 2013, I had plenty of time so I sat around 181lbs bw for a few months and just worked on gaining strength. On February 23, 2013 I competed in a local, unsanctioned meet where I totaled 1200@176.4lbs (445/245/510, bench was not paused). For that meet I was walking around at ~181lbs and tried waterloading for the first time and got to 176.4lbs for the weigh-in.

Right after that meet in February, I began cutting weight doing a cyclical ketogenic diet (w/ intermittent fasting) with 1-2 carb load nights a week. For me, the diet has been working out fanstastic and I've been on it for 10 weeks now. In that time I have not cut back on training volume at all, and I've been able to maintain/gain some strength while on it. I've lost around 10lbs and I'm now around 171-173lbs bodyweight. It took a few weeks to get used to it but now I can work off of 2000 calories a day and still feel pretty damn good as long as I do a massive carb load every 3-5 days.

As far as training goes I train 6-7 days a week doing a Westside style routine. I train at a local barbell club (Dirty Gym, Dayton, OH) and I have a couple coaches who do a lot of the programming for me. 


**Meet Prep**

I didn't start tapering for the meet until the Tuesday before. On that Tuesday I cut back a little on the squat volume and assistance work. Wednesday I worked up to my bench opener and hit that for 10 singles, then followed it up with some upper back/lat work. Then I rested Thursday and Friday.

For this meet I had a 24 hour weigh-in and I was walking around at about 171-172lbs, so I started water loading 6 days out, drinking around 1.5-2 gallons of water a day. I also did my last carb-load on the Sunday night prior and then went keto the rest of the week until weigh-ins. 2 days out from weigh-ins I cut sodium and drank a little over a gallon of water. 1 day out I continued on very low sodium and drank about a gallon of water in the morning then cut off fluid intake at around 7pm at night. The next morning I woke up at 166lbs on my home scale, so I figured I would be good by the time I arrived at the weigh-in (40 minute drive) as long as I wore a couple hooded sweatshirts and cranked the heat in my car, *wrong*, I got there and weighed in at 165.8lbs. I then proceeded to throw on my insulated running jacket, 2 hooded sweat shirts with the hoods up, sweat pants, and gloves and then drove around in my car for another 30 minutes with the heat cranked to 90. It got so hot in my car that my phone shut off! It did the trick though and I weighed in at 164lbs afterwards!

Post weigh-in celebration consisted of 2 bottles of pedialyte, 4 donuts, 3 bananas, dried mango, beef jerky, sweet potato chips, grande mocha from starbucks, and a bunch of other shit throughout the day. Next time I think I may keep this cleaner though because I got some pretty bad indigestion in the middle of the night and some of it carried over into the meet the next day.


**The Lifts**

[Video of lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jlsr_02vtlE)

I currently don't have videos of my first 2 bench attempts, only my 3rd, still waiting on my friend to upload them.


**Squat**

**187.5kg (413.4lbs), 3 whites:** Felt a little heavy walking it out but I sunk it nice and deep and it flew up.

**200kg (440.9lbs), 3 whites:** Slight grind but it still went up without much trouble.

**205kg (451.9lbs), 3 reds:** I was fairly confident going into it that I was going to get this. I got all psyched up and yelled, but then got stuck coming out of the hole. I dive bombed it, my hips shot back, and I got stuck.


**Bench**

**107.5kg (237lbs), 3 whites:** Went up really easy, just as I had practiced on Wednesday.

**112.5kg (248lbs), 3 whites:** I got out of my groove on this one pushing it off my chest, so it went up slow, but at no point during the lift did I think I was going to fail it.

**115kg (253.5), 3 reds:** Got stuck coming off my chest, and my ass lifted off the bench to compensate as soon as that happened I knew I was done. I maybe could have got it but it would have required lifting my ass even higher off the bench to do so.


**Deadlift**

One of the side judges DID NOT like my deadlifts at all. My guess is because on the side where my grip is supinated my shoulder doesn't look like it is all the way back on the lockout.

**225kg (496lbs), 2 whites 1 red:** During the meet in February I had just missed getting a 3x bodyweight deadlift, and now since I lost weight, my opener at this meet was over 3x bodyweight and it was incredibly easy.

**232.5kg (512.6lbs), 2 whites 1 red:** Made sure to really exaggerate my lockout on this one but it still didn't please the side judge.

**237.5kg (523.6lbs), 2 whites 1 red:** Very happy with this, in February I got a [525 deadlift and hitched the fuck out of the lockout](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYD-zIEEJYg), this time it went up smooth!


**Results**

I totaled 550kg (1212.5lbs), got first place in the Raw Open 165 class, and got [this sweet medal](http://imgur.com/tc4VYaa). My wilks was 394.17, so I didn't quite get my goal of 400, but 390 wilks is my goal for Raw Nationals in July since it will qualify me to compete at the Arnolds in 2014. So now I just need *at least* a repeat performance in July.


**Final thoughts**

I thought the meet was very well run. There was only 1 platform and with over 30+ lifters we were done by 3PM or so (it started at 10AM). The judging was pretty strict on things like squat depth, but in my opinion that's a plus. It was also pretty humbling since there were some *really* strong lifters there. Matt Wenning was there competing raw and I had seen him in his ""So you think you can squat"" video series but in person that guy is HYOOOOGE.

Overall I'm really happy with my performance, I've been cutting weight for the past 2.5 months and have maintained/gained some strength. I'm going to continue to cut a couple more pounds or else it's going to be pretty hard to make weight for Raw Nationals since I have to get to 163 with only a 2 hour weigh-in. I know I need to keep working on my bench form and I want to start incorporating more paused singles to get stronger off my chest. For squats, I'm going to start experimenting with different stances. I've been using the same stance for every squat variation (front, high bar, low bar) and I want to see if I'm any stronger with a wider stance. I also want to start doing more squat variations that put an emphasis on strength out of the hole like box squats and pause squats.

Looking forward to USAPL Raw Nationals now, going to continue training hard the next couple of months, and then after that I supposed IPL Worlds in Vegas is an option now since I beat the extremely high qualifying total (992lbs).",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1367810586.0,,vpm3,True,t3_1drnjh,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1drnjh/meet_report_uspa_midwest_regionals_eaton_oh_us/,

Trigger Warning: Overly verbose weakling

A few months ago, I started espousing a two-a-day program for late beginner and early intermediate lifters. This was inspired by my attempts to design an ""overreach"" program that I could do for a month or two to really hammer my weak points (basically everything from my bellybutton up except maybe my abs). Some people asked me for a writeup when it was done, so here I am. I have far less experience than many of the regular posters here, and I've only been lifting seriously for a bit over a year (with breaks for some dislocated ribs and a hellish month-long illness). Previously, I had some lifting experience, but mostly complexes and metcons as training for martial arts.

Because my schedule was so packed, I did barbell work at the ass-crack of dawn and then some bodybuilder-style assistance at my work gym during lunch (which pretty much only has DB to 75 lbs and pullup and dip bars).

Not mentioned in the below program was my intermittent attendance of Krav Maga classes, which I would basically say count as a 15-20 metcon followed by 40-45 minutes of lower-intensity cardio. That was usually 2-3 hours a week on various days.

My recovery is generally very good, but I was also very stressed at the time I was doing this program. Despite the volume and time spent in the gym, I never had a problem recovering or overtraining, despite the fact that I was doing my heavy lifting at 4 AM. There were also a few built-in deload days because I did this program from November to January. I may have gotten a little depressed toward the end, but that could have just been my personal situation at the time.

I have a lot of shoulder issues, which I constantly bitch about on here. The pressing I was doing started giving my impingement pains, so I began alternating OHP and bench on Wednesdays. OHP was the same as above, bench replaced OHP in the morning and I did a pretty typical benchbro assistance session in the afternoon (DB bench, dips, pushups).

I also put less emphasis on Thursday. When I first started planning the program, I was still in a martial arts mindset and was worried about losing my abilities there, but as it progressed, I became less invested in my martial arts training and more invested in strength training.

I added in foam rolling, squat-to-stands, and targeted yoga as needed for mobility. And it was needed pretty frequently because I'm an office drone with a fairly high injury burden for my age.

**Results:**

Ran from Nov 2012 to Feb 2013

Weight: 189-&gt;196, some visible upper abs if you squint really hard and I'm downlit by a spotlight, didn't really change my diet

Noticeable upper back, bicep, forearm, shoulder, and quad sweep hypertrophy.

335/200/405/145. Bench is calculated from 5@170 and 2@185, the rest are tested, although the OHP may have had a bit of dip.

**Comments:**

I'm quite happy with my progress. My upper body had been a weakness for a long time, and I think this program more or less got it close to my lower body in terms of strength. My biggest form issues in bench and OHP (poor scapular control and lack of upper back tightness) are mostly gone, and deads and squat feel easier compared to how they used to, although that could just be experience and practice talking.

More importantly, I realized that overtraining is more or less bunk for newbie lifters on any standard program. I spent a lot of time lifting with relatively high volume in addition to regular HIIT work, and I still rarely if ever missed reps or had many problems despite shit sleep and lots of stress.

Was this optimal? Almost certainly not, but it worked for me at the time with my given situation. My progress on squat and dead were mediocre by my reckoning, but my OHP shot up, and surprisingly, despite only working my bench every other week for 2 months, it still exploded.

I still consider myself relatively weak and very inexperienced, but this was a fun exercise in programming, and I learned a lot about myself and my abilities. I gained a lot of intuition about what works and what doesn't work for me too, and I'm looking forward to exploring those various hunches more in the future.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_1cgmp9,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1cgmp9/experience_and_lessons_learned_with_my_twoaday/,

I was traveling and AFK all day yesterday, but that doesn't mean we can't have our thread today.

A question came up last week about hormones and lifting and it got me thinking that while the guys seem to have an unfortunate amount of broscience and hearsay about lifting, but as lady lifters, we're a lot less likely to encounter enough other women that lift in real life and therefore, we don't even have our own big enough pile of BS to wade through!

From my own experience being scared to death after missing a period after I'd been lifting 3 months and having no one good to ask about it (I went to the doctor when I was sufficiently terrified, where he informed me it was likely due to a rapid change in bodyfat that was affecting my hormones), I hope we can help each other out!

So the guiding question of the week is all about asking the (often awkward) questions about women's physiology and how it relates to lifting that you never had a big enough audience of lifting ladies to ask.

He has a few world championship gold medals and world record (at least had, I don't know if it still stands.). It is also sometimes called the Sundsvalls program from the city he lives and trains in.

http://goodlift.info/lifter.php?lid=1085

The program consists of two bench days a week and is an 8 week program. The lifts are based on your current max lift.

Day 1 will look like this:

Week 1: 8 x 8 @ 70%

Week 2: 7 x 7 @ 75%

Week 3: 6 x 6 @ 80%

Week 4: 5 x 5 @ 85%

Week 5: 4 x 4 @ 90%

Week 6: 3 x 3 @ 95%

Week 7: 2 x 2 @ 100%

Week 8: 1 x 1 @ 105%

Day 2:

Week 1-8: 8x1 90% (set x reps)
 
Day 1 should be proper lifts. If you are not used to higher volume you might need reduce the weights somewhat the first weeks and if it is too easy you should of course increase. Day 2 should be focused on explosive lifts and touch n go is perfectly alright here.

1365844407.0,61,self.weightroom,1c9fow,"[Meet Report] Australian Raw Powerlifting Championships - Melbourne, Australia - 540kg@89.16 (Junior)",zipl3r,71,10,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1c9fow/meet_report_australian_raw_powerlifting/,"The only thing anyone cares about: [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kt6fayWNXI)

**Background**

Started competing in 83kg class July 2012 as a sub junior. Competed in Oceania champs in December in 83 SJ with a 527.5kg total.  

This year I am making my way up to the 93kg class as I have a few years to get comfortable into it as a junior before I expect to be hunting records, also, being 5'10"" I think I am better suited to a heavier class than 83kg.  

I have been sick and had multiple soft tissue issues leading up to this competition, a friend of mine was going nuts with the active and passive releases of my subscap, pec minor, low trap, and pretty much  everything that has anything to do with my pressing ability.  Side note: my bench had been at 130kg since about October 2012 but had not been able to crack 132.5 UNTIL NOW.

I think the soft tissue work went very well and I'm happy to attribute my bench towards that.

My squat had changed technically since December also but still has a few issues which I am addressing but I am happy to have made a 7.5kg PR which didn't look too difficult.

But moving on...

**Training**

Leading up to the competition I wanted to use a higher frequency protocol to get used to the adjusted form for my bench and squat; I thought Skeiko would be a good idea - this thought occurred to me 2 months out.  So I jumped glute first into #31 planning to go onto #32 and be reading to smash PRs.  If you don't know about Skeiko, #31 is one of the higher volume cycles and it is strongly recommended that people run #29, the introductory cycle, before other higher volume cycles; but fuck that right?! I'm 18, I'm not some old fart that can't recover between his social tennis games.  So yes, I beat myself the fuck up - probably caused the soft tissue issues that I mentioned earlier, but on the upside, yes, I did dial in my new technical changes, the sub maximal work put in Sheiko really helped to maintain good technique while getting in a metric fuck load of volume in via ridiculous number of sets.

**Making weight**

Nothing to worry about at all, my weigh in weight was heavier than my normal walking around weight just because I was not giving a fuck about wilks and just caring about PRs on lifts and drinking BCAAs/electrolytes all morning. I probably could have made the 83kg class if I had tried to.


**Squat**

Lifts went well but looking back on the technique I can see that I need more knee travel


**Bench**

My bench work leading up to this comp and the 5 months previous had all been paused.. every. single. rep.  I think this probably gave me the power I now have off the chest but my sticking point it stickier than it should be, I have since started doing solely touch and go work, and the 2-3 training blocks I play leading up to my next comp I will pause to get back into the rhythm of it.

**Deadlift**

Felt shit, I was not feeling up to it by the time deadlifts rolled around; my flight was only 6 people so rest periods were lower than normal and for every lift I wasn't feeling excited to get to it like I have in every single other competition. 210 felt slower than it should, 225 was a grind and during the 225 my left glute med. strained a bit and so did my left QL.  I have since changed my form dramatically to a Mike Tushcherer-esque type deadlift and it feels much better and less straining on my back - I expect to see some movement in my deadlift numbers now.

**Conclusion**

**Preface**

This is my 2nd ever meet, the first being the APF/AAPF Raw Power Challenge back in December, [where I totaled 255 kg at 61.1 kg](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcF8n9LmpVI).  This meet is obviously a big improvement but largely because I sustained some minor injuries a few weeks out and had to deload quite a bit on my lifts.  Leading up to the meet, I wasn't on much of a program for deadlifts and bench but was working my squats on a lower volume version of [gzcl's protocol](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html).  I did 5 or so cycles of 5/3/1 for bench last year that brought me almost no where, and got injured just after my first attempt at smolov jr, day 1.

**""Making Weight""**

Several weeks out from the meet, I weighed anywhere between 140-143 lbs first thing in the morning.  I had every intention of lifting in the 148-lb class but decided to do a ""get rid of the water"" week for experimentation purposes, as that might come in handy as I get more competitive.  It also served the purpose of getting me under 135 lbs so I could go for a twice bodyweight squat/deadlift.  I weighed in Saturday morning a cool 7 lbs lighter at 60.7 kg, almost making the 132-lb class, which is straight-up sorcery.  Sadly rehydration became a problem, and as Rick Fowler got into the pre-meet rules briefing, I had to run to the bathroom to throw up a small fraction of the large quantities of food and pedialyte I stuffed in my face after weigh-in.  I felt better aftewards and was ready to warm up.

**Squats**

Squats are my best lift, easily.  Even though I felt good, I was nervous my pre-lifting nausea would be a problem but when I got up to my last single at 220 lbs during warm-ups, it flew up, along with my confidence.  As I locked it out I thought “no fucking problem” and had every bit of confidence with my opener of 107.5 kg = 236 lbs.

Still, nerves got me a little antsy as I approached the rack for my second attempt at 115 kg = 253 lbs, and I focused them as rage towards the bar.  Why should I feel nervous?  This is lightweight, baby.  I got mad.  It, too, went up without a problem, and I wrote 122.5 kg as my final attempt with no shortage of giddiness.  I’ve done 255 lbs singles in the gym pretty fatigued, but I was still surprised watching the film by how easy the lift appeared and felt.

Squat number three went up fairly smoothly as well, though I had to work a lot harder for it (dat knee cave).  Hearing the congratulations of the spotters, the judges, and other people throughout the meet who approached me just to congratulate me on my squat after the fact, and knowing I finally, *finally* hit my big twice bodyweight milestone, I got pretty emotional.  I decided if the rest of the meet ended up totally fucked, I would still walk out happy.  The meet director exclaimed I had the best squat in my weight class over the loud speakers, beating out total tanks who would go on to destroy me in the bench and deadlift.  That was a very proud moment for me, and it took a while for the smile to come off my face.

**Bench**

Back in October and November, my shoulder started giving me some problems that prevented me from benching for a while.  Once I began benching again, I noticed a significant decrease in strength, but I had a really nice moment the week before the meet where I had no trouble with a 105 lb paused single in the gym.  I knew I could hit that in the meet, and I went for it on my second attempt (47.5 kg).  My third attempt gave me some nerves, as my pre-injury PR was 120 lbs, and I was facing 52.5 kg = 115.7 lbs, just slightly less than how I lifted full-strength.  I’ve never lifted this much with a pause, and I haven’t gone this high since my shoulder’s issues came to light… but I pushed it up.

**Deadlifts**

I don’t really know how to describe to you how deadlifts make me feel.  Before a squat, I can feel the weight on my back.  My body has control of it already: it’s sitting there, waiting to be moved.  Same with a bench.  The weight sits in my outstretched arms, pushing my shoulders down as my legs push my weight onto my traps.  I can sense how heavy it is before the lift begins.  Perhaps this is the origin of my fear of deadlifts.  The weight sits there, laughing at me, and I have no idea how it will feel.  Sometimes in a squat, 225 lbs feels heavy on my back.  How heavy will this bar feel in my hands?  *cough HTFU cough*.

My opener was alright, but my second attempt (same as my squat attempt, at 115 kg) felt quite heavy.  I had to psych myself into the lift, pacing around the gym with music blasting in my ears.  I got the weight up but it was no easy feat.  Wanting it badly enough, and thinking I could pump myself enough for it, I put 122.5 kg down as my third attempt.  I wanted to walk out of the meet saying I can squat and deadlift twice my bodyweight.  My brain, my strength, and my fatigue battled each other, and I got the weight up a few inches before realizing it wasn’t going anywhere else but back on the floor.

**Trouble Spots**

I need to work on getting my mind right for deadlifts.  My form work, of course, is a never-ending story (and I invite you, /r/weightroom, to give me any comments you think that might help).  But the most important factor: **I have to put in the fucking work.**  Guess what I do on squat day?  I go apeshit, putting all of myself and my strength into the lifts to make them as strong and successful as possible.  I don't do a million variations, I just fucking squat, and I get stronger… surprise, surprise.  What do I do on deadlift day?  I get scared.  I need to train them and train them as hard as I squat.  The program I’m on doesn’t even fucking matter.

All in all, I came in 3rd of out 8 females in my weight class, and still got a little medal for my place.  I got to watch Matt and smoftie kick some serious ass, meet loads of other awesome lifters, and see a dude squat 900 lbs.  Pretty awesome.  End wall of text.

**My problem**: I believe that my strength is outperforming my CNS.  

Yesterday, I pulled 385lbs (at 175lb BW) and it came up easily and I had some speed on the bar.  I could have done another rep or two, had I not felt like I would pass out in the process.  I felt very lightheaded and decided it would be best to break for a minute before doing another rep.  This is the second consecutive time that this has happened to me.

I recently began training 3x per week again, after a few months of only training 1-2x per week (I got complacent).  Does it take longer for your CNS to return to prior levels than your muscles do after a period of ""detraining""?  Could it be related to diet?

Thanks all.

**Video**

[Some good, some bad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI-HUpwa9dA)

**Training**

I decided to do this meet 13 weeks ago because it was only an hour from my house and it's the meet I did last year. My last two meets *(July and Aug 2011)*, I've totaled 480kgs each time with different results in the lifts. I set a goal of 580kgs based on where my squat was, and what I though I could increase to on bench and deadlift.

Step 1: Grow a beard - nuff said.

Step 2: I knew I would get the most bang for buck on the deadlift since it was equal to my squat and ready to explode, so I would focus on the weaknesses there most. 

Nods to triplewithcheese, troublesome, ecnosihtgnisu *(uto)*, and shortkid for affecting how I would change my training. troublesome commented 6 months ago that I needed more explosiveness so I started to incorporate that and speed work. UTO mentioned first, then shortkid, to try out Sumo deads to help bring up my conventional dead.

Triplewithcheese has Svunted, but he was always helpful with advice on our IRC chats...

I'm old and recover slowly, I have very limited time and inconsistent schedule to train so I went back to my roots of basically doing upper body one day and lower the next with a mix of heavy and speed to help me recover and repeat with no planned days off as they would come anyway due to life.  I focused on 4 lifts only and their variations: Squat, Bench, Dead and Row with the schedule looking like the following *(each line is one day)*:

* Heavy Paused Bench and heavy Pendlay Rows
* Heavy Squats
* Speed or Deadstop Bench superset with KB rows and rotating bench grips through wide, medium and narrow.
* Deadlift variations *(Sumo, SLDL, Paused)*
* Heavy Paused Bench and heavy Pendlay Rows
* Paused or Anderson squats
* Speed or Deadstop Bench superset with KB rows and rotating bench grips through wide, medium and narrow.
* Heavy Deadlifts or Rack pulls
* Repeat

For heavy days, basically followed the 1-Drop method of working up to some really heavy reps of 1,2,3 and then repping out 1-2 sets at 80-90%, trying to increase with the overall trend.

It worked pretty well as I could tell I was gaining in bench and deadlift, but squat was hard to tell if I was gaining. The Sumo really helped, but I stubbed my toe and couldn't Sumo for a month right in the middle, so that sucked. I was able to get a 400lb single in my last session when I could barely get 315lbs when I first tried them. I'll be looking forward to using it more.

Additionally, working everyday I got pretty tired and beat up by the end of this but I liked how it all came out up to a week before.

**The Lead Up**

Nursing several muscle strains, I took 8 days off except for a light bench day working up to opener on Tues. I went to bed at 9:30 - 10pm every night and took half a sleeping pill from Tues - Fri. 

I didn't care much about weight as I was floating around 230-235lbs for the entire 3 months and I was not going to cut for this. Also, I was feeling a slight cold coming on, so I fed myself to make sure it didn't become a full cold.

Saturday night I went to bed early again but with no sleeping pill. Woke up refreshed and feeling good. Weighed 106.1kgs on my scale, knew I was 4kgs under and decided a couple pounds wouldn't hurt my Wilks much, so I drank 2 scoops of ON, 2 raw eggs, creatine and water with some espresso on the side.  I knew this would also clear me out so I didn't have to worry about a BM later. I also had half a jar of PB.

Got my stuff on and drove over to the meet. Weighed in at 106.5kgs a few hours later, verified I could use my slippers in all three events, and was all set.

**Squats**

The warmup area had 2 racks and 3 platforms. I saw some familiar faces from last year and we all started warming up together. I brought my 20kg KB to help me warmup up with Goblet Squats and Halos for the shoulders.

*Warmups*

* 135 x 3 - HB paused; ATG
* 225 x 3 - HB ATG
* 273 x 3 - LB
* 315 x 1 - LB
* 365 x 1 - LB

Also, *Holy shit...that guy over there is WARMING UP with lmao5plate*

*Platform* - PRs in bold

* 182.5kgs/402lbs [][][] - Phew. Nerves fading. I had been worried about depth because I was inconsistent in training but being fresh made it easy to hit. Also, I used all my first attempts as my last warmup. It's something I know I'll hit and saves me energy.
* **202.5kgs/446lbs** [][][] - Went for the small PR over my gym PR and was a slow one but got it.
* **205kgs/452lbs** [][][] - Guy tried to convince me to go for 5kg jump, but based on second being so hard, I opted for the minimum. Got under it, un-racked and, ""WTF!?"" Immediately unbalanced and I thought I had really missed the mark. Re-racked and they misloaded the bar! Goddammit. I feel it's times like these that it's helpful I'm not one of those super psyched up lifters. It didn't affect my focus much, but still annoying. I got the lift and as I walked off the platform I slapped the guy at the table on the shoulder, ""I probably *did* have 5 more lbs in me..."" and we chuckled together...full homo.

**Bench**

There were two flights so there would be no delay between lifts and only 9 lifters in the second flight, so bench warmups had to be a little quick. No biggie for me, mine were short.

*Warmups*

* 45 x 5 - paused
* 135 x 3 - paused
* 185 x 3 - no pause
* 225 x 1 - paused
* 245 x 1 - paused; this flew up and I felt really good.

*Platform*

* 125kgs/275lbs [][][] - Guy made me really steady the bar before 'Start'; pause was normal; went up easy, but not like I had expected it to feel. Thought about calling for 137.5kgs but went for my goal of 140kgs...
* 140kgs/308lbs [x][x][x] - Wah, wah, waaaaah. Eccentric felt great. No tightness in shoulders. Just could not push it up. I debated even trying the third attempt to save energy because I knew probably wouldn't get it. I have never hit a missed bench after failing it once like squat or dead...
* 140kgs/308lbs [x][x][x] - Not even close, but I don't think it hurt me too much energy wise.

**Deadlifts**

Starting to feel more mental fatigue at this point than actual fatigue and I really had to catch myself from become blase about the rest of the meet. I had made 32oz of super concentrated coffee the day before and had about 16oz left so I chugged it. I would warmup mostly my CNS here:

*Warmups*

* 135 x 3 - setting movement
* 315 x 1 - waited about 7-8 mins before doing this
* 385 x 1 - same, also about 7-8 mins before 1st attempt

*Platform*

* 200kgs/441lbs [][][] - Easy peasy.
* **220kgs/485lbs** [][][] - Based on my bench fiasco, went for the 10lb PR here instead of 500lbs for my goal. It went up really smooth but I felt a small twinge in my left hamstring that wore off by the third.
* 227.5kgs/501lbs [x][x][x] - Came off the floor easy but died at the knees. I think my mental fatigue did also hurt my physical fatigue here. Looking back I didn't rip it off the floor hard enough to help me through transition; I just kind of pulled it up. It didn't feel OMG heavy, just wouldn't come up. I think I could have gotten it had I tried for the 2nd.

**Total**

So I went 6/9 and 550kgs/1212lb is 70kgs/154lbs more than last year so I'm happy about that. I wanted to get 210kgs/462lbs for squat and with a little in the tank on 3rd I feel good that I was close to that. If I hadn't messed up bench I may have had the confidence to go for 501 on the 2nd DL. Overall I think I left 12.5kg and 7.5kg on the platform with bench and dead,respectively. However, I got 2 lift PRs and I feel good about my overall strength even if I didn't hit my absolute max total for the day.

*Lessons Learned*

* The thought of coffee still makes me want to vomit. Too much caffeine too. I was nauseous and had a headache most of the evening and didn't sleep well. Will look for a better intra-meet stim next time.
* WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO YOUR PAST LESSONS FOR BENCH! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Go for the meet PR based on how you feel, then try to bench goal on third. I would have 95% surely gotten 303lbs and I left 12.5kgs/28lbs on the table.
* It's pretty nice to have official totals in squats and deadlift since I'm pretty sure my cheapo weights in the basement are not exactly what the weight they say they are.
* I feel my bench training was good even though I choked here. I pressed 315lbs puased recently after doing a PR session with Pendlays right before. That's about a 20lbs increase since 12 weeks ago.
* I gained about 50lbs on my deadlift in 12 weeks. Great success.
* I think the biggest factor is doing all three in one day for the first time since April made it tougher and cost me a few lbs.
* Now I'll try to lose 25lbs and maintain strength. I want to compete in 93kgs/205lbs IPF class next year.
* Fully half the flight was older than me and stronger so that's encouraging *(I'm 40 for those who don't know)*

Next meet will probably be Raw Nationals in Orlando next July and I'm looking forward to gaining another 70kgs at least...",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1344981986.0,,,True,t3_y7h24,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/y7h24/meet_report_usapl_nj_states_550kgs1212lbs_total/,

* Recently learned for the traditional DL, if you have big quads choose a shoulder stance but stand further back from the bar.

* RDL have taught me that all DL's are a pushing movement that occur with your heels digging into the ground. Rip teaches hip drive in the squat by teaching his students to raise there ass first til they feel his hand, its the same thing or at least that's how i picture it

* If you are losing tightness at the bottom of your squat try one of two things first, widen your stance some and actively pull yourself inwards with your hip flexors

* When your at the bottom of a squat, instead of just pushing straight up actively push your knees out this will engage your hips

New account, this is my flair post. I currently weigh 188 - 190 and have been training for strength for a bunch of years. Here are my big-3 lifts:

[squat, 565, wraps](http://youtu.be/JChx4mfqcgk)


[bench, 315](http://youtu.be/ND97XrTSkUk)


[dead, 605](http://youtu.be/dYq-YKwVR1A)


I train 4 days per week, with one main lift each day in this order: squat, bench, dead, press. I follow a general template for each day, something like:

* PVC/LAX roll, warm up exercises

* Main lift, work up to heavy single, triple or double

* Big accessory lift, generally 10 reps but occasionally lower (not often though)

* Small accessory lifts, if time and energy permit (i.e. isolation stuff: curls, extensions, flyes)

* Band traction or static stretching

I generally vary the main lift from week to week. Squatting for example would be to-a-box with reverse bands, to-a-box with chains, and free. Deadlift for example would be RDL-on-box and sumo DL. 

Current challenges include managing recovery (especially back recovery), and fast-tracking bench progress now that my shoulder is in serviceable condition. Also, as a desk jockey, keeping my hip flexors and glutes in line is a constant concern.

I do keep a training log on T-nation and recognize a few r/weightroom posters from that forum. So hello!

I'm curious how your thinking changed, or if there was just something you thought became particularly essential at that later stage in your training!


____________________


I should probably give my own input - I'm sitting at a 345 paused bench, a 405 squat, and 475 deadlift.  I'd just moved up 5-10 lbs. per week up to 270x5 bench, 335x3 squat, and 365x5 deadlift, at which point I ran a 12-week linear progression meet-peaking program that put me at my current PR's.  Doing some recovery work for the next couple weeks then thinking about doing another 12-week training cycle to hit some new higher numbers.

I feel doing deadlift assistance work has really helped me break through on the lift for once, and I'm looking to expand on that by hammering and perfecting Romanian Deadlifts/increase my rowing strength.  Bench seems to respond well to hammering it from a bottom-end perspective one session (paused bench, dead bench) and top-end work the other day (full-range CGBP, perhaps banded, and overhead presses as of now).  Squats I'm still figuring out, seems whatever I do it increases at roughly the same pace... wondering if speed work's worth anything.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1345306557.0,,,True,t3_yfk2d,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/yfk2d/what_brought_your_lifts_from_300400_400500_or/,

I somehow manage to fall in the middle, because I just fucking love doing shrugs (what else am I gonna move 6 plates on?), but I have never really noticed carryover per se. They also, like I said, absolutely wreck the entire back side of my upper body.

This is my first post in weightroom. I'm a long time lurker and love seeing the discussions on here between knowledgable, experienced lifters.

I'm a powerlifter with a couple of years under my belt, and have my first meet (100% RAW federation, full power in Zions Crossroad, VA)  in September. I'm 5'9, 170-175 pounds, and will be competing in the 165 pound class. My best lifts are a 365 squat, a 215 bench, and a 505 deadlift.

During one of my school breaks, I was fortunate enough to be able to run a six day program influenced by an article on the Dezso Ban blog regarding strength training without PEDs. Despite numerous wild-eyed assertions by my peers that I'd be ""overtraining"" and ""laid up on my couch inside of two weeks"", I flourished both in terms of my physique and in terms of strength. My shoulders and traps bulked up and I felt awesome.

However, reality struck, and when I found myself back at school under a heavy course load, I dropped my training back to four days a week and adopted the cube method. I love Brandon Lilly and I love his programming.

Now it is summer, and I've been contracted to work abroad for a month in a city where I know absolutely nobody and will have four weeks to test the absolute limits of my human potential. I'm willing to do whatever it takes, and will have absolute control of my diet and training. As this is a place I've been before, I know of a good gym in the area that will serve my needs.

Diet wise, I need to stay in the low 170s to high 160s to make my water cut to 165 decently comfortable. I will be on Jamie Lewis' APD because I've found it works well for me in the past and is incredibly awesome. I will have complete control over diet and supplementation.

Does anyone here on R/weightroom have any experience with a Bulgarian style, 6 day a week program?

This is my first post to weightroom and reddit! I find it really helpful when other women and/or beginner lifters post meet reports so I thought I’d post my own now that I have a meet under my belt. Hopefully I'm doing this right!

tl;dr: first meet went well, f'ed up what would have been a sweet DL, video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gR6sYWndDE&amp;feature=youtu.be). 

**Background and Training**

5'4"", 23 years old, 125ish lbs. I have ZERO athletic background. I learned to squat and deadlift from my boyfriend (an oly lifter) in Fall 2011. I started focusing on powerlifting specifically (and learned bench) in Aug 2012--my lifts were at 140/45/185. I programmed myself from Aug-Jan, switching between volume days (5x3) and heavy PR days. I really had no idea what I was doing but it worked for me for a while. I started Madcow in mid-January after my lifts stalled at 185/105/225 for a couple months. I had difficulty with the weekly progression in everything but the squat. Bench stalled out early and often, deadlift stalled out once after about week 7. Overall I’d say the program was good for my squat and DL, meh for bench. PRs going into the meet were 200/110/240. 

I train in my university gym and the internet is my coach. I frequent /r/weightroom, fitocracy, and some blogs by female lifters. I’d say /r/weightroom has been my best resource so far. My boyfriend helps me with form—you’ll see the oly influence in my lifts when you watch my meet video.

**Meet Prep**

I chose this meet so that I could train while I studied for Step 1 of my boards (took the exam April 24th). This was possibly the best idea ever—having strictly scheduled, focused workouts and a big meet to look forward to really helped me keep my sanity while I was studying. 

I ran Madcow up until the Saturday before the meet. Monday before the meet I hit my openers to soothe my nerves (don’t think I could have hit them on Saturday if I hadn’t done this) and the Wednesday before I did singles of all 3 lifts at 70%.  I did sort of cut weight for the meet. I wanted to chance to easily go to nationals or IPL worlds if I so desired. I’m normally around 125, so all I had to do was cut carbs the week before to get rid of my glycogen stores. I fasted the day of as well—nothing but creatine, BCAAs, and a little water (I normally do IF with a 10 hr eating window so this wasn’t a huge deal). I overshot the weight loss and ended up weighing in at 120.8, then ate a ridiculous amount after weigh in, rehydrated, went to bed, and barely slept due to nerves (oh well). Morning of the meet my intestines were, uh, not well. Let’s just say I lost a lot of water volume that morning.

**The Lifts**
I went 92.5 kg/50 kg/110 kg. Video [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gR6sYWndDE&amp;feature=youtu.be). 

SQUAT: 
First attempt—87.5 kg. Make. My legs were shaking and it was harder than it should have been.
Second attempt—92.5 kg. Make. Small 3.5 lb PR. Definitely felt like a PR squat. 
Third attempt—95 kg. No lift. Picked a small increase in weight because of how slow 92.5 kg was. On the way down I thought “oh, I probably won’t make this,” and immediately lost all confidence/form.  Lesson learned: there’s no room for doubt up on the platform. 

BENCH PRESS: 
First attempt—45 kg. Make. Could have repped out 5 of these.
Second attempt—47.5 kg. Make. Still too easy.
Third attempt—50 kg. Make. My breathing got thrown off and the lift was harder than it should have been. This was a weight I’ve pressed in the gym before. It was important to me to get all 3 lifts on bench because it’s my weakest lift and I REALLY wanted all the experience I could get benching under meet conditions. 

DEADLIFT:
First attempt—105 kg. Make. Easy.
Second attempt—110 kg. Make. Easy but slower. Since I weighed in at 120.8 this was my first 2x bodyweight deadlift! It also put me over 300 wilks, my goal for the competition.
Third attempt: 115 kg. No lift—took it to lockout but didn’t do a controlled drop or wait for a command. With the exception of the f' up re: commands this was the best lift of my life. One of those that I would have given up on if I hadn't had a crowd cheering me on. I fought it all the way up, locked it out like a boss, threw my hands in the air to celebrate….and realized I had dropped the bar entirely. **AUGHHH**. I was terribly embarrassed and not thinking straight and my first instinct was to swear then cry. Not a proud moment, but everyone at the meet was so wonderfully nice to me about it—at this point I honestly just feel bad for reacting so negatively about what truly was an awesome pull. 

**Results**

Total 555.5 lbs at 120.8 lbs for a 301.584 Wilks. Woo! I won my weight class by virtue of being the only one in my weight class, lol. I was also the only woman in Raw Open. I knew going in that it wouldn’t be a competition, and I’m thrilled to have met my goals of 300 Wilks and 2x bw deadlift!

**Thoughts/Future Directions**

Overall a good meet, slightly soured by my embarrassment over dropping that last deadlift. I can follow commands just fine until I really put effort into a lift. Then it’s brain fart central. I need to start incorporating commands into every PR attempt so that it becomes natural.  Also I feel silly about trying to cut weight. Definitely wasn’t necessary and I may have been stronger had I not messed with my eating the week before.

The other lifters at the meet were AMAZING. People really gave it their all and were so, so nice. There were some real characters up on the platform that made for an entertaining meet. I was surprised at the range of people too...I think ages ranged from 21 to 70 and weights from 120 (yours truly) to 300+. It was cool to see a broad range of weight lifted up there, including raw and single ply lifts.

As far as the next few months go for me, I’m switching focus back to the Oly lifts now that I’m stronger and my proprioception has improved. I hope to go to a weightlifting meet in early August. I expect that my squat and deadlift will improve with an oly program, but I’ll need to keep working on bench independently. I’m open to suggestions in this regard.

Regarding future PL meets: As I mentioned before I’m a med student. From Sept-Oct I’m doing a surgery rotation so I’ll no longer have weekends free for meets. I will however have a home gym with a squat rack and DL platform (moving in June!). I’m hoping to use what little free time I have then to at least maintain my strength and go to another PL meet in Nov/Dec during my Neuro/Psych rotation.

Thanks for reading my long-winded meet report. I'd love any feedback--I mostly posted this in the hopes of getting thoughts from more experienced lifters, and maybe inspiring some other beginners to get out there and do a real meet!

**TLDR:**  
A.S.Prilepin, a Russian sports scientist, collected and analyzed over 1,000 training logs of elite lifters, and derived a system that tells you how many reps and sets to do at a specific intensity level (% of your 1RM) to have optimal strength adaption.

Some other guy came along and created a formula that allows you to calculate the ""work level"" of a whole workout, even if you perform a combination of different intensities.

Using his formula, you can create a program with differing % 1RM, reps, and sets, but still be able to compare them to one another so you can create ramping progression without it just being a boring linear increase in only one of the 3 variables. This is the basis of most of the percentage-based periodization programs you see, including 5/3/1, sheiko, and westside.

The good part of the PDF is the *INOL of a set formula* on the second to last page, and the *INOL guidlines* on the last page.

**Weight** - before/after - 173 - didn't change - I only ate about 300 cals more than I previously had on my lifting days.

I currently follow 4 day split 5/3/1 BBB programming.  It has been working great but up until February 16, but I felt my bench had been stalling.  On my last cycle I could only peak at 245x3.  The previous cycle to that was 240x4.  So I decided to run Smolov Jr for bench congruently with my next 5/3/1 cycle beginning February 18th.  

I only cut back (3x8 deadlifts, 3x10 squats) on the BBB for deadlifts and squats, and left it out completely for OHP.  I also completely cut out dips.  I did increase more pendlay rows into the mix as well.  I did those on Mondays and Fridays.  I also still followe the 5/3/1 for OHP.

Week 1 weight; **Monday** 192.5x6x6, **Wednesday** 207.5x7x5, **Friday** 220x8x4, **Saturday** 232.5x10x3.  

I increased this by ten pounds the second week, and 7.5 pounds the third week.

Week 3 weight; **Monday** 210x6x6, **Wednesday** 225x7x5, **Friday** 237.5x8x4, **Saturday** 250x10x3. Completed the 10x3 On March 16.

I decided to go for a rep max not a 1 rep max, because my goal is to get stronger not really show off a 1RM.  Today was bench day for week 3 of my latest 5/3/1 cycle, I completed [250x7](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwIYjOqreGs)(I was thought I had 8, I was wrong).  A few other lifts went up as well.  My OHP last cycle peaked at 190x4, this last Wednesday I peaked at 192.5x5(I was not expecting this, I wish I would have taken video!).  My weighted dips also went up 5 pounds.  I was doing 3x10 with 15 pounds hanging.  Yesterday I did 3x10 with 20 pounds hanging and was able to complete the movements with gas in the tank.  

**Conclusion**

The program worked for me.  And not just for my bench but also for a few other upper body compound lifts.  I learned that I have the ability to add more volume into my 5/3/1 routine, and still get stronger.  Which I will be doing going forward.  I really liked benching four days a week and had perma-pump in my chest for three weeks.  I had no shoulder pains throughout the program.  I only felt arm fatigue on the 10x3 days.  I did have wrist pains, so I used my wrist wraps and that took care of the pain.  Looking forward, I am excited to start running Smolov Jr. for my squat in a few weeks/month.

A little background- I do have a ridiculously overpowered upper back (shrugging is my natural habitat), and I have a possible piriformis injury (basically glute pain that occasionally radiates to my ankle). I also have always sucked at deadlifting conventionally and sumo- the only time I've ever pulled more than I squatted was in competition.

So today, after squatting I decided to do snatch grip deadlifts on a whim, and they were amazing. I felt super stable, and I wasn't exhausted even after doing 10 singles @ 365 with little rest between them. I probably could have done 20 singles but I just didn't have the time.

I don't think I'm stronger in snatch grip that conventional (though if I could get mixed grip on snatch maybe, hahaha), but I was wondering if anyone else had any ideas about this?

Also, just generally ask questions about SGDL. It's awesome for the upper back by the way- I already feel it more than in a conventional deadlift.

Also I'm done with finals, so I feel like I have all the free time in the world.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_14ulow,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/14ulow/snatch_grip_deadlifts/,

thoughts about the meet :

Should have picked my numbers better, I know that I suck benching with a pause so I should have known better then jumping straight to 125 kg from 115, 120 would have definitely gone up.. but what ever it's easy to be wise afterwards.
Maybe I left to much in the tank in squat, could have done maybe 5-10 kg more but I wanted to have something left for the deadlift, which sucked for me today so I am pissed about letting a good day for squatting not lead to a PR.
In the deadlift there was nothing to blame but myself, should have pulled harder at the last one even though my lower back was pretty tight.

In the end it was a Meet PR in squat, bench, deadlift and total though so I can't complain even though everything did not go as planned. Not surprising though that I got PR's in everything, been well over a year since I competed. But I cant be all too happy about a meet where I only get 4 lifts out of 9.

here is a video of my best lifts, as you can see the bench and deadlift were not that heavy for me, should have picked my numbers better in the next lifts afterwards :

It is something that has always looked bad ass but that I have never had the opportunity to do. Thursday night, opportunity knocked and I found out there was a strongman contest about an hour from my house on Saturday.

**Meet Prep**

I had a full PL meet last weekend, and had taken this week off, so prep and training for this consisted of 2 days of watching as many videos on technique as I could.

**Day of the meet:**

I'm going to say right now that every single time I show up to a strength sport meet I am blown away by how supportive and friendly everyone is. I walked up, never having touched a strongman implement in my life and just wondered around. I approached a group of guys who looked big and were helping setup and asked if they had done this before, they said no. One guy came up, introduced himself and asked if I was competing, I said I was thinking about it, and asked if he was. He said no, he was just helping organize. I asked if he had done it before, he said yea a few time...turns out he has won the Hawaii Strong Man competition for the heavyweights. So ""yea a few times"" is about as humble as it gets. I asked if he thought I should do it, and he said ""just entering is a win. It takes a lot to come out and do this stuff"". I cut a check, signed a form and was in. 

I continued to walk around for about an hour looking at the devices, and just hanging out as I got there really early. The promoter came up and asked if I had done any of the stuff before, and I said no. He told me to come with him and gave me a quick less on how to pick up atlas stones and a couple of his guys worked with me a bit. All of them just taking time out of there day to show me, some random guy who showed up out of no where, to help me out. I really appreciated it.

We all met up for the event meetings, and at first only 2 of the guys in my class showed up (me and one other). The other guy was a nationally ranked strongman and national record holding powerlifter. He asked how long I had been doing this, and I told him it was my first time he smiled and said he was just going to make this a training day and he would do all the stuff with me and we could just help each other out and have fun. Though out the day he gave me advice on all the events, showed me how to do some of them during warm-ups, etc. Right before the start, a couple other guys I knew from the PL scene showed up and were competing and they were helping me out too.

This is without a doubt what I love most about powerlifting and strongman. The community of people that do it are a family. At no point have I ever felt looked down on when competing in an event where I was just going to get demolished. 


The day was broken up into 5 events.

**Event 1: Truck Pull** 2nd place

This was funny. When it was time to pull a truck, I saw a semi and was like ""shit, we have to pull that?"" the event coordinator laughed, said that was for the teenagers and I was pulling a cargo truck with trailer. Weight was 33,000lbs.

This event was actually much easier than I had thought, we harnessed in, and pulled the truck 100ft. I did it in just under 23 seconds. The other guy in my weight class did it at right around 22. He said the harnesses were setup higer than usual, which made this harder than usual (and made using the rope you can pull to help you harder, so both he and I ended up just dropping the rope and trotting with the thing.)

**Farmers Walk** - 2nd place

The 3rd competitor showed up in our weight class for this event, so we all setup. 230lbs/per hand. The course was 100 ft, turn at the end 100ft back. I made it to the end, then lost control through the turn, set back up and made it about 3/4 of the way back before the time limit was hit. The pro killed it, the 3rd guy made it only to the turn I believe.

**Log Press** - Tied for last place

My shoulder has been acting up so I was planning on skipping this entirely (I didnt even know it was going to be there). But when it came time, I wanted to give it a shot. I was able to do a few warmups with the log, but couldnt make the competition weight (235lbs) for a single rep. I didn't want to aggravate my shoulder so I didn't push it too hard. I was told I made the right decision as sometimes you just need to save yourself for other events. The 3rd guy made 0 reps so we were even and the pro added some weight and did a few reps an exhibition. His coach grabbed me when he was lifting and was explaining the mistakes I made when trying, how to do it better in the future what the queues people were saying meant, etc.  It was great.

** Medley** - 2nd place

The medley was as follows:

* Keg Carry - 160lbs keg 60 feet.
* Sled pull - use a 100lb chain to pull a 240lb sled (340lb total) 60 feet
* Run back to the sleds (60 feet)
* Sled Pull - regular sled with a v-bar handle - 250lbs for 100ft

**Yoke Walk** - 2nd place.

Good god. This was hard. Weight on the yoke was 535lbs, which isnt much when you look at the pros who rock 1000lbs at times. But it is crushing.

course was 60 feet, and I swear every time Id exhale I felt like the weight would just come crushing down on me. I had to set the thing down 3 times to reset and go. 

**Loading Event** - 2nd place

This was another medley of sorts.

* **Put 160lb keg up on a 4ft high platform **- I did this with ease.
* **Lift 235lb atlas stone over a 5 foot bar** - lol no chance. I was able to break the stone from the ground, but I couldnt get a solid grip on it and I couldnt get the tacky to stick to my arms as I was just drenched in sweat and it was raining. Moving these stones is very hard. My arms are marked to hell from the stone ripping up my forearms.
* **Lift a 250lbs atlast stone over a 5 foot bar** - didnt do as I couldn't get passed the first stone.
* **Throw a 100lb chain onto a 6' platform** - didn't do because of the other stones.

The pro dominated this. He ended up moving 4 stones, 2 kegs and 2 100lb chains onto a higher platform for lolz. Awesome to watch.

**So would I do it again?**

Hands down, 100% yes. Absolutely. I had an amazing time. Strongman uses strength in a whole new way. It is fantastic. The promoter has a small group who trains together and they want more people as they are going to be doing a once a month workshop on strongman at their gym, so I gave him my number and told him I would be there if he would tell me where and when it was. 



There is another strongman even in august (I also have a full PL meet in august I think) so I am going to be busy.

I strongly suggest everyone try this at least once. It was an AMAZING time. I don't regret doing this for a second and would do it again in a heart beat.

Thanks to /u/edubation and /u/threewhilelights for the advice at the last minute. You guys are awesome. And thanks to everyone here and in FCJ, you guys always got my back when I try stupid things, and I appreciate that, even if you all are just internet people.

Time to re-write my program to include strongman training stuff. 

I'm waiting for a friend to upload pics and I will post some (he came out and took pics for me).

1374552986.0,56,self.weightroom,1iv3us,"[Meet Report] USAPL Raw Nationals - Orlando, FL - 1201 @ 166.1lbs | 386.5 Wilks",desolati0n,69,13,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1iv3us/meet_report_usapl_raw_nationals_orlando_fl_1201/,"**Background and Training**

So I've been planning on going to this meet for almost a year now after I heard it mentioned on here. At first my only goal was to go to it because I thought it would be awesome to go to a large meet to compete along side of a lot of really strong lifters, but as it got closer and closer to Raw Nationals, my goals and expectations of myself grew much larger. I had added quite a bit to my lifts and now I wanted to at least qualify for the 2014 Arnold's and possibly get a 400 wilks. It wasn't until about 4 weeks before the meet that I found out that they had upped the 2014 Arnold qualifier from 390 to 400 wilks, which put even more pressure on me. I did a USPA meet in May where I totaled 1212.5@164 which gave me a 394 wilks, so in order to get that 400 I needed to hit some nice PRs on everything.

I was originally planning on competing in the 74kg/163lb weight class, but once I found out that they increased the Arnold qualifier, I decided against it and instead just competed in the next higher weight class in hopes of getting a 400 wilks. I'm a bit too heavy for 163 (I walk around at 170-172lbs) and I have to cut too much water weight to really recover in time with a 2 hour weigh-in.

A few weeks out from the meet I started practicing my form again for the competition lifts. I have been mainly high bar/safety bar squatting due to my horrible flexibility giving me bicep issues when low bar squatting, so I needed to start practicing it again to get comfortable with it. I did find that streching my chest/shoulders out really good with a band before squatting would improve my flexibility enough that I could low bar squat without issue. At my last meet I had the problem of dive-bombing in the hole and dropping waaaay too far below parallel for a low-bar squat; I was pretty much treating it like an ass-to-grass high bar squat. So in order to fix that I started leaning forward slightly more and did a slower ascent, and it feels *much* better. I've always had issues with bench press too, but I recently found out that I haven't been squeezing my glutes while benching which has been causing me to have horrible leg drive and I lose my arch as soon as the weight starts getting heavy. I also found out that I feel much more comfortable benching with a fairly wide-grip (index fingers on the rings) and decided to use this grip for competition.


**Meet Prep**

I started tapering a week out and mainly just worked on hitting my openers. 5 days out I worked up to my opening squat, and 3 days out I worked up to my bench opener. Other than that I pretty much rested and took it easy the last week.

The Saturday/Sunday before the meet I did a fairly big carb load to make sure that I was competely full, and then went low carb until the weigh-in. I also began waterloading 6 days out from the weigh-in, drinking about 2 gallons of water a day. The day before the weigh-in I went low sodium and then I cut water intake around 16 hours out from the weigh-in.

The whole weigh-in process was hectic and incredibly stressful. I originally sent in my registration form months ago and I registered for the 163lb weight class, so in order to bump up to the next one, I sent the meet directory a message on Facebook a week or two before the meet asking if he could bump me up and he said yes. I guess I also misunderstood the rule where you're supposed to show up 10 minutes before the weigh-in of the class you want to compete in, so instead of showing up 10 minutes before the weigh-in of the 163 class on Friday morning, I showed up about 15-20 minutes before the weigh-in of the 182 class on Saturday morning. The officials at weigh-in/equipment check gave me some crap for it, and I was freaking out worrying that they weren't going to let me lift, but they finally penciled me in. I was also a bit lucky because they weighed-in the people who were penciled in first, so I ended up being the 2nd person to weigh-in which gave me the full 2 hours to rehydrate. I also should mention that the 182 class was MASSIVE. It had 3 flights by itself and they had to delay the start time by a half hour because they couldn't even finish the weigh-ins in the allotted time.

After weigh-in I drank 2 bottles of pedialyte, drank 100g of Glycofuse, and ate some beef jerky and a bunch of snicker bars and reese cups. I also snacked on bananas, Gatoraid, Fruity Pebbles, and dried mango throughout the meet. Even though I only waterloaded down to 166lbs and didn't forcibly sweat out any extra water, I still found myself cramping up during the meet; further reinforcing that I'm too heavy to even attempt making the 163lb weight class (w/ a 2 hour weigh-in), unless I want to feel like complete and utter shit while lifting.


**The Lifts**

[Video of lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PegXpCSWxnE)


**Squat**

Warmups felt amazing for squats, everything was quick and felt really strong. I also tried something new; after warming up to 386x1, I then overwarmed on just the unrack/walkout by throwing 451.7lbs on the bar. It felt heavy as hell, but it made my opening attempt feel much better.

**187.5kg (413.2lbs), 3 whites**

**200kg (440.7lbs), 3 whites:** Went up a little slow but it was definitely better than the one I did at my last meet.

**205kg (451.7lbs), 3 whites:** Now this was a grinder! It felt incredible to get this squat though and it really set my mood up for bench.


**Bench**

I guessed my rack heights at the weigh-in instead of running halfway across the hotel to get them, so I used 10 which another guy about the same height as me was using. It ended up being slightly too high, but I ended up being ok since I got a lift-off.

**107.5kg (236.7lbs), 3 whites:** This was really easy even though my setup was a bit off and I wasn't as tight as I could be.

**112.5kg (248lbs), 3 whites:**  This was slow and felt a little hard.

**115kg (253.5lbs), 3 whites:** This was actually easier than the 2nd attempt, and my hamstring even cramped while doing it! Felt good to finally get this since I missed it at my last meet.


**Deadlift**

Up until this point I was on a roll, I got all of my squat and bench attempts with all white lights, and was well on my way to hitting all PRs and getting that 400 wilks. I needed at least 536lbs on the deadlift and I was planning on doing 22lb jumps, going from 496 to 518 to 540. Unfortunately this is where it all fell apart.

**225kg (496lbs), 3 whites:** Slower and harder than I expected.

**235kg (518lbs), 3 reds:** Even with how my opener felt, I thought I could grind this one out no matter what because I've done more in the past. I was wrong and I missed the lockout.

**235kg (518lbs), 3 reds:** Didn't even break the floor.

So what happened here? I'm not quite sure. There's a couple things that factor into it. This meet was running EXTREMELY late. It didn't start until 2:30pm and I wasn't deadlifting until almost 8pm at night. I was able to get pretty amped up all through squats and bench, but once I got to that 2nd deadlift attempt I was feeling exhausted. Another problem was that the bar they were using for deadlifts was very thick and stiff, whereas the bar I've been using recently and at my last meet was a deadlift bar that was much thinner and provided some whip.


**Results**

I didn't do as well as I wanted to and I didn't qualify for the 2014 Arnolds, but I think this was still a valuable learning experience, and I'm still happy that I was able to hit a squat and bench PR.


**Final thoughts/remarks**

I have to give huge props to /u/dedmaker and /u/frostedlard for cheering me on. Dedmaker also gets extra props for being my handler, without him helping me it would have been a much more stressful event, so I'm very grateful.

The announcer and music were HORRIBLE. The announcer almost never called out the weights people were lifting (my family/friends at home watching the livestream didn't even know what the weights were). Just listen to the announcer in the background of my lifts video, he sounds like he's drunk. It's also unacceptable to ever play Eiffel 65 - Blue at a powerlifting meet, how are people supposed to get amped up to that shit? I was lucky in that they actually played Metallica while I was squatting.

So what am I going to do next? I know for sure that I'm done with the 163lb weight class with a 2 hour weigh-in, and I'm still on the very low end of the next weight class (I was the lightest person in the 182 class). I'm probably going to stick with doing 165 with a 24 hour weigh-in for awhile until I get big and strong enough to compete in the 181/182 weight classes.
For my next meet, I may be looking at going to IPL Worlds in November with some others from my gym. I may do Raw Nationals again next year, but I'll wait and see where I'm at. If I can for sure get 400 wilks then and qualify for Arnolds in 2015, then I'll probably do it, otherwise not. It was a lot of money to go down there and compete and unless I know for sure that I can get something out of it it's not worth it.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,vpm3,True,t3_1iv3us,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1iv3us/meet_report_usapl_raw_nationals_orlando_fl_1201/,

Now, pretty much every American athlete is familiar with the power clean, as are a lot of gym rats (even if it's known as ""the movement I do to get the bar to my shoulders while I do quasi-push presses with back bending that would make Alexeev cringe""). I'm referring to snatch pulls, power shrugs, snatch grip deadlifts, snatch shrugs, clean pulls (or shrug pulls, for the old school crowd), etc.

For me, I do these a lot, and I prefer them to deadlifts to be honest. I think the explosive nature (as well as the overall weight issue) of them really lend themselves very well when training at a higher frequency. If I were to deadlift 2-3x a week, it would cripple my upper/lower back for any sort of overhead work or squatting. I find that pulls really don't have the same effect (though I do tend to get some serious upper back fatigue from doing shrugs for weeks on end).

In my search for great athletes I noticed that *a lot* of throwers do these, so if you're an athlete that needs explosive power (and there really aren't a lot that don't), it would probably help putting them in somewhere. /u/jacques_chester and /u/olympic_lifter are gonna come in and tell you that there are serious benefits to doing full snatches and C&amp;Js. They *will* convince you and I can't really beat either when it comes to discussing this matter so keep that in the back of your head when you're considering pulls.

Plus, they build a thick ass back and Rigert style traps...and who doesn't want that?

If you're a bit clueless about how to do pulls, I'd suggest [Clarence Kennedy's website](http://weightliftingfix.com/category/the-lifts/), he has great tutorials and really good cues (also does 170kg clean pulls for what seems like endless sets of 3 at around 85-90kg BW, so he knows what he's talking about). He also points out that your pull doesn't need to look the same as everyone else's, he for instance doesn't use hip drive in snatch pulls, so you have to experiment a bit with what you like (and what helps achieve your goals).

Basically, you tweet 

    @liftsick record bench 225-8

    or

    @liftsick record military_press 135-5 155-3 175-1


and it records that you bp'd 225 for 8 reps, then sends you back a link to a report showing your record lifts at various rep ranges.

If there is interest in the idea, I will keep building it, as I will use the service myself. If there is too much interest, I'm pretty sure the way I have it set up will break. Anyway, feel free to try. I'd appreciate some sample data. Please don't rely on me to keep your data safe, for now, just in case.

This last December I competed in the AAPF Viking Challenge, my first powerlifting meet. It was a pretty small meet, but everyone was really encouraging. In attendance were Scot Mendelson, Pavel Tsatsouline, and former Masters DL world record holder Kevin Fisher. Well, here goes.

**Prep**

A few months out, I weighed 230lbs and I felt really fat. (I'm 6'2""; I fully plan on being reasonably lean at 220-230 by mid 2014, but I've got a while before then). My original plan was to drop to just below 198 and compete in that weight class. This required a somewhat aggressive caloric deficit, which ended up taking its toll on my lifts (most especially my deadlift; I hit a fairly easy 500 at 225 but struggled with 480 at the meet). Two weeks out I got a terrible bout of food poisoning and was shitting water for about five days. Believe me, I dropped to sub-198, but I was weak as hell. As soon as I recovered (about a week before), I went no-holds-barred on eating and weighed in at 209 while wearing clothes and shoes. My bathroom scale said 204 while I was naked, so I'll just go with that.

Anyways, I had a few other injuries leading into this meet. I had a mysterious lower back pain (which I still feel; I suspect it to be a minor L5/S1 herniation, but I haven't had it examined yet). Also, I bought a 13mm Inzer Lever belt which cracked my rib because I cinched it too tight. That still hurts too but it doesn't hamper my lifts except for bench. On top of this, my brachialis had been hurting from low bar squatting, so until one week out I trained only high bar squats.

**The Meet**

[Video of 5/9 attempts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qg1NJYxRs0&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Squat

* 165/363.8 - conservative opener, made it easily. I had hit this for a triple about six days out.

* 172.5/380.3 - slightly challenging. I had hit this for a single three days out.

* 185/407.9 - new PR, and I'm calling it my first 2xBW squat.

Squats felt good, but I may have lowballed my numbers under the belief that performance anxiety would make me weaker. It didn't, though--I felt great and may have been able to squat a few kilos more, but I'm just happy I made my attempts.

Bench:

* 110/242.5 - This went up easily enough.

* 117.5/259.0 - This went up slow (embarrassingly).

* 125/275.6 **fail**- Only failed attempt of the meet. I should have gone for 122.5 and just put a good number on the board.

Bench kinda sucked because it took forever. A lot of people did single-event for the bench, including Scot Mendelson, who attempted something like 1070lb (equipped of course). Scot ended up taking about 45 mins to warm up, and he used the stage to do it. This ended up slowing down the meet a lot. This felt like a really conceited move on his part, even if he is the chair of the AAPF. But whatever, it gave me a good rest after squats.

Deadlift:

* 200/440.9 - Again, conservative opener. I'd struggled to get 455 in the gym about a week before, so I was nervous about my DL at the meet.

* 212.5/468.5 - Easy enough.

* 217.5/479.5 - Actually something of a struggle. Losing weight took its toll on my deadlift.

Deadlift was fun because I got to warm up with Kevin Fisher, who deadlifted 305kg raw later that evening. Also, Pavel Tsatsouline was there to coach his 70+ year old father, Vladimir Tsatsouline. Vladimir ended up deadlifting 185kg, which was extremely impressive to watch (I didn't think to get it on video). While I was warming up, Pavel was offering his dad some chalk. I was standing about a foot away and he asked if I wanted some chalk, too. I told him sure, I'd love some. After I chalked up and handed him the block, he said (completely deadpan) ""Coffee? Tea?""

**Overall**

This was a tiny meet and I was the only one in my weight class. I walked away with a golden viking trophy (sweet) and a lot of encouragement from the other lifters--some first-timers, some veterans. However, while this was a great time, it made me long to compete in my true interest which is Olympic weightlifting. I will continue to train in powerlifting for a while, but it's not quite as exciting as Oly for me.

Cool stuff I saw that wasn't directly related to my lifts:

* Vladimir Tsatsouline, age 74, deadlifting 185kg. He and I exchanged a ""flex fist"" gesture as we walked by each other later on (he only spoke Russian).

* Kevin Fisher, 59, deadlifting 305kg (wtf)

* Harj Basi [smashing all kinds of records](http://www.powerliftingwatch.com/node/24003). She wore a crossfit shirt but I think that's forgivable.

I've done a similar setup for the past three years or so, rarely missing more than a few days at a time, and never more than a week.

Yet I find myself just not wanting to do certain movements I know are good assistance and prehab. After struggling with different nagging injuries, aches, pains, etc. I've managed to figure out some good substitutions with exercise I really enjoy to replace the ones that seem like a chore. I figured I'd share them, and see how others have done this as well. 

Hated exercise: Face Pulls

Awesome alternative: 5x5 Overhead squats once a week, fixed all of my external rotation issues and my shoulders have never felt better


Hated exercise: any kind of row- barbell, cable, Pendlay, I hate them all

Awesome alternative: clean and snatch pulls, power cleans and snatches, and chest to bar pullups/chinups have done more for my traps and mid/upper back strength than years of hating rows


Hated exercise: any kind of thoracic mobility

Awesome alternative: handstands, overhead squats, and front squats have helped my thoracic mobility way more than all the stretching and foam rolling I've ever done. I still do twisting mobility work but that's about it. 


Those are the main ones I can think of right now. So, what good assistance work do you hate, and what have you replaced it with?

Edit: formatting

Edit 2: I think you guys are missing the point here, I'm talking about how you have found prehab/assistance exercises that you enjoy, instead of boring things that feel like a chore. All of this ""I do what I hate because it makes me stronger"" is completely irrelevant to the question, you're just trying to sound all high and mighty because you force yourself to do something you don't like.

* I have been lifting for about 3 years. I got close to my current numbers about a year and a half ago through a hodgepodge of linear progression programming and a little 5/3/1, at which point I shattered my ankle skating and lost all my gainz. Finally got back to my old numbers in January--mostly through fuckerounditis--and have been doing 5/3/1 since.
* No fancy supplements, just a multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin D, and whey
* Diet-wise, I just try to eat enough food but not too much and eat a lot of protein and veggies
* I also play roller derby, but am in the off-season right now, so I decided to get into PL!

**Meet Prep** 

I basically just took the few days before the meet off of lifting to make sure I was well rested.

I usually walk around at 125 lbs, so I figured the 123 class would be no problem. However, I managed to screw up my birth control while out of town a few weeks ago, turning shark week into shark month, complete with extra bloating. I got up to 130, and was down to 127 by Thursday night. I loaded water all week, and then cut carbs on Friday. Stopped drinking water late in the day and took a couple hot baths. Weighed in Saturday morning at 123.1, .3 under! 

Was very happy there was an IHOP next to the venue, had eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, and french toast. I love breakfast

**Lifts**

I only went 6 for 9 -- attempted to PR on my third attempts and missed them all. That was a bummer, but I was still very happy that I only missed lifts because I couldn't handle the weight, not because I fucked up the commands or moved my feet or something.

I don't have a belt yet, so that's why you don't see one here.

**[Squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lfgfaqPJmw)** 

* 67.5 kg (148.8 lbs) - Easy peasy opener
* 75 kg (165.3 lbs) - Either this was too low, or my third attempt was too high. I know I can do 175, so I should have done that and then gone for the 180 PR. These 10 lbs cost me my 500 total goal.  Blah!
* 82.5 kg (181.8 lbs) - Felt light on my shoulders, clearly not in the hole!! My back failed me

**[Bench](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Llfh0wTqlk)** 

* 40 kg (88.1 lbs) - Light and easy
* 45 kg (99.2 lbs) - I've done this before, once. Have failed at other gym attempts, so glad I got it!
* 47.5 kg (104.7 lbs) - Glued to my chest.

**[Deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezwASWu_-6M)** 

* 90 kg (198.4 lbs) - Easy opener
* 102.5 kg (226 lbs) - More of a grind, but I got it.
* 105 kg (231.5 lbs) - Doesn't move an inch

**Thoughts**

Though I didn't get the 500 total I wanted or make all my lifts, I had a lot of fun and am glad to have done my first meet! I met a lot of cool people... it was great just to get to talk about lifting all day, especially other women. Only one of my friends lifts (he's there with me, behind the camera), so that's a rare experience.

I did win my weight class... which no one else entered!

I'm doing another meet in a month... I should have a belt by then and will be able to weigh in the night before, so I'm hoping I can set some PRs there!

Thanks for reading, any advice is welcome!

**Meet Details**


Coming off the Battle on the Border, I wasn’t planning on doing any more meets until at least after the summer.  However, I learned soon after the meet that I didn’t actually break American records with the numbers I put up because there weren’t national judges for the lifts.  So I entered this meet to make them official and to see if I could improve my total in such a short time.

**Meet Prep** 


In terms of training, I didn’t change much from the previous meet to this one but my last write up is pretty vague to I’ll go a bit more into detail.  [Here](http://imgur.com/tWswvIn) [And Here](http://imgur.com/ZmEZeKJ) are my primary lifts with reps during the 4 to 5 weeks leading up to the meet. Sets marked as 1.5 or 2.5 are really sets of 2 and 3 but I write them like that to denote ""heavy"" spotting.  For me on bench that's the spotter's hands on the bar as soon as it's off my chest. I like training 6 days a week in 2 3-day cycles.  The three day cycles are split Legs/Chest &amp; Arms/ Back &amp; Shoulders.  I’ve never seen programming quite like this before, it’s what my dad and I came up with and its worked pretty well for as long as I’ve used it which has to be at least 2 years by now.


Usually each cycle has one heavy lift and one light lift.  For instance, if I squat on the first day of a cycle, I’ll do lighter stiff-leg deadlifts on the third day of the cycle.  If I bench heavy during the first cycle, I’ll bench a bit lighter close-gripped and incline.  The scheduling is also not set in stone, you can see I skipped a rest day to go 6 in a row so I could squat heavy on memorial day because I wouldn’t have to work.  As you can see, I live off of sets of 5 and fewer reps.  I like training for meets like this because I usually don’t cut much weight and putting up near max numbers in the gym often helps me feel comfortable with heavy weight.  I also don’t really like the idea of big peaking programs, rather I just taper off my accessory work and take most of the week before the meet off.


As for dieting, I only had to drop between 3 and 4 pounds for this meet and once I figured out a diet that I could easily replicate and fit into my daily routine, I stuck with it.  At first I tried strictly Keto but I found that I was cheating with too much and too often so I scrapped that and just tried to eat simple and lean.  However, I found that as I refined my diet it tended to quite low carb.  A sample day on the last week before the meet would look like this:


Breakfast:

2 Eggs - ~140 Cal
2 Strips turkey bacon- ~ 60 Cal

¾ to 1 cup of egg whites - ~120 to 150 Cal depending on the brand I buy that week

I like to microwave my bacon to get it crunchy very quickly and then I mix that with my eggs and make a sort of bacon frittata in a pan over the stove. It’s quick, easy, and actually quite tasty.


Lunch:

1 lb. of 93/7 ground turkey meatballs in a light spaghetti sauce - ~650 Cal


Dinner:

½ - ¾ lb. ground turkey or equivalent weight of grilled chicken breast - ~300-450 Cal

A lot (1-2 cups) of broccoli, frozen or fresh steamed - ~50/60? Cal, I never count vegetable calories

I would usually snack on almonds or mostly egg white scrambled eggs.  A weird goal I developed with this diet was to be at or below 1200 calories by the time I got home from work, that way I knew how much turkey or chicken I could have for dinner.

I drank 2-3 gallons of water the first two days of the week before the meet and slowly cut that to where I barely drank anything from noon the day before the meet to weigh in and made weight just fine at 146.8, just half a pound heavier than the meet about 3 months before. I also brought my home scale to calibrate it to the USAPL scale which will be handy.

**The Lifts**

My biggest priority for this meet was matching the record breaking numbers from my last meet, once I hit those I wasn’t really concerned about my next attempt.  

*Squat*

*170/374

*180/396

*~~185/407~~

*Bench*

*122.5/269.5 

*~~130/286~~

*130/286

*Deadlift*

*195/429

*202.5/446

*207.5/457

[Lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13wtelqQv7U&amp;feature=youtu.be)
Third squat is M.I.A.


Squats always feel heavier at meets and this meet was no exception.  I sank my opener which felt much heavier than I thought it should so I went for a more conservative second attempt.  Once I hit that I was satisfied so I went with 407 which was more than I thought I could actually do.  I sank my third attempt super low and looking back I feel like if I cut it a bit higher I would’ve gotten the lift. But I didn’t, so I couldn’t.

I’m most comfortable at meets on the bench, I opened with 270 and smoked it so I figured 286 was in the bag.  I missed 286 the first time higher than I ever thought possible but was able to get it the next time around.

Deadlifts this time were a guessing game because I only did them twice leading up to the meet and both times were either doubles or singles.  At this meet I forgot that I had pulled 475 in the gym and only remembered pulling 455 for a very heavy double on May 18 (not on the calendar pictured).  For this reason my attempts were more conservative than they should’ve been and had I known I could pull 475 in the gym, I probably would’ve pulled more on my last attempt.  Each attempt felt the same form-wise, (pretty bad) just heavier with each lift.  I definitely feel like my sticking point is off the floor because each time I got the bar moving I knew I was getting the lift.

I ended up totaling 1140, which was good for the American record for total, in addition to squat and bench press.

**Future Plans**

I was informed after this meet that my &gt;400 Wilks would qualify me for the 2014 Arnold if I could replicate my performance at raw nationals on July 19 of this year.  I was totally unaware of this and had I known I would've just trained straight through to that meet instead.  I do plan on going to raw nationals and putting up a &gt;400 Wilks because the 2014 Arnold isn't until March which gives me plenty of time to get even leaner and stronger.  I plan on following about the same diet I did leading up to this meet, but I plan to throw some carbs in there somewhere so I’m not so sluggish at work or the gym. 

I plan on roughly following my 3 day cycles but I also need to start deadlifting off the floor again.  I stopped because I was getting terrible pain in my hips but knowing what I do now about stretching and recovery I can deal with it better if it comes back.  I also want to work in more incline/decline work, more shoulder work, and way more front squats.

This was my first powerlifting meet. I began lifting in October of 2011. I had done some lifting in the past but never anything consistent and I was still pretty weak when I started. Ran SS for about 6-8 months. Made awful progress on 5/3/1 for 4-5 cycles and then switched to Madcow. Saw some really good gains on Madcow but lifting for intensity twice a week for bench and squat started to catch up with me. My numbers were still going up but I didn’t feel right. I felt banged up and none of the PRs felt good. So after 24 weeks of Madcow I started a modified version of the GZCL method. After 2 months on it, I am really happy with the way I feel and the gains I have made. The combo that seems to work the best for me is to have one intensity day and one volume day for each lift. [Here is the template I made with some feedback from](http://i.imgur.com/pP2ASDS.png)  /u/GZCL. I also program OHP as a main lift because it’s boss as fuck and I want jacked shoulders. Supplements that I take are creatine, whey protein, vitamin D, magnesium, fish oil, melatonin, and St. John’s Wort.  I know St. John’s Wort isn’t a “lifting” supplement but a happy lifter is a focused and consistent lifter.

**Meet Prep**

As this was my first meet I didn’t concern myself with cutting. I opted out of the 24 hour weigh-in and instead went for the 2 hour weigh-in. I’m definitely fat enough that I could compete in the 198s but I ultimately decided that I wanted to get as strong as possible for my first meet and then decide on whether I want to drop to 198. As for my training leading up to the meet, it was a little off. I had a vacation to New Orleans 2 weeks out from the meet so there was a ton of eating and drinking for 4 days with no lifting. When I got back I hit 3 PRs which helped me decide my goals for the meet. The PRs were: deadlift 405x3, bench 250x3 (touch and go) and squat 365x3 (with wraps). Based on these I decided that my goals for the meet were to get a 440 deadlift, 275 bench, and 405 squat. The last week before the meet I deloaded everything and did some light assistance work.

**The Lifts**

Went 7/9. The videos are below. 

**Squat**

[155kg/342lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9BZyOni2vw) Make: Super easy. As stated, I tripled 365 in training 2 weeks prior. With the adrenaline of my first ever meet lift it felt like nothing.

[170kg/375lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw26D56Iv5c) Make: Also pretty easy. Led me to up my last attempt by 2.5kg.

[185 kg/408lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsLCBNjP1uY) Make: Had to grind it about halfway through. I think this was the perfect weight for my 3rd. 

**Bench**

[105kg/230lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPXSdoeBSkk) Make: Super easy. I’ve never benched with commands before so I wanted the first lift to be light enough that I could really focus on getting the cues right.

[115kg/255lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTQTAcXOmpk) Make: This lift was confusing. It should have been fairly easy but I got stuck for a second about halfway up. A little doubt crept in to my mind and caused me to change my third attempt to 265 lbs instead of 275.

[120kg/265lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBUlxNZMzvs) Miss: Figured out that I was missing leg drive on the 2nd attempt and smoked the 3rd. Like a total newbie I missed the rack command.  I’m about 50/50 as to whether I was good for 275 as planned. 

**Deadlift**

[172.5kg/380lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2d8QfJm5Bg) Make: Super easy. As stated, I’d hit 405x3 in the gym two weeks prior.

[192.5kg/424lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceV-BcI9RDk) Make: This also felt pretty easy. Based on this I increased by 3rd attempt to 450 instead of 440.

[205kg/450lbs](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-VveiGRHPY) Miss: Oops. Looks like I overestimated. The bar got up to my knees and my brain said NOPE really fucking loud. I was a little confused as I have never failed at that point in the lift before. Usually it’s off the floor or at lockout. I have never trained any variations of Deadlift and I think that I may need to start doing rack pulls and deficit deads to work on some weak points.

**Results**

My total was 492.50kg/1086lbs. Wilks was 300.5. There was nobody else in the Open 220 lb division so [I won first place.](http://imgur.com/b3QmxzD) I felt really embarrassed receiving an award for my weak ass total until I saw there was [a motherfucking Viking on it.](http://imgur.com/3donFgo)

**Final thoughts**

I’m really glad I took the step and did my first meet. One thing I will have to change is my warm ups. The anxiety of not getting to finish warming up and not having an available rack/bench/platform to warm up on freaked me out and caused me to start warming too early on all the lifts. For Deadlift I must have sat almost 30 minutes after my last warm-up until my first attempt. 
I thought I was going to break 1100 and I’m a disappointed that it didn't happen but I still feel good about my goal of getting a 1200 lb total without knee wraps by the end of the year. I was a little surprised that out of 80 lifters NOT A SINGLE ONE was in the 220 open division. I have no experience with other feds but my first impression on NASA is that they have way too many divisions. Every other lift was a “state record” and a lot of them were not terribly impressive. I’m looking forward to competing in the USAPL. After I finish about 3-4 cycles of the GZCL method I will make a post with results.

I am very new to lifting (but i'm really enjoying it!) and i'm very new to this subreddit so i apologize in advance if this topic is not appropriate.

The routine i'm currently following incorporates squats (wide stance, and i've been assuming that they are high bar squats).  Granted i've only had three or four session doing these but i just cant seem to remember everything i'm supposed to concerning form (back tight, breathing, chest up, butt out, push through heels, spread the ground with your feet, knees out, etc)  I've also started video taping myself to check.  What are some quick reminders or things you think about when executing squats to ensure you have the proper form?  For example, i read someone mentioning keeping your toes flexed and ""up"" to help push through the heels (i tried this today and it really helped).  any insight would be greatly appreciated!

1341780882.0,52,self.weightroom,w8hq2,"[Meet Report] Beast of the East of Tennessee Strongman Competition - 7/7/2012, Dunlap, TN. ",Nucalibre,57,5,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/w8hq2/meet_report_beast_of_the_east_of_tennessee/,"**tl:dr** First strongman competition, competed in lightweight open division, finished third out of three, had a blast, learned a lot, met awesome people.

I completed my first strongman competition yesterday. I've been training with purpose for about 2 years now, but began training specifically for this competition about 2 months ago. 

**Training History**
Three months or so on SS.
Dicked around for a while a la Texas Method.
Been running 5/3/1 and variations for a little over a year.

Haven't tested maxes in a while, but they should be ~440 squat, ~260 bench, ~515 deadlift, ~210 overhead press. My bench is dildoes, which is part of why I enjoy strongman.

Leading up to the competition I emphasized overhead pressing, as well as built a sled to drag and a pair of farmer's handles out of galvanized pipe and railroad ties.

**The Competition**
I weighed in at 199 lbs, and learned that I was the only lightweight novice to compete. They asked if they could bump me up to lightweight open since there was two competitors in that class, and I agreed. Some of the weights were therefore heavier than I'd trained for, but it turned out okay. Temperatures were in the mid to upper 90s for the competition, which was its own challenge.

* Truck Pull - First up was the truck pull, for the light weights a 16000 lb wrecker, 100 feet up a slight incline. I managed 94 feet in the most brutal minute of my life. Lessons learned: get as low as possible then get lower, get better shoes, extremely short choppy steps. Can't really complain though, one of the heavyweights managed to pull their 26000 lb dump truck about 30 feet with a broken foot.

* Viking Press - I'm most disappointed with how I did in this event. The lightweight was set at 250 lbs, but it got much much lighter once you cleared the top of your head. I'd gotten two quick easy reps warming up, but that was before the truck pull. My legs were still completely shot, I had near zero leg drive, and I barely managed to get 2 reps again when it counted. Need to get better conditioned and be stronger.

* Hercules Hold - I just completely botched this one. If we dropped it in the first 5 seconds we got a reset. I started to lose it to the left early on, but thought I could recover it. I couldn't, and it touched at a little over 8 seconds. Had I gotten settled properly I feel that my grip would have held for at least a respectable amount of time.

* Medley - 240 lb Farmer's Walk for 50 feet, 210 lb Log clean and pressx2, 300 lb sled drag for 50 feet. The Farmer's handles for the competition were much less cumbersome and easier to grip than the ones I'd put together, so the walk actually was pretty easy compared to everything else. Unfortunately the log press was not. I'd never used a log before, and had only gotten to play around with one a little before the competition. I was able to clean it to my chest twice, but didn't manage to press it once. Didn't get to the sled drag at all.

* Atlas Stones - I was nervous about the stones, as they were another implement I'd never touched before. However, the other two lightweight competitors helped me out a ton throughout the day, and gave me a lot of advice on how to do the stones. They also let me borrow tacky since I didn't have any of my own. That stuff is effective, but nasty. For the lightweights the stone run was 200, 230, 265, 300, 330 lbs. I got the first three stones in a little over 24 seconds. I got the 300 lbs stone to my knees twice, but didn't drop my hips low enough fast enough to lap the stone. With a little better technique, I know I could get a 300 lb stone. Overall, I loved Atlas Stones, they are a blast.

In the end, I came dead last in every event, but had a hell of a lot of fun doing it. And since there were only 3 competitors, I technically placed and qualified for nationals. I think I'll try a few more local competitions first though. I'm not sure when I'll be able to compete again as I have to start writing my dissertation soon, but I can't wait. It was awesome.

In terms of the gym, the gym was really nice, but it seemed surprisingly crowded.  I thought there would be more space for movement, but it seemed like there were a lot of racks and other machines to work with.  There must have been a hundred different types of bars you could use.

The coaches that spoke were:

**Jeremy Frey:**

* Dropoff in power for static stretching before working out is minimal, go ahead and do it if you need it
* Working with someone that can't do a single push-up?  Use dumbbell work.

**John Meadows:**

* mTor is what turns on protein synthesis
* Do not do post-lifting cardio if you are trying to build muscle, as it turns of mTor

**Steve Pulcinella:**

* Really didn't have anything very substantial, but by far the funniest speaker there, and probably one of the most entertaining speakers ever.
* [Triangle of domination](http://davefarinelli.com/TriangleOfDomination.png) was awesome.

**Chad Smith:**

* As you get stronger, you have to focus more on recovery.
* In-season for sports:  Don't use a lot of exercise variation

**CJ Murphy:**

* Strongman training is great functional strength
* Generally cannot compete well in both strongman and powerlifting at same time:  Pick one.

**Josh Bryant:**

* Single best assistance move for raw squats:  Pause squats
* Dips have a great transfer to overhead press

As it was about 95 degrees outside in London, OH, it was hot enough in the gym that I was constantly sweating, especially during the training sessions.

In terms of any kind of swag, I received a shirt, blender bottle, and free Spike energy drinks, protein bars, protein powder, and more.

In the two days, each day would have the morning consisting of lecture, and the afternoon being coaching on different lifts depending on the day.  On Friday, it was bench, strongman, and rehab, and on Saturday, it was squat and deadlift.

For my coaching, I had Dave Kirschen as my main coach, in what I would consider being one of the novice/intermediate groups (us being matched up based on our raw squat, bench, and deadlift).  I didn't have too many cues or changes that I needed to make for my lifts in particular (some people needed to have everything torn apart and start over).

**Bench**

Dave had us work up to a PR on benches (we didn't work up to PRs on anything else, which i don't really understand)  I was able to set a 20 lb. PR on my bench by learning how to activate my lats and bring in my elbows more, so small things like that can really help.

**Strongman**

We had Steve Pulcinella work with us on the Axle Clean and Press, and had all of us work up to 210 lb. for singles.  A little bit more complex than it looks, especially at heavier weights.

**Squat**

Dave had everyone start with box squats (or basically exaggerated cues of free squat).  Being my first time, I struggled with this for a few sets, but eventually understood it.  A big change, for those who haven't done box squats before, is that you will really feel like you are sitting back, as to where you would fall back if the box were not there.  Dave mentioned that my free squat form was just fine, so no changes to need to make there.

**Deadlift**

The only real tips that we got as a group were to check whether we would like sumo or conventional deadlift.  We would try each one, and move from there.  After just a few reps, it was clear I pull with a conventional deadlift.

At the end, Dave Tate had a quick speech about business values (in a sense of being a trainer or owning a gym), which I ended up leaving early since I don't have any interest in either.

As to whether I would recommend it, I think it was definitely a good trip.  Part of the issue in getting a totally effective coaching period is that you need to be in a middle ground in needing just a few things to fix in your form (you could either be in a case where everything had to be fixed and would get overwhelmed, or there was nothing to change, and you were just confirming you were doing things right).  I ended up paying about $500 for the entire trip when you consider travel and lodging.

**TL;DR; - Went to the EliteFTS Learn to Train 4 seminar over the weekend.  Some good stuff, set a new bench PR for 295 lb. at 200 lb. BW, was a good experience overall.  Steve Pulcinella is hilarious.

Went 6/9 on my lifts, missing a squat and two presses


**Squat**

* 110kg - felt great, I went depth and then some on this one, the judges were being strict for the previous Flight and it being my first lift, my nerves got the better of me
* 115 - Personal Record by 3kg, and what my 1RM should be at according to [strstd](http://www.strstd.com/)
* 117.5 - I think the depth got the best of me on this one, had I gone shallower I think I could have made the lift

**Bench**

* 72kg - raised my ass of the bench by about a centimeter right at the press command
* 75kg - PR &amp; National Record for Age &amp; Class
* 80kg - felt like I could do it, I lost my tightness during my struggle and didn't get the lift

**Deadlift**

* 136kg - hit this as a 3RM few weeks before, was very uncertain on my potential DL 1RM
* 142.5kg - PR 
* 147.5kg - PR &amp; National Record, felt as though I could have gotten 150kg

**Results**

I walked out with a **total of 340kg** and placed 1st in the 82.5kg Youth class. [Gold(ish) Medal](http://i.imgur.com/AkaKu.jpg)

**Records**

I was the first 82.5kg youth to ever compete (On account of me being tall &amp; skinny, those my age were in the 60-77kg range) in this federation, technically any lift I made over 25kg was both an Ontario and Canadian National Record. I like the fact I can call myself a record holder, but I know I have a long way to go if I am going to get up and compete in the Teen division.


**Final Thoughts**

* Awesome first meet!
* My nerves got the best of me on all my missed lifts (except 1st bench) and I think if I was more focused and stayed tight I could have easily made a ~5-10kg higher total.
* I was absolutely shocked at how nice the PL community is. I've heard stories about Strongman Comps and PL comps being home to some of the nicest people around, and today was no different. Everybody was incredibly encouraging of everyone, I had some good friendly conversations with people years older than me in my weight class.
* I have the Canadian National High School Championships on June 1st, stayed tuned!
* Note to self: get some smelling salts. Squat the world.

* This was my 3rd meet since I began powerlifting about 1.5 years ago. I usually cut some water weight and go down to the 198 class, but looking back this was a stupid idea and I should have always just gone into the meets weighing what I usually walk around at. I wasn't going to break any records and I really wasn't lifting to my full potential (being dehydrated and all). For this meet I decided to just step on the scale and face whatever number came up. It was 209lbs, which was pretty normal for me.

* My diet during the whole thing was pretty clean and I kept protein as high as I could. Pre, peri, and post workout nutrition is a waste of time if you ask me. Just eat a surplus of good food and train your ass off. 

**Meet Prep**

* At my last meet at the end of March I total 1160 at 197. I left the meet disappointed in my lifts and just not really happy with the numbers I hit. I needed to change that. I decided to run the whole 12 week smolov squat program. All the things they say about smolov are true. My hips and knees really took a beating, but a surplus of food and fish oil helped me get through it. I went against peoples advice and I actually switched from high bar to low bar in the middle of the program. I did the base cycle with a high bar position and the intense cycle with a low bar position, but it worked out so HA!

* For 8 weeks I ran a program that I made up and it worked fairly well. About a month out from the meet I decided to drop my bench program and run a hybrid smolov jr for my bench, just cause. I called it a hybrid cause I just didn't have the time to run the whole thing.

* I have always been a strong puller so negating the deadlift for 13 weeks didn't really worry me. (I actually pulled twice during the switching phase, but shhh, don't tell the Russians)

**The Lifts**

* [Meet Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0qUFtha4c&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUEu6VrMQiXV0kisme2VoE7w)

* I went 8/9 and hit almost all my goals for the meet

**Squat**

* 385, make: Easy opener. It isn't on the video, but let me describe it. I went down and then I came back up

* 410, make: 5lb PR Felt ok. I didn't keep my upper back tight enough and my chest kind of fell, but I still got it up pretty easily

* 425, make: 25lb PR! Grinded a little just above parallel, but it felt great

**Bench**

* 265, make: Easy opener. I tripled this weight for multiple sets in a row during training so it didn't even worry me

* 285, make: Ties my gym PR, but this was much much smoother than when I did it about 4 months ago

* 305, make: 20 PR! This felt great. I never went higher than 275 for reps in training so I guess reps are the thing that are going to help bring my bench up

**Deadlift**

* 485, make: Easy Opener is the theme at this meet and deadlifts were no different

* 525, make: Ties my gym PR. It was much smoother than when I pulled it in the gym as well

* 545, miss: Grinding out deadlifts is definitely a new thing to me so when I struggled to pull it to my knees I was in a new world. I feel like if I got the bar about 1” higher I could have pushed my hips through and locked it out. Next time.

**Results**

* I placed 1st in the Open Amateur Raw Classic division with a 1255 total @ 209lbs
* This was a 95lb meet total PR

**Final thoughts**

* Now that I look back I can honestly say that I learned a lot from this meet prep. The most important thing being that I was selling myself short and I never really pushed myself during training. I'm not saying that I forced myself to the edge for this meet prep, but I definitely know that I am capable of much more. 

* My next meet is in October and my goal is 1300+ at the same body weight. ",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_1hh3nz,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1hh3nz/meet_report_2013_connecticut_state_battle_of/,

(148 lb weight class)",Barbelladdict,61,8,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1a2apc/meet_reportbio_apa_gatorland_raw_classic_arcadia/,"Stats- I am 19 years old, 5'3(my friend said I was 5'2 in his post -_-.) currently weighing at 140 lbs. I compete in the 148 weight class.

I was somewhat disheartened by some of the struggles I had today in my performance. Though I have been training really hard and I got plenty of sleep in the past week, I did not perform my lifts as well as I thought I would. On a brighter note, I won 1st place for the teen age group, my best friend and a buddy of ours took 2nd and 3rd. I am taking today as sheer learning experience.

Results-
Squat:
 
Opener: 330 lbs- three good lift signals, felt really easy

2nd attempt: 355 lbs- scratched the lift, my upper body was too far 
forward and rendered me from standing all the way up

Final attempt: 355 lbs- three good lift signals, broke state record on squat.

Bench:

Opener: 235 lbs- Went up like it was nothing, good lift.

2nd Attempt: 265(max)- Failed attempt, felt weak all of a sudden

Final Attempt: 265- started off good, foot slipped, failed lift. I was very upset.

Deadlift:

Opener: 315 lbs- 3 Good lift signals. Felt light.

2nd Attempt: 340 lbs- Got it up fine, feet started moving, scratched lift.

Final Attempt: 340 lbs- Good lift, nice new PR.

Overall:
Totaled at a 930, I was not too happy with how my bench went but I still did decent on the account of my weight and getting over being ill for about two weeks. If I could have gotten a 275 bench and a 260 deadlift, I would have broken all three state records and held the title. I have a meet in may that I am feeling confident that my best friend and I will do well in. I have a couple days rest, then back hitting the weights on wednesday.

My weightlifting history:
This is now my 5th year competing in competitive lifting. I started when I was a freshman in high school, benching only 175 lbs and C&amp;J 115 lbs. I did not make varsity but I still placed 3rd in most meets. Sophomore year I did not gain too much, I maybe got up 15 lbs in each lift. My junior year however was my upbringing. I was sick of being made fun of because of my height and I wanted to feel like I was superior in at least one sport. I worked my ass off. I ate right, slept a lot, I thrived on being in the weightroom. I won first place in all regular meets. I ended up shooting my maxes to a 215 lbs bench and a 170 lbs C&amp;J. I was 2nd in the district but won the regional championship, I made it to states. I placed 15th that year. My senior year was even better, saw gains every week. Won every meet, won districts, placed 2nd in regionals that year, and had a 3 way tie for 10th place at states. I lifted a 235 lbs bench and a 200 lbs C&amp;J. 
     This fall I met my best friend who is also my partner in crime in the weightroom. We constantly worked out and got stronger. He made gains faster than I did and it sent a strong sense of inspiration in me. He and I thrived off of achieving new goals and helping each other out. We eventually got sick of our school's gym and sought out the perfect gym for us. Just as he posted, we went all over the place and eventually found Lion heart Gym. We felt instantly at home. We have the most talented and helpful trainers, Morgan Mann and Joey Scalzo. Leon Barry helps us out too, he is in his 70s and still reps 315 on bench like it's paper. Joey Scalzo is my idol. He is also a man of shorter stature and he is built like a tank. He is everything I wish I could be. squats over 500, benches around 495, he even deadlifts over 400. Like I said, he is a tank. We started training there late January and were on an intense training cycle. My friend who has also posted his report has all of that information. I have never felt this strong in my entire life, my friend could say the same. 
    
The impact the weightroom has had on my life:
 For me, this is a huge deal. I have been dealing with issues my whole life. I was born a month premature and weighed a little over 2 lbs. I was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrom as a child and had to overcome many obstacles and social barriers, it was predicted I would not live a normal life unless action was taken immediately. I had therapy for the first few years of my life 6 days out of the week. I do not remember much but I just remember having some sort of therapy every day. Due to my pre-maturity, I have stunted growth. I was under 40 pounds until 4th grade. I had to take Human Growth Hormones(HGH) as a kid(around 9 years old) to help myself grow. It has helped a lot. I grew a good 6-8 inches in height. I am now a totally different person than I was years ago. My life is consumed by weightlifting and I think I would marry a barbell if I could. This meet was an eye opener for me today. These past few years have been. I have realized that it does not take someone to be tall and huge to be strong. It takes the will and the dedication. Without the weightlifting, I would have never known I could ever possibly do any of the things I do. It has forever changed the way I see myself. 

 I know this whole section is not about my meet but I thought it was necessary to put a bit of myself into this seeing that this is my first post. I do need help and suggestions on ways to improve my deadlift, it is my weakest area and I need outside perspective. Please feel free to comment your training method or any idea that comes to mind. Any help will be greatly appreciated. Have a good night and remember to never accept limitations and lift hard and proud.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_1a2apc,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1a2apc/meet_reportbio_apa_gatorland_raw_classic_arcadia/,

1364158836.0,51,self.weightroom,1axl72,[Meet Report] - USAPL 31st Annual Florida State Open Championship - 946lbs @ 129.36lbs - 373.627 Wilkes,HWLesq,61,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1axl72/meet_report_usapl_31st_annual_florida_state_open/,"First meet ever so I was nervous / excited.  I am gonna copy the format from meltmyface because it was easy to read and informative.

Meet Prep

I signed up for this meet in January so I had just over 3 months to try to peak.  I transitioned from madcow to a smolov jr for bench and squat.  I threw in some deadlifts on the weekends and focused on singles.

Making Weight

I am normally around 135lbs, but I got down to about 130lbs and stayed there throughout.  I didn't want to go through the entire process of cutting weight before the meet, so I tried to get as strong as I could at 130lbs.  I weighed in at 58.8kg.

Nerves

I put in a separate section because I did have some nerves/butterflies as it was my first meet.  I knew I am actually stronger when people are watching, but I was worried about messing up and not following commands.  I train solo at home so I tried to practice waiting for commands.

I was one of a handful of solo lifters without any real team affiliation.  A ton of people from FSU were there.  I sat around in my UF hoodie :) Go Gators!.  A lot of people had coaches and teammates so I felt a bit out of place.

Competition

I was worried that no one would even compete in my weight class because I want to compete against the best.  Then the start list came out and I saw that the state record holder from the 123lb category had moved up in weight and had been putting up good numbers.  I went from being nervous about winning without competition to being worried about not getting 1st place.  Turns out my competitor was a very nice guy and like me, lifts completely raw - no belt, wrist wraps... nothing.  

Squat

122.5kgs - 269.5lbs - Felt a bit heavy, but even when I warm up, my first heavy lift is difficult.  I still got good depth (ATG).

130kgs – 286lbs (PR) - This one felt good.  I was more worried about my next lift as I failed on 300lbs during training several times.  This was a PR by 1 pound.

137.5kgs - 302.5lbs (PR) – I didn't go as deep as usual, but I was well below parallel.  It was a bit of a struggle but I powered through.  

Bench

95kgs - 209.2lbs – This was very easy.  I wanted to open with 205lbs, but I decided to round it up in terms of kgs.  I made sure to study how long the judge would wait before giving the press command.

102.5kgs - 225.7lbs – I knew I could get this as I had done it with a pause during training.  Unfortunately, I felt like I almost tweaked my back/neck while locking it out.

107.5kgs - 236.7lbs (PR) – I failed to get this up in training so this was a good get.  I am gonna post a video, but I struggled.  I'm glad they didn't touch the bar because it came up slowly.

Deadlift 

165kgs - 363.7lbs - Went light and it came up very easy.

175kgs - 385.7lbs - 10kg jump because I knew I could get this, then try for a PR.  Came up without too much trouble.

185kgs - 407.7lbs (PR) – I knew I had to make a big jump if I wanted to get respectable numbers in comparison to my main competitor so I went big.  My competitor hit his second attempt of 175kgs and went for a state collegiate record of 182.5kgs.  He got 2 reds and a white on his 3rd lift so I knew I had to hit my lift.  It was not a huge struggle, but I had to power it up.  I think I may have left some weight on the bar.  I've lifted 410 before at 135lbs so I'm stoked to get 407.7lbs at 129.3lbs.

Overall

This meet was awesome.  I went 9/9, met some nice people, and had a ton of people give me lots of encouragement.  I am competitive by nature so I'm stoked about winning.  My main competitor lifted a total of 951.5 lbs at 59.5kgs and won the raw collegiate 60kg class.  I won the raw open 60kg class as I've been out of college for a while now. Overall, his wilkes was 371.691 and my wilkes was 373.627. YES!

My GF couldn't be there due to work, but my family made it out and my brother shot video for me.  He ended each video before they called good lift, but I'm glad he was there to record everything.  I'm glad I could have my family come watch.  They said they had a good time.  I would like to compete again and join the 1000lb club at this weight.  I have a lot of room for improvement on my squats.

For the future

I am going to look into continuing smolov jr or going with the base smolov for squats.  I can see my squat getting better by at least 25 pounds or so.  Adding 15 pounds to my deadlift would be great as that is my favorite lift.  The remaining weight would have to come from bench.  Smolov Jr really helped my bench so I may continue the same program.

Pictures and videos to come.

The videos aren't the best quality...some are out of focus.  I'm just glad I have any video at all.

Mashed them up into one video. :)

And the legend himself, [Tony Conyers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw0Xb4ZRmoA). 

I'm sure there might be others but these five guys are putting up some insane numbers at 165 pounds. This might be the most competitive class at RAW Unity this year.

1341928554.0,51,self.weightroom,wbsit,[ Meet Write Up ] USAPL Central FL Open - 1443 @ 212lbs,ErickStevens,61,10,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/wbsit/meet_write_up_usapl_central_fl_open_1443_212lbs/,"Normally I'm too shy to post one of these but for once I'm actually happy with how I performed. A little background: After spending close to 10 years training like a bodybuilder I took an interest in powerlifting late last year. I competed in my first meet in October of 2011 and totalled 1225 @ 198 with a 415 squat, 260 bench, and 550 DL. This was to be my fifth and final meet of my first competitive PL season, so I wanted to go out with a bang. All my previous meets were with RAW United and this was my first with USAPL. I almost skipped this meet as I became very rundown near the end of my prep cycle but I decided to stick it out and see what happened. 

We got a room in the same hotel that the meet was at the night before so I wouldn't have to wake up at the ass crack of dawn to drive two hours to weigh in. My entire training cycle I had hovered right around 215lbs (Thanks to the BioRhythm Diet!) but I still wanted to be careful so I was very conservative with my dinner that night. I ended up eating a big old sandwich from Larry's Giant Subs and a brownie that my fiancee had made. I really wanted to watch the UFC PPV that night but it turned out there was nowhere in the hotel that was showing it and we weren't able to watch it in our room. With nothing to hold my attention on TV I ended up falling asleep around 11PM and got 8 solid hours, marking the first time I've been able to get satisfactory sleep before a meet. After talking with some friends the next day I learned that the fight card ended up running long so I suppose it was a blessing in disguise. I was one of the first people to get down to the weigh ins and checked in a little over 212lbs. I got my equipment checked out and then headed back to my room to foam roll. 

The meet started on time at 9AM and began moving very quickly. There was an even mix of raw and equipped lifters although there was only a handful of females competing. The squat was the lift I had the least confidence in going into this meet based on the last couple weeks so I was very conservative with my opener of 485lbs. Warm-ups felt light so I wasn't too worried but I still didn't want to be ""That Guy"" and bomb out like an idiot. 485 felt like 485 but I didn't want to get too crazy, so I decided to make a conservative jump to 510 and see how it felt. Once I unracked it the side judge made said I wasn't upright enough so I ended up having to hold it a few seconds longer than I would have liked. Even with that delay it still felt easy, so I figured I'd go for 520ish and call it a day. While I was over at the scorer's table looking at the KG=LBs chart, my fiancee came over and asked what I was planning on going for next. I told her and with a disgusted look she said ""That's it?!"". I knew the record for the class was something like 526 and my squat PR was 530, so I kind of shrugged my shoulders and said ""540?"". She nodded and that was that. It wouldn't be the last time she inspired me to go for a big number. I knew 540 was good as soon as I unracked it. New USAPL 220 FL State record and a 10lb PR for me!

Bench was next. I hate benching. I had (finally) hit a 300 paused bench in the gym so that's what I was shooting for coming into the meet. The competition bench felt alien and I couldn't really get comfortable so I kind of knew a big PR wasn't coming. I played it safe and went 275, 285, and finished with a 2lb PR (lol) of 292.

After a 20 minute intermission it was time for my main event - The deadlift. I decided to open with 575, a weight that I was probably good for at least a triple with. Oddly enough this would also be a USAPL 220 FL State Record although I had no plans at stopping there. When I began warming up I immediately realized a critical mistake I made during my training cycle - USAPL uses a stiff bar for DLs and not a DL bar, so I knew it was going to be a rough adjustment. As soon as I walked out to the platform and looked down I knew I done goofed. The knurling was completely different than the bars in the back and I totally effed up my hand placement. You can see in the video my grip is actually outside of shoulder width which is insanely uncomfortable for Sumo deadlifting. My technique also blew ass as I let the bar get away from me and ended up doing a 575lb Romanian Deadlift while expending way more energy on an opener than you ever should. I knew that if I buttoned up my form that the second attempt would be much easier so I decided to go for 600. Just like I thought, my improved form made 600 fly up even easier than 575. I'd missed 600 on my third attempt at my last two meets, so this was a huge moment for me. I walked back to the scorer's table and contemplated skipping my third attempt as my lower back was obliterated by this point. After a brief discussion with my fiancee, it should come as no surprise that I put in 611 for my third attempt. It was a battle but I ended up grinding it out giving me an 31lb meet PR and an 11lb all time PR. 

After going 9/9 for the first time in my competitive PL career, I finished with a 1443lb total. It was my best ever total by 43lbs and also a 220 FL state record. I ended up winning first place in the 220 class and I also had the highest Wilks total of all the raw lifters at the meet. Oddly enough I didn't win best male lifter as I was bested by an equipped guy (wtf) for that award. I thought it was ironic that an organization that prides itself on it's level playing field wouldn't take suits, wraps, and bench shirts into account. Regardless, knowing I was the best raw lifter was enough for me and it gave me a good note to go out on for the year. 

What I Learned:

- Don't be your own worst enemy. No matter how weak or beat up you feel in the week(s) prior, all that matters is how you feel on game day. Don't psyche yourself out like I did. 
- Rest more. This was the first time I took the entire week before a meet off and it made a big difference. This is going to be a standard practice for me from now on.
- Longer training cycles. I'm going to take my time prepping for my meets next year and spend 8-10 weeks instead of my usual 6. This way I won't put so much pressure on myself to progress so quickly and end up running myself into the ground like I did this prep cycle.
- I need to get my bench up. Some how, some way. It has to happen.
- No DL bars during meet prep. Next time I prepare for a USAPL meet I'll be doing all of my pulling with a stiff bar.

Started ""lifting"" around 2008ish, was a bench/cardio/fuckarounditis bro for a few years, started serious training (aka actually deadlifting/squatting) in late 2010. Did my first powerlifting meet in December 2011 and went 6/9 (failed all third attempts) and totaled 1135 (something close to 360/275/500 @190lbs IIRC).

More recently I was really inconsistent with training from Summer '12 until this spring and all my lifts just kind of stagnated... thankfully squat and dead didn't fall really.

**Squat**

5/3/1 pretty exclusively. I've found if I follow the progression and actually am consistent I make steady progress here.

**Bench**

I've done a few bouts of SmJr for bench, one to hit 315 (early 2012) one to hit 350 (late 2012), but most of my programming was 5/3/1 between then and now, inconsistency played a role in my bench stagnating/dropping after 350. Again... staying consistent with 5/3/1 I get ""slow but steady"" increases in strength.

**Deadlift**

Basically stalled since late 2011, probably due to injury and just sucking at life. Went on Mag/Ort ~4 months ago and finally got this moving again about a month before the meet I hit [585lbs for an ugly as sin single.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REqyqhYUn8g)

## Meet Prep

The purpose of this meet initially was just to get comfortable on the platform and play around with water weight to see what I could do. 

**Lifting**

I didn’t really do any prep lifting wise other than some depth check of a few heavy singles on squats and started pausing some heavy doubles/triples on bench and then did one session the week leading up where I just hit some light weights to grease the groove. Still followed my basic progression I had been on the last few months.

**Water Weight**

Sorry… this is long first time I’ve actually cut weight for a meet.

This was… interesting. Weigh ins were 24hrs, and on the Friday before the meet. I walk around at 210-212 and signed up for the 198s. I did water loading, ~12L of water and 6,000mg sodium, at the beginning of the week tapered carbs a bit and cut all food/water/etc. off at noon on Thursday. Thursday morning I was 207. Thursday night I started doing hot baths for 20 minutes on 20 off, thank god for a laptop. I did about 6 sessions in the tub, at around 105-110 degF. After the 6th session I felt like shit my body temp was way too high and I felt light headed and wanted to pass out… and to make matters worse that session I only dropped .5lbs I went to bed at just over 202lbs around 11PM. Woke up randomly at 430 or 5AM and decided to weigh myself, was only down another .5lbs or 201.8. Took a less aggressive approach this time just under 105 degF water 15 minutes max aimed for 10-12 minutes and assessed how I was feeling after two sessions I was right at 200… laid down and took a nap. 7AM woke up and drew another bath again 100-105ish and did 10-15 on 20 off I felt like a champ, no overheating and still consistently dropping .5-1lb a session on average… 4 sessions later I was [89.5kg on my scale]( http://i.imgur.com/jLuvStq.jpg)... Yes I was so excited I took a picture. At the weigh ins (45 minute drive away) I stepped on the scale and it settled at… 90.1kg… “Guess you’re losing your boxers and socks”… 90.0kg

After a few liters of pedialyte, water, a liter of milk and a ton of food... I was back to ~210 on the platform the next day.

Special thanks to /u/Master_Cylinder for egging me on and keeping my moral up (and probably making sure I didn’t die) throughout this process and /u/NoMediocrity for letting me steal his water loading protocol.

## The Lifts

[Meet Video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXbvtjMtATc)

**Squat**

192.5KG/423lbs – Three Whites – Easy

202.5KG/445lbs – Three Whites – Not the easiest squat I’ve had but still solid decided only a 5kg jump

207.5KG/457lbs – Three Whites – Easy as the first actually turned around to see if I got reds on depth since I assumed I didn’t go deep enough since it was so easy… should have done 7.5 or 10KG 

**Bench** 

*insert comment about shitty hand-offs here*

145KG/319lbs – Three Whites – Stupid Easy jumped the rack command a bit

155KG/341lbs – Two Whites – Probably should have been all reds (downward motion), I’ve never really stalled on a bench like that

160KG/352lbs – Two Whites – Same stall position but bar kept moving upwards… though a bit unevenly

**Deadlift**

245KG/540lbs – Three Whites – Easy this solidified my place for the 198s (no one on my platform attempted this weight)

260KG/573lbs – Three Whites – Pretty solid, chose this attempt for dat der 400 Wilks rather than missing on a couple lb PR

272.5KG/600lbs – All reds – got it to the knee looked down and said “fuck this isn’t going anywhere” 

Again, I have to thank /r/Master_Cylinder for help with picking attempts since I can't math and he has more experience in meets than I ... oh and he and /u/jevanses for videoing my lifts so I could make an awesome montage.

## Results

* 1st place 198lb class (1383lb/627.5KG)

* AAPF Raw State Records for Bench/Deadlift/Total (tied another guy for the squat but he was a kilo lighter so he gets the record)

* AAPF Best Overall Male lifter

* [Got a fuckin’ sword]( http://i.imgur.com/TxCmJPp.jpg)

## Final Thoughts

Coming away from the meet I was crazy high that I had “won the meet” when I hadn’t really planned on doing anything spectacular. I had a ton of support from other redditors and the other lifters there in general. The other strong guy in the 198s was super supportive and we went back and for about attempts since we were so close in strength and it made it really fun, we were within 5KG or so total for quite a while but I opened my deadlift 25KG higher. The guy I warmed up with for squats and I would check in on each other when we crossed paths to see how the other was doing…. Everyone there was really cool.

Water weight wise… I think what I did Friday morning is the way to go, I felt a ton better than the 15-20 minute sessions and recovered/cooled down much faster when I kept the water hot-ish and time in the actual tub down below 15. I was also monitoring my core temp and the swings were much better in the shorter stents. Not sure I’ll do this for my next meet unless I’m still ~210, much heavier and I’m going to just be a 220.

Training, gotta work on my tightness for deadlift… grip and rip isn’t working when I get near 1RM like my 600lb pull. Bench… bringing back chains into my sessions, I never had lockout issues or stalling issues before so going to hit those harder for my next meet. Squat… just gotta keep pushing it upwards and get a bit tighter all around.

In terms of overhead work, I've been doing some jerking, but I've been working heavily on OHP/military pressing and push pressing.  I have a couple of questions.  First of all, how much difference in 1RM would you generally expect between a strict OHP and a push press?  This dovetails into my second question, why are my triceps so weak overhead?  I can narrow grip bench press 380 or so, with a pause, and if I'm going to miss a regular bench it will be close to my chest, not in the triceps, but overhead pressing or push pressing my sticking point is about 3-4"" from lockout.  I can strict OHP about 250 and push press about 265, and I would kind of assume that the difference should be greater than that, but with the push press launching it onto just below my sticking point in OHP, I wonder if the leg kick isn't helping as much as it could if my weak point wasn't in the lockout?  Does working overhead use a different part of the triceps than I'm used to or something what's with the discrepancy between my relatively strong triceps bench pressing and my relatively weak triceps overhead?

My grips weak due to a cut tendon 3 years back, so we created a program where i deadlift twice weekly once with straps to just get my number up without my grip holding me back and the other using a thick bar and some other grip work.  So today since i was off of work i decided to make a fat bar which only cost me 8$. These instructions assume you have a hex bolt barbell and not the pin locked kind.

* tools needed: 10mm hex wrench, vice grips
* supplies needed: two 2' x 1.5"" PVC pipes, duct tape and piping insulation
* Unscrew the hex bolt, using vice grips to hold the bar steady so it won't rotate with the bolt.
* Take the sleeve off
* Place on the insulation in two 2' sections
* Tightly wrap the insulation with duct tape, going from the collar to the center
* Slide the PVC pipe on, it will be tight so used a rubber mallet or a 1lb weight like i did to slide it on.
* Repeat with the other 2' sections of pipe and insulation
* Put the collar back on and you have yourself a fat bar!

In the future i might redo the bar with a 2"" PVC pipe, but this will do for now.  I really had to hold on tight for the last two reps, i can only imagine with some more weight on the bar how this will take my grip.
I intended to make a 2"" thick bar, but the local hardware store was out of 2"" pipes so 1.5"" will do for now. I hope you enjoyed my tutorial",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_1h7h3t,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1h7h3t/made_a_thick_bar_thought_you_guys_might_be/,

for at least 6 months now i've been running a bulgarian-style routine revolving around the main lifts, inspired by matt perryman: http://www.myosynthesis.com/workouts/bulgarian-style-training

and it's been good to me; in the past 3 months my squat has gone from 155kg to 175kg, and my deadlift from 185kg to 220kg (hasn't done much for my pushing movements, sadly).

however gains are slowing down, and i'm starting to get frustrated by the fact that i feel less conditioned. i think my overall per-session volume has dropped in these 3 months (was made redundant in early february, and i would go to the gym twice a day during the work week. losing my job means i went from 11 sessions a week to 6), and i think it's what's ultimately holding back my lifts at this point.

i read greg's article on work capacity (http://gregnuckols.wordpress.com/2013/02/18/increasing-work-capacity/) and it's a great read, it really answered a lot of my questions. what i'm particularly curious about is what has worked for people on here; there's a lot of ways to skin a cat and some advice on choosing a particular methodology would be great.

So I've been lifting for about a year and a half now and hadn't had chance to compete yet. Decided that I needed to get my first meet down to see how I'd do. I've been bulking pretty hard all fall and didn't bother cutting for this, so I competed in the 220s. In the future I'm planning to cut down to the 165s, but for this time I was just in it for the experience. 

* Height: 5'6""

* Weight: 206lbs

**Squat**

I had a hard time deciding what to attempt on this.  My ultimate goal was to get over 400lbs, but I wasn't sure I'd get it. First lift at 335 was really easy,  so I jumped up to 385. That's the highest I'd ever done in the gym before. Lift was decent, though I tipped forward a bit and almost lost it at the bottom. Decided to go for 402. It actually ended up going really well, I think I left a little bit on the platform. Overall good.

**Benchpress**

Was really expecting this lift to suck. The best I'd ever done paused in the gym was 255, so I started at 235 and it was incredibly easy. Jumped to 255 and it also went really well. So at that point I wasn't sure where to go, so I jumped way up to 281. It still ended up feeling fairly easy, probably could've got a bit more on bench as well.

**Deadlift**

Finally I had deadlift. As with the other two lifts, I was really unsure what attempts to take. I was actually going to open with 405, but decided to move that up to 435 and it ended up being really easy. Moved up to 485 and barely got it. Grip was starting to slip a little bit and I got one red for it. Final attempt I really wanted to break 500, so I took 501. Again my grip failed before I could lock it out. If my grip had held, I am sure I would've got it. Pretty disappointed that I was so close and failed, but still got 30lbs more than my gym PR with 485.

**Overall**

I really enjoyed the meet. NASA ran it really well, there was very little downtime or wasted time. They kept things moving really efficiently and everyone was really friendly. Definitely glad for the experience. I went in really hoping for a 1200 total, but 1168 isn't too shabby either. Planning to keep bulking for another month or two, going to try to get closer to 1250 before I cut down. My ultimate goal is to cut down to the 165 weight class. But anyway, really good experience overall.

**Results**

* Squat - 200-212.5-222.5F

* Bench - 117.5-125-127.5

* DL - 245-257.5-265F

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMBuv8CQ8Js)

I picked the first 2 attempts on squat perfectly, but I got greedy on the third and paid the price by narrowly missing it. I'm happy with how bench and DL went, even though I had easily the worst bench in my weight class. I just didn't have enough gas for the DL, but I still PR'd which I'm fine with.

**Meet prep**

For the past 5 months I've been training using Sheiko, which has been a blast and boosted my total by about 55KG since I started it. Meet prep in terms of tapering was fairly straightforward, I cut down on volume and upped intensity gradually up until a week out. At that point I took squat and bench openers and began a nice deload. 

**Diet**

I was about 108KG 8 weeks out from this meet, so I ended up cutting a fair bit of weight leading up to the meet. I weighed in at 101KG a week out, so I water-loaded and cut carbs to make an easy weigh-in at 97.2KG the day before at weigh-ins

After weigh-ins I feasted to the point of nearly vomiting, then ate and drank some more. It was miserable but I stepped on the platform around 103-104KG, which was pretty nice.

**Day of the meet** 

The meet ended up being really long, the Meet Director tried to cap it at 60 lifters, but failed miserably and ended up 103 lifters. The lifting started at 10AM and the first session (which I along with the other heavyweights were in) didn't end until 7PM. There were raw guys mixed in multiply lifters, which made for a grand time. A few big names lifted at the meet, Tony Conyers was there (stole my seat even), Chad Walker, and some other freakishly strong lifters participated. 

The day of I ate tons of peanut butter, drank lots of energy drinks and gatorade, and sat around talking to the other lifters. I learned a lot listening to some of the guys talking, and I'm looking forward to my next training cycle and getting my bench out of the gutter.

I'm tired of seeing everyone just say ""ZOMG!!11! Yer not parallel, newbie!!"" 

What to look for:

* Bar racked slightly higher than nipple-high
* Solid deracking with no wobble or excessive walkout
* Squatting it out of the rack, not lunging it out
* Tight upper back
* Chest up
* Sitting back, keeping weight back on the heels
* Feet should appear bolted to the floor between reps
* Bar path should be over the center of the body, not in front of it
* Deliberate breathing rhythm
* Knees track feet and don't buckle inwards
* Proper depth without relaxing to get there
* Locking it out at the top while standing up straight

Things that don't really matter and are personal preference:

* Visual focal point
* Stance width
* Elbows up or down (as long as back is tight)
* Hand placement on the bar (as long as back is tight)
* Placement of the bar on the back (as long as it's not on the neck)
* Knees traveling past toes.  Excessive travel is bad, but tall, lanky dudes don't really have much control over this.

Lifting seriously since Aug of 2012. Before this I was cardio bro, although I did do pushups/pullups plenty. First program was reverse pyramid ah la Martin Berkan. Then, 4 day bro-split of back/bi, chest/tri, legs, shoulders.

One day I Realized I wanted to get strong while remaining small. While looking for a powerlifting routine I discovered GZCL method. What does GZCL even mean? I didn't care. The dude was as strong as an OX. I'll try it. See [here](http://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-gzcl-method-for-powerlifting.html) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13n0j5/the_gzcl_method_for_powerlifting) for details on the routine.

**1st Cycle**

Did the program a laid out exactly. Programed my maxes way too high. I remember this the most because I developed tendonitis.. I think. Every damned joint in my body was sore... especially knees and elbows. I was legit scared I had arthritis. Squat/Bench 2x a week was tough. Took 2 weeks of deload and went for PR's. Joints still hurt but not as much.

Weight: 148lbs (on slow cut)

Squat: 245 &gt; 275

Bench: 220 &gt; 225

Deadlift: 305 &gt; 325

Press: 115 &gt; 135

Total: 825lbs

What really helped was adding Ghetto GHR's (no machine at LA fitness) and Bulgarian split squats to tier 2/3 for squats.

**2nd Cycle**

Squat routine stays the same. Added AMAP for deadlifts at the end of tier 1.
I was upset my bench didn't go up. Kept bench max the same. Added Ed Coan's bench routine to teir 2 work. Focused on Lat + tricep work for tier 2/3. Joints a little better but still sore. Took 1 for deload/PR.

Weight: 152 (still on cut, but added more fat in diet)

Squat: 275 &gt; 295

Bench: 225 &gt; 225x3

Deadlift: 325 &gt; 355

Press: 135 &gt; 145

Total: 885lbs

**3rd Cycle**

In progress... Currently in 2nd week.

Squat/Bench routine remains the same with slight tier 2 variations depending on mood.
Still feel like my deadlift is really weak. I'm focusing on increasing deadlifts by alternating heavy rack pulls, mid-pause deadlifts, deficit deads, and speed deads for tier 2 work. Joints randomly hurt but not as much as before.

**Lesson/Tips**

* don't program your lifts too heavy (especially if you are new to this volume/weight)
* heavy 2nd tier work really helped (3x10,3x8,3x5,2x10)
* listen to your body and change things around. if something didn't work, reprogram it using GZCL as the framework.

Because of that, I've put off writing this for a few days, but it's time to stop stalling and move on.  For those not wishing to read about my Jimmies being rustled, I went 4/9 on the day:

Squat: 408/185, 463/210(X), 463/210(X)

Bench: 220/100, 254/115, 265/120(X)

Total: 1146/520

Bw: 148.0/67.2

Wilks: 402.689


Before delving into the negatives, maybe there's something to say about having an absolutely terrible day and still hitting a 5kg total PR from April and moving up to #14 on PL Watch.  Realizing you missed your gym total by about 100 lbs pretty much shits on that parade though.  Just hitting what I should have been capable of would have been good enough for #7 and just 5 lbs more than that would have equated to being #5 in the country.  Goddamn, talk about a disappointment.  


**Training**


Having ran three Smolov base cycles between October and April, I was fairly well sick of high rep squatting.  It's also worth noting I hadn't done any sort of benching in months, as my failed 226 lb bench press fail from April will attest too, and I realized it was probably time to start doing something about that despite hatting bench.  My approach from then until now is what some people might consider unconventional.  


With the exception of a couple banded speed squat sessions with the typical Westside template (I'd eventually drop these all together), I didn't do one set on squats that wasn't a single or 85% or greater. Not one.  Ever.  A typical squat day was 10-25 sets of 1 rep with as little rest as possible.  Sets were dependent on how close to my 1RM I was or just how I felt that day.  Usually I'd just keep doing a certain weight until they started to turn to grinders and then I'd stop.  That was a typical squat day.  A typical squat day also happened to be every day (except for four days out of three months when I did some max effort deadlifts).  This sort of sucked at first, but my body adapted to it soon enough and then my work capacity for squats really took off.  My form was solid, speed was excellent, and strength was going up at incredible rate.  I attribute that to just focusing on only doing one rep at a time, not thinking about how you'll grind out the subsequent reps.  Even on 95% singles, my PL team members commented the bar speed was considerably faster than it had been on the first few reps of the 4x9 days of Smolov.  Interestingly enough, all of the days I felt like maxing out again on squats, and deadlifts for that matter had been days I'd done at least 20 singles.  Without any rhyme or reason, I milked this for all it was worth and ended up with a 455 beltless squat a few weeks before nationals and then a 460 belted squat two weeks out.


In regards to bench, there was really no place else to go but up.  Doing something was inevitably going to be better than doing the nothing I had been doing (maybe not ""nothing"", I guess I did dips somewhat frequently).  If high volume squatting was working so well, I figured ""What the hell?  Let's try this for bench too.""  In reality, I didn't do all that much flat benching besides some banded speed benching.  The bulk of my pressing was strict OHP and paused benching on a low incline bench to ease up on the shoulders a little bit.  I started pressing almost every day, switching between OHP and inlcine, just like I would with squats.  The rep, sets, and intensities were pretty much the same: no less than 85% of 1RM, no more than five reps per set, and between 5-15 sets depending on how I felt that day.  Above all though, I made sure everything was strict and paused.  Off the chest used to be my weakest part of the the press, but now it's actually turned into a fairly strong part of my press.
To balance out all the pressing I tried to do some sort of pulling every day: rows of any variation, shrugs, pull ups, face pulls, OH squats, external rotation stuff, etc and work on shoulder mobility.  


During this time, deadlift training was almost entirely dependent on my squats, but I did from time to time pull heavy to chart my progress and also to work on my hook grip with either static holds or deads themselves.  At my final testing day, I pulled a solid 520 and pulled 550 to my knees before it stalled.  


**Diet, Making Weight, Fiasco**


After my last meet, my diet became what one would call ""lax"" for about three weeks.  After being Paleo for the better part of a year and a half, anything in the dining hall was fair game and I swelled up to about 165, most likely from water retention due to salt and carbs.  Eating ice cream, brownies, and doughnuts three times a day may sound like fun, but in reality it was miserable, always lethargic and bloated.  With the closure of the dining halls, I cleaned up my diet considerably and went back to Paleo.  Being an under-employed student paying rent in a college town, my food budget wasn't exactly unlimited.  At $.59/lb, $6.25/five dozen, and $2/5 lb bag, chicken hindquarters, eggs, and potatoes were the bulk of my diet.  An average day was usually two pounds of chicken and a couple of potatoes after lifting and then half a dozen eggs, more potatoes, and some sausage, if it was on sale, cooked up in a frying pan before bed.  There were some assorted vegetables in there and a cup of heavy cream or half &amp; half for extra fat with each meal.  It was basically carb backloading coupled with IF and it served me well.  


The strength gains came along nicely in the gym and I stayed around a lean 160.  This was slightly heavier than I was last time a week out from weigh ins, but the cut was still manageable.  The Monday before the meet I eliminated sodium and carbs from my diet and got down down to 152 or so Friday morning after starting a 24 hour fast Thursday night.  A few five minute rounds in the steam room and I was down to 151 by noon.  Before departing for Des Moines at 5:00 I was 149.0 after a hot shower and going to the bathroom (not easy when you haven't drank anything in 16 hours).  At the 7:00 weigh in I was 148.0 and then started chugging salted Gatorade and eating beef jerky and potato chips to start a sodium/carb bloat.  


Post weigh in dinner was the usual BBQ feast: lots of ribs, smoked meat, and potato salad.  Without meaning to brag, I can put away a fair share of meat, my best effort was probably a three-and-a-quarter pound beef roast over the course of an hour or so.  For whatever reason though, I left the restaurant feeling absolutely miserable.  Walking to the car was terrible and I thought for sure I was going to lose all of my precious gains.  Thankfully I made it back to my parents house but when I tried drinking a glass of water, it immediately came back up along with some meat.  Not taking the hint, I tried to drink water again because I was still dehydrated and throwing up probably did not help with that matter.  This time even more came up after I got that feeling you get when you know you've drank too much and now you're fucked because you know you're going to throw up everywhere.  After that I called it quits, rolled up a towel to use as a pillow and slept in the bathroom until about midnight.  I woke up not covered in vomit, thankfully, thought about trying to drink water again, decided against it, and then finally got into my own bed, and slept until about 6:45.  


Upon waking, I felt slightly better but still had a slight headache from dehydration and had a few eggs, blueberries and Gatorade for breakfast.  Before leaving I weighed myself one last time at 163.  Despite throwing up twice, it was still a 15 lb weight gain.  notbad.jpg",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,vpm1,True,t3_wq9b9,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/wq9b9/meet_report_nasa_grand_nationals_41412/,

Hey guys, I'm the creator of one of the more popular [5/3/1 spreadsheets](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/o8ry2/jim_wendlers_531_spreadsheet_by_poteto_update/). It was released to the public in January 2012, and today it has over 13,000 downloads. No idea how it spread so much, but I'm glad so many have enjoyed using it.

I've received many e-mails over the past few months asking about customization and other nice features, and rather than just release another spreadsheet, I'm building a website that will replace the spreadsheet, and will also let you use other programs (e.g. Starting Strength, SL5X5, Madcow etc), among some other nice features I have lined up.

My vision for StrongJournal is for it to be a no nonsense site where you can get the proper stats about your strength progress and keep improving, and I hope it stands out from the other ""fun"" fitness sites like Fitocracy.

Please let me know your thoughts - if it's shit or if it's gold, let me have it. If you have any suggestions, please send me an email: jon at strongjournal.com or leave a comment on this post.

Thanks!

2. Can I customize the templates or make my own?
&gt; Yes, absolutely

3. Aren't you ripping off Jim Wendler, Medhi and the other authors of the program?
&gt; I'll be contacting the authors to work out an arrangement with them. If that doesn't work, I'll still be making sure they get compensated for the work they've done. For example, some templates will be limited in functionality unless you enter a password, which will be a word from a specific page in the book. This ensures that the authors get paid for their work, and you understand what you're getting out of the template.

As a practical example, is there a visual difference between a bodybuilder with same muscle volume and proportions and an Olympic lifter with the same muscle volume and proportions? This is assuming all else is equal, fat volume, height, body types etc. Would you be able to tell which is the bodybuilder and which is the Oly lifter simply from looking at the muscle?

If sarcoplasmic hypertrophy was true, it would imply a difference in muscle density (proteins should have a higher density than sarcoplasmic fluid), which should definitely be noticeable in some manner.

1364080400.0,50,self.weightroom,1avuxq,[Meet Report] USPA Texas State Championship - 1078lbs @ 170lbs - Raw - 342 Wilks,t333b,64,14,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1avuxq/meet_report_uspa_texas_state_championship_1078lbs/,"Today was a good day. Wound up with a 20lb squat PR and a 45lb deadlift PR. Bench was the same as my last meet, which is fucking terrible. I've been battling unruly shoulders for the last couple months and just recently got them to cooperate. I have no doubt that I'll be hitting PRs in all 3 at my next meet (as long as nothing horrible happens before then /hubrischeck). 

Here's the important stuff: 

**Squat**- I didn't have my camera slave present to film this, but here are my attempts. No knee sleeves, btw. They seem to get me outta my groove.

1. 150 kg / 330 lbs [2 reds, 1 white - inadequate knee lockout at top]
1. 160 kg / 352 lbs [3 whites]
1. 170 kg / 374 lbs [3 whites]

**Bench**- No video. 

1. 105 kg / 231 lbs [3 whites]
1. 115 kg / 253 lbs [3 whites]
1. 120 kg / 264 lbs [3 whites]

**Deadlift** - Yes. [Vididleo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6i2Esj7h-o). This shit was too easy. I think I probably had another 20 lbs in me. 

1. 175 kg / 385 lbs [3 whites]
1. 187.5 kg / 412 lbs [3 whites]
1. 205 kg / 451 lbs [3 whites]

**Meet Prep**

I didn't do much in terms of making weight. I'm working my way up to the top end of the 82.5 kg / 181 lb weight class, so I wasn't worried about cutting a ton of weight. I did drop around 5 pounds in the 2-3 days prior to the meet, just to benefit my Wilks. It required minimal effort, and I don't think it had much, if any negative impact on my total. 

**Recent Training** 

Since my last meet and more so in the last 2 months, I've taken on a higher frequency approach. It's actually outlined in this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1alrkr/for_those_of_you_who_trainlift_more_than_5_or_6/c8yohjx). Take a look if you're interested. Don't be fooled by the lack of full deadlifts. I still pull every 2-3 weeks, usually a few sets of 3 at 80-90%. What I'm doing seems to be working, and it's pretty maintainable. I'll keep it up until a change becomes necessary. 

**Post-meet Thoughts**

Omg that shit was so cash. Especially that deadlift. If I play my cards right, I'll be hitting 500 in no time, which I know is nothing to shake a stick at really, but fuck me I'll actually be pretty proud of it if/when I get there. Next meet may be in July, so we'll see what happens there. For now, I'll be content training often and slowly moving my way up the bodyweight ladder until I can hit a not-fat 181 pounds.

Note, I'm not talking a ""healthy"" diet either, or not per se, I mean if you have stories of breaking the squat WR on veggies/lean meats/nuts/brown rice then of course please share but this won't be a ""health"" discussion. We're talking what sort of eating plan has you smashing PRs and breaking hearts week in week out.

The idea to discuss this is that I've recently started carb backloading (well I already was in a way, I didn't even know I was though) properly by actually keto'ing it up to post workout. My schedule allows me to train at Kiefer's optimal time of 4-5PM so I figured ""why not?""
It's...interesting. I have been training better and getting leaner even though I regularly eat Smacks, Pop Tarts, cookies and donuts which is always nice. The first half of the day gets a bit tiresome sometimes but luckily I'm a huge coffee and diet Coke drinker (plus boiled eggs and chicken wings keep me well fed). I will say that it doesn't work as well with morning workouts, I have one morning workout and it usually sucks ass (luckily it's a light one).

I know people are inevitably gonna come in and say the ""see-food"" diet is best for PR smashing goodness but I usually just feel like ass doing that. I had a period around the Holidays where I was just eating whatever the fuck came by, now due to my training volume and my side job I stayed lean but I didn't perform well.

Had to cut down from 77 kg for this (not an amount worth bitching about, I know). Weighed in initially at 75.3 kg. Ten minutes later I was down to 75. Thank fuck. If it matters to anybody, I'm 5'9"". I'll be moving up to the 82.5 kg weight class over the course of the next year. Maybe I'll look like I actually lift, and hopefully that extra size will give me a greater capacity for strength gains. 

Without further adieu, here's the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-C35qiBFAUg

and here are my attempts in text form:

**Squat**

1. (not filmed) - 150 kg - 2 whites, 1 red (didn't lock out my knees quite enough before the descent)
1. 160 kg - 3 whites
1. 170 kg - 3 reds - just didn't have it in me

**Bench**

1. 105 kg - 3 whites
1. 110 kg - 3 whites
1. 115 kg - 3 whites - I should have gone for a bit more on my second and third attempts. It all went up pretty easy

**Deadlift**
 
1. 185 kg - 3 whites - Gave this everything I had. So dizzy after all was said and done. I knew I wouldn't be hitting my next 2 attempts
1. (not filmed) - 187.5 kg - 3 reds - barely got it off the floor
1. (not filmed) - 187.5 kg - 3 reds - same deal

**Thoughts**

Great first meet experience. Probably won't compete in another until I reach the 82.5 kg weight class and have numbers that are somewhat competitive. Don't have much else to add. Honestly, I'm still pretty tired from the whole thing. I didn't expect it to be such big meet, but there wound up being more than 150 lifters there. From weigh-in to my last deadlift attempt, I was there for a full 10 hours... so I didn't stick around to see how I placed. Hopefully the results are up in the next few days and I can see how I fared against all the other 75 kg dudes. 

edit - 

**Training History**

Training history has a long and short version. Long is that I trained consistently for 2 years after high school, then didn't lift at all for over a year. As you can imagine, I got pretty laughably weak. 

I started back again last September, and have been consistent ever since. Not exactly sure why I stopped in the past, but I was doing a lot more drugs back then and making worse choices in general, so I think that had something to do with it. I started with a little program I built myself with the knowledge I'd retained from when I trained before. Actually made some progress, then switched to 5/3/1 for a time, made a little progress, then moved on to another program I made based on some westside stuff. Sound ridiculous yet? It kind of is. I would've likely been better off sticking with starting strength when I first started... oh well. 

The last few months I've been following a program I made myself. I like it. A lot. Plan on sticking with it for quite awhile, and I see it being effective. It starts on Monday of each week and looks like this: 

* Day 1 - Squat (work up to a heavy single at ~90% 1RM, AMRAP at a specified percentage, 3-5 sets of 1-4 reps at the AMRAP percentage)
* Day 2 - Bench (work up to a heavy single at ~90% 1RM, AMRAP at a specified percentage, 3-5x1-4 at the AMRAP percentage)
* Repeat until Friday or Saturday using the same percentages. Rest for 1-2 days, and start again on Monday. 
* Always squatting 3x per week. Benching 2-3x per week depending on if I train Saturday or not.
* Percentages are changed weekly in one of two ways (75,80,85,90) or (75,85,80,90). 
* The 3-5 sets of 1-4 that follow the AMRAP sets change according to the AMRAP percentage used. On 75% days, I do 3-5x4 at 75%. On 80% days I do at 3-5x3 at 80%. 85% days at 3-5x2 at 85%, and 90% days at 3-5x1 at 90%.
* Accessory work isn't listed up there, but it definitely exists. There is some kind of back/shrug work every training sessions. Extra posterior chain work on squat days, ab training, and some kind of curl if I'm feeling up to it. On bench days I add in some kind of overhead pressing and some tricep isolation work. I aim for 1-3 sets of 8-16 reps on most accessory exercises. Rowing movements are usually done for 1-2 big sets of 16-30. Shrugging movements for 3-5 sets of 3-5.

Hi Everyone,

I created a 5/3/1/ Spreadsheet about 2 weeks ago with a ""Rep Goal"" feature that most people thought was pretty neat. However, I know not everyone needs this or finds this necessary. This update provides features that I am sure you will all love!

P.s. Download link on bottom for those who wants to skip the scary block of text.

**3/5/1 For Powerlifters Templates**

- Templates for those who wants to do the 3/5/1 Variations
- Inclusion of Singles

**Progress Tracker**

- The Progress Tracker is 100% synced with your latest workout numbers. Just enter the number of reps done and the estimated 1RM will be automatically graphed and logged.
- It requires absolutely no work on your part to maintain. Even if you miss a week, the graph and tracker will be adjusted to correctly reflect this!
- Furthermore, your highest 1RM to date is always displayed on top of the sheet and of course, is done automatically for you.
- The only thing that you need to do is enter the number of reps done in the main worksheet!

**Stall Feature**

- What really sets this 5/3/1 Worksheet apart from the every other weekly workout sheet is the Stall Adjustment. As much as we all want never ending progress, there comes a time when we have to readjust or lower the weight. In the past, this can only be done by readjusting your entire workout logs, erasing your past progress, and what if you have to reset more than once? 

- This is what the Stall Adjustment is for. Not only will you be able to choose which exercise to reset, but also by how much. This is all done without adjusting the numbers from previous weeks or cycles. Furthermore, all of the weights in successive weeks will be properly adjusted to reflect the amount. You can reset as many times as necessary and everything will always be correctly adjusted. This includes the Progress Tracker! The inclusion of this in conjunction with 1 Year worth of Log means a LOT of training before you have to start from scratch!

- To use this feature, simply type any words or letter into the Stall Box next to the appropriate exercise and enter the amount of weight to back off. Your weights for the NEXT cycle will be appropriately adjusted. Weights for the current cycle will remain unchanged. 

**Rep Goals**

- Full Explanation in Spreadsheet. 
- For 3/5/1 Powerlifting, the rep goals are only in effect for weeks 1 and 3. Week 3's rep goals are calculated based on week 1's estimated 1RM	

- ""As the weights get higher, it may become necessary to adjust the +5lbs to a higher amount to get a more accurate estimate. You may notice that the rep goal for the next week may give the same 1RM or even a lower 1RM. 
This is when you should modify the rep goal feature in the Start-Options page.""	

Disclaimer: The rep goal is for you to play around with and is by no means trying to detract from the idea of 5/3/1. If you don't like it, by all means, ignore it!	

**Other Features**

- Increment Per Cycle:
From cycle to cycle, the working 1RMs for Squats and Deadlift will be increased by 10lbs and Press and Bench by 5lbs.
You do have the option of changing this to your own preference by editing the cycle increment.

- Estimators:
The 1RM Calculator gives you a rough 1RM based on the amount of weight done for x number of reps
The Rep Goal Calculator tells you how many reps you need to do with a certain amount of weight to achive a certain 1RM
The Weight Calculator tells you the how much weight you need to do for a certain number of reps to achieve a certain 1RM
The Estimators are based on Matt Brzycki's (36*weight)/(37-reps done)

- **Supports KG, Pounds, and Microloading (new in V2.1!)**

- **Ability to change exercise order (new in V2.1!)**

- Contains 1 YEAR (52 week) of training log

* 28 years old
* &lt;77kg @ 170cm (&lt;169lbs at 5'7"") (weighed in at 75.95kg)
* Olympic Weightlifting for about 9 months, December 2010 I was 110kg bw, lost a load of weight and started lifting last summer.

**Lifts**

Snatch

*  [1] 80kg - good lift
* [2] ~~83kg~~ - miss
* [3] ~~83kg~~ - miss

Clean + Jerk

* [1] 93kg - good lift
* [2] ~~95kg~~ - bad lift
* [3] ~~95kg~~ - bad lift

**The Meet**

This was my first ever meet, but nonetheless I was expecting more from myself, than I actually managed to achieve.

I'd wanted to make a 195kg total (I've made 85+97.5 in practice before, was hoping for 90+105), my inexperienced meant I got excited and didn't focus enough on my following lifts, next time I need to stay more focussed and give myself more time on the platform and not rush into the lift.

My coach was unable to make the meet for family reasons, so one of the other lifters from my club stepped in, who did a great job. It was just weird taking cues off someone who hadn't really seen me lift before, there's probably something in there I need to remember to help me in future situations.

**Meet Prep**

I didn't really have to think much, other than lowering my bodyweight to get back into the 77kg category. I was 80kg two weeks out, and simply water cycled starting a week out (thanks for the tip shortkid), I made 75.95kg this morning, without really having to try too hard.

As for training, I just followed the club schedule, which was mostly conditioning style work to try and get us ready for what would be a heavy day. Our gym is pretty laid back normally, so I think coach wanted to get us working harder and be more focussed to get our game faces on ready for the meet.

**Future notes for myself**

* Making weight isn't hard, don't sweat it (well maybe a little ;) )and get stressed, two weeks was plenty to get from 79-&gt;75.95
* Take even more powerade and red bull, I had nearly finished all my liquid before the cj session
* Take even more food, I was starving after my group had finished lifting
* Rush less, 1 minute is a very long time to lift, set myself and get myself in the right frame of mind, I'm convinced that's why I wasn't committed enough on my second and third lifts and as a result missed.
* Competing is hellu fun, and a great social event too when your club teammates are there too!
* probably more to note as I go over my videos later on, once they've been uploaded (will link here too once that's been done)

* 5'9"". 197.3 lbs., 25 years old
* Been training for powerlifting since May of 2011, using a basic Starting Strength template.
* This is my third USAPL meet.

**Meet Prep**

The night before the meet, I drove three hours to Kalamazoo, MI and decided to stay in a hotel, instead of getting up early and driving Saturday morning.  This is a fantastic idea, and I highly recommend it.

I didn't have to worry too much about cutting to get to 198, but I made sure that in the morning, I skipped breakfast before weighing in.

**Lifts**

**[Video Recap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqvvfbQ475Q&amp;feature=youtu.be)** - Took video using a tripod on my own, so not an ideal setup, but worked pretty effectively.

Went 9 for 9 with all whites for all lifts.

* **Squat**
* 335 lb.
* 375 lb.  (Feet were in too close on this one, but still got the lift)
* 405 lb.

* **Bench**
* 215 lb.
* 255 lb.  (Tweaked my back on this one, but I was able to manage for the rest of the meet)
* 275 lb.

* **Deadlift**
* 365 lb.
* 405 lb.
* 425 lb.

**Outcome**

I ended up with a **total of 1105 lb.** and placed 2nd in the 198 Open Raw class.

**Thoughts**

* I definitely recommend getting a hotel or a room and staying there the night before if the venue is more than an hour away.  It's a great way to make sure you don't run into any hassle on meet day, and a great way to put yourself in competition mode.
* I was probably the only lifter in the meet that was completely on his own and without a team (Grand Rapids Barbell and the Kzoo HZ varsity team was there).  It definitely helps to have that support from a team, and I'll be looking for a team in my area in the future.
* Beef jerky is a great meet food.
* Having a good meet is a great way to go out and celebrate St. Patty's day!",,False,,t5_2ssmu,True,,,True,t3_r2x0r,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/r2x0r/meet_report_usapl_mi_hs_state_championships/,

1368532944.0,46,self.weightroom,1eb55k,"[Meet Report] Hokkaido Powerlifting Championship - Tomakomai, Hokkaido, Japan (515kg @ 101.8kg | Wilks - 311.266 - Open class",Lodekim,60,14,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1eb55k/meet_report_hokkaido_powerlifting_championship/,"So TL;DR at the top.  515kg at 101.8kg body weight.  175kg squat, 130kg bench, 210kg deadlift.  [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vMiqv3M5V4&amp;feature=youtu.be)

**Background:**

The basics: I'm 27, male, 6 feet (182cm) tall, and I weighed in at 101.8kg, thus competing in the 105kg class.  I was fat with some (not much) strength from not being totally inactive until 2010, lost weight living abroad (250lbs down to 190) started working out on weight machines in June of 2011, touched a barbell for the first time at the end of October 2011.  Started on Stronglifts and dicked around a bit after that, getting to a 325lb squat, 235lb bench, and 405lb deadlift in July of 2012.  Moved to Japan at the end of July, and since I wasn't able to be
consistent enough for most programs I've played around with a few different philosophies and programmed for myself.  Not as effective as a program, but not bad.  I totaled 445kg at 91.2kg body weight in November of 2012 on a 155kg squat, 115kg bench, and 175kg deadlift.  I slipped on my second deadlift attempt and probably called it a bit too high, so it should have been at least a little higher.

After that meet I went on a bulk and wasn't careful enough, got to heavy, and struggled to get back on a diet, that's why I competed in the 105 class as a fatty.  My diet was generally lots of meat, as many vegetables as I could get into my food, and then I ate junk, carbs, fried chicken, and stuff like that on the fatty bulk.  As CNP said, when you're already making concessions in your diet you tend to make them in the gym too, and I did.  What a shitty bulk.

Training: I tried a few things in the past 6 months.  The 2 main forms were building up to a few training near maxes, followed by some triples, then volume sets.  This worked okay, but progression was kind of stupid.  It helped me figure out what I could do, but probably didn't build much. CNP style singles and triples were useful some places, not so much others.  I tried to build my deadlift by not deadlifting because I was pissed off at my inconsistency at the last meet, bringing it back with a few different methods about 2 months out, and it actually worked okay.  My gym PR before the November meet was 190, and I didn't even pull 190 a single time before 2 weeks out from this last meet.  I'll detail what I think worked and what I'm trying going forward at the end for a ""going forward"" section.



**Meet Prep:**

I cut weight for my first meet, which was dumb, but I was 95kg and I wasn't going to be the only 105 and 10kg under.  This time I was over 100 so I went for 105.  There ended up being one other guy in that class for the full meet.  I didn't cut weight, but to get a higher Wilks I didn't do much for breakfast the day of.

I planned to hit my openers and second attempts on Tuesday, almost a week before the meet.  All of my second attempts were weights that I had hit pretty easily before in the gym, I just wanted to see if I could do them in the same day.  However, I completely forgot how to squat that day, loaded the bar too high on my back, and dive bombed it, so I hit my opener twice, the first was high, the second was a grinder, and I was pissed. I had been shitty at working on hip mobility and it was showing.  I hit a few lower weight singles to try to remember how to squat. I hit the bench opener and second attempt easily and said fuck it on the deadlift and went home.  I worked on my hips a little every day after that to get them ready, and it worked pretty well.  Thanks Kelly Starret for having good hip mobility drills that I could use.

On Thursday I went in to do some light practice, 5 singles of each lift, 120kg on the squat, 100kg on the bench, and 140kg on the dead.  All easy.

Thursday night my throat started getting sore, and Friday and Saturday I had a bit of a cough.  I started worrying that I was getting sick which would of course fuck me up, but it wasn't too bad.  My throat still isn't 100%, but I think it was allergies more than being sick. My sleep wasn't as good as I would have liked, but it was apparently good enough.


**The lifts:**

There were 2 flights of full meet lifters and 2 more flights of bench only, so I had a lot of down time.  I was in the second flight, so I got to see some of the judging before having to warm up.  Warm ups were in another room, with pretty shitty racks, but I did fine.  Built up to a single squat at 150kg about 10 minutes before my flight started. Bench I built up to a 110 single, and DL a 180 single.


Squat:
1st attempt - 160kg - 3 whites, really easy.  I was nervous about this at first because I thought I had a cold, I was worried about depth, and it was my first attempt.  People say open with something you can triple, and I have never tried doing a triple at 160kg.  I do however do 15 singles with 155kg in like 25 minutes.  I debated going lower, but I wanted to feel comfortable with my second attempt and not have to make a huge jump.  When 150kg was easy in warm ups I knew I could hit this, and wow, it was easy.

2nd attempt - 170kg - 3 whites, easy.  This tied my gym PR and it was easy.  All the hip mobility I had done helped, I was going plenty deep enough and was strong out of the hole.  I was worried before that I wouldn't be able to break my gym PR, but I had an attempt left to try it.

3rd attempt - 175kg - 3 whites, 5kg PR, 20kg meet PR, not so easy.  I got pumped up as much as I could before this lift, dropped down, came back up, and had to scream through the sticking point.  I might have had 177.5 in me but maybe not, and 180 I don't think would have gone up. I'm very happy with this.


Bench:
Bench is probably my most consistent lift, and I got lucky on the judge.  The head judge for my flight seemed to be calling the press command just a little bit faster than the previous judges.

1st attempt - 115kg - 3 whites, really easy.  No concern on this one, I do 115kg for 15 singles with a long pause in the gym.  If this didn't go up I should have just gone home.

2nd attempt - 125kg - 3 whites, easy.  Gym PR, and I've hit it for 2 singles with only a few minutes rest before, no problem.

3rd attempt - 130kg - 2 whites, 1 red (left ass cheek moved), 5kg PR, 15kg meet PR, interesting lift.  I had failed 127.5kg in the gym with my gym owner calling the commands, so I wasn't 100% sure I could do this, but 125 was pretty easy.  I wish the video had the whole lift, but my girlfriend's camera ran out of memory in the middle.  Interesting because I realized my lockout is apparently really strong.  Fast off the chest, but there was a grind through the sticking point.  Once I got through that though the bar just shot through to lockout.  I remember being surprised how fast I finished the lift.  Really happy with this one.


Deadlift:
When I deadlift after squatting heavy it's always pretty bad, and I struggled with form a lot when I first got it back into my routine, but I felt confident I could hit my opener with all the rest I had and how I was feeling that day.

1st attempt - 190kg - 3 whites, pretty easy. First time I've pulled 190 after squatting the same day.  A lot of pressure in my head at the top, but no real risk of missing it.

2nd attempt - 200kg - 3 whites, no problem. I probably could have made a bigger jump in the second attempt and tried for a PR on the third, but I really wanted a 500kg total, so I played it conservative and went for 200.  It went up easy and I had my 500 total.

3rd attempt - 210kg - 3 whites, that's basically the closest I've ever come to struggling at lockout, but it wasn't too bad. Ties my gym PR which was on a deadlift only day.  Had the meet been in English I probably would have gone for 211, or 212.5 or whatever because there was another guy in the 105's with the same total as me, making the same sized jump as me, with a lower body weight.  If he pulled 200kg and I got 210 he would have won based on being lighter.  I was lucky and he didn't get it, I did, and this won me the 105 class (though the 74 and 82kg class winners both out totalled me I think, and I tied the 93kg class winner).

Total: 515kg.


**Meet results:**
So like I said, I won the 105kg class (2 competitors) by 10kg.  They awarded medals in some weird grouping (I don't speak enough Japanese to really figure it out) and I got a silver behind the only guy in the 120kg class who totalled 600 and I think had a higher wilks.  The other guy in my class had a higher wilks, but after some confusion they said since we were in the same weight class and I won the class I was
getting that silver.  I dunno.

I'm happy with 2 all time PRs and everything being a meet PR.  I think there's another competition in July that I probably won't bother with, and there should be one in the fall.  I'm aiming to get back to the 93kg class for the fall.  I'd rather lose in a competitive class than be fat just to win a non-competitive class (there are like no 105s in Japan).


**Going forward:**

So first, it's diet time.  I liked how CNP outlined the basic carb cycling he does.  I'm going to do 4-5 day keto runs, with a once a week PSMF if I can keep my head at that, and then allow myself to cheat a bit on the weekends.  I want to get to 93 but I also don't want to never get to do anything fun with friends.  I'm not strong enough for that sacrifice to be worth it.

On training, I think I've figured out some of what works for me, and I think I've got my form down better too.

For squatting, anything over 5 reps for me is just garbage.  My hand position has changed, I'm not focused, and the hard part is catching my breath more than moving the weight.  I'm going to keep to lower rep sets with heavy weight, and I'm going to get my high rep hypertrophy mostly from accessories.  I'll try to improve my high rep squatting, but I'm not going to fixate on it.

For bench, I absolutely need to have a mix.  Singles and triples at 85% and above are really the only way I can keep working on technique and really using leg drive.  On high rep stuff it's just not the same.  On the other hand, I can't progress much when I stay at low reps.  I'm going to take some cues from a guy who does more body building stuff at my gym that pressed 125kg at 82kg body weight and have a high rep day too. I'll probably mix it up with dumbbell presses (which I suck at for never really doing them) and straight bar for reps.

For the deadlift, not training it worked, but I think there are some weak points that would have been better if I had trained it.  However, it doesn't seem to make sense for me to go really heavy.  I just get gassed and form falls apart.  I really like pulling a lot of singles for the dead, so I'm gonna try that once a week or every other week or something at lower percentages than I do singles on the squat or bench.

Oh, and I'm gonna try going beltless for a bit.  I seem to make the best gains when I alternate between lifting with and without a belt.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1368569497.0,,,True,t3_1eb55k,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1eb55k/meet_report_hokkaido_powerlifting_championship/,

				March 10th, 2013


**Stats**-Height 6'1, 19 years old
	Weighed in at 197.9lbs, competed in 198s (90kg), daily weight is 210 lbs(95kg).  


Definitely felt weaker after doing a quick water cut and after drinking 64oz of prune juice along my best friends advice (Although thinking back, I think that was more for his entertainment than for my benefit.).Will not do that again soon. Id rather compete strong and heavy than feel dehydrated and drained. Will learn from it.     
 
**Results**  
Squat-  
	1st attempt- 305lbs (142kg), three whites, easy weight to get on the board  
	2nd attempt- 355lbs (161kg), three whites, a 15 lb PR  
	3rd attempt- ~~375lbs (170kg)~~, failed lift, started to stall out and judges 
				     called for a rack. I could have had it but it would have been a
				     grinded lift and very slow.
	

Bench, my weakest event  
	1st attempt - 225lbs(102kg), 3 whites.   
	2nd attempt - ~~250lbs(114kg)~~, failed, was hoping to match a training PR from two weeks 
				     prior,too slow going down and got stuck at the bottom  
	3rd attempt - ~~250lbs(114kg)~~, failed, went down smooth and quick, came up great but stalled at 
				     the height of my sticking spot, could have pushed it through, but judges called for a rack.   


Deadlift, my strongest and most comfortable event.No videos.  
	1st- 405lbs(184kg)- 3 whites  
	2nd- 455lbs(206kg)- 3 whites, Solid lift, 20 lb PR  
	3rd- ~~475lbs(211kg)~~- failed. Couldnt even get it off the ground.   


Total 
1035lbs(470kg),

**Overall**



Took first in my weight class, 3rd in the teen division. Happy with my squat and deadlift results, but there is always work to do. Need to work on bench consistency, got to work on that sticking point, form definitely needs some work as well.   Not bad for a first meet.  

I've been lifting for about seven months now, I was a swimmer for about ten years until the end of high school, and never really saw the inside of a gym. I picked up some dumbbells last March, at 5'10 and 138lbs, did mostly just bench and curls, the usual screw around stuff beginners do,but really got hooked around seven months ago.  


**Some Background**

I started seriously lifting in university,in September 2012, when I met my best friend and lifting partner, a former wrestler and high school weightlifter. He started to train me, and I improved quickly, soon able to match his best lifts. Granted, hes only 5'2 and barely 140 soaking wet, but it was an accomplishment to hit a 2 plate bench, 3 plate squat, and a 4 plate deadlift after only 5 months. 
	In January, we got kicked out of our school gym for being ""rough on the equipment"" and for ""disturbing other patrons""; we were doing deadlifts and power clean and jerks and I suspect they were just tired of hearing grunts and yells and the occasional loaded barbell being dropped to the ground. My friend and I decided to find our own gym.	We looked at Gold's , LA Fitness, 24hour Fitness and were totally turned off by some aspects of those gyms. The limited equipment, the ever-present ""No Deadlift"" rule, and the infamous 'Lunk Alarm' that I'm sure many of you are familiar with.... Anyways, we found a home.  


LionHeart Gym. Its a small gym, located in the back of a small printing business out in Pinellas County FL, and its the best gym around. It feels like it was pulled off the set of the Rocky movies, with low lighting, chalk covered concrete and carpeted floors, and an old-man ball sweat odor permeating the place. Its AMAZING. There are tons of iron plates, a squat rack, power cage, and 2 competition benches. Its usually empty of people, and the owner couldn't give a damn if weights are dropped or thrown around or if yelling occurs. Hell, he often contributes to the noise on bench day.  

 On our first day, we met three of his patrons, up and coming 308er Morgan Mann, (whom I shadow), and world record benchers Joey Scalzo (who my friend shadows) and Leon Barry, who are all training for the Europa Expo in Orlando in 6 weeks. They  welcomed us into their workout with open arms, and we have been training with them ever since. They have been a great influence and their expertise and support has been great in preparation for this meet. I have the utmost gratitude for those guys, for helping us train and for driving with us to the competition, where they helped with equipment and technique and inspiration. They really are the best. 

**Training**  
This meet wasn't really planned for. Our first day at LionHeart, we heard it mentioned during our first workout and decided to just go for it. We had roughly seven weeks to prepare, so we followed a tapering workout that looked liked this:


Monday-Squat and speed deadlift  
Wednesday- Speed Bench and Upper Back  
Friday- Deadlift  
Sunday- Bench  


6 weeks out - Triples to max  
4,5 weeks out- Doubles to Max  
3 weeks out, Singles to max  
2 weeks out, Up to opening lift  
Last week, rest.  


**Diet**  
Ate pretty healthy, mostly university cafeteria food supplemented by eggs, chicken and milk, occasional 50 nugget bucket from Wendy's, triweekly trips to Chipotle and all you can eat wings at Winghouse every monday. Okay, perhaps not so healthy, but I tried to stay protein heavy but always ate my fruits and veggies. 

**Supplements**  
None. Multi and fish oil.   

**Future Training**
Bulking up to 220. Going to run Joey Scalzo's bench press routine ( a modified Russian routine shortened to 8 weeks) or do Smolov for squat. Not sure yet. Deadlifts should improve with squats.
My goal is to break the Florida state record as found [here](http://apa-wpa.com/APA%20Florida%20Mens%20Records.htm) by January 19th next year. Squat will have to improve from 355lbs(161kg) to 425lbs (193kg). Bench will have to go from &gt;225lbs(102kg) to 275lbs(125kg). Deadlift will have to go from 455lbs(206kg) to 550lbs(250kg). I know damn well that Im going to shatter it. 

Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated!

What I'm talking about is holding the bar against your shins, sitting way down, then coming up and pulling the bar. This isn't squatting the bar up, the bar doesn't leave the ground when you're sitting far back.

I tried it today and it was fantastic, the bar came off the floor much smoother, I highly recommend anyone weak off the floor gives it a go. I also found it easier and more natural to keep the bar against my shins and thighs as it came up. I put 7.5kg on my previous PR and it wasn't a strain.

My form, although not perfect always had a straight back and steady form. After a lot of research and active research I came to the conclusion, that it was not in fact issue with correct movement but, rather with not activating the correct muscles. 

I was neglecting to focus on my Glutes in my Dead lift and Squat. I was not focusing on my weaker muscles and other muscles were over compensating, this caused imbalance. 

This imbalance, while lifting, may not have been hugely damaging if only in effect while lifting, but they carried over to everyday life, and thus ensued years of bad conditioning and imbalance. 

I'm not a sport scientist, so most of my knowledge is anecdotal, but for those who suffer from pain or imbalance, there are simple triggering exercises out there which can help bring into consciousness inactive muscle sets. After a while of activating these dormant muscles while working my weights up, new pathways have developed and now function better within my lifts. 

For me it was my glutes that mainly needed attention. But just because your lift looks okay from that outside, does not mean that it's functioning correctly from the inside? 

This may all be ill-founded and wrong, but appears to make sense to me.

**Introduction**

Many of you may know me from my work as the Forum Admin over on Fitocracy. Little background on me as a lifter (more can be found [here](http://blog.fitocracy.com/post/15625232537/fitocracy-member-spotlight-lokkju )). Started lifting in January of last year, after a huge weight loss the year before. I hadn’t touched a barbell with any seriousness since 05 or so (high school). 


Quick run through will talk about each program a bit more in depth later in the post. Training started with four months of madcow, which saw some decent gains. 245/315/365 or so for my 5 rep maxes at the time if I remember correctly. Decided I’d exhausted my linear gains and started training on a push pull split with some guys from my gym. Spent a couple months doing that, before realizing that I was spinning my wheels on the injury bus. Started on 531 in late June, and ran for four cycles. Started Sheiko #29 in November,  #37 in December, and will finish my first cycle of #30 this week.

**Methodology**
Sheiko’s training methodology is similar to that of other eastern European trainers. Rather than max effort lifts weekly, and training other lifts to improve the big three, Sheiko trains his athletes with frequency and volume. In his training programs, an athlete will repeat the big three several times a week, and often twice in a lifting session. This helps to improve form, and drive growth. Weights (depending on the program) range from 60-95% of the training max on a given lift. The key premise is that the low weight and high volume will allow for better recovery.

The training is complex, and you will see remnants of several other programs throughout the various days. The base programs train three days a week. Athletes whose totals have reached CMS or MS levels will train an additional day each week. Keep in mind that the volume is intense, and even the simplest of the programs has 850-1000 reps in a given cycle. The base program #29 has 964 reps over the course of the four week program. #37 increases to 1093. 

**Templates**

There is a basic template to most of Sheiko’s 3 day programs:

Monday

- Bench/Squat

Wednesday

- Bench/Deadlift

Friday

- Bench/Squat

Week One

- medium, low, medium

Week Two

- medium, low, high

Week Three

- high, low, medium

Week Four

- medium, high, low

Mondays are always the heaviest squat day, and tend to be the volume bench day.

Wednesdays are the only deadlift days, and tend to be the heavy bench days

Fridays tend to be the volume squats, and the light bench days

Keep in mind when reading these that the Russians write their numbers reps x sets rather than sets x reps like we do.

**Personal Experience**

**29**

This was my introduction to what Sheiko is all about, and by all means should be the starting point for all lifters interesting in running the routines. This is the first of four, four-week mesocycles, and has the least volume of any of Sheiko's routines. There are 964 lifts (big three does not include accessory) in the program as written. Which can be quite the rude awakening for some that might not be used to the volume. However you'll benefit from working with lighter weights (85% is the peak for squats and bench, 90% on the last Wednesday for rack pulls).

For me this was a rough cycle. After three weeks off, and coming back from a knee injury the DOMs were murderous that first week. By the time I had finished that first week, I spent my weekend eating and sleeping.

Second week got better, and by the end of the mesocycle my form was drastically better on all three lifts.

**37**

Let me preface the discussion on this mesocycle by saying, that if you haven't ran through the Sheiko cycles before, move to 37 after 29. The cycles are similar, with only a slight increase in volume (intensity is about the same).

I actually ran this on a cut, and still saw pretty decent gains. The worst of the days your working up to 85% of your maxes. It was a rough run, but it was manageable. Starting weights were: 285/350/430

**30**

Imagine the most beat up you've ever felt after a mesocycle... that's what 30 was for me. I felt like I sold my soul to make it through this mesocycle... ever done 15+ sets of squats and 15+ sets of bench in the same day? You will on day one, and it's one of the easier days. 

The intensity and volume combination is brutal. Every day your working above 80% of your 1rm on each of the big three. While doing in the ball park of 10-15 sets of each lift. The assistance work also increases. Eat like a horse, take your creatine, and fish oil and do as much prehab as you can recover from. Most of the mesocycles have some degree of variation from day to day and week to week in intensity levels. This one really doesn't. I kept the same working weights as I had used on 37 just to be safe.

All that said before I moved onto 31 I was able to up my working weights to 300/375/450

**31**

I'm currently in the second week of 31. While the intensity is rougher, the volume is toned down, and there is considerably more diversity from day to day and each week than its predecessor. The purpose of this program is to prepare you for 32 (peaking cycle) while giving yourself a bit more recovery time. The volume has been toned down, but the peak weights stay relatively the same. 

**Conclusions** 

This style of training works for me. The volume, and repetition I find helps me to push myself more. Working in higher weight ranges allows for adaptation to the weight, and I find monthly progression easier than I did on 531 for whatever reason. If your like me, and don't have the set up to do deficit deadlifts and rack pulls, this program works nicely with Coan's deadlifting routine. I've seen some pretty solid jumps in PR's with the combination of the two programs. However others might struggle with the total volume.

I modify the programs by super-setting the flies with chin-ups, and spend some time on Saturdays doing some press, prehab, and rowing. Mainly because the program takes a huge toll on your shoulders. 

Overall the routines are interesting. They are just taxing enough that you feel exhausted for a day and a half, but you never come back into the gym feeling less than 80% (assuming food and rest), and by the following Monday you should be back to 95%. If you are at a high intermediate, advanced, or elite level I would definitely recommend the routines.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,True,,,True,t3_pdjec,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pdjec/sheiko_multicycle_review/,

I use mantras to help me lift. Buddha's a fat jolly bastard by all reports, so I think my approach is more useful.

There are two kinds of training mantras, in my view: cueing mantras and confidence mantras.

**Cueing Mantras**

Here's the cue mantra I was using today while snatching.

""Chest up, weight on the heels. Chest up, weight on the heels. Chest up, weight on the heels"".

I'd repeat it to myself walking to the bar, while setting up to lift, until I began the lift. I'd also consciously make sure I was arranged according to the mantra -- I didn't just repeat the cues, I would act them out.

You can do it in your head or out loud. Out loud works better, in my opinion; possibly because it leads to a double-processing of the mantra (first in generating speech, second it hearing your voice).

I used to fiddle with long mantras to cover all the bases -- ""Chest up, shoulders back, twist and release arms, tighten abs, deep breath"" and so on, but the problem is that by the end of the mantra you've forgotten how it began.

Plus, it breaks the old coaching rule that you should work on no more than two problems at a time, preferably the lowest hanging fruit. For me lately the problem has been dropping my chest during the snatch and for both lifts, having to keep the weight on my heels. Hence the short mantra I've been using lately.

**Confidence Mantras**

These are better known, thanks to the effort of Guru Coleman. ""Ain't nothin' but a peanut"" works for him. Not for me personally though.

A confidence mantra aims to still the fear that can cause you to abort or fail a lift. I have had mixed experiences with these. I tried a mantra for cleans and snatches: ""I am strong, I am fast, and the bar is light"". Unfortunately the mantra itself became an object of fear, so I dropped it.

On the other hand, I recently had a good experience using a mantra for my Smolov OHP effort. ""Light as a feather. Light as a feather. Light as a feather"". I'd even imagine pressing a feather in each hand. It seemed to work for almost every challenging set.

I'd be interested to see if anyone else has come up with some mantras of their own.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_nl41j,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/nl41j/on_the_use_of_mantras_in_training/,

Bodyweight of ~175 lb.

Program based of a conservative 1RM of 295 lb.

Earlier in January I began a Smolov Jr. cycle for weighted chins based on the success that I had on it with my plateaued bench press (230 -&gt; 245). My weighted chin had been fairly stagnant for a few months when I began.

Weeks one and two were followed almost exactly with the exception of an added rest day on week one. I encountered a couple of hiccups on week three which caused me to draw it out to two weeks. The first was that I had a powerlifting meet right in the middle. The second was that a few days after the meet, I got sick. The exact schedule I followed is shown below.

The sets/reps/weight were followed exactly, except for the very last day where I opted for an additional five pounds. No repetitions were missed. Each day I would weigh myself beforehand to figure out how much weight to add. Week two I added ten pounds and week three I added five on top of that.

I attempted to eat a small surplus during this program. I gained about 2-4 lb of scale weight although it is hard to tell how much of that is water.

Comments: Running this program on weighted chins was certainly a success. I haven't gained this much strength in such a short period of time on my chins ever, as far as I remember. The 3-plate chin felt fairly easy. I believe I could probably have done another 5lb or so.

The program was relatively easy. Even on the last day, when I went over what the program prescribed, I was in no danger of missing repetitions. This was likely due to the fact that at least for me, weighted chins have a different curve of strength compared to most other lifts such as the bench press. By this I mean that the percentage of my 5RM is closer to my 1RM on my chins compared to my other lifts.

Lastly, I hit the three-plate milestone with my chin today! In another couple of years I hope to hit four.

This was my first single ply meet and I blew it, plain and simple. However, I did learn a lot from the experience so I'll share that with you here. But first, an account of how the meet went.

Thursday morning I weighed 274.5. Friday morning I weighed in officially at 266.4 lbs. Within 2-3 hours, I was back up to 278. I stepped on the platform somewhere around 285. Turns out I'm really good at bloating up.

[**Squat**](http://youtu.be/aS99bS27XH4)

My squat suit, which was already too tight around the legs, took about 20 minutes to get on, which completely disrupted my warmup. I took 505 for a ride a couple times just to get the suit on all the way. It hurt a lot more than normal. 

First attempt: 606, a weight I've easily taken to depth in the gym stopped cold a couple inches above parallel. 3 reds.

Second attempt: 650 A little better. I hit depth, but I was incredibly unstable when my straps went slack partway up (my straps are like 4 inches too long, which you can see in the video when I unrack the bar) so I bobbled the weight and got 3 reds. 

Third attempt: 650 Botched my setup, first falling back, then resetting and losing the weight forward. 3 reds.

Thus I bombed out of my first single ply meet. It took my brother, byukid, a lifter my brother was coaching, and a power rack to get me out of my suit.

All was not lost, as I was able to convince the meet director to still let me deadlift as an unsanctioned lifter.

**Bench**

I didn't do anything here except help byukid warm up and lift off for him. If my squat suit was too tight to use, trying to use my shirt would have been a disaster and there's no point hurting myself at this point.

[**Deadlift**](http://youtu.be/vNAVgq5vFfw)

These were done raw, as pulling in my suit is a nightmare under the best circumstances. To give you an idea of how bloated I was, I couldn't get my belt off between sets, even with help.

First attempt: 606 I've tripled this weight before and pulled it while sick and dehydrated, so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. It wasn't. Matched previous meet PR. 3 whites.

Second attempt: 633 This would be an 8 lbs all time PR and a 27 lbs meet PR. Came up easier than the first. 3 whites.

Third attempt: 650 I didn't expect to actually get this, but with as easy as 633 was I figured it was doable. I couldn't really feel anything during this pull, but it appears to have worked out. Easily the best, most technically perfect pull I've ever done. 25 lbs all time PR and 45 lbs meet PR. 3 whites.

**Lessons Learned**

* Bloating works for raw stuff, but can be dangerous for equipped competition.

* If you're going to lift equipped, make sure your gear bloody fits. Squatting in a suit that's no better than over-tight briefs is not fun.

* I'd even go as far as to say avoid Titan gear for your first suit and shirt. Get a nice easy Inzer suit, learn to use it, then transition to the Titan stuff. Still make sure it fits, though.

* Being friends with meet directors and federation officials can't hurt.

* byukid's wife is real. She rules her sister-wives with an iron fist of congeniality.

* If you're going to train for an equipped meet, make sure you train for an equipped meet. My training was a disorganized mess, constantly switching back and forth between raw and equipped cycles, never balancing or finishing anything, and that contributed to constant pain and frustration. Have a good crew with experienced lifters to help you learn the gear. Only a couple of the guys I train with squat equipped, the rest being bench specialists, so I didn't learn the ropes there as well as I could have.

I don't know that there's a whole lot more to say. I need to clean up my diet and get my training organized. Now that I know I'll be starting PT school this summer, I should be able to put together a better plan for the next meet in May. 675 is probably in the cards. I also got invited to train with a professional strongman's crew (the only one in Utah) so I might be doing some strongman meets in the future as well.

This week's topic is:

&gt; Nutrition

* Nutrition - what you eat and supplement on a regular basis - is a very important part of success in training. Different lifters have a wide variety of nutrition ""programming"" in terms of how closely or loosely they track and control their diet.
* What kind of eating/supplementation regimen do you follow, and how has it helped you reach your goals?
* How have your eating habits changed with your training, and how did you find what works for you?
* Talk general nutrition as it relates to your lifting I guess. Carb backloading, carb frontloading, keto, carb/fat/protein alwaysloading, etc etc etc

Feel free to ask other training and programming related questions as well, as the topic is just a guide.

This was my first meet, as well. I have been lifting for about 13 months. I weighed in at 119 lbs and was in the 123 weightclass. I went 7 out of 9 in my lifts. There was no one competing against me in my division - RAW - 56 kg. I totaled 578.4 lbs.

[Squat #1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4kIojRv1g&amp;context=C3440278ADOEgsToPDskI8WlNrOe8FJ3_emSD-zCDT) - 176.2 lbs

Deadlift #3 - no lift 264 lbs

**Lessons**

1) I need to work on endurance. By the end of the bench, I was already worn out. I have hit 126 lbs in the gym plenty of times.  And then, I just had nothing left for the deads. I was beat.

2) I need to learn where parallel is. My first two squats were super deep. 

3) I should have attempted more for my 3rd squat. I would have had an easy PR at 203.7 lbs. 

4) I need to get a different singlet. The edges rubbed my legs to shit.

5) Use baby powder on your thighs before deads. Otherwise, you will tear your flesh off.

This meet was to test the waters. I played it pretty darn safe with all of my numbers. Next meet, with increased endurance, I will be looking to set some PRs. This was a great experience. I am so happy I went through with it and am already looking forward to the next one.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,True,,,True,t3_q8vmh,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/q8vmh/meet_report_washington_state_usapl_championships/,

**Meet Prep**  
So, about 4 months ago I decided to enter this meet. I was on my second or third cycle of 5/3/1 and changed to a more Westside approach to try and up my numbers a little bit. It went pretty well, except my deadlift. I finally got to film myself and figured out what was up with an [/r/weightroom](/r/weightroom) formcheck. My bench didn't go up, but I was also practicing the pause. Squat didn't go up, but it was now with wraps instead of sleeves and taking a lot more effort to focus on getting below parallel. My workout nutrition was a custom trueprotein mix and good old dextrose. Other than that, I focused a lot on very simple and effective accessory work- pendlay rows, zerchers, lots of ab work.

**The Drive**  
Friday my wife and I got up, loaded the car and hit the road. For breakfast I downed a protein shot with caffeine I had found (25 g pro/125 mg caffeine) and a few eggs and orange juice. We had funyuns, pork rinds, and cheez-its in the car for all purpose snacking. I had a couple of those tubes of protein for ease of use. Lunch was a few McD's burgers and lots of fries with extra salt. Also a protein shake. Dinner was more burgers and fries with a big salad. I think I salted the salad for good measure. The weather on the way there was generally good, but there was a stretch of about 75 miles in Nebraska where snow was sticking and I tapped the brakes just wrong- we spun sideways and into the median. Thankfully there was no one around us. We were a bit shook up, but after we got our heads together and back on the road, we proceeded slowly without incident. Got to the hotel, did lots of mobility stuff and downed a few tylenol pm.

**Meet Day**  
Got up early and downed a finibar and a ton of gatorade and another protein energy shot. Made our way to the meet. I got checked in and all my gear checked out, then weighed in- 149.9 kilos. Set my openers and then waited for instruction. They took a long time making flights because a lot of people missed weight and they had to do some re-arranging. I got put in flight H (the 8th one). They had two platforms going, and luckily I got on the one that didn't have issues. On the other platform they kept calling lifters out of order. That was no fun. Bill Sindelair was the organizer and he did do a great job of being involved and explaining things. There were a few hiccups, but this was the first meet they had run there, so given that it wasn't too bad. Lifting started an hour later than expected. I had a big protein shake (about 250 g protein) a couple finibars, a couple chicken sandwiches, a gatorade and a half, and some other food to keep me going.

**Squats**  
They were calling squats high left and right, so I knew I wanted to lower my opener- just by 5 kilos- to make sure I'd hit it with good depth. Warmups felt really good. Ran into Kenny Ruben- kid is insane! He opened with 711. He holds some records at 242.

[Squat 1](http://youtu.be/tc84gahXTU0)- 235 kilos, 3 whites  
[Squat 2](http://youtu.be/JFzo-9IewDU)- 250 kilos, 3 whites  
[Squat 3](http://youtu.be/kbbaGLALqGQ)- 270 kilos, 2 whites  

Overall, really pleased with squats, glad my depth was good. I felt like I should have made a bigger jump from 235- maybe done 235, 255 then 275. Ah well, it's only 10 lbs short of my PR. Also, on the second attempt the judge gave me the rack command with the squat signal- you can see my confusion. Third video my wife accidentally cut short.
  
**Bench**  
Bench warmups went okay. The pauses were way long and I would say about 3/4ths of the lifters missed at least one attempt at bench. Several people bombed out because of bench. It was tough to watch.

[Bench 1](http://youtu.be/Sfacw3YPmLI)- 145 kilos, 3 whites  
[Bench 2](http://youtu.be/0834KHmhMxk)- 160 kilos, 2 whites  
[Bench 3](http://youtu.be/E8WxWdOGgUM)- 170 kilos, no lift  
  
Kinda pissed about this- I was sure I'd have 170. Also, I just realized 160 kilos is 352 not 355, so my total was 1564. Ah well. 170 just disappointed me. Need to drill in form for this and make sure I can get the pause.

**Deadlifts**   
Deadlifts were pretty straightforward. I kept my warmup short and simple. I upped my opener because I knew I could get it. I didn't feel like I had blown my energy on squats, so I knew I could get a PR in deads.

[Deadlift 1](http://youtu.be/XIexDC89WQw)- 250 kilos, 3 whites    
[Deadlift 2](http://youtu.be/CisFCJNf2gI)- 280 kilos, 2 whites    
[Deadlift 3](http://youtu.be/4ehtnjXZj4s)- 290 kilos, no lift    

I tore open my hand on deadlift 2 (11 lb pr) and spent a lot of time looking for a bandaid. Then when I got to the platform and set up, the head judge hadn't given me the signal. So I waited. When he finally gave me the signal, the combination of things just came together, I got loose and went nowhere. Ah well. I know I could have had it if I hadn't let myself get distracted.  

**Post-Meet Analysis**  
So there were some computer issues and they couldn't sort out who did what in what divisions. I'll find that out later I guess. Just checking their results posted online there are a few anomalies, such as my name not being listed, nor Kenny Ruben. So we'll see- if I don't hear within the week I'll check in with Bill and see what's up. Went home, laid around, then went to Buffalo Wild Wings, downed a couple dozen wings and a few sides, then dozed off.

All in all, I feel really good about how things went. I have a few regrets, but they're definitely overwhelmed by how good I feel about everything. I don't think my numbers were really that impressive, but the meet was eye opening and really motivating. I want to do so much more now. 

Thanks to everyone in [/r/weightroom](/r/weightroom) who gave feedback on my formcheck, to everyone who gave me advice on what to bring and how to prep, and to kookiejar and her husband who were able to come out for the meet. Most especially thanks to my wife, who sat through the whole meet and the car rides there and back.

I’ve been training with Jacob Cloud (from 70sbig and Vintage Strong) since roughly last October.  I did a local meet last November and totalled 555 weighing 82.5 kilos, with an ugly squat, a mediocre bench (nursing some shoulder tendonitis), and a deadlift way below what I was capable of (thanks to my terrible attempt selection).  After that meet, I started training for Texas Strongest Man in March, and it wasn’t until spring that I really started to focus on powerlifting.  I’m built to deadlift more than squat, and rather than work on my weak points, I just kind of ignored squats and deadlifted a lot.  Jacob made me cut back on the pulling a bit, clean up my squat form, and get over the mental aspect of carrying a heavy medium weight on my back.  A month out from Nats, I was looking at roughly a 500 squat, 330 bench, and a 630 deadlift.  Before all this, I had done a couple of local strongman contests and had been training on my own for quite a while.  My goals for Nationals were to qualify for the Arnold and hopefully bring home some hardware.


**Meet Prep**

My last training day was the Monday before the meet.  Middleweight guys were scheduled to lift Saturday afternoon, so that gave me four days to rest up and drop somewhere between eight and ten pounds of water.  Easy.  I flew out to Orlando on Thursday afternoon, stopped eating and drinking around 8 on Friday night, and weighed in at 82.3 at noon on Saturday.  I drank a liter of grape Pedialyte and then went back up to our hotel room and started eating.  EVERYTHING.  I had four eggs, a huge bowl of protein pancakes, a banana, peanut butter, and a giant-sized coffee from the airport Starbucks, plus another two liters of water.  It was good.  Lots of salt on everything.  I rehydrated to the point where I was almost uncomfortable — Jacob told me to try to stay right at that edge of being overfull all day long.  I did a pretty good job of that, but honestly, the edge of uncomfortable ends up being pretty damn unpleasant after eight hours.  

Which is how long it took between weigh-ins and my third deadlift attempt.  There were so many competitors in the 83 and 93 kilo classes that weigh-ins alone forced the meet directors to push the start time back from 2 to 2:30.  I was in the third flight, and my first squat attempt ended up being over three hours after I weighed in.  Fortunately, warmups felt great.  Jacob had been going over mental cues with me all week, and it helped.  


**Squat** - *200/220/230, all made*

I worked up to an easy single at 185 kilos and buried my opener at 200, a 10 kilo PR over my best squat at the Longhorn.  I got my second with one red light for depth, but it felt easy — easy enough that I felt comfortable attempting my stretch goal of 507, which would be a lifetime raw PR for me.  I don’t really remember much about the lift itself, but I got three whites and after that I was rolling.


**Bench** - *135/140/145, all made*

There was a pretty long break between squat and bench.  I had another banana with peanut butter, another liter of Pedialyte (orange this time), and a much smaller cup of coffee.  Bench warmups felt fine.  Bench press is a pretty weak lift for me, and I hadn’t been able to stay injury-free for more than a month or so leading up to the meet, so there wasn’t a whole lot of warming up to be done anyway.  I took my last rep backstage at 125 kilos, and then hit an easy 135 for my first attempt.  My second attempt at 140 was a bit less aggressive and a bit slower.  Jacob took me aside afterward and told me that I needed to pick it up for the last attempt at 145.  I put on my headphones, zoned out for a good eight or so minutes, and ended up making 145.  It felt like the easiest lift of the day for me and by this time the adrenaline was driving everything.


**Deadlift** - *265/280/285, missed the third*

By the time my flight was called for deadlifts, it was pretty late.  I had some chicken and rice and an energy drink while the other flights were lifting, and started warming up.  My last rep at 235 felt a little off, so I took it again and felt a bit better.  I opened at 265 and it felt a little heavier than it normally would — probably because it’d been a long day.  280 on my second wasn’t bad, but it felt heavy, and it felt like forever before I got the down command.  I started to worry about my third attempt.  Originally, I had had thoughts of taking 300 kilos if everything was going well (which it had), but I didn’t have 300 in me that day.  Jacob called for 285 — just enough to put me into fourth, but too much that I would have to get in my head about it.  He sent me to the back of the room and told me to put my headphones in and hoodie on.  I got up for 285, was aggressive off the floor, and really thought I pulled it OK, but got three reds for hitching.


**Final Thoughts**

Even missing my last deadlift, I finished with a 655 total, which was good enough for fifth place and a medal.  Jacob jokingly told me that the last pull was for a jump from sixth to fourth, but I was so out of it by the end that I thought he was serious and that I had missed out on hardware.  It was a nice surprise at the awards ceremony!  In case you couldn’t tell, none of that would have happened without Jacob.  He talked me into doing the meet in the first place, and was the best coach/handler I could imagine.  All in all, I ended up with a lifetime squat PR, meet PRs on all three lifts and my total, and a 439 Wilks, which was good enough to qualify me to lift at the Arnold in March.  It was a great weekend, by far the best meet I’ve ever had, and I’m looking forward to the next one.

**Meet Prep**

I actually signed up for this meet on the deadline date, so I didn't do any special peaking program. I ran a 9 week cycle of the cube method then I tested my opener and 2nd attempt 2 weeks before the meet. 

**Making Weight**

On Monday I was 208.8lbs and I wanted to compete in the 198 class (the meet was on Saturday). I knew I was carrying a lot of water weight and I used the water loading protocol to cut.

* **Monday** – Drank 3 gallons of water and did not worry about the foods I ate. This made me bloat like crazy.
* **Tuesday** – Drank 3 gallons of water again except I did not eat carbs, very low sodium, and no creatine (red meat included)
* **Wednesday** – Drank 2.5 gallons of water and followed the same diet
* **Thursday** – Drank 1 gallon of water and followed the same diet. The difference was that I shut off water intake and food intake at 5pm.
* **Friday** – Weigh ins were at 11am and I ended up weighing in at 197lbs. I was not dehydrated at all.

I had done a water cut for my first meet but I was very dehydrated the whole time, but this time I fixed a few things and it went better than I expected.

After I weighed in the feast started. I ate everything and anything I saw. I went to bed around 208 that night. 

**Squat**

345lbs – I forgot to tighten my belt so basically I squated without it. It felt fine though

375lbs – I went way too deep on this one. I'm still not sure why I dipped so low, but I still got the lift

385lbs (PR) – I made sure I didn't go too deep and the lift was much easier

**Bench**

245lbs – I opened very light and I smoked it

275lbs – It felt good and I was excited to try for a new PR. (my current gym PR bench is 285)

290lbs (No lift) – I don't wanna talk about it

**Deadlift **

455lbs - Felt easy and it was quick. I didn't expect anything else

500lbs - It went up pretty fast, but I struggled a little

525lbs (No lift) – I was drained by this point and that is the story I am sticking to

**Overall**

This meet went pretty well and I ended up going 7/9. I didn't hit the exact numbers I would like to have, but it is still an improvement from my first meet (1110 at 198)

**For the future**

I am going to take it easy this week, but after that I am running the whole smolov program, but I am still debating whether to run smolov jr. for my bench along side it. I want to try something different and just focus my attention to one lift at a time. In the past I have tried to improve all my lifts at the same time and it really didn't work (or at least I didn't get the results that I wanted)

I tried for 490 on the squat on my third and tried for 600 on deadlift twice and I failed all of those so I didn't upload those videos. I felt like I could have gotten those lifts had it been a normal day, but it had been about 10 hours between my first squat and my 600 attempt at deadlift. I was very happy with my bench press, that's about 10 pounds away from a national record in my weight and age class. Overall I ended up breaking every state record in my age and weight class and I got a big ass trophy for first place in my division. I was glad I entered and it was totally worth it.

Sorry, no videos yet, but I figured I'd give a rundown of what the meet was like.

Leading up) Slept terribly the night before, pretty standard, forgot to bring my pillow from home which is really key to me sleeping well, and I don't normally sleep very well before a meet anyway.  I felt decent going in anyway.

Squat:
Warmups all felt really loose, but not particularly strong, 445 and 485 weren't particularly strong but I was opening light (517) and wasn't worried

235 - 3 whites - I knew something was wrong now, this lift wasn't nearly as good as it should have been the bar started coming forward which normally does not happen until I am close to max

250 - 3 whites - Horrible lift, essentially complete max effort.  After this lift my brother told me that my feet looked really narrow.

255 - 3 whites - WAY easier than the second, brought my stance out 3-4 inches and things finally worked.

I gave up hope of winning the meet here because Nick Tylutki squatted 305kg, so I was pretty much dead.

Takeaway: I need to work on my setup so that I can firstly figure out the exact stance that I want, and secondly hit that stance exactly the same every single time.

Bench Press - I had strained my pec 1 week before this so I wasn't expecting a fantastic day benching, but it seemed to be cooperating through warmups

160kg -  In my normal setup I was unable to get my feet perfectly flat, so I had to hold the bar at lockout for about 10 seconds before having to re-rack the bar 

170kg - On the way down things started to feel iffy and when I reached the bottom my pec was re-injured and I almost told the spotters to take it.  Instead I decided to try,  somehow I finished the lift, got 3 whites and passed on my third.

After my this I was in 4th place, but I figured there was a pretty good shot at finishing in second since deadlift is my best lift and I was only 12.5kg behind 2nd I believe.

Takeaway: I need to get my chest and shoulder healthy.

Deadlift:
Warmups went decently, i was a little tired due to lack of sleep.  I wasn't completely on top of my game, but I was feeling pretty good.
277.5kg - 1st attempt deadlift is always a light warmup, 3 whites
307.5kg - Really fast, no struggle at all, 3 whites
332.5kg - Both of the other people with a chance to finish second missed their deadlifts so I had locked up second place.  This led me to go for a relatively stupid attempt, as opposed to going fo ran 8lb PR of 330kg which I believe there was a pretty good chance of me making, I decided to go for a 14lb PR and try for 332.5kg because why not I got nothing to lose and nothing to gain.  I ended up getting it just above my knees and missing there, which is where I always miss.

Final: Totaled 732.5kg which is not even close to PR territory, but I probably could have totalled 755kg if I had gone for a 330kg pull at the end.  I finished 2nd, about 55kg behind first IIRC.  Was my best finish at the Arnold and I wasn't upset with the results because missing that last deadlift was a bit of my just going nuts because I already had second place locked up and wanted to see if I could pull this out of my ass.

Overall impressions:  Need to get my squat consistent, my chest healthy, and my eyes less big than my deadlift.

I don't have much experience doing it though, so I'm not really sure if I'm doing it right. I feel like I have flexible hamstrings so it's also not coming very naturally to me. A quick search failed to bring up any relevant results. 

I figure that the more I progress the tighter my hamstrings will become and the more pronounced the bounce might be?

edit: broke out the ol' SS book again (was going to do that first but I was hoping for some first hand experience or youtube vids or something). 
""The bounce you feel when you stretch out the hamstrings, glutes, and the adductors at the bottom of the squat is not due to knee ligament tightness or rebound...You bounce off the stretched and tightened components of the posterior chain and the now correctly loaded quadriceps, and it is absolutely safe for the knees""

It also advises not to go down too fast because that probably means a looser descent, and to just think about going up the whole time you're going down, don't pause too much in between.

Once I get the weight off the ground, I can complete the set (3-5 reps), but the first 1-2 inches is a killer. I also don't bounce the weight, I set it down for about 1 second between reps, so that shouldn't be the issue.

Rip recommends jumping up and slowly lowering because the movement is the reverse of a pull up, others recommend band assisted pullups because they're nonlinear. I haven't seen much talk about either the counter-weight assisted machine or lat pulldowns.

Recently I tried a plate loaded counter-weight assisted pull up machine, [similar to this one](http://media3.onsugar.com/files/2011/11/45/1/192/1922729/fb37a0f02815fd5b_assistedpullup.jpg) and I liked it for several reasons:

* I can pick a counter weight (55lbs) that lets me do 3sets of 5 from all the way down to sternum to the bar.

* I can incrementally deload by 2.5lbs or 5lbs.

* Resting my knees on the pad prevents me from cheating by bringing my knees forward in the top half of the pull up. Also I don't get cramps in my hamstrings from keeping them as tight as possible.

* Reps feel much more consistent in terms of speed, effort, and ROM than when I jump up and slowly try to lower myself.

One problem I noticed is that the bottom position was a little bit different from a regular pull up, i.e. my center of gravity was behind the bar rather than directly under it. Other than that what's wrong with  working on getting to 3x5 pull ups this way?

Deadlift 1: 225kg. 3 white lights|
Deadlift 2: 240kg. 3 white lights|
Deadlift 3: 252,5kg/555lbs. 3 white lights (7,5kg PR)

Total: 1183lbs/537,5kg (raw)


Thoughts: This is a 15kg total PR, which IMO isn't that impressive, however there were quite a few obstacles which impaired my ability to train properly. 

In the beginning of August I got sick until the 15th. That day I also went to Kashmir in India to visit my relatives. There was no decent gym there, nor was there any protein-rich nutrition, so during my 3week stay I lost quite a bit of weight. When I returned home, I had recieved a sweet parting gift from India in the form of Gastritis, and just as I recovered from that I got a severe cold. Then I got to train for one week, which was until this monday, before I was informed of the upcoming meet. So this total is truly what I can perform when I'm at the lowest of the low, therefore, the end result is something I can't be disappointed at.


That's all for me, have a good one!

[Here is the program that I concocted using GZCL's methods.](http://i.imgur.com/pP2ASDS.png) You will notice that I have incorporated OHP as one of my main lifts. Why? Because having a sick OHP is pretty awesome.

* Bench: 240 lbs x 4 (110 kg)

* Squat: 340 lbs x 3 (155 kg)

* Deadlift: 365 lbs x 5 (165 kg)
 
* OHP: 145 lbs x 6 (65 kg)

* Squat: 350 lbs x 5 (160 kg)

You can also check out my [meet report from May](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1f3283/meet_report_nasa_south_texas_open_alvin_texas_usa/) which was after about 6 weeks on the program.

**Impressions:** Everything went up except my weight. That's great! I even noticed a decent increase in size. Bonus! But why did my squat not improve much? The answer is that I hurt my knee during the first week of the 3rd cycle and had to take 3 weeks off from squatting. In the meantime I continued to bench, OHP, and RDL (couldn't get into a normal DL position). Knee is feeling good now. My DL and OHP have probably gotten even better than what is listed above. The bench and squat I tested this week but the DL and OHP PRs are from about about 4 weeks ago.

This program is not for the feint of heart. I ate at maintenance for most the program but I would recommend you eat at a surplus. I'm pretty sure I left some gains on the table by not eating as much but at 220 I'm already a fat fuck. Carbing hard the night before seemed to give me the best results.

There is no such thing as a light day for any of the main lifts. I thought I was going to be able to include power cleans and power snatches in the program but I just could never find a way to fit them in without feeling wrecked. I definitely learned that I don't do enough pre-hab. I think that the knee injury plus two smaller injuries to my wrist and back are attributable to this and if I am going to continue using it I will need to keep up with foam rolling and dynamic stretching. I'm still on the fence about whether this program is too much volume for me. I have had success in the past doing lower volume programs like Madcow and TM. However, I feel like there is peaking happening in those programs whereas the GZCL method feels like it is generating solid gains that will last (the base of my pyramid definitely feels much stronger). I would recommend this program to anyone that is serious about getting really strong and doesn't mind shedding a little blood, sweat, and tears in the process. 

I'm going to start cycle 4 on Monday. This time I will be doing more pre-hab and eating more calories. Hopefully this will help alleviate some of the challenges I had. My goal for 2013 is to break a 1200 total in the gym at 220.

The reasoning is that access to the smaller plates causes paralysis of analysis (should I do 257x5 or 280x5?). So about 6 weeks ago I dropped my current programing of 3 sets of 5 adding 5 lbs a week and started macroloading my lifts. I am 5'10"" 178lbs and lean bulking (gained about 2 lbs in the 6 weeks); while I realize my lifts are still pretty intermediate I found this progression much more enjoyable than monotonously doing my 3x5 each week. I felt that the higher rep work did wonder for my work capacity as well.

* Squat went from a shaky 280x5 to a strong 315x5/275x10 (all done onto a 1"" below parallel box)

* Bench went from 225x1 to 225x4 (Bench and OHP had been stalled at the same weight for a couple months prior.)

* Deadlift went from 335x3 to 315x10/405x1

* OHP 145x1 to 165x1 (Although I used 10lbs weights for OHP progression)

An example squat day would look like this: warm up until I get to 315 and rep that out aiming to add 1 rep per week and then a couple singles or doubles, drop to 275 then rep that out for a couple sets and then drop to 225 and rep it out.

**Meet Prep**

My last meet was March 23rd, so I didn't have much time to prep for this one. I trained like I normally do, then took a week off (minus some light squat/bench speed work up to Wednesday) to defatigue prior to the meet. I've been training high frequency for the past several months, and it's been working well. Consistent increases in weight, and I don't feel like shit all the time. I very rarely go over 80% in training, which I feel is worth noting. It's been good to me thus far. The week of the meet, I dropped down from about 178 to 173... which was fucking pointless and definitely didn't do my bench or deadlift any favors. No more of that. I won't cut any weight unless I absolutely have to, Wilks be damned.

**Squat**

1. 347 lbs (3 whites)
* 374 lbs (3 whites)
* 396 lbs (3 whites)  

* Squat went really well for me, but it was about the only thing that did. Final attempt felt surprisingly easy. 22 lb PR, too. Not sure how I managed that. 

**Bench**

1. 231 lbs (3 whites)
* 253 lbs (3 reds - straight up failed)
* 253 lbs (3 whites - barely went up)
 
* My bench felt and looked like shit. I attribute it to cutting weight and generally being a little bitch. If I can't hit at least 275 at my next meet, I'll be legitimately disappointed with myself. My bench has been stalled for months, and that's inexcusable. 

**Deadlift**

1. 424 lbs (3 whites)
* 463 lbs (3 whites)
* 496 lbs (3 reds - 100% fail)

* Going into this meet, I was real fuckin' excited about these. I pulled an easy 451 at my last meet. I figured I'd give ~500 a go at this one. 463 came up easily enough (12 lb PR), but 496 wouldn't budge. I think a lot of this has to do with fatigue. The meet was huge, and it started late, so I'd been there a long time since weigh-ins. Less fatigued, I'd at least have gotten that shit off the floor. Next time, 500+. 

**Overall**

I did ok. Wound up with a couple PRs, but nothing too crazy. I've increased my total by 105 lbs since my first meet (Dec. 15th). I think that's pretty decent progress for a little over 4 months. I could be wrong. If my progress actually sucks, please inform me. I won't be competing again for at least 6 months, so I'll have plenty of time to hammer my weaknesses.

## Pre Meet
I’ve just finished my first cycle of Juggernaught coming into this meet though I was liberal with not taking deload weeks on a couple of waves (8s, 5s) so that I could fit the cycle before this meet.  Also, I moved city twice and countries once during the build-up so it wasn’t exactly a perfect run through in the early waves.

Since it had been so long since I’ve tested, I wanted to leave space on my third lift to surprise myself.  Juggernaught had me tripling my previous sqaut 1RM (180kg) a week out from comp and doubling my previous bench 1RM (115kg) so I wanted to give them both space for a big improvement. This meant ofcourse a higher than normal chance of missing my thirds (and in hindsight, my seconds) but I assumed would be worth it.

Have always had trouble being heavy enough, so I threw in a couple of weeks on 2 litres chocolate milk a day which helped add a few kilos, made me a bit squishier than normal though. I weighed in at 103kg, fairly dry, by far my heaviest and close to my goal weight.

##Squat
First attempt was cozy, the competition bar was different than every other bar I’ve used which made setting up the grip a bit more difficult than normal. The second attempt was a 10kg PR.  I had missed 190kg before for depth (rwr), so was keen to finally get it.

If you’d asked me before the meet, what attempt I was most likely to fail it would be this one.  Aside from the 10 minutes before hand I never thought it would happen.  It comes in probably as my slowest lift ever, realy grind, but once your halfway up you know you can make.  It was a bit of a ‘squat-mourning’ but I’m guilty of worse.  20kg PR, and very happy.

## Bench
The first was very easy.  I overly cautious on Bench for openers since I’ve bombed a meet missing my opener before.  Flew up.

Since my numbers are no where near enough to win, I decided to go for a safe opener, a PR for number 2, and overly optimistic for my third.  On bench this meant a larger jump than normal (for me) but to 120kg, which I haven’t attempted before.  Since I doubled 115kg a couple of weeks before I really thought it would happen.  I was wrong. The third attempt was the same, maybe an inch more (I have giant arms).  Dissappointed.

##Deadlift

My plan was really to only do two lifts and go all out on my 2nd attempt.  This worked well for me at a team event last year where I was only deadlifting, so I decided to stick with it in this format as well.  Is this a common strategy? I knew 230kg was very doable (I had tripled 220kg a couple of weeks before) so wasn’t surprised when it came up.

My second attempt (250kg) went horribly wrong, the lifter before me had an injury, but instead of timing him out (as they had done other lifters that day) they cut him from the line up at the last second, I wasn’t quite in the right mind space yet and was a bit rushed getting up to the platform which was a bummer.  Bar came up unevenly, probably a result of a bad setup which was unsurprising. just cleared mid shin.

Third attempt (250kg) I got the mind set and timing right but just didn’t have it in the tank.  Got the bar to just below the knee.

## Post Meet
My next meet will be the New Zealand Nationals at the end of September.  I’ve still got a lot of way to go as an intermediate lifter, so should see some good gains again.  I’m going to stay in 105kg, I’m never really going to be competitive in that class given my height, but it’s good my partner (she’s tiny) and for my own sanity with food.  I’m still getting a lot out of the sport.

I really want to pull a big deadlift this year (280kg?), so will be trying to bring some focus to that In training.  I also think this meet has shown me that my conditioning is lagging behind, so I think I’ll spend the next couple of months building an aerobic base for the work to come.  After a deload week I’m thinking of running Smolov jnr on bench and either Coan/Philipi or Magnusson/ Ortmayer for deadlift.  I’ll probably just run 5/3/1 for squat while I do that.

Which leads to my next point, what really is it that makes throwers as strong as they are? Is it the nature of their sport?

Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRJglm3LTj0

------------------------------------

As the title says, this was my first meet. It was awesome and I can't wait to do it again when I'm closer to 100%.

I hurt my lower back 4 weeks ago, which kept me from squatting or deadlifting over 365 until last Saturday, when I got 405 on each for a single. Furthermore, I kept straining my pecs each time I benched for about 3 weeks straight. I knew I could get around 90% though.

I weighed in at 221.4 after dehydrating and losing 7 pounds. I couldn't get down another 0.9 lbs. It's fine though. 242s it is!

My warm ups for squat and bench felt pretty terrible. Everything felt heavy. Deadlift was...okay.

**Squat:** 405/455/500. This was completely unexpected. I haven't gotten anything over 475 in about 8 months. 500 was a piece of sweet, sweet cake though. All time PR in the gym is 515. Would have tried to break that if I'd known how good I'd feel.

**Bench:** 345/365/Pass. This was completely expected. My pec hurt a lot, but it didn't rip in half or anything. My 365 was a horrible grind and my left thoracic extensors were cramping up from the moment he said ""press"" until I finished the lift. This was 10 lbs. under my gym paused PR.

**Deadlift:** 405/495/555. This was an awesome way to end the meet. It was easy. Again, if I had known how I'd perform, I would have called for 585 probably. But 555 was a 10 lb. conventional PR. I used to pull sumo, but switched to conventional. I like it a lot more now.

I'm 5' 7.5"" and 27 years old. I've been lifting for close to 5 years now, although I didn't really start making good progress until around October of last year when I finally started using decent strength training programs (Madcow and Ed Coan's deadlift program) and bulked past my comfort zone. Then starting in March of this year I ran 531 for about 7 cycles. 531 did wonders for my squat. In the first cycle I was able to do 285x10, and in cycle 6 I had reached 350x10. My deadlift didn't go up nearly as much, I went from 385x4 to 405x5 (not touch-n-go), and my bench press didn't actually go up at all during that time mainly because I had been fighting brachilialis tendinitis for a good 5 months and it made benching heavy nearly impossible.

Prior to this meet my unofficial total was 1125 with a 415lb squat, 255 bench (not paused), and a 455lb sumo deadlift (conventional was 450). I had hit the 415lb squat and the 455lb sumo deadlift 2 weeks prior to the meet in training.


**Meet Prep**

When I had signed up for the meet back in September, I was weighing in at 185-186lbs. Since it was my first real meet, I didn't want to do anything drastic, but I knew I could easily get into the 181 weight class with a little work. So I decided to do a small cut and it only took me 3 weeks to get there. For the first couple weeks I just lowered my calorie intake and for the 3rd week I went full blown Ultimate Diet 2.0. While glycogen depleted I was down to 177 and fully carbed up I was sitting at 181-182. After the cut I just spent the remaining 3 weeks prior to the meet maintaining my weight.

Shout out to shortkid for the advice of how to taper for the last 3 weeks prior to my meet. 3 weeks out I worked up to my openers on all 3 lifts. 2 weeks out I worked up to what would be a new 1 or 2RM. 1 week out I worked up to my openers followed by no lifting the whole week except for a very light workout the Tuesday before just to keep myself loosened up.

The meet had a 2 hour weigh in and just to make sure I made weight for the 181 weight class I ate a little bit less the day before, cut back on salt intake, and drank a bunch of water. Nothing drastic that could hurt my lifts.

**Meet Day**

I drove up to Cleveland the night before and stayed in a hotel, and as I expected I slept like shit due to all the excitement. I tried to go to bed at 11:30PM, ended up laying there for a good hour until I dozed off at around 12:30AM, then I woke up at 1:30AM, and then a few minutes later I fell asleep until 5AM, and then pretty much laid there awake until my alarm went off at 6:15AM. All in all I maybe got 4 hours of sleep.

I got up, got ready, and made it to the site at about 7:15AM. Signed in, paid for my USAPL membership card, picked my opening attempts, and then proceeded to gear check.

My gear I brought with me:

 * House of Pain singlet
 * Inzer wrist wraps
 * Adidas powerlift shoes
 * New Balance minimus zero road shoes for deadlifts
 * Titan knee sleeves
 * Grey t-shirt, I wanted to wear my DYEL? shirt but they wouldn't let me
 * Some cheap briefs from wal-mart since they won't let you wear boxer briefs
 * Knee high compression socks

After gear check I then had to pick my adjustments for bench height and squat rack height and write them on my card. After all of that I finally made it to the weigh-in, and to my surprise I weighed in at 177, well under the 181 I was shooting for! Immediately after weigh-in I ate a pack of cherry poptarts, some reeses peanut butter cups, some dried mango, and downed a bottle of water and a bottle of vitamin water. I still had a good half-hour before the mandatory rules meeting so I drove to a nearby starbucks and got a Caramel Macchiato with an extra shot of espresso (3 shots of espresso total). Then during the meet I ate some more pop-tarts, a banana, a bunch of water, a can of AMP, and 2 red bulls.

I started warming up for squats around 9AM and then the meet then started at 9:30AM. There were around 90 lifters there total and they had the equipped lifters mixed into the same groups as the raw lifters. I was in Flight 1 Group C.  One mistake I made was that I thought they were going to do the 1st attempts for Group A, then 1st attempts for Group B, etc.. but no, they did all 3 attempts for Group A, then all 3 for B, and then C. So really I warmed up a little bit too early and had to sit there a bit, but overall I don't think it hurt me too bad.

**Squats**

Got 3 whites on all my squats and my attempts were:

* 1st: 375
* 2nd: 395
* 3rd: 420

I must admit it was a bit nerve racking seeing so many people in the previous groups bomb out or not hit depth on their squats. My first attempt was 375, which was a bit conservative considering 375 is my 5RM or less, but I got up there and nailed it easily. Right after I finished it the head judge pointed at me, paused for a bit (at this point I thought I did something wrong), and then said ""don't make it look so easy"". I laughed, turned around and saw 3 white lights, and was pretty pumped from that point on. Nailed my 2nd attempt at 395, and then got 420 for my 3rd attempt. The 420 was definitely my highlight of the day and the lift I wanted the most.

**Bench Press**

Went 2/3 on bench, which is definitely my weakest lift. I had already hit a paused 235 in training, but I was unsure of anything beyond that. Went for 250 on my 3rd attempt and missed it. Definitely need to do some more work here and figure out how to increase my bench, or just remain a T-Rex 5ever. I also thought I strained my lower back really bad during the 250 attempt because it started hurting pretty bad right when the bar started going back down, you can see in the video where I get up and put my hand on my lower back. Maybe I was arching my back too much? Luckily it felt better by the time I got to deadlifts.

* 1st: 220
* 2nd: 235
* 3rd: 250 (Missed)


**Deadlift**

Went 3/3 on these and hit a 20lb PR! I switched to doing sumo instead of conventional and it just feels so much better for me, and with how the 475 went up I'm almost certain that I'll be hitting 500 soon.

* 1st: 405
* 2nd: 445
* 3rd: 475

[Video of lifts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rBPhH7lou8)


Overall this was a huge success. Very happy to have totaled over 1100 and hit a new squat and deadlift PR.

My plan now is to cut to 165 and then compete at the USAPL Raw Nationals in Orlando next July as long as there isn't a qualifying total for it!

The meet was held at Iron Sport Gym in Glenolden, PA (where I train regularly). 

Squat- 225 (good), 240 (2 red lights), 255 (failed to complete)

Bench- 115 (good), 125 (good), 140 (failed to complete)

Deadlift- 295 (good), 325 (good), 350 (failed to complete)

This was my first meet and I totaled 675. I've totaled 730 in training with all 3 lifts on the same day, so I think I could have done better. But nerves got to me and I either rushed the setup and failed because of that, or was too slow/deliberate on the descent and ran out of steam when it was time to push. I'll know better next time. Numbers aside, this was one of the most fun experiences of my life and I can't wait to do it again.

**Making Weight** I had weighed myself at 131 lb. one week out, so it probably wasn't necessary to cut weight. But I wanted to be absolutely sure, so for 1 week I followed the diet outlined in the ""making weight"" appendix of Jamie Hale's book, *Protein Essentials.* After I weighed in on Friday at 129 lb., I spent the entire day chugging Pedialyte and eating sweet potatoes and chicken. Come Saturday morning, I was fully rehydrated and had plenty of energy to lift. 

**Training** I've been doing Wendler's 5/3/1, but everyone at my gym seems to think that the program doesn't have enough volume, so I usually do 3-5 extra sets at the maximum weight. My accessory work is a little different from anything Wendler outlines, and I can provide details if anyone is interested. 

**Summary** The meet ran VERY long, but it was worth it. Kate Baird and Steve Pulcinella did a great job of running the show. The spotters, loaders, judges, and all other organizers were awesome, too... Although I think judge Bill Dorell's white light button must have been broken due to the number of red lights he gave =P

There were a ton of lifters in this meet... But not a lot of women. I was a bit disappointed by that, but not surprised. Ladies: if you've ever even thought about competing, please do it! Would be awesome to see more of you on the platform. Anyway, we had a large turnout of local lifters from both Iron Sport and Jersey Iron. Shawn Boylan, a lifter from Iron Sport, returned to the platform after a four-year hiatus due to a knee injury from squatting at a different meet, and he was definitely looking strong. The Yale Powerlifting Club also came out for the meet. There were some very big lifts, including some huge 4th attempt deadlifts. I actually had no idea you could get a 4th attempt after making all 3 of your required attempts, so THAT is something I'll be remembering for my next UPA meet. If I'd known that ahead of time, I wouldn't have gone for a PR on my third attempt; I would have kept it a little more conservative and tried to hit my training max, then gone for the PR if I got a 4th attempt. In general, I wish I had taken more time to set up. I know for a fact that I wouldn't have failed my last squat attempt if my feet hadn't been so far behind my shoulders... I leaned too far into it, and thus it kind of turned into a good morning. Oh well, I'll know for next time. 

Another neat thing about this meet: they told us that there has never been a UPA meet in Pennsylvania, so the best lift of the day is automatically a state record. Having won my weight class, I guess this means I might currently be a state record holder... Until the next UPA event in PA, when someone will inevitably break said record. Unless I can step up my game and beat them to it, of course =)

The whole experience was a lot more laid back and friendly than I expected. Really, no one seems to be competing AGAINST each other. We were all cheering each other on, and it seems like in general you're pretty much competing against yourself. I made a lot of new friends, had a great time, and am already trying to scope out the next event so I can start preparing to compete again.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_sywnu,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/sywnu/meet_report_upa_iron_sport_power_classic_42812/,

Relatively happy with the squat for now, though today form started breaking down again at 180 lbs (mostly me squat-morning-ing too much).

The clean... 
1. Butt zooms up first (think it's a bad habit from DLing)
2. Bar too far in front of me
3. More of a speed reverse curl 
4. Haven't figured out how to catch any lower than standing

The jerk-
1. Leaning too far back (overcompensating for smashing myself in the jaw before, I think)
2. Not splitting deep enough

This was really a wonderful meet.  [All proceeds will go toward Belle's medical bills.](https://www.facebook.com/events/391550810940588/permalink/405774086184927/)  I had a lot of fun and really appreciate the effort the organizers went to in throwing this meet.

**History**  [TMI] [Girl Stuff]

This meet has been a long time coming for me.  At about this time last year, I [competed in my state meet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/q7t19/meet_report_20120226_usapl_wa_state/)  A couple of months later, my endo put me on Metformin to treat the out of control weight gain that was the most recent fun gift from my [PCOS.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycystic_ovary_syndrome)  We can add reactive hypoglycemia and almost passing out from a blood sugar test to my list of symptoms :)

Anyway, the Metformin made me sick like I had food poisioning for the first couple of months I was on it.  This gradually tapered back to the point were I was eating at least one full meal each day.  I tried to continue lifting throughout all of this, but had to seriously back off squatting and deadlifting because I would start to black out if I put any real weight on the bar.  The weight that did this got lighter and lighter, until it finally progressed to the point where I couldn't even squat down to pet my cat without getting woozy on the way back up.  I stopped squatting and deadlifting entirely at this point, and did a bunch of research of how to raise blood pressure.  Lots of salt did not work.

Around January, my endo finally did some vitamin/mineral blood tests and found that I was a little low on magnesium.  I took some ZMA for a couple of days, then went to the gym and tried squatting.  BAM!  Problem solved.  No more tunnel vision and popped ears when standing up.

I started lifting again on a modified SS where I did front squats every other time.  I was squat morninging quite badly, this helped.  I wasn't getting stronger like I should have.  My ears ringing from my loving SO's complaints that I was starving myself, I started tracking my calories.  I was eating 800-1,200 calories a day.  Usually closer to 800 than 1,200.  I'd stop eating when I got nauseated.

Realizing that this was my new normal, the only fix for it was some good, old-fashioned resolve.  I started tracking calories each day.  In order to hit my minimums, I started eating a lot more carbs than I had been.  After a few weeks of this, my strength started to go up again.  I signed up for the meet I'm writing about here.  I switched the normal SS program to lifting 4 times a week with a squat+leg day, a bench+arm day, a front squat/deadlift day, and an ohp+shoulder day.  My shoulders are very weak, so I was doing something for my shoulders every day except deadlift day.

**Meet Preparation**

I just continued doing what I was doing, in the hopes of catching my last-year's self's strength.  The only exception is that I did not go all out on my last deadlift day before the meet.  I did not lift the week before the meet.  

This was my first 24 hour weigh-in.  It was fun, though not as fun as I'd expected.  The weigh in was on Friday.  I cut out carbs from Monday afternoon until Friday, which made me drop 7lbs on my home scale.  I came in at 198.0, the only woman in my class.  I celebrated with a York patty, then went to an Italian dinner and had a giant piece of lasagna, which I could only eat half of.  A little later, I had a milkshake.  Thus, I destroyed any help my Synthroid might have done me, because I took it about a half hour later, not on an empty stomach.

One thing to note is that I did screw up my Metformin timing.  I should have had it with dinner, because I knew the meet started at 10am.  This is a 12 hour extended release medication - if you take it early you're doubling the amount that can trash your stomach.  I took the next dose about 10 hours later, and spent the first two squat flights fighting the urge to vomit.

**Day of the Meet**

The weigh in had been the day before, but I felt ill.  I ate half a banana for breakfast and later chewed on some beef jerky.  I concentrated on hydrating rather than eating.

In my second deadlift, I started to tip backwards after lockout.  I couldn't stay up and stumbled back a step.  Afterwards I was super shaky.  Not sure what happened there, it's never happened to me before.

**Aftermath**

I got some really good feedback from one of the other lifters.  I'm apparently straightening my knees on deadlift well before I should be, and am not holding my upper body upright.  People have been telling me to keep my ass down, now I know the cause of the problem.  He gently chastised me for not filming my own lifts, allowing for self correction.  D'oh!

I'm mostly pleased with how I did.  I didn't do as well as last year, but I'm bouncing back from a really hard time, and I feel like my progress has been good.  I'll continue to work on my form, my eating, and my strength.  I'll look for another meet sometime in the fall.

This was my first competition. I'll try to put in all the details.

Prep was non existent as I have CPU (IPF) Nationals 6 weeks after this competition (aka 3 weeks from now). I went in to just qualify for Nationals, so all I needed was a 215kg total which was not an issue. I did a water cycle to drop the last pound or so. I weighed in the morning of the meet at 63.5kg, so I had to drop 0.5kg fast. So out came the cup and I got to have the joy of spitting out the last few grams. Ended up weighing in at a safe 62.85kg. Either my home scale is high, or I suck at water cycles. Good note for next time.

The competition was the biggest one the BCPA has ever hosted with 105 people, so we had to run two platforms. It was run extremely smoothly and over all there were mostly no issue. There were three warm up platforms and some of the more experienced people helped keep them in control. Over all my lifts were good, went something like this (in kg):

Squat: 75, 85, 95kg

Bench: 55, 62.5, 70kg

Deadlift: 85, 100, 115kg

All good lifts, which was the point of my meet. I wanted to gain confidence so I could make Nationals and kick butt there. Here's a video of all of them:

[Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FN-Tz__gCVU)

This was my first meet.  I started lifting about 9 months ago (I lifted in high school but that ended 10 years ago), doing Stronglifts for ~4 months then switching to 5/3/1.  I've been focusing on losing weight over getting stronger, dropping about 60 lbs in that time.

The meet overall went well.  There were about 15 lifters, plus a few bench only lifters.  I wasn't too sure what to expect.  I was a little nervous on my first squat, but I felt a lot better after it.  I didn't do any special meet prep, just taking a deload week before the meet.  The thing I was least prepared for was warming up.  I've never tried to max out in the gym, so I wasn't sure what I should do for warmups, or what I could get on a third attempt.

I was fairly confident in my squat attempts and I probably could've done 10+ more.  Bench had been giving me the most trouble in the gym, and I adjusted my attempts down from what I was planning.  I might've been able to get 275, but I wasn't confident about it and picked 270.  I think I had a ton more in the tank for deadlifts.  I based my attempts on what I've done in the gym, but since I've never spent a day testing my max, it was all based on 5/3/1 work sets and the occasional single of my training max.

I will try to keep examples relevant to us pick-up-and-put-down-ers, however, these skills are basically life skills.

#Forging the Iron Mind

##Foundation

Before anything you need to have a few *understandings* working for you:

1. **Control**: I am the cause of all outcomes in my life and I determine its course. Everything good in your life you made happen, all the things you don't have but want... you ain't made it happen yet.
2. **Confidence**:  I have the ability to affect the outcomes in my life. Through education, experience, or just plain *cojones* you know you can take on anything life throws at you.
3. **Commitment**: I finish what I start. I will be consistent until the end; doing whatever is necessary. Commitment implies both consistency and giving it 100% effort.
4. **Challenge**: I require challenge to grow; when I fail, I learn from it. It is very important to understand that you can learn and grow from failure.

Another foundational skill set is what I like to call the mental *gamestate*:

* **Focus**:Focus your attention *on the objective* like a laser or a spotlight. Intense focus.
* **Indifference to distraction**: If focus is like a spotlight, this is like dimming the rest of the room.
* **Arousal control**: Some objectives require energy and strength, others calm and concentration.  Learn to recognize when you are nervous and cue yourself to relax. Learn how to get yourself **FUCKING HYPED UP**. Figure out what part of your game requires what kind of arousal and learn how to flip the switch when you need it. Google: progressive muscle relaxation

From here on I'll refer to whatever it is you are doing as the *game*.

##Pregame

###Goals
Take this time to set goals for yourself. Short and long-term, all that jazz. Like all things goals will change as you learn more about what you're doing. At the beginning of the year your goal might be ""look good naked"", a few months later you'll have target sizes for muscles and muscle proportions, by the end of the year you've got an excel spreadsheet with bodyfat percentages and nutrient macros.  Google: S.M.A.R.T. goals

An example goal for me would be to deadlift 4 plates within a year. (*Nuttin' but a peanut*).

###Plan
If a goal is *what* you want to achieve, the plan is *how* you are going to achieve it.  For example *Starting Strength* or *5/3/1*. In other parts of life the plan won't be so easy, but realize that you have to plan. Understand that no one can predict the future. You can't see every injury, stall, or setback.  You also can't see every short recovery, exceptional gainz, or any other assorted win. You will need to tweak the plan sometimes.  Sometimes you will need to scrap the plan because it sucks and something better showed up.  Or you learned more about what you need to be doing. No one just dips a paint brush into 10 cans of paints and creates a masterpiece in a single stroke. It takes time and effort and attention... but also a plan!

###Visualization
Now that you have a plan you need to get in some visualization.  This shit works if you do it right. See yourself doing perfect reps, feel yourself doing perfect reps.  Use all of your senses. Hear the gym noise, feel the tension in your muscles, the bar touching your chest. See yourself from the third person. Get creative. Always visualize the best possible outcome.

###Identity
Some people think these are cheesy but... who are you? Who the f&amp;mdash; do you think you are? Keep it short and positive. *As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.* 

A formula could be ""what i do; what that means"": 

* *I put in hard work at the gym; I can move mountains of iron.*  
* *I stretch and contract on every rep; my body is a masterpiece.*

Before you hit the gym remind yourself of who you are.

##GAMETIME *aka paintime*
Now is the time to put on your warface and put your mind into gamestate.

###Internal dialogue
What goes on in your head can either help or hurt, (or do nothing! kekeke). One of the best things you can do is *deliberate practice* always aim for perfection in your reps or sports.  The important thing is to break down what it means to be perfect and cue yourself. While some people have things like ""You can do this!"" or ""Oh god this is heavy"" or ""RAWR""  going on in their head these are pretty useless compared to a cue string like ""*hips back, knees knees knees, bounce, HIP DRAHVE*"" for the squat. What should be going on in your head is a distillation of the most important things about your game.  What do you need to do to either be perfect, or get closer to it. If your movement has a few parts to it make sure to have cues for each, like in bench pressing have a cue for setting up and a cue for reps. Make sure to keep it positive and specific. Examples such as ""Don't miss, don't miss"" or ""Gotta score"", revise them to be specifically *what do I need to do to not miss || score*.

Here's why you should not have negatives in your cues: *DON'T IMAGINE A PURPLE PUMPKIN DON'T IMAGINE A PURPLE PUMKPIN*.

###Solution focus
There's no such things as problems. That's just your shitty interpretation of reality. Always ask yourself how you can make things better. What specifically can you do to improve the situation? ""Problems"" should exist in your mind just long enough to be identified, after that all your brain cycles go towards figuring out a solution.

* I dropped my deadlift!!!!! *I need to do farmer's walks and pullups to make my grip strength less bitch-like*
* UGGGH fucking power cleans getting heavy, I can't rack this shit *I need to do more volume and hang cleans*
* Gotta squat and there's no racks *I can probably just punch the guy in the third rack and hang him on the dip station*

You get the idea. 

Don't stop the solution finding until you have an *actionable item*, something you can do. For the deadlift example just finding the problem isn't enough, also something like ""I need to get a stronger grip"" also isn't enough. You need something you can act on. And then do it. Can't stop, won't stop. 

##POSTGAME

###The After Action Report, Lessons Learned, *Dear Diary*
Keeping logs is important. If you have no idea where you are how will you know if you are going in the right direction? You won't, you are likely to be eaten by a grue.

Review your logs, did you meet your goals? Do better? Something needs improvement?

Reflect on the game. Did you learn anything? Is there something you can do better? Did your spotter point out that you fart in the hole while squatting. Fix your performance cues for next session.

Thank yourself for putting in the effort and giving yourself a great gift.

Hype yourself up for the next session.

* First meet! Saturday, Aug 3

I'm 17, walking weight ~165, standing at 5'6.25"" (yes it's important). I moved to the US from the Philippines the summer before 11th grade. Never been inside a weightroom before so I joined a hs weights class and became a curl bro. I bulked that year and put on ~30lbs (135&gt;165) with no training program, just messing around on machines/dumbbells etc. and eating 3000+ calories.

Eventually I started SS when summer started. 

Lift #'s:

    Early May 2013 &gt; Late July 2013

    Squat:     205 3x5 -&gt; 270 3x5
    Bench:     145 3x5 -&gt; 175 3x5
    Deadlift:  245 1x5 -&gt; 295 1x5

Instead of doing M/W/F, I elected to do it every other day, lifting 3/4 days a week. I started with light weights, 10-20lbs below my 5RM for each. Within two weeks I was hitting squat PRs every day and generally felt real satisfied.
My bench didn't fare so well, I stalled almost every other workout and never really felt like I was getting stronger. Probably not enough volume/accessory work but my max went from 205 unpaused -&gt; 200 paused, sub-optimal gains, but gains nonetheless.

For about a month and a half my deadlift was stuck at 245. This was due to me being scared to go heavy, didn't believe in mixed grip, didn't believe in chalk etc, just me being a wuss. One day I just wizened up, put 265 on (my true 5RM) and pulled two sets of 5. After that, I started progressing normally.

**Meet Prep**

I was still making good gains but I had to lay off about 1.5 weeks out. Took my deadlift opener wednesday, my squat opener friday, and my bench opener sunday the week of the meet. I did nothing the whole week, and tapered my calories down to maintenance. (3600 -&gt; 2800kcal).

I tried doing a simple water loading cut just to see how much i'd lose, 1.5-2.5gal a week out of weighins, then 0.5gal thursday. Also went on a fast from 12nn thursday till weighins. I weighed in at 160.4, a good 5-7 lbs from my normal weight. Immediately drank gatorade + water and ate a whole bunch of food.

**The Lifts**

* Went 8/9 Sorry about 240p and shakiness, mom was recording :)

**Squat**

* [120KG - make: Way easy. Didn't realize I go this deep](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRIy9Z5G2G0)
* 132.5KG - make: Easy. Could've opened with this.
* 140KG - make: Easy PR.

**Bench**

* [80KG - make: Easy.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAh4aDovtTY)
* [90KG - make: Paused PR!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUNlCOIYruM)
* [95KG - miss: Too heavy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWgUEaHWi-I)

**Deadlift**

* 127.5KG - make: Went lighter than normal as I thought i'd be tired at this point. I wasn't.
* [142.5KG - make: Easy PR. Felt like a warmup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW3NWa16D4g)
* [152.5KG - make: Felt SUPER Easy, but major (?) lower back rounding is something to work on](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKVBMhhv9R4)

**Results**

* Totaled 382.5kg / 843.26lbs.
* Yes, i am dirt poor and don't own a belt. It was the meet or a belt, and i chose the meet
* Easy PRs across the board, could gotten more weight up but i'm real happy with my performance. Squat and Deadlift both felt real good. Weakest guy there but everyone was supportive and I had a great time.

**Final thoughts**

* Back to my SS routine until my gains stop and I start stalling repeatedly. *Might* join another meet on either Sept 14 or Sept 28 depending on how things go. If not, Dec 28th
* Buy a nice belt
* Do some research on how to improve my press (More volume? More accessory?)
* Need to do a DL form check to see if rounding is evident on lower weights
* ^ Fix Dl form. I've done self form checks at lower weights (aka glancing sideways at the mirror) and they've been fine but not this time

[This article](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/4_weightlifting_myths_destroyed) from T-nation reminded me of my ignorance and confusion today, especially when homie said to break the bar on DL.

**In other words: ""Break the bar"" and ""bend the bar"" are often prescribed as coaching cues: Do you use these cues and what exactly do they mean?**

Of course the hand should apply a maximum crushing grip on the bar. 

**Bench**: I've heard ""bend the bar"" as a cue for powerlifting style bench (So you think you can bench series, [here](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/most_recent/4_weightlifting_myths_destroyed), etc.).. Do they mean (attempt to) bend it as if it were a 'U' shape at the top of the concentric, the 'horns' of the U towards your feet in a lateral direction; bend it as in applying a lateral pressure towards your feet? Or bend it in a vertical pressure towards the floor? 

**Squat**: Probably depends on high bar vs. low bar: Elbows under the bar is pretty well accepted, do you apply any lateral or vertical pressure with your forearms and scapulae?

**Deadlift**: I squeeze the shit out of the bar and use ""my arms are hooks"" to keep from flexing my biceps, and ""make your arms long/scapulae in your back pocket."" Do you use forearm pressure, ""break the bar"" or any cue related to this? How does one ""break the bar"" using mixed/baseball grip?

When I first began lifting in late 2011 with no previous meaningful experience (intermittently messing with machines), and after a decade of being mostly sedentary and extremely fat, my mobility was awful. I noticed almost immediately that traditional stretching didn't help at all. That's probably not news to many people here. When I learned about dynamic stretches for warmup, I noticed they would get some joints popping and feeling a little less stiff, but didn't seem to do anything for actually mobilizing me during training. 

Over the last year and a half, I've been working heavily on mobility, especially my shoulders, so that I can do whatever movements I feel like in the gym. I wanted to document some of my experiences here in case others might find it helpful. 

Foam rolling has always felt utterly useless. It feels like an OK warmup but doesn't seem to help my flexibility/mobility in any way. 

Old school static stretches just tend to reach a point of pain, where I try to torture myself, and never get anything out of them.

I've found that dynamic stretches work best for me post workout. For example, on a day where I've heavily trained my arms, I will use various stretches for my pecs, triceps, and biceps, using whatever you'd call the method where you gradually increase the amount of stretch by ""bouncing"" against the muscles.I do not mean an aggressive bounce with a large range of motion, or even a fast bounce. I'll elaborate specifically for squats below, but I'll say here that the bounce is in a fraction of the overall range of motion and I've never performed it with weights exceeding about 2/3 my max.  I know that's fairly common for some types of stretches, I've found it works great for all of them, and lets me turn static stretches into dynamic ones and actually get results.

It call came down to forced stretches. As squatting got heavier on the SL5x5 progression, I noticed that at some point in the high 100s, if I paused a rep, I could feel myself sinking into the hole, stretching, feeling pull in my joints and muscles. I began doing these paused squats pretty regularly, just 2-3 of them, during my 5x5, and within weeks I was naturally sinking deeper into my normal squat reps. 

I've since found lots of ways to get forced stretches on various muscles at various angles, and have made them a regular part of training. Here are some examples of how I work them in on a 5/3/1 squat day

1. Before squatting, some very briefly dynamic stretches for my hips, basically swinging them in and out, back and forth, as far as I can, for a few seconds each.
2. During all my warmup reps, pause the squats (and do them all high bar for better depth), but not like a ""paused squat"" for training purposes, but simply drop into the bottom of the squat and let yourself sink as deep as you can. At warmup weights coming out of these squats isn't challenging. When I'm as deep as I can get in the hole on the first few, I will gently bounce my hips just a little. I'll feel a great extra stretch. I'm talking about maybe my hips coming up 0.5-1"" then dropping back to the bottom.
3. After my back squat warmup, I do front squats with modest weight, low rep sets, normal execution. I find that this sequence leaves all my joints feeling warm and flexible, including my shoulders, hips, knees, etc.
4. Perform my 5/3/1 work sets normally
5. Perform my BBB sets
6. Perform a set at about 40% of my max for 4-5 reps as I did in warmup, sinking as deeply into the hole as possible for a few seconds, then squatting out of it.

This has worked wonders for my knees, which are slow to warm and have some funky cartilage issues. It's also done wonders for overall hip mobility in a non-warmed up, not at the gym state. 

I do things like this with all my lifts, if anyone is interested I can write up some more. Hopefully this isn't all old news useless info to you guys!",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1357581878.0,,,True,t3_162yrm,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/162yrm/observations_on_my_mobility_work/,

Last week we talked about [Korte 3x3](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/xtoor/training_tuesdays/) and a list of previous Training Tuesdays topics can be found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/weightroom#TrainingTuesdaysDiscussions)

This week's topic is:

&gt; The Press

* What methods have you found to be the most successful for press programming?
* Are there any programming methods you've found to work poorly for the press?
* What accessory lifts have improved your press the most?

Feel free to ask other training and programming related questions as well, as the topic is just a guide.

* Starting Strength: Nov 29, 2010 - March 4, 2011
* Texas Method: March 4, 2011 - present

Last Saturday (May 12, 2012) I competed in my first powerlifting meet. It was the 100% Raw Powerlifting Federation ""Ontario Open Championships.""

Competed in the 90Kg/198.4lbs class.

I'm 5'4"" and normally walk around 200lbs, so I only had to cut about 2lbs. However I wanted to try out water loading and a hot bath to see how it would work. Ended up dropping to 87.9Kg/193.9lbs at the weigh in, which was held the night before. I think next time I'll try dropping down to the 82.5Kg/181.9lbs weight class.

Didn't get much sleep the night before (didn't bring my CPAP machine so my snoring constantly woke me up. Plus my hotel was located on a busy and noisy street) so I felt like crap all day.

**Results:**

* Squat: 220Kg/485lbs
* Bench Press: 140Kg/308.6lbs
* Deadlift: 187.5Kg/402.3lbs
* Total: 542.5Kg/1195.9955lbs

I had to leave early because I had to catch a Greyhound bus that would take me home (I live 1 hr away from the meet location) so I passed on the last 2 deadlift attempts. Also my lower back has been bothering me for weeks, and was aching after deadlift warmups up to 315lbs, so I lowered my opener from 210Kg/463lbs to 182.5Kg/402.3lbs.

Full report with videos and some pics here: http://www.johnphung.com/blog/2198/my-first-100-raw-powerlifting-meet/

**Future Plans**

* Probably going to try Smolov squat routine in a few weeks
* Bought an inversion table which should arrive next week. I hope this lives up to the claims and user experiences I've read
* Get leaner so it will be easier to cut to a lower weight class
* Train more often with paused bench
* Get my deadlift up
* Cut off my squat at the right height (just below parallel) in preparation for a meet. (I'll still squat as low as I can while I train)",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1337344466.0,,,True,t3_tt3ll,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/tt3ll/meet_report_m_32_54_90kg1984lbs_100_raw/,

**Backstory**: In September I ran a smolov jr bench cycle and hit a 20lb pr at 247lbs. Following that I began to get sick and lose weight which culminated in the beginning of december when I found out I was bleeding internally. I lost roughly 25lbs of bodyweight from the time of my pr to when I started recovering. After gaining a bit of weight back and starting creatine I entered the cycle weighing 230 and being able to bench 215. 

**The cycle**: Knowing that I would be able to gain some rebound strength back quickly I started my programming with a 235 1rm to generate my numbers. I used a custom spreadsheet similar to [this one](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnYgzBT6dbEldFg1UVRMS2JHUTgybFNPaVA0aG5pMmc) for generating my daily workouts. My workouts were also placed as Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. I struggled to finish the first week but could tell the strength was coming back. The following week I took a jump of 15lbs and actually started finishing stronger than the first week. The next week I was skiing so I took the entire week off and rested. The following two weeks I increased by 5lbs each week so my final day was 225lbs for ten triples. I only missed one rep the entire cycle and it was on week 4 day 4 in the ninth set. After finishing the week I took another entire week off because of medical appointments and Easter.

**Results**: Finally I was able to test my new 1rm, I was feeling a little sore after having done some heavy clean and jerk a couple days before but felt fine benching. After warming up with , 45x10, 135x5, 185x3 I began doing singles. 225 and 245 were fast so I jumped to 265 and nailed it. I then went for 275 and just missed. Reset for 270 and hit it better than 265. I wanted to try for 275 again but by now my shoulders were done and I called it a day. The final result was still VERY pleasing to me, a tested 55lb increase in 4 weeks of benching and 2 rest weeks. During this period my bodyweight went from 230 to 240 and there was a noticeable change in chest size. I plan on taking a couple more weeks rest and planning out my next program from there.

1323128053.0,41,self.weightroom,n1qki,The truth about Pendlay Rows,Nevr2Big,43,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/n1qki/the_truth_about_pendlay_rows/,"Ok, fellas (and ladies)... I've been seeing a lot of people talking about Pendlay rows and I'm afraid there is a lot of misunderstanding about both how they are to be performed (as evidenced by many of the piss-poor examples on youtube and SOME of the descriptions here) and what they are supposed to accomplish.
Here's the description written by the man himself; hopefully it will clear up some of the confusion about how to do this exercise and it's benefit.

""Rows: Well, the best way to do them is to start with the bar on the floor every single rep. Your middle back will have slight bend to it. You pull the bar off the floor quickly with the arms, and by a powerful arch of your middle back. You finish by touching the bar to your upper stomach or middle stomach. At no time is there any movement of the hips or knees, no hip extension at all, all that bends is the middle back and the shoulders and elbows.

This is hard to do and you have to have good muscular control to do it, or you'll end up straightening up at the hips along with the arching of the back. But if you can master doing them this way you will get a big back. This works because the lats actually extend (arch) the middle back in addition to other functions, just like with glute-ham extensions compared to leg curls you always get a stronger contraction when you move both the origin and insertion of a muscle, flexing it from both ends so to speak.

The bar returns to the floor after each rep. The bent row is actually best done as an explosive movement and the bar is moved fast. I have trained many people who could do this exercise with 350 or more lbs. I myself have done reps with 425, Ed Coan, who also knows how to do them properly, has done reps with over 500lbs without his back ever coming above parallel with the ground. That is stronger than Dorian Yates or Ronnie Coleman, by the way.""

Here's the takeaway points as I see it and have performed it since 2003:

1. No/minimal hip, knee extension.
2. Lower back is locked into extension (though it will look flat-ish from a side view.
3. The mid back (upper lumbar and thoracic areas) WILL be in flexion the rest position (hanging down).
4. Execute the lift by simultaneously flexing the mid and upper back while pulling the weight up to lower abdomen. At the top your back will take on a sort of flattened ""U"" shape (extension from top to bottom).
5. (most important!!!) Ignore the 175 lb ""trainer"" with the faux hawk telling you you'll need to keep your back perfectly still while doing a row. If you want to be nice to him, since it is his job to be helpful after all, you can offer to let him rack the 275+ lbs off your bar when done. That'll be more lifting volume than he's gotten all week, most likely.

Just some words from a (beginning to feel old) vet, no warranties, express or implied.

1374076973.0,39,self.weightroom,1ihqx5,I found this cool video analysis tool that I wanted to share! :),Anders85,48,9,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1ihqx5/i_found_this_cool_video_analysis_tool_that_i/,"It is a free open source video analysis tool called Kinovea.  
Downloadable here: http://www.kinovea.org/  
  
The features that I've found especially cool are the automatic bar tracker and speed measurements. 

Let us say you have two videoes where you max out on deadlifts. For the sake of the example the video is shot from the side. Then you are able to put a marker on your barbell collar and it will automatically track the bar path. You can now easliy see if you arnt pulling in a straight line. For an experienced lifter it might not be that usefull but for a beginner it is a nice virtualization tool. It also makes it easier to compare you form if you are trying to make changes, elite or amateur. 

Anyway, you also have the speed measurements. All you need is a reference point in the image and it will calculate the speed of the barbell from point A to B. Why is this usefull? Let us say that you are training a westside barbell type program, you are maxing out regulary on the same weights but you dont really know if you are improving or not. With this tool you will be able to know if you 500lbs deadlift is lifted faster this week compared to the previous one.. Cool? I think so!  

I have not had the time to play that much with it yet, but I think it has alot of possibilities. I think it should be possible to get a hard data showing if you are improving your explosiveness in certain parts of the lifts too ergo. evening out sticky points that you are working on.  
  
**Edit:**  
You also have a little more advanced software that maybe is more usefull for weakness analysis. Freeware ofcourse.  It's the same Mike Tucherer uses for himself and his trainees.

##Pre-Meet    
I decided to do this meet about 2 months before the meet. I had been running Wendler 5/3/1 for about 4 months at that point. I haven't done a meet in about 6 years, and just decided I missed it. This was the closest meet to me this year, and I had never lifted in the NASA before, but I decided to just go for it. I bought my bench shirt about a month out, which turned out to be a huge mistake. The squat suit I used was one I had laying around from high school. I used an Inzer lever belt and some Inzer Iron Wrap Z knee wraps. I had already been cutting for about a month when I decided to do the meet, and was about 235 pounds at that point. A week before the meet I was sitting at 229 and had to cut pretty hard to make weight. The day of the meet I didn't eat or drink anything, and ended up making weight by .1 lbs. I weighed in at 220.1. I'm pretty sure cutting that much hurt me quite a bit, and looking forward I will try to stay as close to competition weight as possible. 

##Meet Day    
This was my first experience with the NASA federation, so I didn't really know what to expect. They had one platform going for everyone, and 3 flights on most lifts. The atmosphere was a little different than I remembered from high school, but everyone was really nice. I competed in the 220 lb Equipped Junior Division, and was the only competitor in my class.  
**Squat**    
I set my opening lift super low because I was nervous and just wanted to be sure I could do it with no stress. The only warmup I got was 225x5 because I waited too long and the flight moved faster than I was expecting, but my first lift went as planned \- super light. The State Record in my Division was 501 lbs, so I broke it on my second attempt of 507. That felt pretty light as well, so I went to 540 which would have been an all time PR for me. I got the lift, but I got called up just a tad early by my brother. It was definitely a doable weight, and I should have gone lower and gotten it.  

**Bench**    
Like I said, I only got my bench shirt about a month before the meet, and wasn't confident with it yet so I decided to do a super light raw first lift. The record in my division for bench was 375, so I was hoping to beat this one as well. 320 went up as planned, so I went to what I knew I could do in my shirt fairly easy, 408 lbs. I got the weight, but my butt came off the bench so I was red lighted. I stayed with the same weight for my 3rd attempt, and I focused on slamming my butt into the bench throughout the lift. I was pretty confident that I got it, but got 2 reds for my butt coming off again. This is the lift I was most disappointed with, because I had gotten 425 in the gym before. Either way, I had to kind of shake things off and get ready for deadlift.  

**Deadlift**    
Deadlift is by far my most comfortable lift, and the only one that I am somewhat happy with. I hadn't deadlifted in a squat suit before, so I picked another easy opener at 540 lbs. Got it pretty easily, and decided to break the record of 567 lbs for my second attempt of 573. It was a bit of a struggle, but I was still feeling pretty strong. Attempted 601 for my 3rd but just couldn't finish the lockout. I had gotten 600 in the gym about a month prior to the meet, but I weighed between 230 and 235 at that time, so the cutting probably hurt me here.  

##Post-Meet    
I was pretty mad at myself overall with this meet. I did set some meet PR's, but I kind of felt robbed with my squat and bench. If I would have just gotten my bench press my total would have been almost 90 pounds heavier. I got first in my division, although I was the only lifter ha. I did set 2 state records, but I feel like I could have set all 4. I will definitely try to stick to my competition weight for the next meet, seeing as cutting probably affected me quite a bit. I also need much more practice in my bench shirt. All in all, I'm glad that I went but it just made me want to do so much better.  

If anyone knows of any meets coming near North Texas soon, let me know! I checked powerliftingwatch.com but there weren't really any more listed besides a push-pull meet in September.

Went 9/9 with a 457.5lb (207.5kg) squat, 314.2lb (142.5kg) bench, and 529.1lb (240kg) DL. 1300.8lb (590kg) total. (Sorry, I don’t have any video of the lifts. I forgot to have anyone film them for me).

***Background:***

•	Started lifting semi seriously in May 2011. Half assed Starting Strength for a while until I got bored of it then I tried to move onto 5/3/1. Going from half assing starting strength to half assing 5/3/1 didn’t go well at all and I lost a lot of ground on all of my lifts. At this point I got frustrated and pretty much stopped lifting for most of Nov and Dec 2011. I finally got my act together and went back to full ass starting strength Jan 2012 and hit it hard until I stalled out proper in March 2012. At that point I wasn’t too fond of going back on 5/3/1 and none of the other intermediate programs looked fun so, against my better judgment, I decided to give Sheiko a shot. Sheiko beat the ever loving shit out of me and I was perpetually sore, but I loved every minute of it. I ran Sheiko all the way from March to Oct 2012. In Oct I had to deal with some pretty major stuff (surgery, back problems, life changing family issues) so my lifting took a back seat to everything else. I had basically stopped lifting at that point. I didn’t get back into lifting until January of this year when I moved for work and started lifting at Detroit Barbell. I train with a crew there and the owner (Clay Brandenburg) tells me exactly what to do, so I just listen to him for my training now. 

•	This was my first meet. I had been trying to find a meet for a long time, but with school and work and the amount of travel I would have had to do to get to any of them I’d never had a chance to do it. We (Detroit Barbell) put the meet on, so it was pretty much perfect for my first. 

***Pre-meet training and weigh-in:***

Like I said, Clay does all of the thinking for me in my training and I do what he says. I worked up to all my openers a week and a half before and just took it real easy in between. Only light upper back work and some easy leg stuff leading up the meet. 
As far as my weight goes, I was told I wouldn’t be cutting since this was my first meet and to keep doing what I was doing. So the plan was for me to compete in the 242 weight class since I had been holding pretty steady around 230 for a while. It was a 24hr weigh in and I made weight by a long shot at 228.4lb.

***Lifts***

Going in I knew what my openers would be, but I didn’t know what my follow up attempts would be. Couple of my training partners were doing all of the calling for me, so I didn’t need to think about it. I honestly didn’t even know how much weight was on the bar until after. 

**Squat:** 

	407.9lb (185kg)

	435.4lb (197.5kg)

	457.5lb (207.5kg)

Not disappointed with my performance, but this didn’t go quite as well as I had hoped. Warm ups felt good and my hips and back (normally my weak points) were feeling pretty good going in. First attempt felt a little bit heavier than I had hoped it would, but it still went up quick so I was alright with it. Second attempt felt ok, but it went up much slower than I would have liked. Going into my third I wasn’t really feeling great, but I was ready either way. I got my hands and shoulders chalked and took a big hit of nose tork. Immediately following the nose tork one of my training partners took it upon himself to get me amped up in his own special way. I got the hardest (surprise) slap to the face that I have ever had in my entire life. That got me ready to go and I went for my third. My third was the longest grinder I have ever experienced in my entire life. It took a solid 10 seconds to go from the hole to lock out. I thought for sure they were going to take it from me several times, but they let me keep going and I ground it out. Going in I was hoping I would get another 10 or 20lbs on squat, but it just wasn’t there. I couldn’t have even done another 5lbs. 

**Bench:**

	264.6lb (120kg)

	286.6lb (130kg)

	314.2lb (142.5kg)

I wasn’t real confident going into bench, so I started low to make sure I would at least get something. As it turns out, I waaaay underestimated where my strength was at and left a ton of weight on the platform. First attempt went up so easy that it may as well have been a warm up. Spotters and judges (all of whom I knew) actually laughed at how easy it was. Second attempt was pretty much the same. I was a little bit apprehensive going in to my third because I was told it was a pretty big jump, but it still went up easy. This is surprising to me now because 1) I haven’t touched anything higher than 285lb since I hit my last PR in Oct 2012 and 2) my last PR was 315lb which was pretty rough when I did it. Next time I’ll open up higher and hopefully hit a big PR.

**Deadlift:**

	457.5lb (207.5kg)

	501.5lb (227.5kg)

	529.1lb (240kg)

Went about as well as I thought they would go, although I think I could have gotten another 10 or 15lbs out of it. All three pulls went up smoothly without too much issue. I think I could have ground out 540lb (245kg).

**Overall:**

Went 9/9 on all my lifts for a 1300.8lb (590kg) total. Not too shabby for my first meet. 

***Comments:***

I had a ton of fun and I look forward to my next meet (probably APF Nationals in May). It was really nice that it was a meet put on by my gym so I know and regularly lift with all of the spotters and judges. That took some of the pressure off. Having a group of people who know what’s going on and can coach and help is huge, especially for a first meet. A big thanks to everyone on here who has helped me through my whole journey into lifting (you all know who you are). I probably would have given up a long time ago if it weren’t for you assholes.

The main focus of Training Tuesdays will be programming and templates, but once in a while we'll stray from that for other concepts.

Last week we talked about [training the chest and triceps](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/134aoi/training_tuesdays/) and a list of previous Training Tuesdays topics can be found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/weightroom#TrainingTuesdaysDiscussions)

This week's topic is:

 

&gt; Training the Legs: Hamstrings, Quads, Glutes

 

* What volume, intensity, frequency, rest, and other training variables levels have you found to be most useful and effective to you for training your legs?

* For what goal have these methods been most useful for you to achieve? Goals will likely include hypertrophy, strength, or carryover to another lift or goal such as powerlifting, gymnastics, fighting, etc.

* Whatever your goals, tell us how, and in what way, training your legs has helped you achieve them.

* Reddit shit the bed last week and made the chest/triceps topic a flop. Feel free to talk about those this week too.

 

Feel free to ask other training and programming related questions as well, as the topic is just a guide.

I lift Monday Wednesday and Friday using a two week cycle

W- Squat 3x5, Ram bench 3x as many as I can
F- Sumo 3x as many as I can, bench 5x5
Then it repeats with 10 more pounds on the bar for each lift each day.  

When I start training in gear again the schedule will probably be the same and all of the heavy 'as many as I can' days will turn into gear days.  I'm 23, I've been lifting since I was 13 and competing in powerlifting since I was 18.  My competition total has gone from 1200-1445 in that time, hopefully at my next meet I'll break 1500.  

Long term goals are:
1607 raw
1785 single ply both in USAPL
and to win a national level meet someday.  Almost certainly in gear because my raw strength isn't there and once I get my shirt/deadlift suit technique down I think I can put up some decent numbers.  

More interestingly, I work in a human performance lab with both exercise physiologists and biomechanics who are all into lifting.  So I can hopefully provide some summaries of research and stuff like that, or maybe explain why this or that paper is not relevant to a lifter's actual programming.  If anyone has any ideas for research please tell me because the more I propose the better I look and the better place I can go for my phD :D.

Currently I am working on a proposal where I will compare the bar paths/EMG activity/velocities and stuff of different percentages in the conventional and sumo deadlift, to try to determine a bottom range of effectiveness.  Does pulling at 60% have enough in common with a 100% deadlift to even be the same exercise?  Are the mechanical and (hopefully next study) physiological adaptations you will make going to carryover to competition?  I'm not a great lifter or coach so I'm hoping what I can hope to bring to this table is the ability to access/read obnoxious amounts of research,

Anyways thats me, I'm sure I violated the format sent to me by xtc46 and for that I'm sorry.

1370712340.0,39,self.weightroom,1fxnkd,Modified Sheiko review,raingoat,52,13,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1fxnkd/modified_sheiko_review/,"I just finished a run of modified Sheiko using #29,#37 and #32 and figured I'd share my experience with /r/weightroom

For those that aren't familiar with Sheiko, it is a volume heavy program that runs with most sessions where you hit one lift twice (usually deadlift or squat) and then one lift once (the press) per session and is 3 times a week. This means including warmups I did over 1600 reps of squats, over 2200 reps of overhead press, around 500 reps of deadlifts and 400 of bench press for a little over 420 tons of combined volume between these 4 lifts which accounts for close to half the total volume of the program.

Having fallen into a somewhat of a rut with programs and needing something that was fairly low intensity but could help me kill immense amounts of time in the gym Sheiko is what came through for me.

Bodyweight went from 123.9kg to 125.7kg with the following improvements to my lifts:

* Squat - 225kg to 245kg (+20kg)

* Bench press - 150kg to 160kg (+10kg)

* Deadlift - 255kg to 270kg (+20kg)

* Overhead press - 107.5kg to 115kg (+7.5kg)

* Front squat - 160kg to 190kg (+30kg)

With both the Overhead press and Front squat being tested about a week after the big 3 and at a BW of 124.5kg

I ran the following cycles #29 - #37 - #32 which are best described as introductory - volume- peaking. But also since I can't run anything without tinkering with it I made the following substitutions and changes:

* Bench was exchanged for Overhead Press
* Dumbbell fly's were exchanged with Lying Triceps Extensions
* Dips &amp; Overhead Press were exchanged for Bench
* Lunges were exchanged for Bulgarian Split squats
* Powercleans using a modified 5/3/1 scheme as Deadlift warmup.
* Superset every set of presses with 10 reps of band pullaparts

I was also advised to add back work which I did as it has a appalling lack of it compared to pressing. As the bulk of my pressing was vertical I also made the bulk of my back work vertical and used the following scheme for 3-5x10:

* Monday - Underhand lat pulldowns 
* Wednesday - Chest supported rows
* Friday - Lat pulldowns

For most of the cycle the Bench press got treated as assistance when It came up but I focused on hitting it fairly hard each time when it came around leaving me with a few rep PR's in the progress.
As for the rows and LTE's I focused on weights which were heavy but allowed me to hit all reps with decent form.

The main drawback of Sheiko I've found is that it's very intense on the low back leaving me often with a nasty low back pump and a need for excessively long sessions initially as the first sessions took just over 3 hours but it got worked down to meager 2 hour sessions as my work capacity rose and I adapted to the constant pump.

After running #29 I had to take ~10 days off as I was travelling leaving me feeling fresh when I got back into the gym and got rid of a good deal of aches that had accumulated due to being lazy with the prehab &amp; mobility work. Then due to school obligations I stretched #37 over 5 weeks leaving me with a smaller peak than expected as my accumulation had been too restful.

My advice for anyone that intends to run this is the following:

* Don't skimp on your foamrolling and mobility work, I did and paid for it in achy joints and constant low back pum after the first few weeks.
* Program some heavy upper and mid back work to offset the pressing and make sure it's not your weak link
* Program your maxes about 5% higher than your actual maxes if you aren't totalling elite or close to it
* Deload properly before starting the program it self and don't go into it with any aches or niggles as they will only amplify
* Eat a lot of good food and sleep as much as you can.

In conclusion, If you have plenty of time, enjoy high volume but low reps (never above 5 reps unless it's assistance) and want some very good gains then go for it but be warned, it's tough.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_1fxnkd,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1fxnkd/modified_sheiko_review/,

I then continued training at a local gym and then started to look into powerlifting.  I found a gym that specialized in strongman and powerlifting and I started working out there in October.

Raw division, 198 pound weight class, 193.4 pounds body weight, 36 years old, 6 foot tall

Best lifts: 195kg squat, 110kg bench press, 227.5kg deadlift, for a total of 532.5kg

(429 pounds squat, 242 pounds bench, 502 pounds deadlift, for a total of 1174 pounds)

Had to wake up at 6:15am to do the one hour drive to the venue, because I couldn’t get weighed in the day before. Arrived at 8am and was one of the first lifters on location. Weighed in at 193.4 if I recall correctly. There was a bit of confusion whether my polyester t-shirt was legal, but Alan, the guy who wrote the USPA rule book, was on site and clarified. As long as it’s a loose fitting t-shirt, it’s fine.

My strategy was to use my third attempts of my last meet in October as starting weights, then my recent gym PRs as second attempts, and add 10-15 pounds to that for my third attempts. It turned out this was again too conservative. It felt heavy, but when I look at the video, it looks almost effortless. I guess this means I should push myself more at the gym to find out my true limits. It’s weird, in the last weeks I missed 215 pound benches, barely made 225 pounds, and in the meet I easily hit 242 pounds. I probably underestimate the fatigue caused by the working sets I do before doing heavy singles (running 5/3/1 for powerlifting).

Before the last deadlift, I thought “I don’t want to go 9 for 9 again, I need to push myself a little more and miss a lift! Eff it, I’m adding 40 pounds and going for 500 pounds!” It felt heavy to get it off the floor, but then it went up like nothing. Really surprising. Makes me wonder what I could have done if I would have been as bold at the squats.

Overall, another great USPA meet. Great judges, very helpful, no ego trips. There was an incident with another lifter, where a spotter grabbed the bar too early on bench press, and the head judge let him repeat the attempt without much arguing. He got the lift on the do-over.

Best part of the day though was that I got to spend it with a cute girl that ended up deadlifting 315 pounds at 120 pounds body weight. :D",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_189g6v,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/189g6v/meet_report_uspa_west_coast_open_5325kg_877kg_bw/,

I will be traveling a lot this semester and in the summer and want to adapt for the time being to a routine that can be done a) at gyms w/o bumper plates and platforms, and b) in much less time than my typical olympic lifting routines. The latter for me just means switching over to the usual push/pull pavel 3-5 guidelines w/ no olympic lifting.

I want to keep front squatting and back squatting, because I fucking love squatting, but I also want to deadlift, because I love deadlifting. However I'm not really sure how to incorporate this into a routine. I'll shut up now and just tell you what I was planning:


Workout A (all 3x5):

Deadlift
Front Squat
Overhead Press

Workout B (3x5): 

Back Squat (olympic style)
Weighted Pullups
Weighted Dips


Would front squats and back squats be better of if I switched them around? It seems to me that front squats would be easier to do on the same day as deads because of the focus on the quads, however I like to deadlift w/ weightlifting shoes on rippetoe style and that alone puts more emphasis on the quads.

What do you guys think? I appreciate any comments or criticisms

edit: forgot to mention I'll be doing light cardio (probably swimming or cycling) 2-3 times a week, in between resistance training, if that affects anything. Also I'm going to be on a caloric deficit: I'm going to france during the summer and would be really disappointed if I didn't snag some french pussy.

* 186cm (+1cm from last meet :o), 87.4kg., 17 Years Old
* Training 4-5x a week since January 2
* Train for olympic lifting primarily (I also do high-school only PL meets)
* Second WL Meet (2 PL meets under my belt as well)
* Paleo from January to about June, now I eat primarily Paleo with some additional carb sources (Oats, some bread, rice etc) edit: also whole milk
* Multivite, Vit D, Vit C daily, Optimum Platnium Pre before each workout
* I've been training so hard to try and get a 211kg or 215kg to qualify for Nationals or Provincials and I end up entering the competition with a 191kg training total, I'll get it next year!


**Meet Prep**

* Not a huge amount of prep for this meet, didn't need to cut weight, though I could have been an 85, I decided it's not worth dropping the weight for a short-term goal like this meet
* Cooked a simple rice + sweet potato mix the night before to chow on after weigh ins.
* Brought some bananas to snack on too, food seems to pass through my stomach quickly, my regular preworkout meal is 1c oats, 1c blueberries drizzled in honey 30 min before I go to the gym (45m before lifting)


**The Lifts**	

Went 2/6 on my lifts, only hitting my openers, and missing a *questionable* C&amp;J

[Video of all 6 lifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKfw4jzb9GY)

**Snatch**

* 77kg - my opener, training PR is 84.5kg, I am not very tight at the bottom of either snatch or C&amp;J and I need to work on this
* 81kg - my other weakness is not fully extending and having to chase the bar forward
* 81kg - no lift, the nerves really got the better of me during warmup and the competition lifts.

**Clean and Jerk**

* 98kg - training PR is 107kg. felt good, been using a narrow clean grip &amp; popping it out wide at the top recently and it's been working well.
* 102kg - I think I missed this b/c I kept my front foot forward for too long after the jerk, crappy way to miss a lift
* 107kg - pressout


**Results**

Walked out with a **175kg total** and (Technically) the #1 Junior in my class, the other junior lifter (J. B. Spencer - Ontarios actual #1 junior) bombed out and went 1/6. Happy to hit a 200+ sinclair in compeition, disappointed I nearly bombed out though.

**Records**

Broke no PRs or federation records

**Final Thoughts**

* Pretty disappointed in myself
* I was really working on getting a more consistent snatch and my nerves really messed with my head during that part of the compeition
* Next WL meet is February 9

Welcome to Training Tuesdays, the weekly weightroom training thread.  The main focus of Training Tuesdays will be programming and templates, but once in a while we'll stray from that for other concepts.

Last week we talked about [squats](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/t1i7p/training_tuesdays/) and a list of previous Training Tuesdays topics can be found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/weightroom#TrainingTuesdaysDiscussions)

This week's topic is:

&gt; The Bench Press


* What methods have you found to be the most successful for bench programming?
* Are there any programming methods you've found to work poorly for the bench?
* What accessory lifts have improved your bench the most?


Feel free to ask other training and programming related questions as well, as the topic is just a guide.

Did you join a club, pay for a coach, or trial-and-error it on your own?

Fortunately, I'm starting at a new University in the fall that offers a small-group intro to Oly lifting course (of which I intend on taking full advantage). However, if this didn't exist, there is a slim possibility that I'd seriously consider taking on this new style of lifting due to the costs of professional coaching and accessibility of a quality gym.

Also, any interesting tips/anecdotes/etc. from those who transitioned from powerlifting to oly lifts would be interesting. ",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_qt157,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qt157/oly_lifters_how_did_you_get_into_olympic/,

This week, lets pay our respects to Jim Wendler.

If anyone here doesn't know who Jim Wendler is, you are in for a treat.

[This](http://www.elitefts.com/images/PICTURES/yoke.jpg) is Jim Wendler.

Jim Wendler is probably best known around /r/weightroom as the creator of [5/3/1: The Simplest and Most Effective Training System for Raw Strength](http://www.flexcart.com/members/elitefts/default.asp?m=PD&amp;cid=114&amp;pid=2976). There are also several variations of the program including one for powerlifting and one for beginners. If you are doing 5/3/1 or want to do 5/3/1 do yourself a favor and buy the book. 

I have lifted weights off and on for about 10 years now (played football, and trained in that, did the usual bro routines, did starting strength, did some westside template stuff, etc). 5/3/1 is the best program I have ever done. It is flexible enough to fit my schedule and my goals, and simple enough that I can put as much or as little though into my workouts as I want and still leave the gym having done something useful.

His training philosophies are simple and come down to not worrying about the details and just do the fucking work.

In addition to sitting around and writing some books, he has also done the following during his career:

* Played football for the University of Arizona
* Strength and Conditioning Coach for the University of Kentucky
* Squatted 1000lbs
* Benched 675lbs
* Deadlifted 700lbs
* 2375lb combined total in the 275lb weight class.
* EliteFTS.com Senior Editor, Q/A Staff, and Sales Manager
* T-Nation Writer
* Author \ Owner of http:\\www.jimwendler.com

As you can see, the man knows his shit, and has done well in making sure he has passed that hard earned knowledge on to the rest of us.

His [Blood and Chalk](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/klxy2/blood_and_chalk_the_compendium/) series is filled with valuable information, and is required reading as far as I am concerned.

His [Elite FTS](http://articles.elitefts.com/tag/jim-wendler/) writing is also very informative.

and his [T-Nation](http://www.t-nation.com/searchResults.jsp?cx=016420786931182441572%3Akswwmllusns&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=jim+wendler&amp;siteurl=www.t-nation.com%2Fstrength-training-topics%2F1434) articles are funny and awesome.

Scheduling meets 3-4 months apart has been great for building some confidence and getting some experience with meets in general. This next time I'm looking to double the amount of time...probably looking to compete again in November, which will hopefully be enough time to make some significant increases to my lifts. The last meet was in December - I totalled 1175, barely missing my last deadlift which would have set me up at 1200, so the goal this time was to capture the total and try to PR the lifts. I didn't realize that this time around would actually be competitive, and that new element made things more interesting, which I enjoyed.  
  
**[Making Weight]**   
Wasn't too much of a problem. I had been bulking up for a strongman meet which happneed the weekend  
before this one. I had gone from about 194 to 202 over 6 weeks, but weighed in at 200 at the strongman meet. I was at 199.5 the day before this one, and then I forgot to bring a scale to the hotel (oops). I had a small dinner and didn't drink much, but I was still worried so I took two 30 minute hot ass bath sessions. Weighed in at 195.5, so it was all good. 
  
**[Meet]**  
**Squat:**  
**408 - 3 whites** ... Felt good  
**[435.5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkGb--4gKn4) - 3 whites** ... Heavy, but felt good. Thought I had more in me. (Tied PR)  
**[445](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j7eSYxMzqQ) - 3 reds** ... This was a fight, and I feel like I should have made it... if I had to pick a reason besides being weak, I'd say I went too slow.  
  
At this point I was tied for second out of nine, however pretty far behind first place.  
  
**Bench:**  
**[246](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgb9YWo1GWM) - 3 whites** ... A breeze.  
**[264](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iukmtHoad_Y) - 3 whites** ... The cursed number. My bench has been stuck here for a long ass time.  
**[275.5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGRpRcjFGxg) - 3 whites** ... Curse exorcised. Will be sticking to the programming I kind of slapped together four weeks out and see if the gains keep coming. (10lb PR)  
  
There were some pretty huge benches going on. (375 for first place, 365 second, etc). I was in third and hoping to keep that spot.  
  
  **Deadlift:**  
**450 - 3 whites** ... Pretty easy. Video only captured the last second so I skipped uploading it.  
**[490](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmn54L4WT2U) - 3 whites** ... A strategic choice. I chose to go with 490 to secure the 1200 total.  
I wanted to go for 500, but it was 10lbs more than I needed and thus an unnecessary risk. (15lb PR)  
**[500](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weTIjYdyYPA) - 3 reds** ... After the last attempt I knew I wouldn't make this one. I tried anyway because why not. 
   
Finished 4th out of 9. The guy behind me stepped up and crushed a 540lb deadlift, passing up my total. Still, I don't   
think 4th is too shabby. The first place dude was somewhere in the 1400s, and my buddy Alex took second with 1273.   
Congrats to all those guys.   
  
**[Future Plans]**  
Today I started the Texas Method and I plan to stick to it for the next 12 weeks. It's a long shot but I'd like to total  
1300+ this year and squat 500. I'm also looking forward to the prospect of more bench gains... would love to bench 3 plates this year. Also, getting into OLY is a smaller goal this year. I'm getting started with a Pendlay seminar in two weeks.

I was just thinking about this last night.  
Why don't they have safeties (at least for bench) at any powerlifting meets?  
  
A lot of the failed benches I see, the spotters don't react in time when it's a catastrophic failure (grip failing and bar slamming down on chest/neck/face).

After some searching, I haven't seen anything that looks like a real response, but people theorizing why they may not be there. These are the most common, and my thoughts on each:

* Pinch points created - *The most likely explanation from my POV*
* Would have to adjust safeties for every lifter - *They do this for weights/rack heights, seems like a weak answer*
* Some guys are too wide for the safeties in gear - *If they can unrack it, they can have safeties*
* At high weights you'd break the pins - *They use stronger bars/equipment at meets because people are lifting heavy singles, why not just have stronger pins*

As I said it's mainly on bench I was curious about, but watching someone fail a squat and get crushed is just as bad with some of the weights these guys are working with.

I'm also not saying to get rid of the spotters, but I've having a safety bar has to make it a bit safer, right?

My PRs are a 500lb deadlift, 405lb squat, 210x5 bench, and a 180 press at a bodyweight of around 220, so I'm not exactly a high-level lifter.  Over this time, I've suffered from a lower back injury (with several recurrences), a strained rotator cuff, elbow tendonitis, hip flexor tendonitis, and a mysterious undiagnosed ankle injury.  None of these injuries were incredibly serious, but they all continue to cause me problems.  My lower back hurts if I sit for too long, lie on my back, or lift without extensive mobility work.  My rotator cuff hurts if I use a mouse for too long, hold a book without support, or bench with less than perfect form.  My elbows hurt when I use a computer for too long or do any kind of pullups/rows with a straight bar.  My hip flexors hurt when I sit for too long or do any kind of running.  My ankle hurts when I sit for too long, run, or jump rope.

This post isn't intended to be some kind of sob story, but I wonder if my experience is shared by others.  Is there anyone who's been lifting at a decent level for several years and isn't in frequent pain?

When I began lifting 2 years ago as a bench press specialist, I had a dream of a 600lb bench press and a national championship. I wanted these things quickly, I wanted it now. This lead to a few bomb outs, many failures and a few triumphs. I had the USAPL Teen American Record taken from me on three separate occasions because of immaturity and low self confidence. 2012 has been the best year for me yet, as of November I will be starting my third year of competitive lifting and will be lifting at my first worlds because of my win this past weekend in Palm Springs. Consistency is the most important trait, and confidence is the key.

I trained 13 weeks for this meet, with one 'warm up meet' right in the middle. I've never trained this long from one meet, typically my cycles are 6-9 weeks. I sought after a proven bench presser other than my current coach, and received training and programming from him via email (he lives in Illinois and I in Texas) It was brutal, in this Texas Heat and combined with working 2 jobs, I was balls to the wall this whole summer. I had many more downs than ups, there was actually a day I remember towards the end of July where I actually was near the point of tears in the gym and felt like stopping. Finances were tough, 2 jobs was killing me, and training was horrible. I was missing lifts and I was even sick at the same time. I dropped 15 lbs at one point this summer, it effected how my gear fit, how I felt, and how my lifts went. I had a cold for the first month of training and I almost did not make it back to school this semester. I even re-injured my back squatting. I had never been so stressed in my life... But I kept on coming in. I never missed a workout and trained sick,tired,hungry,hungover, defeated and weak. I began doubting myself, which had not happened since a year before. I began seeing myself fail, and lose, and crumble. Not until 3 weeks before the meet did things start changing, I gained my weight back, I enrolled in my classes, my back began feeling better, I ditched the sickness, I began hitting the #'s I had in mind and was progressing slowly. 

I've competed at one other national meet, This years Collegiate Nationals in April, I went 638/556/589. It was the most fun I ever had and I ended up 4th in my class (only my 2nd full power meet ever) Bench Nationals was great, it was in Palm Springs California at the nicest hotel in town. Great venue and set up. I'm going to try and keep this short.

I gained about 4-5lbs before the meet, making my shirts nice and tight, I weighed in at 330lbs, a far cry from the paltry 314 I was 6 weeks earlier. I had 2 meals and about 3 liters of water in me, so strait outta bed after a nice dump I was probably 327. 330 was nice though. I was STRONG. The gameplan going in was this

* Open at a cake number, something I could hit if I miss-grooved it or was held for 5 seconds at the bottom... I chose 529, something I can triple in the gym touch and go, and it would set me up for a nice 17.5-22 kilo jump to my second.
* go for a PR on the second, either 567 or 573. 
* Based on how my second went either go 600 in my new shirt, or 578-584 in the same shirt.

This is how things went-

My last warmup was about 7 min before my opener, I was a little cold and the weight felt a bit heavy in my hands even after my hit of ammonia. I took it down quick right in my groove and blew it up. I called for 567, a number I had been training for all summer. I was warm for my second and fired up. Smooth press and good finish for my long 7 foot wingspan.

Finally after that I went and talked to my handler, we agreed to take 600 for a ride in my new shirt, I had previously only worn it once when I first got it, way too loose like a tshirt in the sleeves. I had to send it back TWICE to get altered, never getting in it again, I brought it with me just in case I wanted to use it on my third.

It was screaming tight in the sleeves, a good fit in the chest panel. we got in on in about 5-8 min, which left enough time for me to rest before taking 600. My handler looked at me after got in on as best we could and said ""alright, lets take it for a ride. see if it will work"". I was surprisingly calm until I was on deck. Wrapping my wrists I went to my dark place, where the demons dance. A buddy of mine from Texas, a 700 lb bencher, came up to me right before and grabbed me by the head, looked me square in the eyes and said "" Alright Ryan, Dont fuck around with it. bring it down and take the squeeze. Take this for a ride and fucking handle it"" That's all I needed to hear. I hit two ammonia caps and controlled my rage. It felt light in my hands, man my shirt sleeves were tight. I took the pain and squeeze and pressed that bitch to my surprise. Sadly the side judges said my butt came up, so no lift, but they cant take that lift from me. I handled 600 under immense pressure, I've only handled it once before in the gym for a 4 board press in September 2011. In the end I finished with a 567 bench and a national title. I will be going to Lithuania next may for worlds and will surely bench over 600.

[Meet Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ow4LKS2RoOM)

Summary:
I scratched and clawed and fought for 13 weeks for 3 lifts. 3 chances at a dream. I failed and missed lifts, I had plenty of possible excuses to not lift, but never gave in. This was the most difficult preparation of my short career, I never lost sight and never gave up. I was consistent in my convictions and finished the fight. I triumphed in the face of adversity, and so can you. It does not take an extraordinary person to do great things, just someone with the want to.

My Next meet is a full power meet in November, Im itching to getting back to squatting and deadlifting heavy. My goals #'s are 650/606/600. Thanks for taking the time to read friends.

It's a fascinating article, but the (relatively) brief summary is that the US sucks at weightlifting because US weightlifters and coaches suck at life. The team, the coaches, and the athletes are constantly making excuses, and have been even as far back as the '50s. Back then it was about how those mean old Commies were jimmying the rules in their own favor. Ten to fifteen years later, it was steroids. The US has this rather hypocritical attitude towards steroids: you're not supposed to use them, because that would be cheating, but if you don't use them, you'll lose, because everyone else is using them. It kind of seems like a martyr complex. Not only does America have a schizophrenic attitude towards steroids, they did not even use them properly then, and probably do not use them properly now by and large. Assuming that the Bulgarian weightlifting team of the '70s was using steroids, as has been alleged by many excuse-makers, they certainly could not have had any better access to steroids than the Russians or the Americans of the time; and yet they closed out the decade with enough medals to open a gift shop. The difference was that the Bulgarians were training with their now-infamous animal-like ferocity on a daily basis, with a definite system of training to work from, while the American lifters had no particular training system whatever, and were not training with anywhere near the volume of the Bulgarians. The Bulgarians seem to have used steroids as they ought to be used; not as a means to bulk up or to build strength, but primarily as a recovery aid.

The other major problem the author sees is a consistent pattern of fear of injury and overtraining in American weightlifting. He refers to many cases where, in contrast to lifters from other countries, American weightlifters aim too low in the name of reservations, in the name of ""saving it for next time."" Rather than start competitions with a heavy, but still manageable weight, say 93% to 95% of their max, American lifters start too light, and will occasionally pass on third attempts if they have already lifted sufficient weight to win. This was a problem as long ago as 1968 when Bob Bednarski, the finest American weightlifter of his day, passed on a chance to put up a history-making 500 pound clean and jerk.

Simply put, we Americans aren't hungry enough for victory. That attitude of aiming only for the bare minimum thought to be needed for victory is not an attitude that will result in world championship victories or gold medals, and until American weightlifters HTFU and start lifting like they mean it, like they want to crush their opponents, like they want not merely a victory but a Roman Triumph, like they want to become legends, we will continue to lose on a regular basis and might as well start cheering for the Bulgarians, the Chinese, or the Russians, or some other country whose competitors actually have fire in their bellies.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,True,,,True,t3_pkef6,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pkef6/why_the_us_sucks_at_weightlifting_yet_another/,

I've been looking this up, because I've been experiencing some dull lower back pain from 3x a week heavy squats.  My technique seems good (based on videos I studied, descriptions form various sites, and the SS book), I wear proper shoes, and deload every 5-6 weeks.  However, I've been going ass to the grass (except maybe last reps once in a while), and thought that's the right way to do it.

What's your take on the parallel only recommendation, and do you think it would likely solve the back pain issue?

My default form has my butt rising faster than my chest out of the hole, whereupon the weight is forced to my back (also glutes?), and I am able to forcibly stand up with the weight. 

When my chest stays high out of the hole, I feel extremely weak. It feels as though all of the effort of the squat is being put into the back/outside part of my leg, with no effort being felt anywhere else in my legs. In addition, I have absolutely no explosive force, just a very very slow grind from ~6 inches out of the hole till I finish standing up.

I assume this is due to putting stress on my legs in ways they're not used to, and my plan was to just keep on grinding it out as I get used to the form. However, the lack of explosiveness bothers me. Its not the speed I'm worried about, but that the contraction itself feels weak.

The guys running the event did a great job, the weather was perfect, and the meet took place during a festival so there was carnival literally steps away.  
	When I signed up, I really only had intentions to go out and have some fun trying the different events, but I wanted to set a goal for myself too. Do at least one rep of everything. Also, I had never tried any of the events before the actual meet. I knew I'd need to work on some areas that I've neglected if I wanted to achieve my goal, so in addition to my current PL training I added more presses, push presses, cleans, and lots of heavier rowing. I'll elaborate more on my training methods after the PL meet I'm doing this weekend. 
	Weighed in at 200 on the dot. No problems here, there was no chance of me falling into a different weight class, but I bulked from 194 starting four weeks out so hopefully I'd be stronger. I was the lightest one in the group by a good bit. I think there were 5 total competitors in the class, and I came fourth. Not last - ~bonus~ 
	Now for the good stuff. There was a 60 second time limit on all events:  

  **Warning**: Turn your volume down if you don't want to hear my screaming parents.  

**[Log Press](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mACKL5ycCIo) - 180lb Clean once press for reps (3 reps)**  

My best strict press is 185, so I thought I'd do a lot better here at first. A log press is different from a strict press though, and IMO it was more difficult. I tried two practice attempts during warm-ups and failed both, so I had changed my mind thinking I wouldn't pull off a single rep. When it came down to it though, shit went down and I managed three reps. The video didn't capture the first rep, unfortunately.

**[Frame Deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2C7TLHVgKo) - 450lb from 16"" for reps (14 reps)**    

Also quite different from regular deadlifting. The frame is basically like a wide-grip trap bar. I tried to see where I'd stand by maxing my rack pull a few weeks ago and topped out right at 450 (while being over-trained). I thought I'd get 3-4 at best, but this time the difference between training and the actual event worked out in my favor. Managed 14 reps I think, as well as falling on my ass. I should have bailed the attempt instead of trying to balance it out and finish the rep, but at the time all I could think was to not waste the effort.

**[Yoke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6aM9WbCTm8) - 500lb Yoke 50' down and 50' back (40')**  

Did more poorly than I'd hoped here. I was still gassed and nauseated from the deadlift. They were taking about 30 minutes between events, so that helped, but in the end I think I was just fried. I couldn't stay tight, lost balance a few times, and wasted a lot of effort each time I had to pick the yoke back up. Only made it about 40 feet total. Sad.  


**[Tire](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6w8-P_o5b3w) - 650lb Tire 5 flips down, 5 flips back (9 reps)**  

A very fun event. Originally the tire chosen was going to be 500lbs, but they decided that was too light for us and switched to a larger, 650lb tire. I liked that, because they were right. Ended up getting 9 flips in the time limit, so I didn't finish. The reason was more lack of conditioning than lack of strength. Lost speed, so I couldn't be explosive on the extension, leaving me wasting time trying to wedge myself under the thing to try and finish the last few reps.

  
**[Atlas Stone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjSbkFmLjUI) - 225lb Stone over a 50"" bar for reps (3 reps)**  

Honestly thought I might not finish a single rep. Before the event I warmed up with a few reps on the 180lb stone, and then gave the 225 a couple of failed tries. I was pretty nervous thinking of standing up there failing for 60 seconds, but once I got duck-taped up and tackied, this thing was much easier to pick up. You can see I didn't really have the technique down, but there was a moment where it clicked and I got a few up over the bar. This video is cut short too, I ended up getting 3 reps. I feel that the added heavy rowing was a huge contributor to my success here.

I was part of the second wave, weighed in at 12:30 PM and started lifting around 3 PM.

**TRAINING**

I've done many different routines over the years, including PHAT, Westside, and Sheiko (that was bloody murder, haha). For this contest prep I did 5 3 1. At the end of the deload week I picked one day to reset my maxes, then rinse and repeat. Nothing too complicated.

**DIETING: EAT EVERYTHING** (well almost)
I did a bodybuilding show in March, so I have been bulking ever since then. Always made sure to get 4000+ calories in every day, and by contest time I was a little lighter than I would have liked.

Squat:

~~413.4~~: Not happy. I can do this in my sleep, but for whatever reason I stumbled at the end of the lift and got red lights. I knew I had the lift so I continued on as if I had made it.

451: Felt good. All whites.

~~490.5~~: This was a state record attempt. I had done 495 in training before so I decided to go for it. I just didn't have it. I tweaked my back during this attempt as well. An official pulled me off to the side later on during the meet and said that I was actually squatting TOO LOW.

Bench:

(This is by far my weakest lift and something I need to work on. Unfortunately this was not filmed.)

231.5: 3 whites

251.5: 3 whites

275.6: An absolutely epic struggle. Felt to me like it took a whole minute to get the weight up. 3 whites in the end.

Deadlift:

496: 3 whites

556.7: 2 whites and a red, side judge didn't like my knee

State record is 600.8. I was thinking about it, but I had never been able to crack 600 in practice and the 556 lift felt tiring.

578.7: 3 whites and a scream :) This lift tied the junior state record.

**TAKEAWAY**

Overall a good meet. Took 1st place in 198 juniors, 2nd overall 198. I'm kinda disappointed in my squat, I thought I had more in me.

I'm currently resting my sore and tight back, and once I'm healed up I'll continue 5 3 1 until the next competition, which I haven't decided what to compete in yet. For all future competitions, I will cut. I need to get more mass everywhere because I kinda still look like a lanky goon. I'd like to stay at 198 for future competitions.

O, and those deadlift and squat records are mine next time.

This topic is to ask questions of experienced trainees.

So - I use a flat back for most of my sets, but anything up about 85% of my 1RM and above my back starts to round, especially in the upper back. I've never had any pain, problems or issues with this - but another gym random pointed it out to me again after a recent deadlifting session and it got me thinking. Those that typically advocate rigid form with straight back (like this guy) never seem to deadlift much. All the people I know (and all the strongman guys I train with) tend to lift with some bend in their spine and lift a shitload of weight.

My own form is similar to KK - very rounded upper back, with a straight low to mid back. I'm currently coming back from an injury (2 months off), so was only lifting about 190kg, previously I could go to 230+.

What are your experiences with this? Has anyone got horror stories to share about this sort of lifting? ",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_zsztu,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/zsztu/deadlifts_round_back_vs_straight_back_which_do/,

For those who don't like reading much, I won't keep you waiting.

~~[175kg \(385lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EEqx:1bAR)~~
~~[175kg \(385lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EEqx:1bAS)~~

I'm in a three way tie for first place.

**Deadlift**

265kg (584lbs)
[280kg \(617lbs](http://ustre.am/_1EFro:1bAL))
[292.5kg \(644lbs\)](http://ustre.am/_1EFro:1bAM)

Second place and a PR total of 700kg (1543lbs).

**Goals**

Going into this meet I didn’t quite know what to expect.  I dropped a weight class and the last raw meet I did at 181 was the inaugural raw nationals in 2008.  Comparing myself to what I did in the 198/205 class didn’t seem fair but neither did comparing myself to what I did four years ago.  Adding to the confusion, I decided to try a new peaking routine (5/3/1 for powerlifting).

Even without a good base for comparison, I had a prioritized list of goals.  First, get back to the Arnold Raw Challenge, this time in the 83kg class.  Second, set a PR total.  Third, set individual lift PRs.  Fourth, win and go for records.  I accomplished most of these goals.  I requalified for the Arnold, set PRs in the total and deadlift, and set a few national junior records.

**Making Weight**

I’ll try to be short.  I was close (within 1kg) 10 days out, then stupidly did a re-feed that put me 4.5kg over.  I ended up not eating or drinking anything for the last 36 hours and doing 30min of cardio in sweats 2 hours before the weigh in.

Did the cut effect my numbers?  Probably, but I have no idea how much.  However, I set a PR total so either the cut didn’t hurt me too much, or I would have set a huge PR.  For peace of mind I’ll go with the former.

**Squat**

It’s fairly normal for the squat to drop with bodyweight as it changes the biomechanics a little bit.  I did expect to have some drop off based on how my training went too so this wasn’t a shock.  
In retrospect, I should have only gone for 240kg for a third attempt.  I don’t know if I would have gotten it, but 237.5 was a struggle so it was stupid to go up any more than the minimum.

**Bench Press**

The bench press also typically drops with body weight but my training went great.   At the meet I thought that my opener felt easy, but the video shows otherwise.  
About those misses, at the meet I thought that I was just too loose on the 2nd attempt.   Because I thought I was too loose on the second attempt, I tried so hard to stay tight on the third that I pulled my legs too far back.  I couldn’t keep my left foot flat so I had to re-rack the bar twice.  Holding the weight for 45 seconds wore me out.

Now that I’m out of the meet and have a level head, I’ll admit that my strength  dropped some too.  Missing a weight that I’ve done for triples in training is more than just a technique issue.

**Deadlift**

Finally a good lift!  In training I had some struggles but solved all my problems the last week.  The problems arose from changing my technique.  The easy fix was going back to the form that led to my prior bests.  I really have to thank my training partner on the weight selection on the last one.  I was nervous about the jump but he told me that I had no reason not to go for it.  I had second place locked in so why not go for a PR total?  With that kind of logic, why only go for a PR and not first?  Going for first would have meant deadlifting more than the 83kg class deadlift world record holder (I weighed more than him).  Rather than try to do that, I “settled” for a PR.

**Thoughts**

Now I'll compare myself to last year's raw nationals.  I dropped a weight class, improved my total, and placed higher.  It's hard to do better than that so I'm very happy.

Looking forward, I'm going to make two changes: 1) No new peaking routines; 2) Diet before the meet prep, not during it.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1344262542.0,,,True,t3_xrkuh,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/xrkuh/meet_report_usapl_raw_nationals_killeen_tx/,

Traditionally, assistance work is recommended to be lower intensity, higher rep, but I'm interested in what would change if I did 3 sets of 225x5 on front after the back sets.


I'm familiar with the strength vs. hypertrophy rep:weight ratios, but I'm specifically asking about assistance work. Do the higher rep, lower intensity sets performed after high intensity work offer any advantages, strength-wise, over high intensity assistance work?

It doesn't go into any specific programs, but it does give a good overview of the current science.

[Zatsiorsky](http://www.hhdev.psu.edu/kines/faculty/profiles/zatsiorsky.html) is Russian and has a huge background in Eastern European strength training. Poliquin has [a bio of Zatsiorsky](http://www.charlespoliquin.com/Blog/tabid/130/EntryId/648/Five-Lessons-I-Learned-from-Vladimir-Zatsiorsky.aspx) if you want to read it. Kraemer at one point worked at the US Army's Research Institute of Environmental Medicine and has a [resume](http://www.education.uconn.edu/directory/details.cfm?id=44) longer than I'll ever have.

To give you an idea of how much research these two have done: A PubMed search for [""Zatsiorsky VM""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Zatsiorsky%20VM) turns up 147 results. [""Kraemer WJ""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=kraemer%20WJ) turns up 362 results. The Poliquin article says Zatsiorsky has 393 published papers, so I'm a guessing a lot of those are Russian and don't even come up on PubMed. This book is the concentrated knowledge of two entire lifetimes of research.

Okay, now that I've plugged the book so hard, I won't feel so bad for pirating a few pages of it.

* [Percent body weight supported by the hands during push-ups at various body postures](http://i.imgur.com/rMKky.png)

Push-ups on a flat surface are 60-70% of body weight. Push-ups with the feet inclined 122 cm (4 feet!) are 73-80% of body weight.

* [A couple pages on relative strength](http://i.imgur.com/BEF2S.png)

I am a nerd, so I was astounded that you could take a completely abstract model of the human body, do some math, and come within 4.5% of the measured values.

* [A couple pages on muscular endurance](http://i.imgur.com/K2x5o.png)

If I want to do a crazy number of body weight chin-ups, that excerpt says I better just keep on adding weight until my body weight is 75-80% of my 1RM, and then I can start adding in muscular endurance exercises. That graph in the lower right I also found very interesting.

In conclusion, this book is pretty bad ass. I've been pimping those scans in comments around here for a while and figured I should put them all up at once.

Below is a how-to on making and using sandbags. You can find it on bodybuilding.com, steroidology, a bunch of other lifting boards. I'm not sure where it comes from originally or where credit should go:
""Made new bags the other day. I didn?t see anything posted, so I thought I would explain what I did:

**Items needed:** 

1. 2mil or 3mil construction garbage bags (I used 3mil) = $7 for 50+
2. Duct Tape = $3
3. Sand = $3 - $4 per 50lb bag, from Lowes or Home Depot 
4. Army Duffle bag = $12 


**Steps:**

1. Pour desired amount of sand in 3mil bag. I did not pack it because I want the sand to move around a little in the bag. I made a 150lb bag, so I poured 3 bags of sand into the 3mil bag. I sealed the first bag with duct tape and then tripled the bag, sealing all three bags with duct tape before placing into the other. 
2. I then placed the sealed 3mil bags into the army duffle bag and closed all straps on the army duffle bag. 

And there you have it?..hehehe I made a 100lb, 150lb and 200lbs bag this week. For cardio I will take the 100lb abd 150lb bag to a track and walk around. 

I live in NY. I did this around my block, but was stopped by the police. I guess seeing a 250lbs sweaty guy carrying a big army duffle bag thru the streets of NY looked a little suspect?.LOLOL 

the 200lb bag is mostly for squatting. 

The sandbags will give you the most versatility, allowing you to do endless different exercises. Sleds or moderate-sized tires will offer great versatility as well, so they should also be a priority. I use sandbags for almost every exercise imaginable, including basic moves such as carries, rows, squats, rotations, lunges, and military presses.

We also do combos and complexes using other movements such as Turkish get-ups, shouldering into squatting, burpees into snatches, clean, squat and press, and thrusters. 

We also combine walking with movements. This way we work on conditioning, static strength, strength, and power, simultaneously. Try walking with a sandbag and every ten steps perform three to five reps of an exercise. Walk and squat, walk and bent-over row, walk and shouldering, walk and then clean and press. The possibilities are endless!

Two variations when using two sandbags at the same time.

Wanna work on power? You can throw your sandbag: squat and push throw, scoop toss, or rotational throw. You can throw the bag by starting from the ground to work on starting strength and power, or you can pre-swing the bag before throwing it to gain some momentum.

For the combat athletes I train, we often focus on time-under-tension and keep cranking out sandbag exercises for up to six minutes straight without putting it down. This trains the body and mind in a variety of ways and allows us to mimic much of what the body endures during an actual grappling or wrestling match. The carryover this has on the athletes' conditioning is phenomenal.""",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_kfrke,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/kfrke/methods_of_getting_big_and_strong_on_the_cheap/,

My training has always consisted of squats, rows, pulls and presses. Recently, within the last 2.5 months I have incorporated more olympic movements, power cleans &amp; power snatches, preempting my change of sport and shifting the focus on dynamic and explosive power (as well as other more specific ab work and related movements.). Due to the late decision the University have delayed the transition until next year, In this time I would like to increase my numbers before my fitness evaluation and a programme is given to me.

In that 2.5 months though I have noticed that these lifts haven't increased as any much as I have experienced previously with any other lift. Granted, I know how strength training works, and power cleans require explosive strength, and that requires time, but I would have expected to see a greater increase. 

**My question is** how does one go about periodising these lifts to see progression? Similarly what supplementary exercises will increase the explosive strength of my lower back. Currently on my olympic days, I will after my warm up sets, work at 3x3 70%, 4x2 at 80% and 3x1 at 90%. On alternate days I mix up the rep ranges, going 3x3 at 70, 3x3 75% and 3x3 at 80.
Currently i do supplementary exercises of 5x4 front squats,  4x3 snatch grip dead lift/snatch high pull.

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. I am aware there are probably some flaws in my programming.

If it helps, currently I am 6ft 4 110 kg (242 lbs)
Throw: 50 m (164ft, In training) 
Power Clean 110 kg
Power Snatch 90 kg (198 lbs)

Squat: 200 kg (440 lbs)
Bench: 130 kg (286 lbs)
OHP : 100 kg (220 lbs)
Dead Lift: 230 kg (507 lbs) [Just in case you were wondering]

Mens open raw division, aiming for the 83kg weight class but competed at 83.1kg (183lbs) in the 93kg group. 28 years old, 175cm (5’8”) . Totalled *edit* 465kg (165, 105, 195) going 8/9.**

Best gym lifts: 161kg squat,  111kg bench, 192kg deadlift for a 464kg total, but spread across different days. My last try at a 3-lift max out day was about 10kg below my individual maxes.

The meet was being held across town with a 2-hour weigh in, so I was up at 7:30 to double check my bag, throw together a one water bottle normal and one of pre-workout, and got there a few minutes before the 9:30 weigh-ins were to start. This was my first meet, and my first time competing at anything athletic since junior high, so minimizing the odds of feeling panicked was part of the plan.

The warmup room was small but we managed to get a good rotation going between the 6 or 7 guys in my flight, basically grouping off roughly by weight class (or height, for squats) and working up towards our openers. Deadlift warmups were a solid camaraderie moment, 2 bars set up as a ladder and all the guys helping the next one set up the weight they wanted and everyone switching back and forth without any ego between the 250-350kg guys and the ones working up to 200.

My openers were based on the simple “whatever you can triple on a good day or grind out on a crappy one” suggestion, just for the sake of building momentum and having an official total. I’m glad I didn’t see video of my opening squat (140kg) because what should have been just another warmup felt like when Bambi tries to walk; knees every-fucking-where. Dialed it in at 162.5 and then 165kg, both three whites and a conservative PR. Nerves had settled and I’d figured out the prep / lift / write next card / recover rhythm.

Bench is still my comparatively weak lift, so I wasn’t quite sure the next part would go. Wrote a silly low first lift, 95kg, and while it was sloppy (dropped too quickly and lost some tension right before the pause) it was light and just what I needed. Jumped 10kg and put that up as well, then tried for 115. Probably could have dug it out with a hip lift, but today it stalled halfway up. My gym-mate who was also doing the meet as a junior (21 year old tank) threw 140kg back up in the air like nothing, but got reds for moving to rack before the command; IIRC he added another 20 and crushed that too.

By the time deadlifts were starting I was already feeling pretty beat-down, but I just ran with the math I’d done ahead of time instead of picking numbers in the moment. Wanted to start a bit closer to my max than with the others, so went 175kg, just stood up and felt good. 185 (405lbs) is what I can comfortably single in the gym and that felt tough but I knew I was on track. Finished with a 195kg pull and managed a small smile at lockout which means I really should have just done 200+ instead :)

As for the meet itself, it’s under IPF so they’re pretty straight-laced. Suits, strict equipment rules (gym-mate couldn’t use his wrist wraps because they had non-sponsor logos visible), and no music, but you can tell they love the sport and want it to grow. There were no cockups and everything flowed quickly between lifters, flights, and events. The spotter available for bench handoffs was excellent, and the sides/back were in at perfect times for a few squats that needed a catch. It's hosted by the Air Force but oddly enough, nobody lifted in the Military classes and only one guy did Bench Only; everyone else was Junior or Open. A ton of my family and friends showed up which was really encouraging and gave me somewhere to reset between events. And most importantly for me, I now have an official total well clear of my original 1000lb goal.

Aaaaand now I'm hooked. There's already talks about a roadtrip to hit one of the USAPL meets in the northern states later this year.

[Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdFXrndTBDI&amp;feature=youtu.be)

I didn't see a guide for how to post this, so this is basically my thoughts on it.  To note at the beginning, yes I know I'm not strong enough nor do I have enough experience to be programming the way I do.  Due to the way my life is right now though I can't be consistent enough to stick to a program, even though I'd like to, so I'm going to give it a try.  If I can't make it work I'll have to rearrange my priorities and get onto an intermediate program and make that work.

**Results:** So this is the most interesting part to me when I read meet reports, and the results impact how I talk about anything else.  My squat and bench I wasn't too upset with.  I've done a 160KG squat in training and probably could have at the meet, but I decided to go for broke and missed it.  115KG is my PR on bench (my friend missed the video, but it was a pretty easy second lift), and 120KG is going to take more consistent form for one.  My deadlift was shit.  

I've pulled 190KG in training without too much difficulty, but haven't trained it on the same day as squats for a while, always make smaller jumps, and probably shouldn't have gone for 190 as my second attempt.  You may also notice in the second video my left foot slips.  I had baby powder applied to my legs and didn't clean my feet enough clearly.  That wasn't an issue on the third attempt, but I don't know if my mental state had anything to do with it or if I just didn't have the strength left in me.  Who knows.

My bench really needs some form work.  The 110KG lift was harder than it should have been because I let the bar come too low, and I did the same on the 120KG lift that I failed.

I did take the silver in the 93kg category, but there were only 3 competitors and the third guy missed all 3 bench attempts (I out squatted him, he out deadlifted me, and he tried 140kg on bench, no idea what he really could have done.)

**General Background:** I was a 250lb fatty with no real strength up until a year spent in China from mid 2010-2011.  Dropped down to 190lbs, and started lifting when I came home.  Started on Stronglifts on October 30th, 2011.  So this is about a year of progress.

At the end of July I tested my maxes in a gym in the US and hit 325lbs/235lbs/405lbs.  I then moved to Japan and getting consistent training, sleep, nutrition hasn't been the easiest while transitioning.  I started trying to work out based on the CnP template, and basically wasn't approaching it correctly.  The first 2 months I was here I wasn't paying enough attention to form and my squats sucked because I was loading the bar too high on my back.  High volume/intensity pressing was working, but lack of sleep was what fucked that from going further.  The deadlift I can't really evaluate fairly, but I am going to have to adjust how I train it so I can pick attempts better.

The lack of sleep was probably my biggest downfall.  Not only for not recovering, but for allowing it to affect my workout selection too much.  Recovery was big, as when I realized my sleep was fucking me up I went from not being able to do 130KG for 12 doubles with low rest one week to doing it easily the next.  I also have realized in retrospect I was allowing myself to do too many singles and not enough triples in that framework because I was often tired at the gym.

My schedule still sucks for being consistent (occasionally staying late at work, getting to a gym that I can actually lift at means waking up at 6:30 and not getting home until 9PM on lifting days, and my GF's work schedule is inconsistent so I can't go as often as I'd like), so I am going to give a little more time with the CnP framework, but I have to adjust it to my schedule.  I would go on something like the Texas method but it's just too likely that I'll either be under-rested or unable to go on a heavy day, which would fuck it up pretty bad.  With this at least I can have a week where I go MTR and not have everything fucked up completely.

**Cutting:** I know everyone says not to cut for your first meet, and I can definitely see why.  However, the classes here that were reasonable were 93KG and 105KG.  My weight 2 months out was 98KG (with carbs in the diet) and I was cutting anyway.  I got down to about 94KG (on no carbs) just from dieting and didn't really lose any strength.  The meet was a 2 hour weigh in so I didn't do anything crazy, basically just did water loading to drop the rest.

For my next meet I'll probably do about the same, but due to the competition level here (Best lifter was a guy at 66kg who I think did 165/125/200KG or approximately that) I'll try to be close to the 93KG class so I don't have to do much of a cut.  Dehydrating on the Saturday before the meet sucked hard, and now that I've seen how it works I can be less aggressive with it if I'm close.

**Goals now:** So I had a lot of fun and I learned quite a bit I think.  I'd like to be more competitive for best lifter at the next meet and hopefully win the 93KG class (Winner was 160/110/215KG).  I took an easy week after the meet, and some life/work stuff is going to interfere this week, but after that I'm going to go hard again.

My first goal is to get my squat up to using 180KG for a singles workout (as in 10-15 singles at that weight with low rest).  I know it will take a while, but I'm going to aim for that.  Despite the fact that I like the deadlift a lot more than the squat, I'm clearly more consistent at the squat.  

I'm going to try to be as consistent as I can squatting 3 times a week but mixing up the types of squat.  Ideally I'll do regular squats once a week, then mix up front squats, jump squats, and zerchers (primarily because my abs/low back feel like a weak point to me).  I've found in the past that I've made some pretty good gains by mixing up the type of squat.  When I tweaked my hip with low bar a few months ago I front squatted while I healed and my low bar squat was higher when I came back.  I'm also going to lean more heavily towards triples because I'm simply not strong enough to benefit from singles.  I'll keep them occasional for trying to feel out what numbers I should start with at a meet and on shitty days.

The bench is going to be pretty much all triples and all paused for the foreseeable future.  I need to get more consistent with form and I'm not going to do that without more volume.

In testing my deadlift previously I pulled 405 when I had never attempted more than 335 before, so I'm going to actually put that on the back burner for now.  When I get more consistent in life I'll get to go to the gym more and work it more, but I think mixing it in occasionally at the end of the workout to keep the form down is where it'll be for now.  It may fall to shit but a lot of people don't deadlift often and I'm going to see how that works for me.  If it's shit, then I'll fix my program.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_14526v,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/14526v/meet_report_445kg_total_at_912kg_body_weight_93kg/,

1344310335.0,35,self.weightroom,xsze3,Smolov Jr write up xpost from /r/fitness,MEatRHIT,45,10,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/xsze3/smolov_jr_write_up_xpost_from_rfitness/,"So here is my quick and dirty write up of my Smolov Jr Cycle:

**Beginning**: I started out with a 1RM [around 315lbs paused](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1487hYDtEzk), I initially started the cycle because ""snapped my shit up"" deadlifting and wanted to give it some rest while still bumping my powerlifting total up. 

**Program**: I ran [Smolov Jr](http://wkak.net/SmolovFAQ.htm) for the regular prescribed 3 weeks (+10lbs each week) and then another week at another 15lbs since I was having such an ""easy"" time in week 3. I have some of my videos of the work sets on my youtube page but was told I could no longer use my camera so I don't have any after week 1.

**End of Program**: I ended up my last 10x3 day (last Thursday I think) using 305lbs and it was insanely tough and probably shouldn't have done that day as my shoulder was perfectly fine up to that point but has been a bit sore since.

**New 1RM Video**: [Today I benched 350lbs for 1 with some left in the tank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu_LR60RSzg), I didn't pause because I *really* wanted to get 360 and didn't want to wear myself out too much. I then attempted 360 but my spotter grabbed the bar when he saw it move down a *bit*, in his defense I always tell him to take the bar when I say something or when the bar travels back down, which it did, but I may still have been able to lock it out.

**Shitty Excuses**: I had crap for sleep last night but that wasn't going to get better the rest of the week so fresh I could probably have gotten the 360. 350 was actually my end of the year goal so not bad for August.

**Training from here**: I'm going to taper the volume down rather than going straight back to 5/3/1 like I did last time I ran Smolov Jr. I peaked from 285-&gt;315 back in February-ish and it settled to ~300 a few weeks later, hopefully tapering down will alleviate the peak a bit. I would like to get a ""Masters"" total at my powerlifting meet in December at 198lbs (1375lb total). I'm still nursing my back, but squats seem to be fine so I'll be running a variation of 5/3/1 and squatting at least 2x a week and doing targeted assistance work for deadlifts (rows, good mornings, etc.).

**Other stuff**: 

**Supplements**: [D-AA](http://examine.com/supplements/D-Aspartic+Acid/), [Fenugreek](http://examine.com/supplements/Fenugreek/), [I3C](http://examine.com/supplements/Indole-3-Carbinol/), Creatine, Whey, DS Craze or C4 (pre workout)... I think that is about it.

**Bodyweight**: floating around 200-205 @ 5'11"" after starting creatine back up

**Training History**: 180lb Bench Bro with fuckarounditis up to 1.5 years ago, when I started squatting and deadlifting, switched to 5/3/1 shortly there after (somewhere around 300/250/400) separated my shoulder snowboarding February 2011 and had to take ~3 months off. In my first powerlifting meet in December my lifts were 365/275/500 if I remember correctly

**Other PRs**: Squat:435x1 Deadlift:525x1

The main focus of Training Tuesdays will be programming and templates, but once in a while we'll stray from that for other concepts.

Last week we talked about  [20 Rep Squats,](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/qug52/training_tuesdays/) and a list of previous Training Tuesdays topics can be found in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/weightroom#TrainingTuesdaysDiscussions)

This week's topic is:

&gt;  Strength training for non strength-focused activities. What are you doing to train for activities like jiu-jitsu, wrestling, baseball, running, etc.?

* What sports or other disciplines do you participate in that require strength or physical fitness?
* How do you balance your sports and your training, and how do you fit them around each other?
* Do you have any good articles or resources regarding training for either your sport or other activities in general?
* How has strength training positively or negatively affected your other disciplines?


Feel free to ask other training and programming related questions as well, as the topic is just a guide.

* 5'10"", 83.8 kg, 25 years old

**Meet**

220 @ 85 was good for third in the men's 85 open division. (Out of three, haha.) 220 is actually a PR total for me in a meet though, with my previous best being 218 weighing roughly 94kg.

My coach was mostly running the meet, so this was my first time calling all the shots myself. I'm not exactly sure how powerlifting works, but in weightlifting the bar only increases in weight, so picking your attempts actually requires you know how the meets works and what everyone else is taking. (Or more importantly what you think they'll take, since they can always change what's on the card.) Snatch went fine since a lot of people were taking similar attempts. I would have liked to open higher in the clean and jerk but I kind of mistimed my warmups. It probably worked out better that I didn't push it too hard though, since I ended up having to follow myself after each attempt. (Two minute clock instead of one.)

The 220 total easily qualifies me for the 2012 National University Championships, but I don't think I'll be able to miss school/work to travel.

**Meet Prep**

Since this was just a local meet, I didn't really alter my training very much in preparation. I was lifting basically 3-4 days a week, each day starting with an olympic lift to near max, then just doing some combination of bs/fs/dl/p/pp afterwards.

The week of the meet I cut the strength work and did both oly lifts on Monday and Wednesday, still to near max.

**Notes**

* I don't think you can see it in the video, but the meet was actually run on two platforms simultaneously. This was actually really great since it allowed the meet to run on time for once. And the announcer was great, and helped move the meet along quickly.
* The Mattoon Wendy's does not have $1 Junior Bacon Cheeseburgers. This ruined my traditional post-meet meal. They also lack $1 Double Stacks.
* Moving horse stall mats is deceptively hard. They're pretty heavy, but also impossible to grip.
* Did some loading and judging for some of the other sessions.
* Next meet will probably be the 2012 Illinois State Weightlifting Championships in late April in Chicago.
* I probably left out some stuff.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_r3nvi,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/r3nvi/meet_report_2012_mattoon_il_open_weightlifting/,

**Training Background**

I started 3 years ago with StrongLifts, moved on to Starting Strength when the workouts got too long, then switched to 5/3/1 BBB last fall when I'd plateaued on everything for months.

**Day of the Meet**

I realized that my cut was not going to get me where I needed to be about a week out, so I stopped cutting and started eating maintenance.  I didn't eat before weigh in, then had a protein shake and some oatz with fruit and sugar.  I think this ended up being perfect, my nausea eventually abated and I was just left with nervousness.

I had fruit and trail mix between sessions, and drank Mt Dew (I hate coffee).

**Lifts**

I competed raw in the 90kg (198.42lbs) class.  I think I weighed in at 87kg (191.8lbs), but can't remember for sure.

* Squat: 57.5kg (126.8lbs), 65kg (143.3lbs), 72.5kg (159.8lbs)
* Bench: 40kg (88.2lbs), 45kg (99.2lbs), missed 50kg (110.2lbs)
* Deadlift: 100kg (220.5lbs), 110kg (242.5lbs), 117.5kg (259lbs)

**Lessons Learned**

* I need to eat more.  It's clear to me that I did as well as I did because I took away any eating restrictions on this day.  I could have deadlifted another 20lbs, and squatted at least another 10.  I think my eating habits have been holding me back.
* I need a belt of my own.
* My coach is awesome.

**Future Plans**

* Figure out some kind of sane eating plan that won't make me fat but will let me gain maximum strength.  I *was* stronger than the 8 year old in all my lifts, that helps a little.
* My trainer has been invaluable.  He got my lifts up, put me in a belt, adjusted my form, got me the space and time to warm up, and helped me determine what my attempts should be.  I'm going to keep going back for more :)",,False,,t5_2ssmu,True,,,True,t3_q7t19,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/q7t19/meet_report_20120226_usapl_wa_state/,

**Overhead Press** — same as bench press, plus low back/abs.







**Assistance work for those muscles:**


**Abs** — sit ups, ab wheel roll-outs, hanging leg raises.

The prep for this meet was bit haphazard.  I got the flu about 5 weeks out from the meet and missed about 6 or 7 workouts and I went on spring break about 3 weeks out from the meet and missed 3 workouts.  
I don’t follow any named program that I know of, I run a three day split of legs, chest &amp; tri’s, and back &amp; shoulders.  With this I lift 6 days a week, 3 of which are heavy days.  My rep ranges for main lifts didn’t exceed 6 since I started training for this meet in January.  My accessory rep ranges were higher, generally in the 7-12 range. 


My diet was pretty loose until about three weeks out.  While I was training, I was floating around 154 in the mornings.  I started dieting about three weeks out from the meet, as soon as I got back from spring break. I live in a college dormitory so most of my options aren’t the best but with a little planning it wasn’t too hard to cut weight.  My pre-meet diet was essentially keto, I aimed to eat as little carbs as possible.  I accomplished this by eating omelets for breakfast on the days I ate breakfast, about 6 or 7 grilled chicken breasts for lunch with spinach, and whatever lean meat they were serving and more spinach for dinner.  Whenever the dining halls weren’t offering anything healthy, I would have a protein shake or microwave some turkey burger patties that I made and froze and home and brought back to school.  The week before the meet I ate almost zero carbs and tried to drink between double and triple the amount of water that I normally would.  I ended up weighing in at 146.2 without having to any kind of hard water cut in the morning which means I can stay in 148’s for a while.


I totaled 1122, good for a national USAPL record. My squat and bench also set national USAPL records and my Wilks was 398 before age was factored in. I missed best teen lifter by about 10 age-wilks points to a monstrous 181 lb. 16 year old.  Missing the start command on bench was totally unacceptable given that this was my fourth or fifth meet, but other than that I’m satisfied with this meet given the amount and quality of meet prep.


As for future plans, I don’t know when I’ll compete next.  In the meantime I may jump back to a 4 day, no rest day split for a little while to mix things up but I’m not certain yet.  I intend to stay in 148’s for at least another year and really think I could put up some really good numbers if everything comes together for a meet.  


Right now my biggest priority is getting my deadlift up, which I plan on doing by actually deadlifting.  I only pulled off the floor maybe 3 times between January and the meet, my school gym has hex plates so I don’t like deadlifting there but I’m going to try to go to another gym off campus more often where I can pull heavy off the floor.  Viewing myself lift, I also noticed a couple form issues I need to fix. I had no idea my knees caved that bad when I squatted heavy or that my I lifted off the bench on my third attempt.


My main goal for this meet was to put up a decent total in 18-19 148’s and my mindset was just to get some numbers down because I intend to surpass them later on anyway, so going 7/9 and breaking 3 national USAPL records was enough to satisfy me for this meet.

Foam roll legs, back, tennis ball arms, chest, the whole gamut.

Deadlift, going up to 5RM (375 today). Then 1RM. Descend plate by plate for 5 reps each. I use chalk always and mixed grip on the top 3 sets.

Assists - Platform D/L, Weighted Back extensions, pause squats, all 3x5. Go home and foam roll while cooking.

I feel it's an ambitious goal, but screw it - that's what the iron is all about. I would appreciate your input about my program and what you would do with this goal. Thanks!

Edit: I've also recently started squatting facing out of the power rack, i.e. not at a mirror. Gon' keep doing that for SURE.

How to actually go about hitting on a woman while she's lifting is a whole 'nother topic I suppose, but the consensus seems to be, ""nuh-uh. don't do it if you're not getting VERY CLEAR signals this is welcome."" So let's talk about delivering plain ol' heartfelt compliments.

I'm sure there's plenty of men in here that don't need this kind of help, but there's definitely enough that seem to want to know the right way to go about this, but just don't know how, exactly.

So ladies, share your stories about the compliments that made you feel like wonder woman, and any that made you want to blow the rape whistle you keep tucked in your deadlifting socks. Perhaps some of the SAPs reading this will avoid some black eyes. :P

I began with linear progression on SS, then moved on to Texas Method for a bit. Then, I stupidly decided I needed to cut weight and did 5/3/1 for 3 cycles and ended up losing a good deal of strength. 

I'm now getting back to about where I was (5RM-sq: 335, bench: 235, ohp: 155, dl: 385) before cutting about 25 lbs. currently-sq: 315, bench: 205, dead: 355, ohp: 135. at ~190lb BW.

I've been progressing again using Texas Method because it worked before and is again, but I feel I could keep trying linear gains. My diet is MUCH better than it was last time I was on SS and I've since done lots of volume and vastly improved form. I'm considering moving back to SS next week to try it out or perhaps modifying it with lighter weights on Wednesdays to recover.

On a similar note, my roommate, who has been lifting a lot longer than me, just moved back to SS linear gains after doing other programs. He is lifting about 100lb more than myself on each lift and he is still making gains on it. I understand it could be genetics, sleep behavior, and eating that help him too. 

I typically hear people moving away from SS around a 300 squat, but some of the members on 70sbig.com have been doing SS with lots of resetting weights and still make gains at much higher weights. 

So, my question is, has anyone heard of something similar to returning to Linear Progression after using other programs, and still making progress? Thanks in advance",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_uy38k,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/uy38k/returning_to_linear_progression/,

Had lost a ton of weight and gained a decent amount of strength doing Kettlebells for about a year, and I've switched over to SS and have had some great gains there.  My nutrition for increasing gains without gaining too much weight seems to be decent (not perfect...I still eat too much sweet things...lol) as I have still had tons of gains while not gaining more than about 5-7lbs since I started SS nearly 4 months ago.

Now I want to lean out pretty significantly.  I know I can do it, I've already lost a significant amount of weight (over 100lbs) in the past year or so, so I'm not concerned with actually doing it.  I more concerned about undoing my SS gains while on a cut.

I would like to lose another 30lbs or so.  I hover around 220 @ 5' 11"", and I think I would be (mostly) happy at 190.

What would you recommend for nutrition to maintain strength while cutting fat?  Any and all suggestions accepted.  Thanks /r/weightroom :D

If you are not interested in weightlifting technique, or the movements I still believe this is a highly informative and interesting lecture about the body and it's bio-mechanics in general but it's a long series and takes a while to warm up.

Some of you may be familiar with Tommy Kono in the context of [bodybuilding](http://i.imgur.com/SRNR1.jpg), considering he won the Mr. Universe twice but I think he's better known for the two gold medals that he earned in weightlifting, his twenty-one world records set in [weightlifting](http://i.imgur.com/khYXy.jpg) and his six year span as world champion. He later became a well renown coach, including coaching the USA olympic team. 

This is the the [first ten minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNy0Odapgds), skip to [7:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNy0Odapgds&amp;t=7m4s) if you don't want to hear his introduction. He covers the importance of the hips in the ability of the body to transfer power.

This is the [second ten minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60vffX5bX_Y&amp;feature=related), mainly about acceleration of the bar, simple physics, and position of the spine.

[Third ten minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhxqEmLYuCA&amp;feature=related) discussing the position of the shoulders, strong back, start position, and begins to talk about bar path.

[Fourth ten minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k27zIdL5SkI&amp;feature=related) talking about moving out of the starting position (the initial pull), and extension.

[Fifth ten minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9rI00e7BzE&amp;feature=related) continuing extension, position of the wrists, swinging of the bar vs a pull and beginning talking about the jerk.

[Sixth and final four minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezMNoHUXbb8&amp;feature=related) talking about the jerk, bouncing out of the bottom of the catch, and some finishing remarks.

I really think that weightlifting is beautiful, there are hundreds of awesome videos over at /r/weightlifting but [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFyv2kkQFV0) is one that I always find really neat.

If anyone has questions or comments on the video, post them here! I'll try to answer whatever I can, and people smarter then myself will answer the rest.

Because I lack a neck harness I just do plate neck ""crunches"" to the front and back for high reps a few times a week. I'll get back to you on that in a few months if it's actually working.

Oh yeah, first time you do neck work your neck will be sore as fucking shit and you might end up near-crashing your car because turning your head is like a trial of the Gods (alright, alright, it's not that bad but trust me).",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_19h66l,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/19h66l/lets_talk_about_neck_baby/,

I had symptoms of both lateral and medial epicondylitis as well as cubital tunnel syndrome. My left arm was losing strength due to the nerve impingement. The pain and symptoms were most noticeable when I bench pressed. I tried a regiment of NSAID's (500mg Naproxen Sodium 2x day). I tried oral prednisone. I had a cortisone injection. Nothing worked. The pain came back. I cut the pressing movements to 65% to give myself some active recovery time. I eliminated a lot of exercises from my routine that caused elbow pain. The thing I wouldn't do was stop lifting completely. I wasn't willing to take time off. I worked hard for those gains and didn't want to lose muscle. Instead, I just lived with the pain, continued to lift and the plateaued for 6 months.

Something else (unrelated) forced me to take 6 weeks off lifting. I couldn't go to the gym at all. The elbow pain went away. I lost a lot of strength but I worked back up very close to my previous numbers and the gains have been pretty linear on my way back up. 

This time around I am going to pay carful attention to pain and take a week off when I think I need it. I will no longer push through that kind of pain.

tldr; Tendonitis will eventually stop your progress. Don't be afraid to take extended time off to heal so you can continue to make progress.  also, the sky is blue and water is wet.

Checking in at 6'2, I'm taller than some, and have been lifting for just short of a year. I also go to two gyms with different equipment. One has a non-adjustable squat rack where the safety's are about 5 inches too low to catch the barbell on a squat if I fail. The other has an adjustable one that I can put about 1 inch under my ass to grass squat. 

When I squat in the non-adjustable rack I am weaker. I question every squat, I wonder, ""If I fail, how am I going to get out of this?"" I have dumped a barbell before and it was not terribly pleasant. As a result I hold back a little in the tank on every movement; therefore, I'm not getting a full work out. I can't lift as heavy, and I take a lot longer to recover because I want to have all my energy. 

In the adjustable squat rack I know I can fail on any exercise and safely escape. I just drop it down an inch and it is safely on the rack. I give 100% on every movement, and I don't worry about failure. As a result I push myself harder and further than I think I am capable of working and almost always succeed. 

The same thing happens when I bench press without safety's or a spotter. I hold back and limit myself without the confidence to fail. Weights that I feel I struggle with with no spotter I can struggle through and not worry about with a spotter. I have done the roll of shame before, but when you are pressing heavy (around 200lb) it is quite uncomfortable, and I already have swollen sternum cartilage from something else. 

It isn't that big a deal when I am doing a heavy single, I have a pretty solid idea on how much I can move once, and I don't have to worry about going all out, racking the weight, and dying. But when I am doing rep work I like to have that confidence of safety. Knowing I can safely fail makes me stronger.

**The Meet**

I cut from 212 to 198lbs in 1 week for this meet.  I got pretty close to my best performance except on the squat because I had some squat singles misses in training and it made me a little too cautious.  The bench commands and the fact that it was paused really threw me off and I wasn’t able to hit my gym PR of 285.  

The squat was a 20lb PR and the deadlift was a 25lb PR over what I’ve done in the gym.  Based on projected 1RMs from my workouts, the deadlift was 5lbs under and the squat and bench were 40lbs under.


The highlight of the meet was the $1 deep tissue massage I got back stage on my knotted left rhomboid before deadlifts.  The worst part of the meet was the fact that they combined the morning and afternoon sessions into a +8 hour long 7am session and I didn’t bring nearly enough things to eat.  A few guys liked my Inzer lever belt and I let them use it for their attempts.  

I ended up placing second from last in the raw open division.

**History**

~1 year of training – 3 months of SL5x5 and then 10 cycles of 531.


I made the mistake of switching to 531 too early in my training when I could have milked gains out of Madcow or the Texas Method.  I did a Smolov base for squats and a Smolov Jr for bench after my 4th cycle and then went back for my 5th cycle immediately after that.  After 3 cycles my squat and bench strength dropped off again and I’ve been struggling to get it back.  /u/nomediocrity has a pretty good [write-up](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/13th1y/choosingtweaking_the_right_lifting_program/) on exactly why you should not do what I did.  


**Future Prospects**

After my 10th cycle of 531 I switched to the Texas Method (starting my 3rd week on Wednesday).  I plan to do that for 12 weeks and see what kind of volume I can handle.  My long-term goals are to total 1300 (300/450/550) and get swole.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_146d1f,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/146d1f/meet_report_usapl_2012_american_open_policefire/,

First, just get a total. I'd need one to lift in IPL Worlds in November. Second, go in and come out of the meet with no pain. I accomplished both of these, and despite an otherwise mediocre performance, I'm satisfied. I have a lot of room to improve before November and a solid plan on how to do it.

I weighed in at 117.5kg/259lbswent 5/9 and totaled 625kg/1377lbs with the following attempts:

Squat: [200kg/441lbs](http://youtu.be/wvH_L097XLs), [230kg/507lbs](http://youtu.be/gj1iz887Z1Y), [~~240kg/529lbs~~](http://youtu.be/o6_fX6nndgU)

Bench: [120kg/265lbs](http://youtu.be/Twun6nHODG8), [~~137.5kg/303lbs~~](http://youtu.be/mOjb_MnQpp0), [~~137.5kg/303lbs~~](http://youtu.be/ibCQXIgHh3Y)

**Preparation**

Preparation for this meet began in earnest 16 weeks out. Almost immediately my mild, intermittent case of bicipital tendinitis became rather severe and my priorities shifted to rehab and getting myself healthy. As a result, I didn't attempt any manipulation of body weight/composition and dialed back my training in all of my lifts for a time (as the tendinitis was screwing with every lift in some way). Through physical therapy, bodywork, and technique modifications, I eventually got to the point that I wasn't in pain when lifting or working about 5 weeks out. I did lose strength and weight during this time, running a low-intensity 5/3/1 for the big 3 until I was feeling enough to do a brief period of high intensity, low volume work to ramp up for the meet.

The night before the meet I did do my characteristic 30-40g creatine bloat and reinforced my previous experience that this produces constipation and does a good job of keeping me from crapping my pants on the squat. Good thing too, as the restrooms were far away and the meet was moving fast.

**Squat**

Warmups were short and sweet, working up to 405 for a single before hitting 441 and 507 on my first and second attempts. I was experimenting with a new bar position and hand placement and didn't have nearly enough experience with it, so I was shaky as hell at the top. After my second attempt, one of the judges pulled me aside and warned me to clearly have my knees locked before starting the squat. For my third attempt, I was again all sorts of shaky, briefly locked my knees (so I thought) and got the squat command from the head judge. 529 felt light in the hole and the judges said depth was good, but the side judges red lighted me for not having my knees locked out, despite having received the command to squat. But the weight came up and felt strong, so I'm chalking it up. The 507 was a meet PR over my previous best of 475.

**Bench**

Bench was about par for the course. Warmed up to 245 before opening with 264.5, which I hit without a problem. For some reason that I still can't fathom, I called for 303 on my second attempt. That's nearly a 40 pound jump. (What the hell, brain?) I missed it in my typical fashion, left shoulder shutting everything down once it hit a sticking point. Missed it again on the third attempt, almost exactly the same.

**Deadlift**

Deadlift is where I am strongest, and having pulled 620 in the gym recently, I was feeling pretty good about my chances of getting up around 630. Warmed up to 495 before taking 540 for an easy first attempt. Second attempt at 606 came off the floor fast, but my foot wobbled in my shoe and I lost all stability and missed the pull at my knees. Third attempt at the same weight I tightened my shoes, rallied myself and pulled the weight for a 5 pound meet PR. Not what I wanted, but I broke 600 again, so I'm happy.

For the curious, I wear orthotics in my shoes all the time, including when I lift. This is done to prevent pain in my lateral shin that wasn't going away with therapy or form correction and was exacerbated by squatting/leg pressing. With the orthotics I'm pain free. Deadlifting didn't really cause problems at the time, but because I had been wearing the orthotics for so long and training heavy loads with them, I found recently that removing them was detrimental to my leg drive. Something about afferent input from the bottom of the foot affecting neural drive to the rest of the leg. So I pull with the orthotics despite the extra height and instability. For this coming training cycle, I'm going to invest in some wrestling shoes that fit my inserts so I can at least be more stable with the orthotics.

**Summary**

It was a really small, fast meet with only 16 full power lifters, a few of which were single ply. As a result I was the only competitor in the 275 lbs men's open raw division and took first place by default in both full power and deadlift only. I would have liked more competition, but that's why I'm going to IPL Worlds in November.

I met some great dudes, met my goals, and I know what I need to work on. I'm satisfied with that.

Now to gain 15 lbs in 12 weeks...

1339328637.0,32,self.weightroom,uuhif,[Meet Report] Battle of the Gyms 2012 25/M/79.4kg/430kg total,jklong,38,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/uuhif/meet_report_battle_of_the_gyms_2012_25m794kg430kg/,"This weekend I competed in my first powerlifting meet, the 2012 Battle of the Gyms in Canberra hosted by my gym Elite Physique. On the day I went 7 for 9 and matched my training total, which I’m mostly happy with considering I’ve been trying to work around a minor lower back and glute injury.

Unfortunately there is an absence of video due to someone forgetting to charge a video camera battery. A few photos have come out of it, but none really worth posting.

**Training and Preparation**

I messed up my back about 6 weeks out while getting out of bed. About this time I decided to deload on squat and deadlift and focus on bench via Smolov Jr (run over 5 weeks). It worked; my back is fine, my glute is mostly healed and I hit a massive PR on bench. I did light squat and deadlift work just to keep the movement grooved.

I didn’t bother with cutting any weight as there were only 2 weight classes (over and under 100kg) and I was well and truly in the lightweight class.

**The Lifts**

**Squat**

* 130kg - Red/Red/Red. This was an easy lift, however I got done for jumping the rack command because my feet moved at lockout.
* 130kg - White/White/White. One of the spotters was coaching me through the whole thing and recommended taking this again to work out the nerves. Went up easy.
* 140kg - White/White/White.

I’m a little disappointed in this. I feel like I left maybe 10-15kg on the platform, spectators said it looked like a warmup.

**Bench Press**

* 95kg - White/White/White.
* 100kg - White/White/White. Previous touch and go PR. Felt so light I nearly threw it through the ceiling.
* 110kg - White/White/White. +15kg from my pre-Smolov Jr paused PR. Felt incredibly easy too.
* 120kg - Red/Red/Red. Drove it off my chest just fine, but run out of steam for lockout.

Totally pleased with this, it improved out of sight since the last time I tested it. I failed the 4th attempt, but I think if I were fresh I’d have that in the bag.

**Deadlift**

* 165kg - White/White/White.
* 180kg - White/White/White. Previous training PR.
* 195kg - Red/Red/Red. This was all sorts of messed up. Glute freaked out on me while trying to break the ground, then my knees caved and it was all over.

Mixed feelings about this. 180 felt easier than the last time I pulled it and I definitely have more than that in me. Disappointed that 195 wouldn't even break the ground, but I know that's my weak point and some trainers there on the day gave me some tips on my form.

**Total: 430kg (946lb) @ 79.4kg (174lb) bw**

Edit: Results have been released. I got 11th out of 15 men overall with a 284.32 weighted total. Compared to the first place winner who went 270/185/275 for a 434.5 weighted total.

**Lessons Learned**

* Warmups. For squat and deadlift, I really had to rush the warmup due to time being short. I only finished a few minutes before my lift was called. Next time around I really need to give myself more time. Got carried away watching the heavyweights move some big numbers.
* Push yourself. This is a big one. I think it was a combination of nerves and babying my injury a bit, but I'm disappointed I didn't open the squat at least 135.
* You’re going to hurt. I haven’t felt DOMS like this in a while. Felt ok last night, but this morning I’m just in a world of hurt.
* Nutrition. I did a lot of research over how to approach this. I settled on some stimulants in the form of caffeine and DMAA at the start of the day, ready-to-drink protein cartons with roughly 30g PRO/CHO each and a couple of snickers bars. This went ok, probably wouldn't change it. 
* Conditioning. The bench and deadlift moved much quicker than I anticipated. Especially that 4th attempt. I think that contributed a bit to form breakdown in the deadlift. Time for me to hit the prowler...

**Closing Thoughts**

10/10, will be doing again. I had a great time, learned a lot and met some fantastic and really strong people. Saw a guy at 82.5 successfully pull an unofficial national record of about 275 (I think).

If you’re even mildly interested in competing, I recommend doing it.

* back to 70%- try to get 10 but if you do 8 or more you go up 10 lbs next week ( I usually waited until after the 2nd week before going up. You'll see why)


week 2

* warm up
* 4x4 at 70%
* 2 reps at 80%
* 2 reps at 90%
* 8+ reps at 70%

If you get all the reps then go up 10 lbs. If you don't then repeat.

Now the thread above touched on the Klokov (or snatch grip BTN) press and its technique. A bunch of people in there said how they had done the Klokov but really didn't get much merit from it, echoing my own experience with the lift. I enjoy doing it (even the grinding singles), but after doing them as my main overhead movement for about 6 weeks, my press from the front went *down*. Shoulder-wise I saw no changes either (whether size or density wise), so if you're in the game for hypertrophy, just do regular BTNs. I know Jamie has a huge hardon for them, but I honestly don't see why at all. 

I rarely do regular BTN presses (the seated type where you go down to about ear level), but I did standing BTNs the other day with a pretty regular grip (bit wider than shoulder width, what you'd use for regular BTNs) and sort of touch n go'd the upper part of my traps and they felt really nice. I think that's what old school Oly guys used to do as well, but I'm going by descriptions from articles that were written when Barry White was topping the charts so it's hard to say, and they must've only done them if they had any sort of carryover to the press.

1. Total 1000 lbs. I set this goal back in January when I originally signed up for the meet.

2. Hit PRs on each of my second attempts. This would give me a chance to harness ""meet magic"" for my third attempts across the board.

3. Have fun and learn what it's like to lift in front of a large group of amazing athletes.

I'm going to break this post into a few parts. First, I'll give the down and dirty about the meet and my attempts/results. I'll then go into meet prep and training. Finally, I'm going to go on a tangent and talk share my feelings about training and, to some extent, life.

All videos are forthcoming. They're on my friends phone so he needs to email them to me (since they are larger than his allowed message size).


**The down and dirty**

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWaJpwgEOtE

**Squat** - I went raw modern. Sleeves, no wraps, oly shoes and a belt.


-300 lbs (3 greens) - conservative opener. I rode a linear progression train into 295x3x5 (which I hit last Weds.) so it's been forever since I squatted with fresh legs. I hit 315 last Friday, but wanted a nice safe opener.

-325 (3 greens) - 10 lb PR at the time. Lost my chest a little bit but the bar flew out of the bottom.

-350 (3 greens) - 35 lb PR prior to the meet, and 25 lb PR over my previous lift. This was a grinder, but form was good. A few people came up to me throughout the day and said this lift pumped them up since it was such a solid fight. Huge PR for me, and a great goal achieved.


**Bench** - wrist wraps and belt.


-215 (3 greens) - another conservative opener. Easy hit.

-235 (3 greens) - 5 lb PR, not as fast as I had hoped, but I only recently started pause benching. I was torn between 240 and 245 for my third and ended up going with. . . 

-245 (3 red) - I lost my tightness at the bottom as the bar hit slightly higher than I wanted. I think I could have easily hit 240 but, oh well. It was a fun attempt.


**Deadlift** - no shoes, belt, chalk and ammonia.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xn80hxhDLNQ

-415 (3 greens) - This weight FLEW off the platform. My buddies came up to me and said I looked shocked at the top due to how light it was. This was another conservative opener.

-460 (3 greens) - 5 lb PR, and this also FLEW off of the platform. It felt like 315. I'm going to guess that having a week and a half of rest after riding a 10 lb/session linear DL progression for 2 months will put your back in a good place. I looked at one of my handlers (an amazing lifter) and gestured ""5 - 0 - 0 ?"", and he gave me the . . .

-500 (3 greens) - 45 lb PR and 40 lb PR for the day. What a fucking rush. I put myself in a dark place (parents divorce), ripped a massive amount of nose tork, gripped the bar and yanked that mother f'r off of the ground. What a RUSH!


**Meet Prep**


I weighed myself last night and was at 199-200, so I was just a little bit worried about making weight. I skipped breakfast (I'm on IF, so I never eat breakfast anyway) and weighed in at either 194 or 195. Went to a diner after and had a whole wheat calzone and sweet potato fries. Washed that down with a diet coke and I was good to go. Other than that the past week has been active recovery and very light reps of the lifts just to grease the groove. I stayed on IF, but made sure to eat fairly carb heavy the two days leading up to the meet.


**Recent Training**


Back in January I deloaded my squat to 185x3x5 and rode a 5lb/session linear progression through until last Wednesday when I hit 295x3x5. I ran 10lb/session 1x5 DL linear progression and texas method press concurrently. I eat IF with carb cycling and bike approximately 20-40 miles a week commuting. I get adequate sleep and eat clean. I work out with a bunch of competitive lifters at Cambridge Strength and Conditioning so we always lift in an electric atmosphere.


**Post-meet Thoughts**


I need to focus on squat and bench form. I need to keep a prouder chest on squats and start pause benching more. I'm going to add a ""light"" squat day on Weds. but continue to ride linear progression as long as possible.

For those of you thinking about competing, GO FOR IT. The atmosphere is amazing. Everyone is all amped up and cheering you on; it really is amazing. Meet magic is a very real thing. Two weeks ago I fought 455 off the floor. Today, 460 flew off of the ground like it was a warmup.


**My Recommendations for Prospective Competitors**


-Don't change ANYTHING. If you train in sleeves, lift in sleeves. If you don't eat breakfast, DON'T eat breakfast. 

-Have a handler (preferably who lifts). It's always nice to have someone to give you a second opinion on your next lift, to hold the nose tork for you, to slap the shit out of your trap, and to hold your ipod when you take it off.

-Bring food and water. My snack of choice was beef jerky and shortbread cookies. Meets are long, and your adrenaline will be FLOWING most of the day. Stay hydrated and stay eating.

-Be conservative with your openers. You are going to be so juiced up. The last thing you want is to adrenaline dump and bomb out on squat.

-LISTEN to the commands. I saw countless lifters (good lifters at that) miss lifts because they didn't follow commands. My opinion: focus on the commands, not the weight. You won't even realize how heavy it is.


**My General Musings**


For those of you who think you don't have the time, or the genetics, or the ability to get strong, I think you're a fucking liar. I went from a 185 lb squat to 350 in 2 months with nothing but hard work, clean diet and adequate sleep. Too busy to do that? Bullshit. I work 30-40 hours a week in my lab, teach, take 8 credits of class at night, volunteer on mondays and have to go into my lab on weekends. I also bike commute and am studying for the MCATs. If I can find time to do this, ANYBODY can. There is not secret formula. Oh, you have the time but you're not genetically gifted? I weighed 250 lbs in high school and was a fat tub of shit. I totaled 800 when playing football. 800! That was in my anabolic prime. Every time you step into the gym challenge yourself. Clear your mind. Forget about your stresses and problems in life. Turn the music up, get a few slaps on the back and slam some fucking bars. You can achieve anything you put your heart and soul into. Be fucking epic.

What is the best way to go about this?,zublits,44,11,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/12kozu/combining_lowrep_heavy_lifting_with_highrep/,"I'm currently in the process of revising my training regimen, and I need some help with it. My goals are to be strong and to build visible mass. I've been doing Strong Lifts for 4 or 5 months now, and lately I've been experimenting with adding some higher-rep (5x10) work at the ends of my 3x5 lifts to promote hypertrophy. So far, this has been working out well. It's too early to tell, but I feel as though my size gains are skyrocketing with the added hypertrophy work.

My 1RMs are as follows: Squat: 250 (still struggle with flexibility issues), Bench 200, Pendlay Row 190, Press 125, Deadlift 310 (could be higher, but haven't tested).

I'm still progressing, so I'm not planning to stop the linear loading on these lifts. 

My question is what is the most efficient way to add hypertrophy training to what I'm already doing? Currently I just add 5 sets of 10 for each muscle group after I've done the main lifts. For example on bench/row day I'll add 5x10 cable crossovers and 5x10 chinups; or 5x10 incline bech and 5x10 seated cable row. You get the idea.

Is this a decent way to go about it, or should I be changing to something like PHAT with 2 power days and 2 hypertrophy days? Any other thoughts?",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_12kozu,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/12kozu/combining_lowrep_heavy_lifting_with_highrep/,

I have been trying to correct it but I just don't manage to tighten my abs up well enough and my back bends inwards at the bottom. This also occurred before the layoff but it was not this bad, probably due to less weight than now.

Anyway, I've tried lowering the weight obviously and putting more time in to sitting dumbbell presses until can strengthen up my abs/core more.

This is however where I'm somewhat confused. I have never had much luck when going for strength rather than endurance on ab exercises. There are some machines that work your abs in the gym but I just don't know which one of them are legit not just to create show-abs rather than something that actually helps me in doing other lifts.

Ps, I have the ab-wheel and I just can not ""get it"". My back hurts no matter how I try to ""bend"" and I'm just not strong enough to do it.

My 5RM weights currently are(lbs): Squat: 180, Front Squat 125, Bench 135, Press 85, Deadlift 270. My upper body strength is pathetic, I'm aware. I'm 6'0 and 172 lbs.

I'm a 21 year old, 5'11"" male who weighed in at 180 lbs this morning. I've been doing SS since September, with absolutely no experience in a weightroom beforehand.

I competed in the unsanctioned push/pull meet (no squats were offered, to my disappointment), with about 4 other guys who were competing only in bench. I was the only competitor in the unsanctioned ""Ironman"" -- It was comforting to have a decent deadlift to make up for my pitiful bench. Overall, there were about 5 unsanctioned and about 10 100% Raw Powerlifters.

**My Lifts**

Bench

* [160 lbs.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4d3MGOMZAU)
* [175 lbs. - 15 lbs. PR!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpuMNz41ahI)
* [190 lbs. No Lift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuUvtDKwfiM)

Deadlift

* [330 lbs.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3JpcEWB4EE)
* [365 lbs. - 25 lbs. PR!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkfEsxd5Dfw)
* [390 lbs. - 50 lbs. PR!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYYJ7_Ex96w)


**What I learned**

* Knurling at a black iron gym will rip your shit up. I was not expecting that, coming from a YMCA with bars that look like they've been purposely filed down. Since I was unsanctioned they were ok with me throwing on some sweats so I didn't get my blood all over the bar. I will have to look into some knee sleeves or something next time.

* I reaaaaally need to wear more deodorant at events where I have to perform. A combination of nerves and exertion left me with some exquisite BO, much to my chagrin.

* There is only one thing more humbling than seeing a SHW bench 450 raw, and that's seeing a 114 lbs. woman bench 230 lbs. raw.

* Getting 3 medals for essentially showing up makes me feel a strange mixture of foolishness and pride (I was the only person competing in my weight class in both unsanctioned bench and unsanctioned deadlift, which also made me the winner overall of the unsanctioned Ironman as the only entrant).

* Structure and slow but steady progress works for me (SS has taught me more than just how to lift) -- I hope to apply this to going back to university in the fall.

* I set minimum goals of 1xBW bench and 2xBW deadlift for this meet. I learned that I really don't know my body as well as I thought when I missed 190 and crushed 390. It also may have something to do with the unique feeling of competing in front of a crowd: Nerves can make you fail, but adrenaline can make you succeed.

**What I plan on next**

I had a ton of fun at this meet, but I want to try something else. Oly lifting would be amazing, if I can find a coach. Maybe I'll learn some gymnastics. Or maybe I'll just end up sticking with powerlifting. After all, I haven't put my squat to the test yet...",,False,,t5_2ssmu,False,,,True,t3_pvqt8,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/pvqt8/meet_report_february_18th_2012_heartbreak_classic/,

Like most weekly threads around the fitness subreddits, I'll give a quick generic description of the thread's purpose and a guiding question, but general discussion is fine too.

Welcome to Training Tuesdays, the weekly weightroom training thread.  The main focus of Training Tuesdays will be programming and templates, but once in a while we'll stray from that for other concepts.  Feel free to ask other training and programming related questions as well, as the question is just a guide.

Since this is the first Training Tuesday of the year, I thought it would be fitting for our topic to be:

&gt;Beginner programs. Starting Strength, StrongLifts, Greyskull LP, etc.

* Have you successfully (or unsuccessfully) used one of these programs?
* What are your favorite resources, spreadsheets, calculators, etc?
* What tweaks, changes, or extra assistance work have you found to be beneficial to your training on these programs?
* Do you have any questions or general comments about these programs?

I'd love to hear your variations, or the problems you've had and how you've worked through them, and even questions from people who're struggling with the lift, obviously. In addition, I'll be sharing some articles from my vast browser history that are relevant to the lift in question. These are usually damn interesting and written by top coaches/lifters, so it's always worth a read. Please share any links you might have too!

I chose the deadlift for the simple reason that it's what our mascot/logo up in the top left appears to be doing. I'll make the next weeks thread based on either suggestions in this thread or whatever lift I happen to be thinking of next wednesday. :)

So, couple of questions everyone should answer:

* Do you have deadlifts of any variety in your program at all? (I think any exercise where you're lifting something from the floor to atleast waist height counts, so snatches, cleans and atlas stones are all in, but you're free to disagree)
* If you do, what's your BW and how much are you lifting?
* If you don't, what's your pathetic flimsy excuse, you disgrace to the lifting community? Just kidding, but you better have a good reason.
* Any insight on how you've had to tweak your style to improve your deadlift would be great.

**Background and Training**

I started lifting approximately 14 months ago, and did SS for around 7 months (I think?  I'm too lazy to go check exactly).  After that I sort of goofed off a bit, tried some of Paul Carter's style of training (which I wasn't too into), then did a bit of Texas Method style training (not exactly).  This was my first meet.

Lately I've been doing 5/3/1 while cutting for the BTFC, using the Coan/Phillipi deadlift training method for the first month or so of the cut.  It proved a poor choice (should have known, right?).  I liked the Coan/Phillipi style training, but I just didn't have enough recovery/energy to be able to handle it.  After a month on that I changed my deadlift training to 5/3/1 as well.

I lost 22 pounds for the [BTFC](http://reddit.com/r/btfc), so I wasn't exactly planning on hitting PRs.

**Meet Prep**

I did some maxing out a couple weeks ago, hitting 215 lbs on bench (though my butt came up on that one) and 305 lbs on squat.  I chose not to max my deadlift because it has been really shitty in the last month or so.  3-4 weeks ago I was having trouble pulling 365 lbs, which was really disheartening.

I took a full week completely off the week before the meet, which I was reluctant to do, but it turned out very well.  I felt really rested.  


**Lifts**


**Squat**  

Attempt 1: 275.5 lbs (125 kg), 3 white lights

Attempt 2: 303 lbs (137.5 kg), 3 white lights

Attempt 3: 319.5 lbs (145 kg), 3 white lights

I came into the meet hoping for a 310 lbs squat, so hitting this definitely exceeded my expectations.  I was really happy with it.  Watching the videos after was crazy, because I'd never before seen how deep I squat.  

**Bench**

Attempt 1: 187.2 lbs (85 kg), 3 white lights

Attempt 2: 203.7 lbs (92.5 kg), 3 white lights

Attempt 3: 214.7 lbs (97.5 kg), 3 red lights

Bench was a little disappointing only because I wanted to go 9/9, but I met my expectation.  I have problems in my left shoulder that I've been trying to rehab, and it's definitely getting better.  The pause really killed me.  As I started shedding more and more weight during my cut, I stopped training with a pause (dumb) because I was feeling annoyed at not being able to lift as much.  Also, my ass was definitely off the bench so it would have been red-lighted for that anyways.

**Deadlift**

Attempt 1: 325 lbs (147.5 kg), 3 white lights

Attempt 2: 380.2 lbs (172.5 kg), 3 white lights

Attempt 3: 413.2 lbs (187.5 kg), 3 white lights

Deadlifts!  *Fuck yes*.  These went so well.  If you look close you can see me start laughing after my third pull.  I hit a 8 pound PR on my deadlift, where the previous best was when I was at 187 lbs bodyweight.  They all felt really fast and my form hardly even broke down, maybe some bend in the back on the third one but not much.  Felt fucking awesome.

**Results**

My total was 425 kg/936.4 lbs (303.1 wilks), and 8/9 on lifts.  I was really happy with this total, as I was shooting for 900 lbs, so it definitely surpassed my expectations.  That deadlift PR really made the meet for me.  I'm not sure if I'm gonna keep cutting or if I'm going to start bulking, but I'm going to eat everything in sight for at least a week.",,False,,t5_2ssmu,1370238442.0,,,True,t3_1fkd88,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1fkd88/meet_report_uspa_mn_state_championship/,
