Then going ahead and creating this [Youtube ad](http://youtu.be/m0JF4QxPpvM) criticizing those who use photoshop as trying to distort the beauty of women. What's worse is it's insulting to the craft to say that an artist can be reduced to an action, and two, that the target was the artist whose job it was to fulfill the request not make it.  Most Photoshop work on models is done to fix lighting, make-up, and scenery to make the subject look their best. If Dove doesn't want anyone to manipulate our sense of perfection maybe they should refrain from letting their models use make up.

This whole campaign is a farce how many designers could they have possibly reached if they started this whole thing a mere 7 days ago. Its just a cheap stunt.

All this Corporate activism drives me crazy all Dove has done is create a false sense of 'good' guys vs the 'bad' guys when in reality the only reason they have this campaign is because it sells not because they are a good company. All The Dove real women campaign while successfully selling more Dove products has done little to widen the stereotypical views of beauty and is only paying some lip service to the problem. Not to mention that their ads were Photoshoped.

Dove. Owned by Unilever. Same company that owns AXE. Brands that sell their product by presenting it with highly Photoshopped bikini-clad women.

Maybe they should stop manipulating the media, in much the same way they claim the media manipulates the natural order of things.

Some articles already circulating about their new campaign.

Just my rant.

So today, I spent some time making a bunch of brushes, and I want to share them with you! 7 of the brushes are 2000x2000 the rest are max res 2500x2500. some of them are intentionally left rather transparent to allow for less or more. You may have to click 3-4 times to get the amount of opacity you want, then play with settings. 

I use brushes like these to add texture and depth to graphics. Try using it on it's own layer with a blending mode, or try using it as an eraser too!

Brushes examples and usage examples I just made:

http://img846.imageshack.us/img846/7760/blueforestwallpaperxgs4.jpg

Contemporary perception of what is considered beautiful changes all the time and is an incredibly complex social and psychological phenomena. The premise of your entire product line is one of self applied beautification, dependent on brands like Axe (owned by your parent corporation Unilever) perpetuating an endless stream of advertisements featuring artificial looking models to retain your strategic market position. 

By your logic, women consumers should feel so beautiful - *inside and out* - that they actually have no need for self applied beautification, *including* Dove products. Furthermore, you are insulting the collective intelligence of your consumer base who are smart enough to know that any large brand marketing campaign, including yours will feature professionally photographed and post processed models.

To infer that your own models and advertising does not feature any sort of professional image production and post production is disingenuous, and by extension Dove is manipulating perceptions of beauty. Any image professional, indeed your entire consumer base, can see there has been post processing work to the skin complexion and lighting from the RAW image in your advertising campaigns, albeit without judicious use of Photoshop’s Liquify tool.

If you’re looking for someone to blame, don’t blame the retouchers, or the art directors or the graphic designers as convenient scapegoats: blame the brands that engage their services and the media entities that perpetuate them; brands crucial to your continued existence as it allows to position yourself differently from your competitors.

Photoshop is used by millions every day in millions of applications that have nothing to do with engendering a false perception of beauty. 

**I challenge Dove and Ogilvy Toronto to deliver a campaign featuring ordinary women, with no professionally shot photographers in a well lit studio environment, using Microsoft Paint.**

Yours,

*PS: I don't really care how this post goes down on Reddit, I just hope someone from Dove Canada or Ogilvy Toronto reads this.*

Now I can make all the hokey money and Wall Street Journal illustrations I want!

1. First ramp up the contrast/brightness to eliminate most of the background and the subject's inner color. You want clean outlines and dark shadows.

2. Then do a black/white lines halftone,

3. then play with the threshold or contrast until the background/grays are faded out (it may need some erasering around the edges of your subject).

4. Then use some subtle Glass or Ripples to give it a little shaky-hand.

5. Blur to taste. Totally optional.

6. Layer on top of your choice of paper texture (or not) with a different layer opacity style (of course). I think I used Darken or Multiply, maybe. You'll know it when you see it.

Put in the oven and bake for 620 degrees for six hours. Rinse and repeat. Honestly the whole thing requires a bit of tinkering, but that's the basic bones of what I did.

A few notes:

* Make sure that when you create your tiling pattern that you start it from the top-left corner, or else it wont line up with the result of the mosaic filter.

* You might want to turn your shape into a pattern so it's easy to paint over the image in a grid.

* To easily turn the result into a mask, switch to the channels panel and ctrl+click a channel icon to select its transparency. You can now use this selection to create a mask on a new layer using the ""Add a Vector Mask"" button at the bottom of the layers panel.

So if you look at it I understand that they are doing a simple pan across the picture, but what they have done is split the picture into several layers, and as the camera pans, they move in decreasing speed the farther back in the plane they are, causing the picture to have more depth.

This is probably for the advanced crowd and people that are classic painting artists first and Photoshop users second.  It's basically a highlight carving rig where you use two curves to do lights and darks and then a gray card to polish off the difference.  You can use multiples rigs in multiple stages as well.  A full explanation of the technique is available from Amy Dresser here, you even get a psd:

I have a few questions for you all.



* Do you prefer we not have requests? 
* Do you prefer that people try on their own and then ask for help when they get stuck?
* Do you like requests?
* Do you despise requests?
* What do you want out of this community?


**UPDATE**: 


Alright. I've added a box in the sidebar for right now. Basically what most of you want is for people to have tried and failed before they ask for help. Most people don't mind the ""my X died and I need this retouched/colored for Y."" I will be letting that kind of request thru. If I see commercial requests, I will be removing them. This includes band posters, for-profit logo design, or ""my boss wants me to X.""


**UPDATE 2**:


I am in the process of taking over /r/PhotoshopRequests for the purpose of photoshop requests that are 100% free work. Help when you get stuck will still be here in the main community.


**UPDATE 3**:


Cannedpasta has created a subreddit for photoshop/picture-editing requests!


**The new community is [/r/picrequests](http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests).**


I have informed the [/r/favors](/r/favors) mods to redirect people to that subreddit instead of our main /r/photoshop.

Are there hardwares for sale with this specific idea in mind?

Is there any software that can make their controller hardware act as slider controllers for editing softwares?

I think hardware controllers will reduce fatigue on your mouse hand and maybe improve control accuracy. So if anybody has any info on this I will really appreciate it.

Anyways, one of my hobbies is to run ""undressing"" threads on a certain image board wherein people will post pictures of random girls they like, and I will use various techniques in photoshop to create an ""undressed"" version of them.  It is all hand-drawn by me, and I do not put random heads on pornstar bodies or anything like that.

My question isn't actually regarding the legality of doing this, as I'm pretty sure once someone uploads information you are free to manipulate it.  My question pertains to the legality of photoshopping potentially underaged girls. 

Your own moral stance aside, given that it is completely fake, would it be considered child pornography if I were to photoshop a sub 18 year old (16+) so that she/he looks naked?  I don't really do these photos for any sexual pleasure, so it is just a matter of whether or not I accept requests for photos that could be underaged (it's quite hard to tell).

Maybe /r/photoshop isn't the proper place to be asking, but what do you guys think?

Here are some examples of what I'm talking about (confirmed 18+ images), though NSFW:

1375732000.0,25,self.photoshop,1jre6g,[experiment] I sprayed NeverWet on my Wacom Intuos 3...,MCA2142,33,8,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/1jre6g/experiment_i_sprayed_neverwet_on_my_wacom_intuos_3/,"I have a 9x12 Intuos 3 that I've been using for years.  I have spilled beverages on this thing countless times, and each time, I had to crack the tablet open to clean the soda gunk out of the inside. 

A better man might suggest, that perhaps I shouldn't be drinking opened beverages while working.  This I agree with, 100%.  However, I'm a lazy bastard. 

Since my tablet is very old, and I could just replace it if I wanted, there was very little to lose with a bit of experimenting.  

I took the tablet apart, and sprayed Neverwet on the top surface as well as the bottom.  Hoping, that the next time I spill coffee on this thing, the coffee would roll right off. 

The base coat, is latex based, it turns out, and creates a very abrasive texture.  I first thought that the top coat would normalize this abrasiveness, but boy was I wrong...

There is no way, you can work on this surface.  It would be impossible.  The bottom surface, wouldn't matter, so I kept the coating on the bottom. 

Soon after it dried, I test poured some water on my wacom, and yes...  The water rolled right off at incredible speed.  

All is well, but now I have to remove the coating on the top surface.  Neverwet leaves a milky, hazy finish, and it just didn't look good.  

Lucky for me, the latex coating peels right off, as long as it isn't 100% dry.  It peeled off like Elmer's glue on your hand, after about 15 minutes. 

So...  In case anyone was wondering:

* Neverwet is pretty good for the bottom surface. 
* Unlike how the manual suggests, you don't have to sand this stuff off, to remove it.  As long as it's not completely dried. 
* Yesterday, I spilled some grape juice right next to my tablet, and had to crack open my mouse to clean it out.  My tablet was completely dry.
* I'm a clumsy bastard.

 If anyone had looked at the noise/grain in the image they would have seen this. Unfortunately no one bothered for more advanced techniques other than levels and 3D ( which is based on brightness levels anyway ).

##How it is done
* Create new layer
* Set layer to difference
* Add slight gaussian blur ( just to very slightly start noticing lines and noise
* use Cntr,Alt,Shift,E ( to duplicate visible as new layer )
adjust Levels to brighten it up.

What you'll notice by doing this correctly is that the noise/grain has a pattern. which is consistent throughout the image including that AmA paper, though lighter. Also both the horizontal and vertical 'lines' of the grain match up. 

Including the above method, you can clearly see that the person that took the photo was not a professional photographer, because of the amount of grain and lighting. And that no photoshop use for even sharpening or contrast was done.

**TL;DR** It is actually a lot harder even for a professional to have faked the original image.

I used the spot healing and clone stamp for most areas... especially on repairing the bottom of the pillar where I had to pretty much guess how it looked.

For the darker areas and shadows I used the burn tool.

So my main question is what can I do about the floor? I got totally lost... I was actually thinking about finding carpet stock at the right angle and editing it in there.


Another spot I was having trouble with is the hair and forehead area... I didn't want to use too much blur since too much blur makes it look too edited... and I didn't want to lose much sharpness.

After I was mostly complete here... I just ran it through Alien Skin Image Doc - JPEG Repair

I was born colorblind as well as a list of other visual issues including being legally blind. As far as being colorblind goes, I can see some color, but I have a impossible time trying to tell the difference between blue and green, blue and purple, black and other really dark colors, lavender from gray, etc.

I've recently started creating again and I can draw just fine, but shading and color issues are my main issues. The kind of work I want to create is intricate in details. Everything must be smooth and perfect (I have OCD too!). Realist or semi-realistic is my style. 

I've been trying to come up with something that may help me out with coloring. I've heard that some artists shade in their work using no color and then they color it all in somehow, but I've heard this can lead to artwork looking flat and without depth. I don't want to be one of those artists who took the easy way out just it was more convenient. Is there some sort of work around for this?

I also have a hard time telling when something is blended very well. I wish there was a sure fire way to figure out if I need to blend something more or if I need to add more color or whatever.

Anyone out there with any ideas?

I code professionally - so loops and things I'm ok with...

I've been having a lot of problems trying to get the API commands together in a Photoshop scripting language to produce an animation then save it out as a GIF.

I know there's two kind - layer, and keyframe... and I'm interested in the layer variety, just because the JavaScript can calculate the Easing, and keyframes itself, without needing to interface with Photoshops own animation timeline - so I guess the layer animation will be easier.

What I need is something like 4 input parameters:    
1: Number of frames.    
2: Number of layers per frame.    
3: Dimensions, X and Y.


In random pseudo code, I'd guess it would be:

---------------------

1: Create as many layers as : the animation is long X number of layers per frame. (e.g. 20 frames, with 3 layers in each: 60 layers overall)    

2: Create a new ""animation"" thing... that links 3 layers at a time to a single animation frame. (This is the Animation window in the GUI, the one where you click a frame, and it selects the right layer in the image, and each one has an attribute like ""Delay"" for it...)

3: Loop around all 60 layers, stepping 3 layers at a time.    

4: In each iteration, draw *whatever* on the 3 layers, using Easing equations, and the various load/paste image tools at ones disposal.     
Even write pixels to the image, using SIN and COS for twirly multicolor goodness!

5: Save it out to a GIF

---------------------

I probably have the pseudo code wrong in the way the animation is linked to the frames?

Could anyone point a way to any online tutorials?

Thaaaaanks!

xx

--------------------------

Edit:

For now, what I'm doing is writing each frame out to a PNG in a simple loop in a script.

Then by hand in Photoshop, I select:

**File &gt; Scripts &gt; Load files into Stack.**

Then from the animation panel flyout menu, I use:

**Make frames from layers.**

I'm hoping someone else has ran into (and fixed) this problem.

I typically ink my line art with a 3 pt standard round brush by using the pen tool and then stroking the path.  When I do free hand with my tablet I use the same brush but just up it to 4 pt which lets me match the 3 pt done by the pen tool.

For some reason when I fired up Photoshop today my tablet and Photoshop are being strange and for some reason every now and then when I start to draw a line freehand it will begin with a standard regular click (like a mouse did it) and just do a full 4 pt dot, then the line I draw from that is completely full 4 pt and the pen pressure doesn't change a thing.

Every now and then I can draw a line like I'm used to, but this click thing happens too often  and seemingly at random.

Whenever it happens a quick flash of a circle emits from the point of contact (I guess to just show ""this is clicking here"") which seems like a nice feature, but I have no idea if it's a Photoshop feature or something going on with my tablet and pen. 

Here it is sort of in action http://i.imgur.com/ES84R.jpg  Ignore the color picker, that is a result of having to ALT+PritScr.  Basically that thin grey circle in the middle is part of a radiating circle that occurs sometimes when I click on my work in photoshop with my Pen.  I think it is directly tied to whatever is causing me problems with the random behavior PS is giving me today.

I use a Tooya Pro cheap tablet that has been perfectly fine until just this morning.

Edit: I should note that when the problem occurs, here is the exact course of events:

* Regular begin the drag of my pen like I always do
* Radiating circle emits from the cursor and a full 4 pt dot is plotted

* Dragging my pen is sometimes a continuation from the full 4 pt dot and the entire line is 4 pts and doesnt change with pressure/lack of pressure

or

* Dragging my pen draws a line like I usually do but the base of it is a full 4 pts whereas the line I'm drawing fluctuates with pressure.

* when I want to undo what just happened it is usually 2 steps, undo the line and then undo the dot, they are separate occurrences that happen with one click/drag of my pen.

Edit: This seems to be related http://glennmerdan.com/2010/05/18/wacom-tablet-windows-7-circle-clicks-fix/ but I can't do the fix with Windows Home.  So it appears it is a Windows problem likely caused by an  update.  Any idea on fixing?

I ask this question because I can easily look at a web design and break it down to the necessary components to create the layout. How can I begin to look at an idea/texture/logo/etc and break it down to the various photoshop elements/processes to create it? 

I know that the simple answer is to know the tool and know it well, but I only really use it to slice images and create simple wireframes (I can do that well).

Several years ago, at the height of Photoshop 7 I wrote this tutorial on coding with Photoshop: http://www.kirupa.com/motiongraphics/ps_scripting.htm      
     
Some of the code still works, most of it needs tweaking. But I humbly think I wrote something that will give you good ideas if your workflow needs more punch than simple actions. 

It's very easy to script in Javascript. For instance, lets say you have a hundred documents opened (hey it's happened to me) and you want to copy each document as a layer on the currently opened one; here's a script that will [do that](http://i.imgur.com/9mtpo.png) (and close the rest of the documents  at the same time)

    docs = app.documents;
    ad= app.activeDocument;
    for(i = 0;i&lt;docs.length;i++){
        if(docs[i]!=ad){
            activeDocument = docs[i];
            docs[i].selectAll;
            docs[i].layers[0].copy(); 
            activeDocument = ad;
            ad.paste();
         }
    }
    while(docs.length&gt;1){
        //hackish but works
        for(i = 0;i&lt;docs.length;i++){
            if(docs[i]!=ad){
                docs[i].close(SaveOptions.DONOTSAVECHANGES); 
            }
        }
    }

__________________________________________________________________________

Open your picture in photoshop and select the pen tool - http://i.imgur.com/rIop4.jpg 

Also, make sure your pen tool settings are the same as mine, as indicated by the red arrows - http://i.imgur.com/IumVi.jpg

Now, when you left-click with the pen tool(Make sure you're only clicking and not dragging. Dragging with the pen tool will create curves, which I'm not ready to try and explain to you yet...mostly because I don't really get how to work with them myself), it will create a little box called an anchor point.  you can lay down a series of these anchor points which will be connected, like this: - http://i.imgur.com/Prddd.jpg

Notice that I'm zoomed in close to help see where the edge of the doll is.  Anyway, once you've drawn all the way around the object and closed the path, switch to quickmask mode - http://i.imgur.com/U9dn2.jpg

Make sure your foreground color is black, right-click on your picture, and select 'fill path'.  Choose the following settings - http://i.imgur.com/sEHia.jpg

Your path should fill with a transparent red color, like this - http://i.imgur.com/KBFIm.jpg 

Right-click the image again, and select 'delete path'.  The line around the doll is now gone, leaving only the masked area, filled in with red.  Now go back into normal mode(the button next to the 'quickmask mode').  You should get a 'dancing' dotted line around your object.  Now go to the top menu and 'select &gt; inverse' - http://i.imgur.com/LjGD5.jpg

And then 'new layer via copy' - http://i.imgur.com/LjGD5.jpg

You now have your object on a separate layer, probably named 'layer 1' - http://i.imgur.com/Nk9ZN.jpg

Now you can do whatever you want with the object, or the background.  I could drag that doll into another picture for example, but for now, let's change the background to black &amp; white.  Make sure you have the background layer selected and press 'ctrl' and U on your keyboard.  This will bing up the hue/saturation settings.  Turn the saturation slider all the way to -100, like so - http://i.imgur.com/6hZZm.jpg

Click 'ok', and you're pretty much done!  Here's our finished product - http://i.imgur.com/Jf5hV.jpg

This is,  of course, just one of the pen tool's many uses, but like I said, I wanted to start with something fairly basic.  I hope this little guide helps! ",,False,self,t5_2qhcb,True,,,True,t3_ko4xk,http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/ko4xk/pen_tool_for_beginners_tutorial_extracting_part/,

I'm still somewhat new to photoshop, having only recently bought my own copy. I've only ever been able to use it during my classes...so most of my experience comes from working in a limited timeframe. 

So essentially, our assignment was to create a mechanical animal; either a machine with animal parts, or the other way around. The first thing I thought of was a steampunk-style bird, and I ran with that. My source image used was this one: http://i.imgur.com/arsPy.jpg?1. It was a tad grainy for my liking, but I really liked the action and movement of the picture, as well as the lighting behind the bird's wings and head. 

So after much google-searching and picture-gathering of any steampunk-y thing I could find, and many, many hours in the computer lab, I have my final product: http://i.imgur.com/6GrJx.jpg?1.

By 'float', I mean an action which reduces the bounds of the current selection to surround only the nontransparent pixels of the layer.

For a real-world analogy, imagine I made a cat, then stretched a rubber band around it, then let it go. It would 'float' to surround the cat perfectly.

The 'Float Trick' was to select a rectangle of interest, then float it with ctrl-f, then press up-arrow to nudge it one pixel up. This nudging would cause the 'rubber-banding' action to snap the selection down to the smallest size. Then you press the down arrow to move the selection back to its proper position before you nudged it.

So, sorry for a basic question, but how is the selection-shrinking done nowadays?

I'm out of ideas. Graphics production at my company is pretty much at a standstill until I can figured this out. :( Has anyone ever had this problem before? Thank you in advance, r/Photoshop!

----- EDIT: Problem SOLVED! -----

Oh my gosh, you guys have been SO awesome. Thank you so much for your replies! Through r/Photoshop, we were able to figure out what the reason for the issue was: When images are at large enough dimensions, Photoshop limits the file types you can save them out as.

As we all know the blur tool's absolutely useless, and the smudge brush can be slow. I found that you can use the Healing Brush to simulate a sort of waterpaint-like blur that seems to work quite well for blending purposes.

Here's a quick step by step:

select the Healing Brush (shortcut:j. Otherwise, it's underneath the Spot Healing Brush)
Set the Source to 'Pattern' instead of the default 'Sampled'. Now create a new file at 10x10 pixels (I suppose 1x1px could work,haven't tried), fill it with white, select all (ctrl-a) and go to edit&gt;define pattern. Call it 'white'.
Now select this pattern in the Healing Brush, and try it out.
It doesn't blur untill you stop painting, but otherwise it works well for quick, smooth blending. It doesn't seem to blend from outside selections, which I personally find to be a plus.

One downside is that it doesn't work on masks (despite those just being b/w images...), but that's a small niggle I think.

For those who've tried it, what do you think? I only just started using this so I'm not sure if it's a good solution, but so far it seems really nice! One thing I really like about it is that you can easily define the start and endpoint for a blur, making it easy to create both small and large blurs.

I made a quick demonstration of the kind of blurring it does: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17715/PS_HealBlur.gif

As you can see, it's more like a gaussian blur than what you'd achieve with the smudge brush, which can come in handy at times.",,False,self,t5_2qhcb,False,,,True,t3_m0k1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/m0k1h/using_the_healing_tool_as_a_blurblend_tool/,

If the selected area in your mask has some excess background all around its edges, instead of refining the edge bit by bit, you can clean it all up pretty easily.

Select the Layer Mask, go into Levels, and increase the Shadows. 

*(Because of the Black/White nature of Layer Masks, where White is opaque and Black is transparent, increasing the Shadows will cause the Black to close in around the White, which makes the selected area smaller, removing the excess background.)*

Example: Lets say that I have a picture consisting of 10,000 pixels and I wanted to select the top 10% of the brightest pixels. If I did this correctly there will be 1000 pixels selected.

By 'select' I mean it has the marching ants around it. In this case there should be tiny pixel-sized islands of marching ants all over my picture.

I know that I can sample colors and get ""close"" to this idea using Color Range, but for what I'm doing I need to be able to specify a range of pixel intensities. It doesn't have to be in the form of percentage, but it needs to work in the same manner.

For instance, it may say there there are 10,000 pixels in the picture, and then it allow me to select pixels 'a' through 'b' where a and b are numbers and where 1 represents the darkest pixel and 10,000 in this case represents the brightest pixel. So I might tell it to highlight pixels 9,500 to 10,000. This would be highlighting the brightest 5% of the pixels in that photo.

Once again, I'm not interested in coming close with a method that tends to highlight bright areas. I *need* it to be able to do what I said.

First, understand that this community of photographers all have a similar editing style. Almost every point of their photography wouldn't be nearly as appealing without the editing. I don't think it's a bad thing, by any means. However, this has led me to never truly believe in anything I see in the photographs. So how can I create that dust particle effect? I found one tutorial on YouTube. But it's not what I'm looking for..

Macbook Pro Vs Windows laptops, what's going to get me the best bang for my buck?

I would like to keep it sub £1,500; If I go Apple, should I settle for the higher clocked 'old' 13"", or stump up the extra cash for the retina display and SSD, but lower clock speed. If I go PC, is the Lenovo X1 Carbon going to cut the mustard for my photo and video editing needs? If not, what other choices would you recommend?

I'm planning on keeping the screen size small for portability and getting a large monitor to plug into, so 13""/14"" on the laptop is fine.

I can't for the life of me find out where that is in CS5, the info box would be the most logical place but no luck there.  

2- On that same vein JPS could also easily convert an image to any number of colors you wanted - how can I do that in Photoshop?

3- I'm often using the pen tool with grey scale images but the tool lines are also grey making the job a chore and a big strain on my eyes.  Is there a way to change the color of the curves made by the pen tool? 

4- Maybe it's just me but every time I switch to the brush tool CS5 forces me to click somewhere before I can use the bracket keys to change its size - is this a bug or a feature?  Maybe a re-install? 

Thanks in advance for your answers and patience with this PS noob.

Hey reddit, I know there are some amazingly creative people here and I'd love to see a redditor win this contest.

The deadline for the first 2 rounds have ended, but there are still three more chances to win $10K. Here's how it works:

* Create something using any Adobe CS5.5 product
* Create an account, and submit an image, movie, or PDF showcasing your creation.
* Celebrity Judges (Rivers Cuomo, DeadMau5, Jake and Amir, and Scott Dadich) decide on the 10 finalists
* The 10 finalists are posted and community voting decides who wins  the $10K
* All other finalists win $550
* Each time you vote you are entered into a daily drawing for a $50 Visa Gift Card

In the final round of the contest (Student Choice) ALL entries from the first four rounds are posted and community voting determines the winner.  So even if you don't get selected as a finalist in the earlier rounds, you still have a chance to win $10K.


Some tips &amp; other important stuff:

* You must be a college student to enter
* If you don't have Adobe CS5.5 you can download a free 30-day trial or purchase it at an **80% discount** using the links on the site.
* If you're from Germany or the UK, click on the links in the footer to go the appropriate international site.
* Using trademarks, logos, or images of other people are not permitted, but narwhales baconing at midnight are cool.
* See FAQs &amp; Official rules for all the details.

Most of the entries so far have been photos, but anything is fair game. So feel free to take a screenshot of your killer website design or use video to showcase a flash app (or anything else you can think of)

Good Luck Reddit!

**TLDR: 1)Make something cool with CS5.5  2) Enter the contest  3)????  4)PROFIT!!!!**

* They want to use Photoshop for creating graphics, not manipulating photos

* It's CS4

I can see how this would be useful for most editing, but it's really annoying for what I need to do because then I can't be accurate as to where I want the marquee to end, since most of the window view is past the image itself. Is there any way I can disable this buffer, or at least reduce it? 

I'm also having another annoyance with making marquees. When I'd make one in 6.0, and I extend it beyond the window view, the window view quickly moves to the very edge of the image. In CS6 though, it's much slower. Again, useful for general editing, really bad for me. Can I change this as well?

3. Adjustments/Hue and saturation/colorize

Are there any professionals here who stick to using a mouse?

Also, because it popped into my head as I was typing this: although I don't own one, is it possible to use an iPad (or similar) as a graphics tablet?",,False,self,t5_2qhcb,False,,,True,t3_mlw6z,http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/mlw6z/question_what_are_the_advantages_of_a_graphics/,

Say you use the shape tool and draw a nice, sharp little vector-based rectangle. Now say you want to re size it. You do, and all of a sudden the edges go fuzzy! WTF. Why??

Well I don't know why Photoshop is stupid like this, but the only solution I had found up to today was making sure I was at 100% zoom (no more, no less), when drawing or transforming a vector shape. This works, but it's hard when you're working with a small shape with a 1px stroke that you want to tweak ever so slightly. At 100% zoom, a 100px x 100px rectangle isn't very big on screen.

So I did some more searching and found that you can stop Photoshop from being stupid like this:

* turn on the grid (cmd/ctrl+' or view&gt;show&gt;grid)
* make sure snap to grid is turned on (view&gt;snap to&gt;grid)
* Making the grid lines at 1px increments is a good idea also: preferences&gt;grids, guides &amp; slices... under grid choose gridline every 10px, subdivisions 10, or 1 and 0 would probably work)


Now you can draw and re size your shapes without Photoshop getting in your way. Hope this helps somebody else!",,False,self,t5_2qhcb,False,,,True,t3_ihmh5,http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/ihmh5/stop_photoshop_from_annoyingly_antialiasing_your/,

I do a lot of work with textures for 3d and I do a lot of grime/smudge and splatter types effects. I have collected a nice selection of lovely brushes over the years.

What I wondering is, if there is an extension that will allow photoshop to cycle through different brushes as I paint?

For example, suppose I'm painting up a texture for a rusty iron panel. Rather than manually select 5 or so suitable brushes and slowly build up my texture; Is there a way that I can select some suitable brushes before hand and have photoshop randomise them the same way you can vary the opacity, color, angle &amp; size of each brush stroke?

Is it maybe just duplicating the image then finding a way to move things around? I just don't know the easiest way. All I can think of is manually using the polygonal lasso. There's gotta be an easier way.

Basically, I just want to follow the procedure shown on [this video](http://vimeo.com/25716593#t=120) (around 2:00)

He makes a very quick draft then he creates a new layer and lowers it's opacity so he can trace the draft, however, in my case this new layer appears completely transparent (grey and white squares), so in order to fix this, I use my bucket tool with white color to make the background white (I'm not sure if this is the correct method to change the canvas color) then he starts tracing more correct lines but when I need to use the Eraser tool, just like he does in the video, this tool also erases my background (I'm sure I'm using the normal Eraser tool not the Eraser Background one).
