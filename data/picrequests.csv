Seriously Reddit, you've once again proved that the internet does in fact contain a whole lot of people who are pretty fucking cool. It really does mean a lot to me that random strangers took time to do this stuff... and it let me take a break from all the negative thinking, in order to focus on some positive stuff. Also, thanks to everyone who shared their story with me. I really appreciate it. At a time when I felt pretty fucking alone, you made me feel less so. Thanks Reddit!

Hi Reddit,
I realize I'm opening myself up to a world of additional pain here... but I'm hoping Reddit will continue to demonstrate that not everyone is terrible.
To make a long sad story a shorter one, my dad died about a month ago of ALS. My abusive/personality disordered mother decided to destroy all the photo's in existence of my father and I together. As you may have guessed, this has fucked me up a bit.
So Reddit... can you possibly pick two photo's and make it appear as though we're actually in them together? I realize this is a difficult mission. I also realize that by posting as many photos as I have of myself and my father on the internet, I'm likely to be further hurt... but I'm willing to risk it. Anyway, feel free to make a photo of us doing a typical father-daughter thing, or something entirely atypical (although hopefully not hateful/offensive).

Perhaps not numbers but levels? ""Novice, Adept, Master, WIZARD"" etc. For WIZARD you would have to send me something quite impressive, but as for the others I will leave it up to your own personal honesty.

This is our local homeless man who resides around my old workplace. It's a Trader Joe's, so he goes around calling all of us Mr. Trader Joe's himself! So we nicknamed him Mister Trader Joe. He's always blessed and always eager to wash a window or carry your groceries to your cart. It's always been his dream to travel the world, and since I don't have that kind of money, I figured the next best thing would be to have him shooped all over the world in a fantastic collage of landmark scenes! I plan on printing them out and showing him these photos, so make them schnazzy! Let's see what kind of skills you've got Reddit (if time allows, don't go wasting your Sunday off or anything).

The more creative, the better. Seeing as how my skills go about as far as pasting text into paint files, I'm clearly not the one to be doing these kinds of extremely skilled tasks. Anything posted here WILL be shown to him, so if you can get a laugh out of it, all the better.

First of all, know I am writing this post as a service. I am not singling anyone out or criticizing anyone.

Picrequests used to be /r/photoshoprequests.  I am not certain why the name was changed, maybe a mod can answer this, but altering and/or restoring images with photoshop or some other comparable software is what we do here.  

Drawings, concept art, and graphic design, Photoshop and GIMP support have their own subreddits.  Keep in mind that these types of requests are often filled here anyway.  Sometimes it's fun and challenging to take on a new or unique task like this, but limiting yourself to this subreddit for these types of requests could be a lost opportunity for something amazing from a subreddit that is dedicated to the task at hand.

**[EDIT:** I really appreciate the attention this post is getting (damn it to hell for being a non-karma generating self-post) and I thought I would like to clarify my position on this matter.  I am not a mod of this sub, nor am I pretending to be.  This post was just intended to be a PSA stating my (and, I hope I am correct and not over-extending myself in saying, most of your) position on this matter.  Of course anyone is free to shop as many dicks they want into any request they get (Oh, god... I can see a novelty account being created as I type this... what have I done?) but from I have seen over the past few months I've been contributing here, most of us seem to be better than that.  I don't think more rules is the answer, and from what I have seen, we the contributors aren't really the problem. When I say not to ""expect"" a dick, it means just that.  Not that it will not happen, just that most of us don't roll like that. **TL;DR: Thanks to most of you regular contributors for staying classy and making me enjoy this sub that much more]**

I am requesting someone use photoshop to make a family portrait. Willing to pay. Story in text.,cowgrlbabe19,68,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests/comments/1bjtoy/my_birthmother_died_in_a_drive_by_gang_shooting/,"Last summer, I had come up with an idea of getting all of my grandmother's children together and getting a family portrait taken. My grandmother had put up 2 kids for adoption when they were babies and they both found her a few years ago. So now that everyone is back together, I thought it would be an awesome mother's day gift to her since she doesn't have any full family portraits. 

Tragically, in December, my birth mother (my grandmother's 2nd oldest) died in a drive by gang shooting (I have provided the link to the news story below as proof, I can provide further if its not enough). This year has been really rough on my grandma and know that if she could have that one family portrait, it would be something she could cherish forever as she has never had her full family together.   

I came up with the idea of photoshopping a portrait together since it's the only other way I could make this happen. Although I just got photoshop, I do not know how to use it at all and know I wont know how by mother's day. 

I AM WILLING TO PAY for this to be done. There would be 7 people altogether in the photo (6 kids plus my grandmother). I have multiple photos of each individual so there would be options. 

I hope I have found the right subreddit for such a request. If not, please point me in the direction I need to go. Thank you. If someone is actually interested in taking this request on, let me know and I will create an IMGUR album with the photos I have. 

http://ktla.com/2012/12/13/woman-murdered-on-an-l-a-city-sidewalk/#axzz2PLqUNx85   


EDIT**** I did not expect such a reaction to my request. Just shows how awesome of a community Reddit is. Thank you guys so much for even showing interest. I have put together an album that has as many family photos as I could find in a short amount of time, but hopefully they provide enough options. Here is the link:

http://imgur.com/a/w9qW6

The family portrait would include (order is oldest to youngest):
Myra (my grandmother),
Terri,
Lori (my birthmother),
Sherri (my adopted mother),
Bunny,
Kerry, &amp;
James.

If at all possible ( i know a lot of the pictures are not good quality) but I would like it to look like as much of a professional photo as possible, but the main point is just to have them all in one photo and it look like as much of a realistic photo as possible. As far as a price range goes, I really don't have much so just tell me your price and I can let you know if I can afford it or not.

Here is a headshot of him: (http://i.imgur.com/Zr2c7.jpg)
I would be so happy if you took this pic, altered, added text, and created a memorial photo/design that everyone could use as a profile picture in honor of him (sorry its cropped, it's the most recent photo I have of him). I don't want it to be a blatant picture of his face though... Maybe try outlining his head, or create a silhouette out of his head/face, making the text the main focus of the memorial. Do it in a way that his presence is still noticeable in the design, if that makes any sense. Minimal, clean and legit!

My grandfather's farm was on Blossom Point, until they booted him to make it a Navy station in WWII.  Best thing that ever happened to the family as it freed him from being a tenant farmer to the Catholic Church and got him his own land.  Brother Joseph would come around at rent time and drink tea and say, ""Have you got anything for me today, Roy?""  Then he would take the rent and blow it at the track.

I show up every so often to work on the requests i think are sentimentally important, and pose me a fun challenge.  However, I have seen a really annoying trend start to crop up in requests.  I'm speaking of the dreaded word ""easy"".

There are many posts that include statements like ""I don't have photoshop, but this is a really easy request"".  I wouldn't mind that if the requests were a quick crop or desaturation, but what I more commonly see is:

*I don't have photoshop, but this should be easy.  I want a photo of abraham lincoln riding on a uhura-raptor (black utah-raptor in a startrek uniform, with an earpiece), with birds for arms, an AK-47 in one beak-hand and my friend's head in the other.  It needs to look perfect, so I can show my dog.*

This bothers me a little.  Photoshop is a tool to create art.  Those who use it are artists (at varying skill levels).  you wouldn't say: ""i don't have paint, or i'd do it... make me a Sistine Chapel!  it'll be easy!"".  Similarly, you should not pre-evaluate the worth of anyone's work, in a field you know nothing about.

I believe that a note to this effect would be a good addition to the sidebar or posting page.

Brief foot-chase, other units arrived &amp; they caught him.  They called me &amp; brought me on-scene to ID the guy.

I tried doing this once before around Christmas but forgot to post the pictures like an idiot.

My niece, Brooklyn, was born this past November with a disorder called trisomy 18, or Edward's syndrome. This disorder left her with seizures, a hole in her heart, and a lot of other issues. The most noticable effect of this disease has been her feeding and oxygen tubes. A constant reminder or her terminal disease, my sister and brother in law have barely seen her face without this medical equipment attached.

Brooklyn passed away this morning. I was wondering if anyone would be willing/able to Photoshop away these tubes in some pictures of her. I think it would mean a lot to them to have some pictures without these tubes. You can find some pictures below, just as an example of what you would be working with.

I dont have much, but I could PayPal $50 to someone if they can make some pictures look great. Message me if you're interested, and I can send you the photos I would like to be edited.

If anyone is interested in reading more about their story, you can find it at their blog about Brooklyn at abchull.WordPress.com. please don't comment on their blog if you do read through it.

**EDIT** Wow. You guys are amazing. These pictures look great. So many of you have messaged me wanting to help and have had very kind words. You can find the other pictures in an imgur album below. Any one of you all who has wanted to help can have at it. I just put a bunch of pictures in some imgur albums.

We've changed some things and updated some of our rules. Make sure to read the sidebar.

---

###Rules
* **NSFW requests:** Make sure you mark them as NSFW. Some people don't like them, so be aware of that. We aren't going to stop you, but don't expect many results. Don't ask us to make people nude.


* **Cyberbullying:** Please report these threads to us! Do not do requests that are obviously mean spirited. If you are caught posting a cyberbullying request, **you will be banned**.


* **Homework:** This isn't the place to post your homework assignment for us to do. We aren't going to do your art homework for you. Need an image fixed for a PowerPoint? Sure. Need a sketch of your dog for class? Not okay.


* **Watermarks:** We don't remove watermarks. They are there for a reason. Doesn't matter if it's your photo from a professional photographer or an image you found online.


* **Forging documents:** This is a **MAJOR** bannable offense. **If you post or fulfill one of these, you will get banned. No exceptions.** There are major legal implications with this and no one wants /r/picrequests to get deleted because of it.


* **Be Nice:** Sometimes it's okay to joke around in a request, but sometimes it isn't. Tags will help with this. As far as posters go, if the OP is being a jerk let us know. This is a fun, happy place for people to practice photoshop and get requests fulfilled. If it stops being fun, report it to us and we will evaluate the situation. 

---

###Reporting Links
Please report any offending links. Mods can't read every thread and every comment. That report button and sending us [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23picrequests) too is a great way to get our attention.

---

###Link Flair
You can now tag your posts as Serious or Silly with link flair. After you make your post, click on flair and select what you want!

I am not singling anyone out or criticizing anyone.

Picrequests used to be /r/photoshoprequests.  I am not certain why the name was changed, maybe a mod can answer this, but altering and/or restoring images with photoshop or some other comparable software is what we do here.  

Drawings, concept art, and graphic design, Photoshop and GIMP support have their own subreddits.  Keep in mind that these types of requests are often filled here anyway.  Sometimes it's fun and challenging to take on a new or unique task like this, but limiting yourself to this subreddit for these types of requests could be a lost opportunity for something amazing from a subreddit that is dedicated to the task at hand.   

This being said, I will attempt to broaden your horizons with a list of subs (and a few external links).

**Drawing Requests**

/r/ICanDrawThat

/r/CanYouDrawThisForMe

/r/DrawForMe

/r/DrawIt

/r/DrawMyTattoo

**Colorization**

-------

If you know of any good subs that should be added, just holla!  

Also, when submitting here to /r/picrequests please try to do as much of your own legwork as possible (i.e. finding/providing source photos) or have your design ideas at least somewhat thought out. Also, for the love of all things, please read the sidebar.

Thanks!

**TL;DR** If we can't or won't do what you want, check the list for someone who will.

My boyfriend, Ron, is a female-to-male transman. His parents lovingly dressed him in pink as an infant and grew his hair long when he was a kid. Pictures from his older years (5-6 and above) are viable as he ""passes"" as male to those who aren't aware he's trans. 

We're moving in a few weeks and went through his storage locker and found loads of old photos that he's hid away for years because he's ""stealth"" or not out as trans at work or to the majority of our friends/my family. However! I'd like to put up some of these photos alongside the ones from my childhood. 

So, that's where you come in /r/picrequests I know that you guys can work some serious magic. 

There are six photos in **[this album](http://imgur.com/a/aDlky)**. I've ranked them in order of how much I'd like to have them done. 

The first three are pictures from him as an infant. He's wearing pink clothes. I'd love to have them re colorized to blue or green. 

The fourth photo is a baseball photo. He looks fairly male, but is self conscious of his bangs. Sports were a big part of his life and I'd love for him to be comfortable letting me hang up this picture.

The last two he has long effeminately cut hair. I'm not sure if it's possible to realistically give him a masculinized hair cut, but I figure if anyone can, it's you guys and gals. 

Final note: Yes! He knows I'm doing this. He actually did the scanning ;)

Thank you, you guys are awesome!

TL;DR: [**Here**](http://imgur.com/a/aDlky) are the photos of my boyfriend as a youngin. I'd love for you guys to make his clothes blue in 1, 2, &amp; 3, get rid of his bangs in 4 and shorten/masculinize his hair in 5 &amp; 6.

Go to your local library and ask for help. Tell the person that you want the photo scanned at the highest quality so that it can be restored. Also scanning a photo is probably free.

It really is VERY important to get a high quality photo when you scan. If you want to preserve or fix a photo isn't worth doing well? It is also the least you can do for the people wanting to fix the photo. Restoring photos professionally is VERY expensive so those of us fixing photos are essentially losing quite a bit of money when we restore a photo for free.

(x-post from AskReddit),nagumi,36,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests/comments/v90ee/request_my_cat_died_i_loved_him_more_than/,"I adopted Jones when he was four days old, right after getting out of the hospital. I was really depressed and didn't see much of a point in living. Jones gave me purpose. In fact, the day he was neutered I stuck around the clinic and volunteered, which led me to a career change - I'm now a dogsitter! Without Jones I'd be a totally different person today, and now he's dead.


Here's what I wrote on my facebook right after it happened:
-----
My cat Jones, my baby, was just killed by one of the dogs I'm fostering. I have never felt pain such as this, and I hope none of you ever did.

I got Jones when he was four days old. I had just been released from the hospital and I felt that I had no real will to live. Taking care of Jones gave me purpose. He changed my life completely... Without him I would be a very different person today. I am a much poorer person now. I love him with all my heart and owe him everything.

And now he's gone. In a few minutes the man will arrive to take him to be buried and he'll be gone from my life forever.


I love you, Jones, and I will forever.
-----


You see, Jones really did change my life. The day he was neutered I stuck around to volunteer, which led to a career change for me, and eventually to me owning my own business (I'm a dog boarder). I really do owe him everything.

So Reddit, I need your help. I want to get a tattoo of his pawprint on my wrist (I'm a girl, so it's not too tacky). I don't have a ready pawprint, but I went over all my old photos of him and found a bunch of pictures where you can see the bottom of his foot. Ideally I want his front paw, but beggars can't be choosers. I don't have the photoshop mojo to convert these photos into an accurate, greyscale representation of his pawprint, so I come to you, Reddit! Please help me honor my beloved Jones' memory.


Here are the photos I found. The last is my favorite picture of Jones, so you can all see my wonderful boy in happier times.

* Tag your requests, offers, and help posts with [Request], [Offer], or [Help].


* **Thank the people that help you and toss them an upvote.**


* When you make a request, it **MUST BE A SELF POST**. Include what you want done with detail in the body of the post.


* **Tag NSFW posts as such!**


* Do **not** always expect free work. Many people still honing their skills will help you, but professional photoshoppers may ask for compensation.


* **WE WILL NOT FORGE DOCUMENTS, ID CARDS, OFFICIAL PAPERS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. THAT INCLUDES CHANGING OR REMOVING A SIGNATURE'S BACKGROUND.  PEOPLE REQUESTING THESE THINGS WILL BE BANNED!**


*****

**Please note the second rule here.** Remember to thank people that help you. [This post sums it up pretty well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests/comments/mwujl/scumbag_pic_requesters/) People spend time on your requests and feel unappreciated when you don't take the time to thank them.

Another problem we have been having is people trying to embarrass people or make offensive requests. **We aren't going to edit your ex-girlfriend's picture so you can black mail the person.** That is wrong. 


**PLEASE REPORT THESE KINDS OF POSTS.**

****

Last thing. In regards to paid requests, please make sure to tell the mods how you are going to pay and specify it in your post.

**EDIT/UPDATE:**


I would like to thank everyone who has helped me and has referred me to this subreddit! I really appreciate the help as I am clueless on photoshop. I will reply each and one of you individually.
For those of you who are curious about the pictures and the history of it, my mom left Vietnam in the late 70s? around her mid/early 20s alone with her niece after the Vietnam war and was a refuge in thailand for a bit. Since then, she hasn't seen her father and unfortunately, he passed away before she got to go visit him again. I found these pictures while i was in vietnam and brought it here to the united states. I believe these are the only family pictures they have when they were young. My mom is the second to youngest one (in the bigger group picture).
but heres recent family picture of them at their unintentional ""reunion"" from 2010 if you guys wanna see (i wasnt there)

I was wondering if somebody could create the cover for me.

I want the cover to be a closeup of someone's eye, and in the pupil, I want a war scene. Like dead soldiers or soldiers shooting. Something like that- humans fight an alien race in the book. On the top of the image I want it to say ""Trapped"" and the bottom to say ""Adam Awdish""

For whoever makes the best design, I will send a free copy of the book to once it is published. It will go for about $2 or $3 USD.

Thank you all so much for supporting a very young and new author.

**EDIT:** If you would like, you can also include your name to be mentioned as the illustrator. Thanks again for anybody who can help me out.

**EDIT:** The people fighting are rebels in the story, but I never describe them, so either real soldiers like I have seen so far or more rebel like soldiers are okay. I just want to clear that up in case someone has a picture and they aren't sure if it will work. And the aliens are somewhat similar to the alien things in Dead Space if you were all wondering. Again, thanks for all of your input.

**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for your submissions, they are awesome! Anyway, it is 9am where I live right now, and I expect to submit my novella late tonight. So, unless something comes up where I submit earlier, more entries are welcome as I will make my choice at the end of the day.

**EDIT:** Here is the book's description if you guys are interested:

&gt;*In the close future, Esther and Doc are strange friends, Esther being a teenage boy and Doc being a quirky scientist. When Doc finishes his latest gadget, called the Doc Block, the pair travels to the year 3187. To their surprise, an alien-cyborg race is trying to conquer Earth. Esther and Doc join a rebel force to help fight back the invasion, but when things take a turn for the worse, Esther finds he may not really be who he thinks he is.*

**FINAL UPDATE:** Hello everyone! Well, I have made my decision; I am going with the cover art that Getusom32 made. I am about to finish the upload, it should be available for purchase by tomorrow, and I am lowering the price to about $1 or $1.50 USD. I will say that you are still welcome to post more, as I can change the cover art at any time. You all mean so much to me- after all, I am not even 18 and I am about to be a published author. You were all a part of my dream and I can't thank you enough. For your help, message me or comment your email and I will send you a copy free of charge. Thank you all!

My wife's grandmother (Nana Joyce) is 89 years old. She's an absolutely wonderful woman who we love very much. She has a framed set of two pictures that she treasures. I was thinking it would make for an amazing gift for her if they were able to be colourized/touched up. I know it's asking a lot, but my Photoshop skills are nowhere near adequate. She's currently in the hospital (she's doing well and will be home by the end of the month), so I took the opportunity to sneak into her apartment and borrow the pictures so I could scan them without her knowing.

The first picture is one of Nana's mother and her brother Frank. I'm not sure exactly when the picture was taken, but I'm sure it was during WWII. They were living in Britain and Frank was a member of the British Armed Forces. I believe this photo was taken shortly before Frank 'shipped off to fight the Nazis'.

**Image 1** JPG - [http://db.tt/O6gb5lrL](http://db.tt/O6gb5lrL)

The second picture in the frame is of Frank's grave. He was killed by a German sniper in Heverlee Belgium, in 1944 (at least that's what was handwritten on the back of the second photograph). I don't know exactly what it says on the gravestone, but I do know the name is ""F. Robinson"".

**Image 2** JPG - [http://db.tt/WgMyTWJ5](http://db.tt/WgMyTWJ5)

The first image is about 3.5x4.5 inches in size, and the second one is about 3x4 inches in size. I scanned both pictures at 600 dpi and saved each in 3 different formats (JPG, PNG, and TIF). I set up a Dropbox containing both pictures in each of the 3 formats (so 6 pics in total).

**Dropbox (JPG,PNG,TIF)** - [http://db.tt/FgsG0T6g](http://db.tt/FgsG0T6g)

Again, I know this may be asking too much, but if possible, what I would LOVE is the first photo in colour and restored, and the second photo restored (and the colour blotch on the right side of the image removed). If the resolution is high enough, I'd like to enlarge them to 5 by 7 inches, but understand if that's not a possibility. If that's not possible, maybe 4 by 6 inch would be?

It was brought to our attention that people are claiming they are willing to pay for a photoshop request or drawing, but are only doing so to bring more traffic into their post. The new system will work like verified posts in [/r/iama](/r/iama). You will message the moderators saying you want to verify that you will do a paid request and you get a green circle next to your post. That way, people will be sure you are willing to pay instead of fishing for more traffic.

***People Working on Paid Requests***

* Watermark your image or only show a thumbnail. Your time is valuable and no one likes being taken for a ride.

* Post in the thread or work thru PMs. Notify us of any issues between parties in the thread.

* **Let us know when you are done if payment was received or not.** While we cannot force anyone to pay up, we can black list them to try to prevent it from happening again.


***People Paying for Paid Requests***

* **Do NOT use a throwaway account.** We need to make sure you are a living breathing human being and that you will be able to pay up at the end of the request. The best metric we have is to see how long you have been on the site and how active you have been.

* After you post your request, **[send the mods mail using this link.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=%23picrequests&amp;subject=Paid+Verification)**

* While not limited to **PayPal**, make sure whatever payment service you will be using is large and reputable. **You must tell the mods what service you will be using as part of the verification.**

* If you do not pay the person doing the work for you, you will be banned.

***Final Notes***

It is ultimately between the two parties to decide if a transaction will be done. **The mods cannot force someone to pay,** so you are at your own risk. These types of requests aren't that popular on this reddit anyway, but we would like to provide a system for those who are willing to pay/profit on more advanced requests.




***TL;DR:*** **If you want to pay someone for a request, message the moderators first to verify your post. If you want to get paid for helping someone, make sure they are verified and take steps to protect your time investment.**",,False,,t5_2scp1,True,,camera,True,t3_k7zvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests/comments/k7zvl/new_paid_request_verification_system/,moderator

Unofficial r/bicycling representative here.

A few months ago our subreddit(s) experienced a unique tragedy. One of our own moderators (Harry, also known as no_numbers_here) was struck while riding his bicycle home from work. He was not wearing a helmet. He was 18 years old, an active redditor, a much loved bicycle shop employee and a successful college student. 

It particularly moved the community. In fact, even writing about all of this kind of bothers me, as there is alot of guys who knew him alot better; thats besides the point.

At the time we did something called a 'ghost bicycle' to our logo - visible here. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/

The white bicycle is a universal reminder/memory for fallen cyclists, generally placed where the cyclist was struck.

It has been about 2 months, and it is time to move onto something with a positive message.

We need the current logo kept AS - IS, with the bicycle being turned black, the alien smiling, and most importantly, wearing a bicycle helmet. 

I am really hoping we could get some help., have somebody step up to the plate, and leave harrys legacy that of one of saftey. All the gear, all the time.

Most kids were terrified of him (he was 6'3"" and weighted around 230) but my mom would comfort them, telling them it was OK, and to go get a piece of candy. Dad would wait for a really shy kid, and grunt or shift his hands when they got close, scaring them to death. Many, many kids would run away screaming.

After a few years word got around our small town and the local newpaper took this picture and ran the story.

She didn't know who to ask, so I said maybe we could ask the internet.  I got a rather puzzled look from her...

http://i.imgur.com/paj0Tvt.jpg

The story behind the pic (from my wife): 

Kevin died April 5, 2013. In his twenties (early 90s) he was diagnosed with and beat leukemia. The price was a partially paralyzed heart. In July 2012 he and his wife offered to purchase a home in North Carolina (US) to be closer to great medical care and family. The house they wanted was a short sale and the bank involved drew out the process for many, many months. During the bank's drawn out process, Kevin's kidneys failed and shortly after his leukemia returned.  Aside from that, a mystery illness kept him in ICU for 4 months while each major organ system failed one after another. He was put on a respirator and drug induced coma. 

April 4, 2013, a short 8 months after they placed the offer, the bank approved their offer to purchase the home. Kevin couldn't talk at this point due to complications and signed the symbol for a house to his wife. He put that symbol to his heart and then pushed his hands to her heart. Less than a day later, April 5, 2013, he died. While going through his belongings, his widow discovered this photo - it's the last photo of them before Kevin's first bout of illness. It's wallet sized. She didn't know he kept it all these years and her wish is to have a larger version framed in their home in NC. She just officially closed on the home April 19, 2013, 15 days after his death.

The name is Sinopsis (a play on words of Synopsis obviously) and I have been made a mod of our little subreddit, isn't that fantastic? Well since I'm now a mod I guess you should all know a bit about me:

I am a computer freak, like most on Reddit. I have about 11 machines in my household and a lot of free time thanks to my job being well paying and working from home. I have the time and knowledge to make our little subreddit much larger and definitely cooler looking. I have made dozens of requests and will shamelessly admit that I have made some money off of this subreddit from kind posters (thanks to anyone who payed me!!! :))

I work in HTML and I am familiar with CSS, not as much as html but I can implement a lot of cool things for our subreddit. 

I have worked in photoshop sense back when CS2 came out, have taken dozens of classes and spent years perfecting the way I work. I also work in Sony Vegas (video editing and creation) and I am just now starting on Adobe After Effects (dear god some of that stuff is wicked and confusing). So any questions based on Photoshop or tutorials that I recommend just ask away and I'll send you some of the things that taught me what I know, and hey maybe if you're EXTRA nice I'll see what I can do about getting you Photoshop and a little something called ""Photoshop Top Secret"" (google it) ;). (Considering making a photoshop contest and the prize being a copy of Photoshop and Photoshop Top Secret.)

Well, that's about all for now. Do not be alarmed as the subreddits layout begins to change, I will be testing different things over the next few days and I hope you all enjoy what I'll be doing.

I was thinking it would be beneficial to those starting out if we could post some tips on what we do.

* Personally, I tend to rely on the clone tool heavily.
* I use a very large size (&gt;50) and nearly always have the edge set to 100.
* Moving the source so it's not always the same distance and angle helps avoid that repeated look.
* (Especially if you're looking to re-create an edge) Don't be afraid to find a spot in the image that's similar, then copy, paste, rotate, skew, and erase until it blends well.
* Often I find Photoshop is overkill for what needs to be done, and I use Fireworks instead. I just enjoy that application more.

But one of the biggest problems is that i don't have Photoshop. And I'm writing this from a friends computer. And I'm on vacation in Maine which is basically surrounded by forest, which would make great spots to take photos to shop slender into them.

Like for the first photo i would like Slenderman mixing in with the trees. And very hard for people to spot him. And for him to be very far out in the background

Same with the second photo. Mixing in with the trees (Except this time in the far background, just like with the first photo) Its pretty much crucial that he has to be in the background. Very far out and hard to spot.

Thanks for reading this!

(Also, credit will be given when the prank is finished. I don't want people to think that I'm a photoshop master just because i photoshopped slendy in some photos. And in return i will give out Upvotes to EVERYONE who participates in this. Even the photos i won't use that others submitted will still get Upvotes. Thank you for your time)

I immediately got a call from him asking what happened. I told him some guy tried to swoop over 2 lanes while I  was breaking at a yellow and hit me. He kept asking questions, where, when etc. but I could tell it started to sink in because his voice got depressed. after about 5 mins of going over the story I told him I had to talk to the cops and hung up. I called him back 5 mins later and he sounded so quite and upset that I thought it would be mean to let it go any longer. I eventually bursted out laughing with my other coworker in the car and told him that it was a prank... he didn't get it, and just sounded confused until I told him that I had someone had Photoshop'd the picture of his car.

I've read a bit of his rough drafts and he's told me the concept, and it sounds really cool. He gets very passionate when he talks about his story and I can tell how much he wants to actually publish it. 

He's not very versed in image editing and when I asked he said that Paint is the only thing he can really understand. 

I scanned his original ""master"" copy (with his permission) because a while ago I told him I would try to make an editable version. I tried, but I discovered that I'm terrible at photo editing as well. The land borders were just too jagged to get right. 

**Basically what I'm asking for is an outline of the land borders that he can then edit and play around with in Paint.** I'm sure from there he can figure out how to add city locations and such. His birthday is in 10 days and I know this would be the perfect gift for him. 

Thanks for reading all of this! I'm not even sure if this is possible, but if it is I would be VERY appreciative for the help. He would die from joy if this happened. It would be a dream come true.

I realize it is horrible quality, but I don't need it to be perfect, just a tad better.

If it helps, he is definitely bald.

My name is Mike McCutchen and I've been digging away at a passion project for about two years now, a feature length no budget hyper stylized action film (A Scanner Darkly meets Scott Pilgrim meets Ang Lee's Hulk). It's not been easy at all, scraping money together to build sets/feed folks/etc... but I'm finally in post!

I'm looking for two different things with this post:

ONE: A person/s who loves comic books and is familiar with ""sound effects"" in text form. ""Bam!"" or ""Krak!"" or ""Crunch!"" and would like to come on board to help create a decent amount of them to be composited into the film itself. 

TWO: Anyone interested in basic sky replacement. I'd ideally like to give you a frame where you would then add buildings into the background where there was an empty sky (I have plenty of building images). I would then track the footage and composite them into the film myself. 

Also, any artists/illustrators who might be interested in the project as well.

This is a no budget project, so I can't pay you any kind of standard rate. I can and will pay you something, give you the credit you deserve, and promise you your work will be seen. I'm truly not looking to swindle anyone or sleaze anyone over. I just need the help.

I'm not looking to unload all of my VFX onto other folks, since I'm doing pretty much all of them myself, but these two things would significantly help me get the film done. Feel free to IMDB me or check out anything I've written on the movie news site ""Ain't It Cool News"" where I write as ""Muldoon."" I love movies. This is a cool one. I just need help and I'm willing to pay.

Feel free to email me: mikemccutchen@gmail.com

Thanks for your time!

You guys and gals are incredible. Thank you all so much - this sincerely means a ton to me, and will to my family. It's really strange, I don't know if you've experienced this or not, but having seen a picture in sepia/BW for so long, and it suddenly becomes color - the moment in time becomes so much more real, so much more ""it really happened."" Adding the puffy clouds definitely gives it a heavenly quality, which is perfect. Deeply moved.

I'm going home for winter break in about a week and I don't have any work waiting for me there, so I thought I'd try and generate some stuff to do other than just spending my time moping and sitting around doing nothing.

Here's the deal: I'm willing to take on as many contracts as I can finish in one month, starting next Friday. I'll complete the projects in the order that they are received. All I ask is that

1) The projects are SFW

2) You are ok with me using it in my portfolio

3) If you like what I do, and it is within your power, send me some referrals!

Each project, no matter how big or small, costs 2 cents paid upon completion.

Here's what I need from you: Comment or PM me what you need done and any specifics (colors/text/themes/etc.) that you want me to work with, along with an email where I can reach you. Once I've finished the project, I'll send you the final result and my paypal information.

Thanks, and hit me with your best shot, reddit!

If there's stuff next to your request in parentheses, that means I need something more before I can start work on your project.

I really like my girlfriend and i want to please her with a special gift. She is really into cute little animals : fox, squirrels, cats...

We also have to decorate our new flat ;)

So i want you draw something for her, and i want to have something detailed, beautiful and big enough to be framed, that's why i think it's normal to pay good money for it.

Precisely, i imagine a scene in the forest, there is a lot of light, beautiful sky, many colorful flowers and trees, butterflies, birds, everything is cheerful, joyful. The main characters are 3 animals, running together. I imagine a little squirrel with motorcycle glasses riding a fox, they race a cat. They are all having a lot of fun, everything is happiness, they are playing together, they are friends. 

you are free to do it however you want, to be as creative as you want, as long as you respect the whole nature-love-friendship-happiness idea. squirrels and fox are important.

about the format, i just want to be able to print it and frame it. I don't care if it is public , you can release it publicly.  the only thing i ask, if you draw it on paper (and not on computer), i may want to obtain the original. I will pay for the shipment.

If this request is not relevant here, tell me which website/subreddit i should go ?

thank you a lot !!!!

edit : my girlfriend will be to vietnam during the whole july month. I would like to have the drawing when she comes back, 1 august.

I am getting married on July 28th, 2013. The idea we have at the beginning of our ceremony is to have a little tribute to my mom and my fiance's mother. Unfortunately they had passed away before our wedding day (mine in 2011 hers in 2003). 

Our idea is to have our mother's pictures in a frame in the first two seats in the front then place a rose in front of them before the wedding ceremony starts. The issue is that her mother's picture is just her mother in the frame, but my mother has my dad along with his best man hanging out in the background.

Im hoping someone with the skills could spell it out with realistic looking stars. My plan would be to get it printed on transparent paper/plastic and put on the end of the telescope (glass removed.) The diameter of the lens is 2.5 inches. So that would be the ideal size.

[SKETCH](http://i.imgur.com/OfhbS.jpg)

The final label needs to be in a 4:3 ratio rectangle.


Pertinent info:

- The overall feel I was going for was ""rustic"" or ""old-timey"".

- Font can be different, but close would be great.

- The that's a tap handle in the bite on the apple, and the ""xxx"" is meant to denote that it's alcohol. Obviously that can be changed if you have another idea for a picture on the label.

- The quote, ""Don't call it f*ckin' cider!!"" is an inside joke, and needs to be on the label as a catchphrase.

- The blacked out bar on the right was due to a formatting issue, and isn't a part of the design.

Essentially, use a large nebula image and match the font. Some vector graphics format? Or large enough image file so it prints clearly across ~20-30 inches

* It needs to fit the current dimensions (299 x 353 [Here is a direct link to the current sidebar image.](http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/mk_Y4fxjwo68-tM2.jpg))
* It needs to be SFW

You have until September 29 to get something made. 

I would love it if we could get enough to change the sidebar every few days in October!

If this goes well, we will make this a thing that happens on a regular basis.

So, show me what you've got!

It's one of her favorite pictures of herself, and it turns out I had the only copy. I think the quality is reduced on this imgur link. So if anyone thinks they can help, please PM me and I'll email the high quality pic directly to you.

Of all the people she could have chose to send this to, she chose me. That made me feel really special, so I want to give her the best response ever! She’s super shy and only recently started to come out of her shell. But she’s just an amazing and super special little girl with a sweet and loving heart.

I’m asking anyone anywhere to take Shadow on a mini adventure in their locality or around the world.

This can be accomplished by any means at your disposal but it’d be really cool if you could actually print Shadow out and take a genuine photo at some landmark nearby but this isn’t required. Feel free to use any software to get the perfect shot of Shadow at your favorite place in the world if that’s what you’d prefer to do. I’ll accept any help you’re willing to offer.

Also, since I’m only half decent at creative writing, if anyone would like to take a stab at a crazy or silly story for how Shadow’s trip around the world went, I’ll make sure the photos match.

Here is an album of [5 pics](http://imgur.com/a/jOgrV#2WOgY) of the perpetrator.

$20 prize to the most upvoted funny shop.  Downvotes won't count.  Contest runs until Thursday May 5th.  Prize will be paid via paypal or to a charity of your choice.

The perpetrator hates the toronto maple leafs while loving the buffalo sabers.  She considers herself as a good dancer and golfer while being challenged in both.  She loves brad paisley (country guy) and had crush on joey from new kids on the block as a teenager.

She is very sweet and her dream was to always run an animal adoption agency.  It's called The Way Home, Inc.  She started last October and already has done more than 50 adoptions.  Her and the other fosters currently have 70+ cats for adoption, most are less than a year old.  I love the organization so I took over social media and marketing since that's what I study in school.  I've tripled the likes on FB and went out to local places passing out flyers.  I want a new logo because the one I made isn't that great, but this is what I was able to do for her.  Please help out, I don't have anything to give away, but just know how much it would mean to her and everyone else at The Way Home.  Plus I could hook you up with a sweet deal on a kitten if you live in Orlando!
This is the logo I made.  Vickie (the owner) said she wants the logo to have something to do with a cat going home, but anything is better than what I came up with.

Today he has pancreatic cancer and a few weeks (at the most) to live.  I'd like to get this picture cleaned up if possible to include in a slideshow for him and for his memorial service.  It's a picture of him, his daughter (my mom), and my dad but it's blurry and the lighting is awful - it's a total mess.
