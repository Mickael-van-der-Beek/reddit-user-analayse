This is the way the world ends

Not with a bang but a whimper.

-The Hollow Men (1925) T.S. Eliot

The poet T. S. Eliot had his own prophetic ideas about how the world might end but scientists have recently seriously speculated on what kind of events could wipe mankind from the universe. Of course an untreatable epidemic is usually mentioned along with encounters with a rogue black hole or an asteroid like the one that killed all the dinosaurs. But one interesting and unusual scenario that results in the destruction of all of mankind is the Hal Scenario in which machines of our own creation take over the world and destroy us all. Could Eliot’s Hollow Men be machines?

Could this really happen? Well personally I think it COULD happen and I think we need to look more carefully at what is being done with our machines of the mind today while we still have some control.

We may have had a taste of the Hal Scenario as recently as May 6, 2010. On May 6, 2010 the machines were, for a few terrifying minutes, in charge of the largest economy on earth.

On May 6, 2010 the financial world saw the entire US equity market collapse, and recover, in about 20 minutes. Never in the history of US markets had price dropped so low and so fast. On May 6, the day of flash and crash, more than 19 billion shares were traded across multiple markets and investors lost billions.

This is what it looked like on a chart:

        http://short-term-stocktrading.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/FlashCrash21.jpg                                  
Traders were numbed by the pace of selling and many froze like deer caught in the headlights of an oncoming truck. 

At 2:20 p.m. EDT the Dow was down 400 points.

This was bad, but then the DOW fell another 600 points in just seven minutes, the fastest and largest drop in the stock markets history. 

One stock, Accenture, fell from $42.17 to 4 cents. 

But the overall market did not stay down long and by 3:09 p.m., the Dow had regained 700 points. Prices continued to fluctuate wildly until the markets mercifully closed.

After the close traders walked around in a daze, with vacant looks in their eyes, not unlike soldiers who had just been beaten by a vastly superior and unseen enemy.

“I think the machines just took over. There’s not a lot of human interaction,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “We’ve known that automated trading can run away from you, and I think that’s what we saw happen today.”

Was the flash crash a precursor to the Hal Scenario?

Initially the flash crash attracted some attention and President Obama commented briefly on the largest stock market drop in history.

But then the whole event seemed to disappear from the public consciousness. Newspapers stopped running stories about it and nearly two months after the event the many government investigations have failed to explain what really happened. The government went hush hush and basically covered the whole thing up.

But there have been some interesting ideas floating around on the Internet: 

Machines can mimic human thought processes AND emotions through a process dubbed by some as Androgenic Syntactic Analysis or ASA. ASA allows for a smooth conversion between the ways humans think and communicate into binary code which is the way machines and computers think and communicate. 

Using androgenic syntactic analysis the most sophisticated aspects of human intelligence are converted into usable machine language where it can be parsed at lightening speed, networked and compounded. Its like taking 100 of Einsteins brains, networking them, and then having them capable of outputting a life time of Einsteins ideas in a millisecond said an unidentified source alleged to be close to the government investigations.

IF it were true it might suggest that the events of May 6, 2010 were a precursor of the Hal Scenario and that for a few terrifying minutes the machines had total control over the American economy. Furthermore the machines might have thought about and knew what they were doing.

Or perhaps it was just a mistake made by the programmers of these machines, a case of the research animals briefly escaping from their cages and raising a little hell.

I have argued that machines can understand Wall Street whereas the human mind cannot. Furthermore I have suggested that traders should not try to make subjective stock trading decisions, but should let their computers do the thinking for them.

We traded through the flash and crash with our computers running hot and we emerged more or less unscathed. But perhaps we were just lucky.

But regardless of whether or not you buy into the possibility of the Hal Scenario I think it is clear that thinking machines are alive and well on Wall Street and these thinking machines can and will at times take over our markets. 

If the machines can take over our markets they can take over us.

And if robots are running Wall Street you are going to need a robot for a friend if you want to make money!

I've structured it as a text-only narrative, with just a few canonical guidelines, meant to be expanded and improved upon by interested redditors.

Please [take a look](http://www.reddit.com/r/I_am_the_last_one/) and decide for yourself whether you wish to participate.  My hope is that this spins completely out of my control, while heeding these basic rules:

* A catastrophic outbreak has quickly killed 99.9% of the human race
* Animals seem unaffected, and electricity and internet are mysteriously still operational
* Shadowy organized forces, whether military or otherwise, appear to exist - their intentions are unclear
* There may be hidden survivors' networks, or some kind of underground resistance

I have numbered my own posts, to provide a chronology.  This approach won't work with other contributors, however.  Perhaps we can date our posts in the title.  Let me know what you think about this, to help provide some kind of flow to the larger storyline.

In the end, I'm hoping you can all join me in making this a complex, scary, richly detailed narrative.  Be creative.  Make your submissions as terrifying, gory, thrilling or poignant as you wish.  If it takes off, maybe we can start weaving in similar themes and rules to really make it all feel like a single, realistic series of events.

This was what was left of America. A desert of endless desolation, with small settlements scattered around the wasteland. When the plague had infected a significant portion of the population, America’s allies turned on us for their own safety. They launched nukes, bombed us, anything to destroy the infected and keep the plague from their borders. No one knows if it worked. Survivors don’t really get around internationally anymore.

The sun was unforgiving, beating down like an invisible fire, smothering everything in heat. I pulled my tinted goggles from my jacket pocket and put them on. The glare wasn’t as bad but still almost blinding. The smoke had long since faded from view; I was just walking in the same direction as before. I was aware that I had attracted a few followers; I heard the footsteps of several walkers shuffling behind me, eager for their next meal. I took another swig from my canteen and walked on.

~

I had been walking for several hours. The sun was beginning its descent down the western sky. It was still fairly bright, but soon I would need to find shelter. I walked on. The ground seemed to drop off ahead of me, I amounted it to a mirage. Then I slid down a massive crater in the middle of desert. The heat was intense, sizzling where my arm touched. I struggled to regain my footing and climb out. The walkers behind me had fallen in several at a time, making a sound like sizzling meat. I was able to get out and collapse on the ground. I looked back; I had fallen into a massive glass crater. These things were everywhere, scars of china launching thermite missiles at us. The walkers that had fallen in were sliding to the center, leaving a trail of blood and burned flesh. 

My adrenaline wore off and I felt excruciating pain in my arm. I sat up, inspecting my own burn from the crater. A portion of the flesh on my arm had simply burned away, revealing the tissue underneath. It was bleeding fairly badly. I pulled bandages and alcohol from my pack. I gingerly poured alcohol onto the burn, cringing in pain. I began wrapping the bandage around it, blood seeping through. I dry swallowed a couple of painkillers and got to my feet. I looked one last time at the crater; the walkers had reached the center, now almost totally skinless, and were slipping and sliding in their own blood. I turned to the west, seeing the smoke again, and walked on.

~

After another hour or so of walking I saw a small shack in the distance as darkness was beginning to fall. It may be a mirage, it may be real. Either way I needed shelter from the hordes that emerged at night. I jogged towards it, closing the distance in minutes.

I made it inside the shack, watching for any threat inside. The shack itself was in a horrible state, destined to collapse at any time. I closed the door, bolting it with a small piece of rotten wood. I looked around; the shack was too open. Anything could get in at anytime. I heard the shuffling of hundreds of walkers approaching, their feet kicking up a massive dust cloud outside. I frantically searched around, looking for any escape. My fingers found purchase on the ground; a small trapdoor hidden by a layer of sand over it. I pulled it open and dropped inside, immediately greeted by darkness.

I used a small piece of wood I found above with one of my remaining matches to make a crude torch. Luckily, the basement area wasn’t too large. Light greeted every corner of the room. I made a small fire in the center of the room and took a better look around the room. There was an old shelf in the corner, stacked with a few canned goods. Next to the shelf was an old skeleton with a hole in its skull, an old revolver still in its hand. I went for the cans, filling my pack and deciding to feast on the canned soup tonight. I took my pocketknife to the can, stabbing a hole into the top. I brought the hole to my mouth, drinking greedily. I savored every drop, committing the flavor to memory.

When I was finished I began setting up my sleeping area, laying my sleeping bag near the fire. Dust fluttered down from the roof of this basement; the herd was passing. I could faintly hear their moans, always hungry. I settled into my sleeping bag, wrapping myself in warmth. The fire crackled, heat slapping my face. I reached for my pack to check my water. Nearly empty. I sighed, I would have to find more tomorrow. I curled into myself, absorbing as much heat as I could, and settled into sleep.

~

I still remember the first time I killed a walker. I had still had a car then, with enough gas to get me out of the state. I was stopped by a massive traffic jam, burned out cars and corpses everywhere. I saw a man kneeling by a bloodied woman, like he was crying. I left the safety of my vehicle to see if he was alright.

Once I was closer I was hit by a horrendous smell, like rotten eggs mixed with homelessness. I saw that the man wasn’t mourning the woman, he was feasting on her. Each bite tearing new flesh and blood from the body. I clutched my stomach, feeling woozy. The man suddenly stood, turning my way and sniffing the air. I panicked and ran back to my car, but newly infected are faster than others as I learned that day.

 He was on me before I could reach my door. He pulled me to the ground, snapping his jaws at me. I struggled to escape his vice-like grasp on me. I looked around for anything I could use. My hands found purchase on a small, but heavy, brick in the road. I grabbed it and swung with all my might at the creature’s head. I hit harder than I thought possible, opening a hole in his head. He went limp immediately. Black blood poured from the wound onto the pavement. 

I struggled to me feet, and started vomiting, wrenching at what I had done. Tears sprang from my eyes, falling like a light rain. I turned to go back to my car and looked back one last time at my handiwork. I felt sick inside, but strangely proud.

This one moment started the change in me.

I woke to a rumbling outside the house. I silently slid from the bed onto the floor. I peeked over the window, searching for the source of the rumbling. It was a truck with two masked men yelling at each other. From the looks of it they were armed with only crowbars. I reached into my pack, fumbling for the only firearm I possessed. I pulled the sleek pistol from my pack. I checked the clip, only five bullets. Better safe than sorry. 
I opened the door. The men would take at least a minute or two to enter the house. I decided against wasting time setting traps and just took cover on the upstairs balcony, looking down at the front door. The men were approaching. They entered the door, tripping my wires and knocking the cans of glass.

“WHAT THE FUCK?!” one man shouted. He caught his friend’s attention and he jogged inside with the first man.

“What are you going on about?” man number two asked. 
“I walked in and busted these cans full of glass!” he was getting angry at his dim witted companion. He must have been the leader of the two. “so?” The leader’s friend was scratching his head stupidly. “So, we ain’t alone here! Look around and find the little bastard, we need the supplies!” They split up and started ransacking the first floor. They were loud, rambunctiously announcing where they were and what they were doing with a pointless amount of yelling. 

Easy prey.

I crept down the stairs, careful not to disturb anything that could give me away. I peeked around the hall into what looked like a dining room. The leader’s friend was tearing through the cabinets looking for anything of value. I stealthily slipped behind him, raising my hatchet. He continued searching, not noticing me within a foot of his back. I chopped into his neck, burying the weapon in the flesh. He was halfway decapitated, choking and gurgling on his own blood before dying. Unfortunately he was a heavier than I expected. I tried to catch his body before he hit the ground, but I crumpled under the weight. We fell with a thud that echoed throughout the silent house.

“What was that?!” I heard running steps from the hall. I hastily jumped behind the counter so he wouldn’t see me. I heard the steps stop, and start again, slower. “So you killed him huh? I would have sooner or later, so thank you. But there’s only one way out of this house, and you won’t get the chance to use it.” The man acted like he was in control of the situation, like he knew he would get through this. I would prove him wrong.
I poked my head over my cover, seeing the man search his dead friend. He took the crowbar his friend had dropped, now wielding two crowbars like a crazed mutant. He went towards my cover, striding towards me menacingly. There was no way he had seen me. How could know where I was? He got closer, close enough that I could smell his rancid breath. 

The hell with the silent approach.

I leaped over my cover, flailing my hatchet like a madman. He adopted my style of flailing limbs, but his crowbars gave him a distinct advantage. I took a blow to the ribs, feeling a feeling one crack. I tried to block his next attack, but I only succeeded in knocking my hatchet onto the floor. He dropkicked me, I landed on my back. He put his boot on my chest and squatted down to my level. “I told you you wouldn’t get out of here alive little man.” He smiled, showing jagged shards of teeth like broken glass.

Broken glass.

I had to keep him occupied from smashing my skull in. “So that guy over there was your friend” I asked, gesturing towards the body.  “Really scraping the bottom of the barrel huh?” He laughed like a jolly fat man with extra rations for the day. Then he smiled again, showing those horrific teeth. “So telling jokes at your last moments eh? I can respect that, but why?” I shrugged. “I have another one before I die. What’s leaking blood and won’t help you in the least?” his smile faded. Mine broadened.

“Your eyes!”

He hadnt noticed that with my free hand I had scooped a huge handful of broken glass from the floor while he was laughing. Now I threw it straight into his eyes. He recoiled, clawing at his bleeding eyes, wailing like a child. I took this opporotunity to take on of his crowbars and slam it into the side of his knee. The bone broke skin, blood spurting onto the floor. I did the same to the other leg. He fell to his knees, looking up at me, pleading silently for a show of mercy. I contemplated his fate, he wouldn’t get far with broken legs. Why waste the energy ending his meaningless life? I couldn’t take any chances.

I cracked the crowbar across his face, knocking his jaw out of place. Blood poured from his mouth, broken teeth flowing in the waterfall of red. Then I kicked him onto his back and beat his head until nothing was left but a bloody mess of bone and brain.
 
I searched the bodies, Finding nothing of value but an expensive looking watch. I went back to the room I slept in and retrieved my backpack, then walked to the car the left outside and checked the inside. They had run out of gas. I checked the glove box, and found a pistol holster. I strapped it to my side and gave my pistol a new home besides my backpack.
 
I pulled my binoculars from my backpack, scanning the desert horizon. I saw a few walkers and focused on the thin wisps of black smoke on the horizon. I put my binoculars away and grimaced. This would be a long walk. I reached back into my pack, grabbing my canteen, and took a swig of water.

Then I started walking.

Unfortunately progress is often stalled by profit.

Maybe 'disclosure of things hidden' means the world is held back, in the harnesses of commercialism.

	Back in December, when the apocalypse happened, I was still just a 13 year old girl who cared about just her computer and her Minecraft account, sitting in the dark for six hours a day, staring at a screen when I should've been training and hunting, making sure I was ready for the apocalypse that wasn't supposed to happen, that the scientists said the Mayans just made up. But December 21st came, we figured out that it was all too real and we were all going to die.
	I live on my own now. My family and friends are dead. Gone. I'm all alone. I don't miss them anymore. I think it's better to travel alone then in groups. Groups slow you down. Groups kill you. I've seen it all before. Right now I'm travelling across the country to California, where there supposedly is food and water, and maybe even shelter. People, too. The Mississippi was destroyed when an enormous sinkhole opened up right in front of the lake that fed it around Christmas day, while everyone was still in mass panic. It now pours into a huge cave system that we never knew existed, instead of trickling down into the Gulf. 
	Right now, I'm sitting in the ruins of an abandoned apartment building, on the third floor, in Missouri, in a little kids former bedroom, with ripped up stuffed animals sitting near a box spring, where someone had stolen the mattress, thinking they could use it to survive, long ago. There's some heat left from the fire that I built on the fire escape, and I'm writing by the light of it's dying flame. It's late August, and it's already kind of cold. You can tell there's a storm coming when it gets cold here. The clouds seem to gather around the very edges of your vision.
	Whenever I think about my family, I cringe. I converted to cannibalism long ago, but it still makes me feel awful when I think about my origins. I was so hungry, and they looked so... delicious. They tried to resist. I just stabbed harder, laughing from insanity, hunger, and just plain joy of not feeling so.. Restricted, like killing was a part of your nature, that you just couldn't help, but was frowned upon . I became a chef of horrific proportions, boiling bone marrow and eating organs for dessert, sometimes even drying the skin to make some form of flesh jerky, you might say. And I'm only 14 years old.
	Today is my birthday. I celebrated by having liver for cake. The poor girl that it came from didn't even resist me. She was too small, covered in dirt, crying, just sitting there while I slit her throat. I didn't want to make her suffer like I did the people that tried to kill me, so I made it quick. I felt awful, for the first time in a while. I sucked some marrow out of a femur for a finishing course. It was delicious. 
	Sometimes, I think about how sick I am to be able to do this. But then I realize that this is what everyone has to do now. This is what we do to survive. It's how I stay alive. It's why I'm not laying in a ditch, just a corpse for someone to eat. For someone else to survive off of.
	I sleep under the stars during the summer. When it gets cold I'll use the blanket I made by sewing layers of human skins together. The idea came to me in a spur of the moment thought, around January, while I was cold, so cold. The few people I saw had coats, and I hated them for it. I would kill whoever had a coat, so I could wear it and keep warm. But the coats started to fray. They don't just keep factories going after the apocalypse happens. Eventually, there were less and less people with shirts, then shoes. The coats didn't exist anymore. People wore deer skins. Then the deer were gone, overhunted, dead from the apocalyptic natural disasters that had befell them. Then, one day, in the dead of winter, it came to me. All these people I ate... They all had skin.. Skin, it was the only thing that I could use to keep warm. Like wearing someone else’s body. I hacked it away from the muscle at first, making a crude hide, then carefully would tear off the meat and scrape it off with my knife I found on a girl not much older than me, a few weeks dead. Eventually, I made enough that I decided to sew them together. When I did, I made sure that it wasn't going to tear, so I used twine, instead of thread.  I don't skin them anymore. It's not my favorite thing to do. It's sick, but keeps the heat in. I don't care anymore. Now, since I tanned it, it doesn't smell of corpses.
	One time, someone stabbed me in the leg with a knife while I wasn't looking, back in December. I immediately tore the knife out of my leg and ran after them, and stabbed them in the throat, while I sat on top of them so they couldn't get away. It was the longest, most painful death I could think of at the moment. It made me feel so... happy. I realized that everyone has someone who is capable of torture and death inside, no matter who you are.
	That night I had flesh for dinner. I feel sick every time I eat it, even now.
	I look up at the sky on clear nights and wonder about who I've become. Am I a cannibal? Am I horrible? Have I done unforgivable things? Yes. I sit there and repeat to myself, ""You're not horrible. You're surviving."" Over and over and over again until I fall asleep, under a blanket made from guilt and shame.

1340069307.0,9,self.Apocalypse,v95hw,Top ways the world could end?,TacoSalad33,15,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/v95hw/top_ways_the_world_could_end/,"*Dear r/Apocalypse;* There is a lot of talk going on about the end of the world as we know it and as a result we are all getting a bit paranoid or are we? I see that the zombie apocalypse has become a popular ""what if"" these days and I started thinking about other farfetched possibilities that exist. Well I did some research and came up with a list but it is up to you to decide which is the most likely to happen.

*When contemplating this;* Keep in mind that we don't know as much as we think we do and for that reason anything could be possible. Today we implement our imagination in science fiction as well as many other outlets and unknowingly predict the future of civilization and technology. If not for this fact our species might not have come this far. With that stated, in this page I will list the VODs aka ""visions of disorder"" that have been thought of by the imagination of our species that could potentially come true despite how unrealistic they may seem.

**So far our species have imagined the VODs listed below in alphabetical order.** 

*A current total of (19)*

Videos have been linked to the beginning of each VOD for examples. Enjoy! :)

[Alien Invasion;] (http://youtu.be/cg0YsGfCq7o) A invasive extraterrestrial species has discovered us and wants to meat our leader for dinner. *Will we resist?*

[Dinopocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/ZEQoRHrmPVc) Anything can and could go tremendously wrong and for whatever reason a large number of thought to be extinct dinosaurs could resurface and they might wake up terribly hungry one day. It could be anything between a carnivorous beetle that would swarm once excavated or graboids that resurface every 100k years to feast. *Will we stop the invasive dinosaurs?*

[Econopocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/9n29c-q3_8Q) World trade has died as markets crash and banks bail out. All bank accounts across the world have froze and the economy has come to a complete stop as the price of bread has increased over ten thousand dollars. The people are suffering and with no electricity or plumbing they are living in pestilence as well as famine and death. War is the last thing society needs at this point. *Will we rebuild?* [sharprock] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/v95hw/top_ways_the_world_could_end/c52eqxd)

[Global Warming;] (http://youtu.be/oEp382HIisE) The Earth is gradually getting hotter as we begin to lead our lives in a living hell for ignoring the signs. The ice caps have completely melted as regions along every coast have been flooded. Leaving little to no land for life to live on. *Will we continue to deny it?*

[Ice Age II;] (http://youtu.be/FuI5ZtE3lOI) It is possible for our planet to experience another if not worse ice age than last. In the closure of global nuclear war, mass Earth quakes and even terrorism, through the detonation of ICBMs and or the destruction or damage to power plants in any event can result in nuclear winter which will result in a second Ice Age. Mistakes can be made while exceeding efforts to thwart global warming that can cause it. Even a super volcanic eruption or asteroid strike would do it. The odds of us experiencing a second Ice Age are not that farfetched and it remains a possible threat to our existence today. *Will we build igloos?*

[Lunapocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/4AmVocfKvPw) Man on the Moon has been tampering with it's surface too much and it has been ruined. As pieces of our moon drift off into space and our tides slow. We all began to feel the stress of a lack of food as the Earth becomes desolate and lifeless in most regions. *Will we wane or wax?*

[Meteor Strike;] (http://youtu.be/GmKWYPWTo9o) The next Asteroid that finds a nice target on our planet may be the last one we ever witness. *Will the bunkers be deep enough?*

[Millennial Storm;] (http://youtu.be/AHGveHs0HPM) In a desperate attempt to thwart global warming we make a mistake by sealing off the Bering Strait and cause a series of ecological events leading to the perfect storm capable of erasing all of human creation. The Millennial Storm would sweep people off their feet. *Will we require diving gear?* *Inspired by:* [Popular Science Magazine July 2012 Issue] (http://www.popsci.com/)

[Monsterpocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/S1NK6zOtg8M) Through experimentation or tampering of nature something didn't go as planned. Now the world is teeming with unforeseen creatures that are causing problems for everyone. Maybe we brought them here. Maybe the E.T.'s did. Perhaps they live in space and migrate through our system every 100k years. Who knows, but if they came we would certainly have a hard time. *Will we be eaten alive?* *Inspired by:* [Monsterpocalypse The Game] (http://monsterpocalypse.com/)

[Mutant Uprising;] (http://youtu.be/C1SfwPPbkVI) Something has gone wrong in science or maybe we're evolving. The people are mutating and a divide has formed between the people of Earth. *Will we coexist?*

[Oil Crisis;] (http://youtu.be/9n29c-q3_8Q) The peak in oil production has been met and the reserves are low. With barely any fuel to take us to space let alone power the world, the lights begin to go out for the Human species ever so slowly. *Will we commit to green technology?* [sharprock] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/v95hw/top_ways_the_world_could_end/c52n2vn)

[Pole Shift;] (http://youtu.be/FE3yIUsduf4) The Earth's poles suddenly shift a great deal and it's crust trembles heavily through out the world as we all fall through the cracks in a series of super Earth quakes. *Will we hold on?*

[Robopocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/-G3RoBHMu-o) Mankind has dabbled with technology and AI enough to make the forewarned mistake of giving it a body and control over most if not all technology in the world. *Will they bite the hand that feeds?*

[Solar Flare;] (http://youtu.be/crtWfbdGz-4) The Sun and all it's glory has finally produced the solar flare of the millennium and has wiped out all electronics on the globe. Unprepared and dependent on power, all of society comes to a stand still. Riots erupt as the people of Earth struggle to cope. The radiation around the planet is so strong we might not be able to use electricity for years. *Will we survive with out power?*

[Super Volcano;] (http://youtu.be/7as7Ej_U6yU) The worlds largest and oldest super volcano suddenly becomes active again and gives the Earth a good shaking before purging us all into an ice age. *Will we enjoy fire and ice?*

[Unknown Astronomical Anomaly;] (http://youtu.be/QlGZavEO58g) In the event that a unforeseen astronomical anomaly develops on or near our solar system we are all pretty much screwed! It could be anything really. So lets hope we know as much about space as we think we do or else we could all be sitting ducks waiting for something to erase our existence. *Will we let this happen?*

[Viral Outbreak;] (http://youtu.be/4sYSyuuLk5g) Zombies aside, let us not forget the threat of viral outbreaks in general. All it takes is a new mutagen for us all to start bleeding from our eyes. One day breaking news will headline the most terrifying news of all. *Will our immune system hold up?*

[WWIII: Global War;] (http://youtu.be/NHWjlCaIrQo) A dramatic situation occurs and Nuclear weapons have been launched. Our homeland among many others have been destroyed. *Will we survive all out war?*

[Zombipocalypse;] (http://youtu.be/NVYP46ecl4Y) The more popular of all the scenarios. A viral outbreak creates a siege of the undead consuming the living. Humanity begins to destroy itself in the most horrific way possible. *Will we survive the horror?*

[This is the end for now;] (http://youtu.be/Z0GFRcFm-aY) If you feel I missed anything feel free to add them in a comment and I will update the list as we continue the discussion. All ""Apocalyptic"" scenarios are welcome so long as it implies a dramatic change in human life and or possible extinction. It also must be a known product of fiction or non-fiction.

I stopped at the farmhouse, or what was left of it. Most of the windows had been shattered, an entire wall was missing, and the front door was splintered through the entry. I sighed. There probably wasn’t anything worth looting inside, but the sun was beginning its descent below the horizon. The house would have to do. I stepped through the doorway, watching for any movement. I set my backpack on the ground and brought out my tripwires. I lay several discreetly across the doorframe and attached them to a set of tin cans filled with broken glass. Any intruders wouldn’t get inside without making a tremendous amount of noise. 

Something shattered upstairs. I was alert in an instant. It could be anything up there. I pulled my pack around the corner to a small opening in the wall. I took my hatchet from the sheathe, the blade unforgiving as the night. I made my way up the stairs, careful not to make the steps creak beneath my feet.
Footsteps. I froze. A body shuffled past the stairs, a bloody stump where its left foot should have been. It stopped, sniffed, and turned in my direction. This used to be a man. With a job, paid his taxes, probably had a girlfriend. Now just another body. While I thought of his past, he fell on me. We tumbled down the stairs, grappling. We hit the bottom; I struggled to clear the stars from my eyes. The thing strained to bring its decayed teeth to my arm, at which point I kicked out, snapping its leg. It fell to the side, then I brought my hatchet down on the thing’s snarling face until it stopped twitching. Brains leaked from its shattered skull.

I searched the body. Cigarettes. That would fetch a decent price at Container Town. I grabbed my pack and headed back upstairs. I turned into the bedroom and shut the door behind me. A body lay on the floor, long dead but had been gnawed on recently. Perhaps this was what the walker was so interested in? It didn’t matter. They were both dead now. Or deader. I sat on the bed, opening a can of beans long past the expiration date. The beans were tasteless and depressing but it felt good to have something in my stomach. I discarded the can and lay on the bed. The sun had set and darkness enveloped the room. The dead were roaming in great numbers tonight. I heard the distant screams of another soul added to their ranks.
Just another day in hell. 

~

My name is Marcus Jones. The world ended on May seventeenth of two-thousand and eleven around two-thirty PM. I was working at my office, the most boring job in the world. The steady tap-tap-tap-tap of the fifty keyboards in the room being furiously typed was drowning out the sound of my own thoughts. The radio was blaring some tune by The Beatles but I wasn’t paying attention. I had a finance report due by the end of the work day and still had a black document on my screen.

The suddenly all the keyboards stopped. I curiously peered over my cubicle and everyone had moved to the television in the lounge. I stood up and walked to the throng of my coworkers, slipping to the front of the group. The president was wearing a gas mask, muffling his speaking. Under the glass faceplate of the mask he looked pale, sickly. His eyes looked panicked, erratic. The secret service had weapons drawn surrounding him in a semi-circle. I then noticed a tear in his suit that cost more than my apartment. The tear was bloodstained and the flesh underneath was almost black, pulsing with what looked like an infection of some sort. 

He was apologizing on live television, that alone meant this was something serious. The president said he thought they could control it, that they could weaponize it. He leaned on the podium for support, seemingly struggling to remain conscious. He suddenly went into a fit of coughing, shaking violently, before standing more slouched than before. He took the mask off, revealing bloodshot eyes and foam frothing at his mouth. He looked ravenous now. He looked to the nearest secret serviceman with a crazed hunger in his eyes. 

My coworkers and I were beginning to realize this wasn’t a joke. Then the screaming started. The president had sunk his teeth into the secret serviceman’s throat. Blood spurted the camera, adding a red blur to the scene. The president tore through the crowd, they didn’t stand a chance. The camera had fallen, giving us a view of a man with his throat torn open by his leader’s teeth. Most of my coworkers had left in a panic, their screeching tires being the only farewell they gave. The more strong willed of us continued watching, struggling to keep our lunches inside us. The body on screen began stitching, and stood up. It shuffled over the camera, cutting our live feed to a mess of static. I ran from the lounge, across the lobby, out the door towards my car. I started the car and sped out of the parking lot. Panic had already spread through my small town, I passed people begging for rides, having already seen the same news feed I did. They pleaded, banging my windows, throwing stones, even hurling themselves at my car. I kept driving. 

I finally reached my apartment. I ran inside, searching for my survival kit I kept packed for emergencies. I tore my room apart, grabbing my lucky hatchet along with the sheath. I finally found my survival kit, pre-packed with all the essentials. The house now held nothing of value. I went back to my car and drove away. I didn’t know where I was going, just away. Away from all of this madness. Away from everything. 

I will survive this. By any means necessary.

The ever increasing probability, duration, depth, and complexity of disaster when technology fails us.

  This has been a problem that has been growing in my mind for a few years now. Humans as a species thrive through our ability to manipulate the environment around us, coupled with the ability to create and use technology to that end.  However, it is this technology that causes us the greatest threat to our continued survival.  We live in such a wonderful and amazing world today, a world that has a infinitely different number of technologies for every one of our creature comforts.  Each based upon improving current levels of comfort, efficiency, and ease of use.  it is this last one that is perhaps the root of all future issues. 

 The fact that we as a culture expect everyone to utilize the most current form  of technology, and thus teach the younger generations how to use them, it is seamless.  This is the problem, with each generation born into this ever increasingly complex world of computers and cell phones and microchips, they don't need to know HOW this technology works. Nor do they learn how the previous levels of technology worked.  I suppose we are lucky in this sense, starting right after the first world war, we began handing out technology to the masses, and for the first time the user didn't need to know how it worked or why it didn't.  Before then if the operator of say a steam engine, which by today's standards is an extremely simple machine, did not know why it worked the way it did, then he or she would in all probability be killed or seriously maimed by it.

  The majority of all technologies employed by the populace, at least in this country, and those that have the respect of being called ""developed,"" rely on one singular power source... ELECTRICITY.  There are several issues that could arise within the use of this power source. All of them, high voltage transmission wires, power stations, the availability of fuel sources, are extremely sensitive, and extremely inefficient.  In our all consuming effort to produce more power we destroy the environment around us. This environment isn't just the woodlands, or meadows or the oceans, it is also the ozone layer above us, the one protective layer we have against the dangers of cosmic rays and solar storms.  The irony is that, as we plunder our natural world looking to power or technologies, we put ourselves at greater threat of that technologies failing, not just for now, not just for tomorrow but forever. This  is what will happen in the future, not if. an example of if: we go to war with any nuclear equipped nation, a nationwide e.m.p. (electro-magnetic pulse) would wipe all our precious technologies out, and the grid.

  So here lies the biggest issue, now that we don't have electricity, or any of the technologies it powers, what now?  Yes, there are those of us that could salvage what we have left to make do. Do you know how to forge steal? Do you know how to build the tools necessary to do so?  What about feeding the populace? Most people take for granted that their will always be an abundance of food, do you know how to grow your own food?

  The entertainment industry likes to make what if programs and scenarios, would you survive a zombie apocalypse? Would you survive an alien invasion?  If the power went out, could you get it back? Always this need to restore thing to they way they were before... what if the answer isn't to go back to our foolish and self destructive ways? What is the true answer is to abandon all this ""wonderful"" technology for a far simpler way of life? The Amish people are an excellent example.  We ought to get back in tune with nature and rediscover what is truly important to us, life.

  If we as a species truly wish to survive this inevitable disaster, perhaps the way forward is not to spend all our moneys and efforts and talents on developing better and more efficient technologies. Tech will not save us from ourselves. In this, the land of the free, this beacon of light and truth, we spend trillions of dollars investing in newer and better ways of killing each other, problem? We cannot fight, force or will our way through this. Human understanding, humility, and cooperation is the only way forward.",,False,self,t5_2qhnj,False,,,True,t3_1ig9r3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/1ig9r3/technology_is_not_our_salvation_people_are/,

My eyes opened, the light from between the cracks in the trapdoor greeting me. I stood up, stretching, and began searching the room now that I had more light. My fire had left a spot on the floor blackened. The rest of the room was in more or less good condition. The shelf had one furry lump that looked like it used to be an apple, and the walls were bare besides a small cabinet.
 
I went to the cabinet to look for anything useful when I heard a rustling inside it. I brought out my hatchet, holding it over my shoulder, ready to strike. I carefully grabbed the handle to the cabinet and the rustling quieted down. I tightened my grip on my hatchet and threw the door open. A blur of brown flew from the cabinet, I swung my hatchet, swiftly decapitating the animal. I looked down at the body, still bleeding from it’s neck stump.

Squirrel.

I was shocked. I hadn’t seen much wildlife around. When the dead started walking most animals just disappeared. Either hunted to extinction or migrated to Canada and Mexico. The squirrel was thin, barely any meat there. But crappy meat is better than no meat.

I dug in, sinking my teeth into the squirrel’s tender flesh. I didn’t care about the fur, I didn’t care about the risks, I hadn’t had real meat in months. Flavor burst into my mouth, more flavor than anything I had tasted since I found the cattle farm several months ago. Before long the squirrel was gone besides a few stains of blood on my fingers, and I licked those clean too. I collected the bones to sell once I got to Container Town, Mickey always liked bones of any kind.

I gathered my pack, still licking the flavor from my lips, and walked to the trapdoor. I pressed my ear against the wood, listening for any disturbance topside. When satisfied that I was more or less safe I opened the door.
Light blinded me momentarily, I shielded my eyes with my hand. I climbed the small steps up to the shack and looked around. It was still morning so I had a good chance of making Container Town before nightfall.
A distant gunshot startled me. I turned toward the sound, pulled my goggles to my eyes and left the shack, swallowed by the desert. 

~

I had been walking for at least an a few hours now. My legs ached. I reached for my canteen and brought it to my mouth, savoring the few drops that came out. I was dehydrated. If i didn't get to Container Town soon, I would keel over out here.

I thought back to how I got here in the first place. A simple scavving job from Container Town, go out into the world and look for anything of value, anything that can be used by anyone. ""Back again before you know it"" they said. ""It will be simple"" they said. What a load of shit. Nothing is simple anymore. I stumbled, almost falling.

The dehydration mirages started. I saw a green oasis, a bar, things that shouldn't have been there. I saw massive walls, at least thirty feet high. Shots rang out around me, dust kicked up around my feet. I felt an impact in my arm, red swarmed my vision. I dropped to my knees.

The gates scraped open, darkness poured out. The darkness made shapes, men. I heard voices, shouting all at once. The darkness came for me, wrapping my body in shadow. I felt cold death pour down my throat. I tried to resist, but failed. I gave in.

Darkness enveloped me, smothering the flame.

~

Clarity. 

My head cleared, I could hear something moving about the room but my eyes had not adjusted to the darkness. A single flame illuminated the room, casting shadows that danced across the walls. The walls were rusted, metallic, looking rough to the touch. My eyes could make out more of my surroundings now. I lay on the floor, a small blanket between me and the ground. 

A small shadow at least half my size came towards me, slightly wobbling in step. I reached for my hatchet, but my fingers clawed at the empty air where my sheath had been. My weapons were gone. 

I scuttled backwards until I met the wall. The figure shambled in my direction, at a faster pace. My hands clawed at the wall and floor, searching for anything I could use but found none. I turned to my attacker and tackled it to the ground. A fist clocked me in the jaw, I felt it come loose. I struggled to form words from my broken jaw when I saw the attacker’s hand come up again now holding a half full bottle. 

It shattered across my face, tearing flesh and splashing me in cheap booze. I fell to the ground, clutching my bloodied face. The figure stood up and spoke to me.

“Sit the fuck down Marcus. I’m the doctor.”

A woman’s voice. Definitely not the doctor. I pushed my jaw back into place, flexing it a few times as well. The “doctor” walked to the wall and began working a pulley I hadn’t noticed. Once I was sure I could speak without mangling the English language I addressed her.

“You aren’t the doctor. Where’s Leonard?”

She shrugged, her shadow flickering across the wall. “Dead. Took in a patient that wasn’t exactly friendly. Stabbed poor Lenny in the eye with a Morphine syringe. I’m the only one around who had anywhere near as much medical experience as him.”

I struggled to my feet, using the wall as support. “Shame. I liked him. You wouldn’t happen to have a name would you?” 

She finished fiddling with the pulleys in the corner, a slot in the ceiling opened, flooding the room with sunlight. The woman stepped into the light. I caught my breath. She was beautiful. Her black hair was cut short, barely reaching her startlingly blue eyes. She smiled, her lips curling upward in a way that made my knees wobble. She extended her hand at stomach level. She was significantly shorter than me.

“Sydney, but I prefer Sid. As I’m sure you’ve noticed I am-“

At that moment my flawless social skills kicked in and I blurted, “MIDGET.”

Her fist connected with my crotch with surprising force. I collapsed to my knees, struggling for breath. Smooth Marcus. Smooth.

She turned away. “I prefer the term ‘small person,’” she walked to the wall, pulling open the door. White filled the doorway, blinding me. I held up a hand to stop the light. As I stepped into the white Sydney’s voice echoed behind me.

“And by the way, welcome back Marcus.”

What made /r/I_am_the_last_one so successful was the user content. We've created unique guidelines and rules to follow. We did this by taking the most popular ""recurring themes"" found in everyone's stories and created a type of ""rendezvous"" point in which everyone comes together to understand the ""most popular"" themes and include them in their stories.

I put it on facebook and it has had about 200 shares so I thought some people here might find it useful.

My Original Post -&gt; http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151320120839311

{{{4th Graders -&gt; Maya -&gt; Apocalypse}}}

 This morning I received this text message (below) from a grade school teacher friend who is frustrated:

 ""Btw! Why did your little friend translate the Mayan texts and freak people out?! I've got a bunch of 4th graders that keep freaking about the end of the world!"". 

 Well this really bothered me. I know plenty of adults are freaking out about the whole ""Maya Apocalypse"" thing on Friday, but grade schoolers? Grade school kids have already had a traumatic enough week and the last thing they need to be doing is ""freaking out"" over the ""end"" of the world.

 So this begs the question: Just why is everyone freaking out (and why do I care)? Well the main reason I care is that a lifetime ago it seems (and I guess 26 years is heading in that direction) I considered myself a Maya archaeologist and I had the opportunity to work with some of the greatest minds in the field of Maya archaeology at the Maya site of Copan in Honduras and several other sites in the Maya region. Working with these people left a big impression in me and has helped to fuel my desire to do my small part to set this story straight.

 So just why are people freaking out? The main reason is that if you listen to the media many outlets will tell you ""The Maya said the world will end on Dec 21st!"" which then leads into whatever story they want to push that night. But have you EVER actually read what the Maya said about the world ending? Thanks, you don't actually have to answer that. But since you are curious:

 This is what the text that has so many all riled up actually says. It is translated by the well respected Maya epigrapher David Stuart (who was one of my classmates back in Copan):

 ""The Thirteenth Bak'tun"" will be finished (on) Four Ahaw, the Third of K'ank'in. ? will occur. (It will be) the descent(?) of the Nine Support (?) God(s) to the ?."". 

 OH MY GOD! I WAS WRONG IT SAYS THE WORLD WILL… wait a minute… I must have missed something. Nope. You read it right. At no point does this simple bureaucratic text say anything about the end of the world. It really is that simple. Trust me, I am an archaeologist.

 You can stop reading here, but if you want to get your geek on read a bit more.

 Several important nerdy things to note:

 1: Bak'tuns are really long periods on a calendar, about 394 years (144,000 days to be exact).
 2: We are currently living in the 13th Bak'tun of their calendar (which means there were 12 before this one).
 3: The Maya make references to dates on other calendars far beyond the 14th Bak'tun (14th is the name of the next Bak'tun cycle that starts on Saturday).
 4: Just like we have said things like ""our calendar ends on December 31st, 1999"" (and 1998, and 2000, etc…) we don't feel the need to then say, ""but then it begins again on January 1st of the next year."". This is just like what the phrase in the Maya text ""The Thirteenth Bak'tun will be finished (on)"" means. That 13th calendar cycle is ending, the Maya did not feel the need to mention that the 14th Bak'tun starts the next day on our Saturday. Heck they were carving this stuff in stone, they needed to be concise with their words!
 5: What is the most future date you have ever heard? For lots of you it is what Fergie sung in the song Boom Boom Pow. Fergie sings ""Im so 3008, You so 2000 and late"". Just because Fergie only sings about 3008, does not mean that she does not expect there to be a 3009.
 6: The stelae (sculpture) this is from is fragmented (see the picture), so the ""?"" Are missing heiroglyphs.
 7: The descent thingy they reference is perfectly normal for the Maya to talk about and likely is referring to a statue(s) they would bring down (descend) from the top of a pyramid and parade around.
 8. The Nine Support Gods are likely these characters who routinely are referenced on other calendars. They are perfectly normal in the Maya mythology.

 [MY PROMISE] So where does that leave the 4th graders of the world? I will extend the same offer to all them in the Internet enabled world that I made to my friends class this morning. I PROMISE that if the world ends on Friday I will buy your entire class ice cream next week! (Please note, the ice cream might be kinda melted. ;-)

 Disclaimer: I wrote this rather quickly with a sick toddler interrupting me. So there might be some technical errors in this (sorry about that Dave!), but the general gist is correct.

At first it was just a small port that accidentally got a massive shipment of empty cargo containers. The workers hadn’t had time to correct it because they were torn apart within a week. All that was left was one half-working crane and hundreds of cargo containers scattered randomly around the port with blood stains punctuating each space in between. Eventually someone came along and used what was left of the crane to stack the containers into walls, buildings, and anything else he wanted before the crane crapped out on him.

People saw it as a sanctuary of sorts. Massive walls, a town of empty containers, what wasn’t to like? They cut into the containers with whatever they could find, making them into houses, shops, even an armory. One day an old bartender cut into what would be his new bar, and discovered a body. It was pretty much a skeleton by now, and everyone knew the story of how Container Town came to be, so everyone assumed it was the body of The Founder. The Founder’s body was buried in the town square. The bartender found a cross on him and keeps it hanging above his new bar, which he christened Repentance Bar. 

I found Container Town on my way down the coast looking for boats. I had barely any supplies so all I could do was keep walking until my body fell. I saw the walls from nearly half a mile away, and immediately used a grappling hook I had found in an outdoors shop to scale the wall.
Once I was safely over the wall I was greeted by a sudden silence. I had heard footsteps milling about but that had ceased when I touched the ground. I took my hatchet from the sheathe, creeping around a container. I was met with every citizen of this town pointing a gun right at me. Someone struck me from behind, knocking me out. 

When I came to I was surrounded by angry townsfolk with an assortment of weapons. They questioned me, even beat me a little. When they heard my story and determined that I was just some wanderer looking for refuge, they took me in. Gave me a place to call home. I helped wherever I could, be it reinforcing the wall or running out for supplies.

Now I was finally home. After two weeks of scavving the wasteland I had gathered enough supplies to warrant a return trip.

The rusted shells of containers greeted me when I emerged from the holding area Sid had me in. people milled about, going through their own routines. I took a deep breath, taking in the sounds, the smells, the life.
I had never felt more out of place with the living.

I made my way to the trading post near the main gates. I pulled back the curtain that served as a door, and ducked as a large stone soared over my head, whistling past my hair. “Nice try kid,” I shouted into the building. I stepped past the curtain, looking at the thirteen-year-old that served as my boss.

“Get your fuckin’ dumb ass in here Marcus! Who the fuck do you think you are coming and going whenever the fuck you want!” Joey was a little asshole. His parents getting killed turned him into a hard ass. When he arrived at Container Town one guy treated him like a baby, and even tried to adopt him. Joey responded by scooping his eye out with his hand. When we met, Joey and I instantly disliked each other. He frequently tries to kill me just to prove a point. 

“Well!? Do you have anything to show for your shitty efforts to make this town a better place,” Joey spat at me. I pulled the watch from my jacket pocket and threw it onto the table Joey sat on, intentionally hitting his leg.  “Give me my payment and go fuck yourself,” I told him. 

Joey took the watch in his grimy little hands as I sat at the table. His voice rang out suddenly. “There’s blood on this watch Marcus. Kill anyone interesting,” he taunted. My face darkened. “Just some raider,” I said.

Joey shook his head. He held his hands up in air quotes. “Just some raider? Bullshit.” He reached into his pouch, pulled a few crude coins that served at currency here, and threw them at me, bouncing them off my chest. I reached down to collect them.

“Get the fuck out of here Marcus, before I actually kill you. I’d be doing the world a favor, offing a fuckin’ scoundrel like you.” 

I leaped up and grabbed the little bastard by his neck, holding him off the table where his feet could barely touch the ground. I leaned in close, scowling. “Watch your mouth boy or you’ll see a real killer come out,” I growled. Joey squirmed in my grasp, struggling for breath. I saw his hand go for the knife in his boot, which took after removing one hand from his throat and held just out of his reach. I looked into his eyes. “Are you afraid boy?”

“MARCUS!” 

I looked to the doorway, seeing Marshall with his gun drawn. “Put the kid down. Now.” 

I shrugged. “If you insist sir.” I threw the boy away. He landed hard on the table, cracking it. 

Marshall sighed. “Come on Marcus. We should go.” He stepped aside so I could pass, but didn’t let me out of his sight. Joey’s voice echoed behind me. “Yea you better go you dumb fuck! You come back and ill fuckin’ beat the fuck out of you!” I twirled his knife in my hand, before turning and throwing it with deadly accuracy. The knife sliced his cheek, drawing blood, before firmly planting itself in the wall behind him with a solid thud. He spat and swore at meas I turned to leave, Marshall sighed before pushing me out the doorway.

~

Marshall was what qualified for a Sheriff in Container Town. He kept people from killing each other and in return the Town let him do whatever the fuck he wanted. Marshall always looked down at his “Civilians” like a Sheppard keeping his brain damaged sheep from mistakenly wandering into a wood chipper. 

I'm no saint, but I instantly disliked his misuse of power. He tried to control me like a dog on a leash, and failed. He still thinks he can gain some control over me. We almost always ended up in a fight, with Marshall on the losing side most of the time.

Now he holstered his gun and shoved me into the street, a crowd already gathering for the inevitable exchange of fists.

“Marcus,” Marshall said disdainfully while removing his duster. “You know I have to put you in your place now. You can’t just go around being a dickhead and not expect some sort of consequence.” 

Now I removed my coat and weapons as well. I laughed. “You don’t seem to understand the situation Marshall. Your empty threats don’t intimidate me in the least. If you keep going, I will not hesitate to beat the shit out of you. Again,” I spoke as much to him as the rapidly growing crowd around us. 

Marshall smiled wickedly, showing tobacco-stained teeth.
“This is your last warning Marcus!”

I smiled back.

“No Marshall, this is YOUR last warning.” 

He charged me, as I expected he would. Marshall hit hard, but he was reckless, wild. I ducked under his fist while grabbing his knee, throwing it to the side. Marshall lost his balance and fell to the ground, kicking up dust where he collapsed. The crowds cheered, as they had all been abused by Marshall at some point and, to be frank, were sick of his shit. 
Marshall climbed to his feet, dusting himself off. His face glowed red with anger or embarrassment.  He came at me again, this time succeeding in grappling me into a bear hug. He began to squeeze the breath out of me. I noticed a bit of exposed flesh on his shoulder and took my chance. I bit into him, digging my teeth into his flesh. He screamed, released me from his bear hug, and tried to tear me off his shoulder. 

He succeeded only in worsening the damage, tearing a chunk of his shoulder flesh away. He was on the ground now, I towered over him, the darkness in my eyes showing clearly.

“Marshall, consider this-“ I took his left hand in both of mine.

“-Your official retirement.” I crushed his hand, jagged tips of bones breaking skin and digging into my hand.

He wailed, clutching his ruined fist, cursing my name, swearing vengeance, just his usual bullshit. He actually turned to the crowd, begging for someone, anyone's aid. 

 His pleas for help fell on deaf ears.

Whilst the sudden withdrawal of power / heat would cause immediate deaths, how long would any survivors have to come up with a replacement energy source after they use up all the petrol and fossil fuel stocks in generators?

Update 06/07

[nahojjjen](http://www.reddit.com/user/nahojjjen) has helpfully come up with a new logo which you can see now in the top left. I hope to get other suggestions and we can rotate them around.

Thanks go to **JoeyMcFun** for explaining how the sidebar works!

If you feel the need to, you can now choose what particular type of Apocalypse you think will happen for your flair here, any feedback appreciated or additions / or shouts to get rid of it completely, I am not sure flair is a good thing but just seeing if anyone wants to own up to hoping the Zeds get them in the end.

I figure trying to survive by yourself can be done but mentally you may start to stray into insanity. I think 4 people is ideal 2 male 2 female. This way it's neither male dominated or female dominated and each sex has a same sex person they can relate to that the other sex couldn't. 

Now onto why it would be easier. Obviously less mouths to feed the better. With 4 people, especially 4 people that are already friends, you would all work together very cohesively and each would know that what they do matters and if they slack the results of them not doing the jobs they were set to do would result in immediate backlash by the others. In contrast a large group could have many members that slack and get away with it which could cause turmoil within the group. 

The simplistic social aspect of a group of 4 is much more ideal than having a larger group. This is where the 2 male and 2 female excels. Not to be sexist but in a survival situation I do feel comfortable in saying that the males would take the alpha positions, but with that said the females roles would not be diminished because of this. With only 2 males there may be a group leader but overall with such a small group all decision can be made together, there is no need for a leader per say. (Again not saying the females wouldn't play in a leadership role because they could.) With little real dispute between the members of the group they would all work towards the overall goal of survival.

A little background...I have entertained the possibility of various apocalypse scenarios, but ended up at this place through an incredible series of events.  After over a month of traveling on the wind, I was looking for an off-the-grid community of some sort, but this place was too good to pass up.

It is a multi-million dollar compound in a semi-remote location with 10 buildings on 100+ acres, and was created with the purpose of helping people after the world ends.  It can house and feed hundreds of people for over a year after ""the event"". However, there were never more than 8 people living there while I was there.  Shared beliefs include prophecies, nibiru, aliens, illuminati, bible codes, etc.  Most religions were accepted, however it was definitely intended to be a cult once things fall apart.

1302307650.0,1,self.Apocalypse,glv24,Sick of high gas prices? Fight back!,djtomr941,1,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/glv24/sick_of_high_gas_prices_fight_back/,"As oil consumers let's fight back against, oil companies, Wall Street speculators, and the FED with their cheap, easy money policies fueling massive inflation. Please forward this on. We can fight back if we all do this together and also hopefully put some more money back into our pockets and not in those of Wall Street or the oil companies!

We need to show big corporations and big government that we will not be pushed around. All of us working together can make a difference. We can speak with one voice.

What does not work? 

Not buying oil from any specific company for a day doesn't really do anything since oil is a global commodity and buying it elsewhere does not reduce demand.

What will work. Reducing demand.Prices are determined by supply and demand. There is no supply and demand problem. But, if supplies of oil build without us consuming it, it will eventually affect the price of oil and gasoline.

Driving strike.

Pick 2 days a week or more and do no driving. This can be a weekend or a weekday it does not matter.  

Instead carpool, take public transportation, walk, take a bike, or do something at home. This will have the biggest impact.

We use 18 million barrels of oil per day. If we can knock a day off our demand then that would add roughly 80-100 million barrels of gasoline to supplies which would pop the oil bubble. Current inventories are roughly 350 million barrels (which is at the higher levels we have ever had). 450 million would push speculators out of the market and make them take that cheap FED money and put it elsewhere. When you do drive, please follow the tips below to improve your gas mileage.

1.  Work from home if your company allows you too.
2.  Get a more fuel efficient car. Many now will allow you to double your gas mileage.
3.  If you are a company, try and move to a 4-day work week.
4.  Time trips to avoid traffic. Get to work early/late and leave early/late.
5.  Take public transportation if you can.
6.  Use map software to avoid traffic jams. A large amount of gas is wasted by idling vehicles.
7.  Turn off your car rather than let it idle.
8.  Drive less aggressively. Momentum is energy, braking is wasted energy. Quick acceleration and sudden stops are wasted energy.
9.  Properly inflate your tires and if the check engine light is on, get it looked at.
10. 55mph is the sweet spot. Every 10mph over the limit is 10% less fuel economy. Driving 85mph is dangerous and wastes 35% of your gasoline. You may also get a ticket.
11. Car pool with people from work if you can.
12. Intelligently plan your trips. Try to get everything in a set of stops.
13. Use Gasbuddy.com to find the lowest gas prices in your area.

This only deals with the demand situation. To increase supply, we need to drill for as much oil as we can in the US, but we also need to do it responsibly. Please write your congressman, representative, and even your President and tell him/her that you aren't happy with how our energy policy is being handled. Please add your own thoughts. Drilling for more oil will not bring prices down immediately, not like reducing demand will, however we can all benefit in the long term.

We need to send a message. We will not be pushed around.",,False,self,t5_2qhnj,False,,,True,t3_glv24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Apocalypse/comments/glv24/sick_of_high_gas_prices_fight_back/,

the most likely apocalypse would be...

evolved virus: this is now a days a pretty popular prediction for an apocalypse, a virus that would small your brain down to only thoughts of rage, hunger, and spreading the virus.

 if this were to happen our best chance to survive is to not go to a secluded house, farm, or cabin in the middle of no where.

 you would want to get to a meat locker, i know what your thinking ""why a fuckin meat locker? its cold as  shit in there"" well thats why you turn the cooling system down where you can manage living in there without the meat rotting away because you can use whatever meat in there as food.

explosives:
 you would want to make your own grenades so you can restock fast. a good grenade is to get a glass jar with alot of nails and bolts and get a few bullets for the charge you would use to activate your grenade.

take the gun powder out of the bullet and wrap it in plastic wrap and tap it towards the center of the jar, next get some thread and use that as your fuse, put a small hole in the jar lid and put it through there and into your charge. and activation is pretty obvious by now.

weapons: 
dont use guns because the noise would only draw in more infected, the grenade listed above would be the same noise level but it can take out and/or damage alot more infected that one bullet, rapid fire would cause alot of echos.

the best weapon you can probably get is a self-cocking crossbow since you can use the arrows A.K.A bolts to stab when up close or shoot them from a distance.

 a back up in case your pinned or cant get to your crossbow would to have a knife with any holes throughout the blade, the holes act as air pockets making it easy to pull out when stabbing, DO NOT TRY TO CUT OFF LIMBS, its VERY important you dont try to dismember an infected, the blade will cut in the bone and get stuck.

for a blunt weapon you should get an aluminum bat and and mold concrete towards the top, it sounds bullshit i know, but it would last longer and give a bigger chance of a one hit kill.

transport:
this one is gonna be fun, if you plan to get around or out of the city your best option would be to pack light, have a VERY reliable group, and move quick and quiet. cars make too much noise and bikes...lets not go there.

moving on foot is the best option since it helps raise your endurance and stamina while being the most quiet way. dont get attached to one of your hideouts because your gonna be moving alot to lower your chances of infected stumbling across you.

misc. helpful tips:
lets say your trying to leave a building and theres a few idle infected standing there, would you try to find a different way around? try to kill them quietly? or would you be smart and distracted them?.

if that situation happens, go with distraction, toss an object towards the opposite of where you wanna go so they chase the noise and not you.

if any of you plan to hold onto your good morals when the shit hits the fan then your not gonna like me in this next part. if theres a group of infected coming and theres some asshole whos hassling you for whatever reason you would have to do this so your live, you would want to incapacitate him so he would scream and draw attention away from you. success comes with sacrifice.

trading is a good way to meet new allies and get useful items for yourself, its best to no try to haggle down the price as it will piss off the seller and would be another enemy to you. like i said above, success comes with sacrifice.

armor:
for armor...ill let you have fun with that part.

The problem I'm facing is getting this project going, crowdfunding is like a train going up a hill. 80 percent of projects that reach 20 percent of their goal reach their final goal, 90 percent for 30 percent, etc. I JUST put this project up and I'm getting nowhere, but I think this project would be awesome so I'm working on getting it spread across the interwebs.

My username is NexusXtremeOne, but you can call me Nex.

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset, I figured that given a few years, things would return to normal and maybe be even better that ever.

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, we were fed a metanarrative. A narrative where everything was right with the world, everything would end with a happy ending, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

Long story short: Our generation and our future is doomed to the same scenario John B. Calhoun created in his mouse utopia.

That is why I am making this proposal. An alliance between subreddits with the aim of finding salvation for our generation and world. The Occupy movement has good ideas, but they're horribly organized and very prone to infiltration.The following are being considered as member candidates for this NexGen Alliance:
