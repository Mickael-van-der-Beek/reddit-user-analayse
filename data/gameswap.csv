Hello gameswap,

[Context](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/lh3xs/h_deus_ex_human_revolution_300_copies_steam_w_any/)

Let me start off by saying how incredibly sorry and disappointed I am at the recent turn of events.  I don’t know how to accurately convey my feelings at this time so let me be just get right to the point:

I was fired this morning thanks to a few dozen phone calls from whom I assume to be redditors.  At 9:12 AM, the day had barely begun but already I had 3 voicemails from the weekend.  Thinking nothing of it, I decided to grab a coffee and returned to a page from the receptionist who was annoyed that a few people had been trying to reach me since ‘she got in (7:45 AM)’

I assumed that this was work related as it is not uncommon to have a busy Monday morning due to issues that arise over the weekend.  The first voicemail was routine but the other two were from a redditor who – you guessed it – wanted DX:HR codes.  This person who left no name or contact information, simply stated that he knows when I am getting my shipment in; he knows my name and work number and that he would let the appropriate people know that I am stealing.  My heart started racing because I had been forbidden by the powers that be to let anything about this be traced back to the company (but was allowed to use the codes as I saw fit.)

With my head pounding and throat dry, I flipped to the other voicemail.  This time, the mystery redditor let me know that he would be creating a throwaway account and expected a PM of all the keys that came in today for his silence.  I found this despicable but he left me no other recourse.  I resigned myself to the fact that I would have to do this in the evening when the keys came in, but alas the problems only escalated from here.

I resumed working, visibly uncomfortable and nervous, and this is when I got my first of many live call.  The callers demands ranged from a few codes, to all the games on my pre-trade list and a select few wanted everything.  Initially I denied that I had anything to do with reddit, gameswap or DX:HR but one caller recited my CEO’s home,  cell and work number and knowing that it was only a matter of time before things escalated beyond my control , I decided I should come clean.  I decided to inform my CEO of the developments and as I walked into his office, I heard him swearing at the ‘people from the internet.’  The receptionist, the CEO, a few people in my department and myself received a grand total of 138 unsolicited phone calls.  Some were polite and were wondering if they could have one code and some were very threatening and demanded near everything I had.

I was initially suspended without pay and as I was packing up a few things, I was full out terminated for breaching company policy (that I had signed when hired).  The whole ordeal has shaken my faith in humanity but my faith in reddit as a whole remains strong.  Out of the many hundreds or thousands that saw my post, only 138 of you decided to be selfish.

I am sorry for disappointing everybody and rest assured that the people who sent me codes, I have NOT used them.  The people who pre-traded me games, I will return them at my earliest opportunity, and the people who I promised codes for free,  as soon as I get back on my feet, I will be purchasing a copy for you guys.

**Tl;dr**
Got fired, returning pre-traded games.

-----------------------------------

**Updates:**

* Anybody who bought items specifically to trade with me, such as DLC for something you do not own or tiny worthless games that they have no use for and/or cannot trade away, I have a very limited number of games that I can offer you - courtesy of **blueshiftlabs, phyxius149 and craftables** - as compensation for your now worthless piece of software.

* I have been reading this thread and want to thank all you guys for your support.  Today I will attempt to figure out if it was an inside job, and then review my options and plan for the future. **EDIT: Most probably not an inside job, according to me atleast.** 

* Now that I have calmed down a bit, I would be happy to answer any questions you might have to the best of my ability.  Gameswap in no way deserves a reputation hit due to what I consider to be mostly my fault.  I disregarded the first rule of the internet - Be Cautious. (In hopes that your questions do  not get lost in the sea of comments, please ask them [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/ln84v/h_an_apology_w_your_forgiveness_understanding_and/c2uamrl))  Although you can post it anywhere and when I find it, I will answer it.

I found this nifty place via /r/all. I noticed that you guys tag your posts with your country. A while back I [set up a system in /r/ILiveIn](http://www.reddit.com/r/ILiveIn/comments/fb371/usa_you_can_now_add_flags_to_your_posts_on/) to automatically add a flag to posts.

To quote that thread:
***
To add a flag to your post in /r/gameswap you can do so by following these steps:

1. Locate your country code from the list below.
2. When [creating a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/submit), simply put your country code **at the beginning of your title**. (See this post title for an example.)
3. Your flag should automatically show up on your post.  

Simple as that!

**Notes:**

* Flag selections were based off of population and past /r/ILiveIn posts. I will be adding more when I can, and will swap out countries if I need to, so these are subject to change.
* **These flags will only work on self (text) posts.**
* You will need to have `allow reddits to show me custom styles` checked in your [preferences](http://www.reddit.com/prefs/) in order to see the flags.
* The flags will only show up while viewing /r/gameswap.
* Country codes were taken from [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3).

***

That being said, I'll stick around a while to gage everyones reactions (If you don't like I can remove it, etc.).

Another note: The code can sometimes incorrectly tag a post. If you start a self post with the word ""can"", you're getting a Canadian flag, eh. If something like that happens a mod can tweak the CSS code to remove it. I made it so the code ignores everything but the very beginning of the title so any use of the word ""can"" elsewhere in the title won't trigger a flag.

###**The code doesn't like when you use two brackets without a space at the beginning of your title. Leave a space between your first two brackets (country code first!) to ensure the code picks up your country code!**

It'll keep things nice!

Okay, we understand that you don't like getting scammed. We don't like getting scammed, and the community doesn't like getting scammed. That DOES NOT give you the right to post users' information publicly, Private Messages (note the whole private part) or other personal information. if you have information pertaining to a scammer, repress the urge to publicly humiliate them and PM the mods.

If a situation does arise, please message the mods with the user in question, screencap any PMs you have and send them to the mods only. WE will then take care of it. 

Crossposting in multiple subreddits about a scammer and trying to get people riled up can only hurt your case. Harassing others may seem like the way to go, but remember that if you push those buttons too much, they may delete their accounts and proceed to do nothing, after all, it can't get much worse, right?

And in case you didn't hear it the first time: DO NOT POST USERS' INFORMATION PUBLICLY. This is not only a /r/gameswap policy but also a reddit wide policy. Posting personal information publicly, whether as a post or a comment will result in an insta-ban from the mods and perhaps a ban from reddit as well (if the admins get whiff of it).

So for clarity's sake

DO NOT

* Post user's information publicly

* Organize an internet mob after a scammer

* Take matters into your own hands. We the mods are here to moderate (and clean out the spam filter). We can handle it. Trust us.

DO

* Send the mods a PM (send to #gameswap) with the scammer's name, PM logs and other information

* Be patient

* Let the mods take care of it.

* Post console names in front of haves and wants, to make it easier to read like: USA (PS3) H: Derpington II W: Herp ES Edition 

Thanks, and sorry if this seems to be a bit blunt. We just need yall to abide by reddit policy of not posting user information and not to organize internet mobs because that is never the way to go, and it will never get anything accomplished.

* Digital for Digital swaps (steam, origin, ea store etc) will be removed. Please go to /r/steamgameswap if you wish to continue trading codes.

* Digital for Physical swaps are allowed, but in these cases, **the physical person must ship the physical item FIRST**. After the digital guy receives the item will the digital guy send his item. This is so if the physical guy is a scammer, nothing is lost (since digital guy did not send his side). If the digital guy is a scammer, we have his name and address. FOLLOW THIS RULE.

* Digital account trades of any kind (even for physical items) will be removed because it's too easy to take back accounts through email/password resets.

Okay, and onto the reasoning.

As we all know, there's been an influx of /v/ scammers in here, and it's messed up stuff for the rest of us. We took a poll [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/itc0b/message_from_the_mods_its_time_to_sound_off_and/), and the vote was split evenly 20/20 for banning steam swaps. The mods discussed it and decided that banning steam swaps from here is the best idea for the community.

This was a hard decision to come to, and none of us really like this outcome, but the other option of letting scammers run rampant (or even making the subreddit private) is much worse. 

As of now, we will not require a time limit or karma limit for posting here because we believe that the removal of steam swaps will solve the scammer issue.

**FOR THOSE MIGRATING TO /r/STEAMGAMESWAP**

We don't particularly like the idea of pushing the burden elsewhere, so that's where you'll step in. If yall could look out for each other and make sure that the people are legit and aren't scammers, that would be in the best interest of the reddit community as a whole. BEWARE of new accounts, old accounts with little activity and throwaway accounts. the /v/ scammer montythegent/manlytears has many accounts, some of which are old.

Even in the midst of this change in gameswap, continue practicing vigilence in trading. Check out your partner, make sure he's legit and not a scammer. new account age, few comments on an old account are indicators that you should proceed with caution. Mushrooms are a general indicator of a trustworthy trader, but still check out your partner and make sure he's not shady.

DONT BE STUPID. BE THOROUGH AND BE CAREFUL

SliferNoSlifing


Now if you're one of these traders, just ship your side of the deal, and this will go away. It might be a result of bad communication or personal problems or whatever, but as long as you can ship it out with DC#, tell your guy and let us (the mods) know, it'll be cool. Just get it shipped out now.

**For everyone else, a review of security:**

* In general, you want the nonmushroomed individual to ship first in a mushroom vs no mushroom trade. You are entering into a HIGH RISK trade if you ship first to a NON mushroom or to a new or inactive account. It's not a hard rule, but it should be a common sense, personal rule to let the non mushroom ship first. BE SAFE NOT STUPID

* Always, ALWAYS, ALWAYS^ALWAYS ship with a Delievery Confirmation or other tracking number. This helps if your guy claims to never have received the game or if you actually shipped it out etc. It costs 80 cents. I mean, that's a snickers bar, and snickers aren't even that good (twix all the way). BE SAFE (and slightly hungry) NOT STUPID

* Remember that steam and digital trades are the most dangerous ~~game~~ trades simply because you don't put a physical address out there. Make sure that the person you're trading with is trustworthy, and it wouldn't hurt to keep a chat going outside of steam via email chat, facebook, skype or something. But be warned, it is still extremely, extremely dangerous. BE SAFE NOT STUPID

* So yeah, use common sense and you'll weed out 90% of the bad trades out there.

**But for those bad trades**: Don't post in /r/gameswap, send a message to the mods (send a pm to #gameswap. There's a button above the mod box too to do that) and provide any information you may have, which includes DC#s, chat logs, chat screencaps, addresses etc.

And for those bad traders who are still here trying to scam, in the words of Liam Neeson:

&gt;I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. But what I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.

Oh, but wait, we do know who you are, we know where you are.

* Posting format **[country] [H] games you have (system) / [W] games you want(system)**. This is the standard format and it works for everything. You should always include a system. If one isn't included, the post will likely end up in the spam filter before seeing the light of day or we will be deleting them and asking you to re-post with the edited title. 
* **NO HOSTILITY**. There is simply no room for it here. It will not be tolerated. If you are shown to have a hostile nature, it would be safe to say that you will get one warning. If it happens again, you could be banned. **If there is a problem with anyone, bring it to us.**
* Be careful. With the setup and guidelines we have, if you get scammed, it is your fault. 

Also be accepting of our trading guidelines towards newer people (you guys). 

** *general trade guideline* **

* No mushroom with no mushroom - newer redditor goes first.
* One person with mushroom - person without mushroom goes first.
* Two with mushrooms - newer redditor goes first.

It's not a fail-proof system but it helps more than it hurts. Of course you don't have to go by that but be ready for older, mushroomed swappers expecting you to send out your games first. If you don't want to, don't get pissy about it but be ready for that user to back out of the trade. 

That's all I have to say for now. Stay safe, and have fun.

_________________________
_________________________


**First**: You'll notice that in the sidebar, the ""[Browse Trades](http://www.rgameswap.com/list.pl#/button/c/green/p/left/)"" button has been restored.  User /u/H2iK runs the site, and recently announced ([in his PSA from yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/167wcm/psa_rgameswap_i_have_updated_and_rehosted_my/)) that there were some updates, and that it was functioning once again. If you've neglected the button in the past - please consider giving it a try - it functions much better than the reddit search - you can even filter by some systems. 

Also in the sidebar, in the button section - there is a [shared ban list](http://x.bluesl.net/BanList#/button/c/orange/p/right/). This list compiles the names banned from gameswap and some of our sister subreddits.  If you live for risk and accept trade offers via PM (which we don't promote or endorse - nor do they count towards flair...) at least check the shared ban list for the users name to make sure. 

^^^Thanks ^^^Lama.

_________________________
_________________________

**Second**: Please occasionally read the FAQ and/or Wiki.  They are similar, so reading both isn't necessary.  Also - read the sidebar every now and then.  Things don't change often, but after mod messages or announcements, it's likely something has changed.  Feel free to edit the wiki yourself - there are some requirements, but they aren't astronomical. (We can revert any ""vandalism"" and your username shows up, so consider that an instant ban.) 

_________________________
_________________________

**Third**: Be respectful to each other. Following users from post to post, calling them a scammer, using derogatory names, acting like a middle schooler - not how we want this community to act. Don't thread crap - if you have an issue with someone - message them, or better yet - ignore them.  If you see something like that - report it, and message the mods. We don't censor or ban swearing, but calling someone a ""faggot"" doesn't belong here - ***ever*** - even if you're trying to make a funny. 

Zero tolerance for thread crapping. Zero tolerance for being an asshole.

Specifically Steam swaps. Don't be afraid to give out ideas. We want to know how you guys can help this subreddit run with less risk and please please please let us know what you're thinking. **End Edit**

We have been taken over by a few assholes on v/ boards of 4chan. We still have our inner circle of scammers that were here before v/ showed up. 

We want to hear your ideas. It is time to get your guys take on this situation. We have come up with 3 solutions that we want you guys to work off of so that we may see what will wind up best for this community. 4chan and other scammers have really made these past few weeks hard on the mods and our *fair* demeanor is dwindling. So if you guys want to have any say in this, get in here and decide on something before we have to decide for you. 

What we propose. 

* We completely Ban Steam/Account swaps. Minecraft, WoW, etc.

* We place limits on who can post here. What we propose is 2 months activity with at least 200 comment Karma. 

* We make r/gameswap a private community only allowing entrance for who we screen extensively. 

**Now these aren't things we will be doing** They are just ideas of what it might come to. We want you guys to work off that and come up with something better. 

I think if it comes down to making r/gameswap private, A good way we could do this without too much hatred from the rest of the community we could probably have an open r/gameswap day where something is posted in r/gaming and other gaming subreddits telling people to subscribe before we close back down at the end of the day. It would be hard for potential scammer to time it right without viewing those gaming subreddits daily. **Again just an idea.**


**IMPORTANT UPDATES**

We will be getting a compiled list of all zip-codes related to mailing scams, and it will be posted to the side-bar for you all to see. Check this regularly. The mods have a list of the actual addresses attached to those zip-codes so if you get a hit on one of the zips then message us and we will see if it matches a past scammer. This will be done.

We will also be putting a link to a U.S. mail fraud form on the side-bar. If you get scammed by mail, then you should fill one of these out. This will only help against mailing scammers. For all the foreign swappers, if you know of the links for foreign mail fraud, just give them to us and we will get these up as well. 

If you conduct a trade inside a PM, we are not responsible if you get scammed. We are here trying to safeguard from scams and there have been people getting messaged by former members of gameswap that have at one point made it to our ban list and even posted on r/Badkarma. 

Thank you thank you thank you for all the members who have posted screencaps in the mod message box of scammers plotting on v/. Every little bit helps.

We do this to ensure that every user has an equal opportunity for 'front page space.'  If we didn't have this in place, or had a lower limit, our front page would be constantly filled with posts from ""power users"" who have larger lists, newer games etc.

###""What can I trade here?""

[See this.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq#WhatcanItradehere)

We are not doing this to be difficult - we do this because there are other subreddits better suited for certain trades.  Digital for digital swaps belong in /r/SteamGameSwap (with few exceptions).  Any type of post asking for/offering money or paypal belongs in /r/gamesell.  If money comes up organically after you negotiate a trade and nothing is working, that's fine.  If you want to throw in a few bucks via paypal to even out a one-sided deal, that's fine too.  

There seems to be confusion regarding PC games mostly.  I'll try to simplify that.  If you have a ***physical copy*** of a PC game, it is 100% welcome/allowed here.  If you have a ***digital copy*** of a PC game or an ***account***, you may trade it here *if you are looking for offers for* ***physical*** *games or other gaming related items.*  If you have ***digital games***, or ***accounts***, and you are looking for ***digital games***, or ***accounts*** please use /r/SteamGameSwap. 
_________________________________
###Thread crappers

What is a thread crapper?  Someone who is in the thread, and is involving themselves without bringing anything to the trading block - mostly this applies to those people who feel the need to judge someone else's swap.  ""That deal sucks"" or ""What a ripoff!"" are examples of thread crapping and will be dealt with using a 7-day temp ban, even for a first offense.  If you *are involved in the trade* and feel that you're getting a bad offer just remember the first rule of the internet.  Wheaton's Law: DBAD.  If you get a lowball offer, or an offer that you feel insulted by - DON'T BE A DICK.  Say ""thanks, but that doesn't work for me"" and counter-offer, or just sever ties with that trader.  It's not hard to not be a dick.
__________________________________
####The following are not rules per se, but need to be addressed all the same.

##Be courteous and respond to all offers.

A simple 'thanks but no thanks' or something along those lines works if you don't like the offer.  Cut and paste if you need to.  It's just courtesy - and it allows that user to move on or make another offer.

##List your games and/or wants

Going into someone thread and dropping this ""here's a [link] to my post - interested?"" doesn't achieve the goal of posting in the first place.  You've linked to your post, but what are you looking for?  If you do this, please try to add this to that type of comment: ""here's a [link] to my post - I'm looking at your Tales of Awesomia G and/or Uncharted Halo Racer 6 - interested?""

1325086214.0,53,self.gameswap,ntncp,[MOD MSG] Significant Change to Community Coming Soon,bsturtle,85,32,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/ntncp/mod_msg_significant_change_to_community_coming/,"**TL;DR**

**PURE DIGITAL SWAPS ARE BANNED AFTER DEC 31ST**

**Edit: Please read this [excellent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/ntncp/mod_msg_significant_change_to_community_coming/c3bu83o). this [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/ntncp/mod_msg_significant_change_to_community_coming/c3bupxq) too**

r/gameswap has evolved greatly since its inception just over 2 years ago. It began with a community of just a few and grew into, considering what it does, a huge community with many different ideas of what it should be and what they want from it.

During this time there have been a few ""splinter communities"". Some successful, others not. It started with the UK and CAN gameswap, then the AUS gamswap. r/gamecollecting, r/retrogameswap and r/gamesell came next. r/steamgameswap was created sometime during this growth, along with r/hardwareswap. Most recently r/steamcoupons was created to help battle the flood of coupon trades. All these communities came into being because someone thought that there was something missing from r/gameswap. Or that there was too much in r/gameswap.

About 6 months ago a decision was made to ban digital trades because of the recent influx of scammers. It wasn't as bad as it seemed, but it was heartbreaking for the moderators and the community. We were freaked out. The ban on digital trades at that time was really a knee jerk reaction. It lasted about a week before we decided that the community should be able to decide what it wants and that they did so at their own risk. I have to say, it turned out well. Scams are fewer now as more people use common sense about their trades and trade partners.

During all this time, Steam trades (along with other digital platforms) has slowly taken over the front page of r/gameswap. 9/10 posts are for a Steam or other digital trade. And don't get me started on coupons and coal. Currently there is no good place to go for physical swappers to be seen.

This is about to change.

The moderators of this community are in unanimous support of turning r/gameswap into a more focused community of trades. This essentially means that no more pure digital trades will be allowed. r/gameswap will instead focus on what it did in the past, physical swaps. Because there still needs to be some kind of catch all for ""other"" swaps, I'll outline what will be allowed and what will not be allowed:

**Physical for Physical swaps: This includes console games, PC games, console hardware, and misc items as long as one end of the deal is game related (e.g. accordion for xbox). DLC content is eligible as well**

**Physical for digital: Since r/steamgameswap title is for steam games, I'm not sure if they allow physical game swaps as well. In any case, these will be allowed here, however you will need be sure that Steam (or whatever platform) is at the beginning of the submission title so that it will be flagged.**

**Physical or Account for account: Since account swaps are so far and few between those will still be allowed. Note, this is the only pure digital swaps allowed.**

**Pure digital: these swaps will not be allowed. there is a community for steam swaps. please take them there.**

**Pure purchase and sales: these offers are already banned and will continue to be banned.**

**Giveaways, begging, and IOUs: these are currently banned and will remain banned as well.**

**Following r/steamgameswap's lead, we will also be banning HIB swaps. HIB is a great thing and we feel that it is being taking advantage of. Usually we don't take a moral stance on such swaps, but in this case we are making an exceptions.**

**r/mushroomkingdom will be opened to all swap reddits for meta discussion and tracking of trades if they want.**

**We will enforce stricter submission guidelines. Instead of preferred, the posting formats in the FAQ will be required. **

So, what does this mean for the community? Well, it means a lot of you are going to be pissed off. I'm ready to take the heat. I expect the number of subscribers to drop drastically, as well as the number of successful trades. However, I also expect to see the number r/steamgameswap subscribers to increase and the number of trades there to increase.

You might argue that this is a also a knee jerk reaction. But it has been a long time coming. If this community has become 90% steam trades, then the steam trades need to move on. I've struggled quite a bit with this decision, to the point of creating r/consolegameswap (currently private) and leaving this community. But after discussion with some old timers and the current moderators, we have decided to try this course of action first. The main argument for this direction is that if there is a digital community that exists, then it should be used.

To alleviate the need to monitor two communities and cross posts, you can view any number of communities by combing them in the URL. So, http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap+steamgameswap allows you to browse both communities simultaneously. 

This change will be effective January 1st. It will last at least a month. If we see that this community has died, then we'll reverse it. 

I can't say for sure this is the best decision made for this community. But all the moderators believe something needs to be done. Let's try to keep the ensuing discussion civil. This submission will replace the FAQ at the top of the page for the time being. If anyone knows how to make that bigger, please let me know. This needs as much visibility as possible.

1361209894.0,45,self.gameswap,18rf2z,[MOD]  Safe Swapping Boot Camp - YOUR ATTENDANCE IS REQUIRED!,shoot2scre,51,6,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/18rf2z/mod_safe_swapping_boot_camp_your_attendance_is/,"Alright guys and gals (hey... it could happen),

We need to sit down and talk about safe swapping practices again.  We're attempting to lock things in on our end to ensure safer swapping for all you guys by being more stringent on handing out mushrooms... especially to first time/new swappers.  

The guidelines in the FAQ, including account age, are going to be followed.  We will discuss internally and based on your discussion and remarks, re-instituting a Karma requirement for Mushrooms as well.  

Ultimately we see a small pattern where new users are 'self-confirming' swaps between newly made accounts, and then using their blue-shrooms to scam unsuspecting swappers.  We are keeping our eyes on this behavior more carefully now.  If we find something suspicious, we might refuse to give a Mushroom, or outright ban someone if we believe the evidence in our possession warrants it.  

At the end of the day, it is incumbent upon YOU, the swapper, to thoroughly vet your trade partner.  That means, stalking their comment/posting history and trying to decide if this is someone you want to swap with.  Also, please note the Recommended Trade Order from the FAQ:

----------

&gt;These are only guidelines, but we can't see why any reasonable person should object.

&gt;Who Goes First:

&gt; 1.  No mushroom with no mushroom - newer redditor goes first.

&gt; 2. One person with a mushroom - person without mushroom goes first.

&gt; 3. One with higher tiered mushroom - lower tiered mushroom goes first.

&gt; 4. Two with the same mushroom - newer redditor goes first.

&gt; Notes:

&gt; These are only guidelines but they really do help the Swap go smoothly.

&gt; Nothing replaces proper vetting.

&gt; Even with these guidelines in place you should only make trades you comfortable with, with people you are comfortable with, regardless of trade order.

&gt; You trade at your own risk. Following these guidelines does not guarantee a successful trade. Only increases the chances.

&gt; If you recognize you trade at your own risk, you can do whatever you want. Feel free to ignore these.

----------------------

1. You should not just look at a mushroom (especially a blue shroom) and consider that 'assurance' that you won't get scammed.  Take your time, do your homework on the other user, and make sure you are 100% satisfied with the terms and conditions before swapping.  

2. If you have an older account, and a higher tiered mushroom and the other user refuses to ship first, JUST. WALK. AWAY.  If something smells fishy... JUST. WALK. AWAY.  

3. If you are the 'newer user' and you're concerned about shipping first, try to deal with more established and trusted swappers while you are still the newbie, and still expected to ship first.  

4. If you're swapping with a new user, there is no harm in waiting for their package to arrive before shipping your end.  As long as you've maintained communication and had that open dialogue with your swapping partner it is something that is not only allowed but encouraged (especially with newer users).  

--------

If you guys have any tips of your own, or suspect something fishy please do not hesitate to share them here or message us.  

Remember, take pictures, use delivery confirmation and walk away if you think the other user is up to something fishy.  The number of good swappers here far outweigh the bad.  Even if you walk away from one swap, there will likely be another offer right around the corner.

It has been a little while since our last mod post, but in light of some recent events, we feel as though it is time for another one.

###We have some new rules for you:

1.   Begging for Games = Ban. The whole point of /r/gameswap is to give up something you have for something you want. It is not the place to tell your story about how you can't afford this or that. If you want something for free, there are subreddits that you can visit. If we see you begging for games, you'll be banned.



2.   Your Games on Your Account.  DO NOT trade your friends' games. Your thread will be immediately removed. A reddit account is free to create, so everyone can have one. With that said, there is no need for you and a friend or a brother or a cousin or a roommate to share a thread. If we see your thread saying these belong to [insert relationship to you here], we will remove your thread. If you reply to a comment with 'I have to check with the person the game *actually* belongs to', we will remove your thread. This also means one account=one person, there will be no account sharing on /r/gameswap.

3.   Swaps with local friends or relatives WILL NOT count toward flair. That's not the purpose of this place. If you want to swap games with your friends, pick up the phone and call them. 

Any questions regarding these new rules, please post them here or message the mods. The sidebar has been updated, so 'I didn't know' ***will not*** be accepted as an excuse.


---

Another issue that seems to be a lot more frequent recently is violating the 7 day rule. At /r/gameswap, we allow you **ONE** new post every 7 days. This has not nor will it change anytime soon. If you delete your thread but post another one before your 7 days is up, your new one will be removed. You will then have to wait another 7 days for a new post.  Also, please be aware that, from the [FAQ.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/wiki/faq#from-tab)

&gt;**Deleting and reposting to try to circumvent the rules may result in a ban.**

There are warnings and safeguards in place so that you can double and triple check your post before submission. Please make sure it says what you want it to say before clicking that SUBMIT button.

Also, if you use an alt account to circumvent the rule, all accounts associated with you will be banned. You can use /r/gameswap with one account. If you use a different account in other subreddits, that's your prerogative. However, we will not allow one person to trade under more than one name.

---

Lastly, please avoid threadcrapping. If you don't think someone's offer to you is fair, just say no thank you. There is no reason for any bitterness or hostility. As far as someone's offer to someone else, stay out of that.
 
It is not your place to tell someone what their item is worth, so please avoid doing so. 

---

Please upvote this for visibility. I don't personally care about imaginary internet points, but everyone needs to read this and understand.

Thanks for your time,

***NOW GO GET SWAPPIN'!***

[See here](https://help.ea.com/article/online-pass-has-been-discontinued) for details.

The following titles have had the online pass added to Xbox Marketplace for free or removed from the game all together:

* Alice: Madness Returns
* Battlefield 3
* Battlefield: Bad Company 2
* Bulletstorm
* Dead Space 2
* Dead Space 3
* Dragon Age 2
* Dragon Age: Origins
* Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning
* Mass Effect 2
* Mass Effect 3
* Medal of Honor
* Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit
* Need For Speed: The Run
* Need For Speed: Shift 2
* Skate 3
* The Sims 3

... with additional titles to receive free online pass updates very soon. 

###As such - it's probably fair that we ban the swapping of online passes for EA titles eventually, but definitely for Xbox starting immediately.

*  Treat everyone with respect. I cannot stress this enough.  Everyone here is trying to enjoy themselves.  The mods work very hard to make sure this place is open and fair to everyone.  
*If you don't follow the rules, you're going to have a bad time.*

Seriously guys... the moderator team works very hard here to make sure everyone has a level playing field and an equal shot at the front page.  If you have a problem with a rule, or a suggestions to improve the sub... LET US KNOW!! There is a big GREEN button on the sidebar that says, SUGGESTIONS... I wish it was used more often. We are always open to ideas and ways to improve this community.  None of us get paid for this... all of us have lives, jobs, spouses, school, etc.  I just wanted to take a second to remind everyone to treat everyone else here with respect.  

We're all here to get good video games on the cheap... 

So let's keep it simple and civil.  

Remember to practice safe swapping... always use confirmation.  

---

**IMPORTANT EDIT/UPDATE [THREAD-CRAPPING]**: 

In the same context that we WILL NOT tolerate users being assholes... we will not tolerate thread-crapping.  If someone makes the OP an offer that you think is TOO low... he will probably get turned down.  You do NOT need to call out the user, in the thread.  Any comments that are determined to interfere with the 2 users involved in a potential swap is viewed as thread-crapping.  If you are not part of the swap, you should not be involved with it.  You are not the ""hero gameswap needs"".  If a user continually makes low-ball offers, his punishment will be continual rejection.

Remember: VALUE IS SUBJECTIVE.   

There is no need for you to interfere or to publicly embarrass another user because YOU SUBJECTIVELY didn't like his offer.  If the OP decides to ACCEPT an offer, than obviously he wants to make that swap because SUBJECTIVELY he likes it.  It does not matter what the OP's motivation is in making the swap.  If you think a swap is SOOO lopsided that it demands attention DO NOT post in the users trade thread.  You can either message the user you think is getting ripped off PRIVATELY, or message the mods and we'll address the situation if we determine it is warranted.  

It has ALWAYS been the policy here that the terms of a swap are to be left to the individuals involved.  Therefore, if you're not involved in the swap, your opinion on the quality or relative fairness, is irrelevant.  If you decide to PUBLICLY stick your noise into someone else's swap understand that you have been warned.  Thread-crapping WILL lead to banning.  

Publicly embarrassing another user, provoking arguments, or interfering in swap that you are not involved in will not be tolerated.

you've always wanted!",kaintehdragoon,50,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/jb3zy/kaintehdragoons_rgameswap_hints_get_that_trade/,"Hey gang. I've been a member of r/gameswap for quite some time now and I’ve noticed lately that many users are having troubles getting the trades they desire. I see many posts without any comments, which is disappointing. Don't worry though, I'm here to help.


A good start is in the title of your post. Being specific can really help. If you have a large lot of games, try and highlight a few of the more popular ones. A title that goes:

* [H]360 Games [W] Offers

Isn’t probably going to get much attention. A post titled:

* [USA] [H] Lots of 360 games (Reach, AC Brotherhood, Others) [W] Different games (CoD BO, offers)

Is going to draw in more people as it is more specific. People have a mindset of what you have to offer and what you are looking for. Honestly, I’m less inclined to look at posts that just say [W] Offers, and I know other r/Gameswappers that feel similarly. The more details, the better you are going to do.


Another helpful tip is to be realistic with your trades. A TF2 hat isn’t worth as much as a PS3. You can go ahead and try for it, but you probably won’t be getting an offer on that anytime soon. 

A third tip that I have to offer is to compile your offers in a nice, easy to read list. Under the text box, there is a helpful Reddit tip called Formatting Help. Click on that to open up a little help box full of Reddit formatting goodies. Using these will ensure that your post looks organized and is easy to read. People are more likely to read a list than a giant block of text.


Just a few other quick tips to get you trading your games for ones that you really want:

* Be quick on replies. If someone responds to your post, get back to them as soon as you can. Not only is it polite, but they are more likely to still have their game to trade. Lots of people on r/Gameswap have posts as well, so timeliness is key.

* Pictures are nice, especially for first time trades. Nothing calms a person’s nerves like seeing a picture of the games with the Redditor’s username. While it’s not technically a rule, it does help in the trading process.

* Typically when sending your game away, it’s best to get delivery confirmation on it. This way, you can ease the mind of your trading partner, and you can be sure that it does get delivered. It keeps both sides from getting scammed, so it’s a win-win.

* Communication is key in trading. Keep your trading partner updated. Too lazy to go to the post office today? Let them know. The longer you fail to send the game and fail to communicate to your trading partner, the sketchier it looks. Don’t be lazy though.

* It’s okay to trade for games you weren’t necessarily looking for. I have quite a few games that I never thought I would own, but gave them a shot because I figured I might as well get rid of my old games that weren’t being used. Besides, they might even be fun for you. If they aren’t, well you have one more game you could trade on here!

* Refrain from making posts more than once a week. And even once a week is pushing it. Sift through the new page and see if you can make any trades yourself.


With these tips, you too can be fulfilling all your trades in no time. They are just tips though, not rules, so don't feel like you have to do these things.

[Xbox One IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/06/microsoft-details-xbox-one-used-games-always-online)

&gt;Microsoft says ""your friends and family, your guests and acquaintances get unlimited access to all of your games. Anyone can play your games on your console--regardless of whether you are logged in or their relationship to you."" 
&gt;
The company added that “Xbox One is designed so game publishers **can enable you** to give your disc-based games to your friends. There are no fees charged as part of these transfers. There are two requirements: **you can only give them to people who have been on your friends list for at least 30 days and each game can only be given once.**”

So once you perform the 'mandatory install' of the game on your system, your disk becomes almost worthless.  It can thereafter only be installed one more time and only by someone on your friends list for 30 days.  Also means that someone buying a used game from Gamestop could never swap that game back in, or give it to a friend.  As far as I'm concerned, there will be no Xbox One in my future.  

Here's hoping that Sony has more gamer-centric views when it comes to these things and when it comes to properly owning something when you buy it.

This means that assigning mushrooms has become easier for us and we are willing to do do tiered mushrooms as well. Read below to see how it will work. 

* Tiered mushrooms will go into effect on November 1st.

* To be eligible for the blue mushroom you must complete one confirmed trade. Young accounts may not receive a mushroom promptly to help prevent false trust.

* To be eligible for the red mushroom you must have 10+ confirmed trades, an account at least 6mo old, and at least 200 comment karma or moderator discretion if you do not meet the account age or comment requirement.

* To be eligible for the green mushroom you must have 20+ confirmed trades, an account at least 1 yr old, and at least 400 comment karma or moderator discretion if you do not meet the account age or comment requirement.

* For a confirmed trade to count towards your tiered mushroom goal, the partner must have a 3 mo old account and at least 100 comment karma.

* Diggidy will modify his comment linked in the FAQ to update the new trading sequence. Lower tiered mushroom goes first.

* All successful trades are still posted in the current successful trade list as normal.

* To request your successful mushroom upgrade, make a self-post in r/mushroomkingdom. The title should be format [Your Reddit Account name] - Your number of successful trades. In the text of the post, it should contain links to each of the successful trade confirmation posts. Posts failing to follow these simple instructions will be removed.

* You should wait at least 2 weeks before messaging the moderators about an unfulfilled mushroom request. Requests made before that time will be ignored.

* If for some reason we decide not to upgrade your mushroom, we will comment why in your request submission.

* When we upgrade your mushroom we will notify you in your submission.

* r/mushroomkingdom will be open for meta discussion about r/gameswap as well. FAQ discussions, procedure discussion, etc.

The community is welcome to discuss this here. Let us know what you think. What you like, what you don't like.

Edit: There seems to be some concern that by adding tiered mushrooms we are changing how r/gameswap operates. This is not the case. Business as usual for your trades and how you go about them. The only thing that has changed is that you may be eligible for a different mushroom color to signify you are an active member of this community and reddit in general. Also, it is probably a good indicator that you will not screw someone over.

I agreed to a trade here with a guy with a blue mushroom. I have one too. So we agreed to send our stuff at the same time. I sent my Vita, he didn't cough up his PS3. Then he deletes his reddit account. I had an agreement over messages with him, and proof that I sent, so I decided to call the police.

One problem, I am in the US and he was in Canada. I figured I might as well report it just to cover all my bases. I figured I wouldn't get anything back, but if this guy gets caught, I want it to be because of me.

I told the police the entire story and they put me in contact with a detective. I sent him every message, every picture, every form of contact I had with the scammer. Of course, he sent me his address, so I sent this to the police too. After a long while of back and forth, I had a conversation with this detective. He told me he planned to visit the house and have a talk with the residents.

After this chat, I received messages on reddit from a new account asking me if I had been scammed (We'll call this guy SC). SC tells me that someone he knows has been using his address to scam people on reddit. He also tells me he plans to pay me back in full via PayPal. This was quite a shock to me, so I emailed the detective to see if he could back up the story.

The detective told me that this was true and he was who he said he was. He and a friend had actually planned to scam people. They repped each other with fake trades on their accounts on reddit. After a few more complications, the scammer paid up. I just got my $230 in my PayPal today.

It's taken a while, and it's been quite a journey. However, it's just proven that your $200 system that was stolen over reddit is not always a lost cause to police. If I can do it over an international border, so can you! 

Basically I wanted to share this story to:

* Brag

* And to inform people to **tell the police when you are scammed.** 

Who knows, maybe you'll get retribution like I did.

I know that was a huge read, but I hope it wasn't *that* awful. I really hope this helps someone!

The first thing I would like to state is that this is not meant to scare you this is simply to point out the risks and how to avoid them. I've personally had 4 successful Steam trades with 3 different people in the last month. The risks of doing steam trades comes in three major topics. Not receiving the gift, the opposite party using a stolen credit card or pulling a charge back and Steam account trading.

**You not receiving the gift**

This one is kind of hard to avoid although [Diggidy](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/hl4v4/community_alert_please_suspend_steam_trades_with/c1w95ez) described the best way to perform a trade with out getting screwed on your trade.

* No mushroom with no mushroom - newer redditor goes first.
* One person with mushroom - person without mushroom goes first.
* Two with mushrooms - newer redditor goes first.

You could also organize this by who has the most successful trades possible later if a different mushroom system is in place that allows for this to occur.

**The opposite party using a stolen credit card or pulls a charge back**

This one is the biggest problem out of all three. This is due to the fact that it can get your Steam account banned and will cause many head aches to get it unbanned. I'm going to explain this using Party A and Party B. If Party A gifts a game to Party B using a stolen credit card and the card gets reported or if Party A does a charge back on the purchase both Party A and Party B's account will be banned/suspended. The head aches with this is that Valve will not just simply allow you to pay for the game that gets charged back by the other person. There have been previous issues with this before in the Christmas gift exchange but I'm not going to go into details about that. 

Prevention

There are two ways easy ways to prevent this from happening. The first being that you check the other persons steam account. Some one who has over 10 games is less likely to pull a charge back on you then someone who has just 1-2 games. The other option would be to setup a different Steam account simply for trades. The problem is that while this removes the risk it also increases the chances that someone is less willing to trade with you for the exact reason stated above.

**Steam account trading**

I'm not going to go into to much detail about this aside from just saying don't do it. Theres to much risk for doing this and this is do to the ease for the other person to retrieve their account. If you want to read further details about it I suggest you [look at LiarInGlass'](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/fhfgc/can_we_please_ban_steam_account_trades/) post about steam account trades and the risks associated with them. [Heres](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/fxgbz/attention_all_steam_users/) another great example of the risks associated with trading your steam account.

I am surprised I was able to get a job this fast and I am sure all of your well wishes played a big role in this.  To celebrate, I am trying to do something for a little while that I hope will result in a win-win-win situation.

If you are trying to trade something that is not terribly popular, or you want a game that people just do not seem to have, I may be able to help you.  I plan to outright purchase the game you want as long as it is worth roughly the value of my appraisal of your game(s) (recent sale prices taken into account).  Any games I get by doing this, will be PIF'd shortly thereafter.  Hopefully the way that this is set up, there will be a net positive for PIF.  If not, I am willing to put in $250 towards this project to keep the PIF's going as long as I can.

**P.S.  I have DOTA 2 keys available.**

--------------------

**Why should you do this?**

* You get the game you want, no settling
* No need to post something and wait for replies, I will consider and comment on every offer
* You will be helping games go towards PIF
* You will be helping me celebrate?

After further discussion and consideration of community response, we have decided to reverse the recent decision of prohibiting digital trades. This means that swaps such as Steam Gifts, WoW accounts, etc are now once again fair game in this community. Outright selling is still prohibited as is piracy.

**Moderator Duties**

Moderators are going to take a step back from getting as involved in bad or potentially bad trades. What we may have had a hard time expressing, or you a hard time guessing, is that we love this community like a child. It started out small and needed our direction. However it seems to have reached adolescence. And just needs minimal direction. We are learning to let you have your freedom and entrust more responsibility on your shoulders.

We will still alert you of possible scammers. We will still alert the community of those people that have been banned, and will include the details in r/badkarma as usual. We will now be banning questionable individuals immediately. If you end up following through, then we might get around to unbanning you.

We have provided a list of best practices and expect you to be either smart enough to follow them or deal with the consequences yourself. We cannot control anymore than you can what others do. So we will stop trying.

We will be focusing our efforts instead on r/mushroomkingdom ( a new method for validating trades), sifting through spam filter, and ensuring that the community is focused on what it does best: trading games. Also, more effort will be put it into ensuring that posts at least attempt to conform to the posting method. This vague shit has got to go.

**Community Responsibility**

It will be up to you guys to help each other out in time of needs. That however does not mean posting personal information (Name, address, phone number, etc) in this community. It does mean you can assist new folks joining, pointing out suspicious trades or activity (as some of you already do).

We can't see every post and comment. Neither can you. But together we can keep a pretty good eye on things.

**tl;dr:**

Digital trades are back: steam for steam, game accounts, etc. Yay!!??

Mods are much less likely to assist you in a bad trade. The member in question will be banned, reported to r/badkarma, and the community alerted. Good Luck. We will focus our time on validating successful trades, cleaning up the community from inappropriate posts, etc.

From those two posts ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/14cd79/mod_lets_hear_from_you/) &amp; [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/14q70f/mod_lets_hear_from_you_ver_20_and_a_new_feature/)) we found these topics brought to us by you, the community.

If you disagree with our stance on such issues, please feel free to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23gameswap#/button/c/purple/) and we can have a more personal conversation about the topic. If you have additional topics to discuss with the mod team and community, please address those [here](/1569nz/)

Format:

&gt;Topic

**Response**

###Two weeks ago:

&gt; People posting a link to their own post asking if they see anything the OP likes.

**This has mostly diminished since the first post. While there is no way to make it a requirement, it is common courtesy to make posts and offers as easily understood as possible.** 

&gt;Change the FAQ to say once every 7 days for posting to clear up confusion. 

**Done. Changed in the sidebar.**

&gt;Find way to combat rouge downvoter(s).

**Such is life. Karma means nothing, and we always suggest to browse gameswap while sorted by new, which eliminates the need for votes anyway.**

&gt; Remove the 75 flair tier because OCD.

**We're comfortable with the flair the way we have it now.**

&gt;People not responding to offers make others mad.

**It's listed in the sidebar to ""try and respond to all offers"" but sometimes messages are missed.  Not all unanswered offers are ""No"" so if it's been some time, and the person has been active on reddit, just reply again, or send them a PM.**

&gt;We should lay down the banhammer on more people.

**The ""bannhammer"" is not used as the sole means of maintaining the required format for the subreddit. We typically only ban scammers and blatant trolls.  Bans are issued for assholes and thread-crappers, with or without warning, and are sometimes temporary. Banning first time offenders of the 7 day rule isn't the proper method - we'll stick with our current methods (removal and warning, posting bans.)**

&gt;Swap sniping.

**There will now be a 24 hour rule.  Offers made TO the original poster (OP) will have a 24 hour grace period for OP to respond to the offer. If OP declines, or 24 hours pass, you may make the same/similar offer to the person that OP declined/ignored.  Here are some examples:** 

[This example](http://i.imgur.com/JfVd8.png) is sniping. The first comment is to OP, and is a trade.  In steps the ""sniper"" who isn't OP, and offers to do that trade.  We are not allowing this type of thing to happen anymore, and if you see it happen, please report it.  

[This one](http://i.imgur.com/tvwUs.png) is perfectly fine.  They are the same offer to OP by two different people.  This isn't a snipe.  OP chooses who they want to trade with.  

[Lastly, this one](http://i.imgur.com/dqm4o.png) is no longer considered a ""snipe.""  The comment was made to OP, 24 hours have passed without response. At this point, OP has ""ignored"" the first offer, so anyone is free to look into that trade if they want. Additionally, if OP declines the offer, anyone is free to seek out the trade.  

OP has a ""home field advantage"" for 24 hours.  If you see someone offer a trade that you're willing to do, look for their post and offer it there - not on someone else's post.  


&gt;Actually enforce the rules.

**The moderators do as much as we can with the time we have for the subreddit, but we do not, and can not, vet every comment/post. That is why we have the report button.  If you see blatant rule breaking, use the report button and then message the mods.**

&gt;Get more mods.

**See below.**

&gt;Use middlemen to ship the games.

**We do not, and will not offer a 'middleman' service under any circumstances.  If you find an agreement within the community organically, that's your own doing. We support and believe in the flair system we have implemented, but we still encourage traders to vet their trading partners.**

&gt;Video game **services** (modding) for games?

**At this time, we will not approve of this method for swapping.**


&gt;Make flair mobile app friendly.

**This is a work in progress.  It's likely this will not be implemented until after the upcoming holiday(s). \_deffer_ is working on it, but it will not be 100% compatible with all apps across all devices.**

###Last week:

&gt;over in steamgameswap, they have the option to close a thread when the trade is done. is that something we could consider? just so that people aren't offering on a 5 month old thread.

**After discussing it, we've decided not to implement a similar system.  A better solution (which is easier for everyone because it doesn't involve css) would be for users to edit their posts, remove the entire post body, and just mention that your thread is outdated, and provide a link to either your new*****er*** **thread, or provide a link to your submission page.**


&gt;Swap sniping: how do we want to define this. if someone has 150 comments on a thread, am I supposed to read all of them before making an offer? i may not mean to snipe, but it may look like it because i refuse to read a ton of comments just to make sure i didn't make a better offer than someone else.

**Defined above. You are not ""sniping"" if you offer the same trade as someone else.**

&gt;This might be too cumbersome to implement but maybe we could have a button we click within each thread (like one of those sidebar buttons) that basically runs the OPs username through /r/badkarma and returns the search results. Basically, it would make back checking a user so easy, that people would have no excuse not to. Y'know what I'm sayin?

**This is too cumbersome to implement.  It's on the user to vet their trade partner, which includes doing any research into their prior trading history on their own.  If it were easy to implement a system that vetted a trade partner, we would offer it to you in a heartbeat.  That said - we have a button in the sidebar for /r/badkarma - it's in your best interest to check it every now and then, especially if you disregard our warnings and accept deals via PM.  See, banned users can still browse gameswap, they just can't reply - meaning if they see your post, they can PM you an ""offer"" and that's where the trouble might begin.**

&gt;Also, we ought to do a bit of advertising/recruitment to get some new blood in here for swapping. Seems like most people have a lot already.

**This is in the works.  We've hit a few subreddits in the past with varying success, and will likely do so again soon - probably after the Christmas holiday to take advantage of people who have ""new &amp; shiny"" and want to get rid of some of their ""old &amp; dusty"" stuff. There ~~will be~~ [is a comment below](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/156cu6/mod_head_inside_for_a_chat_new_rule_new_mods/c7job5m) for your suggestions on what subreddits to post to.**

&gt;Image tags.

**There is no update from last week. \_deffer_ is working on them, and just needs time. A suggestion was made to change the tag for /xbox360 to just /360, and that will be implemented unless an overwhelming majority disapprove of it (comment below if so.)**

_____________________________________________

That's it for the suggested items from the two posts - one new rule (24 hour wait time) and a couple ""common courtesy"" suggestions. Again, we want to hear from the community about improvements and concerns you may have about gameswap.  We have a suggestion thread [here](/1569nz/) which is always linked in the sidebar. 

_____________________________________________

In addition to all of the above, we want to introduce /u/patdap and /u/VampHuntD to our mod team. Their addition will hopefully allow us to respond to messages faster, clean out spam more frequently and have extra eyes looking for things that shouldn't be here. 

_______________________________
_______________________________
Lastly, the one overarching rule that trumps everything else, and which you should live by on reddit and beyond:

This is because they do not follow our very simple submission rules. These rules are so it will make for easy browsing of the community. So, even though it is on the sidebar, and in the FAQ, and something most people are doing AND even on the submission page, I thought I could spell it out here. 

When you make a submission you need to include at the very least the name of the games you want (or simply offers) AND the system it is for. Don't assume that just because it is only available on one system that someone else knows. 

So I'm going to list some examples of good posts and bad posts. 

First the bad for those of you with a short attention spam:

[H]Game [W]Game

[H]Game [System] [W] Game

[H]Game [W] Game [System]

As you can see in the above our friend was not specific about they system types the games are for during the entire title. 

Still with us? I hope so.

Good:

[H] Game [System] [W] Game [System]

If you have a homogenous post appending the system type to the front of the post will work:

[System] [H] Game [W] Game

So I hope this clears everything up. So before you ask why is your post stuck in the spam filter, check the submission title. 90% of the time that is the reason. 

Edit:

And please, help us moderate this. If you see a re-post that occurred to soon report it. If you see a vague or inappropriate submission report it.  This really helps us from missing things.

______________________

To the title:  We are instituting a rule **against** using ""If OP declines, I'll do this"" as an acceptable comment to someone who offered to OP. OP has a ""homefield"" advantage in their post, and they shouldn't have to deal with competition in their own post.  

An example: I'm OP, and shoot2scre offers me his Tomb Raider, for my Crysis 3.  I haven't responded yet, and you think that's a deal you'd like to do.  ***Don't comment to shoot2score in my post!***  If you like that deal, and want to see if shoot would do it with you, go find ***his post*** and offer it there. The OP has right of first refusal in their own post. OP should be the only person responding to offers made in their post.  Don't be so lazy that you're making offers in other people's posts - do some digging and find the appropriate post to make the offer.

The only time you can offer to shoot2scre would be if I *neglected* his offer for 24 hours or if I *declined* his offer - then it's fair game.

We have been getting complaints lately about users who are taking it upon themselves and getting in the middle of two other users trades to tell them that it is uneven or unfair for one of the parties. 

It is not your responsibility to tell someone they are getting an unfair trade. It may seem unfair to you but it may not be unfair to the person accepting it. 

Not everything in here is about the monetary value of a game. If I want to trade Mass effect 3 for Final Fantasy XIII when I've already beaten Mass Effect 3 and really really really want to play Final Fantasy XIII, that's my business and I would be annoyed by anyone telling me that I am being swindled. 

It is a users own responsibility to not get swindled in here. Not yours. 

**If you think someone is getting an unfair deal, and only if you feel like it is worth saying something, MESSAGE THE MODS and we will take care of it *if* we see it necessary.** 

No trade is unfair if both sides are getting what they want. 

If there are problems with my assessment here, make a post and sound off about it and we can probably come to a better agreement.

If anyone is against this judgement, just reply in here to be heard and if there are enough reply's, I will take the course already mentioned and give them a warning. 

Once again, if there are any problems with this, just post here and make your case for or against it so we may be able to do something most people will be happy with.

Hopefully this will be of use to swappers who aren't used to shipping packages and are maybe not sure about how best to ship video games. I am from Canada, so if someone knows more accurate information, particularly about shipping within/from the US, please let me know.

**How do I pack a video game for shipment?** A [#0 bubble mailer](http://www.amazon.com/POLY-BUBBLE-MAILER-PADDED-ENVELOPES-100ct/dp/B001G6U7FA) (sometimes called a ""#DVD bubble mailer""). They will be sold by your local post office in both the US and Canada, and they should cost about $1 each. If you expect to do a lot of trades, you can buy in bulk and save money. Amazon (link above) sells 100 for $25. You can also get good deals from [ebay](http://shop.ebay.ca/?_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&amp;_nkw=%230+mailers&amp;_sacat=See-All-Categories) and [Sam's Club](http://www.samsclub.com/sams/shop/product.jsp?productId=190386).

**How big/heavy is a game?** A typical disc-based console game (e.g., PS3/XBox/Wii, but not oversized PC box games), when packed in a mailer, has dimensions about 6"" x 9"" x 0.5"" and weighs about 120 - 200 grams (4 - 7 ounces).

**How much does it cost to ship...** (all of the following prices are before taxes and assuming we're cheap and we want the cheapest shipping methods available)

**...within the US?** [About $1.75 - $2.25](http://www.usps.com/prices/first-class-mail-prices.htm) via USPS First-Class Mail (see the ""Packages"" table). Delivery confirmation is an additional [$0.70](http://www.usps.com/prices/extra-services-prices.htm).

**...from the US to Canada?** [About $2.00 - $2.75](http://www.usps.com/prices/first-class-mail-international-prices.htm) via USPS First-Class Mail International (see the ""Packages"" table, Country Price Group 1). Delivery confirmation will push the price above $8.

**...within Canada?** [$2.06](http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/ratesprices/postalprices2011.jsf) via CanadaPost. Delivery confirmation will push the price above $8.

**...from Canada to the US?** [$3.60](http://www.canadapost.ca/cpo/mc/personal/ratesprices/postalprices2011.jsf) via CanadaPost. Delivery confirmation will push the price above $8.

**What about shipping via someone other than USPS?** Generally services like FedEx and UPS will be significantly more expensive to ship something as small as a video game with (think $8 or more), especially if shipping across a border. However, it may be worth it if you are shipping 2 or more games to the same address. If you are shipping across a border, **please** check with the person you are shipping to before shipping with a service like FedEx or UPS, as they often charge an exorbitant amount upon delivery for duty (I've been charged $20 duty at the door for a game that sells used for $15).",,False,,t5_2rbm7,True,,,True,t3_f66pj,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/f66pj/the_complete_guide_to_shipping/,

If there are any tags that just don't make sense - say the majority wants gamecube shortened to gc, or you want to keep the 360 one as xbox360, then have that conversation in the comments.

* Posts with the word Steam in the title will now be orangered.
* Posts without the word Steam in the title will be blue.

* One confirmed trade: Blue mushroom
* Ten confirmed trades: Red mushroom
* Twenty confirmed trades: Green mushroom

We have tentatively added 3 additional pieces of flair.  I will tag 2 throwaways with the other new pieces and comment in the comments for you to see them. One, as you might have noticed, is next to my username (for now.)

What we're looking for is feedback from the community here.  Do you have any better feasable suggestions?  The images should be fairly simple (**read: looks good at ~20 x 20 pixels**) and easily recognizable.  Do you have a specific order you would like them ""unlocked"" in? Not everyone is going to agree, but if the majority wants a certain order, we'll see what we can come up with. 

Ultimately, the final decisions will be on the mods, but don't think that we won't take every ounce of feedback from the community into consideration.

As most of you know, we really advise against making/taking offers via PM. This is for a number of reasons:

 Our biggest concern is that someone who is banned in the subreddit can still PM whoever he/she wants. This person will be out to scam you. Never be afraid to tell someone that you'll only deal with them if they are willing to make the offer on your post. If you don't have one, either make one or tell them to make one. A lot of times, these offers will seem too good to be true. If they are, it probably is and you may end up disappointed. 

There are links on the sidebar for both /r/badkarma and the [Shared Ban List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AiFZyanaAvZDdHdyS0dQMnRSY01HVWYzSldTaGowbXc&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html#/button/c/orange/p/right/). Those things are in place to protect you. Whereas we won't tell you exactly why someone was banned, understand that it requires a very serious offense and we felt that the person was no longer a good fit on our awesome little subreddit.

It is also virtually impossible for us to moderate what goes on in PMs. You can send all the screenshots you want to the mods, but the only system we can truly trust is the one that is in public view. If someone scams you out of your game through only PM interaction, there isn't anything we can do since it didn't involve /r/gameswap.

 **No matter who it is, no matter who they tell you they are or how many trades they have, you have to understand that there is a very specific reason why they didn't make you an offer on your thread.**


---


Deleting threads is another issue. 

**You should never delete your threads**. 

If there is a format problem, we will remove it and instruct you to re-post. No harm, no foul. 

Also, **users should not be moderating other users!** This includes posting messages about bad formatting in someone elses thread. If you think the user has an improperly formed thread, report it and message us. We'll handle it. If a user messages you, or PMs you 'impersonating' (or acting like) a mod... please let us know.

---

The FAQ talks about a recommended shipping order. The mods feel as though things work out easier and safer for all if you follow it. 

Please notice that it is *recommended*. Once a pair of swappers moves to PM for information exchange, final details, or whatever, you guys work out whatever shipping order makes everyone comfortable. If you have a mushroom and the other person does not, there should be absolutely no reason for you to be shipping first. If the other person isn't willing, its probably best to walk away. You may lose out on a trade, but you drastically reduce the chances of you getting ripped off. 

---

I'd also like to talk about shipping etiquette. Please make sure whatever you are shipping is adequately protected. Box, padded mailer, bubble envelope, something along those lines is fine. Priority mail envelopes, basic paper envelopes, things with no built in protection are probably a bad idea.

 We can't dictate what you use to ship your items, and not everyone can afford elaborate shipping supplies. But padded mailers are 2 for $1 at Dollar Tree, Priority mail flat rate boxes are free, and crumpled up newspaper(or bubble wrap) adds very little to the weight of a package. Before sending it out, maybe ask yourself 'Would I be happy if a package like this showed up at my house?' If you answered no, try something else. 

Also, please always use delivery confirmation. If you use Paypal/stamps.com to print your labels, its free. If you buy it at the post office, its less than a buck. Without delivery confirmation, you cannot prove that you shipped anything. I don't know about any of you, but I know that I feel a lot safer being able to watch a package travel across country vs sending it out and hoping that my partner eventually gets it.

---

Buying/Selling: **If we see Paypal/Money in your title, your post is coming down and we will ask that you resubmit it without the reference.** If you want to buy or sell something, put it in /r/gamesell. If you make a /r/gamesell thread and link to it from your /r/gameswap thread, we have no problems with that. Also, if Paypal comes up naturally through negotiations, that's okay too. **Under no circumstances should you be requesting Paypal here in your top post.**

---

Last thing is a new one for us moderators here... recently we were messaged about a throwaway/troll account that apparently will message your trade partner or you (or sometimes both) telling you not to go through with a trade after you agree to a swap in a public thread. This troll will tell you that the person you are swapping with is a scammer, has ripped people off, sent people viruses, etc. If this happens to you, please let the mods know. We have been doing some sleuthing and we think we know who it is. We'd like you guys to message us if this happens to you

Forza 4 released in 2011 and contained two discs - the play disc, and the download disc with over 200 additional cars.

The Forza that comes with the Holiday Bundle 360s is the ""Essentials Edition"" which **does not** come with disc 2, meaning that those 200 cars are **not** included with that version of the game.  You can get these games via the XBL Marketplace, but you'll pay extra for them.   

This same example applies to GOTY games.  If you have a GOTY game, that includes DLC **on disc**, please label it as such.  If it's a GOTY version, but the DLC was code based, and is **not included** we should be helping each other out by labeling them as such.

It's a pretty cool feat having this many redditors subscribed to our sub. Here's hoping we make it to 20,000 and beyond.  

On the matter at hand... we have begun discussing the use of Google Documents here and the seemingly negative impact they've had.  We wanted to get the communities input before making any decisions.  We've begun discussing ways to address the problems with the influx of Google Doc posts.  

The following are just some of the issues we've discussed:

1.  Google Docs break up the continuity of the subreddit, making you navigate away from reddit to just browse a list.

2.  Google Docs completely break the search function which is incredibly useful here if you're looking for a specific game.  

3. Google Docs clutter up your Google Drive, burying what are otherwise important personal documents.  

4. A lot of people are unable to view Google Docs from work or school and thus miss out completely on your trade posts.

5. Some people will skip over Google Doc threads entirely meaning that the posters are missing out on potential swaps.

The biggest issue here for me is that they completely break the search function.  I think that's a huge problems and something that has led to some frustration on my part since it was something I used to utilize regularly.  

We haven't made any decisions and have discussed alternatives to outright banning Google Docs; such as, requiring a full text list when you create a new thread.  Ultimately we want to know how the community feels about the topic before we make any decisions.

1365284892.0,25,self.gameswap,1btgf7,[PSA] Regarding Shipping/Packaging Securely and Safely. Also a Shipping Guideline,Luclicane,29,4,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1btgf7/psa_regarding_shippingpackaging_securely_and/,"With a lot of new members joining this community, a lot of them dont understand the horrors of USPS shipping. Many might not properly package consoles and games resulting in damaged goods and trades gone bad. I decided we needed a Guide of sorts to help out all the newbies.

**First off, a Warning about USPS;** They DO NOT care about anyone's packages, fragile or not, box or padded envelope, they will treat your package like dirt. Expect this. Expect nothing else. The only reason we use them and suggest using them is... it's cheap. This is why we need to ensure that we package our goods properly. 

**Second**, When writing your trade partners information on the package, **Double and Triple Check ALL of the information** The post office doesn't know intuitively where your package is going. You must make sure you write the address and zip code **LEGIBLY**. If they cant read it, that package probably wont end up at your Trade Partners Residence. Resulting in a bad trade. 

**THIS IS HOW I RECOMMEND YOU PACKAGE YOUR TRADES**;



**NEVER SHIP IN A MANILLA ENVELOPE, OR ANYTHING ELSE WITH NO PROTECTION. YOU WILL BE FLAMED FOR ALL ETERNITY!!!**



**When shipping Games with Plastic Cases**

* Use a bubble mailer, in a standard 6X9 envelope you can fit one game (PS2, PS3, Xbox, 360, Wii, etc.) securely inside. Its a tight fit but thats good. Unless someone starts jumping all over your package, it will arrive safely, even if they decide to throw it against a wall. You can buy bubble mailers relatively cheaply (I get mine from a dollar store, 2 for $1) just look around you. For multiple games consider using either a box with lots of bubble wrap or a foamy type substance inside to keep it from moving around (The tighter the package is inside, the better), or a bigger bubble mailer. With a bigger bubble mailer, the games may be able to move around so add some filler to make it tighter. Paper is also a good filler however it is NOT a substitute for bubble wrap or padding.

**When Shipping PS1, Sega CD, Dreamcast games**

* These cases are actually really fragile. The Plastic doesn't allow any give so they crack much easier. For these I would recommend you box it up and wrap it with bubble wrap a few times. Once again add paper, bubble wrap, or other padding to make it as tight as possible. 

**When Shipping Loose Discs**

* Please dont ship just a disc in a Bubble Mailer or a Box. Either put it in a jewel case (standard CD case) and follow the shipping guide above, or if you MUST, Bubble wrap the crap out of the disc and send it in a box. 

**When Shipping actual Boxed games** (GBA/C, SNES, N64, ETC)

* These do NOT belong anywhere near a Bubble Mailer. The box will easily get squished in the shipping process. To avoid this, send these games in a box, with the usual padding and bubble wrapping to insure they do not get damaged. Make sure the filler is tight but not too tight in that it squishes the flimsy box. Remember, We want it to be as secure as possible without damaging the goods inside.

**When Shipping Loose Carts** 

* Follow the above guidelines for shipping boxed games. Except tighter.

**When Shipping Systems**

* These are the most fragile out of everything we are shipping. We need to take the most care in shipping any and all Gaming Systems. Bubble Wrap the Hell out of the system, use Paper or Styrofoam filler (all 6 sides people) and Box that baby up. After boxing it, you should be able to shake the box pretty hard and not hear much moving. This is for the obvious reasons; Its a machine, it has a lot of parts (some of which are moving), all of which are extremely fragile.

**PROTIPS** 

* To cut down on shipping costs, save all the bubble wrap and packaging you receive in trades. Even save the bubble mailers, since they can be used as cushioning too.

* Best thing you can do, Copy + Paste your Trade Partner's information into wordpad or notepad and print it out. Then just tape it to the package. Very Easily done, and saves a lot of possible problems/mistakes.

* Dont forget the Return Address!!

* For cheapest possible shipping use Paypal! www.paypal.com/shipnow lets you create shipping labels that you just tape onto the package. A standard CiB (Complete in Box) Current Gen game is around 5 or 6 oz. This makes the shipping cost around $2 and thats with Tracking!

* Take PICTURES! Are you shipping something out? Take pictures that show how its packaged, or receipts, anything! Keep it for yourself in case a dispute arises. Receive a damaged good? Take Pictures of how it arrived before opening it!

* Want a large amount of cheap (big ones you can fit 2 games in) bubble mailers? http://amzn.com/B000GHXWUC 100 Mailers for $20. 




Thanks For Reading This Towering Wall of Text. I hope you learned something. Remember, Package your trade like you were sending it to yourself. You want it to get to your Trade Partner as safely and as securely as possible.

**HAPPY SWAPPING**

* Do not repost your threads more than once a week.

Remember you can't change the title when you edit... so if that's the kind of thing that will bother you, use a general title (H - 10 PS3, 15 Xbox 360 games W - Gears of War 3, Dark Souls, etc) when you create your thread.  

I normally put the specific games I have for trade in my titles... but I'm not terribly OCD about editing it when I inevitably make a swap.

1. When you open the app, you will be able to list all of your games for consoles. you can list your entire library or just the ones you are willing to trade

2. After you list your games, you will then be able to list games you want. Add as many games as you want here, the more the better. If you list a game that one of your facebook friends have, it will show you who has it.

3. See what games your friends have and request a trade. Anyone of your facebook friends that are using Game Trade will show up here and their games will be shown to you. It will also indicate if they have a game that you want.


So, thats about it right now. Its pretty basic but it works. This is why I need some testers to offer suggestions, bugs, features, anything!

The first one has been in the same facility for the last 7 days being processed every day without leaving. The second one got to my shipping post office, put on a truck and disappeared 5 days ago. 

Now I am not saying that the guys who sent these packages didn't put the addresses on their properly. There could be a number of reasons that this could happen. The address issue being the most common however is the reason I am ""addressing"" it :D

* First off, if you ship packages using shipping labels and stickers, it helps if you tape over them with packaging tape. You don't want that sticker being ripped off of your package while in transit. 

* If you are going to send two bubble envelopes to the same address and you tape them together to save on shipping, **always** put the
return address on **both** envelopes as they could easily become separated once in the mail. The one that doesn't have postage will be sent back to you. 

* Make it difficult for a corrupt mailman to get into your boxed packages. If you reuse a box, make sure the edges are taped fairly well. This won't detour someone with a box knife but if they were to just pry the package open, they may be discouraged if it is all taped up with packaging tape. 

* Post office sorting facilities use machines to sort your packages and machines don't take in consideration of the value of your product. Always make sure you secure your games or whatever you are shipping. There have been many times here where a persons package has come back with a broken case or disc. Once someone package had a hole punched clean through the case. 

* With all that said, the moderators can not do anything about the post office screwing up your packages. All we can tell you to do is to contact your post office and try to see what they have to say about it and to work it out with your partner. 

My way of dealing with a package not arriving, once I am resolved that the package isn't getting to me, I just forget about it and move on to the next trade. Shit happens. There's nothing I can do about it. I am not saying that is what you have to do. I am just stating that I see it as the best course of action.

1355325015.0,23,self.gameswap,14q70f,[MOD] Let's hear from you (ver. 2.0) and a new feature we're working on. ,_deffer_,24,1,146,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/14q70f/mod_lets_hear_from_you_ver_20_and_a_new_feature/,"So, it's been about a [week since we asked to hear from the community](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/14cd79/mod_lets_hear_from_you/) regarding any topics you wanted to discuss. To maximize visibility with more people in the community, we're going to have discussions again for around a week.  After that, we'll have another mod post, and give our thoughts and introduce any changes to the rules/FAQ. 
_________________________________________
_________________________________________
Highlights from the last post that we've been discussing so far:  (Note - discussing =/= implementing.)

* People posting a link to their own post asking if they see anything the OP likes. 

* Change the FAQ to say once every 7 days for posting to clear up confusion. (**Done already. ----&gt;**)

* Find way to combat rouge downvoter(s).

* Remove the 75 flair tier because OCD.

* People not responding to offers make others mad.

* We should lay down the banhammer on more people.

* Swap sniping. 

* Actually enforce the rules.

* Get more mods.

* Use middlemen to ship the games. 

* Video game services (modding) for games?

* Make flair mobile app friendly (**Working on it**)

###If you see anything missing from the first conversation, please comment and not that.  We picked most of the major issues we saw, but if we missed one, please let us know. 

____________________________________________
____________________________________________

Same guidelines as last time:

###Things to talk about:

* Things we can improve about the subreddit.

* Things you would change about the subreddit.

* Things you ***like*** about the subreddit.

* Things you ***don't like*** about the subreddit.

* Rule changes you'd like to see.\*

* General ideas to improve the swapping process.

* ***Anything else you can think of that's relevant.***

Lastly - A new feature that I implemented after copying other subreddits - images. In comments and in posts. **This is in no way mandatory**, and I'd like to hear from the mobile users if it works for them at all... Just a fun little thing I've done. 


My favorite, is the ""confirmed"" image.  On the successful trade thread, if you type `[](/confirmed)`, it'll show up as an image like this: [](/confirmed).  Now, it is case sensitive, but I've put it in to recognize both ""confirmed"" and ""Confirmed.""  Any variation other than those two will not show up.  

The next are more tedious, and will likely come with other suggestions to implement them.  I'll do what I can, but I'm a busy person, so the timetable isn't likely in your favor. If you want to help me out, I'll need images (preferrably .png file type) that are ""clean"" - no background stuff. Yes, I favored the ""new"" consoles over retro - I have plans to implement them as well, just need the images and more time. 

What to type | What it looks like
:-|-:
`[](/wii)` | [](/wii)
`[](/wiiu)` | [](/wiiu)
`[](/xbox)` | [](/xbox)
`[](/xbox360)` | [](/xbox360)
`[](/ps2)` | [](/ps2)
`[](/ps3)` | [](/ps3)
`[](/psp)` | [](/psp)
`[](/vita)` | [](/vita)
`[](/3ds)` | [](/3ds)
`[](/ds)` | [](/ds)
`[](/steam)` | [](/steam)
`[](/dreamcast)` | [](/dreamcast)

These are ***case sensitive***.  I'll work on implementing them in uppercase and first letter capped, but that requires more time than I have available right now. Please use [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/14q70f/mod_lets_hear_from_you_ver_20_and_a_new_feature/c7fee1r) comment to try out the images so we don't flood the post with images and bury the more important stuff.

We believe that this change will make the community more easy to browse on all devices and increase the usefulness of the search function. 

**Effective Sept 3rd, your submission must include a text list of the games you have. There are no requirements for tables, or the formatting of your list.** However, there is a helpful guide [here](http://reddittext.com/) if you are concerned about aesthetics.

**If you have more than *50* games in your list of haves, you do not have to list them all, but you do have to list at least 20 of them. It would be in your best interest to list the games that you believe people are the most after. As always moderators reserve the ability to approve or remove a post as we see fit.** It's also not a bad idea to list some of your wants

**You can include a google doc regardless of the number of games you have to offer. Only a text list is required**

If this is an inconvenience for some of you, we're terribly sorry, but this discussion is closed for the time being. It is our belief this is for the best. 

Also, remember that your submission title should still include the appropriate platform your games are available for in the Haves section of the title. Same for the wants, even if it is simply 'Offers'. For Example: 

**[Country][H]List inside [System1, System2, etc] || [W] Offers [System1, System2, etc].**

No one wants to waste time making an offer of a PS3 game if you're not interested in PS3 games. Also, it is always a good idea to include a few game titles in your submission title to draw interest to the thread.

1324412161.0,25,self.gameswap,nk9i2,A message from the Mods: The Spam Filter and You,kaintehdragoon,27,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/nk9i2/a_message_from_the_mods_the_spam_filter_and_you/,"Hello denizens of [/r/gameswap](/r/gameswap). Lately there have been a lot of messages to the moderators concerning filtered posts and whatnot. Today, I'm going to take some time to explain the spam filter to everyone, as well as proper etiquette for requesting that your post gets saved.

Ideally everyone would read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq/) so that this wouldn't be an issue, but hey I realize that it's a giant wall of text and you can't be bothered to read it because you have busy lives trading and redditing and whatever it is that kids do these days.

**HOW TO PISS OFF THE SPAM FILTER:** 

1) Submit a post, delete said post, submit new post, delete that post, repeat to infinity. This will really make the spam filter mad because it will think you are spamming your submissions and it will filter you out.

2) Improperly format your submissions. Over the course of its lifetime, the spam filter has gained preferences on what to accept. It learns by what has been approved or filtered in the past. We moderators have been trying to train it for ages now, but it doesn't always work.

**HOW TO GET YOUR POST SAVED FROM THE FILTER:**

If your post has been eaten by the spam filter, send a message to the moderators. Please do not resubmit your post over and over again because this will further enrage the spam filter and increase the odds that it will never let you through again.

***EDIT:*** If you did everything correctly and still got filtered, you are fine. You didn't do anything wrong. Relax. You just got filtered. Not the end of the world. Message the mods and we'll take care of it.

When you message the moderators, please include a link to your submission. It makes our lives a lot easier, and we'll get the job done a lot faster (if your post meets the proper criteria -- formatting). 

Also, please be polite. We're volunteers and honestly when people are demanding or a prick it sucks. I'm not saying you should grovel at our feet (although that would be cool), but don't message us saying ""Your spam filter sucks. It filtered my post. Do something about it."" I'll help you, but I won't like it. And I'll tag you on my RES saying that you're a jerk (this is true). 

So help us by using proper submitting techniques (H/W, platform, titles) so we can educate the spam filter so it will eat less posts.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

tl;dr - if your post isn't showing up, it got filtered. *Politely* message the mods and we will save your post for you. Do not resubmit.",,False,,t5_2rbm7,True,,oredshroom,True,t3_nk9i2,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/nk9i2/a_message_from_the_mods_the_spam_filter_and_you/,moderator

When trading, please remember to take all possible precautions to help avoid nasty situations. Delivery confirmation (*very* useful), photos of games, and, if you think it will be needed, a back-up method of communication are all good steps toward a safe and successful swap. 

Communication is the real issue here.  Make sure you inform your trade partner of any shipping delays or problems so that there are no misunderstandings! Stay in frequent, friendly contact until the transaction is complete.

Since none of us are proficient at CSS, we had to rely on trickery to do something instead of changing up the look of the place. So to be clear, we will not be going private. I know I can safely speak for all of the mods when I say that we love this place and what it does and we would NEVER make you guys pay to use r/gameswap. 

Secondly, I would like to apologize for [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/rnsjm/modmsg_effective_monday_rgameswap_is_going/c47amo0) I made on the post yesterday. I do not think of you guys as 'casuals' or anything like that. I ~~love~~ like all of you no matter what color your mushroom is or how long you have been here. 

Thirdly, I have a few reminders:

* Remember to put your country code in the title. If you don't, your post will be removed. 

* Only one post a week. If you are caught removing an old post and then creating new posts, you will be warned. If you choose to ignore our warning you will be banned for a period of time. 

* [/r/SteamGameSwap](/r/SteamGameSwap) updated their rules so that they allow most all digital for digital trades. If you have a digital for digital trade please go there. We will no longer be allowing any pure digital trades. If you have a digital for physical (this includes MS points, Riot points, etc) that is okay, but please remember to put a country code (even if it is digital for an MS point card, I know you can just read the other person your numbers, but just do it so we can have some uniformity).

* Remember to post your successful trades in the [successful trade thread!](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/qafgp/successful_trade_list_for_march_and_onward/) This one almost has 500 posts, so we'll be creating a new one soon, but in the mean time continue to post there. Please wait a week before messaging the mods about not getting your mushroom. I usually stop by the thread every two or three days.

* If you have 10 or 20 successful trades, stop over to [/r/mushroomkingdom](/r/mushroomkingdom) and request your red or green mushroom (you have to link to each successful trade confirmation).

* If your post isn't showing up in the new posts list, it was probably eaten by the spam filter. DO NOT repost your thread over and over hoping it will get through. This will just anger the filter and make it hate you (most likely forever). DO message the mods with a link to your submission and we'll take it from there. If your post is properly formatted, we'll approve it. If not, we will tell you what to fix and ask you to resubmit your post. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask in this thread or you can message the mods if you don't want to ask here!

1) Trades sometimes go bad.  We like to have a record of what went wrong.

2) People use the search bar from time to time to find game offers/requests.

3) Other people may arrange trades within your threads.  This may be of questionable etiquette, but it happens nonetheless.

4) **The more you delete your posts, the more the spam filter hates you and eats them.**

Those reposters who delete threads to somehow to mask that they are reposting within a week are just showing their guilty mind.

**We are going to start handing out temporary bans to those choose to ignore this message (and possibly permabans for the more egregious cases).**  I handed my first out just a few minutes ago.

On an unrelated note, please **post what country you are from** in the beginning of your thread.  We've had a lot of users post threads containing region specific games lately and it's annoying to find out that a potential trade cannot be done because of a region lock.

**CHEAP PACKAGING &amp; SHIPPING GUIDE**

----

**How do I pack a video game for shipment?** 

[Some type of protected/bubble mailer](http://www.amazon.com/POLY-BUBBLE-MAILER-PADDED-ENVELOPES-100ct/dp/B001G6U7FA) should ALWAYS be used.  They will be sold at your local post office/Walmart/drug store/etc and should cost about $1 each.  If you expect to do a lot of trades, you can buy in bulk from Amazon or Ebay to save money.  Additionally, if you're careful about how you open them, you can save and re-use the bubble mailers you get from other swappers here!


**How Should I Ship My Games?**

The best way to ship games, is by using PayPal.  If you don't have an account you can sign up for one. This allows you to print shipping labels at home (tracking included) and it's usually about $1 cheaper than going to the post office.  The best part is that if your package weighs less than 13 ounces, you can drop it in any of the blue drop-off boxes at any post office.

**First:**

Log in with Paypal. 

**Second:** 

[Access the PayPal Shipping Form by Clicking Here.](https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_ship-now)   

**Address Information:** 

Enter your address as the return address (if it is not already filled in), and enter the recipient's address on the right.  Make sure that everything is filled out correctly.

**Shipment Information:** 

Select ""U.S. Postal Service"" as your carrier.  Select ""First-Class Mail Parcel (2-5 days)"" as the service type, and ""Packaging/Thick Envelope"" as the package size.

**Weight:** 

Most Xbox 360 and PS3 games typically weigh around 3 ounces.  Games with added packaging and extra discs will typically weigh more.  To get an accurate weight of a game, check out a game retailer's website (such as Amazon) and look under ""Product Details.""  (For example, after searching for L.A. Noire at Amazon, under its product details it states that the game weighs 5.6 ounces.  Round the game up to 6 ounces to compensate for the packaging in which you are shipping the game in.)

**Shipment Options:** 

Delivery confirmation is included in the price of using First-Class Mail.  You should not use the signature required option unless you're sending something really expensive and have discussed that with your partner before hand.  Certified or other forms or tracking are more expensive and not necessary.  

**Payment:** 

The cost of shipping one game should be less than $2.  The funds will be withdrawn from your PayPal account balance, a credit card, or the bank account to which the account was registered.  Once you pay, can print the label.

----

**ETIQUETTE REMINDERS**

----

**Game Condition:**

When you list your games - you should also include ACCURATE descriptions of them. If they are not NEW or LIKE NEW, you should explain why!  Are there pre-owned stickers on it?!  Sticker residue? Ripped plastic? Game art missing?  Scratches on the disk?  

Are you a smoker?  Do you smoke inside your home?  It's likely your games smell nice an ash-tray.  You should probably disclose those kind of things.  Anything that you wouldn't expect from a game that was purchased at a store... should be disclosed. 

Don't put yourself in the position of having to explain why you neglected to mention those things BEFORE swapping.  DISCLOSE... DISCLOSE... DISCLOSE!


**Thread-Crapping:**

This is a simple rule... if you're not a party to the swap, don't comment on it.  Period.  

A swap is between the person making the offer and the OP.  

Any comments about the relative fairness, or comments aimed at 'stirring the pot' or causing trouble or starting arguments will be deemed thread-crapping.  

If you think someone is trying to take advantage of a new user, or bully someone into making a swap, or REALLY getting taken advantage of on value... PLEASE message the mods.  Do not post in public.  Do not call the user out.  Do not try to be a white knight.  You're only going to end up getting banned.

Please respond to that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1g76x8/mod_suggestion_thread_follow_up_post/cahfiy9)

-+-+

First. We've compiled a few 'tips' for people that may help their experience on gameswap:
    
* Get Reddit Enhancement Suite ([RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com)).  It's so worth the purchase cost (8 easy installments of $0.00) and makes it so much easier when editing, copying, tagging users etc.

* There is a shortcut bar (top of page) that you can add gameswap to if you want. If you look under the user bar on the right side of you page, there's a section that looks like [this](http://imgur.com/RgMDXMC). Just click on the `+shortcut` button, and it will add /r/gameswap.  To add gameswap, but default it to sort by new, find the gameswap button in the shortcut bar, and double click. Then, in the entry fields, where it says `subreddit:gameswap` change gameswap to `gameswap/new/` and save. Then, every time you click the button, you'll go to gameswap sorted by new.


* Reddit is great in that you can create your own community almost at will. You can use this to your advantage by creating your own space to keep track of trades. For example, [here](/r/deffer_trades) is mine - it's usually private, but I've opened it up as restricted for a bit so you can see an example. I put my trade partner and the swap in the title, link to the trade negotiations in the post body, and then the permalink of our private messages as the first comment (don't worry - other people can't open your PMs). That way I have everything in one spot for every trade, and it also makes confirming those trades easy - you have all the links right there.

* You can use /r/mushroomkingdom to keep track of your trades even if you don't have enough for a new mushroom - just keep editing in your trades and message the mods when you hit a new tier. 

Feel free to post any other tips you have [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1g76x8/mod_suggestion_thread_follow_up_post/cahdu7o) 

___________________________________
___________________________________

We started a new suggestion thread around the beginning of the month, and wanted to respond to a few suggestions and other comments made by you the community. The format will be the following:

&gt;**Question/Suggestion**

* Response

While a lot of the suggestions/concerns/comments were addressed in that thread, we'd like some of them to be seen in the post body for easy viewing, and some clarity.  Here we go:

&gt;**People posting enormous lists of games and then having 99% of them be ""nearly impossible to get from me"".**

* There's nothing that we can do about enforcing any policy on this as there's no way to know if a game is *really* available or not. That said, if you don't have any intention of even *considering* swapping the game, it should not appear in your post, and it definitely shouldn't be used as bait in your title. Also, because people have subjective ways to value their games, what you consider 'fair' and what your potential trade partner considers 'fair' may not be the same - this doesn't mean that it's not available.

&gt;**I would love to see some trade stats. Maybe a count of successful trades each month with each new confirmation thread.**

* Counting successful trades is difficult because not everyone confirms their trades. That said, a rough estimate for the last complete successful trade post (May 3 to May 24th) is 236 confirmed swaps for an average of 11 trades per day.

* Additionally, here are the subreddit traffic stats for the last little bit. [Album](http://imgur.com/a/ElyUF). 

&gt;**With so many subs and posts becoming buried within a day or 2, would you consider lowering the post dates from 7 days to maybe 5?**

* This comes up a lot, and while we understand the basis for wanting less than 7 days, there is really no need to reduce the posting limit at this time.  Depending on your settings, the front page is ~100 posts long, and those 100 posts span ~3/4 days. After your post dies down (and even before that...) it's now time to shop your list around and do some grunt work. If you're looking for a specific game, use the search button in the sidebar. If you're only looking for a certain console, they are sorted by new in the menu bar. 

&gt;**What if there was a place for swappers to socialize/discuss/joke/memes/circlejerk/upswag/yolo or something. Or maybe not, I don't know. I'm thinking more socialize and discuss more than circlejerk and upswag, but I don't know.**

* We are going to start a weekly or bi-weekly post for non-trade related comments. Feel free to let us know about that below. Also mentioned was maintaining a list of our gamertags, friend codes, steam names etc. We could use the subreddit wiki for this. Please discuss that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1g76x8/mod_suggestion_thread_follow_up_post/cahe1uu). 

&gt;**have another flair for someone who is also verified on multiple trade subreddits**

* You're more than welcome to put that information in your trade posts for others to see, but we will not be incorporating that.

&gt;**console images and/or tables are weird and messed when using mobile apps**

* Gameswap is best used via a browser, preferably on a computer. If you *must* use your phone, it's best viewed using a mobile browser (Chrome for Android works wonderfully - don't know about iOS or other platforms.) If you are addicted to an app, there's not much that we can do. We feel that the benefits outweigh the cons re: tables and console images. Most image users are using both the image shortcuts and text though.

&gt;**how do i know some one will go with a trade and not steal something from me?**

* The best way to ensure that, at least at the beginning is to find 'established' swappers (10+ trades). It's not a requirement, so if you find someone else with blue or no flair make sure to follow the FAQ as far as our recommendations go for suggested swap order. Get pictures of the items with a username - if they resist or make excuses, walk away. Require delivery confirmation from both parties- if they resist, walk away. If ANYTHING feels 'off' in the trade - better safe than sorry... walk away. This applies to every swap, but especially if you're nervous about participating in the community.

&gt;**I'm just curious, why are the comment scores hidden? And can we, um, change upvotes into upswags plz?**

* Comment scores are hidden for 24 hours because the nature of our subreddit is not, and should not be, driven by karma. 
*^(Note: The user who asked this was banned for using 'upswags.')*

~~......................................................................................................................................................~~

Let's start at the beginning of the trading process.

**Step 1:**

Before you even begin posting your trade, think a bit. Do you have enough time/money to ship something out? Is the trade be fair for both parties? Are you willing to compensate in some areas?

**Step 2:** 

Format your title correctly!
   
    [Country] H: games [system]. W: games [system]

What you *have first*, what you *want second*.
Also, make sure your title is spelt correctly.

**Step 3:**

Try to be somewhat coherent whilst typing. I'm sure I've jinxed myself by saying this, but good grammar and spell check can save lives. The only way I can judge someone on the Internet is by how they type, and if they come across as an illiterate punk, then I have little drive to trade with them. Your writing doesn't have to be perfect, but the more professional your ""ad"", the more people will want to trade with you.

**Step 4:**

Add pictures and be honest!
Don't add pictures of just your items, though! Slip a piece of paper with your username on it. Add r/gameswap to the paper for even more verification. It takes less than 2 minutes to take a picture, and upload it to Imgur. Having a snapshot with the game box and username in the OP is always good. 
Be honest about what you have, also. No one likes to get a scratched game when the OP said it was mint. Also, if you don't have the box and manual, tell us! It's still deceiving someone if you're not lying. 

**Step 5:**
When you've begun your trade keep in contact with the person.
Ask the person to post in your thread if they contacted you via PM. This allows the fact that you two have been talking to be on ""public record"". 

* Post when you've begun a deal with someone

* PM to confirm the deal with someone

* Confirm who's doing what first via PM or OP

* Both parties should exchange personal info via PM (name + address etc.)

* Confirm when you've sent your item via PM or OP

* Confirm when each member has received their item via PM and OP

* Post feedback for your partner in the feedback post in the sidebar.

When I say via PM or OP, the rule of thumb is just to continue contact where you've generally been doing it.

~~......................................................................................................................................................~~

The main thing I'm trying to get at after all this, though, is just be professional and you'll have a good time in r/gameswap.

As redditors, we know that we share common interests (like our love of cats) and that we are kinda good at talking to each other (at least virtually :/ ).

Throughout my tenure of trading on this subreddit, I've noticed that I'm sometimes shipping to a lot of the same areas (NYC, Austin, California, etc...).  I kinda like some of you. I tolerate mostly all of you! So I thought maybe we could have a monthly or semi-monthly (is this a thing?) post to coordinate and organize different meetups for GameSwappers in common areas.

Some ideas for meet-ups could be:

* Street Pass meetups at certain locations
* Shopping meetups at thrift stores or interesting game stores
* Meetups involving beverages at agreed upon establishments
* Virtual meetups to play an online game of some sort

So, please use the comments of this post to start a meetup in your area (if you want) or in an area you might be traveling to soon. I'll go ahead and start with the first comment.

*NOTE:* Please always try to be safe and cautious. I trust most of you, but not all of you, so vigilance should be maintained in order to keep all of our fellow swappers safe. Never meetup with people you're not comfortable with, and try to meetup in public places until you're all comfortable with each other.

**EDIT** - Since I got 2 offers in the first 60 seconds (are you guys human?) I've decided that in the absence of a dollar price, it's time to come up with a creative rationing device.  I'm open to suggestions... what's the online equivalent of rock-paper-scissors?

Also, thanks to [bsturtle's reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/gzkcp/up_for_grabs_portal_2_for_ps3_including_the/c1ri7t0) I've just learned about [/r/playitforward](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward).  I urge anyone who receives this game from me to pass it on to another redditor when you're done with it.

~~I consider myself a gamer first and a collector second.~~ Who am I kidding anymore?  I'm a collector in a gamers body.  If you have a game that I want to play, I'd certainly rather have an original version or Collector's Edition, but I'm just fine with a Greatest Hits version.  I only have a few specifics that I'm looking for, so I'm really looking to check out lists.  I'm constantly shifting my attention to other games (damn gamer ADD) so you never know what will really catch my eye!

Everything on this list is potentially up for trade.  If I own it, and there is absolutely no way I'm trading it, it isn't listed here.  Pretty straight forward on availability.  The more asterisks, the harder it is for me to let go of that game.  I'm always willing to trade, so here is a guide to what the asterisks mean to me:  

1= No hesitation.  This game is absolutely up for trade.  
2= I like it, but I'm most probably done with it.  Still absolutely up for trade.  
3= I'm just as willing to keep it as I am willing to trade it.  
4= Most likely still being played in my house or just a game that I *LOVE* owning.  
5= Probably in my backlog and not necessarily looking to trade, but if the price is right...  

**NOTE:  The number of asterisks I assign to a game by no means denotes the monetary value that I place on a game.  Only my willingness to trade said game.  I don't expect to rip anyone off just because I have 5 asterisks next to a game, nor do I plan on just giving away any 1 asterisk games.  I try to be fair and expect the same.**

**FYI** - I LOVE RPG's, especially JRPG's.  They're by far, my favorite genre.  If you have ANY RPG not listed here, I very well may be interested in it.  Shoot me an offer and let's see what we can do!   So, without further adieu, here's the goods!:

When confirming a trade, simply type this: `[](/confirmed)` and you'll have everyone wondering how you worked your magic. 


Post your successful trades here and confirm them! If you recently posted in the [previous successful trade thread](http://redd.it/11plou) just have it confirmed it over there. We'll watch that thread and assign shrooms as needed.

When making a successful trade post please provide a link to the thread (specifically the comment) where you and your trade partner initiated and conducted the deal. Obviously details such as addresses and real names should be handled via Private Messages, but negotiating the trade should be all in the open.

Also, if you are getting your blue mushroom, please indicate which mushroom you would like (8bit or HD). If you at any time you would like to switch your shroom look post in [this thread](http://redd.it/u3qqc). Please note that you only get one switch per tier of mushroom so choose wisely.

If you are at 10 or 20 (or more!) confirmed successful trades make a post over at /r/mushroomkingdom with links to each confirmation to get your respective shroom!

If you have any questions be sure to read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq) and if you still have questions [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameswap) and we'll do our best to answer them.

Please wait a week before messaging the mods about receiving your mushroom. We're busy individuals and sometimes stuff slips through the cracks. Also, if you're looking to get your blue mushroom don't post to mushroomkingdom. We assign blue mushrooms via this thread. 

As always, free upvotes for those that confirm their trades (both sides have to confirm!).

Please remember to include a link to the thread where you initiated the swap. Your trade won't count as confirmed unless you can provide a link to the original offer.

Keep up the good work gameswappers!",,False,,t5_2rbm7,1355032881.0,,osuperstar,True,t3_13zvcr,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/13zvcr/successful_trade_thread_started_november_29_2012/,

First and foremost, the changes were made with the NEW users in mind.  We have been gaining subscribers at a pretty steady clip and we wanted the most important parts of the subreddit to be the most obvious. 

As you might have noticed, we have moved the suggestion thread to the fore-front to encourage discussion.  The thread will be monitored.  We have ALMOST completely finished updating and revising our FAQ.  This was a very lengthy process.  

Since we spent a LOT of time updating it we also moved that front and center by giving it, it's very own tab.  

Even if you've made a bunch of trades... READ IT!  Let us know what you think.  

In conjunction with the updated FAQ, we have also attempted to update the sidebar  by giving more information in less space.  If you have suggestions or think something should be added... PLEASE let us know!  

We have tried to tie the Side-bar more directly and logically to the FAQ.  

We still have some fun ideas coming up but I don't want to spoil the surprise/hard work going into it.  So stay tuned.  

----

**Quick Reminders:**

* When confirming swaps, PLEASE include a link to the trade thread where the offer was made.  

* Don't accept offers via PM.  First, you won't get a mushroom for it.  Second (and more importantly) banned users can still browse and PM you.  They can't post.  Think about it.  

* Keep being awesome.  

* Practice safe swapping.  Always use confirmation. ",,False,,t5_2rbm7,1341170286.0,,superstar,True,t3_vvz0i,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/vvz0i/psa_springcleaning_recent_updates_coming_changes/,

First of all, if you have Steam only games you are looking to trade, put [Steam] at the beginning of your post.

* [Steam] [H] Portal [W] Audiosurf

Out of all of those trades only 9!!! people are banned from /gameswap because of bad trades.

If we only assume people that have mushrooms have traded once that makes a 98% trade success rate.  If we more realistically say an average of 3 trades per person that is **a 99.4% success rate.**


Currently the mods are working on putting in place a separate subreddit where all of the successful trades will be posted at and it will have an automatic process to handout mushrooms.  Currently I've been updating the mushrooms for the past 2 weeks or so and it takes a good couple of hours every couple of days so this will be a welcome relief!

Hopefully this system will be tested in the coming week and go live shortly after that.

I've gotten the mushrooms updated up until today at noon, if it has been a few days since **both** of you posted in the successful trade thread and you still don't have mushrooms, message me directly and I'll check it out.  If you can provide the link to both of your posts it will help out tremendously. 

Somethings that have been coming to our attention:

1. Please keep the subreddit clean with only trade requests.  If you have a problem with how things are done, a certain trade, or something else, please just message the mods and we'll look into it.
2. /r/gameswap is for trading GAMES/SYSTEMS. Do not post asking for handouts, offering money/paypal, or other household goods.  If you have something else you wish to trade please take it to one of the other reddit trading threads.
3. It is up to you to make sure your game gets to the other person, if you don't want to get a Delivery Confirmation code, package it well, or get insurance it is up to you, but if the post office screws up and loses or damages it and they wont make it right it is up to you to either return the other person's game or work out a replacement.  
4. Keep all arguments out of the main reddit, message the mods.  We don't need to be slandering people's good name before a resolution is reached.
5. Only repost a trade once a week at the most and if you haven't gotten any biters you might want to rethink the trade.  Everybody and their mother has Portal 1, so spice up the deal and maybe throw in something else.
6. SEARCH! before you post.  There is a good chance someone has asked for what you want.  Also look for 3 way trades with people.

Keep up the good work people, you are making this what I think is THE BEST subreddit there is!",,False,,t5_2rbm7,True,,redshroom,True,t3_hf66h,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/hf66h/quick_stat_just_updated_the_mushrooms/,moderator

I decided to figure out how much it was benefiting me versus selling/buying used games back to Gamestop. In the end, he was convinced. I figured I'd share it with the rest of you.

====================================================

GAMES I'VE SWAPPED: 
(My Original Purchase Price + Shipping + Other)

====================================================

* HEAVY RAIN ------ ($60 NEW + $3 SHIPPING)
* PROTOTYPE ------ ($60 NEW + $3 SHIPPING)
* MIRROR'S EDGE --- ($60 NEW + $3 SHIPPING + $15 TO BOOST TRADE)
* UNCHARTED 2 ---- (GAMESWAP + $3 SHIPPING) 

APPROX EXPENSE OF GAMES BOUGHT/SHIPPED: **$207**

APPROX VALUE IF BUYING USED THEM TODAY: **$135**

====================================================

GAMES I'VE RECEIVED FOR ABOVE GAMES:
(Used Price / Kept or Not)

====================================================

* UNCHARTED 2 -----($40 / PLAYED, THEN SWAPPED OUT)
* RESIDENT EVIL 5 -- ($25 / KEPT)
* BIOSHOCK 1 ------ ($20 / KEPT)
* BIOSHOCK 2 ------ ($33 / KEPT)
* ORANGE BOX ----- ($20 / KEPT)
* DEMON'S SOULS -- ($25 / KEPT)

APPROX VALUE APPROX OF GAMES RECEIVED: **$163** 

====================================================

MY OUT OF POCKET INVESTMENT LOSS: **$44**

====================================================

THE REAL DIFFERENCE: 

* 3 new games out

* 5 used games in

* 1 used game in/out

* I've played 9 Games for $207.00

* NEW? It would have cost me $540.00 (SAVED 332.00)

* USED? It would cost me about $298 if I bought them ALL today 

* I STILL WOULD HAVE SAVED $91!

Feel free to talk about gaming, specific games (see below for spoiler information) and start a comment thread to gather gamertags/profile names/friend codes for specific games. So, hopefully this catches on and we can have them every week or two (depending on activity, community participation etc.)

###Spoiler Information and how to tag!

/r/gameswap uses the /r/AskReddit method for covering spoilers with tags that now even work on mobile apps. The new format is as follows: [THE LAST OF US SPOILER](#s ""NAUGHTY DOG IS NAUGHTY"") Hover your mouse over the black section to reveal the spoiler. Here's what I typed exactly to make this (it's not an actual spoiler): 

`[THE LAST OF US SPOILER](#s ""NAUGHTY DOG IS NAUGHTY"")`Which will show up as spoiler. Note that the "" "" are important. 

**Because the nature of our subreddit is revolved around gaming, and playing games we haven't played before - be very mindful of potential major spoilers in games**. Saying that Mario saves the princess at the end of Super Mario Bros. from NES is one thing, but ruining the end of Red Dead Redemption for someone just isn't cool - please utilize the spoiler tag. **If you see potential spoilers for a game, please ask the user to tag it. If they don't tag it, please report it.**  ***Purposely spoiling games will lead to a posting ban.***

###EDIT: Let's have an upvote fest - get those pipe piranha's moving.

Additionally - keep links to your trade posts out of these threads, that is not the purpose of these. ",,False,,t5_2rbm7,1371481940.0,,osuperstar,True,t3_1ginbk,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1ginbk/weekly_community_discussion_thread/,

 - There is a lot of useful information in the sidebar already! 
 - Something that should be obvious is that you should NEVER ship games in plain paper envelopes.  
 - You should always ship in something tamper-proof.  
 - Plastic Mailers, Bubble Envelopes, Legal Mailers are all great ways to ship.  Priority Boxes are good too, albeit more expensive.  
 - The link in the sidebar for printing your own labels with Paypal will save you money.  It's normally around $2 to ship one game with tracking.  
 - Save the bubble mailers you get in the mail.  Use them on future swaps.  



2.  **Flair Abuse - Bullying**
 - Under no circumstances will we allow users to bully other users.  
 - We are going to leave this purposefully vague.
 - Lets just say that if you've been here for a while, you know the rules.  You know the do's and dont's.  You should be encouraging users to follow the rules not break them for your own benefit.  
 - This will be treated similarly to scamming and thread crapping.  It will not be tolerated. 



3.  **Deleting Posts and Threads**
 - Users should NEVER delete posts or threads.  EVER!!
 - Your comment history is your friend... it will help us, help you... if anything ever goes wrong.
 - If someone who is not a moderator tells you to delete a thread, message the mods immediately.  You should never delete your posts here. 
 - Seriously... in case you missed it the first 3 times I said it... you should NEVER delete your threads/posts.  It trains the Spam Filter to hate you and it's really hard to get offers for your games if you delete your thread.



4.  **Negotiating in Public**
 - We want to see this.  Seriously.  We will start exercising our discretion more often in denying confirmations where negotiations don't take place in public.  
 - We can't see your PMs and we don't want more established users taking advantage of other swappers by using bait-and-switch tactics... or by pressuring newbies to make trades through PM.  


5.  **RECOMMENDED Swap Order**
 -  It's like just a recommendation, man.  You can agree to whatever you want... that's like your choice or something... but it's like there for your protection. Right on. 


6.  **PSA's**
 - We've always encouraged users to be active in this community.
 - PSA's are here for everyone to use.  
 - If you think there is something important that needs to be discussed or if you see a trend of bad behavior... don't wait for it to be a bigger problem.  Address it!  Create a PSA!  
 - We try to do as much as we can, but sometimes these things mean more when they come from the community as opposed to us... coming in... wagging our fingers.  

7.  **Double-Stuff Oreos**
 - Are actually more than 2 times as delicious as regular Oreos.  The math is mind-boggling. 


-----

If there is anything you guys want to address, things you want to see us add, ideas you have about things we can do to make the community better or more enjoyable... please don't hesitate to share here or to message us privately.  I will add and edit the body of this post if there is good discussion that could be added.

Back one more time and I really need your help. I've just passed the 60% complete mark with my N64 fullset and I'd love to get it finished up. The carts I need are in this post **[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/18998d/usa_h_dishonored_far_cry_3_list_360_gta_4/)**.

Aside from that, I'm willing to listen to any offers you may have. I'd like more Dreamcast and PS1 games if CIB, but I really just want to look at your lists. Open for any/all consoles. If I don't have it, I may want it, so don't be afraid to offer!

When making an offer, please let me know what you want first. Some things will be easy to get, where other things I probably would rather keep unless you can help fill a hole in my N64 set. My interest in your items will vary depending on what I'm at stake to lose

**[All my carts can be found on this post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/retrogameswap/comments/1ccuew/usa_h_assorted_nessnes_carts_some_other_things_w/)** if you are interested in some SNES or NES games. Couple decent ones over there, like  Zombies Ate my Neighbors or Contra)

This will be everything I own, including some pics of books and dvds/blurays at the very end. If a game had a pass, assume that pass **has been used**. I got a lot of these secondhand, so I have no idea. Just to err on the side of caution, don't plan of them still being good.

Thanks for looking, and happy swapping!

(side note: I'm willing to send/receive Paypal if necessary to balance out a trade)

(another side note: Some of these items are for sale in other places, so don't be afraid to offer quick!)

(another side note: [this is my mushroomkingdom thread, with 309 confirmed trades](http://www.reddit.com/r/mushroomkingdom/comments/144q4o/lamanamanumi_200_trades/)

We also made notice of additional styles of the gold/silver shroom last week [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/17zwf5/mod_8bit_goldsilver_flair_and_new_top_level_flair/).

Thanks to /u/Brash_Attack, we now have ""8-bit"" versions of the Superstar and the newly introduced Triforce. If they comment here, [please upvote them into a coma.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/18etfz/mod_we_now_have_two_versions_of_each_flair_make/c8e9k11)

As a reminder: to receive your blue mushroom, your account must be 3 months old. The list of requirements for mushrooms are listed in the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/wiki/faq#wiki_what_do_i_need_to_get_my_own_mushroom.3F) and will be adhered to more strictly in the future. 

As always - any questions can be posed to the moderators via the ""Message the Mods"" button. We'll also take questions in this thread if there are any.

Again - if you'd like to request a change in flair style - do so in this thread.

1324572974.0,19,self.gameswap,nmrto,[Moderator Message] Reminder: Do not post games more than once a week.,YogurtSoda,24,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/nmrto/moderator_message_reminder_do_not_post_games_more/,"This is a copy of a message posted by HJI (with very minor edits by me).

**Do not post games more than once a week.**

We ask this to **avoid clutter** in the subreddit and to **give others a chance** at having their games being seen. Please **edit your existing threads** if you have something different to offer.

In a related note, please **do not delete old threads**. We ask this for four reasons:

1) Trades sometimes go bad. We like to have a record of what went wrong.

2) People use the search bar from time to time to find game offers/requests.

3) Other people may arrange trades within your threads. This may be of questionable etiquette, but it happens nonetheless.

4) **The more you delete your posts, the more the spam filter hates you and eats them.**

Those reposters who delete threads to somehow to mask that they are reposting within a week are just showing their guilty mind.

**We are going to start handing out temporary bans to those choose to ignore this message (and possibly permabans for the more egregious cases).**

On an unrelated note, please **post what country you are from in the beginning of your thread (*even on digital trades* I cannot stress this enough as it lessens the chance of the spam filter eating your post)**. We've had a lot of users post threads containing region specific games lately and it's annoying to find out that a potential trade cannot be done because of a region lock.

**Take a look at the FAQ for more information:** http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq

Your humble servant,

HJI

Edit: added bsturtle's suggestions

Edit 2: Imagine what this place would turn into if people posted a new thread whenever they got a new game. It would cease to function around every Steam Holiday Sale or whenever a Humble Indie Bundle released.

We don't want to watch over this place like hawks. We'd appreciate if you guys work with us here. This rule is in the best interest of the community as a whole.

I'm an amigurumi crafter and I crochet nerdy plushies as my hobby.  I also play several games online and have friends with limited funds wanting to play some games they don't have.  I'd like to trade some of my work for these games.  For BFBC2 I'd prefer new if at all possible so the code works, but I suppose beggers can't be choosers :)

Currently completed plush that are ready to go:

[Smash Brothers Kirby](http://nerdigurumi.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/kirby2.jpg) with a Mario or Luigi hat or Princess Peach crown

[Goomba](http://nerdigurumi.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/goomba2.jpg)

I can make pretty much anything.  The more complex it is the more time involved.  Most of the pieces listed above involve around 3-5 hours of work, more complex things with lots of parts sewn together or sets take more time.  I am thinking 1 plush (unless really complicated custom) would = 1 game but if you have something else in mind, let me know.  Have a look at [my website](http://nerdigurumi.com/) for an idea of what I have done/can do.  Once you start getting into small details, weapons, clothing and hair, it gets more difficult/time intensive.  If you have the games I am looking for and would like to discuss a custom plushie, please msg me with what you have in mind and we'll talk.  Unfortunately I am not really looking for any other games, only these two.

Thanks!

edit:  just to add this wouldn't have to be a doll or toy, could be a case for DS or PSP, a pokeball hat, Punch Out pixel scarf, pretty much anything crocheted.

Also, Common Courtesy Reminders.",_deffer_,20,6,190,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1k88wr/mod_message_important_new_flair_policy_change/,"Due to [recent events](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1k53nl/psa_scammer_alert_we_need_to_be_more_cautious/), as well as a long standing desire among the mods to modify how users obtain flair early on, we've decided to implement a new system.

---

###The Changes:

* Users who ***had*** blue flair now have pink flair. 
* Blue flair will now be assigned to users who have ***FIVE*** confirmed trades. 
* There is no flair assigned for trades 1-4.
* Blue flair will be requested like all the higher tiers over in /r/MushroomKingdom starting today. 
* **Pink flair will disappear after October 12th (two months.)**

**Note**: Mobile users who don't see flair images, but see flair text will still see ""Blue Mushroom"" for those with pink mushrooms. This will be worked on and changed eventually - it's not as easy as flipping a switch (although it really should be.) Browser users will still see ""Blue Mushroom"" upon hover, but the color of the mushroom is to be trusted over the hover text.

--- 

####Questions &amp; Answers:

&gt; I don't have flair yet. Will my first confirmed trade in the future get me a pink mushroom?
&gt;&gt; No. Pink flair is only for users who had blue flair before today. 

---

&gt; Why are you doing this?
&gt;&gt; We're doing this because it's going to end up preventing 'drive-by scamming'. 

---

&gt; What is 'drive-by scamming?'
&gt;&gt; Basically it gives ~~users~~ assholes an opportunity to take advantage of others easily after discovering gameswap. This new policy will mostly cut down on this type of scam. 

---

&gt; I have pink flair, but I have 5+ confirmed trades... what gives? 
&gt;&gt; If you have 5+ confirmed trades, please visit /r/MushroomKingdom to request your blue flair following the policies stated.

---

(Will add more questions &amp; answers as they pop up)

---
---

####Common courtesy reminders!

###Respond to ALL offers!

* Even if it's just a simple ""no thanks"", you should be responding to every offer made on your thread.

###What are you interested in???

* Posting your list, and asking ""See anything?"" isn't helpful. List what you are interested in when you make your comment to save everyone time.

###Only list what you are willing to ACTUALLY trade!

* Items that are 'impossible to get' from you should not be on your list in your trade section. Making a list to what you currently have (a personal collection) is okay - just make it known in your post that those games are untouchable, and offers will be turned down. 

### *Properly* describe your items!

* For example, if you have Battlefield 3 Limited/Premium, but the codes have been redeemed, you don't have the Limited or Premium editions of those games, you have vanilla Battlefield 3 with different box art. You should have some or all of what made the edition Limited/Collectors/Premium to list it as such. If you ***don't*** have anything that makes it LE/CE/PE, then just list in your game details that you have the box art for the specific edition. 
* Additionally, you should be describing your items in your post body. There shouldn't need to be questions from users regarding edition, release, codes included etc. Greatest Hits/Platinum Hits/Nintendo Select cases/box art should be given. Disc condition, missing manual etc. **Everything** should be described.

---
---

As always, any comments/questions will be welcomed and encouraged below. If it's a question worth everyone seeing, we'll add it to the top post. Additionally, we will need a little time to edit the FAQ/Sidebar according to this new policy, so any questions about conflicting information should be brought up to the mods after a day or two. 

This will replace the weekly discussion thread for the week, but it will return next week. As such, please keep all conversations in this thread 'on-topic' regarding the new flair and the common courtesy reminders. 

###Edited to add that Pink flair will disappear after two months.

* We're in the top 200 all time for submissions on reddit (#198). 

* We're top 150 for average comments per day (853 comments/day, #139 - over a weekly span ending June 6th - likely higher/lower on a weekly basis)

* We average 29 submissions per day.

* Our peak users present at /r/gameswap at one time is 134 users. That happened on March 20th - anyone have a clue what the significance is?

After agreeing to a swap, parties migrate over to PM to work out the details. 

Here are some simple points everyone should consider discussing via PM

1. **Confirm what games you will be swapping**
2. **Take pictures of your games and send to other party**
3. **Confirm who will ship first**
4. **Trade shipping addresses** - Print off shipping address, as well as game list to be shipped to this party to avoid confusion of multiple trades
5. **Confirm that games will be shipped in a protected method (see /u/Luclicane 's post for more information)**. *Nothing should ever be shipped in a paper envelope!*



If we all follow these simple guidelines, we can avoid a world of headaches afterwards.

1368733921.0,17,self.gameswap,1egyce,[MOD] A few style tweaks.,_deffer_,17,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1egyce/mod_a_few_style_tweaks/,"So we've added some tabs at the top of the subreddit in the header to help streamline searching for specific console games. 

For example - clicking on the 360 tab, will give you only posts with 360 related material, sorted by new. Fairly self explanatory - but I would like to point out two things. With the 3DS and the WiiU tabs, there are actually four buttons there.  The `3` and `DS` are separate buttons, and the `Wii` and `U` are also separate buttons.  So, if you are looking *specifically* for 3DS games, click on the 3.  If you're looking for DS games, click on DS.  If you are looking for specifically WiiU games, click on the U, and original Wii, click on the Wii. 

Additionally, the search page has been tweaked (a result of the above styling) to remove the large ugly gray section that used to be up top. A consequence of this is that you can not re-search from that page.  We've always suggested using the `Browse Trades` button [in the sidebar](http://www.rgameswap.com/list.pl#/button/c/green/p/left/) for specific searches anyway, so this might not be a big deal for anyone.

As always - let us know any thoughts or concerns in the comments below.

1368707522.0,16,self.gameswap,1eg3ga,Organization matters! Create a table!,_deffer_,19,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1eg3ga/organization_matters_create_a_table/,"All right, for those of you who want to make tables, here's the cheat sheet for Markdown/Reddit table markup:

Say we want to make this table:

Game | Condition | Console
:--|:--:|--:
Phoenix Wright | Good | DS
Halo 3 | Fair | Xbox 360
Mass Effect 2 | New | PS3

The first thing you'll need is your header row:

    Game | Condition | Console

Each `|`-separated block of text will become one column.

Second, you'll need to specify how you want things aligned. Use:

* `:--` for left-align
* `:--:` for center-align
* `--:` for right-align

In this case, we want the **Game** column left-aligned, the **Condition** column center-aligned, and the **Console** column right-aligned, so we'll use this:

    :--|:--:|--:

Finally, put each row of your table, with columns, once again, separated by `|`:

    Phoenix Wright | Good | DS
    Halo 3 | Fair | Xbox 360
    Mass Effect 2 | New | PS3

***

Putting it all together, we get:

`Game | Condition | Console`  
`:--|:--:|--:`  
`Phoenix Wright | Good | DS`  
`Halo 3 | Fair | Xbox 360`  
`Mass Effect 2 | New | PS3`

You can also use spaces/dashes within the table to line things up, although it's not necessary. The code below\* gives the same table as above:

     Game           | Condition |  Console
    ::--------------|:---------:|--------:
     Phoenix Wright |    Good   |       DS
     Halo 3         |    Fair   | Xbox 360 
     Mass Effect 2  |    New    |      PS3

_\*Except without that extra `:` at the beginning of the alignment line - that was necessary to keep Reddit from turning that into an actual table._

_Edit:_ Fix formatting breakage.

Usually the team discusses these sort of things, but for a moment now I have been overcome with nostalgia, but the good kind when you know that while the past has been good, the future will be better. I'm not around as much as I used to be, and you all are supported by an excellent team of moderators. Without them gently guiding the community, I can't imagine this place being any more successful. And that success is also due in great part to the community itself. 

I made one of the first confirmed trades here and at the time I don't think anyone would have guessed we would have grown in this way. I haven't checked the numbers in the while, but last time I did, we were averaging 200-300 trades a month. That is crazy. It used to be so few of us, there was no successful trade thread at all, but instead we made a regular post announcing the trade (back then it was a pretty big deal I suppose). 

I'm not usually the kind of person that takes the time to reflect, or look very far into the near or distant future, preferring to live in the moment. As I make the novice's attempt, I'd like all of us to spend a moment and think what can *I* do to strengthen the community and continue its successful growth. And I don't mean suggestions to the mods, or new changes in the rules. But the sort of things that make a community a community; welcoming new members with a virtual smile and ensuring we are acting responsibly ourselves. 

I don't have a grandfather or grandmother or even a father that used to say anything worth repeating. But I was a child of the 80s, so I'll take what I can. Be excellent to each other.

I've got everything else with it (ac adapter, soft case, original battery as well as hacked battery).


The gist here though, is I'd like to give this to someone who has a child, but can't necessarily afford something like this for their kid, so I'm willing to give this away for free, hell, I never play with it anyways. All I'm asking is that you must handle the shipping charge. 


Not really sure how to go about having you prove that you really are legit and have a kid in need, so does anyone have suggestions?

Basically, I was tired of looking at my consoles and wanted to sell them.  Gamestop was too cheap, so I decided to advertise here.  I wanted to sell a PS3 Xbox 360 and 14 games between them, all with accessories.  Within minutes I received a reply from RodJohnsonSays.  

Here's an overview of our transaction:  

* He first made sure he understood the deal completely, $250 for everything under the listing.  
* He then asked for my location (which I could have specified in my listing), but as we live on opposite coasts, shipping would be required.  
* I suggested paypal for payment, but this would only help my side.  Upon some reddit research, I saw that some users exchanged pictures of themselves holding ID's, for trust. 
* RodJohnsonSays suggested we talk on aim.  We talked for about an hour. It was there he mentioned he wanted to get the 360 for his brother (what a guy).  
* After talking, we saw that neither of us wanted to screw each other over, so we forwent the idea of trading pictures with ID's.  We exchanged phone numbers instead, for easier communication with texting.  
* When paypal was sorted out, he sent half of the payment + shipping cost upfront.  I shipped it via FedEx ground.
* I gave him the confirmation #, and when the package arrived today, he paid the other half.  

All in all, I could not be happier with the sale.  It went to a great guy, and now I have more space in my room.

Note that there are two sets of square brackets [TEXT][] and that the "" "" are important. Typed exactly as above, it will show as this in posts:

So, hopefully this catches on and we can have them every week or two (depending on activity, community participation etc.)

###Spoiler Information and how to tag!

/r/gameswap uses the /r/AskReddit method for covering spoilers with tags that now even work on mobile apps. The new format is as follows: [THE LAST OF US SPOILER](#s ""NAUGHTY DOG IS NAUGHTY"") Hover your mouse over the black section to reveal the spoiler. Here's what I typed exactly to make this (***it's not an actual spoiler***): 

`[THE LAST OF US SPOILER](#s ""NAUGHTY DOG IS NAUGHTY"")`Which will show up as spoiler. Note that the "" "" are important. 

**Because the nature of our subreddit is revolved around gaming, and playing games we haven't played before - be very mindful of potential major spoilers in games - even if they are older**. Saying that Mario saves the princess at the end of Super Mario Bros. from NES is one thing, but ruining the end of Red Dead Redemption for someone just isn't cool - please utilize the spoiler tag. **If you see potential spoilers for a game, please ask the user to tag it. If they don't tag it, please report it.**  ***Purposely spoiling games will lead to a posting ban.***

1370715151.0,15,self.gameswap,1fxqkz,[USA][PSA] Community feedback wanted for a certain trading situation,Whambamm,21,6,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1fxqkz/usapsa_community_feedback_wanted_for_a_certain/,"I recently experienced a trading situation that, after having talked to the mods, I felt warranted everyone's feedback. 

My situation was as follows: 

I agreed to a trade with a fellow redditor who shall remain nameless. The agreed upon trade was Nameless was going to send me Game A in exchange for my Games B and C. We both agreed to the trade, exchanged shipping information, and Nameless agreed to ship his side the following day. The next night I get a message from Nameless telling me that someone offered him a 'better deal' for Game B and that we needed to renegotiate. I refused since we already had an agreement in place and I will not be trading with Nameless in the future.

So, my question to the community is this: What should we do in future situations such as this? This isn't a bannable offense as no games actually switched hands, but we had already agreed to terms. I don't want to give Nameless's name out because I don't want a witch hunt, but at the same time I feel he should be held accountable for his actions.

Any and all feedback is appreciated.

It seems that there is quite a lot of friendly banter and community chat that pops up all over the place.  I figured, why not give the community a place to swap gamer handles to play online???   

So, if you'd like to have other people from the community add you, post the following:  

* Platform(s) you play on    
* Handle you use for said platform(s) (Be specific which handle is for which platform if you are on multiple systems)       
* Types of games you tend to play    
* Perhaps list a few games you're currently playing     

A concern was expressed to me that putting your tags in public view might attract some unwanted attention.  If you're concerned that people whom you wish not to add you will attempt to bother you, or concerned about trolling, I would recommend putting something along the lines of ""PM me if you're interested in gaming and we can exchange tags"" in place of your handle!

If you recently posted in the [previous successful trade thread](http://redd.it/xidoa) just have it confirmed it over there. I'll watch that thread and assign shrooms as needed.

When making a successful trade post please provide a link to the thread (specifically the comment) where you and your trade partner initiated and conducted the deal. Obviously details such as addresses and real names should be handled via Private Messages, but negotiating the trade should be all in the open.

Also, if you are getting your blue mushroom, please indicate which mushroom you would like (8bit or HD). If you at any time you would like to switch your shroom look post in [this thread](http://redd.it/u3qqc). Please note that you only get one switch per tier of mushroom so choose wisely.

If you are at 10 or 20 (or more!) confirmed successful trades make a post over at /r/mushroomkingdom with links to each confirmation to get your respective shroom!

If you have any questions be sure to read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq) and if you still have questions [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameswap) and we'll do our best to answer them.

Please wait a week before messaging the mods about receiving your mushroom. We're busy individuals and sometimes stuff slips through the cracks. 

As always, free upvotes for those that confirm their trades (both sides have to confirm!).

Please remember to include a link to the thread where you initiated the swap. Your trade won't count as confirmed unless you can provide a link to the original offer.

Direct from the Sidebar/FAQ:

&gt;**Confirming Swaps:**

&gt;Your confirmation post MUST include:

&gt;- **The Games That Were Swapped.**
- The Name of your Swapping Partner.
- A Confirming Post by Your Partner.
- A Link to the Trade Thread.

-------

&gt;**What Do I Need to Get My Own Mushroom?**

&gt;Confirming a Post in the Successful trade thread will earn you a Blue Mushroom.

&gt;New Users or Young Accounts may not be immediately granted a Mushroom.

&gt;- For the Blue mushroom you must complete 1 confirmed trade with an account 3 months old.

&gt;- For the Red mushroom you must have 10 confirmed trades and an account 3 months old.

&gt;- For the Green mushroom you must have 20 confirmed trades and an account 6 months old.

&gt;- For the Silver mushroom you must have 50 confirmed trades and an account 6 months old.

&gt;- For the Gold mushroom you must have 75 confirmed trades and an account 6 months old.

&gt;- For the Super Star you must have 100 confirmed trades and an account 1 year old.

&gt;In addition to Account age restrictions... Karma will also be taken into consideration before awarding mushrooms.  

&gt;All successful trades should still be posted in the successful trade list as normal.

-------

We've been awarding mushrooms and counting non-conforming confirmations on Mushroom Kingdom.  No more.  Age restrictions and Confirmation requirements are going to be followed strictly.  

If you want the mushroom to count.  Include the games that were swapped.  We have our reasons for wanting this information directly in the post.  It's required.  The link to negotiations is not sufficient.  

Thanks for understanding.  If you have any questions or need any help do not hesitate to message the mods.  

I should also point out that this is a VERY minor and isolated problem and that 99% of you guys are doing things great.  Which is evident based on the state of the subreddit.  This is just a friendly reminder but for the most part, there have been very very few instances or issues confirming threads.  

-------------

*Remember:*

- If you message the mods or report a post/thread, include a link to it.  

- Take Pictures and always use Delivery Confirmation. 
- Follow the recommended Shipping Order.
- If you're new, please read the FAQ and/or Sidebar before swapping... it's really valuable here.  It is littered with good information about the mistakes of others and how to avoid repeating them.

If you recently posted in the [previous successful trade thread](http://redd.it/ynsi9) just have it confirmed it over there. I'll watch that thread and assign shrooms as needed.

When making a successful trade post please provide a link to the thread (specifically the comment) where you and your trade partner initiated and conducted the deal. Obviously details such as addresses and real names should be handled via Private Messages, but negotiating the trade should be all in the open.

Also, if you are getting your blue mushroom, please indicate which mushroom you would like (8bit or HD). If you at any time you would like to switch your shroom look post in [this thread](http://redd.it/u3qqc). Please note that you only get one switch per tier of mushroom so choose wisely.

If you are at 10 or 20 (or more!) confirmed successful trades make a post over at /r/mushroomkingdom with links to each confirmation to get your respective shroom!

If you have any questions be sure to read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq) and if you still have questions [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameswap) and we'll do our best to answer them.

Please wait a week before messaging the mods about receiving your mushroom. We're busy individuals and sometimes stuff slips through the cracks. Also, if you're looking to get your blue mushroom don't post to mushroomkingdom. We assign blue mushrooms via this thread. 

As always, free upvotes for those that confirm their trades (both sides have to confirm!).

Please remember to include a link to the thread where you initiated the swap. Your trade won't count as confirmed unless you can provide a link to the original offer.

this website allows you to compare prices across regions, using this it would be pretty easy for you to workout a trade with someone in a different region where both of you spend less money on a game and recieve one thats worth more, as some of the price differences are actually beyond ridiculous.

eg.

* oblivion is 25% cheaper in the UK than in the US o.O
* crysis is 80% more in the US than the UK...
* Dawn of War II is 60% cheaper in ROW than in the UK

/r/gameswap uses the /r/AskReddit method for covering spoilers with tags that now even work on mobile apps. The new format is as follows: [THE LAST OF US SPOILER](#s ""NAUGHTY DOG IS NAUGHTY"") Hover your mouse over the black section to reveal the spoiler. Here's what I typed exactly to make this (***it's not an actual spoiler***): 

`[THE LAST OF US SPOILER](#s ""NAUGHTY DOG IS NAUGHTY"")`Which will show up as spoiler. Note that the "" "" are important. 

**Because the nature of our subreddit is revolved around gaming, and playing games we haven't played before - be very mindful of potential major spoilers in games - even if they are older**. Saying that Mario saves the princess at the end of Super Mario Bros. from NES is one thing, but ruining the end of Red Dead Redemption for someone just isn't cool - please utilize the spoiler tag. **If you see potential spoilers for a game, please ask the user to tag it. If they don't tag it, please report it.**  ***Purposely spoiling games will lead to a posting ban.***

**Changes:**

**Removed games no longer available**

Back for Round 2.  Round 1 was to test the waters, so now for the real deals.  I use a fairly standard asterisk system (fewer * means easier to trade).  If you require further elaboration, however, please refer to the relationship metaphors below:

No*= I want to get rid of it like a really bad itch.  I swear it's giving me creepy looks. 

*= It has slight value to me, but our bond is primarily superficial.  

**= Hard to say if we're aquaintances or friends at this point.  Probably somewhere in between.

***= We hang out a bunch, but does it share the same feelings I'm hiding deep down?  What if it doesn't?  Ooh, now I'm blushing! 

****= Just got engaged last month.  Love is in the air, baby! 

In the event it doesn't look mostly PERFECT, I'll point out any defects for each item.  I will also make note if it's not an original label (aka, Greatest Hits, Player's Choice, etc).  The games have been tested recently, and all (except for Partners in Time) work properly.  Oh, yes, and pictures are always available upon request.

1311647502.0,12,self.gameswap,izs0h,An alternate proposal for Steam trades,blindsight,15,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/izs0h/an_alternate_proposal_for_steam_trades/,"I've been thinking about Steam game scamming and I'd like to (re)-propose a fleshed out proposal for how Steam trades can be done safely without fragmenting the community we all love.

Allow some members of the community who have 10+ successful Steam trades to be middlemen. Since Steam gifts can be sent by email with a unique code like this

*http://storefront.steampowered.com/redirect/?ackgiftpass=UNIQUE-GAME-GIFT-CODE-HERE*

middlemen could receive gift emails from both parties containing the gift codes. To verify that the Steam codes are legit, the middleman *must already own both games being traded*. [As SumDood posted here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/itc0b/message_from_the_mods_its_time_to_sound_off_and/c26hvje), this allows the middleman to verify the code is legitimate *without using up the code*.

Once both games are verified, they get passed on to the counter-parties.

I would suggest having some requirement that people with no trades confirmed by middlemen be *required* to use middlemen, and middlemen should be required unless both parties publicly opt out of using middlemen for their trade (thereby making it public that they expect no scam protection).

In terms of requiring middlemen, then, to be trustworthy: have middlemen submit to the mods some sort of verification of name and address and have them required to have 10 verified Steam trades to be ""accredited"".

I would be willing to be a middleman, and I have 200 Steam games so that's a fair number of titles that could be tradeable by me, and I'm sure there are other people who would be willing to step up who have long enough trade histories.

**TD;DR**

* Middlemen are required for all trades unless both parties have confirmed trades *and* both parties publicly opt out of the protection of using middlemen

* Middlemen who already own both games being traded will verify both Steam EMail gift codes are legit by attempting to use them both

* Once both gifts are verified, the trade is put through by the middleman who then posts in the confirmed trade thread

* Middlemen are required to have many successful trades and pass on personal details to mods to prevent middlemen scamming

Anyone have any thoughts?

Somewhat unrelated, but [here's a Valve response on the legality of trades](http://i614.photobucket.com/albums/tt230/LyFe039384/Valve.jpg). (text below)

&gt;I fully understand that Steam does not support players trading Tf2 items such as hats or metal for Steam Gifts, but, if I do so, would any action be taken against the person I trade with and/or I *(sic)*, assuming both parties agree on the trade, and no scamming occurred?

of you do to. i was thinking we could create a library where verified traders can share 

games. here is how i foresee it to work:

*1. game library would be a new subreddit so as not to interfere with actual trades. 

*2. to participate you must have at least 1 verified trade in r/gameswap (this is open to change, maybe 2 - 5 verified trades). we can keep track of this by checking verified users in r/gameswap.

*3. this can be open to any type of games. physical games make sense, but if people have a spare steam account or can create one to share that may be feasible as well.

*4. we could even collectively purchase games to add to the library. users that contributed to the game get first dibs on checking it out. the order could be decided by how much they contributed or by some other means.

*5. a user willing to share his game with the rest of the community would make one post per game marking it available. if multiple copies of a game are available they would each have their own post. 

*6. first come first serve. if i share resistance and john requests first i ship to john. when joe requests for the game, john ships to joe, and so on. if the game becomes stagnant for a while, whoever had it last holds on to it until someone wants it, or s/he can ship it to the original owner. 

*7. confirmation numbers are required for all shipping so we can be sure no one tries to rip off the community. in the US, shipping confirmation is only 70 cents i think.

*8. by checking out a game, you agree that you will be able to ship it to the next person on the list. this means you can afford it and have the time to do so. 

*9. i think 4-6 wk is reasonable for a checked out game. any longer you have to ship to the next person on the list and put your name back on. 

that is all i have come up with. please comment and let me know if i'm crazy, what your ideas may be, or whatever. 

EDIT:

i have created the subreddit. /r/gamelibrary

it is set to private right now while i work on the faq/rules. 

please add more suggestions ideas. also, if you are interested in being a moderator let me know. i'll need help with this. a little nervous about going live with this. 

in the beginning at least, it will be approved members only. things will go a little slow, but it will help keep control of who is participating. this will hopefully prevent anyone trying to get one over us.

r/gamelibrary is temporarily available to the public to move the discussion over their and let gameswap do what it does best.

What do they look like on your screen?  

I'd also like to get some conversation around how everyone is searching for trades.  Do you use these new tags to search by platform?  Do you use the ""search reddit"" bar near the top right?  Or do you use the green ""browse trades"" button in the sidebar?  Did you even know that you CAN search???

I don't really have my collection typed out so it would help if you would just post the games you are willing to trade. Ill also take NES accessories too.

###NOTE: I will RES tag you as having requested the switch, and you are only allowed this one switch.  This is your **only switch for the blue tier**. 

As mentioned in the other post (linked above) you have a choice between the new version, and the 8-bit version at the red and green tier, which must be mentioned in your /r/mushroomkingdom post for those selected tiers. 


###Lastly - keep this thread free of outside chatter, 

It should be for 8-bit requests only.  If you want the 8-bit version of the blue mushroom (and you currently have the default blue mushroom) please reply with ""switch me please."" (I'll be ctrl+f ing that phrase - I'll probably find it if it's not that phrase, but it might take longer.)

My game got destroyed by an industrial press.. or something [PICS],AustinS,14,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/fri1t/gameswap_i_need_your_help_does_anyone_know/,"I entered into a trade with pillage and sent him NBA Jam immediately.  Well, I have a PM in my box tonight from pillage showing that my game was destroyed by some insane machine.  He originally thought I was just a crazed maniac who sent him a game after shoving a drill through it, but I promise that was not the case.  He later discovered that you could see where this machine went through both the padded mailer (bought at USPS), the dvd case, and the game itself.  What evil game eating machine are they using?!

So, I really don't want to re-purchase the game, but I don't really have much recourse at this point.  I'm hoping that someone knows someone that works at USPS and might be able to get this insured.  It was sent via first class mail (as suggested by the teller), if that makes a difference.  I also used delivery confirmation.

I've already contacted USPS but have not heard anything.  I'm assuming they will say shove-it.

Want to be awesome and the envy of everyone in this thread who doesn't read OP?  When confirming a trade, simply type this: `[](/confirmed)` and you'll have everyone wondering how you worked your magic. 


Post your successful trades here and confirm them! If you recently posted in the [previous successful trade thread](http://redd.it/18nxh7) just have it confirmed it over there. We'll watch that thread and assign shrooms as needed.

When making a successful trade post please provide a link to the thread (specifically the comment) where you and your trade partner initiated and conducted the deal. Obviously details such as addresses and real names should be handled via Private Messages, but negotiating the trade should be all in the open.

Also, if you are getting your blue mushroom, please indicate which mushroom you would like (8bit or HD). If you at any time you would like to switch your shroom look post in [this thread](http://redd.it/u3qqc). Please note that you only get one switch per tier of mushroom so choose wisely.

If you are at 10 or 20 (or more!) confirmed successful trades make a post over at /r/mushroomkingdom with links to each confirmation to get your respective shroom!

If you have any questions be sure to read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq) and if you still have questions [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameswap) and we'll do our best to answer them.

Please wait a week before messaging the mods about receiving your mushroom. We're busy individuals and sometimes stuff slips through the cracks. Also, if you're looking to get your blue mushroom don't post to mushroomkingdom. We assign blue mushrooms via this thread. 

As always, free upvotes for those that confirm their trades (both sides have to confirm!).

Please remember to include a link to the thread where you initiated the swap. Your trade won't count as confirmed unless you can provide a link to the original offer.

Also, take note that I won't babysit your confirmations. If you format it wrong, I won't be the one to tell you, though other mods may be nicer. Please be sure to include everything (the link to the negotiations and your trade partner's name).

If you have a game that I like, I'd certainly rather have an original version or CE version, but I'm just fine with a Greatest Hits version if it's something I want to play as opposed to collect.  I only have a few specifics that I'm looking for, so I'm really looking to check out lists.  I'm constantly shifting my attention to other games (damn gamer ADD) so you never know what will really catch my eye!

Everything on this list is potentially up for trade.  If I own it, and there is absolutely no way I'm trading it, it isn't listed here.  Pretty straight forward on availability.  The more asterisks, the harder it is for me to let go of that game.  I'm always willing to trade, so here is a guide to what the asterisks mean to me:  

1= No hesitation.  This game is absolutely up for trade.  
2= I like it, but I'm most probably done with it.  Still absolutely up for trade.  
3= I'm just as willing to keep it as I am willing to trade it.  
4= Most likely still being played in my house or just a game that I *LOVE* owning.  
5= Probably in my backlog and not necessarily looking to trade, but if the price is right...  

**FYI** - I LOVE RPG's.  They're by far, my favorite genre.  If you have a RPG not listed here, I very well may be interested in it.  Shoot me an offer and let's see what we can do!   So, without further adieu, here's the goods!:

**Games that I'm looking for**

Condition is an important factor for any Zelda game or disc-based game I'm wanting, but not as much for the carts. I'm also more willing to trade for carts that are not CIB.

Here is my collection, this is every game i own, so in part some are harder to obtain than others, but Everything is obtainable, with the right price. It may take a game I have been looking for, for ages.
'

NOTE: Not listed in the Document, I also own the Streetfighter IV tournament edition fightstick, in the box. (20th anniversary), XBOX 360 for a good offer, I could part with it.

Some particular things I really want.

Rpgs

Tales of Destiny, 1 and 2

All games!

Games in a series I own, but am missing a particular one.

Collector's editions.

Current Gen Games

Shadows of the Damned? something like that on ps3

But seriously, RPG's i do not own, I will cream my self over.

Suikoden II is up for grabs, but I do want to state to get suikoden 2 off of me, Its gonna take a couple of decently priced games, or 1 game of the same price, If there are 10 $15 or whatever, I am likely not to give it up.


I will respond to all offers, but I do fall behind if i am asleep or etc. Please allow for some time, if I am swamped to get offers out.

edit: if anyone offers earthbound, they can probably have my first born child. Just saying.

edit2: May also be in the market for an atari 2600

Sorry for the spreadsheet but once you see it you will understand why. Tried to keep it in somewhat descending generation order from left to right. Sheets 1 and 2 are my have lists, currently sheet 3 is a more specific want list but that will move as I update. The document will be updated at some point this weekend to include many more retro titles(nes, genesis, sega cd, 3DO, gba, gameboy color, gameboy, gamegear and atari). As for my wants, I'm partial to JRPGs, Shmups and Fighting games on every system. As far as consoles go, I'm looking for a Vita, 3DS and possibly a wifi enabled 360. The only thing I'm not interested in is sports titles. If we agree on a trade and you are getting something from a system that I have a sports title on, don't be alarmed if I toss it in as a bonus. Use it for trade bait in the future!

I will be more than happy to inspect and in some cases clean anything you ask about. The collection is vast and some of these things haven't been played in years. I work a M-F 9-6(est) so please be patient on requested photos.

**Update**
Added a few more SNES titles, some NES and some sega carts.

**NEW LIST, SAME OLD JUNK.  There are some changes, however, such as:**  

* **Window shopping music!** (see above)
* **New quips for most games!** (because even if you don't want anything, I can at least amuse you like the dancing monkey with a fez that I am...)
* **Modified WANT priorities!**  (now with 100% more retro opportunities)

I use a typical asterisk system where less means easier to get.  The range goes from zero asterisks (aka, ""Fox, get this guy off me!"") to four (aka, ""MY PRECIOUS!"").

If a game isn't in nearly perfect condition, I'll point out below how it isn't.  All of my games, even the worn ones, work unless specified in the comments section.  And as always, pics are available upon request.  Just the games, though; no pics of me.  Creeps.

I'm pretty sure shipping costs from the US to Canada have raised, so make sure you are comfortable with them before offering, as it'd pretty much kill low valued trades. I have no problem on my side however.

I have 1 of 2 3DS systems up for trade, but not both, and possibly none. It wouldn't be impossible for me to transfer Ambassador if you don't want to pay for it, and we have come to an agreement. I'm also thinking about possibly trading a system for a Japanese 3DS.

All games are working and complete in box (CiB) unless stated otherwise, can provide pictures upon request.

So its been a little while since I threw up my list in a top post. I'm looking for Skyrim at the moment, and if you have a disc only copy for 360, that's fine since I already have all the stuff that goes with it. As always, I'm willing to listen to any/every offer you have. I'm partial to N64 cartridges, I'm only halfway to a full set and **need your help** to complete it

I'll throw a bunch of things up that I think may stir a little interest, and you can always take a look at my google doc [right here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiHA3uorGkUWdGFNcU9id2syQlRZZ3BnVXY3aE05eXc#gid=5). Its tabbed by console at the bottom. Other than the big N64 list, most of everything else is available. As time permits, I'll be adding things that haven't made it on there yet, so please check back. It should be 100% updated by 10PM tonight 1/19

So let's get to it! Assume games are CIB unless otherwise specified

It's been rarely used, still has all original cables, and has a Wired Controller (which is preferred to wireless due to its ability to be a PC gamepad).

I also have the original box, if that makes a difference. It will probably be more trouble than it's worth to ship it in because I doubt it would fit all of the games and accessories.

Everything should be up to date and available unless there is an (*) or strike through next to the game for a pending trade. I'm mainly looking for RPG, Action-Adventure, Platformer, Arcade Shooter, and odd titles for each system. If you posted in one of my other threads and I didn't respond -- I apologize and will try to get to them this time around. Some of the items with * will fall through as not all negotiations are successful, but it would likely delay finalization of the trade if one of those items are picked.

This list will have eventually have Genesis, 32x, SMS, and Saturn items added in later once I round them all up and get them into the sheet.

I am on a pretty tight budget right now, not food or rent tight, but very little extra cash. 
I'd like to play some indie games on Steam including:

Bastion

Cthulu saves the World / Breath of Death pack- Got, thank you Doctor_teh

Runespell. 

Edit: due to a high number of people sending me mail offering other steam games outside the ones listed I will say that I'll take almost any steam game i don't yet own in exchange for one of the x-box games listed below, but Im going to give priority to the three mentioned above.

The obvious choice would be to sell my x-box 360 games and buy these indie games off steam, but I can't bring myself to sell my collection off, so instead I'm going to give them away here and hope that someone will find it in their heart to give a code for any of the three above games however this is NOT NECESSARY to get one of the games i have to give.

Now what everyone wants to see, the game's I'm giving away (all for the x-box 360): 

Blue Dragon (a personal Fav, if you havn't played it you really should) 

Dragon Age Origins 

Fallout 3 GOTY edition 

Fallout NV 

Halo 3 ODST 

Two Worlds (Not as terrible as everyone says, especially for free) 

Final Fantasy 13 

Eternal Sonata 

Lost Odyssey

All you need to do to win is send me a msg with your home address and the game you want so i can mail it to you, and if you want to send me a code for one of the above all the better.



Edit: WHAO that was a huge influx of mail, if i don't respond right away don't lose hope, I'll give away anything i havn't traded in about 48 hours, i need to get paid before i can pay for the postage. 

Will update both posts as i give the games away, and preference will have to be given to people from the gameswap subreddit who have steam codes.

DA:O has a new home with Commodoreer, thank you for the steam code my fine fellow redditor.

Fallout: NV and Blue Dragon are going to Doctor_teh, thank you for the steam code good sir.

Fallout 3 and ODST are going to Kjew, thank you for the steam code!


Edit 2:

Wow awesome, all the games I asked for have already been traded to me, so here's what's left:

Two Worlds (didn't see that coming)

FF13

Eternal Sonata

Lost Odyssey


I'm going to leave this up for Another 24ish hours then select 4 winners, I'll msg you in the order I random you and you get to pick what game you want from what I have left.

As you can imagine I would love to be in America right now. The closest American Best Buy to me is a 5 hour drive, and wouldn't be worth my time or in gas money.

I apologize if this is not in the rules of /gameswap, but I thought this is a great community to find someone to help me out.

**EDIT!!** A few people are worried about payment. I am well aware of the fact you have to pay cash for this and shipping probably won't be the cheapest on a package this heavy, but I will cover both with either games I own, or I can buy you a game you want or if it comes down to it, paypal.

So, I propose that in addition to FAQ, [Lebal] should also add a link to ""The Blacklist"" --- however, there's no need to post an entire address. Just use username, if known, and the city and state.

This way we could check this list for ""banned"" reddit accounts. But also, if the city/state matches a new trade we're about to make -- ONLY THEN, would we be inclined to message the Mods with the full address to see if that's the reddit user (with a new name) blacklisted.

Your trade won't count as confirmed unless you provide all of these things. If your account is not at least 3 months old I cannot assign you a blue mushroom.

To see an example of how to correctly confirm a trade, see this image: http://i.imgur.com/rDRXxYl

When confirming a trade, please link to the **comment** where you or your trade partner initiated the trade. Take [my post](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1cgkdj/successful_trade_thread_started_april_16_2013/c9nlcca?context=3) for example. I linked to where I made an offer on \_deffer_'s post. This is easier for me because I don't have to scour the entire thread for where you and your trade partner discussed your swap.

Want to be awesome and the envy of everyone in this thread who doesn't read OP?  When confirming a trade, simply type this: `[](/confirmed)` and you'll have everyone wondering how you worked your magic. 

Post your successful trades here and confirm them! If you recently posted in the [previous successful trade thread](http://redd.it/1dn7m8) just have it confirmed it over there. We'll watch that thread and assign shrooms as needed.

Also, if you are getting your blue mushroom, please indicate which mushroom you would like (8bit [](/blue8) or HD [](/blue)). If you at any time you would like to switch your shroom, post in [this thread](http://redd.it/18etfz). Please note that you only get one switch per tier of mushroom so choose wisely.

If you are at 10 or 20 (or more!) confirmed successful trades make a post over at /r/mushroomkingdom with links to each confirmation to get your respective shroom!

If you have any questions be sure to read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq) and if you still have questions [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameswap) and we'll do our best to answer them.

If it has been seven days since you confirmed your swap and you still have not received your shroom, please message the moderators with a link to your confirmation post and we will help you get your shroom.

As always, free upvotes for those that confirm their trades (both sides have to confirm!).

Keep up the good work gameswappers!",,False,,t5_2rbm7,False,,oredshroom,True,t3_1ez03t,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1ez03t/successful_trade_thread_started_may_24_2013/,moderator

I've got a red 3DS XL up for swap. I've had it since launch day, and it's already been registered with Club Nintendo.


The condition of the system is mostly good, but here's the breakdown:


- Light scratch marks on top screen due to it rubbing on the plastic from the bottom housing when closed and in my pocket

- Few scratches on the touch screen, one somewhat big, but I don't notice them that much in the middle of a game unless I use the stylus

- Outside housing appears to be completely scratch/scuff free


Included are:

- Red 3DS XL (includes box, manuals, AR cards, 2GB SD card, and AC adapter)

- Carry case (big enough to hold 3DS and a few games)

- Circle Pad Pro XL (circle pad itself is scratched up really badly, I used it to replace the pad on another used 3DS)

- 3DS stand (the one that came bundled with Kid Icarus)

- Car charger

- XL Charging cradle

- Pokemon  stylus (if you want it, otherwise it'll probably be tossed)


All I want in return for all of this is a regular Midnight Purple 3DS, but if no one comes forward with one but offers another color, I may consider it. As long as the condition isn't worse than the system I'm offering for trade, I'll have no problem accepting it. I hope I did everything properly in my post, wouldn't want to screw up on my first go at this. Thanks for stopping to look, and happy trading everyone.


Edit: Just to clarify, I'm getting to each person who offered to trade in order. It's just taking a little bit of time because not everyone is able to get back to me right away.

Preface before viewing list: I'm willing to send/receive **Paypal/Amazon credit** to balance out a trade if it comes up through natural negotiations

[314 confirmed trades](http://redd.it/144q4o)

Everything listed here is available for trade. However, some things will require a pretty decent offer to touch. I don't value my games based on anything more than my desire to play them(this is technically my 'backlog' if you want to call it that) and how much I have invested in them. If I want what you're offering more, I'll probably be into it. If you think you are proposing a fair trade, you're probably right if basing solely on average values from a flawed resource(yeah, VGPC can go fly a kite, its all bogus information).

[If you would rather look at my Google doc, this is the link to it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiHA3uorGkUWdGFNcU9id2syQlRZZ3BnVXY3aE05eXc#gid=5). 

###However, please note that some things on the Google Doc are not available for trade. These will be marked in red



Some of these things will be going on eBay pretty soon, so if you want something let me know!

1= No hesitation.  This game is absolutely up for trade.  
2= I like it, but I'm most probably done with it.  Still absolutely up for trade.  
3= I'm just as willing to keep it as I am willing to trade it.  
4= Most likely still being played in my house or just a game that I enjoy owning.  
5= Probably in my backlog and not necessarily looking to trade, but if you have something specifically on my [W] list, we can chat.    

If you're interested in something but we're unable to agree on a trade, feel free to visit my [/r/Gamesell thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamesell/comments/1b6aup/usa_h_cosmo_black_3ds_pikachu_3ds_xl_tales_of/) and we can chat there if you're interested in buying.

Asterisks indicate games I am less willing to part with, but don't be afraid to make an offer! Two asterisks indicate games that I am currently playing, and it will take a very good offer to get those off of my hands.

Most of the games are complete in box with manuals, unless noted; GBA games aside.

I have a rarely used, **mint, like new condition** PlayStation Vita WiFi + 3G model that I rarely used. I don't play it much because of school now, so I figure why not sell it to someone who would enjoy it more than I would. When you receive it, I'll throw in these games:

* Persona 4: Golden (CiB)

* Assassin's Creed III: Liberation (CiB)

* Rayman Origins (actually has the case for Uncharted for Vita, if you actually want that)

Additionally, I have some accessories to go with it.

* PS Vita 4GB Memory Card

* Carrying Case (also holds games)

* AC Adapter w/ USB cable, manuals, box

Preferred games are God of War (any), Uncharted (any), or other Sony exclusives. I also like 3D games since I just got a 3DTV. Extra controllers are a huge plus. PayPal to even out the trade is even better.

**However.**

Do you have a fair offer? Is it 30 GameBoys? Some rare games? Modern consoles? ~~Sexual favors?~~ Shoot me an offer anyway! I love offers! PayPal to even out your trade is even better if you want to upgrade your anything to a Vita!

A warning, it may be TL/DR for you, so if its easier just use [my google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AiHA3uorGkUWdFVwS1hoZGpFc0U1RE8yTDVKdTMwTVE). Within the google doc, anything special about the game is noted(including condition if its worth mentioning)

As far as wants go, I'm really just looking for offers. I'd like a few of the HD collections for both PS3 and Xbox 360. I'd love any consoles that I don't have games listed for.(Specifically a Gamecube and Wii, but would also love a Saturn, Jaguar, 3D0, Atari, Coleco, whatever else you got and are willing to offer).  Anything with a strikethru means the there is already an agreed upon trade, but if its still there its not completed yet and I will accept backup offers since I'm well aware that s&amp;^% happens sometimes. 

I'm into anything gaming related, blu rays, potentially comics. I'll try to piece together a specific wants list as I get time. I'd love to get my hands on first party NES and N64 controllers, SNES dust covers if you have any, and boxes/manuals for games listed as disc/cart only. 

If you have a heavy item(console, bunch of cartridges, whatever) I am willing to go in a little bit on shipping just to even out the swap.

Just a little note, please be aware that my workplace does not allow me access to google documents during the daytime. My current schedule is 5a-4p EST, so anything google doc based sent during that time will not be able to be addressed until the evening. 

Just as another little note, games in bold will take you to overtrade to get, they are favorites and they ***won't*** go quietly. italized games are on their way from someone else. Once I receive and test, they will change to plain text

If you scroll down the sidebar you can still see a comparison of the blue 8-bit icon and the 8-bit rainbow icon.  Which do you guys like better.  

We are going to stick with ONLY using mushrooms... with the exception of the SuperStar.  If someone can create two other mushrooms... (Silver and Gold) we could actually remove the SuperStar as well and truly have ONLY mushroom flair (which I think I would prefer).  

Between the 8-bit and the new style higher-res icons... which does the community prefer?! 

I can't think of any better way to really track this... So I'm going to post two comments... please upvote the appropriate set that you prefer so we can have a quasi-poll.  (feel free to downvote the icons you don't like if you feel the need to off-set the comment karma).

Hi there!

I have a lightly used [White GP2X Caanoo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAANOO). [You can see it in my pictures here](http://imgur.com/a/kJwfN). It is in perfect condition: No scratches, screen is nice and bright, battery is good -- well, it has had the battery life of a smart phone since day one but it's consistent at 4-6 hours of gaming. Just an estimate, mind you. I'm including the charger/USB cable and an SD card-adapter that has a 16GB MicroSD card in it. 

I'm open to suggestions in terms of offers. I'm interested in:

* Nintendo 3DS (obviously an imbalanced trade, so we can discuss me providing cash to supplement)
* Atari Jaguar 
* Atari Lynx
* Vectrex
* Good quality Nintendo DS games (ie. the stuff game stores still sell for $20+)
* Apple app store credit 
* Amazon Kindle
* Whatever else you can think of

Thanks for your interest -- hope we can make a trade!

So, I figured this would be my best bet, outside of selling stuff and lose some money on the transactions.  

First the haves:

* Sega Dreamcast w/ proper hookups, 4 controllers (one 3rd party) 2 VMUs

* Games include D2, NBA 2k1, Jet Grind Radio, Power Stone, Power Stone 2, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Grandia II, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Resident Evil 3, Soul Calibur
* Note that some games do not come with original case or art.  Will specify upon request

* Black DS Lite with charger
* Games include Pokemon White, Pokemon Heart Gold, Golden Sun Dark Dawn, Chrono Trigger, Legend of Zelda Spirit Tracks, Final Fantasy Tactics A2, Final Fantasy XII Revenant Wings, Ace Attorney Apollo Justice, Dragon Quest IV, Dragon Quest IX,  Dragon Quest Rocket Slime, Suikoden Tierkreis, Megaman Starforce Leo, Mystery Dungeon Shiren the Wanderer, Advance Wars Dual Strike, Lunar Dragon Song, Jam Sessions
* I will trade games alone, and I prefer to trade away the Dreamcast over the DS

Onto the wants:

* Last fat model of Xbox 360.  Mine is that model, so I don't have a slim hard drive. 
* Games for it that came out starting this fall.  Last thing I bought was Skyrim.  Obviously not looking to trade for games without a system.
* Skyward Sword + a motion plus controller/accessory.  
* Other Wii Offers
* Whatever else you can think of
* No steam offers
* Only dealing with extremely trusted members for trades of higher value.  ",,False,,t5_2rbm7,False,,redshroom,True,t3_omg5k,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/omg5k/usa_h_dreamcast_w_games_ds_lite_w_games_w_older/,

I picked up Fallout 3: GOTY off of Steam a little while ago. As you may or may not know, it used Games for Windows Live, and so when I logged in from my Steam account, I realized that I already had a copy of the game associated with my Windows Live account, so I still have an unused CD key that came with my Steam copy. It will work if you enter it in the Games for Windows Live account, not sure about Steam.

* Donkey Kong

Two Gameboy soft carrying cases

There's a huge stack of ps2 games in a closet that I need to break out but I need to do some digging first.

I also have a Sega Genesis and a Super Nintendo with 2 controllers. I'll get more info on these two because they are in a box. Near the box there is a spider. I need to have the boyfriend come over and kill the spider before I go near that box. I will post pictures of the Sega and Nintendo also when I get them out of the box and will see if they have wires with them. I had a box of old school games for both systems also but there are spiders in the general area. I need a flamethrower. 

But in reality all I am looking for is 2 oldschool psp's hopefully in decent condition (I don't care if you dropped it a couple of times and theres some scratches on it, who hasn't dropped things in the past?).

If you want a lot of things maybe throw in a Monster Hunter game for the PSP &gt;_&gt; That's really why I'm getting them. :D

EDIT-- Just found an unopened CE Warhammer Online. I'll never touch this again.

I'm in charge of the programming for [gamervision.com](http://www.gamervision.com/trades) and I've just built a game trading system that you can use to swap games. It's all completely free right now and we'll never charge for things we let you do for free. (If we build it as free, it'll stay free.)

I'm still working on it heavily, but I would love if you guys can try it out and let me know what you think, most of the stuff that's up there to trade is mine right now.

To make it work, you'll have to sign up for an account and add all the games you want to trade to your library. Mark them as ""Make me an offer"" and that'll make them available to others. If you know what you want to get, you can list your game on the swap and sell, but if you do that then you won't get trade offers on it.

Let me know what you guys think, I'm trying to make it more obvious that you can do these trades on there.

Almost all the stuff available for trade on there is mine, but I'll be happy to trade with you guys if you make me an offer.

I'm still working on the karma system, so we don't have a way to track good traders vs bad ones yet.

I'm a little nervous, but excited to see if you guys like this.

Some of these items are for sale on other sites, so they might go quickly

[342 confirmed trades](http://redd.it/144q4o) and 7 more in process, so no worries, mmkay?

Everything listed here is available for trade. However, some things will require a pretty decent offer to touch. I don't value my games based on anything more than my desire to play them(this is technically my 'backlog' if you want to call it that) and how much I have invested in them. If I want what you're offering more, I'll probably be into it. If you think you are proposing a fair trade, you're probably right if basing solely on average values from a flawed resource(yeah, VGPC can go fly a kite, its all bogus information). 

I have extra consoles too, including a slim and a chunky PS2, and SNES modded to play SFC games, Gamecube, NES, GBA SP, a Wii with wiimotes + nunchuks(would split up), and random controllers for everything

Also have a **Kinect** that can go. Will toss in Kinect Adventures. 

If we were working on a deal in the past and communication stopped for whatever reason, hit me back and I may be interested. I get a lot of messages, so sometimes they go unnoticed and I do apologize for that

Pictures of anything/everything are available upon request

Want to be awesome and the envy of everyone in this thread who doesn't read OP?  When confirming a trade, simply type this: `[](/confirmed)` and you'll have everyone wondering how you worked your magic. 


Post your successful trades here and confirm them! If you recently posted in the [previous successful trade thread](http://redd.it/1i4d2p) just have it confirmed it over there. We'll watch that thread and assign shrooms as needed.

When making a successful trade post please provide a link to the thread (specifically the comment) where you and your trade partner initiated and conducted the deal. Obviously details such as addresses and real names should be handled via Private Messages, but negotiating the trade should be all in the open.

Also, if you are getting your blue mushroom, please indicate which mushroom you would like (8bit or HD). If you at any time you would like to switch your shroom look post in [this thread](http://redd.it/u3qqc). Please note that you only get one switch per tier of mushroom so choose wisely.

If you are at 10 or 20 (or more!) confirmed successful trades make a post over at /r/mushroomkingdom with links to each confirmation to get your respective shroom!

If you have any questions be sure to read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/faq) and if you still have questions [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgameswap) and we'll do our best to answer them.

Please wait a week before messaging the mods about receiving your mushroom. We're busy individuals and sometimes stuff slips through the cracks. Also, if you're looking to get your blue mushroom don't post to mushroomkingdom. We assign blue mushrooms via this thread. 

Please remember to include a link to the thread where you initiated the swap. Your trade won't count as confirmed unless you can provide a link to the original offer.

**Also, take note that I** ***will*** **babysit your confirmations as best as I can. If you format it wrong, expect to be the subject of ridicule and humiliation. I will probably be the one to tell you, though other mods may be nicer. Please be sure to include everything (the link to the negotiations, the items involved, and your trade partner's name).**

Looking for a PS Vita and .hack//G.U. Vol 3 mostly.**   

Everything on this list is potentially up for trade. If I own it, and there is absolutely no way I'm trading it, it isn't listed here. Pretty straight forward on availability. The more asterisks, the harder it is for me to let go of that game. I'm always willing to trade, so here is a guide to what the asterisks mean to me: 

1= No hesitation. This game is absolutely up for trade.
2= I like it, but I'm most probably done with it. Still absolutely up for trade.
3= I'm just as willing to keep it as I am willing to trade it.
4= Most likely still being played in my house or just a game that I LOVE owning.  Will likely take some specific wants or rare items/games.    
5= Probably in my backlog and not necessarily looking to trade, but if you have something specifically on my MED/HIGH [W] list, we can chat. 

**NOTE: The number of asterisks I assign to a game by no means denotes the monetary value that I place on a game. Only my willingness to trade said game. I don't expect to rip anyone off just because I have 5 asterisks next to a game, nor do I plan on just giving away any 1 asterisk games. I try to be fair and expect the same.**

Game | my rating of love from 1 to 5 snowflakes | My notes
:--|:--:|:--

Good? Good.

Regardless of how many snowflakes a game has, don't be afraid to offer me something. Everything in this list is on the table.

LET'S GO BY AGE OF CONSOLE OH WHAT FUN



[](/snes)

All of these are cart only I'm so sry pls forgive?

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Star Fox |**| SUPER FX. The label and cart are in excellent condition.
Frogger |**| Who is that famous guy with the Frogger addiction? Seinfeld? Kramer? Label is slightly scuffed on the top. Can you believe Konami was involved? I CAN.
Tetris Attack |***|This is fucking awesome. Walk into the ^^de scrip ^^tion like whatup I gotta big mark, cart scuffed up I swap games in /r/gameswap 
Street Fighter II |**| Want some poundcake? Great condition on this cart.
Mortal Kombat II |**| Cart is in pristine condition, this is one of the SUPER rare ones where they put a 'K' in 'Combat' instead of a 'C'. Also, dragon with lightning right there on the front of the cart. What more do you want? I also have the manual! How groovy!
Super Gameboy|***|It's in great condition. Best way to play the gen one Pokemon games, by far.

[](/n64)

Cart only again, is that all you ever think about you pig?

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Mia Hamm Soccer 64 |*| [Get this one for the picture of Mia on the cart alone. Breathtaking.](http://imgur.com/gallery/mp0WF7A) Sticker residue all up on this one.
Star Fox 64 |***| I do love me a flying fox. Cart has a few scuffs, but that won't stop you from kicking Andross' ass.
The Legend of Zelda: OoT |****| This one isn't in great condition: bottom of the label is whited out a bit, some asshole wrote 'M.F.H' on the front of the cart, There is a used game sticker on the side with someone else's name written over that... BUT THIS GAME IS GOOD SO I DON'T CARE.
Pokemon Stadium|****|Ekans Ring Toss is the 10th circle of hell, I am sure of it.

[](/ps1)

Some of these are actually CiB! Some aren't though. I swear we can get through this. Together.

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Mega Man Legends |*****| I love this game a lot. More than is logical. Disk is scratched but plays perfectly. I have the original case, but the front has a couple of cracks and the manual is missing. Doesn't hurt to make an offer!
Mega Man Legends 2 |*****| Same as above, except I don't have the original case anymore. What I do have is the finest jewel case money can buy.
Final Fantasy VIII |***| CiB! And in pretty good condition! Couple of cracks on the front of the box and a partially broken hinge on the back, but that won't stop a tenacious gamer like yourself. Leon is a badass.
Final Fantasy IX |****| This is my second favorite post-SNES FF game. Large crack on the front of the case but it is complete. Also it's the Greatest Hits version, which has a lovely red and green color scheme on the side. Charming.

[](/ps2)

More of these are CiB. Getting less grumpy now?

Pics for the Dot Hacks are [here.](http://imgur.com/a/PJQ1M)

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Front Mission 4 |**| I like games like this. CiB! Excellent Condition! WOO!
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets |***| This game was actually freaking awesome. It was kinda a sandbox deal, you could do side missions and shit. No manual. I'm sorry.
Final Fantasy X |****| My favorite post-SNES FF game. Greatest hits edition, CiB and a sticker on the box. DON'T LET THAT STOP YOU. HA HA HA HA. 
The Godfather: The Game |**| Pretty fun for what it is, a classier version of GTA. Limited Edition! CiB minus the decorative sleeve it came with.
Kingdom Hearts|*****| Love this one too. Black Label, good condition on the case. Disc has several light scratches but won't affect game play. Feels invested here.
Kingdom Hearts II |*****| Same as above. THE BEST GAMES EVER PEOPLE. **I also have the strategy guide** for this one, but there is some water damage ^^definitelynotfrommytearsokguys
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas |***| Fun game, wholesome family entertainment. CiB black label, even has the map!
Guitar Hero, II, III, and 80's |***| I've also got a couple of the guitars. They are all black label and CiB
MGS3: Substance|****|CiB. One of my top 5 favorite game themes of all time. YES MGS2 IS UP THERE TOO.
Dot hack: Infection |****| CiB in the black label case. These games sure got popular after they stopped making them, eh?
Dot hack: Outbreak |****| CiB! BLACK LABEL! WHAT A FIND. 

[](/gamecube)

Only three here, and all are CiB! 

**I also have a purple GameCube console and a controller that I could part with for the right trade.**

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles |***| I never really got into it, but then again I never really gave it a chance. Black label!
Metroid Prime |***| This one was fun back in the day. Black label with a sticker on it (GameCrazy lol)
Sonic Adventure 2 Battle |***| Really fun memories here, Chaos are the cutest. Player's Choice box... not that that matters, right? Right?

[](/xbox)

Some CiB, some not. That's just how it goes man.

**I have an original Xbox and several controllers that I could part with in a trade as well.**

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
LotR: RotK | ** | If you can figure out the title from the abbreviation, good for you! No manual.
Fable | ** | Best RPG ever, amirite? CiB.
Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory | ** | This was a fun game, you could make a guard fall off a treadmill at one point. Platinum Hits, CiB.
Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow | ** | Also fun! CiB.
Star Wars: KotOR | **** | Never finished it :( CiB.
PGR 2/XBOX Arcade | ** | Geometry Wars! No manual.
Star Wars Battle Front II|****|CiB. Mos Eisley, need I say more?



[](/360)

This is the system I do most of my playing on now. Would like Bioshock Infinite... JUST SAYING OK. All CiB and good condition unless I say otherwise. I take care of games better now that I'm older.

**I have a Halo 3 Special Edition Xbox 360 CiB except for the hard drive if you would like to trade something for that.**

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Dishonored |****| Love this game, fucking awesome atmosphere. CiB!
Halo Reach, 3, 4 |***| These are good games, don't care if they are similar. All CiB! Griffball, ftw.
Skyrim |****| What a game. DRAGONS AND NORDS AND SHIT.
Portal 2 |****| They said we couldn't afford moon rocks. Bought them anyway. Put'em in the gel. Turns out, moon rock is pure poison!
Forza 4 |***| Autovista with Jeremy Clarkson is the reason to get this one.
Borderlands 2 |****| [THEY SAY THERE'S A GARILLION GUNS IN THIS GAME BUT MORE LIKE AN ORANGUTAN FUCKING DICK MILLION.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLPcqnQXk9w)
Fallout NV |***| Love this one too. Fallout is just the coolest thing to me. 
CoD MW2, MW3 |***| I actually kinda like the story a little.... hello?
GTA 4 |**| COUSIN NIKO LET'S GO BOWLING EH?
Final Fantasy 13 |***| MORE LIKE FINAL HALLWAY XIII AMIRITE. Platinum Edition.
Left 4 Dead, I &amp; II |**| Anything Valve does is excellent.
Orange Box |*****| Possibly the greatest gaming collection ever. Portal is just amazing. TF2 is goooood. And Half Life 2 and the episodes! Just great.
CoD Black Ops |***| Possibly the most mature group of online gamers in history.
Bioshock 2 |***| I loved this one just as much as the first, and you can't take that shit from me.
Fallout 3|****|[TUNNEL SNAKES RULE. WE'RE THE TUNNEL SNAKES. THAT'S US. AND WE RULE.](http://www.tunnelsnakes.com/)
Injustice: Gods Among Us|****|This one gets me all tingly inside. 
Two Worlds II|**|CiB, 2 Disk Collectors Edition. I don't even recall playing this game, but the box sure is shiny!

[](/wii)

All CiB and almost mint unless I tell you different.

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Mario Strikers: Charged |***| This game is freaking awesome. Platinum Hits, seriously mint condition.
WarioWare: Smooth Moves |***| This is a good one too! Less than mint on the disc. 
Guitar Hero Aerosmith |**| Have a guitar too. I also have a big 10 inch... record of a band that plays the blues.
Super Mario Galaxy |***| Amazing game. That's all I got.
Super Smash Bros Brawl |****| Used sticker on the case, but it's pristine. Love these games.
Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess |****| Great condition, great game. First one I got for the Wii, even!
Super Mario Sluggers|***|It's in! I hope this is as good as Strikers. 

**Handhelds!**

Again by order of system age for fun.

[](/gb)

All of these are going to be cart only.

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Pokemon Red/Yellow |*****| Carts in OK condition. The battery in Yellow is good, the one in Red needs replaced.
Pokemon Pinball |**| No battery cover.

[](/gba)

Again, all cart only.

**I have a GBA and an SP, I'll part with one but not both.**

||||
:--:|:--:|:--
Metroid: Zero Mission |**| Great game here folks.
Megaman Battle Network 3 White |**| These games were fun as shit! No one ever believes me though.
Golden Sun: The Lost Age |***| Golden Sun never got the recognition it deserved. AND THE LITTLE DJINS WERE SO FUCKING ADORABLE. **I also have the strategy guide for Golden Sun and Golden Sun Lost Age, it's one book!**
Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories |***| I personally like card battlers, so there. 
Classic NES Series: Castlevania |**| What a classic NES game! They should make a series of such games.
Pokemon Ruby |****| Battery needs replaced, but you know what won't need replaced? My memories with this game. HOW BOUT THAT.

[](/ds)

All CiB unless the matrix has a glitch.

**I AM LOOKING FOR A 3DS. Send me an offer if you have one!**

||||
:--:|:--:|:--

**SIDE NOTES/WANTS**

I have a couple of systems that I'm willing to part with, just ask if you're interested.

I'll take offers for any system I listed up there (minus the PSP), I like pretty much everything. I'm trying to build up a good DS collection at the moment, but I'll look at offers for anything with the same loving gaze.

**I would really like a 3DS.** I don't need the XL, I just want to start building a collection since I'll get one when X/Y comes out anyway.

I would also like **Metro: Last Light** if anyone has a spare copy to trade. Not expecting much there, but thought I would mention it!

Like everyone else on the planet, I would like a copy of **Bioshock: Infinite, 360 please**

Please tell me what you're interested in if you post. Don't just drop your list and ask if I see anything. 

While some people value their games/trades based on the quality of the game, I typically use the current market value of games. I normally use Gamestop to gauge the current price of used titles (minus a few bucks because GS is greedy). I also keep track of all current game sales and use those in my choices (whether the sale is to be used against me or for me). Just an FYI.

Make sure you are comfortable with shipping to Canada before making an offer.

My main interest is a Japanese 3DS system. I understand it is a long shot. If not, I have a relatively extensive list of wants at the bottom which I will stick to.

All games are working and complete in box (CiB) unless stated otherwise. I will provide pictures upon request.

Anyways, I am really looking to get NBA 2k13 but don't have much to trade in return. However, I do frequent the website [99gamers](http://99gamers.com/browse) which has plenty of games up for grabs (some pretty rare GameCube games also). I am willing to use up to 30 of my coins (equivalent to $30) to get a game or games of your choice for NBA 2k13. Just let me know what interests you and I'll get it.

Now there are a couple ways we could probably do this:

1. You pick a game, I'll buy it, receive it, then ship it to you once I receive it and inspect it. Also, if you see something that costs more than 30 coins but don't have an account, let me know if you wanna send me PayPal to cover the rest of the price for whatever you want and I'll get it for you.

2. If you have a 99gamers account (or want to make one), you could put your game for sale up there, I'll buy it, you'll receive the coins and pick the game out and order it yourself, obviously this is the quicker approach.

So either way, let me know what you wanna do and we'll do it. 

If you have any questions or concerns let me know. 

EDIT: For the those of you wondering why I don't just get NBA 2k13 on that website, it's because the only copy available belongs to a guy who has not logged in for a month and doesn't respond to my messages.",,False,,t5_2rbm7,1363188520.0,,greenshroom,True,t3_1a7w4w,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/1a7w4w/usa_h_games_equivalent_to_30_coins_on_99gamerscom/,

Note: I have my own subjective way of valuing games - I don't care about prices, but I know when I'm being taken advantage of. However, please don't be afraid to offer older games for newer games - I may make the trade.  To me, it's not about recouping the $60 I paid for Crysis, it's about being done with Crysis, and stretching that $60 into another gaming experience at the cost of shipping. I'm very ""flavor of the month"" with games - currently I'm into story heavy RPGs (Ni no blew my socks off, Persona 4 Golden eats up all my free time - looking for similar experiences.)


That said: up for trade:

\* Little Big Planet Karting includes a case and box art, but they are both non-retail. It's an HD-DVD case (red/maroon) and the box art is the cardboard sleeve from the console pack-in that I cut up to fit into the case. Kids ripped the sleeve which is why I needed to find an alternative - disc is fine.

Everything on this list is up for swap. The 360 items will be harder to get from me as I have just started to break into them. It would take a very good trade to get rid of some of them.

Always interested in PS3 offers and what is on my wants list. Offers for exclusives I don't have listed for 360 will definitely be considered. Always looking at Blu-ray movies as well.

Also selling the N64 if anyone is interested [in that route instead of swapping.](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamesell/comments/14j2js/usa_h_big_lot_of_both_n64_ps2_w_paypal/) Would prefer to sell it as a lot, not piece it out, but that's up for discussion.

Thanks ahead of time for looking.

Hello! Welcome to my first game swap!

**Here is what I have for offer**:

* Silent Hill: Downpour (Xbox 360).
* Resident Evil 6 (Xbox 360)
* Final Fantasy XIII (PS3 Greatest Hits)
* Dead Island (Xbox 360 Platinum Hits)

* I also have a DS Lite that doesn't turn on properly, and a first gen Xbox 360 that doesn't read disks (If you'd like it for parts, practicing fixing electronics or whatnot).

* I also have numerous Playstation 2, Gamecube, Game Boy and Sega Genesis games, if there is something you're looking for, feel free to let me know, and I'll check the collection.

**What I'm looking for**:

Well, really....offers! I'm not all that picky, and chances are, I might be able to find something that you have that I want.

The games that are currently released that I am currently looking for are:

* DMC: Devil May Cry (Xbox 360 or PS3)
* Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time (PS3)
* Devil May Cry HD Collection (Xbox 360 or PS3)
* Hitman: Absolution (PS3 or Xbox 360).
* Disney's Epic Mickey: The Power of Illusion (3DS)
* Fire Emblem: Awakening (3DS)
* Metal Gear Solid 3D: Snake Eater (3DS).

If it is within the rules, I am also willing to do a ""Swap now, get later"" deal, when the games I'm currently anticipating are released. They are the following:

* Bioshock: Infinite. (360)
* Castlevania Lords of Shadow: Mirror of Fate. (3DS)
* Tomb Raider (360 or PS3)

Hope we can make a deal!

Anything without a (CIB) next to it is just the cartridge/disc. I can give you a generic case for it though, if it is a disc. 4 stars means I basically won't trade it no matter what.

I am a gamer first and a collector second.  If you have a game that I like, I'd certainly rather have an original version or CE version, but I'm just fine with a Greatest Hits version if it's something I want to play as opposed to collect.  I only have a few specifics that I'm looking for, so I'm really looking to check out lists.  I'm constantly shifting my attention to other games (damn gamer ADD) so you never know what will really catch my eye!

Everything on this list is potentially up for trade.  If I own it, and there is absolutely no way I'm trading it, it isn't listed here.  Pretty straight forward on availability.  The more asterisks, the harder it is for me to let go of that game.  I'm always willing to trade, so here is a guide to what the asterisks mean to me:  

1= No hesitation.  This game is absolutely up for trade.  
2= I like it, but I'm most probably done with it.  Still absolutely up for trade.  
3= I'm just as willing to keep it as I am willing to trade it.  
4= Most likely still being played in my house or just a game that I *LOVE* owning.  
5= Probably in my backlog and not necessarily looking to trade, but if the price is right...  

**FYI** - I LOVE RPG's.  They're by far, my favorite genre.  If you have a RPG not listed here, I very well may be interested in it.  Shoot me an offer and let's see what we can do!   So, without further adieu, here's the goods!:

http://vgcollect.com/abell128 here is my profile to my collection, I have more in my collection, but I am typing it into a spreadsheet and will complete it and link it to you guys.

I also have a SMS and some xbox 360 and ps3 games i will have to update.


Here is the reason I am linking my collection, everything it can be had. But saying it would be easy or anything thats another story.

I also would entertain offers for trade of my 3ds system, with power cord.

I know what I have, so I would prefer no low ball offers. 

I also do not use VGPC, i use current ebay listings, because VGPC does not account for condition, etc.'

When the spreadsheet is finished, I will link it thru google docs.

Also interested in possibly CIB sega saturn or sega CD games, as I do not have many games for that.

Also. 

Anyone that has a strong want for a Sealed Majora's Mask collectors edition. I do have one.

Edit: At this time The following Items are off the possibility of trade, as I have already had people PM and confirm to ship the following.

Donkey Kong Classics


Starfox snes


Kingdom hearts 2

A quick rundown for my giant, hard to read chart - Everything is organized by system, then by game title. This is a complete list of everything I have, so it includes things I do and things I do not want to trade. Please look at column J for that information, but the Pro-Tip is almost everything that is not N64 (barring my load of N64 duplicates) is up for trade.

Also, column K has a list of prices, feel free to ignore them. They were for my benefit, but they are all outdated now, and I don't hold any hard or fast rules to prices.

[THE GIANT TRADE LIST](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArHDlTHKgs8qdEYyekMzU3RZU2FXdGpCZjI5SEtmOEE)

I'm looking to complete my N64 collection, so anything I'm missing, or anything that you may have in better condition than I have, I'm interested in.

Aside from that, a short list of what I really want:

* NFR/Not for Resale/Demo N64 carts

* Wideboy 64 (Yeah, I know that one is crazy)

* Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages (GBC)

* Gameboy E-Reader cards

* Unique and unusual gaming items

* [A set of the interesting colored controller in this picture (Extreme Green)](http://www.consolecolors.com/images/n64extremegreen.jpg)

* Any other rare N64 controllers

* [This Goldeneye 007 Official Nintendo Watch](http://imgur.com/E3eNP)

I hope the above gets you an idea of what I'd be interested in aside from the games. 

Also, I have a (I believe) CiB Sega CD, and a Genesis 2 with box (not complete) up for trade. For the boxed collectors, I have a handful of games, most are pictured either [here](http://i.imgur.com/XhvEm.jpg) or [here](http://i.imgur.com/gV6E8.jpg)

I make beadsprites. A lot of my friends have made requests and I trade them from there. Here are some examples of ones that are personally mine and/or I have already made for other people.

[Sorry for the poor quality. Not the beadsprites, the picture, lol.](http://i.imgur.com/Zw7By.jpg)

I will make these as offers. How this works with my friends...

You would offer something and ask for what you wanted made.

If I liked the trade I would tell you and give you a time in which it would take me to make them. Some I can hammer our in a day but sometimes I need to order colors or more beads. Usually takes 2-3 days. I would then give you a picture of the product and you would accept of deny it.

If you can think of a better way for this to work I'd be more than happy to hear it.

As far as what I like... Games! I'm a collector. I have a small bookshelf of games. I like the rare stuff like RPGs and oddities. But I also just collect stuff.

If you're offering something rarer I'd be more willing to provide bigger and better projects.

Thank you for reading my post. Hope you guys like the idea and me joining the community.

EDIT 7/10/12: Hey, I don't know if you guy read the other comments or not but I work for two days this week. I just finished one of them yesterday. So I'll get started on Wednesday.


EDIT 7/12/12: Just another update. I got picked up for a night of work last night (which got canceled, spent all day driving around.) And because it got canceled It's getting moved to today... I'll know later this evening.

Note:  Depending on the trade, I might need some help paying for shipping the Wii.  It really depends on the situation though.  Also, please indicate what you're willing to trade.  If you give me a big list and aren't willing to trade the majority of your games, then it'd be easier to just condense it to what you are willing to trade, right?  The price charting prices are a decent guide, but I don't strictly go by it.

MMOswap.,shoot2scre,9,3,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/sebnp/psa_trying_to_gauge_interest_on_a_new_subreddit/,"I have seen a few posts recently (in the Spam Filter) looking to swap games/beta keys/etc for in-game items/gold in various PC games and MMO's.  I'm curious if the community wants to see a subreddit dedicated to swapping either in-game items for other in-game items or in-game items for games.  Seemingly MMO's are pretty popular... I don't play them though... so if anyone thinks this is a good idea, has interest in seeing this sister-sub [/r/mmoswap](/r/mmoswap) become a reality or would like to help create it... please let me know by sharing your thoughts in the comments.  

---

My thoughts are simple... this could be a catch-all kind of subreddit.  It would allow people to put things up for trade in all the PC games that are not necessarily 'Steam' games but still PC related (and thus outside the logical scope of [/r/steamgameswap](/r/steamgameswap).    I know SGS still allows a lot of that stuff... so I'm not sure if [/r/mmoswap](/r/mmoswap) would fill a niche or not... which is why I want your input.  

I figure any LoL, WoW, SWTOR, Guild Wars, Runescape, swaps could go there.  We would also leave the subreddit open for swapping accounts, or anything PC related that isn't directly related to Steam.  Beta Keys, etc... would all be given the green light.  

Basically I want to know what the community thinks.  Do you guys like seeing those swaps here?  I know there aren't that many... but would you prefer if we directed those swaps elsewhere?  I just want some community feedback on this.  Afterall, we are only here to reflect the will of our close to 9,000 strong swappers... so please don't be shy... share with us your thoughts on this matter... OR ANY matter you care to talk about.  We are constantly trying to improve this place and we rely heavily on you guys for ideas and ways to make YOUR experience here that much better.

EDIT:  If anyone thinks or knows of a subreddit that I should cross-post this to, please let me know (or just post a link).  I'm at work so I can't spend too much time fiddling with this right now.  

[/r/MMOswap](/r/MMOswap) is up and active.  If you play MMO's or are interested in helping out/know CSS let me know.

Account was formerly a VIP account until I stopped playing it originally.  All VIP accounts drop to Premium and are Premium permanently, all the benefits are posted in the link above.  Unless you decide to reactivate the VIP.
I've done several MMORPG account trades on another reddit account of mine.  (Including World of Warcraft, RIFT, and League of Legends.)  I am still in contact with the users and can have them verify without any problems that I am trustworthy(My previous reddit name was Lajik).  I've even done several trades on my new account on this forum already, you can check my previous history.

The account has several ""Costume Options"" as well as the limited edition ""Hauberk of the Mithril Guard"".  In addition to the 8026 Turbine Points.  I also paid for both expansions from the Turbine Store of ""Mines of Moria"" and ""Mirkwood"" so both of these are unlocked.  As well as the classes that come with them, so all classes are unlocked.  The characters have a lot of rested XP it looks like too, lol.

I'm not looking for 80 dollars, obviously.  I'm not even looking for a lot of money worth.  Just someone who would like to play and put it to use. I invested about 120 into this account from Turbine Store + Expansions but I'm aiming at a much lower ballpark for some junk off Steam.  Let me know about offers, games from my Wishlist are as follows:

* Anno 2070 Deluxe Edition + DLC (Instant Trade)

I just wanted you guys to know that we diligently comb through the spam filter to make sure that valid submissions aren't getting caught.  Despite our best efforts, a good number of valid posts still get snagged.  I've noticed some patterns in stuff that gets hyper-actively pulled and figured I could pass on a few tips for 'making it through' the spam filter. 


**Ideal Format (or something VERY close):**

[USA] [H] This game, That Game [PS3/360] [NES] [WII] || [W]  Games, Games, offers [PS3/360] [SNES] [3D0] [ATARI JAGAUR]

1. When you list the country, CAPS LOCK it.  It's cruise control for cool and surely you think your country is worth it.  

2. When you list multiple systems, CAPS LOCK it again and try to separate them.  The Spam filter doesn't seem to care about PS3/360 being posted together but other systems should be separated. 

3. Try to put spaces in as appropriate.  If the Spam filter gets confused because you put: [H]360Games[W]Ps3Offers... the spam filter is going to grab it.  

4. The Spam Filter seems to prefer it when you use these: [ ] or ( ) parenthesis.  

5. DO NOT POST AND DELETE.  If you make a post and delete it, only to repost it again immediately... the spam filter is going to be grabbing your posts thinking it's Spam.  If you spell something wrong, its ok.  Posting here is graded on a curve.  As long as everyone is going to understand what you want, LEAVE IT.   You can always edit the body of your post to clarify.  Again, DO NOT POST AND DELETE.  



If you guys have any questions, let me know.  And if you ever have a submission caught in the spam filter **please include a link to the submission when you message the mods**!!

As always... Remember to limit yourself to one post per week and always try to respect everyone else's threads.  Don't thread-crap just because you don't think something is a good deal... someone else still might want to make the swap.  If it's actually a bad swap, no-one will make the trade and that will be the end of it. 

Best of luck to everyone and happy swapping!  ",,False,,t5_2rbm7,True,,superstar,True,t3_oi1tb,http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/oi1tb/mod_message_re_spam_filter_submissions_getting/,
