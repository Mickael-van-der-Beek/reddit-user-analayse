Stopped by my LGS and saw they had Pmags in stock…So I bought all 20!

I was really surprised to see my LGS had ARs in stock, so I bought both of them…
 
Stopped by my local Wal-Mart and found they had 440 round lots of .223 ammo in stock, so I bought three, went outside and put on my fake glasses and moustache, went back in and bought another three!

Hooray for all of you and thanks for being part of the problem. I haven’t shot my AR since before the madness hit and since I’m not a prepper, I don’t have 1000s of rounds stockpiled (my bad). I can’t even find .22LR in my area. 22LR! That folks, is batsh*t insane. Maybe if we stopped all the panic purchasing (I know this idea is equally insane), stock levels could stabilize, prices would begin to recede, and all of us could get back to shooting and enjoying our rifles. Imagine if all the online companies had time to catch up on order processing and shipping. Those magazines, BCGs, or uppers you ordered in December might actually get to you before July. Ok, so you’re not on board with a complete moratorium on purchasing. How about this; the next time you are at your LGS, Cabela’s, Wal-Mart, etc., and they have ammo, ARs, magazines or spare parts in stock, buy what you need and leave some for the next guy/gal. Maybe they will do the same, and we can all benefit. BTW, I’m sure the banks that issue our credit cards just love the interest they are making on all these panic purchases. C’mon now, you know that most of us are not using cash to buy all this stuff…

1364025353.0,109,self.ar15,1aum95,Warning about Knesek Guns Inc. ,KosherHam,124,15,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/1aum95/warning_about_knesek_guns_inc/,"My advice is, never buy anything Knesek Guns Inc.

Almost a year ago I saw that Knesek was selling the Remington RGP upper. I emailed them and ask if it they had any in stock, and if I- a civilian can purchase one. They replied back saying yes, they have 10 and that I can buy one.

So I sent them a check for the full amount, which they cashed. And to this day, I still do not have the upper.

Late last year I wrote Remington asking about the RGP upper and rifle itself- since no one else is selling them. Not online like Knesek Guns, and no local gun stores in a handful of states. Remington said it is not on the open market. I even had a friend email and ask them as well- just be sure we got the same story. We did. Explains why no one else is selling them, and no one is posting the upper online as ""Looked what I brought home!""

I forwarded the emails Knesek, and they took down their ad of the Remington RGP upper. I asked for my money back, since the product can not be purchased. They said sure, but they will keep 45% of my funds since I'm cancelling. However- I'm not cancelling. It's just not for sale. 

They wouldn't even entertain the idea of buying something else in stock. $1538 can buy a nice pistol and shotgun- other items they sell. 

The owner, Larry Knesek emailed me, saying he will return my funds, minus the 45% since they have put some effort in this issue.  

It's just unacceptable. 

BBB has been trying to work with them- however the only response Knesek gave was that they have the RGP uppers coming in. Of course they provide no evidence with this, and go silent when Remington says it's not for sale on the open market. 


So Knesek Gun Inc has basically stolen my money.


This isn't as if I am bored of the wait and have am complaining. Spikes Tactical- I ordered a lower from them around the time I bought the upper. ST said it would be about 6 months, turned out to be 8 months. No problem. I understand they make a great a product, and they have back orders and whatnot. I get it the delay. They are honest and friendly. 

What Knesek Gun has done is fraud and theft. I strongly advise- Do not ever buy from them, and ensure the people you like to not buy from them. 

I'm adding the last emails from myself to Larry Knesek, and his reply at the bottom for those interested, to see what kind of asshole Larry Knesek is. 

So, lessons learned.

Do not send checks. Had I used my card, I would have just filled out one form from my bank, and I would have money back. 

Do not be so eager to buy a sexy product (The RGP is sexy in my opinion) that when you see only one company selling it, that you jump without fully looking (researching). 

Knesek Guns is terrible place to purchase anything from.



(From me)
I feel you are being obtuse on purpose, because I have been clear with you two times already. I want the item, I have paid for it. However it is not on the market. Remington has confirmed the item you are attempting to sell is not possible, therefore your company cannot fulfill this order. This is the reason no local gun stores are attempting to sell the Remington upper, and cannot be found anywhere online. Its the reason Remington are not selling it themselves. Again, the company itself has confirmed it the Remington RPG upper that I paid for is not on the market.

I'll be contacting better business bureau in Arkansas, while cc'ing the ATF and district attorney of Arkansas. 




(Larry Knesek)
I take it by the language of the email meaning you do not want to proceed with the order. Me and my staff have and will be here for any questions. We have contacted the manufacturer again and they have guaranteed that we will be getting them. I must warn you, we take threats seriously and I have now turned this over to my attorneys. We will be responding to the BBB and also the district attorney of AR and anyone else that you fraudulently file claims with. Especially the ATF. I will legally sue you for everything I possibly can and will within 24 hours of being notified once any of the aforementioned have been completed. Also, this upper is for class 3 weapons. I take it you have a class 3 in your possession, and that you are not illegally purchasing this? If you want to go this route. I will be issuing you a refund check per our terms and conditions. Any further communications will be considered harassment and handled appropriately.

My old house was in the meth/dogfighting capital of indiana.  I am a in the process of moving and old man next door tells me about a rot who has been roaming the neighborhood trying to bite people, took some ladys little dog and ate it!  I was glad to be moving.  I sat my ar in its case on the counter--first to go.  I hear a door slam--wife is frantic about being chased by dog.  I load up the AR just in case.  I look out the window and the lady on the other side of me is playing with her baby in the yard.  The rot is in the other neighbors yard looking over.  At this point I have a round chambered and safety off.  I move outside and lean against the garage weapon down.  The rot is focused, the child began crying, bam he takes off.  I raise my rifle, I am on a plane 4ft higher than the dog, there is a cornfield behind my house.  I lead him, squeeze off two shots in succession, first shot pauses him, second is a chest shot.  He gets back up, two more put him down.  I walk down to check him, the woman is holding her child, she knew what had almost happened.  I put one more round in his head to finish him.  As I looked closer I could see a missing eye, a chewed off tail, genitals mangled, scars beyond scars on the face and legs.  This dog was obviously a fight dog that had gotten loose.  No cops ever showed, nobody even seemed to care.  I loaded the dog in the back of my jeep and took him to my parents so he could at least have a proper burial and peaceful rest.  I was glad he was out of his misery--Wish it could have been the guy who made him into a monster instead.

1346340624.0,75,self.ar15,z2xbp,Upper receiver terminology explained,Shady14,89,14,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/z2xbp/upper_receiver_terminology_explained/,"Welcome to the wonderful world of the AR-15. Chances are if you are reading this in the subreddit, you are already showing symptoms of the dreaded Black Rifle Disease, which can result in being broke or considered crazy by peers(most likely both).

Here's some very basic terminology and info for those of you that are trying to get started. I'll make a similar post, if wanted, about lower receivers.

Unless you have a large complement of gunsmithing tools and the technical knowledge to build an upper, you will most likely be buying a pre-assembled one. Here's a rundown of common terms and phrases. **THERE ARE MANY VARIATIONS. THIS WILL COVER THE MOST COMMON AND AVAILABLE TYPES.**



*Upper Receiver*

* **M4 feed ramps** - allows for better feeding from magazines. Highly recommended
* **MPI/HPT** - QC measures, means that your upper is within tolerances.
* **A2 Upper** - this upper will have a carry handle that is built into the upper. 
* **A4 upper** - this is a flat top upper receiver. allows flexibility.

*Length (of gas system):*

* **Rifle Length** - Gasblock pinned around 13 or so inches. takes 12 inch handguards and rails. 
* **Midlength** - gasblock pinned around 10 inches. Takes 9 inch handguards. Allows best cycling of bolt.
* **Carbine(m4)** - gasblock pinned around 8 inches. takes 7 inch handguards. a bit harsher recoil. Military standard.

*Length(of most widely available barrels)*

* **20 inch**  - standard for m16. Highest velocity. Almost always a rifle length gas system
* **16 inch** - most widely distributed. Great compromise between velocity and length.  
* **14.5 inch** - standard for military m4's. These are only available to civilians(without a tax stamp) if the flash hider is pinned to the barrel, bringing the overall length to 16 inches or over. Available with both carbine and mid length gas systems
* **11.5, 10.5, 7.5** - civilians can only acquire these barrels if they are mounting them on an SBR(with a tax stamp) or an ar-15 pistol. Carbine length gas systems.

*Barrel terminology*

* **CHF** - cold hammer forged. should be more durable
*  **Button rifled/CMV/regular** - button rifled. perfectly fine for all intents and purposes. Military standard.
*  **Chrome lined** - the interior of the barrel is coated with hard chrome. This allows quicker cleaning and longer barrel life. However, it has been observed to slightly decrease accuracy. Military standard
* **Twist** - this denotes the amount of inches the rifling takes to rotate once, fully. For instance, a 1:7 twist means the rifling twists once every 7 inches. For AR-15's anything between 1:7 and 1:9 is acceptable. Lighter ammo(55 grn and lower) works better with slower twists(1:9). Heavier ammo(55gr+) works better with faster twists. The overwhelming majority of ammo is 55 grain and 62 grain, and either twist will fire these fine. However, for super-accurate heavy match ammo, (69gr, 77gr) A 1:7 twist is needed.

*Barrel Profile*

* **Heavy** - heavy barrel. slowest to heat up, slowest to cool down. lowest propensity for barrel flex(the wobbling of the barrel as the bullet exits)
* **a2 profile/unlisted** - medium barrel. medium attributes. Military Standard.
* **lightweight** - lighter. good compromise between pencil and a2
* **pencil** - super thin barrel. Heats up quickly, disperses heat quickly. highest propensity for barrel flex.*

*Bolt carrier group/assembly*

* **MPI/HPT** - this means the bolt has been magnetic particle inspected and high pressure tested. This does not make your bolt carrier better, but it is a form of Quality control to insure that your bolt carrier is within spec and good to go
* **Semi-auto/Commercial/civilian Bolt Carrier** - this is a commercialized version of a bolt carrier group made specifically for civilian markets. It has material removed from the bottom rear.
* **Full Auto/m16/milspec bolt carrier group**  - this is the military's version of a BCG. It is heavier, which allows better bolt cycling. I cannot stress this enough: **THESE ARE 100% LEGAL FOR ANY CIVILIAN TO OWN**. They have no bearing whatsoever on the semi-auto status of the rifle.
*  **Chrome** these BCG's are made out of hard chrome. They are not neccessary, but many like the look. they are easier to clean.
* **Chromed/Nib-X** these are regular BCG's that are plated with chrome, or with Nickel-Boron. They are stronger and easier to clean, but they have issues: many times the plating will be thick enough to cause tolerance issues within the upper receiver. Do research before purchasing one of these.

*Charging handle*

* These are somewhat self explanatory, and preference based. I'd recommend getting a good one with a large latch. the smaller latched ones are harder to actuate and very easy to lose grip on  

*Muzzle Devices:*

* **Flash Hiders** - minimize flash or signature at the tip of the weapon. The standard is the A2, the industry favorite is the YHM Phanton or Smith Vortex
* **Muzzle Brakes and Compensators** - Muzzle brakes reduce felt recoil, and compensators reduce muzzle climb. This is usually at the expense of a large flash signature or a very intrusive concussion effect from your muzzle.

*Chambering:* 

* **.223 Remington** - 223 remington is the civilianized version of the 5.56x45 nato. It is a lower pressure round and slightly differentiated in case design. 
* **5.56x45 nato** - the military version of .223. Higher pressure.
* **YOU CAN SHOOT .223 OUT OF A 5.56 RIFLE. IT IS NOT ADVISED THAT YOU DO THE INVERSE**

*Sights*

* **Iron Sights** - I extremely strongly suggest that anyone who buys an ar-15 practice the hell out of using their iron sights. Not only is it fun, but it is how the rifle was supposed to be shot and your best bet if your electronic system fails. Iron sights have no batteries or circuits to shit out on you when you need them.
* **Red Dots** - Big names are Aimpoint, EOTech, Trijicon, Mepro. These are all extremely expensive options, but worth the money if you are into it. Pick which one you like and empty the wallet. **ALTERNATIVELY** if you want a cheap option, pick up a Vortex or Primary Arms clone. They aren't for combat, but they hold up very well and don't lose zero.
* **Scopes** - You should know what a scope is. Please keep in mind that the max effective range for an ar-15 is about 600 meters(for most of us), so don't go out and buy a 30x-100000x scope. 
* **Back up/flip up iron sights** - this is a good option for those running red dots. This allows you to run a RDS, and if that fails to simply flip up the back ups and keep shooting. Go with Troy or Magpul here.

My recommendation for a first timer, all purpose high quality rifle would be as follows:

* Upper: Flat top(A4), M4 feed ramps and HPT/MPI
* Chamber - 5.56x45 Nato
* Muzzle Device - A2 Flash hider
* Sights - Iron Sights 
* Barrel: 16 inch
* Gas system: midlength
* Twist: 1:7
* Chrome Lined: Yes
* Profile: A2/Standard
* Button rifled or CHF: Either - both are fine. CHF is more expensive but more durable. 
* Bolt Carrier Group: Full auto/m16/mil spec
* Charging handle: Large paddle. Name Brand


I'm sure I've missed or made mistakes on a few things, so please add feedback.

I hope this helps the noobs out there - please feel free to PM me any questions or leave them here.

I own a Bushmaster AR-15 platform weapon.  I love taking it to the range to plink off a few rounds now and then.  However, I have never ""assaulted"" somebody with my AR.  So I fail to see how President Obama identifies my rifle as an ""assault rifle"".  The only thing that differentiates our ""assault rifles"" from hunting rifles is black paint, pistol grips, and collapsible stocks.  Other than that, a .223 hunting rifle is just as dangerous as the ""dreaded"" ""assault rifles"" we responsibly own.  They are about to ban our guns (again) because they ""look scary"".  Diane Feinstein IGNORANTLY calls them ""military style""....if they were ""military style"", they'd come standard with burst or full automatic fire and a Trijicon scope mounted as standard equipment.  We are about to relive 1994; ignorant politicians exploiting public emotions to suppress our rights...all.  over.  again.  Sorry for the rant.  Watching the news is frustrating me, and I should probably stop now.

But seriously, the time to get active is now.  Call your local House representatives and Senators.  Make it absolutely clear to them that if they help to pass anti-gun legislation, that you will do your damnedest to ensure they are never elected to public office again.  Republicans own the House.  We need to remind them that there is no room to negotiate on the Bill of Rights.

Avoid these guys at all costs.

I ordered a Spike's Tactical Nickel Boron BCG on December 21st from Valhalla Tactical Supply (vtsupply.com) for the price of $219.95 before shipping.

I received an email from them 2 weeks later on Jan 7th stating that they could not honor my purchase and they would cancel my order and refund my card.

Browsing their site this past Friday the 18th, I see the same part # available again, for $530!!! (http://vtsupply.com/spike-39-s-tactical-nickel-boron-m16-bcg-fail-zero-bolt-carrier.html)

As of this post, they have since removed the part from their site and have not responded to my multiple attempts to contact them regarding this issue.

Secondly, we spent a good part of this month exploring the options for re-locating ARFCOM. We've spent two years and an immeasurable amount of blood sweat and tears working on a retail location that at this point will never open thanks to NY politics.

For those of you following the case, the suit against New York State has been filed, and AR15.com has been dropped as a plaintiff. Since our goal is to do what's best for the case, we will do whatever the legal team thinks is best and we will continue to support the case in any way possible.

While we will continue to do all we can to attempt to ""fix"" NY, we will do so from outside of the state where most of us have spent the last 35+ years. We have decided to pack everything and everyone up, hitch the wagons, and head to the Lone Star State; the Dallas, TX area will be our new home in the near future.

While this will not be a simple move, nor is it going to be without it's challenges, we feel that it is a necessary move. We cannot morally continue to support a state that has such disregard for the basic principles this country was founded on, nor do we want to live in an environment where you're constantly fighting the very government that is supposed to be representing you.

Lastly, we've been debating what to do with the shop opening, or what is now more-likely a going away party. All of the ARFCOM HQ properties are going on the market, and we will continue to do business out of the facility until the actual move. We've had regular traffic coming in and purchasing parts and accessories, and we'll continue to do all we can for our fellow New Yorkers.

In the next few days a number of our private firearms will be going up for sale as part of a combination moving-fundraiser / less-to-carry event.

WHAT YOU DON’T KNOW COULD HURT YOU

By: Human Events 2/15/2011 03:01 AM

Is firing a 5.56 NATO cartridge in your .223 Remington chambered AR15 dangerous? Or do Internet forum-ninjas and ammunition companies selling you commercial ammo instead of surplus overstate the dangers? Believe it or not, a real danger exists, and some gun owners who think they are doing the right thing may not be safe.

The Cartridges

The .223 Remington and 5.56×45 NATO cartridges are very similar, and externally appear the same. But there are some differences that lie beneath the surface.

The 5.56 case has thicker walls to handle higher pressures, meaning the interior volume of the case is smaller than that of a .223. This will alter the loading data used when reloading 5.56 brass to .223 specs.

Some 5.56 loads have a slightly longer overall length than commercial .223 loads.

The Chambers

The significant difference between the .223 Rem and 5.56 NATO lies in the rifles, rather than the cartridges themselves. Both the .223 and 5.56 rounds will chamber in rifles designed for either cartridge, but the critical component, leade, will be different in each rifle.

The leade is the area of the barrel in front of the chamber prior to where the rifling begins. This is where the loaded bullet is located when a cartridge is chambered. The leade is frequently called the “throat.”

On a .223 Remington spec rifle, the leade will be 0.085”. This is the standard described by the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers’ Institute, Inc. (SAAMI). The leade in a 5.56 NATO spec rifle is 0.162”, or almost double the leade of the .223 rifle.

A shorter leade in a SAAMI spec rifle creates a situation where the bullet in a 5.56 NATO round, when chambered, can contact the rifling prior to being fired. By having contact with the rifling prematurely (at the moment of firing), chamber pressure can be dramatically increased, creating the danger of a ruptured case or other cartridge/gun failure.

The reverse situation, a .223 Rem round in a 5.56 NATO gun, isn’t dangerous. The leade is longer, so a slight loss in velocity and accuracy may be experienced, but there is not a danger of increased pressures and subsequent catastrophic failure.

How serious is the danger of firing 5.56 ammo in .223 guns? Dangerous enough that the SAAMI lists 5.56 military ammo as being not for use in .223 firearms in the technical data sheet titled “Unsafe Firearm-Ammunition Combinations.”

ATK, the parent company of ammunition manufacturers Federal Cartridge Company and Speer, published a bulletin entitled “The Difference Between 223 Rem and 5.56 Military Cartridges.” In this bulletin, ATK stated using 5.56 ammo in a .223 rifle could result in “…primer pocket gas leaks, blown cartridge case heads, and gun functioning issues.”

However, the danger may be lower than SAAMI or ATK suggest. In Technical Note #74 from ArmaLite, the company states “millions of rounds of NATO ammunition have been fired safely in Eagle Arms and ArmaLite’s® SAAMI chambers over the past 22 years,” and they have not had any catastrophic failures.

According to ArmaLite:

“Occasionally a non-standard round (of generally imported) ammunition will fit too tightly in the leade, and resistance to early bullet movement can cause elevated chamber pressures. These pressures are revealed by overly flattened primers or by powder stains around the primer that reveal leaking gasses.”

What Do You Have?

So, if you own a rifle chambered for the .223 for 5.56, do you know for which caliber it is really chambered?

Many match rifles are chambered in .223 Remington (SAAMI specs) for tighter tolerances, and theoretically better accuracy.

Many of the AR-15’s currently sold on the market are made for the 5.56 NATO cartridge. If you own one of these, you should be fine with any .223 or 5.56 ammunition.

However, ATK dropped this bomb in the bulletin on the .223/5.56:

“It is our understanding that commercially available AR15’s and M16’s – although some are stamped 5.56 Rem on the receiver – are manufactured with .223 chambers.”

So, even if your AR is stamped 5.56, is it really? Check your owner’s manual or call the company directly and make sure you get an answer you feel comfortable with.

As if the confusion regarding the .223 vs 5.56 chambers wasn’t enough, there is a third possibility in the mix, that is being used by at least one major manufacturer. The .223 Wylde chamber is a modified SAAMI-spec .223 chamber that allows for the safe use of 5.56 NATO rounds, but maintains tighter tolerances for better accuracy.

Yeah, yeah… What’s the bottom line?

Here’s the bottom line. If you want to follow the safest possible course, always shoot .223 Remington ammunition. The .223 Rem cartridge will safely shoot in any rifle chambered for the .223 or 5.56. If you want to shoot 5.56 NATO rounds, make sure you have a rifle designed for the 5.56 military cartridge. Shooting 5.56 in a normal .223 Rem rifle can result in bad things.",,False,self,t5_2reap,False,,,True,t3_17f2t8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/17f2t8/223_vs_556_ammunition_what_you_dont_know_could/,

In short, Magpul would be unable to remain in business as a CO company, and the over 200 jobs for direct employees and nearly 700 jobs at our subcontractors and suppliers would pick up and leave CO. Due to the structure of our operations, this would be entirely possible, hopefully without significant disruption to production.""

I inquired with their customer service department and the response I got was basically ""Sometimes our site charges your card for items in your cart, and doesn't create an order. We are sorry and we will refund the charges."" The charges were credited within a few days and all is well. 

I happened to be checking my Amazon credit card this evening and **there are another two charges for $170.94 each on this card too**. I have never used this card to purchase anything from their site (it may be saved under my account, but I've never ordered anything). I am sure they will refund the charges, but I think everyone should double check their statements because had I not seen this, I would be out $700.

Thank you for contacting me about our Second Amendment rights.  It is good to hear from you.  

I am a gun owner who believes in the right to bear arms in defense of self, family and property.  During my 12 years serving in Congress, I received an ""A"" rating from the National Rifle Association for defending our Constitutional Rights.  I opposed the so-called ""assault weapons ban"" and opposed the Brady Bill.  I supported repealing both the Clinton gun ban and the Washington, D.C. gun ban.  I voted to protect the private information of gun owners; to protect state gun laws; and to protect firearm and ammunition manufacturers, dealers or importers from lawsuits and damages related to criminal misuse by a third party.  

As a life-long hunter, I also believe the rights and freedoms of hunters must be guarded and I developed an executive order that the president signed to enhance hunting and fishing opportunities at wildlife refuges and national preserves.  As your Senator, I will continue to protect our Constitutional freedoms and will be a strong advocate for preserving these rights and traditions for future generations.  

Thank you for taking the time to contact my office.  For more information, I encourage you to visit my website at www.portman.senate.gov.  Please keep in touch.  


Sincerely,


Rob Portman

If this is something you may be interested in, stop on by and check it out.  We have a healthy mix of newbies as well as seasoned vets such as /user/foghorn5950, who are helping moderate and answers questions.

&gt;We are proud to announce that within a matter of days we will be going live with a new program. Due to a bill currently moving through the Colorado legislature, there is the possibility that Colorado residents' ability to purchase standard capacity magazines will soon be infringed. Before that happens, and Magpul is forced to leave the state in order to keep to our principles, we will be doing our best to get standard capacity PMAGs into the hands of any Colorado resident that wants them.

&gt;Verified Colorado residents will be able to purchase up to ten (10) standard capacity AR/M4 magazines directly from Magpul, and will be given immediate flat-rate $5 shipping, bypassing our current order queue.

&gt;Our customers outside of Colorado, please know that our PMAG production will continue at an ever-increasing rate until we do relocate, shipments to our distributors in other states will continue, and that we do not expect relocation to significantly impact PMAG production. We are also aware that Colorado is not the only state with existing or pending magazine capacity restrictions; we are working on programs for other affected states as well.

&gt;Full details and instructions will be announced when we are able to go live; please watch here for the coming announcement.",,False,self,t5_2reap,False,,,True,t3_19cvcp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/19cvcp/magpul_announces_program_to_sell_standard/,

Through a lot of reading, and a good amount of asking /r/ar15 and /r/guns a lot of silly questions I managed to buy and assemble my first AR, and join the ranks.

Parts:
PSA 16"" Barrel

PSA LPK

Magpul MOE grip and trigger guard

Magpul STR stock

Midwest Industries 15"" Freefloat quad rail

Primary Arms 4-16x Illuminated scope + mount

YHM low profile gas block



Build thoughts:
I have nearly 0 firearms experience. I've shot handguns less then a handful of times, and never any rifles. I didn't run into too many snags, but what I did I could google my way through.


My biggest issue was getting my low profile gas block on the barrel. At first I thought I got the wrong size, until I measured. They were both exactly .750 on the dot. I ended up having to put the barrel in the freezer, gas block in the oven, a little grease on the barrel and a 30 second ballet of oven mitts, gas tubes and a soft mallet got it on nicely.


The only other issue I ran into was after full assembly, I tried to run a few snap caps through and see if it manually cycled right and it wouldn't. It wasn't ejecting right and would feed a 2nd in. I ran down to my local range and the guy looked at it and cycled the rounds right through as I looked on with a -_- face. Apparently I was too afraid of breaking something and not racking the charging handle very well.


Edit: One other thing I ran into was the screw into the grip not going all the way in. I was semi-prepared for that as I read in some reviews the yellow loctite that Magpul puts on the screw needs to come off. I ran into that but I knew just what to do. Funny part was I had helped someone out a week ago with that issue on the forum!



Vendor Thoughts:
I pieced everything together over about 2 months from a few different vendors. Some I had really good experiences through and some were terrible.

They had some trouble getting the fax from my new FFL and it took a few days to ship but overall they were good. My 2nd order for the charging handle went great.


Arctic Shooting Supply - Bought my upper from them. I went through EVERY distributor on Mega Arms site, and these guys were the only one, and they had 50 in stock some how. Their website is bad, but under construction. The first time I went there, it said to place and order and call in, but there were no phone numbers lol. The next day it had them up. You place an order online then call in your payment. No online method of checking orders or getting tracking -_- but they were helpful via phone. Good experience if you can tolerate the interesting ordering method.


Palmetto State Armory - These guys have great prices, if your lucky enough to catch something in stock, it seems like a roller coaster. I got my barrel and LPK on separate orders. I'm not sure if business is booming, or they need more staff but my first order took 5 business days to ship, and my 2nd took 7 days. These guys were the only ones that didn't ship the day after I placed an order. Loved everything I got from them though.


Brownell's and Midway USA - Both of these guys were exactly the same, and honestly exactly what I would expect from your standard ""mega vendor"". Good prices, shipped same/next day. Wouldn't hesitate to buy from either again. Bought some random parts and tools from both.


Primary Arms - Got my scope and mount from here. After some reviews from the guys on AR15.com I decided on the 4-16x Illuminated from PA. I went to place my order and found out they didn't take Amex, I was bummed. All the posts I had read about PA said that the owner, Marshall was tip top customer service so... I emailed him at almost midnight asking if he had any other methods he could take payment through. Got an answer within 5 minutes, with a solution. Placed the order as a money order type, sent paypal, emailed him back and I got confirmation in a few minutes and he told me it would ship the next day and it did. Scope feels and looks great. Wonderful tactile clicks, great finish, clear glass. Because of Marshall's above and beyond, I wouldn't hesitate to look to these guys for anything I need to purchase in the future. Great small business, and I love to support these kinds of guys.


Mega Arms - These guys were straight up awesome. They couldn't tell me who might have some in stock but they were super nice, and helpful in my search to get what I wanted. REALLY happy with the fit and finish of the Mega Arms upper/lower.


EDIT: Some other things I wanted to put in here but forgot about, that might assist some other new builders.
Here are a few links that were invaluable to me.


ITS has a full video series on a step by step build. I watched it a few times before I even had any parts in hand.
http://www.itstactical.com/warcom/firearms/diy-ar-15-build-introduction-parts-and-tools-required/

CMMG has a great video on building a lower. I didn't have any hitches using this and I think it only took me about 2x as long as the video.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6AZ1jxJGRM

Ultimate Reloader has a great video specifically for installing the Midwest Industries handguards that I had. This helped make it tremendously easy. If you're going MI, bookmark this.

I've been doing a lot of research into AR-15s, and am planning on buying my first AR-15 pre-assembled. If you guys don't mind, I had two quick questions that I'd like to ask:

1. Are AR-15 prices back to normal yet? I've been reading that prices were inflated significantly post-Sandy Hook, but haven't read anything about prices coming down.

2. Would it be cheaper to purchase a pre-assembled AR-15 directly from a manufacturer (such as LMT or DD), or to buy it from my LGS? I live in the same city as the only Cheaper Than Dirt retail location in the country, so I was thinking about giving that a shot (after I return from my internship, currently in another state entirely).

1376322890.0,36,self.ar15,1k7o0u,UPDATE: Finally got the Primary Arms Micro Dot out to the range...my thoughts on it...,pyrplhaze,45,9,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/1k7o0u/update_finally_got_the_primary_arms_micro_dot_out/,"See [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/1hn9l5/primary_arms_micro_dot_it_has_arrived_pics_and/) for the pics and initial opinions…

Got to take it out on Friday…Here are my thoughts!

-	Was a bright and hot day.  Flip the bugger on, dial up the brightness to about 7 (scale goes to 11) and I had a clear sight picture, with no fuzziness on the dot.  +1
-	Time to start the zeroing process…. All this was done at the 50yd range.  I’d gotten it somewhat close at home by “zeroing” it as best as I could with my irons, praying I’d be on paper for the first shot, load the mag, drop the bolt, send 3 downrange, making sure dot is centered on target.  All this was done at the 50yd range
-	Check the spotting scope, success!  On paper, all 3 shots.  A good bit up and to the left, though….make some dramatic adjustments since I don’t feel like counting the clicks.  
-	Next 3…oops!  Way overcompensated, now we are still on paper, but at a 4 oclock position, as opposed to 11…ok, I’m going to start counting my clicks [peers through spotting scope, approximates the needed adjustment, make adjustment]
-	Send 3 more…getting better here.  Moved about the expected amount.  Not quite dead center, still about the 4 oclock position, but closer to 10 ring. 
-	Then it dawns on me…I’m steady handed, using a bag on the front, shoulder support on the back, consistent sight picture, why the hell are my groups not tighter?  Drop the mag, clear the chamber, and take a look.  Mount has come loose, and is a bit wobbly on the rail.  OK, simple enough, guess I just didn’t lock it down good.  [locks it down good]
-	A few more rounds, getting closer, groups a bit tighter, then they open back up.  Shit.  Loose mount again.  Motherfucker.
-	OK, getting real close here, fine tuning the adjustments.  Shitty part is that I’m now having to shoot while holding the mount on tight. &lt;--This is frustrating as hell.
-	Few more rounds, bit more fine tuning, ok, fuck it. Got it close enough for today, it’s like 100* out, wife is ready to go, and I’m not going to get a solid zero with a loose mount, and don’t feel like dealing with it.
-	I’ll be going back out on this coming Friday to finish up at 50 yards with the mount nice and tight, then step out to 100 to see how I like it….

So I got home, grabbed my sockets, and tightened the nut on the right side of the mount.  Now that sucker isn’t going anywhere.  Only problem with doing this is that now I have to loosen that nut if I desire to remove the optic from the gun.  Not that big of a deal to me, as I don’t plan on removing it, but it quickly renders a “Quick Detach” mount non-functioning, and is now a “permanent”  mount because the lever used to detach won’t budge with the nut being tightened.  

******EDIT**** /u/primaryarms has replied and informed that this isn't a QD mount, so disregard all that stuff.  This is a solid product, so go buy it!

All in all, I spent a tad over $100.  I got a dot that functions like I expected it to (easy to see in BRIGHT daylight, with plenty of brightness adjustment left over) and it adjusted appropriately (when I said move right and down, it did.  Didn’t really determine that 1 click = ¼” at 100 yards, but it’s close enough…should know for sure(ish) next time I go out).  The mount left something to be desired, but I’m not upset about it.  For the money spent, I feel like I got a solid deal.  Had the mount completely shit the bucket on me, I may be singing a different tune, but at the end of the day, I'm not going to be upset because a $10-15 mount doesn't work amazingly.  In my opinion, the PA sight is totally a rockin value for the cost; just beware that the QD mount may not be that ""QD-ish"".  

TL;DR: Sight is great value, mount is “eh”.  If I had to do it all over again, I’d definitely buy the sight, and would either grab a different QD mount, or just get a permanent mount.

I will close this thread if this is not the appropriate place.  

I'm in a situation where I want to build a AR-15. My wife is OK with me having a CCW and a .22 Rifle. Recently while visiting some friends she heard that a guy we vaguely know recently bought a AR for ""home defense"".  Unfortunately for me, this guy isn't know to be very responsible with money or his life choices. Her group of friends started bad mouthing him and ""why would he need something like that!"" She somewhat agreed even though she knows I have a couple guns. From that conversation she already had a bad taste in her mouth in regards to ARs.

Have any of you been in situations where your significant other was against you building at AR-15? How did you convince them? Did you use resources or references? 

I plan on taking my wife out shooting with me so that she can understand the firearm and safe handling of guns.  I also would like her to take a class with me so that we can both better educated.

They fear guns, instead of having a healthy respect for them, and as a result they insist that all guns are inherently bad because they don't understand them, or they insist that certain ones are more dangerous because they don't understand them.

Demanding that politicians take some sort of firearm education course could help mitigate unnecessary legislation and help we law-abiding citizens preserve our 2nd amendment rights without constant interference from ignorant fearmongering.  There have been multiple instances where politicians have come out and brazenly spoken with authority on firearms and their dangers without really knowing much about them.

For instance, politicians and the media love throwing out the phrase ""semi-automatic"" and ""assault rifle"" in the same sentence and it's usually not to say, ""semi-automatic weapons are not assault rifles"".  High caliber hunting rifles are semi-automatic.  Most handguns are semi-automatic.  They think that putting black plastic and a pistol grip on a rifle make it an ""assault weapon"".  They are largely ignorant of how guns function and in what capacity, yet instead of taking the time as our representatives to educate themselves on what is one of the hottest topics in the country and becoming knowledgeable, they choose to live in ignorant bliss, using reactionary and uninformed methods of pandering to their constituents and supporters.

Politicians have set forth a multitude of mandatory citizen education courses and certifications that help ensure that we are conducting ourselves in a manner that is in keeping with responsible and lawful practices.  It only stands to reason that as people who are hired by us, paid by us, work for us, represent us and make decisions that ultimately affect us, that we should have the right to demand they educate themselves in their job field, just as they demand truck drivers, liquor servers, CHL carriers, and a list of other professions be trained and certified.  

Firearm education for politicians seems like it would at the very least be a good start toward responsible, reasonable, sound-minded legislation.  What do you guys think?

I've been wanting an 5.56 carbine for a while and decided that a completed one would be best for me. As much as I'd love to build own piece by piece, my work and family schedule has really cut down on my alone time. Buying a completed rifle means I'll spend more time at the range when the opportunity presents itself.

I was in the market for either a high-end AR or a SCAR 16S. I shot the SCAR and loved it; truly a fantastic weapon. For ARs I looked at Daniel Defense, Noveske, BCM, LaRue and Colt but only fired Colts as that's what the range had. I decided to go to the local gun show this Saturday with the intent of walking out with a rifle. I did.

I handled the SCAR again but ultimately decided I'd have more fun playing with the AR modular platform. Looking at and handling the ARs side by side, it was clear that the Noveske was in a league of its own from a fit and finish perspective (I couldn't get ahold of a LaRue but as I understand they're comparable to Noveske). The BCM, Colt and Daniel Defense were roughly comparable when comparing finish, with the Daniel Defense edging out the other two from a fit standpoint (AR slop, etc.).

After some serious consideration, I decided to pay the Colt tax for a few reasons:

* The M4A1 Carbine rollmark is pretty badass
* This rifle is as close as you can get to a SOPMOD Block II out of the box
* The collector value of the Colt should be superior to the others and intend to have this for a long time

The other rifles were absolutely superb, but this one felt right to me. I was able to get it for $1650 which is about as low as I've seen it anywhere (I did a spot price check before making the offer and couldn't find it online for less than $1680, and that was an auction price). It's an expensive AR for sure, but it ticked the boxes in a way that only this model could.

For now, the only mod I intend to make to it is to add a SOPMOD stock (either B5 or LMT, both of which supply stocks to SOCOM) and maybe a foregrip. I don't care for the ambidextrous safety but a different grip may change how it hits/doesn't hit my hand. I'll put a few thousands rounds through the irons before considering optics of any kind.

UPDATE: I put 40 rounds through it at the local indoor range. No surprises. The stock is WAY too short for me as expected and I even hit my cheek with the charging handle a few times (I'm 6'4"" and really had to cock my head with the short draw). The trigger is damn good, far better than the SCAR 16S I shot a few weeks ago. Can't wait to take it out to a real range!",,False,self,t5_2reap,1355788927.0,,,True,t3_14zy0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/14zy0f/my_first_ar_colt_le6920_socomii/,

I have been buying ammo when I can find it at a decent price, I have some Winchester, PMC, and Federal/American Eagle. The Winchester and PMC both look very clean and shiny. 

However the Federal/American Eagle ammo doesn't look so nice.  The brass has dark splotches and the copper also has these deposits on it. Should this be a concern? What am I looking at [Here?](http://i.imgur.com/3hT62a5.jpg) With my potato camera and poor lighting couldn't get a good shot, but you can see what i'm talking about on the copper jacket. The brass looks better because of the flash.

Is this a result of poor ammo storage? This ammo came in a box and not a surplus/bag'd ammo.  (I do have 200rnds of bag'd federal ammo, but its not as bad as the box'd stuff, plus it has the green tip) I am saving all my brass to reload eventually, will I have any issues or will it clean right up?

Recently I decided to make my life MUCH easier and bought some decent starter tools for AR-15 assembly. I'm hoping this thread will help people that are starting to assemble their own ARs and I hope to learn from experienced builders here. 

I already owned a Weaver Gunsmith Tool Set that included: Drive punch set, Brass tapper, Brass/Nylon Hammer, Screwdriver with a ton of bits and a ""punch block."" I inherited this from a good friend and use it daily.

http://www.amazon.com/Weaver-Deluxe-Gunsmith-Tool-Kit/dp/B004NC188O/ref=sr_1_3?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368591121&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=weaver+screwdriver+set

Here's a list of tools that I've acquired to help me work on AR-15/AR-10 platform guns as well as others.:

 - Schuster Roll Pin Starter Punch Set: These two starters make putting the lower roll pins, gas tube and forward assist so easy. There are better ones out there, but these work just fine and fit the roll pins perfectly for $18.

http://www.midwayusa.com/product/694883/schuster-ar-15-roll-pin-starter-punch-set-2-piece-steel

 - Sears Craftsman 6pc. Roll Pin Punch Set: These are to finish pushing the roll pins in without slipping/mushrooming the pins.

http://www.sears.com/craftsman-6-pc-roll-pin-punch-set/p-00943167000P

 - 6pc Drive Punches from Harbor Freight: These are okay for starting off, but I use a Weaver gunsmithing set... I will upgrade these when I get more money. For now they sit in my punch roll for range repairs.

 - Model 1 Pivot pin installation tool: For $4 you simply cannot beat this tool... I wanted the Wheeler Engineering version, but they were sold out everywhere. This thing really saves your ass when you're putting lowers together.

http://www.midwayusa.com/product/920248/model-1-pivot-pin-detent-installation-tool-ar-15

 - Upper receiver block: This thing works pretty well, but I will upgrade to a hinged one with the insert where the BCG/CH filler piece.

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007LDRXWW/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

 - Lower receiver/mag block: Great for tightening down castle nuts, installing pivot pins and changing out stocks. 

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005J13VCO/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1

 - Tapco/Intrafuse AR-15 Armorer's Wrench: It's nice and has many features that are all labeled by stamping or engraving... the one marked ""BEER"" is a bottle opener, which is a nice touch. This tool has not let me down yet and although I'm not a fan of Tapco accessories, this thing is great.

http://www.amazon.com/Tapco-Intrafuse-AR-Armorers-Tool/dp/B006PTMYHM/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1368590041&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tapco+armorers+tool

 - US Peacekeeper Small Punch Roll: Very nice way to organize tools for the bench and on the go. It keeps all the AR-15 and pistol tools nice and tidy in my range bag. 

http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0044YGCA0/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1


The only other tools I keep in my bag are a Nylon/Brass hammer &amp; a Lyman screwdriver with common bits in the handle.

I hope you guys can use some of this info for future use... any suggestions are welcome.

Apparently Gov Hickenlooper has announced that he will sign HB 1224 on Wednesday. We were asked for our reaction, and here is what we said:

We have said all along that based on the legal problems and uncertainties in the bill, as well as general principle, we will have no choice but to leave if the Governor signs this into law. We will start our transition out of the state almost immediately, and we will prioritize moving magazine manufacturing operations first. We expect the first PMAGs to be made outside CO within 30 days of the signing, with the rest to follow in phases. We will likely become a multi-state operation as a result of this move, and not all locations have been selected. We have made some initial contacts and evaluated a list of new potential locations for additional manufacturing and the new company headquarters, and we will begin talks with various state representatives in earnest if the Governor indeed signs this legislation. Although we are agile for a company of our size, it is still a significant footprint, and we will perform this move in a manner that is best for the company and our employees. 

It is disappointing to us that money and a social agenda from outside the state have apparently penetrated the American West to control our legislature and Governor, but we feel confident that Colorado residents can still take the state back through recalls, ballot initiatives, and the 2014 election to undo these wrongs against responsible Citizens.

My AR is my dedicated home defense carbine, and right now it's loaded with 55gr XP193 because that's what I had left once the most recent panic set in, but as long as I'm spending $1+/round on 9x19mm JHPs for carrying, it'd be pretty hypocritical if I weren't willing to shell out for my first line of defense in the home. 

Reading over the ""best ammo for self defense"" article, I've gleaned that heavy boat-tail hollow point match ammo is probably the way to go, but the specifics are confusing me. The three rounds dubbed best for those rifles which can stabilize them (and mine can) are:

* Hornady 75gr OTM loads

* Nosler 77gr OTM loads

* Sierra 77gr SMK loads

OTM I've gathered to mean Open-Tip Match, and SMK Sierra Match King, but this list names three manufacturers in particular - Hornady, Nosler, and Sierra. The only exact match I've found for any of those rounds is the [Hornady 75gr BTHP](http://www.hornady.com/store/223-Rem-75-gr-BTHP-Match/) in .223, but the only place I've seen it available is running nearly $2/round. 

Conversely, I'm able to find ammo which is *close* to the rounds mentioned at far more reasonable prices, like this [Fiocchi 77gr SMK .223] (http://www.targetsportsusa.com/p-3669-fiocchi-exacta-223-remington-77-grain-sierra-matchking-hollow-point-ammunition.aspx), [Colt 77gr SMK 5.56](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/665749/colt-match-ammunition-556x45mm-nato-77-grain-sierra-matchking-hollow-point-boat-tail-box-of-20) (which I am eyeing in particular), and several retailers selling [Norma 77gr SMK .223](http://www.midwayusa.com/product/224324/norma-usa-match-ammunition-223-remington-77-grain-sierra-matchking-hollow-point-boat-tail-box-of-20) .  

Does the list, however, specifically mean Hornady, Sierra, and Nosler *loadings* of .223? As in, these manufacturers specifically load cartridges calibrated for home defense over match shooting, just using the same bullets? Is there a meaningful difference between an actual Nosler or Sierra-branded cartridges (if such things even exist? as best I can tell Sierra only makes bullets) and the items I've listed above? If not, I'd probably pick up 200 rounds of one of them to make sure they feed nicely and to keep at the ready.",,False,self,t5_2reap,False,,,True,t3_1gx7hi,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/1gx7hi/could_rar15_clear_up_the_best_choices_for_self/,

Advice needed.,epiquehead,36,7,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/1gc8sb/a_cops_ignorance_made_me_worried_about_my_ar15_80/,"I completed my own AR15 from an 80% lower receiver. I was talking to a cop friend of mine in San Diego and he was surprised it was legal. He was under the assumption that all guns were required to be registered in CA. Obviously, cops don't know everything and I don't really expect them to. So does anyone have any thoughts on paperwork I could carry with my rifle just in case an ""ignorant"" cop tries to make a stink about it. Right now I carry a flow chart that defines an ""assault weapon"" and information on ATF's website about the self manufacturing of a firearm. I just want to make sure I can defend myself.

1370468535.0,28,self.ar15,1fqzbu,"AR15 owners, could you do me a small favor? I need a few measurements to help me comply with the laws in my country.",zigni,31,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/ar15/comments/1fqzbu/ar15_owners_could_you_do_me_a_small_favor_i_need/,"I'm trying to plan a .300 blk AR15, but due to the stupid laws in my country I need to keep the OAL under 23.62 inches (60cm) for it to be legal. I've been looking around online for some measurements, but I haven't had much luck finding them. 

I live in Northern Ireland and unlike most of the rest of the UK, handguns are perfectly legal here, though semi auto centerfire rifles are not. However, as long as a firearm has a barrel of less than 30cm and an OAL of under 60cm, its considered a handgun in the eyes of the law. So, as long as I can keep an AR under those maximums, I can have one. I'd like to go .300 blk since it performs so well out of a short barrel. I'll also be pinning the stock in the closed position. I know of another guy who is doing something similar right now and someone else who just got a slightly modified semi auto MP5k (with a slightly shorter stock) this way.

Its sort of like how the guys in the mainland UK get around the handgun ban with long barrel revolvers that are just over the legal minimum length, but in reverse.

/u/whubbard has already been kind enough to give me some measurements, since his [8.2"" .300 blk SBR](http://imgur.com/a/t2XmW) is only about 3/4"" too long for my requirements. I'm hoping to save a little length with a shorter stock, that way I won't need to go much shorter with the barrel length. 

I'm looking for the following:

The length of your stock. Please include the exact model. 

The overall length of your rifle with the stock collapsed. Please include the length of your barrel. If you have a muzzle device on your rifle, please let me know which one and how much length it adds to you OAL.
