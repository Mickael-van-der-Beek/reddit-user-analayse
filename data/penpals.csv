In this fashion active writers would then be more recognizable and there would be an incentive to write responses and return letters. 

Every six months, I would be happy to send prizes to the most active penpals in this subreddit. (Probably pens, inks, nibs, or stationery.)

* Being young is **NOT** against the rules. Don't report people who are younger than what you'd expect, don't PM the moderators, and especially don't send me personal PM's. 
* Asking for a penpal for a relative or daughter/son is **NOT** against the rules. If someone defrauds you, PM the moderators, we'll ban them, and if it's egregious enough, we can forward the case to the administrators, but don't start reporting everyone who does it. They are not all con artists, they are nice folks who just want to help their children or relatives make a friend.
* Writing too little or too much is **NOT** against the rules. I'm exceedingly perplexed at why some people think this is. I applaud anyone and everyone who encourages others to write more, but reporting them is silly and I'm not going to argue with people via PM's about it. The punishment for writing too little is risking not finding a penpal – that's as far as that will go.

Now, I would like to remind people that if you lose touch with your penpal, trying to find them with *one* thread or *one* comment is more than fine. Feel encouraged. Spamming their thread over and over several days/weeks/months after the fact is **NOT** fine and you will be banned. Yes, I will go through the thread and ban each of your alternate accounts.

And the story would eventually be sent back to me once everyone on the list has written, the last person would write the end.

The way I would like this to work is I write my paragraph on a piece of paper, put it in an envelope with a list of the addresses of all of the people that are interested.

Edit: 

This is now open for international writers also, provided you write in English. 

There will be a minimum of two paragraphs and a maximum of two pages, that you can add to the story. 

My goal for this is to be a continuous story, created by hundreds of people instead of a bunch of different stories.

Each writer should write their name on the side of the page beside the start of your section. 

Everyone that is interested can send me their addresses on here with ""worldwide shared story"" at the top of your message or at jtwilson136@gmail.com with a subject of ""worldwide shared story"" and I will start making the list. Once I have enough people willing to get involved, with enough addresses I will notify everyone and send it to the first person.

Instead of doing one on one things, I will assign each penpal to a group of 4 or 5 students, and they will work together to draft letters, pose questions to you, and then prepare presentations to their class about you and your life/hobbies/culture etc.

I would prefer to do all of this via email rather than snail mail. 

My students are: age 19-22, English Majors (their English is not great, it is tough for students here), 90% are female, 10% male, they are very interested in Western culture, movies, TV, etc.

You should be 20 - 40 years old (Outside this range is not a huge problem but it is better if the students can relate to you), a native English speaker, friendly and forthcoming about your life and interests. Photos would also be appreciated, pics of family, your home, car, pets, workplace etc. NOT YOUR DICK. 

Please note, do not join if you are seeking ""Asian bitches"", if you want to get into hard core political discussions, or if you cannot maintain this commitment for less than 5 months (the duration of the semester). 

All mail both ways will go through me and I will edit anything I think is uncouth, provocative, racist or overtly political. The goal is for the students to find common ground with some friendly westerners, not to create an international incident, or a dispute between me and my employers. If this is something you would be interested in, please contact me through this thread or via PM. I look forward to hearing from you!  
EDIT: Amazing response so far! Thanks so much! So I will let you all know what I am doing. I have sent PMs to those who have expressed an interest. I can accommodate about 12 now for my 2 writing classes, and I have another writing class beginning in a few weeks time. I have had about 8 responses so far, so looking for 4 more for now, and possibly more before October. That would enable me to put the students into groups of 5. If there is much more interest I could make it groups of 4, or even 3 (though that would see me doing a lot of work). Anyway, we shall see...  
RE-EDIT: Wow! Awesome response. I have no received interest from about 15 people, in less than 8 hours! For now it looks like 18 will do, but by all means continue to PM. I am sending PMs back with my email address, asking for a fairly quick response - I want a 100 or so word introduction letter. The first 12 I receive will be distributed to students next week. The next 6 (possibly more), I will distribute in a few weeks when my freshman class begins (they are doing their military training now, poor things). Any further responses, I will do my best to find a correspondent for you. Maybe I can set you up with some of the more gifted students, or see if one of my colleagues would be interested in setting up a similar program. Cheers!  
3rd edit: Wow, more than 50 replies now, through this thread and PM. Thank you all so much! If I can get 20 or more written letters by next Tuesday, I will look at dividing the class into pairs or trios and giving a letter to each. I have already received 6 or 7 letters and I think the students will have a lot of fun and learn a lot about western culture. I am sure they have never heard of disc golf!
4th Edit: I have assigned 10 of you to one of my classes. The next class is advanced so I will make the groups smaller. I think I can find penpals for 14 or 15 of you. I have another writing class starting next week which I can assign 10 more people to. The bad news is that I have received more than 50 letters so some will miss out. I will however, keep your letters and email addresses, and continue to look for penpals for you. I'd like to say again, thank you all so much for your submissions. The students were so happy to receive the letters and I have never seen them working so hard to make sure they made very few grammar errors.

So, before I moved to town, I would send letters and pictures and cards to my grandma. Before she entered senility she often wrote back, but now she doesn't really have the ability of wherewithal to do it (plus I like like 2 miles away from her now). 

But she still *loves* going to her mailbox! The only letters she gets are from her sisters who still live in Wyoming. Otherwise, she just gets bills. I think she would really appreciate if someone send her a letter, and maybe I could help her write you back. 

She's a pip! She's 83 years old. And she insists on going to breakfast every. Single. Day! My parents are leaving the country for a few weeks, starting next week, and my brother, husband, and I will be her chauffeurs. So I'd be able to help her even more! 

She was in the Korean War, I believe. Her father died working on the railroad in the 30's. Her mother raised like 7 kids, and she raised 4. She has stories!

And this is [her](http://i.imgur.com/afsf3Fy.jpg). She has a mama duck living right outside her apartment. They are buddies.

1345055523.0,39,self.penpals,y9vh8,Results of the official /r/Penpals survey!,Herborist,51,12,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/y9vh8/results_of_the_official_rpenpals_survey/,"I'd like to thank all 209 of you that responded – you've all left some great comments and I have read all of them and fully intend to follow your advice. After I list the results, I'll address some of the comments you've made directly and I'll outline how I intend to act on your advice. 

**Of the 209 respondents, 106 (51.2%) were male and 101 (48.8%) were female.** I know that many of you think (and said) that there are far more men here than women, and that is just plain untrue. There are a lot of women here!

**The average age was 23.73. The youngest survey taker was 16, and the oldest was 48.** This may seem dismaying some of the older users – yes, I read all of your comments – and I just want you to know that there are far more of you who are 35+ than you all seem to realize. 

**The most popular country was the United States (surprise, surprise), but Canada and the UK were strong seconds.** Those of you who are worried about /r/Penpals having too few international penpals, know that we received many responses from people in other countries. Just to list a few: France, Spain, Belgium, New Zealand, Venezuela, Portugal, Mexico, and Australia. 

**The most popular method of communicating with penpals was snail mail (letters), but it almost tied with e-mail. IM (usually Skype) was a strong third and only ~15% of you prefer to text.** These results are basically expected (it is /r/*pen*pals after all), but it's nice to know that there are sizable email and IM communities here for those of you who cannot or do not wish to write letters. 

As I said above, I've read all of the comments and there are a few common complaints that I'd like to respond to directly. 

* One of the biggest complaints was that there is a gender gap here and that submissions by women receive far more attention than submissions by men. While it is true that there are more men than women, it's obvious from the survey that that's only barely true. The real issue here is that there are too few comments on posts by men. I can't remedy this directly, but I would encourage everyone and anyone (of any gender) to make themselves more visible. Please comment on submissions directly if they interest you. Upvoting is good, but I think that most people would prefer a comment. It's really nice to read that someone is interested, even if it's a short comment, and it helps a lot to improve morale.

* In the future, if you no longer want any more responses to your submission, please delete the post. A lot of people have said that they try to contact people only to find out that they have enough penpals. I'm not going to manually delete any posts because of this, but I would really appreciate it if you all did. 

* Another common complaint is that people seem to have really poor follow through. You'll correspond once or twice, then completely vanish. I sympathize with those whose lives prevent them from responding often, but please either take the time to tell your penpals that you won't be able to respond anymore (or will be delayed) or think twice before making a submission. Far too many people consider this a novel subreddit, make a post, and then don't take it seriously at all. I don't mean to be the ""fun police"", but it's quite rude to start being someone's penpal and then suddenly stop. 

* Please make sure to direct all submissions that have to do with sex or seeking relationships to the proper subreddit. We're here strictly for *platonic* penpals. If you want to find someone to date, please check the sidebar. Too many people start to lose penpals when they share that they're in a relationship and that is extremely rude. 

And finally, I'm currently in the process of drafting an addition to the sidebar that will encourage people who are new to write more about themselves. A lot of people write almost nothing about themselves and that can be rather annoying to read. I don't mean people who are shy, I mean the people who write ""A/S/L - give me penpal"". A sentence or two is simply not enough. I don't think it's unreasonable for me to ask you to write just a little bit more even if it comes out as a list of things you enjoy doing (which is actually a great way to start). Feel encouraged to talk about yourselves – anyone who harasses you will be dealt with swiftly, so don't fear reporting/PMing the mods. 

I hope you all enjoyed taking the survey as much as I did writing it and reading your responses. I'd like to make a special mention to one person who wrote quite a lot – you know who you are (you wrote the most!) and I'd like to personally thank you for writing such an involved response. It's people like you that make the world a better place to live in.

Now, without further ado, here are some traffic stats on the subreddit.

There's something special about receiving a handwritten letter in the post, meant especially for you. It's a lovely way to spend your time - you can even practice turning that chicken scratch into actual handwriting.

So now, rather than sitting in front of the TV doing nothing, I have a rather large pot of Darjeeling tea, four letters to respond to, and a new penpal to introduce myself to. Rather than spending money on shoes that I don't need, I've found I'm browing stationery websites looking through pretty envelopes. I'm even on first name terms with the people at the post office - it seems there's not many people who ask for 25 airmail stamps at a time.

There's no need for fancy paper, or amazing calligraphy, just your thoughts on paper.

My name is Ramon. I am looking for friends that are willing to share their thoughts as I hope to share mine and hopefully, along the way, many laughs.

I seek honesty above all; ethnicity and age are not factors, however maturity is a factor. I hope to find someone willing to lend an ear and help me escape this reality of confinement and release the frustrations that I endure within these walls.

I can be a friend like no other. I will listen when no one else will, I will lend you an ear if you blow it out I'll have another. I will try to give words of encouragement when you are feeling blue. I will always be here as I hope to find someone that will be there for me too.""

Simply PM me for the address and. Please be nice, the situation he is in is not the easiest, if you'd like to know why he is in feel free to ask him in a letter...

1347142306.0,38,self.penpals,zkox0,A twenty-two year old male from London looking for a very specific sort of e-mail penpal.

It's nice to know so many of you share my sentiments and thought this might be an idea you'd like to try out. Unfortunately as much as I'd like to, I can't try this out with all of you and have already notified those of you as such. However I did get quite a few pm's and I'd implore those of you who did to post in here so you guys can pair up! Thank you again for your interest and I hope you have a fun adventure with whoever you end up sharing your story with.**

**Edit 2: I've had a few pm's suggesting a subreddit for this sort of penpal exchange. Therefore I've created /r/anonymouspals. However I'm not sure how it would exactly work, so I'll make a suggestion thread in that subreddit and you can post your ideas. If there is enough interest, I suppose this would warrant it being it's own subreddit.**

This is quite a specific request as it would most likely only work with someone like minded.

The idea would be to e-mail each other anonymously maybe once a week/fortnight. The catch will be that the e-mails we send will be our own, completely inharmonious with each others. Therefore it wouldn't be so much a conversation between each other via e-mail but more akin to reading someone's own life story. I realize this is quite counter-intuitive when seeking a pen'pal', however I'd liken it the same as growing an attachment to a character in a novel.

Why this sort of penpal specifically? Well I think in normal circumstances you can often speak your mind or tell your story to family/friends/strangers. However I think naturally people perceive this as something that needs to be reciprocated, usually misjudged as someone seeking advice. However some people just want to tell their story. And that's who I'm looking for. The charm of this penpal system is that it allows you to do exactly that. Under the umbrella of anonymity you can speak your mind, talk about your week, your feelings, anything; essentially be able to tell your story without fear of prejudice, judgement or simply having the comfort of knowing you're being listened to without fear of reply. Your reasons are your own.

As a side note, I've made known my a/s/l as I personally don't care for the anonymity of it and don't see it affecting this. Feel free to choose what you disclose in a pm.

Cheers for those who read through this and sorry about the lack of personality in this post. Again it's quite specific and best directed for those people looking for something similar. So if this sounds like something you'd be interested in, shoot me a pm or post a reply in here. I'll only be looking to do this with one person myself, but if there's enough of you I'm sure you can pair up!",,False,,t5_2r076,1347205584.0,,,True,t3_zkox0,http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/zkox0/a_twentytwo_year_old_male_from_london_looking_for/,

I have a question for you.",ThornyAnt,40,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/12m182/you_there_yes_you_the_one_reading_this_i_have_a/,"Are you fed up with receiving merely bills and junk mail in your mailbox? Do you have stacks of writing paper, dozens of envelopes, itch to write but no one to send letters to?

If you answered ´yes´ to any of the above questions, then I have a perfect solution for your problems. Please, continue.

Firstly, Congratulations! (And yes, with a capital letter, because you, my friend are worth it.) 

I´m pleased to inform you of this very special one of a lifetime risk-free opportunity, reserved specially in your name. This is your invitation to become a member of a snail mail club. Exciting? Sure it is? Are you excited? I´m as hell excited! I have never been so excited, well, expect for than one time when... Anyway, think of it as ´The Breakfast Club´ with the exception of meeting in the detention on Saturday morning and we´re three people short from five. But we are total strangers, getting acquainted for the first time and hopefully becoming friends. 

If I happened to pique your curiosity, then you are probably thinking “who is this overly witty and cunning person?” Those who were in search for a male pen pal, then to your misfortune I am female. In disregard of what the well known nursery rhyme states, I´m not made of sugar and spice and everything nice.  I am from Estonia, it´s a state in the Baltic region. I was born during the year when my country regained independence in 1991. This means I´m 21-year-old young adult. During the daytime I´m your ordinary university student and when night-time rolls around I´m your sleep deprived grave-yard shift worker.

Anyway, if you are in a search of a pen pal, and I seem your type of a gal, then leave a comment or PM me. There are not many things in life I can promise, but I can guarantee you my friendship and letters to be found in your mailbox until you are interested. If you like literature (genre doesn´t matter), find history fascinating, aren´t embarrassed to let yourself loose, talk about total nonsense or like to divulge into the matters of life and death then we are the perfect match.

From ~~your~~ your future friend, perhaps?

**NB:** I dare you to write me! I dare you. 

**EDIT:** 
When I was all smiles and dimples, my mother used to call me magpie. She´d always say, *„My sweet little magpie, why do you have to be such a sweetie pie. “* Only once did she tower above me in all her five feet ten inch glory, red-faced from anger, screeching like a banshee, making me quiver like a leaf, demanding me why I had to have a magpie syndrome. I remember this childhood event like it had happened yesterday. It was the first and last time she ever screamed at me. Freddy Krueger himself would have probably quivered under my mother’s wrath and wept like a newborn baby.

You are probably wondering why I am telling you this.  You see, by my nature I´m magpie, I have hard time letting go of things. When I decided to write my pen pal request I didn´t think it would gain much attention, perhaps one or three response. I had low expectations. That´s why I only a couple of hours ago decided to check my Reddit´s account. It´s understatement to say that I was overwhelmed by the warm welcoming I received from all of you. 

Everything I wrote came from bottom of my heart. The truth is that even thou I would love to keep up correspondence with every one of you I don´t have the financial means to buy so many stamps and pay for all the overseas mail. I have watched for the last hour my computer screen, trying to formulate a plan how to pick out pen pals and to whom to say no. Frankly, I´m stumped. 

Right now I need to go to school, but I´ll later respond to every one of you. I just wanted to tell you, that you all have some interesting qualities, you all seem lovely people and I wish that in some alternative universe I would get to know you all. As a magpie, I hate saying no, especially to people.

You are all lovely!
I wish you all good luck!

She told me all about how it's been the past 8 months for her, about the people, their customs and food and appearance and attitudes -- about teaching the children -- about their country, its infrastructure, and the presence of its soviet history, among other sentiments, personal &amp; so on.

I already feel much better.",ShldBeSleeping,35,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/ubjct/hmmm_no_replies_in_that_case_im_sending_a_letter/,"(As the momentary excitement of beating all levels of tower defense on hard passes) Wow... I need some friends. Stupid summer in a college town.

And so, here I am in r/penpals. Rather than waiting for somebody to ask me to chat or send them an e-mail. I'm sending a letter to all of you. It's my life story.

My tale begins in Idaho, in a small town of around 3,000 where I was raised the youngest boy of 6 children (brady bunch style: g,b,g,b,g,B &lt;-- me!). There is a 6 year gap between me and my next sibling, so I grew up mostly entertaining myself. I was always a curious kid. I spent almost every day outside catching bugs or breaking open rocks. That curiosity extended into my school years, and I was always a straight A student. 

The problem was I was also a nerd. I parted my hair sideways untill the 8th grade and never really had many friends. Actually when I say ""not many"" thats just a euphemism for zero, but anyways, that didn't last forever. I finally decided that I hated my lonely life and decided to make changing myself a scientific endeavor. I forced myself to be social and found a way to embrace my insecurities rather than try to hide them. Thanks to the good fortune of meeting some really great people, I enjoyed the last 3 years of high school and my freshman year of college. 

Now, pause character development for some critical background. I grew up in a very religious mormon family, and something that mormons guys do when they turn 19 is go out and proselyte for 2 years. Now the town where I grew up is almost entirely mormon, so this was something I always planned to do, and I did in fact do it. I served in the Washington DC area, and became fluent in Spanish.

 This is where things get complicated though. As I was out there, knocking doors and talking to strangers, my curious and scientific mind couldn't help but notice a few things. The first among which was that the world is full of awesome, kind, and interesting people. Many of these people were in all honesty happier with life than I think I ever will be. I saw that rather than me being the one with something to offer the world, I had so much more to learn from everyone around me. I saw that no matter what ethnic or religious background a person had, they seemed to have equal potential to be awesome. I'm sure that's probably very obvious to you, but for me growing up, I was always taught that happines was directly related to one's faith and obedience to the principles of religion. Intrigued by this, I logged it away and finished my 2 years of service. 

Fast forward again, and now I'm back in school studying engineering, and in my freetime studying psychology, neuroscience, and any and all studies relating to the impact of religion on human behavior. After about a year. I started to feel that when people judge others based on religious differences, its sort of like two people hating each other because they couldn't agree if Wolverine wears boxers or briefs. It's ultimately irrelavant to a person's character, and can't be proven either way. These views led me to give up religion entirely. 

Now it all ties together. Deciding to abandon my faith caused a huge backlash in my life. It basically destroyed almost every significant relationship I had, and left me in many ways socially crippled. It sent me right back to my 7th grade memories of lunch period. I was speed walking everywhere trying to look like I hadsomeplace to go; someplace with people who actually cared that I woke up that morning. Rather than being able to talk to random people on the bus, I felt like a downed U.S. pilot in Nazi Germany, trying to evade capture by blending into the background and keeping a pebble in my shoe to remind me to fake a limp. I felt like if anybody knew that I didn't believe what the vast majority of those around me did, that I would be completely rejected. As a defense mechanism, I just started to withdraw from people. I buried myself in my studies and became almost robotic in my relationships with others. I was all business. If I was with students, I talked about assignments, grades, projects, never anything personal. If I was at work, I just put in my headphones and worked. No chit-chat, nothing unrelated to the task at hand. 

Now here I am. Having lived like this for about a year. I have successfully isolated myself, and now I have a bad case of the be-careful-what-you-wish-for's. There is litterally nobody alive who truly understands who I am. Most of my old friends would recognize me by face alone, because everything else about me is fundamentally changed. I like who I've become, but I desperately need to find a way to connect with people again. To those of you who read this, I've actually never told my story start to finish to anybody, so whether you've met me or not, you know me better than my own family, and I consider you my friends.

The point: Prove to me that the world is still full of awesome people. Tell me your stories, and help me learn to be social again

I like all kinds of music, cars and motorcycles, was raised around them and still love them. I don't care about race or gender, I am open to anyone who is looking to share a friendship.

I love to read, and my favourite author is James Lee Burke. I love dogs and cats, not so much a fan of rats or hamsters.
I would love to hear from you soon. Like I say I am straight up and all I ask is that you are too as I get my life turned around. I am taking some programs to help me get out of hear sooner and hope to learn a trade to help my transition easier.
Hope to hear from you soon, and I promise I will write back quickly.

Before you jump out to say, ""slow down there, Speedy. Maybe they just need a little more time."" Well here's the thing; since the last letter I've written, I have waited *months* for a reply.  

It just seems like the people who sought out pen pals never had the intention to follow through. Why waste our time like that?

Here's me tooting my own horn. I've never snubbed anyone that wrote to me.

Date of release:  2045-06-21 

I am looking for a penpal who knows how to be a friend. I am straight and don't play games. I love football, The Houston Texans are my and and yes I am from Houston born and raised. I like all kinds of music, cars and motorcycles, was raised around them and still love them. I don't care about race or gender, I am open to anyone who is looking to share a friendship. I don't have much of a family, I do have kids but my ex-wife doesn't let them see me. In '01 my brother passed, then in '02 my parents went. You could say I am the black sheep of the family. I love to read, and my favourite author is James Lee Burke. I love dogs and cats, not so much a fan of rats or hamsters. 

I would love to hear from you soon. Like I say I am straight up and all I ask is that you are too as I get my life turned around. I am taking some programs to help me get out of hear sooner and hope to learn a  trade to help my transition easier. 

Hope to hear from you soon, and I promise I will write back quickly.

I'm as spry as the day I left my mother's womb, but if you must know I am in fact 22 years, 5 months, and 22 days old. For fun I create artistic masterpieces, and compose music that would make Mozart himself weep. During the afternoons I box my pet bear Bosco, and finish off with my daily tree throwing exercises. I don't have a job. I instead choose to lend a small portion of my time to those who could benefit from my outstanding skills. In return they praise me with various donations of money. As far as what my mailing preferences are; there is only one answer, and I leave it up to you to figure out. Choose wisely.

Personality:

- Mature for my age. Now, before someone says, ""All immature teenagers say that!"", I would like to quote my vice-proncipal, who said that I'm ""like an adult trapped in a teenage body; you should be finishing University this year, not high school.""

- Outside of the box thinker; I've always been different, but in a good way

- Intelligent, but not the constantly-stating-facts-that-are-completely-inaccurate-kind

- Philosophical

- Funny, but I have a dark sense of humour

A Few Interests:

- Guitar; I mostly listen to and play Alternative and Indie Rock

- Photography, Drawing and Painting

- I just started Longboarding, and mostly do freestyle (i.e. tricks)

- The Outdoors. I'm always happiest when out in nature :)

- And, of course, Video Games

( I was a dog person for about ten minutes once when I held a pug but that was a moment of madess) I reside in a town in England where people go to die or be racist. (I don't want to do either of those things, so I'm very unpopular) I'm scared of horses. I'm working class. I guess I'm a feminist. I have all my own teeth, but I'm British, so they're the stuff of your nightmares. I lived behind the sofa once for three weeks, only emerging for glasses of Cresta and to watch Pet Rescue.

I made a post on /r/penpals a while back about a one time card exchange that was moderately successful.  (You can take a look [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/xswb8/22fusa_making_cards_for_anyone_who_wants_them_one/)).  It actually inspired me to create /r/randomactsofcards.    

I thought maybe some of you might want to venture over there as well for those who like to give or get snail mail.  My posts are already filled, but there are two other offers up already: one that's offering to make cards for [10](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/1b8ij6/willing_to_make_and_send_10_cards_to_anyone/) people and one that's offering to make them for [5](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsofCards/comments/1bd4zc/im_willing_to_make_5_cards_anywhere/). So right away you already know you'll be getting something in the mail, and you can offer to make them a card back. Or, if you want, make your own post and pay it forward and make an offer to someone else.  

So if you wanted an easier, hassle free way to exchange mail then why not take a look.  You might even be able to pick up a penpal that way too. :)

Essentially we will create a small little ""stanley"" (I was thinking instead of using their template for Stanley we use a reddit alien) and mail him around the world to different people. We can set up a mailing list or something like that on r/penpals and send him down the list. Once you would receive him, take pictures with him around your town or city or house,you're favorite place,anywhere you can think of, post those online and then send it to the next person to do the same! The more people that want to do it and the farther away you are the better. 

I did this many years ago in my 3rd grade class and sent them across the country and it was really fun. I can't imagine how awesome it would be to go global with this. 

Does this sound like a good idea to anyone? We could keep it going for say a year or so and see how many places he can make it too and see all the amazing pictures with each person.

Edit: ok so it looks like there's a good interest in doing this. I'm in class right now but tonight we can get a list going with names and addresses of where it's going. Tell anyone you know that would like to join and let's make it grow even bigger! 

Edit 2: So sorry everyone after my class last night I just went to sleep. Just a heads up this is still going on you can still sign up. Im not sure yet how we are going to set up the mailing list, either on reddit, facebook or some way through email. Or just write down everyones address included with the alien and just send it to the next person on the list?

Edit 3: We have a set plan! So we are just going to have the usernames on a list included with the alien, whoever is in possession of the alien PM the next person on the list asking their address and that way everyone only gives their address to one person and not a list being sent around the world.

They leave a sticky mess wherever they go, it's terrible. I only use their mail because they run a good service. 

Anyway, I'm looking for penpals from anywhere in the world provided you can speak English. I'd love to try writing in another language but I'd probably end up saying something very rude being told it was something polite or some other kind of awkward sitcom social situation. And I'm Irish and can't even speak my own language, so give me a break.

I was a little worried that if I were to write my little introduction like this that it would end up as just a list of likes (I like ice cream) and then I would get a response from someone saying 'I like ice cream too' and then I would say 'oh' and they would say 'do you like vanilla' and I would say 'kinda' and they would say 'oh' and I would say 'oh', and that that'd be it for my attempts at social interaction. So I'm not writing it like that, instead aiming for how I speak because most people speak. Although if you're mute I can still write to you. 

What I will say is that I like lots of things. I like to read, dividing attention between fantasy and sci-fi with classics old and new from around the world, and I'd consider myself a pretty serious reader. This bleeds into writing because as you can see, I love to write. It's a powerful way to beam yourself inside someone's mind and hopefully find a comfortable home there. I like movies, although I have this awful problem where I stop watching a movie partway, even if I'm enjoying it, just because I can't really share it with others. So I haven't seen as many movies as I would like, but I'd love to take recommendations from others and talk about them. 

I love music, naturally enough. Right now I'm listening to Belle and Sebastian, Daughter, Foals, The Postal Service and various post-rocky things I really like. I enjoy acting and video games (Ace Attorney, Persona, Kingdom Hearts, Sam and Max) too. Although if you don't know or don't like any of those things, that's fine. Above all I'm looking for long, possibly-rambling, possibly-strange conversations, something that seems worthwhile. If your life doesn't seem interesting to me, and my life doesn't seem interesting to you, we can just tell each other lies. 

So yeah, there's a sales pitch on my character. Message me if you'd like, or want to give me constructive criticism on my personality if you are the kind of person who would do that. 

EDIT: I didn't expect to get as many replies as I did, so it's going to take me a little while (or a long while...) to formulate personal responses, I don't want to reply generically to anyone.

* I'm reading over what I've written and I'm realising that I sound like a sombre old man. I CALL FELONY. I love talking to people and being around friends, loving life and not taking things too seriously.

* I luuurve public speaking and act a lot. I enjoy being the centre of attention without being a complete douche about it. I'm really good at accents! :D

* Yes, yes, music, movies and all the rest of it. I'm beginning to realise that this post is becoming pretty long so I won't elaborate on them until asked. Avid PC gamer too. I'm horrible at art. My best artistic creation would look something like [this.](http://ifyouwannasingoutsingout.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/shittypic.jpg)seeing all these artistic redditors makes me feel like a boulder compared to a Rosser Reeves Ruby.

So anyway, it's be sweet if we like, chat about stuff. Y'know, anything stuff. Stuffy stuff. I don't care who you are or how old you are.  I'll send you a picture of me if you want. I've been told that I'm attractive, but they may just be trying to get to my non-existent money. &gt;.&gt;

23 years old. Master's student at Georgetown. Musicphile. Dog lover (but kitties are cute). Aquarius. I love to read, I love to write. My nose is always in a book.

I'm a semi-polyglot, I speak the majority of the Romance Languages. I'm also addicted to traveling - it's a high for me. I can't stay still for more than 6 months. I've been to a lot of places in the world but I still have more to do. And here are a couple of things from my bucket list:



See at least 3 of the ten world wonders before turning 30

Get my PhD

Learn to read music and subsequently play the cello

Meet someone famous

Learn to tango

Learn to drive a motorcycle

Adopt a corgi (yes, I'm obsessed with /r/corgi)

I've a tremendous and huge favor to ask. There is someone I hold very dear to me, someone I will probably remember til the day I die. I had a unique way of giving her gifts on her birthdays; after a total mess-up the first one. Every year since the first birthday we starting dating, I'd surprise and outdo the gift the previous year. On the 2nd birthday of being with her I called in the library from the city that shared her name (she has quite a unique name imo) and had an article printed and laminated from the day we first started dating. On the third birthday of our relationship, I called in every town/city in every state sharing her name; having spoken with the respective Mayors of each city, and believe me, I was more than excited that they all agreed to write something personal in honor of her birthday. All 5 Mayors from each city wrote and sent something so wonderful for her. And this year, I want to outdo myself once again. Although we've parted ways, she has a fine appreciation for genuine penmanship and snail mail, and despite our odds and ends that let to a bittersome ending, she appreciates it. 

She's been through a really rough patch, and although I can't do much, the best I can do is indirectly show her optimism from people all around the world, and not simply see it using the views from people around her. I would absolutely love if you guys, and it doesn't matter who/whom, could write her postcards/letters wishing her a marvelous birthday that's coming up (in about 2 weeks).  I am willing to pay postage for most if it'll be troublesome for you guys. Please let me know, as this would make me feel at ease to some extent. I want her to receive most of these letters at least the day before or on her birthday. PM for details if you're interested.

Thanks!

Hi everyone! As the title suggests, I'm looking to meet some new people from around the world.

A bit about me: I'm 19, currently on summer holidays from University. I'm a 2nd year student doing with Graphic Design. I live in the south island of New Zealand. Aside from Uni, I like photography and spending time outside. I do a bit of tramping (hiking) with my family. I spend way too much time in the internet (reddit, facebook and art blogs) and have a healthy obsession with my cats. After my degree finishes, I have the intention of travelling in the UK and Europe and possibly America/Canada too so it would be cool to talk with people who live overseas who I can maybe meet one day. I love listening to music too: Radiohead, Arctic Monkeys, Black Keys, Grizzly Bear and Fleet Foxes. Some of my favourite tv shows are Breaking Bad, GOT, Friends, Downton Abbey, The IT Crowd and Black Books. I also like doing crafty things and making bits and pieces, so I can post you some treats. I'm sure there's more things that I can't think of right now...

Any who, feel free to PM me. I'm open to post, email and skype so whichever suits you. I look forward to your mail!

Maybe another Filipino has the same hopes for their Lolo/Lola...,SocialSoundSystem,22,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/11k4lm/what_if_im_looking_for_a_penpal_for_my_88yr_old/,"My Lola is 88 years old. She's been going through some stuff and I gave her a call tonight. I had a 45 minute call with her today and she really opened up when we started talking about the Philippines. My mom says that her doctor says that she needs a friend to communicate with and perhaps a Filipino friend would help. 

I think she grew up in Laguna province but also spent a great deal of time in Manila where her father was a lawyer with his practice above his hardware store. During WWII and the Japanese occupation she worked with the guerillas &amp; other subversive forces delivering messages. After the war she went back to university to become a teacher &amp; professor. During Marcos' rule they began to move the family to the US where she became a teacher in Los Angeles eventually moving the whole family here with the hopes of a better life.

She now lives in San Diego (Oceanside), CA. Lately she's been going through some stuff and her doctor says she's too isolated. She needs a friend, perhaps a Filipino friend, who she can talk with or relate too. I talked with her on the phone for 45 minutes tonight... At first she wasn't really coherent but as we started talking about the big family reunion she had yesterday, her brothers &amp; sisters, and about life in the Philippines she really started to open up. 

Apparently she has already written her entire life story but she can't remember it now. But as soon as I started talking about her past, she really started to open up. I need to go visit her so that she can give me the book to digitize and publish for the family.

Maybe another Filipino grandchild has the same hopes for their Lolo/Lola... Worth a shot. In other news, I'm making a recurring calendar reminder to call her more and buying her a new blank book to write things down in so she can remember.

TL; DR: My Filipina Lola is 88 and needs someone to communicate with, stimulate her social skills, and remember the Philippines. [EDIT: hopefully someone from her generation]

I can talk to people, we get long just fine, but I prefer to live in my own little bubble. I'm a creative person and I just get more done that way. 360-ish days out of the year I keep to myself. 

In a city of 8 million people it's easy to be forgotten. To be another face in the crowd. I am more than that though. I'm more than an unknown face. I have thoughts and feelings too. I have hopes, dreams and wishes. I, like every other human, yearns for a connection. The connection one can only have with another human. It's the catalyst for friendships, lovers, acquaintances and even enemies. Yet, today...and tomorrow I lack any connection. 

I am alone, for the third year in a row. 

It isn't that I have no family. I just spend my holidays making sure other families Christmas goes well. I'm the one people call on at work to yell at when their package hasn't arrived or is missing a pair of batteries. I'm the emotional punching bag that's been set up that makes it okay for someone to yell at a complete stranger...and I didn't even know you existed until a moment prior to your call.

I'm on the other end of the phone when you yell and cry that I ruined your Christmas and all I can ever think of when I hear you bitch and moan is telling you ""I WISH I could fucking see my family for just one holiday."" 

That never happens though and instead I end up alone again on Christmas Eve, jealous of my morbidly obese roommate who even waddled his half ton body to see his family. I sit alone in my room, eating rice and clutching a can of beans...it's the only connection I have now to my family and my Latin upbringing.

Basically, my brother in law, Sam, is in prison for the next 4 years. While I know he enjoys getting letters from me and his brother, it would be nice if he also had someone else to correspond with. 

Ill go ahead and lay out his charge, since I know that is going to be the number one question. 

7 or so years ago he shot someone in their ass. He came home to his young daughter locked in her bedroom, and his wife having sex with someone on their bed.  The guy he shot lived, and had no complications, other than having a bullet in his bum. 

Sam was put on probation with a suspended sentence, and if he violated his probation, he went to prison. When his ex wife got wind that he had attended an out of county funeral, she called his PO, and that leaved me here, asking someone to have the heart to write to him.

About Sam: He is a country and gospel musician. [Here is his myspace music page](http://www.myspace.com/samjackson01)

Before he was sent to prison, Sam was working on opening a church for the ""Un-church like people"". He was working with a group of members that helped ex felons, homeless, addicts, etc find resources, jobs, clothes, and worship if they were inclined to wanting it. 

I know that I bias, because he is my brother in law, but I'm hoping that just one person out there will have the heart to write to him.

this is a calling for anyone who would like a very creative and geeky pen pal. I have been writing to him for almost three years and he has enriched my life with his jokes, art and thoughtfulness. He is a big fan of sci-fi, D&amp;D, Yu-Gi-Oh Cards, and anime.

August is a prisoner in California, I will not disclose his charge here, but he has been down for over eleven years and has completely missed the evolution of gaming or the Internet - two things he would have been heavily involved in otherwise. Yet he still experienced the earlier end of it and used to frequent Ultima Online before he was sentenced in 2001.

August is a gentle, kindhearted fellow who would appreciate any connection you make with him - whether you write a letter for him to reply to, or send him art to treasure and respond in kind. I assure you it's been quite a humorous and interesting journey for me getting to know him. He has sent me oodles of his beautiful sketches and some water-colours, and doodles contextual cartoons on the sides of his text. I still write him, but correspondence between us takes a minimum of 5 weeks, and I feel bad for him waiting all that time for any mail.

[Here](http://www.writeaprisoner.com/Template.aspx?i=z-t72316) is his WriteAPrisoner profile, which contains his address. And [here](http://i.imgur.com/GEMBECN.jpg) is a snippet of his most recent letter to me, after I offered posting him on here as an alternative to upgrading his profile for $150, that he would have to save for months to afford.

- I'm a butcher by trade, but psychology is my game. I'm a second year uni student, who also works full time.

- I enjoy documentaries, history books and films. You'll often find me watching the history, nature or crime channels; or with my head stuck in a book, usually a biography.

- I'm a lover of all things musical. Genre isn't a word I use when it comes to my love for sound. I like various artists from The Smiths to Metallica. (Morrissey knows the way to my soul.)

- I love all the usual feminine type things, such as: hair, fashion, make up, shopping, coffee dates, writing, romcoms and chocolate. (Why haven't I been able to find a female friend!?!)

- I like to talk, a lot. When I say a lot, I mean a lot. I'll talk about anything and everything from the weather to deep and meaningful topics.

- I would love to snail mail, however if you prefer electronically, I do have skype.

Hopefully another girl out there is keen for a decent chat and a possible friend.

I'd love to find some people to write to, anywhere in the world. I'll tell you a bit about me and if you think you might like to write then that'd be ace!

So, I'm 20, in my last undergraduate year of Psychology, applying for a doctorate so I can go the full whack. I'm a pretty full-on academic, I tend to work really hard (although bit apathetic at the moment because hey, it's the holidays, and I want wine more than I want to write a paper).

I'm a cheerleader. Not particularly common in the UK I guess but I really enjoy it, it keeps me nice and fit. I'm on a little squad that only does stunting, and I'm pretty proud of what we can do.

I'm a gym nut when I want to be, but my greatest love is food. It's always been said that the way to my heart is through my stomach.

When I'm stressed, I bake brownies. I bake some really ace brownies. They're also the only thing I can cook, I'm pretty sure I can even screw up omelettes.

I work for a crisis line, answering telephones, texts, and emails. Maybe that sounds depressing but I adore my shifts and the people I get to talk to. It helps keep my problems in perspective!

I work in a student bar, I can be a bit crazy, always dancing around and having a laugh with the customers. I was crazy shy before that but now I'm a right chatterbox. I've been told by my customers and co-workers that I'm the happiest person they've ever met, and I guess I try to be! I feel bad if I'm grumpy (which I think is frequent but no-one else seems to notice ha).

So uhm, that's a brief summary of me at the moment!

tl;dr student psychologist, cheerleader, bar tender, I know a great brownie recipe.

Please let me know if you think we could write to one another.

At /r/anonymouspals you have an opportunity to penpal in an unique way. The idea would be to e-mail/send a letter to each other anonymously maybe once a week/fortnight. The catch will be that the e-mails/letters you send will be your own, completely inharmonious with one another. Therefore it wouldn't be so much a conversation between one another but more akin to reading someone's own life story. It seems quite counter-intuitive when seeking a pen'pal', however I'd liken it the same as growing an attachment to a character in a novel.


**Why?**

Usually in normal circumstances you can often speak your mind or tell your story to family/friends/strangers. However naturally people perceive this as something that needs to be reciprocated, usually misjudged as someone seeking advice. However some people just want to tell their story. The charm of this penpal system is that it allows you to do exactly that.


As charmingly put to me in a pm:

*""It's like writing a diary but knowing someone will be laughing when you write a clever joke, crying when you write about your loss, and secretly judging you when you get heated over petty things.*

*It's like listening to someone talk to them self and making comments that they can't hear. You'll be frustrated that your advice is unheard but it'll be so satisfying to watch them finally come to a conclusion on their own.*

*You likened it to a novel. After a while we could flip through the emails/letters and look at it as a chronicle, watching our protagonist grow or decline in real time.""*

I took a second and evaluated my expectations of a penpal... and here's what I've come up with.  A [F] penpal, first of all.  What I imagine would be nice is girly writing with silly hearts for dots over I's, on pink stationary sprayed with perfume.  I think the last time I had a penpal like this was almost 13 years ago, while I was away at basic training.  

You know what else?  I haven't ordered picture prints in almost six years.  I want this as a reason to do that, too.  

A little about me: I've decided the best life plan to have is [no plan at all](http://i.imgur.com/fUmGR.jpg).  It's taken the last decade of my life to realize... I'd better slow down and enjoy the ""now"", instead of worrying how I'm doing compared to someone else.  

Here's the stuff that would go on a resume: I worked at a bicycle shop in [High School](http://i.imgur.com/GXkTJ.jpg), and I'm still an [avid rider](http://i.imgur.com/Py1Jf.jpg).  I [joined the Air Force at 17](http://i.imgur.com/8ffyo.jpg) to be an Air Traffic Controller--before 9/11.  I changed jobs and worked as a bona fide mechanic until the end of my enlistment in the Air Force.  I took a ""break"" and worked as a civilian mechanic for a few years, and joined the Army through the flight program--to be a helicopter pilot.  BUUUT I screwed that up and got myself suspended, and picked a different job--combat medic.  I'm a certified EMT and Soldier.  ...an *Expert* field medic, in fact.  I qualified for the Army's most prestigious specialty badge within two months of being a brand new medic.  [I was in the paper for it.  that's my nose on the left! hah](http://www.kdhnews.com/news/story.aspx?s=43663)  

I still enjoy working on cars... especially my car.  [Clutch replacement](http://imgur.com/a/lvKMb) from [this weekend.](http://imgur.com/a/Kvfpl)  

About being an Army pilot:  some things are a great idea, and respectable... but require maturity that I naturally [*lack*](http://i.imgur.com/K1254.jpg).  and it would involve a lot of time away.  I don't believe in God, or fate, or a divine will... but I think it was a fortunate turn of events.  [rock on~](http://i.imgur.com/0djhQ.jpg)  

I've deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan, and a friendly oil-rich country called Qatar.  I'll talk about it, no problem... but I don't think it's cool anymore.  Maybe it's something I had to get out of my system.  [This is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/cXRcB.jpg) I sent my [little sisters](http://i.imgur.com/z9CuV.jpg) over Facebook while I was in Iraq.  I wanted them to know I was ok.  I made an extra effort to keep my status updates positive and upbeat.  ...for them.

I'm about to leave the military once again, and I'm moving back to my hometown to pursue a degree in... either structural engineering, or materials engineering--something that will put me in front of a drafting board, and have me working in CAD.  It's a compromise between a technical job that will bring me income, and what I *really* want to do, which is be an artist.  [here's something](http://i.imgur.com/T2Yc1.jpg) from my sketchbook in Iraq.  [another.](http://i.imgur.com/31g1Y.jpg)  ...the rest of this picture is not PG-13, nor are most of my drawings.  *I don't show them to just anyone.* :-D  A [stylized picture](http://i.imgur.com/5e8xj.jpg) of a [friend from HS.](http://i.imgur.com/pkkWg.jpg)  ...[and another.](http://i.imgur.com/GLGG3.jpg)

I would love to just say the hell with other people's expectations, and leave for South America to sketch and paint for the rest of my life... but... my parents will be disappoint.  I'm [half Korean](http://i.imgur.com/wjq91.jpg), see...  

I'm also divorced.  I was 24, and I eloped with my [tall, leggy, 18-yr old](http://i.imgur.com/0PmxA.jpg) girlfriend to get married in Vegas--Ceasar's Palace, in fact.  I'm kinda proud of having done that--something so monumentally immature.  I rode my motorcycle there and back.  

So I'm going off to live with friends.  Four of us, in our own house, with a [sweet old grandmother](http://i.imgur.com/t0jCA.jpg).  We take care of the place, and her, and pay rent.  It's a fantastic arrangement, one where we have no incentive to go and do ""adult"" things like start a family or career.  There's a garage full of [our fast cars](http://i.imgur.com/dWYa2.jpg), and [loud motorcycles](http://i.imgur.com/5J1lU.jpg)... and any weekend is liable to become a story like [The Hangover](http://i.imgur.com/ATfNo.jpg).  We'll just [go to Vegas](http://i.imgur.com/2XrMr.jpg) if nothing else is going on that weekend....  

Just today, the thought occurred to me... why not volunteer with a Boy Scout troop?  I used to be one.  The only dilemma I have is, would being a role model convince young impressionable minds that the military is a good idea... because I believe *I* turned out ok, but many do not.  It's not... the best profession.  

Anyway.  [I'm a fitness nut?](http://i.imgur.com/vjm3U.jpg)  Not sure what to call it, exactly.  Ever since I joined the Army I've developed a habit of pushing myself physically--at one time, I couldn't do 30 pushups or situps, and my 2-mile run time was over the maximum allowed time for my age group.  Now?  80 of each, and my latest 2-mile was in 11:35--and I know I'm going to get faster.  I think the next area of improvement is my stride.  

I [*love*](http://i.imgur.com/HjfnR.jpg) [computers](http://i.imgur.com/enjjI.jpg), [computer](http://i.imgur.com/vvVfh.jpg) games, the internet, ...and... [I play EVE](http://i.imgur.com/reJdb.jpg).  [how could I not?](http://i.imgur.com/R8dUq.jpg)  I would play Aion for the graphics, too, but EVE has a game mechanic that lets me improve my characters without having to be at the computer.  Thank goodness for that, because while I was away in Iraq, my characters were still doing stuff.  

I used to be a fatty.  I have the [/r/loseit](/r/loseit) [post](http://i.imgur.com/xP5by.jpg) to prove it.  hah.  I've found being fit on *purpose* has made me stronger and healthier than I was in my teens... and I think the whole ""age=slower"" belief is a lie people tell themselves when they get lazy... physically *and* mentally.  

Overall impression that people get of me, I think, is that [I'm full of myself](http://i.imgur.com/ucVCK.jpg).  But I'm not.  I'm only competitive with myself, and I think people just don't understand that I want to... [live a good life](http://i.imgur.com/qvuqS.jpg).

I was thinking about doing this with my friends around the US, but there would probably be more people on here interested. I figured I would write my address in a book and send it to person 1. It would come with a note telling them who to send it to next. So, person 1 sends it to person 2 with a note containing 3's address. 

The previous person always decides who reads it next. That way when it gets to you, you know somebody is waiting to receive it. It encourages the book to keep moving. And if you're at the end of the line, cant find anyone else interested in the book, my address is in there and you send it back.

Maybe we could get a few of these going with different genres. Personally, I like nonfiction books about successful people. Maybe we can come up with a way to build the network of people too. Getting people to know each other and all the benefits of friendship. 



** I made a subreddit for this /r/booknet if you like the idea of sharing in that style, anything books or otherwise please join and start your own sharing network.

I'll be working on that sub tonight or tomorrow. I hope you all join!

Hi there,
First, let me introduce myself. My name is Liviu, i'm 21 and i live in Romania (eastern Europe, just in case you didn't know). I'm in college, second year studying naval electronic engineering (i hope that's how it's called in english). I enjoy listening to old rock bands (there's no need to name them, if you're into it you allready know what i'm talking about) but i'm not against new ones either. As for movies, horror and sci-fi ar my favourites but that doesn't stop me from enjoying any other good movies. I even started to watch Korean and other Asian dramas. It's crazy, i know, but that's me. Well, enough about myself cause if i say more here there won't be much to say in letters.

I'm looking for 2 maybe 3 penpals. I prefer them to be female (no offence dudes) because even if i understand ''male language'' (few words, 2-3 potatos and some dirty talking ; even if that explains alot), i want long letters and females do that the best (and i'll do my best to keep up with that amount of words). I'm not looking for anything dirty, creepy or any other stuff that we both don't agree. I just want someone to talk to, find out more about them, their culture, the country they live in and things like that. I wish i could find someone from Asia, someone from America (not just the country) and Africa (in fact, from any country that ain't mine, or Spain; no offence but i visit Spain almost every year). I don't mind if they are all from Asia (or other continent) but from different countries. My english aint even close to perfect, ok, ok, not even close to good but i'll improve myself, maybe with your help.

I know this is a fresh account but please don't find it as an obstacle on the road our future pen-friendship. I'm looking forward to hear from you. Please leave a comment with a few words.

May the force be with all of you!

I am very active and enjoy long (2-3 mile) walks and lifting. 

I'm a tarot card reader and a medium, though I only make money doing tarot. The ghost thing
is more of something that is a part of my everyday life. I was raised by a family of women who all did the same sort of thing, though, so it's very much a family tradition. 

I was formerly an east-asian style hostess in bars, before the PTSD set in and I had to retire.
This sounds a little unreal, but I live in the south pacific. Hostessing is not an uncommon profession here, even if it is somewhat stigmatized. I worked in clubs that catered to filipino overseas foreign workers and first and second generation immigrants. 

I've been bipolar since I was 10. I deal with it really well, though, and for the most part it no longer negativly impacts my quality of life. However, it is a huge part of my identity, because I experience it and 
deal with it (mostly in positive ways!) everyday. I resist heavy medication and am a pretty 
huge advocate for bipolar self awareness and alternative therapys as a compliment to medication and traditional talk therapy. 

I love movies and comic books, though I usually don't combine the two :) My favourite movie is the Ninth Gate and my absolute favourite title of all time is Hellblazer. I love occult themes and overall dark themes in my entertainment. 

I use various substances recreationally. I believe I'm not addicted to any one of them because I'm pretty honest with my therapists about my usage, and while not thrilled, they do admit I don't meet any criteria for addiction to any substance. I use substance to explore the universe in my own mind, to see things differently and to experience things. 

My other guilty pleasure is mysterious things -- especially those rooted in antiquity or that are just truly bizarre. I like weird things because they stimulate my brain and that's not something that I get to experience very often these days. 

I currently live with my boyfriend and his family. I have a three year old daughter I lost in a custody thing when I was homeless, but I'm on great terms with my parents and see her all the time. My boyfriend is very good for me, but he's the strong and silent type so we don't talk about all the things I would like very much to discuss with people. For most intents and purposes, I'm a house-girlfriend. I kind of hate it but, again, wicked bad PTSD.
  

I'm looking for people who are a little unique as well; people who feel misunderstood and have minds full of -stuff- they just want to share and delight in having stuff shared with them. I'm looking for someone who is interested in sharing and caring about one another -- I'm looking for someone who knows what its like to be judged, to be on the other side of the tracks, to struggle and live despite people looking down on you for them. If you're brave enough to be yourself (or are trying to be), we'll be great friends. 

I have a filthy whore mouth and I don't want to filter my stories or experiences in anyway at all. 

I would like to email and then eventually skype :)

We meet new people everyday and when we do we make assumption about that person based on their gender, clothes, race, age and so on.  
We see these surface attributes and we make assumptions about that person; we write their life story for them in our minds.

Let's try something a little different, I'm looking for a very special person to swap handwritten letters – entirely anonymously. 
Initially;
I don't want to know your age.
I don't want to know your gender.
I don't want to know what you look like.
I don't want to know your job or if you even have one.

Try to avoid anything you'd feel would allow me to  categorise you.

But then you're thinking, 'geeez that really limits what I can write about..'

But it doesn't.

Have you ever received a message from someone like that? When you read it, you think you know the person, you make a guess about all those surface attributes but you're not sure, you're never sure until they explicitly tell you. 

In my limited experience, this forces you to actually read and value the content of the message itself rather than focus on the motivations of the person behind it.  

This allows us to get past basics and talk about what the world is really like from your point of view. Let's be a little cliqued and call it the TylerDurden Writing scheme.

the goals here are
a: to get to know someone in a very unique way, and
b: find new music

after a while i think it would be fun to have a chat or text exchange of some kind and try to describe to one another what we think the other personality is like, based on the expressions of music. submissions could be significant songs from your past, moods that describe you, or whatever. any type of music would be acceptable (i have wide tastes).

i would *prefer* a female because i'm generally more comfortable interacting with girls. but being this is so different i'd be willing to try it with a dude too.

______________________________

**EDIT 1** update: so i went through the whole thing with one redditor last night and it turned out to be a pretty remarkable experience. we exchanged 10 songs each, one at a time, and at the end sparked up chat with each other and took a wild stab at what the other person was trying to communicate about themselves. we both agreed that we were about 90% accurate with one another or better, even. it then turned into a fantastic conversation for a few hours. much better than your typical, a/s/l, where you from, shit. in fact those things were never discussed.

anyway - i have received a couple other responses so i will definitely continue to do this. it may take a few days though. but if you've read this thread and thought about doing this, even not with me, you should. audio pals needs to be a new thing.

I've tried a couple of these in the past. Two never responded at all and one did for a while but hasn't for several months.

A little about me; I have written as a Freelance Writer for PC Gamer Magazine, I am halfway to finishing my Private Pilot's License, I'm studying Maths, Chemistry, Physics and Computing at College with hopes to join a start-up as a programmer and I live in Oxford, UK.  

In my spare time I play Magic: The Gathering, watch Starcraft II as an eSport, occasionally cook, cycle around the countryside and plan dream trips around the world. I am extrememly geeky but that is no bad thing as I struggle to find something I have zero interest in at all. 

I should mention that I am looking to write to a female. As my Penpal, you should expect me to open up and ask for advice every so often 
and I struggle to be this open around guys. I'm more than happy to do International post! 

What you should expect from me:

* Several-thousand word letters
* Quick responses
* Will always email/message to let you know I have sent or received. 
* Lots of interesting trinkets, postcards, photos and small suprises ( I attempt to cram as much in the envelopes as possible!)
* A custom-CD every few letters with what I currently listen to. 
* I will be completely honest with you and will not hide any of my flaws.

What I expect from you:

* Reasonably long letters (not several-thousand but not something super short)
* Commitment and Effort into producing something lovely (I don't mind if it's not quite as bulky as mine as long as it isn't rushed)
* Emails / messages to let me know when you've sent and received. I don't expect super-swift replies but as long as you let me know if there will be a major delay.
* A long lasting correspondance.
 
I know this seems way more formal than most posts on here but because of the amount of effort I've put into producing letters in the past, I wanted to make my final attempt at making a close Penpal slightly different to explain exactly what you're signing up for! My letters are much less formal than this; I promise!

The last thing I should mention is that I type my letters. I have a severe case of Hyper-Mobility syndrome in my hands which prevents me from writing by hand at all.

Wow! The response for this idea was great! I can't believe it. We have a total of 48 people on board so far. This is going to be great.

I've been thinking the past couple of days of how to work this. This is were feedback and discussion will help. Being that there are so many of us, I don't think it's nessisary to make a full list to include in the letter. If we make a list here whoever has the letter at the time can see who's next in line and then get in touch with them. This will also help alleviate the posibility of someone changing addresses. When you think about it this is close to a year long project; lots can change in that time frame.

As far as the order goes, I was also thinking it would be neat to make this letter one of the most travelled letters ever. This could be done by sending the letter to the next person who's the farthest away. If we all put our countries and cities down before we start it would be a matter of organizing the list in such an order.

Thoughts?

A little about me: I have lived in the same area my entire life and I have dreams of busting out of here one day. I am an avid reader of just about most types of books. I have a kindle, but prefer the smell and weight of an actual book. I love to bake and cook. I love all sorts of music.

I live in the Salt Lake area, so for the sake of convenience for all parties, you should live between South Temple and 123000 South (or so), or visit the valley on a regular basis. 

I propose that we write letters and take them places for the other to pick up. This can be a business, a park with an interesting bench, or a tree with a particularly nice knothole. Really, anywhere you can dream up would work. We will write letters, and perhaps leave trinkets or something since there will be no postage necessary. We will PM with location and any special instructions, and leave the rest for the letters. 

My family has put together several scavenger hunt games, and leaving the clues in various places for lots of people in a rush (sometimes with weird instructions) to pick up has never been a problem, which is why I do not hesitate on this suggestion.

I just finished making him a card, and it got me to thinking about making them for others.  

So, for anyone who is interested, I would like to make a handmade card for you with a friendly message inside. (I'm particularly good at pop-up cards.)  Everyone likes having something special in the mail, and this is probably the easiest way to get one without commitment if you think you can't commit to a pen pal.  I'll send you a card, and in return I just ask for something you've made (a drawn picture, a letter, a card, etc.).  That's it; a simple one to one exchange.  

If you're interested then reply below with a little bit about yourself and some of your interests.  I'll make you a card and PM you to ask for your address.  Happy writing everyone.  :)

**Edit**: I'm making a list of people who asked for cards, the date their cards will be put in the mail, and pictures of the finished product for anyone who wants to see them.  It makes it easier to keep track because I've been getting some PMs too.  This offer is open to anyone who wants a card, so don't feel shy to ask.  I have plenty of crafting supplies and the time to do it.  :)

.

Many years ago, on the beginnings of a summer train ride through the Alps, a friend pulled a slender wooden box from her travel pack. It was heavy in my hands, polished from some dark majestic tree the world no longer has enough of and finished with a sterling finger clasp. My name had been pyrographed into the top and I remember tracing my fingers from the first letter into the last before peering inside.

.

""Picked out a name for him already?"" she said, laughing at my excitement as I carefully lifted the silver-barrelled fountain pen away from its violet silk bed.

.

At the time, the thought of naming a pen had just been her way of teasing my love for all things old fashioned. But later, as I sat on that train, listening to the click-clack of the rails as we skated past mountain after mountain, watching this pen dance across page after page, I discovered a personality between my fingertips. A personality with impatient wisdom and the young ability to paint emotion onto a greyscale canvas. A personality deserving of a name.

.

In hours turned to minutes, the pen and I turned a short leaf of cheap stationary into poems and sketches, love letters and short stories. Some pages contained the alphabet and lists of new-found favourite words, others were a playground of signatures, markedly improving down the paper as the pen said ""no, do it this way"" with increasing earnest.

.

Out of paper and unwilling to wake my friend from her much needed rest, I sought out the train steward to ask him for help. After a long search, the man returned with a giant smile and a sheaf of used stockroom logs awaiting recycle. I wrote half of my first novel on those pages, not even stopping for lunch as the train rolled through Austria and into Italy. Soon after crossing the border, my friend woke up, stretching through a smile as she watched my hands help the pen fill his reservoir from its nearly empty starter bottle.

.

""What are these?"" she said, picking up the pages from the novel I'd turned upside down on a chair. I explained the train steward's gift as she leafed through the repeating checklists of pantry items and luggage procedures, only noticing our additions to the back of each page after reaching the stack's end.

.

Despite my pleas of ""it's not finished"", she began reading. Bouncing my foot on the carpet and his cap on the chair arm, the pen and I watched her flip page after page, stopping every so often to laugh or to ask for a word where the pen and I had fought over how to write the letter ""G"". Or to wipe away soggy eyes and kiss me. Her reaction was not a testament to the writing's quality but perhaps a reaction to the writing having been written for her, to her, with her.

.

She had not finished when the train steward came by to announce our arrival into Verona. During our conversation, he might of commented on the other pages full of signatures or I might of finally glanced at what a train's pantry log contained, I don't remember. But for some reason or other I noticed his signature on the bottom of almost every paper just in time to thank Frederick by name. The man nodded with a grin before moving on to ready the other passengers.

.

My friend and I spent the next summer months travelling through Italy, the Middle East, and southern Spain before temporarily separating so I could manage home life in Canada and her the same in the UK. She was killed in a motor accident not two weeks after our respective flights.

.

Our relationship began in spring on a train ride to London, grew through a month's letters between France and Sweden, and turned diamond-strong on the quiet beaches of Spain. But I miss her for different reasons now, having pushed through the grief to find a writing career, a university degree, and a woman I love as fiercely as she does me.

.

I've had many fountain pens since Frederick, all with names. There was a fiery Japanese model named Monica I wrote a ranting column with, a leaky old fart of a pen named Alfred that specialised in short poetry, and I carry a half dozen disposable buddies all named Pip to give to friends not yet introduced to the society of fountain ink.

.

Frederick and I never finished the first novel, but over the years I have discovered his true passion: letter writing. He travels in my breast pocket, knows my signature by heart, satisfied with the task of scribbling lecture notes, but we both miss the patience and care afforded by letter craft. 

.

If you've a passion for the English language and telling stories from your life, consider responding to my request for a penpal. Ideally you would be willing to write 2-3 letters a month and are not turned off by reading and writing correspondence of this length. No expectations on what we would talk about, but topics like writing, past or desired travel, and philosophy from experience come to mind. We can swap stories; between travel, a frustrating-but-often-fantastic/hilarious sleep disorder, and a proclivity for trouble and risk, I've plenty to share. Really, anything you like!

I do now wish to receive a letter back, but let me put words on paper in hopes of making something beautiful for you. Are you going through hard times? Do you feel the need to hear words of encouragement that you could keep a while with you?  
&gt;
&gt;I’m neither poet nor writer, nor do I write eloquently. Yet I’m willing to try to brighten up your day. The length of the letters may vary; you could receive a letter that’s only couple of paragraphs long, then again you might find yourself reading a mini novel. The topics of letters will also vary.
&gt;
&gt;If you feel that you are in need of a friendly letter then please respond below. Tell me little about yourself via pm or by commenting; if you feel then you can also disclose what’s bothering you. 
&gt;
&gt;Please, take care of yourself.
&gt;
P.S. As it’s going to be an international mail, there will be a slight prolonged wait for you to receive a letter for me. 

&gt;**EDIT:****Sorry for the slow responses you have been receiving from me so far. Everyone who has so far posted a comment or sent me a PM will get a letter.**



**EDIT**:For the sake of structure I posted a schedule up here for you to see and to know when you’re next in line. As I won’t be relieving those people’s usernames who only responded via PM then I named them with the term “anonymous” in my list. If I forgot to tell someone his/her number in the list then send me a PM and I’ll correct my mistake.

^1 *It will be the first and only preview I'm going to upload. I just wanted to show why writing these letters might take longer. All of the smaller envelopes contain a message of their own. Plus the other side of the envelope is  illustrated as well. But I will leave that to the receiver to see. Anyway, every envelope will contain something else beside a letter. What that is, is for you to find out.*

I was recently blown away by the generosity of the people of Reddit when I put out a call for birthday cards for my fiance on a few subreddits ... and the number of people who immediately put their hands up and were happy to help was amazing (and it made her cry - in a good way - that so many people she never met would take the time to wish her a happy birthday)

The reaction to both of these : My post on /r/PenPals and My post on /r/RandomKindness was beyond what I could have dreamed ...

But now I come to the hard bit .... Recently one of my good friends found out that his brother has cancer of the liver and has spread to three different parts of his spine. One of his vertebrae collapsed due to this and now on top of it all he has a fractured spine.

All his life my friend has devoted his time to being there for his brother as he has been in and out of hospital since he was born with ongoing heart issues.

My friend Doug explains the situation much better than me ... http://youtu.be/gZbgdh9iTOQ

and if you do feel like donating something the website is http://www.mycause.com.au/page/friendinneed

I am asking if people can send ""Thinking of You"" or ""Get Well"" cards ... that kind of thing ... something to surprise them with ... something to make his family smile ....

Please send all cards to Joong Cho c/o

Post Office Box 2132 Kardinya Western Australia 6163

Thanks in advance for your generosity.

My preferred method of correspondence is snail mail.  If you rush to the mailbox in anticipation of seeing a handwritten letter, penned with ink and sealed with wax, then you're in for a pleasant surprise. 

I do not have any preference as to age or gender, but prefer to correspond with individuals who are proficient in English and use correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar; creativity and humor a bonus.

My name is Grant David Anderson II. I am a writer, musician, artist, chef, poet, and most recently a candy maker.  I'm well read, and ""well-listened"" (if that's a thing).  I pride myself on being able to converse on any subject. I'll be happy to reply to any topic of discussion or simply talk about day to day life. Rest assured, any personal information, problems, or other revelations of a personal or intimate nature will be treated with the utmost respect; I shall do my best to pen some considerate advice that doesn't condescend or indoctrinate.

If you are unsure on what to write, the topic of ""time travel"" is a good place to start, as I am currently in the process of finishing three novels that feature it prominently.  I am always interested in hearing where people would go or what they would do with a time machine, especially if it differs from the usual.  

I will, to the best of my ability, try to write a response to each and every letter received.

Please PM or comment your interest and I'll send you my address straight away. 

I look forward to hearing from you,

I'm 20 and female and I'm from Colorado/US. I'll tell you my name later if you decide to message me. 

* I'm currently a sophomore in college going for an Associates of Applied Science in Cosmetology. So yes, I'm going to college for hair, nails, and skin. I graduate next Spring. I'm currently an honors student with a 3.7 GPA and yes I have had to take English, Math, Science and Humanities classes for my degree. After I graduate I actually plan on working somewhere like a convenience store for awhile before pursuing my career.  For my career I would love to work in theater doing hair and makeup, specifically fancy fantasy and scifi stuff and I would love to do nails on the side. Two dreams of mine are either being able to work on Broadway or opening up an 'alternative' fashion boutique and maybe offering some salon services there. 

* I live at home with my mom and my dad. I have one older brother who is married and has a 2 year old son. They live on the East Coast. I have other family, quite a large family actually, but we don't talk to most of them. I get along with the family members I have mentioned and I love them dearly. I only really have a couple of close friends in real life and I dont really get to hang out with them often because of work/school/kids etc. 

* So here's some other shit now. 
I love music and I basically listen to just about everything or I will at least listen to it once and decide if I like it or not. I've grown out of the whole bashing music thing but there are still some things that I cannot stand. I do mostly listen to rock and the bazillion subgenres within. 

* I am a damn movie buff. I have see well over 300 movies in my life and there are so many more that I need and want to see. I watch b/w classics on TCM, modern blockbusters, and indy films. I love horror movies even though I am a damn scaredy cat. I haven't see as many as I would like, but I've still seen quite a few. I also love Tim Burton, Disney, Hayao Miyazaki and so many others. 

* I read a lot, or I try to when I have the time. Lately I haven't been in a reading mood, which I will elaborate on later. But I love fantasy, scifi, and romance and usually I read books that have all three. I currently own over 30 books and most of them I still need to read. Hopefully I'll have time when I'm done with my summer semester. 

* And of course TV. I watch a lot of stuff on Science, Discovery, TLC, History, National Geographic, I basically love learning about stuff. I LOVE paranormal shows, but the only ghost hunting show I watch is Ghosthunters. Other shows I watch are The Walking Dead, Family Guy, American Dad, The Legend of Korra, Grimm, Swamp People, Axe Men, Deadliest Catch, Top Gear, Top Shot, Total Blackout, Say Yes To The Dress, and probably a few others. 
I love art and tattoos and piercings. I love vintage things as well. Most anything Japanese I like. I'm also really into Gothic everything pretty much but I won't call myself Gothic because I will get yelled at for a variety of reasons. I love animals and have both cats and dogs. I like to collect things, draw, scrapbook, take photos, blog and all that good stuff. 

* And something else you should know about me. 
I'm lonely and alone. I suffer from depression and I am medicated for it, but it doesn't always help. I have horrible self esteem, I am completely insecure and I lack confidence the majority of the time. I do not find myself to be interesting, intelligent, funny, attractive..anything. I feel worthless quite often and yes, I've had suicidal thoughts before. I had GoneWild and GoneWildPlus posts, but I took them down because I feel like they weren't doing any good, probably more so damaging. 
But I care about others...a lot. I listen and learn and try to be there and help as much as I can. But sometimes I can't. Sometimes its too much for me and I get sad that I cant be a better friend. 

* So this is me. If you're still here and somehow still interested let me know. I love talking to people. I'd like to start with either talking here or through email/IM before moving to texting or something because I feel like you cant really get to know someone a lot through texting.

The span and coverage between these letters could be months and we wrote lots of trivial stuff... almost like writing a diary for the other person to read. Those were my favourite kind of letters; no bullshit or pretentious world saving and no pressure about having super intelligent content.

So that's what I'm looking for now. Penpals around the world that might share the same interests with me and are curious to hear about a normal, even boring, life. There should be no pressure to answer the letters as fast as possible, but instead you're free to take your time and maybe write a bit on several days, perhapsh diary like, and once you feel the letter might be getting too lenghty, send it.

I'd prefer to find penpals around my own age and similar interests, but I'm not limiting it to that. If you'd like to be my penpal, send me a PM and tell me a little bit about yourself. :)

I'm not 'a writer' or even much of a storyteller, but I like to observe and to think. In fact, I sort of just hang out with myself in my own head all the time. It's pretty cool in here. Great conversation, nice acoustics...but it gets a little lonely. Anyways, just today, I thought to myself, ""Hey. I should share what I have to say with other people. I should start writing!"" And I replied, ""Hell yeah, man! That's an f-ing great idea. All you've gotta do is just get off your ass and actually do something for once."" Good point, self-aware other-me.

Right. So, I've decided to start a project to get myself in gear, and I figured out a way for you guys to keep me on track and maybe get something awesome out of it too. Starting now, I would like to work on a different piece of writing every week: a short story, essay, poem, whatever. This piece of writing will be based on a word or theme suggested by one of you guys. When I am done, I will send the person who gave me the theme a handwritten copy of my work in the mail all pretty and old-fashioned-like for you to keep! In exchange, I ask just one thing: send me a reply! It can be anything from your thoughts, suggestions, critiques, or even just a couple bullets of likes and dislikes. Your brutal honesty is humbly requested. 

I don't care how many people sign up for this. I promise to write every single one of these stories. It might sound crazy, but I'm tired of feeling like I'm not doing what I want to be doing with my life. I want to accomplish something I'm proud of, even if it's just a few crappy pages of strung-together nonsense. I want to be a finisher. Please, help me out and be the final push and inspiration I need!

Here's a more well-organized version of how I'm imagining this will work out:

**Step 1:** You think to yourself, ""This sounds like a cool idea! I want to sign up for this!""

**Step 2:** Comment with a word or phrase you want me to write about.

**Step 3:** I gather all the comments and people and arrange them into a to-do list with a different person every week.

**Step 4:** When I get to your suggestion (which may be a few weeks down the line), I will PM/email you (whichever you please) and let you know that it is your week and that I will hopefully be mailing something out to you by the end of said week.

**Step 5:** Pester me. PM me things like ""Hey, how's that story coming along. ;)"" Be aggressive! 

**Step 6:** Receive letter from me. Read it while relaxing in your favorite armchair, feet up and settled down. Or standing right in front of your mailbox where your neighbors can gawk at you. Whatever floats your boat. (Weirdo.)

**Step 7:** Write a response to me and send it my way (snail mail or virtually, at your pleasure). 

**Step 8:** Bask in my radiant gratitude!

I'm open to suggestions on how to facilitate/improve this process. Thanks for reading all of this, and I hope you consider helping me out! :)

Also, in case this might entice any of you, [this is a sample](http://i.imgur.com/JCD0ztj.jpg) of my handwriting (except marginally neater)

EDIT:
Thanks for all the interest, guys! Here's what the list looks like so far:

Week 1: Selectedstudy - ""Make new friends, but keep the old; one is silver but the others gold.""

Week 2: mepena2 - a story inspired by Edgar Allen Poe

Week 3: tourmalinetangent - people falling in love over handwriting

Week 4: notimemaketime - waiting

Week 5: evilgrapher - llamas (I predict that I'll be spending a lot of time on tumblr/youtube/wikipedia for this one, haha)

Week 6: sophieneveu - love and finding friendship

Week 7: turtleslikekiwi - Childhood imagination

Week 8: rocklogic101 - solitude/loneliness

Week 9: viggiesauce - giraffes!

Week 10: Warnocerous - Old fashioned clam bake (This might involve some delicious, real life research)

Week 11: Kat0nine - ""Don't blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast. Faster than you can believe. Don't turn your back. Don't look away. And don't blink. Good Luck.""

Week 12: AMcc20 - Everything alters.

Projected end date: week ending on June 1, 2013

Alright, if anybody else comments, I'll add them to the list, but I'm going to go ahead and get started on Selectedstudy's topic. If I get writer's block, I might switch the order up a bit, but I'll try my best to stick to this. Thank you all for the wonderful ideas! :)

Lately, I enjoy more and more writing longer e-mails, and if that's what you're into too, then I think we got a match. 

So, I'm male, I'm French - living near Paris - and I'm 35. Don't let that deter you, though, I'm still the same idiot I was 15 years ago. With just a few more responsibilities. 

I'm not really looking for people who share the exact same tastes as mine. I'm more looking forward to hear about what *YOU* cherish and what you regret. What you're looking forward to and where you expect to be on the same day next year. I'm also interested to know what life's like in your area and what you had for breakfast yesterday morning. And above all: what do you make of it all. I'll try to do the same, although my breakfasts are maybe a bit too boring to warrant long discussions.

Still, a penpal post here wouldn't be a penpal post if I didn't mention that lately, I've been enjoying running, listening to old Gilles Peterson mixes, and browsing dx.com for the most ridiculous stuff. Thankfully, I'm getting much less nerdy as time goes by. I've also resumed my quest to watch every movie in the IMDB Top 250.

I'm fluent in English, but if practicing your French is what rocks your boat, we can probablement échanger un peu en Français aussi. The way we do it with one of my other penpals is that we switch language every other paragraph,. That works pretty well actually. 

I prefer e-mail, but I’m not against the occasional snail-mail/postcard/snack-exchange. I'd really just prefer people who are feeling serious about getting a penpal. As they say, a penpal is not just for Christmas.

Once I have created the mailing list, I'll post it with just the usernames and let everyone check over it to make sure I haven't missed over you. After that's been up for a day I'll send out the lil alien to the first recipient and wait for the pictures to start flowing in! Any questions/ideas please please please pm me this is just something I came up with bored at work and would love to hear your input. Thanks for doing this I've wanted something like this for a long time and can't wait to see everyones' pictures!!

EDIT: Ok already changing some things, thanks to ArchaiosFiniks idea, we are going to simply take everyone's username onto a list, include that with the alien and once you have taken your pictures, simply PM the next person on the list asking for their address and then keep him moving around the world!

I am not certain if this is the proper place to post this; let me know, mods! 

Originally, I had created this account for the purpose of finding a few friends with whom I could regularly correspond. After a few days of peeking into subreddits and poking around, I realized that a lot of us are looking for something, or someone, to connect to. Posting anonymously and the subsequent “I feel for ya, man” or “internet hugs” are pleasant but, sometimes, don’t quite fill the void in our hearts. I realize that many of us Redditors, myself included, are SAPs or, otherwise, socially-inept and often don’t have the support network that socially awesome penguins have. All too often, I hear stories where people kill themselves because they felt that they had no one to turn to and that makes a tragic story all the more heart-breaking. So, I’d like to offer a proverbial shoulder, to cry with you, to laugh with you, to share in both your victories and your setbacks. No need to give me your name or e-mail, use a throwaway, if it makes you more comfortable but, if there’s something you’d like to talk about or need to get off your chest, please, send me a PM : )

Also, please feel free to send me a message, even if you don’t have anything in particular to talk about; we can still be friends! : )

(A long time ago, I told myself ""Kat, teaching is hard. It's going to suck a lot of the time. But your goal is going to be to get one student a year (or every other year, if you have to) to tell you 'I didn't like English before I took your class'. Failing that, your goal can be 'find something to love about all of your students'. Failing that, your goal can be 'find a job that does not involve hamburgers'.) 

I like a lot of things that, despite their massive popularity in mainstream culture, are still deemed ""nerdy"": Doctor Who, Harry Potter, books, art, poetry, The Avengers (though plenty of people would probably call me that annoying fan who's only ever seen the film), and stuff like that. (Ever notice how, when you try to make a list of things that interest you, your brain shuts down and can only deal in generalizations?)

I'm a once-lapsed but currently-renewed Pagan, so if you're a Pagan too, that'd be cool. Or if you're an atheist or Catholic or Hindu or really anything. I just thought I'd put that out there in case it was a problem. I also consider myself a nerdfighter of sorts: I don't participate in that community very often, but our ideals align in many ways, so there's that. 

Finally I'm very careful about my language. I do not call people ""retards"" or ""fags"" and I will not tolerate that sort of language in my friends--even my pen-pal friends. If that bothers you, you are entitled to your own opinion, but I do not think we'll get along. 

I'm not a fan of email correspondence. I think my generation is kind of a tough one: we grew up with computers, so the internet is a common thing, but we also grew up in the tail end of the era of letters, just before email got  big. Email is too easy for me, too impersonal and fast. I like the anticipation of a letter, the satisfying ripping sound that envelopes make as you tear into them, the tantalizing feel of a thick stack of folded sheets of paper just waiting to be read.

Below is some of the text from my original post:

""My best friend of 15 years was recently incarcerated. I’d rather not give too many details on here other than it was for a non-violent offense. He’s very protective of his privacy, and that of his friends and family. So by choice, and luck, very few people who know him know of his situation and he has very limited contact with people on the outside. He’s a great guy in his upper twenties who just got involved in something stupid, acknowledges his mistake, but will now be gone for quite a while. He’s remained in good spirits about his ordeal, and we joke a lot back and forth about it. He’s a gamer and a huge movie buff, two things that he’s been separated from but still loves to talk about. He loves writing and already has a lot of great stories from inside. He says every mail call is a bit like Christmas morning, and everyone just hopes to hear their name called. I’d love to make this happen more often for him.""

Anyway, I suck because I lack creativity and it's almost her birthday and I just got this idea. I'd be so very grateful if you guys want to help me out.

She's the type of girl that believes she can cure the world with love. I've never seen anyone who helps others like she does, never seen someone who put so much effort into things other people just pass by. She does a lot of charity work even though she is ill and her body sometimes wont let her. She truely is an amazing person.

But she gets forgotten. People tend to think its normal to have such a kind, generous person in their life. She is going through a very, very difficult time now and I see her slipping away. All the effort she puts in the world doesnt neem to get back at her.

Please, please Reddit, will you do this for me? I don't care what you send. PM me for her hobbies/interests if you'd like or just choose a cool card. She lives in Europe, btw.

**Like the title says, I'm 17 (turning 18 in a week!), female, and from a rather small town in Virginia.**

I'm looking for someone who wants to **share secrets and inner thoughts**, though if you don't, don't take yourself out of the running! I would love to find someone, or some people, who want to **trade doodles, snippets of writing, books... whatever!** in addition to letters. I'd love to hear about your day-to-day life, wherever you're from!

I can kind of **speak French** but it's been a while since I've had any practice.

**Interests, you ask?**

I love reading, my favorite author is **Kurt Vonnegut** (I'll send you copies of his books since I have a million) but I'm also a sucker for Hemingway and Shirley Jackson. 

I got through high school by analyzing literature (need Shakespeare help?) and doing AP Physics practice problems. 

I graduated early from high school so I've been out of high school for a year- thank GAWD. I was a Virginia Tech but now I'm going to my local community college. 

I'm planning on transferring, hopefully to University of Chicago or UC Berkeley. **I want nothing more than to do research and travel for the rest of my life.**

I love music. I play **trumpet, euphonium, piano, and now banjo** as well as composing (not very well). My favorite bands are all over the place but I truly love **the Pixies and Leonard Cohen. And Acid Mothers Temple.** Pretty much, ask me a genre and I'll tell you who or what I like. 

And back to art... I really enjoy drawing though I'm not particularly skilled. I can send you some pictures of my more recent work if you want, just send me a PM! 

I'm also working on creative writing so if you want papers covered in lines that aren't quite write or napkins with a couple of words on it, I'm your girl!

I like science-fiction a lot! I'm a massive **Doctor Who fan** (I love the old stuff and the new) and might fan girl out on you. I also love Star Wars and I'm recently getting into Star Trek. 

I'll send a letter to anyone who wants one and we'll see how it goes from there! **I don't care how old or young you are** but I should warn you that I've been told **I have the soul of a sixty-year-old man.** Jewish too but I'm not sure where that came from. Really, I'm open to writing to anyone but tell me a bit about you so I have something to go from.

If you want, I'm up for texting too. I've kind of picked up a speech impediment (not seriously, I just can't make my speech work) lately and it probably won't go away for a while so I'm not too comfortable with calls or Skype.

Hopefully I've told you enough so you can decide if you want to talk or not. There's a lot more to me than just this!

**TL;DR** Just check what's bolded. Although, if you're too lazy to read this much my letters might be too long. :D

Hey there, I've been here before, but I lost contact with my penpals, all my fault. I was going through some bad stuff and writing everyday became too stressful and impersonal by e-mail.

I'd like to read handwritten letters, coffee and blot stained pages of your life. I'm living alone for the first time in a city I don't fully know and I kinda feel, well, lonely.

I like stories, if you need to get something out of your chest, landscapes, animals, weird facts, cultural differences, languages, doodles and/or drawings, pictures, if you'd like to recommend a book, anything really, I just want read something from someone real. 

One more thing, I keep repeating this but it's only because I don't like surprises or making anyone uncomfortable, I'm gay. Just putting it out there so it's not an issue, also because I'd like to build a friendship so if we're ever to meet we can have a beer and it won't be awkward.

Let's exchange emails. This may be upgraded to snail-mail later, provided you are not a strange and suspicious individual who is likely to send me live kittens with my name and address printed on them in magic marker. Note that I am very much a strange and suspicious individual myself, but I have the good sense to wrap the hungry boa constricto - err, ""kitten"" in proper packaging first. 

As you can tell from my ever-intriguing post title, I speak a bunch of languages. (Poorly.) Please feel free to write to me in any language that I sort of speak, or even one that I don't. I have a thing for umlauts. If your language doesn't have any, throw some in anyway. Just because.

My topics of expertise include: video games, procrastination, borsht (Russian beet soup), boa constrictors, LEGOs, miscellaneous tech support stuff and for some reason, art history.

I don't have any age, gender, or country preferences for my penpals. 
Write to me about anything you want. If you don't feel like writing, send me pictures of something interesting. 

That's all!

Looking forward to your letters,

Lakemonsters

EDIT: Thanks everyone for writing and especially to those who kindly sent me umlauts. I am amazed at how diverse the Reddit community is: I got letters from the US (both of you are from California), Spain, Chile, India, Africa, Finland, Turkmenistan, New Zealand and others (apologies if I missed your country.) I will respond to everyone eventually, even though I won't be able to send letters to all of you on a regular basis. (I totally would if I had the time!)

Thanks again guys, you are all amazing.

I'm a 17 year old high-schooler from Finland, and I'd love to send and recieve letters. I'm new to this kind of stuff so I'm not sure what to put here but I guess I'll just describe myself or something.

I'm an extremely extroverted person. What that means is not that I'm an overtly obnoxious idiot who talks about bullshit, it means that my mind is mostly ""out there"" instead of ""inside."" I rarely just sit and stare at nothing while thinking of something deep. I constantly observe my environment. People, nature and that kind of stuff. I like to share a lot about my life and opinions with people, but I also **love** listening to people.

I talk Finnish, English and a little bit of Swedish and German.

I'm a movie-geek! I watch movies almost every day. Classics, new films, hipster-y underground films, everything! I love Kubrick, Coen brothers, Nolan, you know the cliché movie geek's favourites. Favourite movie has to be Dr. Strangelove. I've seen it over ten times and I could talk about it for days!

I listen to a *lot* of music. And I listen to everything. House, rock 'n roll (50's-70's), psybient, punk, some rap, some country, some jazz, blues...

Sadly I can't enjoy reading a book. I **can't** concentrate on reading a book. I've read the Hobbit but that took a month of about ten-twenty minute-sprees of reading. So sorry. Maybe you could help me with this?

I love traveling. My biggest dream, which I've been planning for almost two years already, is to walk from the Alaskan Peninsula to Tierra del Fuego (tip of South America) I'll either die when doing this or die after doing this. No other options in which I don't die in a sudden freak accident. I'm a pretty outgoing guy, I cycle, go to the gym, swim in a nearby lake and so on. I love the nature and am a bit of a hippie.

Sometimes I dance with Lady Lucy, sometimes with Mary Jane.

I also like doodling and drawing portraits!

I'd like to share anything and everything with my penpal. Secrets, recipies, movies, music, doodles, whatever! Whatever you want to share go ahead and share.

My humour is a bit dark and/or dry. If you know Finnish humour you know my humour.

I am a master muffin baker from the year 1876. I suppose by way of comparison I am but 23. You see, one evening I was crafting the perfect muffin in my laboratory. The thing about muffins are that the oven plays such a huge role in the final texture. The quicker they bake, the less dry they are. So I developed a newfangled oven that cooks them instantly. I didn't understand how it worked at first, I was just messing around with some spare parts I got from the local smith and my friend at the factory.


That is, until one day I accidently bumped into the oven and it stopped working properly. At first, muffins would just *disappear *after a minute or so in the oven, and *reappear *a few moments later. Eventually they began appearing days, then weeks later. A truly curious contraption, and I was uncertain of what to make of it all. I just wanted to fix the oven to get along with my muffin shop, but fate had different plans for me. One evening, my local competitor, Burnaby Entenmann, broke into my laboratory late at night. He struck me over the head and stuffed me in my own oven. He tried to kill me, but as it seems I was transported into the future instead.


I crawled out of the very same oven, and to my surprise, it was in the basement of a strange building. Since then, I have bee trying to tweak the oven to bring be back to the past and seek revenge. It has been a lot of work, and in the meanwhile I'd like to try out some written correspondence to pass the time.

""The idea would be to e-mail/send a letter to each other anonymously maybe once a week/fortnight. The catch will be that the e-mails/letters you send will be your own, completely inharmonious with one another. Therefore it wouldn't be so much a conversation between one another but more akin to reading someone's own life story.""
I'd like to know the everyday happenings of your life and what you're thinking/feeling and just to watch you grow or decline as a person. It would be mostly like you writing ""diary"" entries and then sending them to me and I would do the same for you.

I'd probably say that the only catch with this is that I am an adolescent female dealing with anxiety and major depression. With that said, I don't lead a very ""active"" lifestyle, but I do things and I'd like to think my life is sorta kinda interesting. An upside to my lack of activity is that I actually have down time to keep up with writing the entries and sending them to you about once a week or every other week. So, what do you say? :) Ideally I'd like to exchange snail mail with a male around the same age as me.. but I'm open to females as well.

**sidenote:** I think it would be really interesting to exchange entries with another person who might also be suffering from the same disabilities as I am (depression/anxiety) as I'd like to hear about your experiences living with it.. and it might be a little easier for you to read mine since you can relate.

I want to liven up my life a little, and not let my fears get in the way of that.

I want you to do this with me.

Are you like me? Ever look at something and go ""Wow that sounds amazing but it's not something I think I could ever do?"" LET'S STOP DOING THIS WITH EACH OTHER.

I want to make a list of all the things I see that I think sound fun but I'm too nervous, anxious, scared, or insecure to try, and I want you to do the same. I want to mail these lists to each other, and then I want us to start doing the things on these lists, sending pictures to each other as we accomplish them. You don't have to do them by yourself: bring a friend! A family member! Let's not set out on this venture by ourselves!

It can be big things like bungee jumping or white water rafting, or small things like leaving a note in a library book, going out to dinner by yourself, or finally making use of the photo booth at your mall. The list can be long or short, and yeah there probably will be things that neither of us accomplish -- that's totally fine. No shame! We're not superheros, you guys. Just people working to broaden their worldviews a little. And we only try them at our own pace; I'm not going to say you MUST try something at least once a week or even once a month... that's not fair.

We can write each other about our fears, about the exhilaration or the stomach-sickening anxiety that we got when we tried these things. We can be proud of each other, encourage each other, and just listen to each other ramble about what we did. I will never judge you for backing out of an attempt, and never judge you for what you want to do. I expect the same level of respect! You can do these scary things, knowing that even if you embarrass yourself in front of people, you can always come back to me and I will not like you any less.

So, yes. A very specific request. I don't know if anyone had the patience to read all of that, and if anyone is even interested in such a thing. I hope at least one of you will step out of your comfort zone with me! Age, gender, location, it doesn't matter here. We're all equally capable of being socially awkward and we're also all capable of overcoming this (I hope! haha).

baseball (and other sports too). Cards are my favorite. 

music (I like blues and swing the best but I honestly like a lot of different things) Fun fact, I can play the piano.

Films/movies. My favorite Comedy might just be Clifford (Not the big red dog, asshole). My favorite drama is To Catch A Thief (love me some Cary Grant). I love older films and idgaf what you say, Bob Hope is funny as fuck. I also love newer movies as well, obviously. I don't live in a fucking cave.

Food. because I'm human.

Psychology. (it's my major. Junior in college) 

Art. I paint and draw. Not professionally or particularly well, but it's something I enjoy and people tell me I'm decent. 

okay, I really can't think of anything else for that...so here's some characteristics that are love or hate for most people, but I happen to love. just so you know:

I like sarcasm

Reference humor

humor in general

cheesy/corny jokes

Lighthearted banter

the ability to be serious when need be

23/F/US chick here. I just moved to my new apartment in Charleston a few days ago! So I'm still fairly new to the area and I would love to have penpals!

The biggest reason I wanted to have penpals (besides the exchanging of awesome stationary and doodles pictures in the corners) is one of my interests is to travel and there are plenty of places I want to visit (and revisit) overseas and in the US. So my ultimate goal is to make friends through penpals from all different locations and hopefully come to visit my penpals in the future and vice versa.

I used to live in Japan so I have a bunch of crazy girly stationary. However, I also have non-man threatening man stationary as well I could use. I love to doodle so you might get a picture or two from me :)! I also craft a bit so once I get my sewing station in order, I might make you a few things like a ballroom gown or a upholstery set for your couch. I do not discriminate on gender or location, but I'd prefer to have a penpal that's 21 and over.

A little about me: I work for an indie studios as a marketing assistant. I too hate the cold weather. I enjoy being active. I do roller derby, kickball, and flag football on occasion to keep fit.

I also like things like going to exhibits, seeing shows, and discovering new things about people.

Okay, so what I'm looking for in a penpal is: you could either be male or female (I don't care). And basically that's it. I'm cool with talking about anything anyway.

Alright, let me explain that title.
First of all, as you people can read, I'm French. I was born and raised in France, though both my parents are from a different country. As many people who share multiple cultural roots, I've grown up with a slight distance to my adoptive country's culture and am pretty sure that gives me the ability today to act as some kind of bridge between French culture and other ones, and that is something I would like to share with anyone who would be interested in ""discussing"" France without facing too much unconstructive chauvinism. 
Also, I have a pretty deep knowledge of the French language, and would love to simply help anyone who's looking to get better at it (I'll gladly correct all your mistakes, so, fire away!)
Ok, so that was the first point.
The second one is, for some reason, I've been feeling the need lately, to discuss some important matters with people who don't share my culture. I've been recently sensing that my life history, where I grew up, who I met, everything which makes me ""me"" in general, act as restrictions about how I see things (seems obvious, right?). However, today, I feel like I need to try and understand how things look through a different prism than my own, and I'd be glad if you could help me, you, anyone from a far away place. Obviously, and as most of you, I have many interests, but exchanging about the TV shows I like or the music I listen to is not what I'm looking for right now. If you feel like skipping the small-talk, and getting to the real stuff right now, then let's just go.

Disclaimer : I'm extremely tired from work and slightly drunk, so I'm not sure whether anything that I wrote makes real sense, or if it's some kind of pseudo-intellectual jibberish. So, my apologies to those who read to the end, yet feel like they lost their time doing so. Peace, Reddit!

And although world domination through postcards may sound weird, I gotta start somewhere! ;)
So, if you would like a lovely Chicago postcard (or a cool and funky one), send me one from your state or country! ;D

I would love to here from you!! (and perhaps about you, your town, or just something cool!!) By the way; age, sex, gender, religion, sexual orientation; it doesn't matter!! The only thing that matters is YOU!! :D

Either I'm gonna look awesome when I'm older or I behave like a three year old.

Anywho, I'm a mathematician by trade, now working on my PhD in history of mathematics, or in other words, I'm pedantic and anal in some things and fancyshmancy and highbrow in others. But I can also be quite chaotic and happy-go-lucky, yeeha. I'm very fond of my Xbox and my machines running Linux even if I don't always understand what I'm doing; I like action movies, podcasts, and baking bread, and I enjoy taking pictures, reading out loud, and being silly. The man of my dreams has a nicely kept beard/stubble and looks absolutely dashing in a suit, chip chip cheerio. Brownie points for sideburns!

I've also been burned a couple times, or maybe I have burned myself, who knows. I have my anxieties and I do my best to work with and around and against them, but it's difficult not to just give in to the void below at times. I've been on my own for awhile, despite having made a few friends, and I painfully miss having someone to confide in, someone I can trust to be there for me, but also someone I can take care of myself. Especially the past year has been quite difficult for me.

Well, I guess that's supposed to be me in a nutshell, then ;) If you're squirrely enough, drop me a line, and we'll see about further nutty mails.

I have been feeling a bit cut off from other people lately due to somethings going on in my life. I do use the computer quite a lot though and would love to have some people to talk to on a normal basis.

I have many experiences that I can share and have traveled to many places and seen many things. I find that usually it is hard for me to express myself so unless you ask a certain question you might find my answer not very satisfactory. 

I come from a very large family and spent much time taking care of my younger siblings and directing them.

I do believe my religion completely and faithfully if you dislike this please do not approach me, it will only lead to hatred rather than friendship between us. If you want to learn about Islam I will be happy to teach you but I am not the most devout person so my actions do not reflect actual Islam. 

I want to find good friends no matter where you are, I hope that maybe we can visit each other in other countries if we do find a good friendship

Many people find it hard to put up with me sometimes, during my childhood I learned to speak in a commanding voice and tone because I always told me younger siblings what to do. I have in my recent years found that when I get relaxed with people though, I tend to get a bit childish myself but not in a way that will harm anyone.  

I think this is enough for you to understand whether you want to become my friend or not.

Yes, I can be a little crazy. Anyway, on to my interests and passions. 

I am passionate about politics(the substantive problems of running a government more than the scheming), learning about stuff, and martial arts. I am interested in the sciences in general, pysch and other fields that relate to politics especially. Also philosophy, debate, reading, history, and a heck of a lot of other things. Basically, if it is considered to be intellectual, I probably like it.

I also enjoy watching good TV shows like Doctor who or Game of Thrones, or reading good books like a Game of Thrones or the LOTR, playing video games, and talking about more random stuff. 

People around my age would be nice, but I am also interested in the wisdom of the ancients - anyone over 20 falls into the latter category. Having someone wiser than I to guide me as I learn about the world, and especially about politics and philosophy would be awesome. You too can be a wise mentor figure who is killed a quarter of the way into the story. Especially poli-sci or international relations majors -or similiar fields. I am planning in majoring in one of those for college.

Or just peers to learn from each other and talk about stuff. Either gender is great.

I have had some great responses from people and managed to keep a select few penpals going. Some have fizzled out (as they are wont to do), and so I was looking at starting up some new correspondences where possible.

I have recently started work for social services, so could benefit from the escapism of writing to someone new, away from the stresses and strains of 'real' life.

Currently, I am trying to perfect the perfect pizza, enjoying tabletop/board gaming, sampling a variety of teas from around the world, and working my way through the huge selection of TED talks there are.

last gig was '[calexico](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3l1yAbwaSM)' (but looking forward to seeing 'chvches' soon), last film I watched was '[love](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1541874/?ref_=fn_al_tt_2)', and currently reading '[the brothers Karamazov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Brothers_Karamazov)'. I'm always open to reccommendations about new things, and love it when people get passionate about their interests, even if they differ to my own.

Email is nice to start with, but would be looking at snail mail eventually and, needless to say, I would be looking at sharing mail with someone who would be happy to continue it over a longer period of time (provided the conversation flows of course!).

Demographics don't really matter, and I am happy to mail overseas provided you are too if abroad.

It's hard to write something like this without slipping into that horrible, token personals-ad-esque pattern of writing. I guess that's what we all revert to when forced to write about ourselves. 

I'm a pretty sincere person. I have wide ranging interests and an interesting job as a reporter. I play and write music too. But I'm kind of in a rut. As much as my job forces me to get out and talk to new people, I find it harder to do that on my own time. I have friends, I'm not a loner; but those friends just straight up don't interest me. And I hate pretending. I'm a functional introvert, you might say. 

So I'm looking for someone who is a deep thinker and a critical thinker. Breadth and depth! You don't have to be a fucking genius, I just want someone who doesn't vacantly nod when I try to talk about something more multifaceted than which bar we're going to next because Jess is meeting us there and oh my god you guys I think I left my cellphone on the pool table *retch*.

I'm an atheist. You don't need to be, but I'm not looking for tired theological debates either. 

Male or Female. Not looking for someone from a particular location, but I strongly prefer someone who can write in English with confidence.

Thanks for having a look at my post!

My name is Jess, I'm 18 (19 on the 2nd of Jan) and I was born in South Wales in the UK. However, I recently moved to Glasgow in Scotland for university, where I am happily studying law.

I'm mixed race. My father's side of the family are from England/Wales/Ireland;my mother's side of the family is a lot more interesting - South African/Malay, Dutch, Israeli, and Brazilian.

Anyway.

I've done snail-mail for a long time. I think I started it when I was about 11 when I met my first penpal on holiday in Canada. Since then I've joined certain websites which were just for penpalling(?) and it's really been one of the best things I've done with my life.

I'm pretty interested in music. I play the piano, violin and guitar, and when I want to deafen people, I sing for them, hahaha. I like to be creative; I love cooking, baking, making handmade/homemade gifts for people and all that. And of course I love writing letters!

:o Oh! I ramble a fair bit too! So if you don't like to have long messages with someone, i guess that I'm not really the penpal for you! :(

I hope someone replies to me. When you get to know me, you'll realise that I'm quite funny and down to earth.

So yeah! If anything here interests you, PLEASE get in touch with me!

I look forward to talking to you soon! :D

Disaffected writer/game designer looking for snail mail pen pals to confide in about hobbies, philosophy, nature, the world, whatever",ThoreauIsCool,16,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/14lusp/19musa_and_again_disaffected_writergame_designer/,"Hi there /r/penpals. I made a post here a while back, though unfortunately many people never followed up on their requests. I'm hoping I can build more correspondences and relationships with people, so I'm open to more letters.

I'm a very introverted and whimsical person who has absolutely no idea what he wants to do with his life and spends more time analyzing whether or not his every action will be meaningful/worthwhile to him in the longterm than he does actually acting on those actions.

I don't want to ramble too much about myself here since there's plenty of time for that later on, but game modding/level design, graphic design, fiction and writing are my primary interests. Escapism of most any kind - senses of being in particular places and times, whether it's through the painted backgrounds of old cartoons or fiction, there's this powerfully compelling sense of ""presence"" and desire for that sense of a world as it has been and would always be that garners my most emotive appreciations. If you catch me in the right mood, I love long, meandering conversations with people about philosophy, ramblings about inconsequential observations, things like that.

I'm also a country kind of a person, and I love the outdoors, archery, woodworking and other miscellaneous things like that - although I sadly rarely have the time/resources to do them often. I love reading and learning things hands-on rather than idly in the classroom. I love oldies and indie rock, as well as some random genres like celtic music. I don't understand why it's so hard to find jazz-rock these days.

As a person who's always interested in adventure, stories, experiences, culture and anquity, I feel disillusioned with what I perceive to be the cold and culturally bland time period we live in. I love the physicality of writing letters, cobbling together journals and scrapbooks, the like - and would love to make some pen pals in the hopes of making some genuinely substantive conversations and connections with people.

A little about me.  I'm thirty and live alone with two cats in Louisville, KY. It's a nice city, part mid-Western and part Southern. I like old buildings.  Sometimes I like to play a game where I cram as many pre-war buildings into my line of sight as possible without getting a post-war in there.  It's fun; you should try it.  Then try to figure out where the streetcars used to run and if that has any bearing on the way the buses do.  Then wonder what you're doing with your life.

For a living I make pretzels and sausages at a local gastropub.  It's very fulfilling work albeit sometimes stressful.  Cooking is one of those obsessions of mine.  I really enjoy regional delicacies, beer, and such like.  I spend a lot of time thinking about that stuff.  

I play drums in a rock 'n' roll band.  It's really just a flimsy pretext to bang on the skins, hang out, and occasionally do omething in front of some other people for free beer.  It's great.  Everyone should try it.

I also really love pinball.  I even own a couple of machines and you're right.  That's ridiculous.  But there's something nice about fixing things and having a sexy alien lady you brought back from the dead who now tells you to try a tube shot.  

I have pretty good hand-writing, a fountain pen, and a collection of stamps ready to go.  If that doesn't sell me I don't know what will.  In fact, the post office is often putting out all kinds of totally excellent stamps.  It's great.

Well, that's me in a nutshell.  I've been tossing this off rather extemporaneously but this is a pretty good indicator of what a letter from me would be like.

I will admit, if you like steamy, erotica books, its for you lol...almost done the first book, onto the second, then the third. 
Pen Pal Info:
How many pen pals do you have? Right now, i have one rad lady, weve actually become very close and have come to the point where we now call each other soul sisters because its sooo crazy how much were alike and all that good stuff :)
Do you hand write or type? I have a typewriter which I do use regularly, but I do enjoy printing/writing letters as well.

Snail mail or email? Snail mail please! I also have skype, so maybe once were more acquainted, we will do that.

How long are your letters? It depends on life and how much the other person wrote, so i could go from there as well. I do like putting together little packages full of surprises... I'd love to exchange photos, postcards, art, cd's etc. I want someone who will actually keep writing, i have tried to have a few penpals and they either get busy in life and not respond or not even tell me they wont write anymore, so, please, someone who will actually respond.

How long does it take you to reply to a letter? depends if i can afford the postage stamps right away or not...but i will let you know on lj or any other type of communication we may also partake in when i have sent the letter.

What sex do you want them to be? I have a rad female one, and i like to try have a male penpal if possible... 

Where do you want them to be from? outside of canada but im really looking for someone in ireland, dublin, if i can be choosey ahah

I made a post a week or so ago offering to [make cards](http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/xswb8/22fusa_making_cards_for_anyone_who_wants_them_one/) for people in a one time penpal exchange.  I'm having a fun time making cards for anyone who wants one in addition to meeting new people on r/penpals.  Yet sadly it has left me craving something more that a one-time mail exchange can't satiate.    

Now I want to vamp it up into something a little more serious.  I thought, you know, we can start off slow with just some cozy little PMs. Then after a bit, we can move on up to steadily emailing each other back and forth.  And finally we make the big leap to - and stay with me on this - *[full fledged letters](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ4Fb_NIXiM)*.

I know, I know.  That's a shockingly bold proposition for you.  However, perhaps you're a bit intrigued as well.  Maybe you want to read more about this wordy bastard inundating you with bad, snarky humor. But why, you might be asking yourself. She hasn't said anything of consequence.  What's her favorite color?  Does she have any siblings? What kinds of bands does she like? What's her stance on the war in Syria?  And holy mother of god, *does she know who stole the cookie from the cookie jar*?

Right now at this very moment you're torn between clicking the downvote button of doom and moving on with your life (if indeed you have read this far into what is quite clearly, quickly becoming *The Odyssey* of penpal posts) Or -and maybe there's just that little flickering flame of interest left within you - your fingers are twitching above the keyboard miming out a response you're hesitant to send to this mystery girl that talks too much.  Dare you do it?  Dare you not?  Will you regret your decision?

Blast it, you've spent enough time agonizing over your decision.  With new resolve you set your fingers to the keyboard and

##About Myself

* I used to live in a shitty small town in southern Virginia from 2007-2011.

* I now live in the twin cities here in Minnesota and love it.

* I'm at a bit of a crossroads with what I'd like to do with myself. Nursing?

* Ex-smoker of over three months.

* As time passes, I am growing to be less of a socialite and tend to avoid face-to-face communication with those I'm not already familiar with.

* Music is a constant in my life. My spare time is often spent messing about with various acoustic stringed instruments.

* Most days, I'd much rather read a book or see a movie than play a game or watch television. I don't own a t.v. or any consoles. My media is pretty PC-centric.

* Give me English comedians like Ricky Gervais, Jimmy Carr, and Russell Howard.

* I'm toying around with learning a bit of Bulgarian.

* Ask me about anything else. I'm fairly open.

Music. I am open to all kinds of music, however, i'm most keen on indie rock, alternative rock, and i suppose downtempo (Portishead). 

I'm currently unemployed, and as such have oodles of time to be writing letters/drawing silly pictures. I also think it would be nice to recieve a handwritten letter in the mail once in a while.

All in all, looking forward to hearing from someone!

Let us uncover the human condition.",Mythodiir,13,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1i1ky1/17mcanada_looking_for_someone_to_regale_with_my/,"I live in a province called Alberta. I think it's fine here but I definitely don't want to stay here. I, myself am an atheist, or well, an agnostic if you want to be technical. I'm agnostic about gods and deities in much the same way I'm agnostic about Santa Clause or the Tooth Fairy. I'm currently fasting, as it is the first day of Ramadan. As you can tell, I come from an Islamic family. I'm looking to enter a Canadian university after I finish my final year of highschool, which is coming right around the corner. 

I'm deeply infatuated with history and I make a thing out of contextualizing. Personally, to me it feels as though I've spent most of my life contextualizing. I dislike the label ""Brito-phile"", just typing it makes me feel strange, and I try not to seem as such, but for a Canadian I am peculiarly knowledgeable of that dingy Island to the east. Now, I know that now you're thinking I'm some sort of pseudo-intellectual teenager who thinks they know what they're talking about. A large part of my contextualizing is in part mixed with my pessimism and lack of confidence. I could pour my soul into something and believe it, in my eyes, to have been one of the greatest works that I have ever accomplished, and I would still assume that some one other than myself looking at it would simply scoff and tell me it's trash. 

See, I never grew a sense of self, or belonging, or confidence. I am incredibly smug, and I know my own standards, but I honestly assume that others always assume the worst of me. Now this likely ties in to my childhood. When I was in elementary I was fairly confident, I always knew what to say, and I'd say it loud, and proud. I believed in myself, but every single one of my peers despised me. I was ridiculed and insulted. Now looking back, I was a bit of a smart-ass back then but that went to scar my character. I regressed back into my shell of self loathing. Now, you might think that I'd have parents to console me. I came from a family of nine, by the time I was ten I had three younger siblings. 

Now, I'm not complaining about my lack of confidence, I'm seventeen, I am responsible for myself. The past is behind me, I'm not a child anymore. This is a time where I come to understand my psychology and I become who I want to be, not the same awkward child who couldn't handle some school yard bullying. I'm just glad I'm seventeen and I know who I want to be rather than finding out too late. Now, of course, tying back to my earlier note, looking at this must be awfully cringeworthy. Strangers on the internet divulging their introverted self-analysis in a pseudo-intellectual manner, such as I have done would make anyone cringe. Or maybe you've read this and you kind of understand where it is I'm coming from. I don't claim to know much, or anything. 

I think I might know some things well. Who's it to which I'm comparing myself when I look to see how well I know the things that I do? I don't think I'm that great, or that magnificent, but I do want to know... things... and now it's crappy quote time.

&gt;""A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other."" ~ Charles Dickens

I actually memorized that quote word for word, but I did consult A Tale of Two Cities simply to make sure I didn't mis-quote. I was always immensely impressed by Christopher Hitchen's ability to just recall quotes from the depths of his mind. It's almost as if he memorizes them immediately after reading them. Of course, he likely just sits around for 15 minutes digesting the quote on his lonesome like I do. Still, it's an amazing ability. 

Of course the thing about quotes is that they're almost always as if you're invoking a higher intellect to support your very own statement, which puts to question, must one consult to a higher intellect to validate a point? I guess if you aren't particularly knowledgeable of the point, but if you know the quote then by proxy you should grasp the knowledge which the quote offers. 

Either way, I feel as though Dickens is onto something, people are in their nature inquisitive of others. It is of humanity to uncover ourselves. I guess I might be getting too upitty with what I can assume. Maybe those assumptions, as nice as they sound, are simply assumptions. Now, if you happen to become my pen-pal, the ideas that I send you will vary in their organizational level. 

This is probably the very base of my writing style. The uninterrupted train of thought. If you like doing the same, or shall I say, like me, or not me, but my ideas, or not even my ideas, but something of the prospect of being my pen-pal, then go ahead and send a message. 

We can do this over e-mail, reddit PMs, et cetera. And if you want to play videogames, chat, watch movies together, or anything else over the internet, I have NetFlix, most of the games by Paradox Interactive (CKII, VictoriaII, EUIII, CiM, EU:Rome), Minecraft, et cetera.

Email kills me, I spend so much time going over and over my postings to make sure it says what I mean and that it can't be misinterpreted. The same goes for postings on reddit, 4chan, or other boards. Even this is difficult, I'm constantly editing/deleting parts so that it doesn't sound weird.

I wasn't always like this, I used to communicate in online games, post on imageboards, and be able to communicate normally. Now I get too nervous when I want to post, and I just back out of it.

I would like to break out of this, it's not the right way to go about communicating. I would very much appreciate it if anyone would like to write letters over email, on any topic. Hopefully if I can get into a flow of writing emails again, I can get back some of my confidence.

My first language is English, however I have a  basic understanding of Swedish (level 2), so it might be fun to communicate in that if anyone is interested.

PM me if you're interested in an email penpal, or post here and I'll PM you back with an address. Maybe if you're browsing /r/penpals for the first time and are unsure who to talk to, this might be a good starting point.

This is my first time trying out something like this. Just to give a bit of a background introduction: I've always enjoyed the process of snail mail — from writing the letter to licking the stamp (no I kid, I don't actually lick stamps... or do I?) to receiving a letter in return — it gives me a bit of a cheap thrill. However, most of my friends aren't into this sort of thing so I decided to search elsewhere :(  

I don't draw very well but I consider myself to be a little artsy (read: I just have a ton of stickers I don't know where else to use them). If I send you a letter, you will most likely receive a ""tuck-in"" as well. It could be a piece of origami or a handwritten poem — basically anything that tickles my fancy for the day. We can talk about anything and everything: knitting, deforestation, the last time you had a haircut, etc. The possibilities are endless.  

If you haven't clicked the back button on your browser by now, it might interest you to know that some of my hobbies include literature, languages, philosophy, botany, astronomy etc. This list is sadly non-exhaustive :(   

I think I am rambling too much, sigh. If you're the kind of person who likes to read long paragraphs of inane prattling, I might be a suitable penpal.

I've had this idea of getting into learning philosophy for some time, and had brief attempts at it, but found having someone to discuss it with would make it much more fun.

It would also be ok if we don't study together, only have conversations about the topic, but I must say if you're a specialist then I probably won't match your level.

A bit about me: 
I like being outside in nature and enjoy going on hikes. I have been hiking in the north of Sweden and once slept in a cloud at quite some altitude. Protip: Nothing dries in a cloud.

 I like cooking, I didn't say I am very good at it but I still like it. I usually make real easy food but I'd like to improvemy cooking but it's hard with the budget of a student.

I like watching movies and reading. I kind of like to watch and read almost anything but something about sci-fi and fantasy is more intriguing to me. I also am a big fan of documentaries and a Discovery-addict.

I like playing videogames and I am abit worried about my backlog of games I have to play through. I've been saving Arkham City for this summer since I really liked Arkham Asylum for instance. I am worried about Bioshock: Infinite going to take up a huge amount of my time as well. 

I am just looking for some nice people to talk to about whatever. Tell me how your day has been or maybe some cool recipes or share some photos or talk about whatever. I'd prefer to use email or something along those lines since my handwriting is horrible.

I think every person has an interesting story from which I can learn and experience the world in a different way than my own, so I would like to get to know you and learn what makes you special and what you think about life, the universe and everything :)

I'm 20 years old and live in Hamburg, Germany, maybe the most beautiful city in the world. My interests lie in writing, reading, outdoors, music, movies, games and of course in law, because that's what I study at uni. I think a lot about life, what our purpose in life is, about other people and myself. But I am no introvert but like to meet new people and try to find out what differs them from the others. My love-life is almost always complicated, although I think an interesting women can be the most exciting creature in this world. I love to talk about love, boys and girls and sex (nothing dirty intended) and what other people think about it and how they experience it.

My greatest wish is simply to write the best book that has ever been written and read, because I want to show people what a life with purpose and meaning can achieve and how fulfilling it can be.

I hope that we can share our experiences, talk about what is important and the little things in life. If you want to exchange letters I'd be glad to read your PM to get a first impression :) Beware though, I live in germany so the will be postal charges.

I don't like being open without a certain measure of anonymity or knowledge of my audience.

Anyway, I'm 33, a guy, married, no children, and typically test as an INTP or INTJ. I've recently tested as an INFP, so I'm not sure how much stock I really put in these personality tests. Regardless, I think I'm more like a caramel-swirl ice cream, with these different personality types all mixed, but forming layers instead of one homogeneous blob. Plus, one of them gets to be caramel; that's exciting.

I can't stress this enough: I'm *introverted*, not *shy*. That is a fine point sometimes overlooked.

I enjoy astronomy (specifically), the sciences (in general), and skeptical thought. I love exploring the hypothetical, with the acceptance that my speculations are probably wrong. I don't care for sports, but sports don't bother me.

When in the mood, I enjoy being **lost** in music. [Here](http://youtu.be/8lSpD7cd9Hg) [are](http://youtu.be/RfKcu_ze-60) [some](http://youtu.be/9Q397xZoMSQ) of [my](http://youtu.be/gs5nzdDExoQ) [*favorite*](http://youtu.be/It4WxQ6dnn0) [examples](http://youtu.be/qlal62Xx0cQ). (I really like [""Hum""](http://youtu.be/QiZbDp1JOCM).) I usually listen to podcasts in the car, or some type of music not nearly as relaxing.

I don't always listen to music. Sometimes silence is nice.

I've never been very wild, but I tried LSD once with a close friend. It was an interesting experience. Very introspective.

I feel like I missed most of my childhood, so I'm trying to play catch-up without being irresponsible or focusing on the past too much.

I was raised by two manipulative and emotionally abusive women, but I try not to make it a centerpiece for my existence. I've worked my way through most of the damage done. 

Despite the above, I seem to get along with women better than men. I feel like hanging out with women (platonically) makes my wife uncomfortable, though. I understand, so it unfortunately doesn't happen.

I work way too much. I've heard that I should be glad to have a job, but that doesn't satisfy me. Maybe it should...?

Like many people in my position, I feel that I have a fairly well developed sense of humor to use as a coping mechanism.

I'm looking for interesting folks to exchange e-mails with (or reddit messages) on a fairly regular basis. I suppose you'd call that a ""pen-pal"", ~but~ I enjoy depth in conversation ~and feel that ""pen-pal"" doesn't convey that.~ Scratch that, I think I'm wrong.

Also. I'm kind of neurotic. I'm a bit on the crazy side and have a wild view of the world. I play the Devil's Advocate a lot in life and will almost always see at least two sides of a story, if not the possibility of more.

I'm a 21 year old university student from Norway. Many years ago I had a penpal and I thought it would be fun to try it again. I'm especially looking for penpals from outside Europe, but if you are an European and find this interesting don't hesitate to send me a PM anyway. Face to face I am somewhat shy so I figured this would be a good way to make some new friends from different parts of the world. I'm not just looking forward to getting to know you, as I'm also excited to learn about other cultures and what life is like in different countries.

When I'm not busy studying urban planning at the university I enjoy exercising (mostly running), watching movies (I watch almost anything) and listening to music/going to concerts. My music taste used to be just rock and metal but it has evolved a lot since then. Now I listen to pretty much anything from black/death metal to soul. I also like travelling even if I haven't travelled much the last few years due to studies and work. 

I'd like to start by exchanging emails. But I'd love to change to snailmail if the email exchange works well and we hit it off as penpals. I'm also going to move soon, so that could cause some trouble for snailmail exchange right away. I usually just get bills in the mail. Would be nice to get some letters from a penpal for a change!

What I have in mind essentially would be that you and I are communicating by one of the few means that are not being monitored or something similar... living in a dystopian totalitarian type environment (be it similar to that of The Electric Church by Jeff Somers as a very general example.)

We communicate via an 'underground' 'unmonitored' system of mail delivery which is run by a group of counteragents... etc

We can exchange anything from letters, to maps, to our (made up) ""plans"" to small packages with nik naks to add a real feel to it all.

I have some more ideas in mind but if any of this sounds appealing to you PM me and we can discuss the theme a bit deeper, and develop our characters a bit and then proceed to snail mail communication.

**SNAIL MAIL ONLY** once we talk through PMs for a short amount of time I would like to transition into the *snail mail* portion of this asap. 

*P.S.* I don't mind where you are from for this could be in or out of USA but if we are both in the USA it may help make for some common ground, or if you are out of the USA we can modify the story so that you have a reason for being out of the country, and it would make for fun map exchanges etc!

- I'm an aspiring author and poet, and every so often try my hand at other mediums of art.

- Love music, play guitar, trumpet, and fail at the violin. Rock and Metal are my favorite genres, but I listen to pretty much everything.

- I speak an interesting mix of California Beachbum/Southern/Midwest farmboy vernacular. I'll probably end up mixing together idioms that don't make sense to most people at some point.

- Huge gamer. Built myself a pretty beasty gaming rig, and play PS3 when I have a TV to play on.

- Most importantly, I love to learn and creative and be silly. I'd love to talk to someone that can stimulate me, or be just as equally silly.

* is willing to point me at my mistakes (I'll do my best to make as few as possible)

Books are tougher, but I still read in English from time to time.

Thanks for looking at this. I know times are rough for all of us nowadays. I have been feeling down lately. I lost my fiancé. I've been permanently taken out of work due to severe chronic back pain with nerve damage so after I lost my fiancé, I had to move in with my parents until I can save up money to buy/rent my own place. I was an EMT for six years and I miss helping people in need. I do my best to do one kind thing for a stranger when the opportunity presents itself to me. I loved my job as I met many people(though it really isn't the best job for a germaphobe such as myself...but I did it to help people during their time of need. Even though it's an extremely thankless job and more often than not you will be beat up, spit on, peed on, crapped on, puked on, bled on, and coughed on...but I learned so much about the human capacity to survive. I learned far more than I wanted to about bureaucracy and became a victim of circumstance in order for my bosses to keep buying houses in the Hamptons, Lexus/BMW/Jaguar/even a Ferrari, designer clothes, private schooling for their kids while the people doing all the hard manual work are breaking their backs trying to get the work done. They stacked calls, would send a crew that was well over two hours away from the pick up destination when there was a crew closer to the pick up. Too many close calls when death was knocking on the door for many of our patients. Thankfully, all are well. Whew!

I have a wide variety of interests: I like computers, art, music(all kinds honestly. I have eclectic tastes. I dabble in it all), movies, learning new things, trying new experiences, traveling, going to Broadway shows, playing the piano, training my dogs/caring for dogs, going on long drives, XBox/3DS/PS3/Wii/iPhone/iPod/Nook...I like electronics and games. I like to volunteer and help others where I can whenever I can, especially people who suffer from chronic pain and/or have sustained/live with and care for someone who has a traumatic brain injury. I sustained one at 17 from a car accident where my old for pick-up truck landed on my head. These are just the tip of the iceberg. I like to watch: NCIS, True Blood, Breaking Bad, Perception is actually pretty good,  Psych, Once Upon a Time, Fringe, 24, Prison Break, Royal Pains, Final Witness, Most Evil, Criminal Minds, Sister Wives, Family Guy, South Park,
30 Rock, just getting into The Big Bang Theory, Monty Python/Little Britain/Absolutely Fabulous...I'm always looking for something new to try.

I like all kinds of movies and try to see a new one once or twice a week. Dark Knight Rises is going to be awesome!!!!
I love going to the movies...even though certain ones remind me of my fiancé. Sigh...it's been hard but nothing that can't be overcome.

If I were to list everything I listen to here...it would be a very long list. 

Writing is a passion of mine as I do wish to be published one day. I made a promise to someone to get his life story published but his ended before the ending I had anticipated so it remains unwritten. He was one of the greatest people I used to know and I miss him greatly. He is lost forever and the world has lost what light he could have given us all. It's funny how unpredictable life is sometimes...I would have freely taken his place if the fates let me, but it wasnt to be.

I LOVE to read and I do so everyday. I read a lot of crime novels both true and fictional. I like science and medicine based fiction or factual books. I also am extremely interested in psychology and how certain events influence a person's thoughts/emotions. I'd like to go back to school to study computers in order to become a computer crime analyst for the FBI/CIA/NSA or whichever. I do not believe in law but I do believe in justice and doing the right thing even when the right thing means you will be standing alone as well as accepting responsibility for your actions. Laws are broken and manipulated by the very people who put them in action. 

I like meeting new people and learning about their lives. I just want to be a nice person to all even when people are not so nice to me. There isn't enough kindness spread in this world; it's become a dead quality to some since  nowadays it is viewed as weakness...or at least in my area of NJ...especially guys my age. It's been hard to cope with what I've had to this year but I'm getting through it as best I can. 

You can talk with me about anything and I wont judge you. It is not my place to do so and I have had my fair share of stones cast at me by people I thought I could trust. I'm learning a lot about life this year. After my head injury, I spent many years playing catch up to my peers, always feeling as though I have been left behind. I finally caught up to my age group after eleven years of relearning and learning the harsh realities that are considered the accepted norm in society. Too many people are trying to be like their peers and lose their identity from joining the flock. I have been tormented and rejected because I don't fit into one definitive group. I'm an anomaly in that I could belong to many groups but chose to stay on the outside in order to observe to see how the group behaves toward others. 

If you would like to be my pen pal, I really appreciate it and am more than happy to contact you in any way that is feasible for you. Please send me a PM if you are interested so I may provide you with the necessary contact information. Just let me know how you would like to contact me. Since I haven't quite figured out Skype yet, I am not able to communicate with you on there for the time being but I am figuring it out little by little. 

Thank you for reading this. I really appreciate it. If you are going through a rough spot in your life, I am happy to listen and will only offer advice at your request. Thanks again. Have a wonderful rest of your day!

Not in a romantic sense really, but someone else out there who might seem like a regular person among their peers, while at the same time feels like there's something a bit off about who they are when they are alone. Someone who fits in maybe, but fits in awkwardly. I know I'm probably describing everybody or nobody at all, but if that description means something to you, then, I guess, read on...

I like watching movies, in my own pace. I wouldn't call myself a movie buff. My favorite directors are Wes Anderson and Richard Linklater. I also like Tom Tykwer. I guess, just to give you a bit of an idea. I like music also. I don't concentrate on any particular band or genre, but I like some indiefolk and some jazz. Some classical piano is good too. I mean, anything would be okay really, as long as it sounds good and gives me a good daydream. I usually like songs that have a bit of deeper meaning maybe, or possibly no meaning at all but it has to sound like it's got some deep shit going on, you know? I guess I like poetry too. Walt Whitman is a favorite.

I like doodling on my phone and just sending it on e-mail. Maybe write a few words that don't make sense and then sending that on e-mail. Some pseudo-haikus. Some random pictures of stuff here and there. I'd throw in a little bit of Instagram shit too. Hey, if you's a hater... you might as well know I like that shit. I mean, I don't think of myself as a photographer just because I like to take pictures of trees and my dog, but I use it, okay? Also, I like getting to know people and people getting to know me too.

I am Lucas, and I write a letter writing/fountain pen/stationery blog called [Lucas Writes](http://lucas-writes.blogspot.com).  I started my blog as an excuse to actually use the pens that I love, the ink that I adore, and the paper I obsess over when I should be doing other things.  

I love writing letters.  I love sending postcards.  Below, you will find a brief description of myself... if you'd like to write me, feel free!  The address is on my blog.  And if you do... tell me you're from Reddit :)

The Basics : Lucas, 27, male, work in the banking industry (I play Spreadsheet Hero all day!), have a passion for music, trained opera singer, have been a violinist since 5, and a cellist at 11. Competitive Irish Dancer until a car accident left me with an ankle injury. New to fountain pens, but have always loved having a pen pal!

Hobbies/Tidbits : Irish dance, music and culture; musical theater, opera, ballet, Netflix Streaming, Hulu+, British television (better than most American shows), Glee, writing, dachshunds, video games, and random YouTube videos. I dabble in politics a bit (an open-minded Democrat, if I have to choose a label), and I'm always open for a decent debate as long as it doesn't end in a shouting match. Religion hasn't been a big part of my life, but I love learning about them.

Two things of note - When I write to a pen pal, it's usually over several days and with short bursts of what's happening right now in my life. Given a topic, I'm prone to write for pages and pages. And, because it will probably come up in our conversation, I am homosexual, but it's not something I focus on, and I may only mention it in passing. If this bothers you, we probably won't be a good match.

My goal is simple really; to find a person willing to carry hearty conversations that fill the soul, replenish the mind, and expand the confines of one's individual cognitive fixedness with no inherent ""strings attached."" Fear not though, as there are no specific requirements to gain a companion on your journey through the cosmic ebb and flow of life.

I come from an americanized Mexican family, although I prefer to believe I am the love child of Magneto and Hannibal Lecter, with Ron Burgundy as my adoptive father. My heros are Carl Sagan and Dr. Michio Kaku, but if we're getting theoretical, my fictional hero is Fox Mulder. 
Now, I have contemplated the ways I would go about detailing myself and my areas of favor, but all seem riddled with contempt or egotism. So I shall simply list them quite plainly and simply, and allow you to decide for yourselves the extent in wish to pursue pen-pal companionship.

Boston girl temporarily in California visiting family.
I'm always smiling or laughing.

I'm looking for an electronic penpal. I'm a talker, I love meeting new people and making new friends. I use smiley faces a lot. Sorry not sorry.

Just a little bit about me:
I'm 23, and a paralegal. I'm from what I consider to be the greatest city in the world (Boston) and a proud member of Red Sox Nation. I'm really good at pop culture trivia, anything involving technology, dancing, socializing, remembering things, taking care of people. I'm very nostalgic. 

Favorite Movies: Gone with the Wind, Wizard of Oz, Almost Famous, Empire Records, Breakfast at Tiffany's (Or anything with Audrey Hepburn in it) Goodfellas, Jurassic Park, Lord of the Rings.. I could go all day. I'm a huge film buff.

Favorite Music: Beatles, DMB, Dylan, Marina and the Diamonds, anything from the 80's and anything I can dance to. Music is a huge part of my life. 

Favorite TV Shows: 24, Mad Men, The original Star Trek series, Suits, The X-Files, Girls, Grey's Anatomy, etc.

Other than that, I can usually be found sitting on my front porch, showing a stranger how to use their smartphone, jailbreaking an Apple product, running to catch the T, chatting with strangers in line at the grocery store, helping my family with something ridiculous, hiding out in random corners of Barnes and Noble reading, or playing with some kind of animal.

I recently moved to Florida to go to an art school and study film, so I my interests include drawing, painting, and graphic design. I sort of play the piano, the harmonica and the recorder--although I'm getting better--and I've been playing around with software that lets you orchestrate virtual orchestras, which is kinda cool. I've written novels, half-finished screenplays, designed games--of both board and video variety-- and I'm bilingual.

Most importantly though: I can juggle.

I also like science, enjoy math, chemistry and physics, and I'm a skeptic at heart. Boring, I know.

Although it's nice to have things in common, I think it would be fun to have our differences, too. It would be cool to get to know someone who lives life differently, whether that because of a difference in culture or interests.

I never had a pen pal, but I love writing and I really need to improve my english-skills, so why not writing? (need to improve speech as well though, but that is another thing)

I currently study media computer science (almost done) and I am an open person, though I'm sometimes very socially awkward ... I know it sounds odd and somehow illogical, but ... well. I love music (mostly post-punk, indie, some dark stuff, 80s), but also ... well, everything. When I like something, I like it, no matter if it's dubstep, pop, chiptunes, hip hop or whatever. I'm not a friend of labeling and this goes for almost everything in my life. There is also no kind of person I would reject because of their taste or problems or ... whatever ... (only if they were complete assholes. :D)

I like photography, singing, reading, sometimes drawing/painting, writing of course, and I also started learning the piano (didn't get very far), but well. Ain't nobody got time for all that while studying ... 

But I feel that conversation with human beings is of more importance right now (do have a SO, but not many friends to talk to, because well, SAP). I just want somebody to ""write"" to and learn about other lives, relationships, views, tastes (of music, books, art, games) ... whatever.

This is my first post on /r/penpals and I'm eager to try it out. Snail mail, e-mail, Skype, it all works for me! The title says it all really, but to break the ice, I'll tell you a bit about myself.
  
  My name is Braden and I'm a Junior who lives in North Carolina, originally from Southern California(I promise I'm not a hillbilly). I consider myself an extrovert and I love learning about other peoples lives, I have a dream of travelling the world some day when I'm out of college. Foreigners fascinate me, I was in a USA-Denmark Exchange program last year and it was one of the best experiences of my life. Some of my greatest enjoyment in life comes from being active; physically, socially, I just love being in stimulating environments with stimulating people. I'm a Pole-Vaulter and a Cross-Country runner, in the past I dabbled in Wrestling but who can take two sweaty guys man handling each other seriously? If you're an outdoor hammocker then I would like to officially invite you to the cool club, you're one of us and we're going to be friends.

But I can be an indoorsy person too. I love Doctor Who, Tennant is my favorite(how original). Im pretty freakin awesome at Starcraft II, unless you're Zerg, then I'll probably lose. Anything electronic is appealing to my ears as far as music goes. My favorite book series are  Ender's Game and Eragon, and I truly think the Universe is the most beautiful thing ever.

As far as life goals are concerned, I plan on going into poly sci/law/international affairs. I haven't really decided yet :p I'm currently signed with an Acting/Modeling Talent agency and this summer I'm taking a trip to LA to hopefully get some work! 

If you have any interest in starting up something just PM me, I'll be up for any method really! ",,False,,t5_2r076,False,,,True,t3_1d4g7k,http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1d4g7k/17mus_i_want_to_make_some_friends/,
