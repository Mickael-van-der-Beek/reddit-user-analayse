1342020669.0,120,self.Canning,wdzx9,How Canning saved my life...,a_c_munson,130,10,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/wdzx9/how_canning_saved_my_life/,"It was 1994. I found out I was pregnant. I had had 2 negative pregnancy tests and when I got a positive one I went to the Doctor and found out I was 3 months pregnant. A few weeks later I turned 22. 

The ""Dad"" had a Daughter with his EX by June and at the end of July they went on a Trip out of state to visit relatives.

It was August in Minnesota. August in Minnesota is HOT. I Lived in a very old House that did not have any kind of air conditioning.  IT was sweltering. I am out of work and pregnant.  I am alone while my ""Boy Friend"" is traveling with his Ex. ( Over the course of this trip, the ex became less ex but I am getting ahead of myself.)
 A family friend who has a small apple orchard had gifted me with 3 bushels of apples.  I didn't start canning until after 10 pm. I have always been a night owl and with the heat it only made sense to be canning at night.  I am canning apple sauce. I sterilized the Jars, band and lids on the stove top. I have run the cooked applies through a food mill and I load the Jars. By the time I set the timer for the processing time for the last batch it is 3 am. I sit down hot and tired.  As I look down I notice that my pants are soaked from the crotch to the knees.

Oh SHIT! my water broke.  I call my Doctor then I call a friend she come over and we wait for a Cab to pick us up and take us to the hospital. I get to the hospital and they rush me to the maternity floor. No contractions yet so That is good but I am only 29 weeks pregnant. Through out all of this I feel fine, I have felt great my entire pregnancy. I am calm. I am sure everything will be fine. 

I see the Doctor, he does an exam and asked if my dates are right. Because the baby is too small. ""My dates were set by ultra sound they have to be right, don't they?""  The Doctor isn't smiling. They do a pelvic. I am not dilated and my water didn't break but I am not going home either.

  My Mom has arrived and she is asking questions but they don't have a lot of answers. They give me a neo-stress test and I failed. No ifs and or buts something is wrong. They tell me that although my Doctor has delivered preemies before, never have they been this little. He is sending me to Abbot Northwestern, it is attached to Children's Hospital in Minneapolis.  They let my Mom drive me there. It takes about an hour. 

When they admit me to Abbot is when I begin to understand that something is really wrong. You know how when you check in to a Hospital you spend an hour filling out paperwork? 
     When we arrive they put me in a wheelchair and rush me to a room. I am in the ICU. They hook me up to an IV, they put me on oxygen and I get hooked up to a fetal monitor. 
But although my Baby is in distress we don't know what is wrong with her and we don't know why she is so small. 

I remember when the phlebotomist came in to put in the IV. She had a cart full of test tubes. I asked her if she was doing blood draws for the whole floor. She told me ""No, these are all for you"". In all she filled 34 little vials with my blood. When the test results came in we find out I am loosing my Liver and Kidney function, but we don't know why.

 Over all it takes 2 days in the ICU before we have a diagnosis. preeclampsia AKA pregnancy high blood pressure. My normal blood pressure at the time was 80 over 60 or so, When I was admitted it was 130/80. Which isn't too high, but a 50 point increase is life threatening.  The treatment is magnisum solfate by IV. a Magnisum Solfate IV makes you feel like you are drunk all the time. The doctor also prescribed a float in the physical therapy pool on the main floor twice a day.  So twice a day I get wheeled down to the pool. I change into my suit and get an inner-tube. I float in the pool and my oxygen tank and iv drip tether me to the edge.  Like a intoxicated bobber attached to a fishing line.

I get hormone shots to speed up the lung development of the baby. I get my blood drawn twice a day to check on my liver and kidneys.

  After all most 2 weeks of this I wake up at 4 in the morning and my chest hurts. It is like an elephant is sitting on me. I am having trouble breathing and it HURTS. I ring for the nurse. She pages my Doctor. They wheel in an ex ray machine and take a film of my chest. My heart monitor is going off and I black out. I wake up a few minutes later and my chest still hurts and I am being wheeled into the operating room. 

We have tried to reach ""Dad"" to no avail. My friend who has stayed with me in the hospital since I called her 2 weeks ago is wearing scrubs. I am told that I can't feel anything below my chest because they had put in a spinal block. (which is a relief, waking up and not being able to move half your body is freaky scary) My lung had collapsed and my heart is in distress it had briefly stopped.

In the operating room they put up a drape below my chest. In just a few minutes I hear her cry and the doctor says ""I can't believe this little peanut is breathing on her own."" They clean her up press her briefly to my face and put her in an isollet. My Friend runs down the hall next to my Daughter and her Doctor and Nurse. They are bringing her to Children's Hospital. It is really just down the elevator and across the hall. I get told she is 1 lb 15oz and 13 inches long. 

I am in the OR while they clean me up and staple me closed. My Mom watched as they brought bag after bag of blood soaked gauze out of the room. In recovery they tell me to sleep. I won't. 

After 2 hours in recovery They wheel my bed to the elevator, we go down the hall. They wheel me into the PICU. I get to see my Daughter and touch her hand through the isolette. Her Doctor comes in and says it is ok for me to hold her. We raise up the head of the bed and I get to hold my daughter. 17 weeks ago I found out I was pregnant. 2 weeks ago I was canning apple sauce and though my water had broken. My Doctor said if I hadn't gone to the Hospital that night, If I hadn't gotten magnisum solfate when I did that I would have lost my liver and kidney function, I would have started to have seizures and I would have died. If I hadn't been canning...

The apple sauce was delicious.

[bucket](http://i.imgur.com/mU7tcUA.jpg)

I filter the sap with coffee filters in a strainer as I poor it into these two 6qt pans.  Probably not strictly necessary, but there are usually wood chips and stuff that get into the sap (if there's bugs I toss it).  The filters plug up rather quickly too as it usually takes 4 filters to fill 12qts so they're pulling something out even if it looks clear.  After it's boiled for a while, I top off the two pans with the leftover gallon of sap.

[pans](http://i.imgur.com/wmCOz1O.jpg)

I try to ditch the stainless pan early on and combine it all into the cast iron dutch oven because the cast heats so much more evenly.  You get a lot less sugar in the syrup that way.

[dutch oven](http://i.imgur.com/KsRSOlg.jpg)

When you start to get syrup, it starts to foam very quickly.  You'll notice that between 11:38 and 11:42 the burner is off but there was a lot of action going on.   I was continually picking up the dutch oven and sloshing the syrup around into a cloud of steam.  Failure to do that bit ruins an expensive pan and/or starts a fire.  4 gallons takes about 3 and half hours so be prepared to stand there and watch it for the last 30 mintues (at least).

[it's done!](http://i.imgur.com/8N4E5cr.jpg)

Now I let it sit at steam away a bit more moisture with the burner off.  Then I pour it into one of 2 large measuring cups I have so it can settle. 

[1qt cup](http://i.imgur.com/xpxT4Ck.jpg)

After it's settled I poor the top 90-some-percent of it off into jars or dispensers and toss the sugar and ugly bits at the bottom of the measuring cups.

It has been pretty humid which made the glaze drippy and sort of soggy. I decided to dehydrate them to see if it would improve the texture. After 4 hours on 100 degrees or so I really liked the results, after 6 they were even better. I broke some of the donuts into 2 inch pieces to help them dry more and continued to dehydrate them. After 8-12 hours on 160 they were bone dry, but the texture was very delicate, even more delicate than panko.

I used the pieces to make banana pudding and it was probably the best I've ever had. Unlike vanilla wafers, the dehydrated donuts stayed crispy and crunchy, even after 3 days in the fridge under lots of pudding, bananas and whipped cream. If you have a dehydrator I highly recommend this. The next time I see them on sale I'm going to do this again but use smaller pieces in homemade ice cream. I have a feeling they will stay crunchy. They might be good ground up and used as a ""bread crumb"" coating for something sweet.

I've done pickles for a couple years, and I feel like I'm doing a better job selling to the pickle canning crowd. For example, I sell pickles in pecks of 3"", 4"" and sometimes 5"" pickling cucumbers to give the pickles a consistency that helps in the kitchen.  We also sell dill and garlic.

Is this a helpful way to sell pickles?

Also, we sell berries, tomatoes, peppers--the whole show.  What is something about buying these that irks you and you wish your supplier did differently? ",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,,True,t3_1jbhba,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1jbhba/i_run_a_roadside_vegetable_stand_what_can_i_do/,

Here's the answer I got back:

&gt;  Jars are most properly stored without the rings, this prevents rusting of the rings (bands) due to trapped moisture and facilitates seeing when/if lids lift on jars and the jars become unsealed.  Loosening the rings is also OK, but I always find that I need the rings for canning the next day, etc so I simply remove the bands altogether. It is important to wipe the threads and inspect the seal (after the jars have cooled) prior to storage. 

&gt;  The time when the bands should be on jars is when they are transported, i.e. to a farm market, as a gift. This prevents jarring of the seal if jars knock against each other in transport or handling.",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,,True,t3_117u6c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/117u6c/emailed_my_local_extension_office_about_the/,

I've noticed many people posting their canned tomato products and think that is great. When it comes to preserving my tomato crop I find dehydrating and storing them in sterilized quart jars is the most efficient for my time and space constraints.
A couple years ago I bought [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVJ3C/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00) dehydrator and have been really really pleased with its performance, the flavors of different things on different shelves indeed do not mix with this model, I have done green peppers and bananas at the same time with no flavor mixing. It comes with 5 trays (which is enough space to do about 3 gallons of tomatoes in one run) and will dry a full load of stuff in 24-48 hours.

For tomato sauce I will slice up my tomatoes into chunks up to 1/2"" thick, dehydrate them until they are no longer squishy(about 36 hours), toss them into a sealed quart jar to cool(once cooled they get brittle), then run them through a food processor to grind them into powder. A 3 gallon load of tomatoes will condense down to about a half pint to a pint once powdered. For reconstituting into sauce a 1 part tomato to 4 parts water volume ratio is recommended, but I tend to like my sauce a bit thicker, so I usually do a 1:3.5. You could also add your other dried herbs to the powder, in fact it is somewhat recommended as they will keep your powder free flowing longer. Some of my powder at two years old has seized up a bit and must be broken loose, but I have been in and out of the jar a couple dozen times.

For recipes that call for tomato chunks just forgo the powdering step and throw a little extra water in the recipe, I have made some great stews and chilli using dehydrated slices and just letting them re hydrate while cooking.

 You will need:

2 heaping cups of fresh dandelion petals  (see note below-you'll need to gather about 4 cups whole flowers)

2 C boiling water

1/4 C well-strained clear lemon juice

4 C sugar

3 oz liquid pectin (Certo)

food coloring (optional)

NOTE:  Look for fully opened flowers, the bigger the better, for ease of preparation.  Of course do NOT use any dandelions that have been sprayed with fertilizers or pesticides!

We'll want just the dandelion petals for this - not the whole flower head.  You'll get SOME green sepals, and that's fine - but try to minimize the amount of ""green"" and have mainly yellow petals for your infusion.  It works best if you hold the flower by the end near the stem and trim the petals into a bowl or cup, with sharp kitchen scissors.  Your fingers will be turned yellow!  :)

Pour boiling water over petals and let steep from 30 minutes to 24 hours.  About 2 hours will produce a good infusion.  Liquid should be room temperature.  Strain through a fine sieve, reserving the infusion.  If not using immediately, refrigerate for up to 24 hours.

Place jars and lids on rack in pan or stockpot deep enough to cover them with about two inches of water, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, keeping the jars hot until ready to fill.

To make the jelly, stir lemon juice (or lime juice) and sugar into reserved infusion in a two-quart nonreactive or stainless steel pan.  Bring to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down.  Add the liquid pectin and continue to boil two minutes, skimming any foam that may rise to the surface

The natural color will be a golden hue.

Ladle quickly into jars within about 1/8 inch from the top; clean each rim and threads of the jar as it's filled, and place flat lid and ring on each before filling the next.  Screw band on tightly and invert jar on tea towel for about five to ten minutes.  Jars should seal and lids should pop shut within 10 minutes as they cool.  If they do not seal, you can place them in a hot water bath for 10 minutes or place in the refrigerator.

Sealed jars will last up to one year in a cool, dark place.  Put any unsealed jelly in the refrigerator, it should keep about three weeks.  Makes four or five half-pint jars.

1371842465.0,27,self.Canning,1gt9id,My first foray into jam was an absolute DISASTER. Help :(,InspiredByKITTENS,28,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1gt9id/my_first_foray_into_jam_was_an_absolute_disaster/,"Seriously. Things exploded. I literally had no idea what was going on the entire time.

Partly I deserved it because I thought myself so smart as to take on two different jams at the same time. The processing times were the same and the cooking process was the same, so I thought, what's one more pot to stir? I was originally just going to do a blueberry jam because I had too many on hand, but on a trip to the farmer's market I just couldn't pass up the very tail end of strawberry season...

I made the berry jam recipe, no pectin, and the strawberry jam, no pectin recipes, out of the Ball Blue Book (I ruined that book, I'm not sure the pages will turn anymore...). I halved the berry recipe into 4.5 cups of crushed berries and 3 cups of sugar. I also halved the jar size, yield was originally 3 pints (on the full recipe), and I wanted half pints, so I planned for 3 half-pints. I did NOT alter the strawberry recipe, I used 2 quarts (measured uncrushed) strawberries and 6 cups of sugar. All of my research assured that this was all fine... doubling = bad, but halving is OK. 

As I was crushing the blueberries I sensed *something* was amiss... just looking at the berries and looking at the 3 half pints I knew it wasn't going to fit. So I actually washed and sterilized 4 half pints, trusting that some of it would cook down and I probably wouldn't have to use the 4th. I must have checked my math a hundred times.

Everything was fine until I tried to bring them to a boil... they both sat there and did nothing for the longest time, and then, simultaneously, they foamed up and boiled over in the span of like a *minute*. Sticky syrup EVERYWHERE. In my haste to get them off the heat, I made it 10x worse. Under the burners, all over the pot handles, all over me, all over the floor, on the cabinets, on the book.... the final casualty count was pretty impressive, actually.

I was able to find a bigger pot for the blueberry mix, but was maxed out on the strawberry so I just poured a HUGE amount off (~2 pints?), stuck it in the fridge and called it syrup. There was a good 2+ inches of clearance to the rim of my strawberry pot now. Maybe a half-inch on the blueberry. The blueberry caused no further trouble - it actually cooked down really well, quit foaming and started to gel nicely.  The strawberry however... it foamed over at least two more times. It then scorched. It never even pretended to gel, it because slightly less runny but I think it was just because I kept having to pour off the liquid underneath all the floating fruit. 

Since the blueberry was behaving, I went ahead and filled those jars... and found myself, despite having lost a substantial amount to being an idiot, with WAAAAY too much blueberry stuff. I should add here that I was really meticulous with my measurements, and the blueberries were slightly less than 4.5 cups because I ran out. I used all 4 half pints, and then filled almost an entire pint. The strawberry, had I not spilled it everywhere AND poured a large portion out, would probably have been spot-on 3 pints or close to it.

The good news is everything sealed... even the monsterous blueberry-strawberry rejects/bottom of the pots jar that I wasn't too sure about. But I'm just really curious about what the heck happened here. Why was the blueberry so much more than what the recipe said yield was, even when it seems I used even less than called for? Is it normal for recipes from the Ball book to vary so much, or is it a by-product of differing fruit water compositions? Is drowning in foam a normal thing for strawberry jam or did I have the burner too high or something? Did pouring off some of the recipe effect the gelling of my strawberry stuff? How much room at the top of your pot do you leave? Should a beginner just stick with pectin :(?

BTW, I love pickling, I have had several exciting adventures with pickling. Unfortunately, I did not realize just how little I knew about jam until I was knee-deep in it. I know I won't be trying anything jelly-y until I get a fire extinguisher (that was my number one thought when it got all under the burners!!) but if this kind of stuff is par for the course I may just stick with my vinegar...",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,,True,t3_1gt9id,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1gt9id/my_first_foray_into_jam_was_an_absolute_disaster/,

I picked about three quarts of flowers, and separated the yellow from the green- time consuming, and stains your fingers yellow. Then I made a tea by pouring three cups boiling water over the petals, covered them with a towel, and let it steep for about two hours. Strained this and topped it off with a little water to make exactly three cups.

Using the directions for Pomona's pectin, I added 3 TBLS lemon juice and 3 tsp calcium water. Brought that to a boil, then added 2 1/4 tsp pectin powder mixed with one cup sugar. Boiled this for a minute and then ladled it into jars. Processed in a BWB for 15 minutes!

It made exactly three half pints, and enough to smear on a piece of bread. It tastes mild and herby, pretty good! Hope it sets up nicely!

I have ZERO canning experience.  And I have TONS OF MINT.  I have two varieties of nice spicy spearmint, one with flat leaves, and one with curly leaves, and they will be producing a HUGE amount this year.  I could end up canning several cups of mint leaves a week, or more if I keep up on harvesting it.

Mint jelly is the obvious idea that pops out at me, and I'd like to find a good recipe for mint simple syrup or a mojito mix that I can can (the phrase can can sounds funny to me).  Anyways I stumbled upon a ""peach mint salsa"" recipe that sounded good, and it made me wonder what other minty canning recipes might be out there.

I know from lurking here that I shouldn't change ingredients in recipes, and should follow them exactly.  (I'm also under the impression that its a bad idea to double or halve recipes?)  But I'll take any advice you have along with your recipes, if you've tried them and have advice to give.

I just wanted to share a raspberry jalapeño jam recipe I made recently. I'd spent ages searching for a good recipe for this that used primarily honey, wasn't super sweet and had some heat. I finally found a recipe (for blackberries) and adjusted it to have raspberries and jalapeños. What I ended up with was exactly what I was looking for! If you try it, let me know!

4 cups crushed raspberries (this was a half flat from my farmer's market)

2-3 finely chopped jalapeños

1/4 cup sugar

3 T low sugar pectin

1 1/3 cup honey

2 T lemon juice

In large pot crush berries with potato masher. Stir in pectin, sugar and jalapeños. Bring mixture to full rolling boil, stirring constantly. Stir in honey and lemon juice. Boil hard for 4-5 minutes, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and skim off foam with metal spoon.

Ladle hot jam into hot sterilized half-pint jars, leave 1/4 in. headspace. Wipe rims, adjust lids and screw bands. Process jars in boiling-water canner for 10 minutes. Remove and let cool.

This made 6 half-pints.",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,,True,t3_1in8j7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1in8j7/raspberry_jalapeño_jam_recipe/,

* Get fresh prickly mini-cucumbers from your garden, not too ripe (seeds too big, loss of flavor), not too unripe (teensy-weensy pickles make me sad).

* Sterilize canning jars of your choice.

* Put in pot: 10 parts water, 1 part 12% acetic acid (plain white vinegar), 1 part table-salt.

* Add to this pot: juniper berries, mustard seeds, a few whole peppercorns, some bay leaves, a bunch of cloves (whole), and whatever else you encounter in your cabinet or backyard. 

* Stir the pot, then bring to a boil.

* Meanwhile, wash and dry the pickles. Slice them if you like.

* Layer them in the jars with oodles of dill

* Pour the boiling liquid over the pickles, all the way to the top.

* Seal the jars.

* Store in a dark place for a week or two.

* Pickles will stay good for many weeks, especially if refrigerated.

I was like a giddy school girl on Christmas morning when the package came.  Tearing through the tape and newspaper to find YESS!!!  Orange Marmelade and Wild Blueberry Jam!  Score.  I hope my recipient is as excited about what I sent her.

Anyway, If we get a couple dozen people to sign up I think it would be a good time.  If this thread shows enough interest I'll post an email address where people can sign up to participate.

The rules would be simple.  Only jam, jelly, or preserves.  Only items you made, in your kitchen, with your hands, under your supervision.  Ingredients on the label (if you have food allergies, you may want to sit this out).  You mail 2 jars of your choosing to your jam exchange buddy.  They mail 2 jars back to you.  I'll set a deadline for entry, and then a 2 week window in which to ship your box.

Like I said, i had a blast meeting a fellow canner, talking to each other, sharing out blogs, and then sharing our jam.  Drop a line if you'd be interested.

*****EDIT*****:
Okay, We've received about a dozen replies.  I say this is a go.

If you are interested in participating send an email to jamexchange@yahoo.com (can you believe it was still available?)  Include your name, address, and blog (if you want the other person to go look), as well as whether or not you are willing to ship internationally.  The deadline for entry will be September 25th .  So if you belong to any other subs or blogs where you want to promote this, feel free.  I will match up partners between September 26th and October 1st.  Everyone should box and ship their package between October 1st and October 8th.  Please ship your package by October 8th so your jam buddy is left in the dark.  By October 15th we should all be enjoying our bounty!!

*****EDIT #2*****:
I am most wildly entertained by the number of emails I've received that say ""Yes, I want to do this.  How do I sign up?""

Makes 3, 24oz jars.

-5 cups white vinegar

-1 cup water

-4 tablespoons sea salt

-1 tablespoon mustard seed

-1 tablespoon celery seed

-1 tablespoon oregano

-4 cloves garlic, crushed

Put it all into a big pot and boil.

After cleaning and sterilizing the jars, pack the jars full of peppers, carrots and onions. Make sure you poke holes or put slits in the peppers if you want to pickle them whole. You could put some whole garlic cloves in there too if you really like garlic like me :)

Then pour the boiling brine right into the jars.

Then seal, put them in a boiling water bath for about 10 min and that's it!!!

Store them in a cool dark place for a couple months.

Fancy packing is basically when you take time [to cut](http://i.imgur.com/0oz1R.png) and arrange your foods in a pleasing manner before processing. Olives stuffed with pimentos is a great example. Layering potato slices neatly rather than simply throwing them in the jar is another. For fancy packed peppers you might use a multiple colored mix of spears. Maybe place a jalapeno half inside a red bell pepper quarter. For fruit butters some people make multiple layers of contrasting color and complimentary flavors. Of course this takes more effort and more knowledge about canning. You wouldn't want to screw up the ph of your food just to make it look prettier. 

Most state fair judges ignore fancy packing if not openly prohibit it. Economy packing or simple packing seems to be the preference by far. I suppose it makes sense. Competitions are a way to raise awareness about canning and the judges probably don't want it to seem fussy or time consuming. That's practical but I don't see why there can't be a separate category devoted to fancy packing. It can be fun to come up with pretty, interesting, unique presentations. It adds a whole new layer of craftiness to your foods. This is especially nice if you are giving the canned items away as gifts. 

One classic fancy packing technique is for canning pear or apple halves. Cut the center out with a melon baller or round measuring spoon. Cut away the stem area neatly and stuff each opening with a cherry. Place the fruit in a jar with the cherry facing outwards. Alternate with the stem end up and down. Fill the center area of the jar slices and process according to your directions.

I have dozens of jars of pickles.  I wanted something different.

Although this recipe has nothing to do with canning, I didn't know where else to post it.

I ended up slicing my remaining cucumbers in thin slices.  I dipped them in beaten eggs, then breaded them in seasoned bread crumbs.  I pan fried all the slices in canola oil until golden brown.  These little fried cucumber slices were delicious as is, but I went one step further.  Cucumber Parmesan.  I layered the fried cucumber slices in a casserole dish with homemade canned tomato sauce (made with my cherry and grape tomatoes from my garden) and fresh sliced mozzerela cheese.

Baked the whole thing at 375 for 30 minutes.  Tasted fantastic.  It was a great vegetarian meal that (mostly) came from my garden.  If you're up to your ears in cucumbers and tomatoes, try this out.

**Edit:** This was my quick tomato sauce recipe.  I didn't measure anything:

In a casserole dish, pour some olive oil so that there is a thin layer across the whole bottom.  Roughly cut up all your tomatoes and toss them in the casserole dish, slice half an onion and throw that in too.  Liberally crack some fresh salt and pepper all over it.  Mix it all together so it's all coated in the oil.  Splash it all with a little white wine (optional, but alcohol does bring out additional flavors in the tomato).  Bake it at 350 for about an hour.  The tomatoes should start to burst and develop nice charred edges, the onions should be starting to caramelize (if not, bake it longer, or at a higher temp).  Take it out, throw in a handful of fresh basil leaves, about a half dozen smashed cloves of garlic and sprinkle in some crushed red pepper.  Mix it all up again.  Lower the temp to 325.  Bake it for another hour to hour and a half.

Take it out and pour it all in the blender..  Get all the hot liquid in there too.  Blend on high until smooth.  Best fucking gravy ever.

What can I do to stop the bleeding?,RationalUser,19,1,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/xd0yj/my_failure_rate_has_skyrocketed_this_year_what/,"Started canning three years ago, went through my first hundred or so jars with just one failure.  Moved to a new place, but I think the same equipment, and now I'm having a really high failure rate.  Today I canned 18 jars of pickles and had 6 failures.  Two weeks ago it was five out of twenty.  I had been using leftover lids from last summer, but a friend suggested I need to buy new lids.  Tried that this weekend, that obviously didn't work.  I had a higher failure rate last summer too (my first in my new locale), but not more than 5 percent.

The one tangible thing that has changed from my old place to my new is the elevation.  I'm closer to sea level, so I process for less time.  And I'm using a new stove.  Last week I had tried it outside (on a propane burner that was barely hot enough to keep a boil), so I thought maybe that was part of the problem, but this week on the stove things were worse.

So questions:  

Does processing time matter this much?  If I processed for five minutes longer would that make a difference?

How important is the time it takes to recover a boil in the canner?  This stove seems to take longer..does that matter?  I don't start counting processing time until I reach a boil, but it sometimes takes 3-5 minutes to get back to a boil.

Another issue is that I have one of those ""granite"", cheap boilers that is deep enough for pints, but requires constant re-filling for quarts (I refill with boiling water from a kettle), and even with pints I get a lot of spill over.  As a result, during a processing event, there's over an inch of water above the jars at the start, but there will be moments when it falls to less than an inch.  I check every 2minutes or so.

Also, the jars tend to rattle into close proximity.  When I check them I re-situate them so they aren't touching, but of course that means using the ""claw"", not sure if that is messing with them.

Finally, how important is it to remove them perfectly level and place them on a level surface.  I usually put them on a wire rack, which starts to sag after ten or so...my failures aren't only happening after the rack starts to bend, but trying to minimize every source of problems here.

Thanks for whatever help you can provide.

Edit:  Once again, thanks for the assistance.  At minimum, I feel like I learned a few things I might have done wrong, especially related to head-space and the age of my lids.  I'll let everyone know if the next round is a bigger success (probably in 2-3 weeks).",,False,self,t5_2re2w,1343686273.0,,,True,t3_xd0yj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/xd0yj/my_failure_rate_has_skyrocketed_this_year_what/,

**gfpumpkins** [Emailed my local Extension office about the ring/band discussion, here's their answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/117u6c/emailed_my_local_extension_office_about_the/)

&gt;Jars are most properly stored without the rings, this prevents rusting of the rings (bands) due to trapped moisture and facilitates seeing when/if lids lift on jars and the jars become unsealed. Loosening the rings is also OK, but I always find that I need the rings for canning the next day, etc so I simply remove the bands altogether. It is important to wipe the threads and inspect the seal (after the jars have cooled) prior to storage.

&gt;The time when the bands should be on jars is when they are transported, i.e. to a farm market, as a gift. This prevents jarring of the seal if jars knock against each other in transport or handling.

Woke up, boiled water, started french press and grabbed a bowl to feed the cat, same as most mornings. I'd just bought cat food and I get those heat shrink wrapped packages of 4 9Lives cans. I notice before opening the package that one looks like it got bashed. (It did not occur to me, in my coffee-lacking brain, that it looked bulged, hindsight being 20/20 and all). 

I open the shrink wrap to inspect it more closely to see if the seal held when, BANG!, loud enough to ring my ears for a moment, and the half of the kitchen the can was pointing at is covered in rotting, slimey, cat food-esque substance. The can has been dropped, miraculously, I only got a little on my toe, which I quickly washed off. 

So, what now? 

I donned plastic bags over my hands, and a spray bottle full of vinegar, and a roll and a half of paper towells later everything *looks* clean. 

I have my own notion of what I'm doing next, but I want to hear what /r/canning has to think about it. I'm going to go shower within an inch of my life, there's a fan in the window dispersing the stench. 

How would you deal with this? Replace all the appliances and dishware isn't really an option, nor is moving. I can tell you right now 9Lives is off the menu (not the first bad incident I've had with their products).

",Vikaroo,19,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/151ikn/shipped_canned_goods_fingers_crossed/,"Before you read this, skip down to the comments section, per Forensicunit plastic grocery bags and packing paper works great and I'm just a silly newb who totally freaked out and probably overdid it with the packaging. Reddit had once again restored my faith that things will probably turn out Okay.

I'm making this a post because I have some good information for anyone who is planning on shipping canned goods as gifts this season, which is what I just did. My family always bakes, and this year I decided to send them canned goods. I sent a variety of jams, fruits, salsas and such. 

I highly underestimated how many boxes I would need. I ended up with 4 10x10x10 boxes and 4 12X12X9 boxes, plus some boxes I used to double-pack on the inside for extra protection. It worked out to each box being packed with 6-10 jars, a mixture of pints and half pints in each. I bubble wrapped EVERY jar, plus I crumple-paper-padded the top and bottom of the box, and added some bubble wrap and crumbled paper to the sides. I was feeling pretty good about myself, I packaged them all up so that there was no movement in the boxes, and that I thought I had enough padding all the way around and in between, and pre-printed my shipping labels, threw ""fragile"" on all sides just in case that helps (the internet says it doesn't) and dropped them off at FedEx. 

Then I got the bad news. 
Only when I was dropping off my very last box did the employee say ""they must survive a 5 foot drop because of the conveyer belt"". There was nothing I could do at that point to make myself feel better about it, the packages were already gone. 

So here are my tips for anyone in the future. 

1. Buy a larger box (NOT a huge box, the 10x10x10's were 11lbs each) and then 2 smaller boxes that will fit snugly inside without causing the bigger box to rip or bulge. 

2. Buy GOOD bubble wrap, the store brand ""Office Depot"" stuff ended up being the best for me, although half of my boxes were sent with crappy bubble wrap from Target before I realized. The difference is the strength is very obvious, one will mush and the other will stay firm. Also the more expensive stuff stick to itself a little making wrapping easier. 

3. Bubble wrap every single jar individually so that you can feel the squish, but not the jar.

4. Cushion the bottoms, tops, and sides of the ""smaller"" boxes, then fill any extra space with crumpled newspaper, peanuts, or more bubble wrap. You want to have to squeeze those smaller boxes closed to tape them - there should be NO movement once they are taped if you shake them. If there's movement then cram some more stuff in. 

5. Put the smaller boxes into the bigger box. If the fit is not snug, bubble wrap and crumpled paper should be added to any available spaces. Again, you should have a snug fit and there should be absolutely no movement if you shake the box once it's all closed up. 

6. Try not to freak out for the next few days until your packages arrive, wondering if they're safe and sound or not. 

Any other suggestions are welcomed. Hopefully my packages arrive, but if not I'm hoping to safe someone else some pain. 

TL;DR:
Packages shipped through FedEx must be able to survive a 5 foot drop on the conveyer belt. This post may help you avoid sadness and loss of delicious canned goods.

Hi, I'm new to canning and just made my first strawberry jam.  I went by the recipe that came with my pectin (sure-jell for less or no sugar, low sugar recipe), cooked and jarred it up, and processed the jars in a water bath.  Immediately the fruit pulp started floating to the top.  There are a lot of tiny air bubbles trapped in there too.

Is it possible that I didn't crush the berries well enough?  Is it normal for this to happen?  Will it affect shelf life?

I dug through all of the FAQs on the sidebar and the only place I saw floating fruit mentioned was on pickyourown* in the [canning QA](http://www.pickyourown.org/canningqa.htm#Fruits_) section, where it's made to sound like a kind of failure state.

Is anyone able to give me some enlightenment about whether I screwed up?  The jam is delicious, but I need to know whether it all needs to be kept in the fridge or gobbled up quickly.

I'm starting my next venture in food and cooking - canning. I bought a Presto 16 - quart canner and since I have zero experience with all this I don't know if the canner I got is defective or not. I'm wondering if any here would lend me a little of their experience.

I emailed Presto support and we had a couple messages back and forth but they haven't answered my question whether this is normal or if my unit has troubles. One reply kind of said it's normal and the other kinda said it isn't. No matter. I made a couple videos of the problem to mail to them and thought I would ask here as well.


The problem is this...

The canner hisses steam all the time from the vent with the weight on it. So far I have tested it only a few times with water but each time the results were the same. It hissed continuously while the pressure raised, and while maintaining a pressure. I tried to keep it at 11lbs for 30 minutes and at 15lbs. Because the heat is med-high to raise the pressure it does vent aggressively when it reaches 15lbs but slows to a hiss if you let it cook at 14lbs.

I have put the videos on youtube if any are interested in seeing the problem. The first is the pressure rising and the second is at 11lbs for about 10 minutes.

canner 1 - http://youtu.be/voaHGkB_0Hk
canner 2 - http://youtu.be/t873q5HQa4o


Does anyone here have an experienced opinion? Is it normal / ok? Or is it defective? If it is ok, is there a risk of steaming off all of the cooking water over lets say a hundred minutes?

Thanks!

I watched the gauge sputter about 2 or 3 times per minute and tried not to fuss with the stove dial too much. I waited the 10 or so minutes after the pressure reached zero before opening the canner.

My question is this: when I opened the canner, I could clearly smell fish, and see tiny fishy particles clouding the water. All my cans pinged tightly, and this morning I removed all the rings and checked each one individually to find the leaked one but all of them are sealed with about level contents. Is it normal to find some contents in the canner? It is an oily fish, so I am worried they are not really sealed, if any oil leaked under the seal.... advice? is this normal and I should calm down? should I just watch the jars carefully over the next few weeks?

I am not going to be looking for a pressure canner for a while, as I want to make sure the water bath canning is something I like, and I want to test out recipes that I can make with that before I invest a bit more money into a pressure canner.  
Are there other things I should get? Tips that you wish you knew from the begining?  
I just made my first recipe last night, quick pickles from the ball book, and am waiting to see if my processing worked.  It said to wait 24 hours to make sure the center pops in.  I checked them this morning, and it looks like they are flat, but not popped in yet. Does it really take the 24 hours to be concave or is the recipe being conservative?

What other things were a ""hit"" with your household, that you made using a water canner?  At this point, I'm trying it out, and I don't mind buying produce at a premium.  I figure when I have it down, Ill start looking at getting items in a more bulk amount.

  New to canning and I've got a question. I know what I didn't isn't REALLY canning, but I'm not sure. So I made a ton of soup. Chicken soup with rice and stuff. Anyway, I didn't have a Tupperware for it, so I figured, why not drop them in a mason jar and pop them in the fridge.

So I pulled out some mason jars and put the hot soup in the jars, and closed them up. Not really meaning to ""can"" them, just store them in the fridge. Anyway, a bit later, I went to grab something, when I noticed all the tops had been pulled in.  

My question is, are they canned properly to be shelf stable? I wasn't planning on keeping them anywhere other than the fridge, but I wasn't sure what the deal was.

Thanks!


**UPDATE**

Thanks for the feedback everyone. I figured I'd probably kick the bucket had I put it in the pantry, that's why I put it all in the fridge. So if I plan on doing any meat based canning in the future, I need to invest in a vacuum canner.

**tl;dr: I have a ton of habaneros and jalapenos and am looking for ideas of what do with them. I have a big freezer and no experience canning.** 

Hey /r/canning,  


I had some pretty good luck with my habanero and jalapeno pepper plants this year. I have more peppers than I know what to do with! I have 65 habaneros (and more growing) and probably twice as many jalapenos (I didn't count those). Last year I made one batch of habanero hot sauce and it lasted me through the year until I had fresh ones again. That only used about 10 peppers. I have enough to make at least 5 batches of the stuff, which I'm not really interested in doing. Another idea I had was hot pepper jelly. If I make both of those, it uses about 1/3 of the peppers. What else can I do with them?
For the jalapenos, I was thinking of slicing and pickling them. I have no experience canning, nor do I have equipment, so I'd like to find a way to freeze them. (I might be willing to try canning if someone can make it sound easy and botulism-free). What about making chipotles en adobo? Does anyone have experience with that? I have a charcoal grill, but not a smoker. Any other ideas?
I also have my fiance's food dehydrator, but I don't know what do with dehydrated peppers besides making crushed pepper as a topping, which I don't do too often anyway.  

P.S. If you have good recipes for habanero hot sauce or hot pepper jelly I'll take them. I don't have anything planned yet.",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,,True,t3_10ogko,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/10ogko/looking_for_ideas_for_habaneros_and_jalapenos/,

It is the kind with the weight on the lid that is supposed to ""jiggle"" when it gets to the correct pressure for whatever weight you use. We are currently doing a dry run to get a feel for the canner and are concerned. 

The instructions claim it will get to pressure and the weight will ""jiggle"" to release steam and maintain the pressure. When they say ""jiggle"", what exactly does that mean? We are getting about 2 bursts per minute and the bursts last 10-15 seconds, releasing quite a bit of steam. The instructions said 2 quarts of water but with the amount of steam it's giving off, I have my doubts that it will be enough to sustain a 90 minutes of processing.

Is this right? If something seems wrong, what and how do we fix it? 

Here's a video of what it was doing: http://youtu.be/3dWfbql5Akc

However, after reading more about canning I have some concerns about its safety.

The recipe in question is for a spaghetti sauce. It begins with frying some vegetables (including garlic) in vegetable oil in a dutch oven, then adding some meat and browning it. Then all the rest of the ingredients (diced tomatos, tomato paste, mushrooms, spices, etc) are added and the sauce is covered and put in the oven for 3 hours at 300F. Then the oven is turned off and sauce is put on the stove to reduce for a bit.

Then all the canning jars are cleaned, dried, and put into the oven, this time set for 400F. After the jars have been at 400F for 10 minutes, they're taken out to cool a bit before canning (to avoid thermal shock of the glass). Then I stick the lids into boiling water for a minute and pour the sauce into the jars, wiping down the rims if necessary before putting the lids on. Then I screw the rings on and wait for the lids to pop. That's it.

Specifically, I've read about some recipes needing additional acid to kill any microbes, and the need to pressure can the jars when garlic is present (to kill botulism spores). Even if I had used acid and didn't have any garlic, wouldn't I still have to at least process the jars in a water bath for safety?

While I don't think her parents have had any issues with their method, a smell test or looking for visible mold still wouldn't uncover dangerous levels of botulism, right?",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,,True,t3_1if7vm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/1if7vm/beginner_here_is_my_method_unsafe/,

I've been pickling and preserving for a bit over a year now and I've really great results. This past month my husband I decided to get a pressure canner so we could preserve fish that he gets from his job at the local green market as well as some low acid foods. Our first foray into pressure canning we did tuna, which worked really great.

Yesterday I did the NCHP's pressure canner chili and hit a few snags. The first one was simply in the recipe. I followed it to the letter and found my chili to be REALLY dry. Like, barely any tomatoes dry. I figured that since I had used home preserved tomatoes that were loosely packed and I didn't use a buttload of water that I'd add an extra quart of tomatoes that I pulsed in the immersion blender and added half a quart of water, because it was really too try to match up to any photos I had seen of other people's pressure canner chili.

I didn't drain my meat because we used very little fat to brown it and it simply didn't have any excess oil to mine or my husband's eyes(we did throw it in a collander for a quick second but it didn't seem to give off any oil). Anyway, so everything was fine and when we pulled out our pints after processing, a total of 4 jars didn't seal, and quite a bit of moisture had left the jars. So here are my questions.

1)Should I worry about the lack of liquid in my jars? I mean, there is liquid there, but it is relatively dry. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/BZRrM) is a photo of a few jars.

2)Any ideas why so many of my jars didn't seal? I thought it might have been oil seeping out of the jars and interfering with the seal, but I packed my tuna in olive oil and they all sealed just fine. Any tips and tricks that you fine ladies and gentlemen have discovered?

My grandmother has an entire basement full of canning jars of various sizes, more than any one person could ever use.  This past spring, I began to renew my interest in canning, so she gave me a bunch of jars a various sizes.

Along with your usual jelly, cup, pint, and quart jars, she also gave me some half gallon and gallon sized jars.  I understand that these jars are not considered safe for canning anything except very acidic juices like grape juice (and I think that might only be for the 1/2 gallon, I'm not sure).  Besides, I don't have a pot large enough to fit these jars, so it is impossible for me to process them at all.

I know that she used these jars for open-kettle canning grape juice.  I'm not sure if she used them for anything else.  I also know that open-kettle canning is generally considered to be unsafe, but she's my grandmother, and like many people her age, she doesn't always follow the newer canning guidelines.  She's been canning every year for a very long time, starting when she was helping her mother and sisters can at the age of 6, so I'm not going to correct her.

Does anyone here know of any uses for jars this size?  I know that botulism can't grow in highly acidic environments like a jar of grape juice, so is grape juice actually a safer exception to the ""no open-kettle canning"" rule?  Are there other food related uses for these jars?

Obviously I could just use them for general storage or something like that, but I'm specifically wondering a food preservation uses, whether canning or otherwise.  I'm sort of just curious at this point.

My question is, how long would it likely take botulism to form in the jar? At this point, the jars have been sealed for less than 24 hours. Can I simply open the jars to break the seal to allow air in, and safely store in my refrigerator? This jam will certainly be consumed within a month (no need for BWB canning/storage anyways), which is safe for non-BWB processed bacon jam.

http://imgur.com/a/EvSFR For some of the pictures I took along the way.

A local store was running a special $29.80 for a 20 lbs package of frozen chicken (1.49/lbs). We enjoy cooking with canned chicken, and were starting to run low, so I bought 3 boxes.  

Comparable at the grocery store was 3.79 for 3/4 of a lbs in a can, or according to [here](http://www.pinchingyourpennies.com/forums/showthread.php?t=89211), costco sells them for 1.66 for 3/4 of a lbs. 

I got a bunch of empty jars when I bought my last house (they were in the attic), so I only needed to buy more lids (0.20 per lid).  If I didn't have the jars, you can buy them new with one lid for $0.79 each, or you can sometimes find them for $0.25 on craigslist.  I think you can reuse them indefinitely.  

I like to cut the chicken into about one inch cubes, and I like to do this when they are about half frozen.  I use a nice heavy knife if they are partially frozen, or a filet knife if they are thawed completely.  

My pressure cooker can hold 14 quarts so I did it in two batches.  This sale was of chicken breast filets, which I prefer for canning over the normal breasts.  Filets seem to be trimmed better, and since they are flattened out, they cut into more uniform cubes.  Notice one picture of the fat pieces in the corner of the [cutting board,](http://i.imgur.com/vH1dph.jpg) these are the only pieces cut off for the first batch.  You don't want to can fatty things, since I think it can make it so it doesn't seal well.

Our dishwasher is broken, so I boiled the bottles to sterilize them.  

Filled them to a little more than an inch from the top, used a butter knife to get the bubbles out, and added a teaspoon of salt.  I counted out the lids, boiled them while cleaning off the rims, and then put them in the pressure cooker.

The pressure cooker is too big for our glass top stove, so we heat it outside on a turkey fryer type burner.  Once it gets to pressure, 15 lbs, since we are more than 1,000 feet above sea level, we set the clock for 90 minutes.  I like to just turn off the burner and let it cool down really slowly, generally I do this late at night, so I just go to bed after I turn off the burner.

After doing 28 quarts I had a couple pounds of cubed chicken left over for dinner the next night.  

Here they are on the shelf.  There's some canned beef there, using the same process, and some quarts of honey (no processing at all there)",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,,True,t3_11kxon,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/11kxon/chicken_breast_xpost_from_rfrugal/,

The recipe I followed can be found [here](http://mulberryjellytheeasyway.blogspot.com/).

All three times the jelly has refused to set properly and turns out more like a syrup, the only deviation I have from the Recipe is using Sure-Jell 100% fruit pectin (powder) instead of Certo.

From experimenting last year, it seems if I take the failed jelly and boil it back down again losing enough liquid to make 4 jars fit into 3 the jelly will set once it has cooled.

I will note that the recipe says it should make 12 jars (.5 cup jars) but when I've followed it I easily get 16-17 of those jars.

To summarize the steps I take:

* mush berries into 4 cups of juice
* put juice in pot
* boil jars / lids 
* add package of pectin ([this stuff] (http://www.frugallivingnw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/sure-jell-pectin1.jpg)) and 1/3 cup sugar to juice and disolve, and lemon juice
* turn to High heat until it boils
* add remaining sugar (about 4 cups) and stir until disolved
* return to boil and allow to boil for 1 minute
* remove from heat
* take out jars and fill w/ jelly, place lid on and secure with ring
* let cool 24 hours.

I'm hoping someone can see what I've done wrong here or point me to a better / more reliable recipe for making Mulberry Jelly.

I was left with a 50% success rate on jars that sealed and those that didn't. Our recipe was 2 parts pear, 1 part sugar, 1 part water, 1/4 part lemon juice. Boil until temp reaches 120, the gel stage. It took over 3 hours.  My questions are



1) We didn't use Pectin. We boiled it down until the temperature reached 120F as recommended by the Ball Book. This morning the the jam looked semi-loose, it slides around when tilted. I was expecting it to be set firmly in place. Is normal with non-pectin jam?



2) We boiled the jars for 10 minutes - BUT - they came down to room temp before we had the chance to fill them. Is this why half our jars didn't seal? We did put the unsealed jars in the fridge this morning. Should I be concerned with safety since the jars had cooled by the time we filled them?


3) We didn't boil the filled jars as recommended by the Ball book. My wife's parents say they've been canning for ""100 years"" and never once boiled the jars after filling. How safe is this with high sugar jams?


4) As for a big pot to process your jars. Are you better off with a relatively cheaper (~$50) thin metal pot made for canning or a more expensive heavy duty general purpose stock pot? One that may have a thick disk bottom or tri-plan design?



****EDIT- I tried the jam when I got home from work today with a slice of toasted homemade French oven bread. This is hands down the best jam I've ever tasted!

Obviously the lids will pop if they're left unopened and there's more mold in other jars, but I'm concerned about giving away jam and stuff for christmas now that this has happened. Looking for some advice.

I used the pickled rhubarb recipe that was posted a few days ago.  I put my cans in the water bath to boil, put my lids in another pot to simmer, and then started getting my ingredients together.  So far, so good.  I boiled my ingredients, then took the jars out of the canner, put the rhubarb in, and poured the liquid in over top.  I poured liquid into the first one, leaving about 1/2"" headspace, as I had found in similar recipes.  However, when it came time to pour into the second jar, I only had enough liquid to fill to about 1.5-2"" from the top.  I wasn't thinking about it, and put the jars back into the water bath and let them boil for 10 minutes.  

My question is, other than probably being lucky it hasn't exploded, will it be safe?  If not, can I still store it in the fridge and use right away, or is it total garbage?  (This is assuming they seal - I just took them out of the water bath about 15 minutes ago.)

Thanks!

edit:  Another question that occurred to me while I was working today:  Is it possible to process something for too long?  Say a recipe calls for 10 minutes of processing, but for whatever reason, a person isn't able to get back until 15 or 20 minutes have passed, or a recipe doesn't say so you have to make an educated guess.

My grandmother canned extensively, and we have cans of greenbeans, tomatoes, and grape juice that are from 06 and are still good, but all the recipes I find for canning say stuff with keep for six months or so, and recommend refrigeration even if they are sealed and processed in a hot bath.

I love seeing all the wonderful things everyone here has canned. And it's a ridiculous amount of info! However, I do have some questions that my searching on here couldn't find answers to ...

I'm taking my first little foray into canning some jams and jellies, and even some meat to be sending out for Christmas presents. I've read quite a bit on here, but something I wasn't 100% sure about was what frozen fruit would be best used for. 

1) We have a lot of berries growing on our property, and since we don't use them often we washed and froze quite a bit of them. Are they safe to use for jam? Is there something else that would be more appropriate to use them for? We also froze some ripe persimmons and pears. We have quite a few pears and I was hoping to make wine, but I don't think I'll have time to find a wine press. Can frozen pears be used for pear butter?

2) As for meat, if anyone has any recommendations for canning rabbit I'd love to hear it! The only thing I have so far is instructions from the National Center for Home Food Preservation, but I'm looking for some ways I might be able to dress it up a bit in terms of flavor. They're our farm-raised rabbits and taste darn good on their own, but I hear that raw packing can make it a bit bland. Should I use some chicken broth and hot pack it?

3) Lastly (and I admit, I didn't search for this) we're making use of the buckets of pecans we have and I wanted to make and send up some pecan butter. I do remember reading that it was hard to ""preserve"" nut butters, but I want to make sure that the bit I remember reading was right. In terms of just food safety, do you think that shipping freshly made pecan butter would be safe?

I'm really excited about doing this, especially canning meat! We have so much we produce but most of my family lives pretty far away, so this is as close as I can get to sharing it with them. 

Also, if anyone has any shipping tips that would be much appreciated as well! Thanks!

For my first ever canned tomato sauce I plan on doing the Basil-Garlic Pasta Sauce recipe from the Ball website and I have a couple of questions. (Recipe here http://www.freshpreserving.com/recipe.aspx?r=45)

1. I'd like to leave the seeds in, both for ease and because I have read it will add a lot of flavour. Will this cause any problems with the pH?

2. I'm thinking about leaving the skin in too. The recipe calls for straining to remove the peel, but that sounds like more work to me than peeling. If it is only a problem of texture/mouthfeel, wouldn't peeling be easier than straining

3. I'd like to add some fresh oregano. Would it be safe to either a) add 1/4 cup of fresh minced oregano to the recipe, or b) replace half the basil with oregano?",,False,self,t5_2re2w,False,,,True,t3_zqvnm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Canning/comments/zqvnm/questions_about_pasta_sauce_recipe/,

First, pictures!  All laid out, here they are: [Left](http://imgur.com/z0asr) and [Right](http://imgur.com/BHe4S) (They wouldn't all fit in one nice picture).

From left to right, here are the flavors and my thoughts on each:

1. Peach Basil Jalapeño
 - The basil really brings a good savory flavor to this, and the jalapeño (as always) gives some good heat to the jam.
1. Blueberry Peach
 - Good flavor combo, not much else to say.
1. Peach Ginger
 - Ginger goes really well with peach.  Man oh man.
1. Strawberry Blueberry
 - I thought this would just be like any other jam, but it is so much better.
1. Strawberry Balsamic Black Pepper
 - My wife an I have no words for how good this is.  It is fairly well known that balsamic vinegar brings out a lot of the flavor in strawberries, but we also threw in about a teaspoon (we went by taste) of freshly ground black pepper right after taking the jam off the stove but before ladling into jars.  It's hard to say why it works, or even if I'd know the pepper was there if I hadn't put it in myself, but it is amazing.
1. Blueberry Ginger
 - Ginger seems to kind of bring out the flavor of blueberry the way that balsamic brings out the flavor of strawberry.  We did run out of fresh ginger by the time we got to this, so we used candied ginger pieces and ginger sugar leftover from making candied ginger.
1. Strawberry Jalapeño
 - Love the heat that the jalapeño adds.  I deseed them before chopping and adding to the mix.
1. Strawberry Balsamic (behind the Strawberry Jalapeño)
 - Good combo, but not quite as good as with black pepper.  We used [this recipe](http://www.freshpreserving.com/recipe.aspx?r=265).
1. Blueberry Jalapeño
 - Same as my comment for the Strawberry Jalapeño.

For recipes, we pretty much solely used the quantity amounts provided by the pectin containers.  For the jalapeño jams, we used about 2 peppers per two pint batch, and reduced the amount of fruit accordingly.  When balsamic vinegar was used, it replaced most of the lemon juice.  The ginger and basil didn't add enough volume for us to really care.

The only snag I really hit was that some of my Peach Basil Jalapeño and Peach Ginger jams didn't set.  To my credit, I was experimenting with different kinds and brands of pectin.  The winner (in my eyes) by the way?  Ball brand powdered pectin.

I also took this opportunity to play around with putting butter into my mix to reduce foaming.  I've always shied away from the idea because the notion of putting butter into my jam seems weird, even though putting jam on buttered toast does not.  But this time around I did a couple of test batches with and without butter, and while I didn't notice a whole lot of difference in total foaming (could have been the pectin I was using), there was a huge difference.  Let me show you:  [With and without butter](http://imgur.com/VUyhk).  The strawberry balsamic on the left, made with a small pat of butter, has little to no bubbling and looks far clearer than the same recipe on the right without butter.

Overall, this was a good experience builder for flavor combinations and jam-making.

1. I am using a glass jar like this, with no gasket and not closing the lid all the way: [Picture](http://images.crateandbarrel.com/is/image/Crate/FidoJarWClampLid5LiterOT9?$web_zoom$&amp;extend=110,110,110,110)   - I read something that said I should keep it in the dark since it isn't opaque like the crock or plastic tub methods. Is this true/necessary?
 
2. Since it IS in glass, I can see bubbles along the sides. When I mashed it in, I mashed it good and hard and didn't see bubbles in the first hours after placing it in the jar. It seems early for these to be bubbles from the bacteria doing their work. Is it possible that's what I'm seeing or do you think that those are bubbles from air I missed working it's way out? Should I try to help the bubbles escape or leave them alone? They are relatively small, the biggest being the size of a small pebble.

3. I'm using the water-bag method of weighting the kraut down. Because the bag is not a uniform shape on the top, I am curious about how to remove scum when I get it. Should I just pull the whole bag out and do my best to remove everything and replace it with a new bag? Or leave the bag in place and do my best to remove the scum around it?

4. My cabbage had a really low moisture level to begin with, so I added more brine on top after mashing it into the jar. Is that okay to do? I hope so!!! I added about a cup of brine.

I haven't been canning very long but I am enthusiastic and have a quick question for all you veterans.

I am in the process of making long fermented kosher dill pickles. I put my pickles in with the brine about 7 days ago. From what I understood, they should have started bubbling around 2 or 3 days in. Now, being a homebrewer I know that fermentation can work on it's own clock so I just kind of figured it might be getting a slow start and gave it some more time. Looking now, though, it doesn't seem like it'll ever start fermenting and now I am considering alternatives to salvage these cucumbers. Can I compensate by adding more vinegar to can and process them through a water bath as usual? Are these cucumbers just not destined to be pickles?

Any information you guys could give me would be appreciated. I would rather not throw out perfectly good cucumbers and if I can work my way to another solution I'd much rather that.

* Single-family detached homes are the most common dwelling, and many if not most such homes have at least fruit trees, so canning is a very common practice. Many traditional and commonly eaten foods also include canned vegetables, fish or meats.

* They would not know what to do with a mason jar if they ever saw one.

* Preservation methods are typically natural preservatives (salt, sugar, vinegar) or more unorthodox things (lye, alcohol, activating the enzymes of the foodstuff...).

* The weird things are their canning methods: Boil some fruit with sugar (typically much less sweet than an American jam), put it in a jar that looks clean, screw on lid, put on shelf, consume over the course of a year. Boil the fruit to a syrup, put through a sieve into a bottle, screw on cap, reconstitute a tablespoon in a glass of water as a beverage, lasts for years. Take some raw fish and/or vegetables, put it in a jar that looks clean together with some water, vinegar and a pinch of sugar, add salt to taste, eat over the course of several months. Take out some of that fish, put in another jar with some creamy mustard or garlic sauce, will keep for months while eating from it until eaten up. And so on and so on...

* Since the late 1960's there has been 11 cases of botulism in Sweden, 4 of them were from canned foods.

Now I really want to get into canning myself, but I find it hard to commit to buying and using special jars with two piece lids and tongs and a huge pot or pressure cooker, when those smug fuckers are being so nonchalant with their canning. And getting away with it!

I've been making refrigerator pickles and canning them myself for about 2 years now.  I use a simple recipe; water, vinegar, salt, spices.  

I'll bring them into work and to some social functions and usually get requests for them.  I've gone to local farmers markets and noticed a lack of pickles in general so I got the idea to possibly start selling them.  

My biggest concern is safety though, both for the customers health and my own legal reasons related to their health.

As of now my canning methods are to boil the jars to sterilize them, wash them out by hand, load them up with the veggies to be pickled and pour the boiling brine over top before sealing them.  I have yet to have a bad seal with this method and the pickles stay nice and crisp until they are gone.

Obviously, if I do venture this route I'd buy a canner to both streamline the process and help ensure a quality seal.  Along with venturing into more recipes.

The biggest question is for selling them, how long should a batch of pickles with such simple ingredients be good for?  I've heard everything from a few months to indefinitely as long as not opened.

I wanted to see if there was any dangers to doing this or if anyone had any recommendations.

The process will be as follows: 2 duck breasts and 4 duck thighs will be placed into 2 (or 3 depending on size) sterilized mason jars. I will then render a couple of pounds of duck fat (with possibly a little bacon fat in there too) and pour that over the duck. Then I'll put the lids on the cans and put them in a water bath to seal, boiling for 10 minutes. My plan is to leave these in the refrigerator for a week or so. After a week in the fridge I'll reboil the cans to liquefy the fat again, removed the duck, de-bone the thighs and then proceed with the rest of the rillette process. 

Any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated. I've never canned meat before, and although I will be cooking it after I've canned it for a week I am still a bit nervous about what pitfalls I could unknowingly stumble into.

Thanks. 

Edit: First of all thank you for all of the responses, I though no one would see this post. After reading the comments it has become clear that actually sealing the cans in a water bath is unnecessary and possibly unhealthy/dangerous.

    At any rate, I am trying to figure out if I can doctor the second recipe to gel properly w/o adding any additional sugar. I used 1.75 oz. of pectin as it's called for in the recipe but wonder if I should add more pectin next time? Would that help?

I looked pectin up on wikipedia, and apparently disolved pectin binds with the sugar and water molecules in filaments, making jelly. Will heating the thing up beak the bound and make it liquid again so we can cut it, or will it evaporate the water and make a pectin-sugar cement ?

The pectin I picked out, Sure Jell, requires 7 cups of sugar but my recipe only calls for 5 1/2. I don't know if this is intentional, ie if the recipe is intending a soft set, or if I should use Pomona low sugar pectin instead. The recipe is vague about what kind of pectin is required. I'm assuming it is meant to be a soft set but would like any advice you guys have. 

Thanks.  

[PINEAPPLE HABANERO JAM](http://www.food.com/recipe/pineapple-habanero-jelly-441782#ixzz1ncUO5xb4)

* 15 habaneros, seeded and deveined
* 1 orange bell pepper (or a bell pepper the same color as the habs)
* 4 cups cubed pineapple
* 1 cup vinegar
* 5 cups sugar
* Pectin
* pinch of salt

Directions:

 In Blender or Food Processor combine Habaneros, Bell Pepper, Pineapple and Vinegar, chop fine.

Bring to a boil on Medium/High heat, boil for 10 minutes, stirring constanly.
 
Add Fruit Pectin, stir until dissolved.

Add Sugar, stir until dissolved.
 
Return to a boil and hard boil for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, mixture will thicken as it boils.

 Remove from Heat and Skim Foam.
 
 Ladle into sterilized 4oz Jars leaving 1/8"" head space.

 Seal and process in boiling water bath for 5 minutes.

 I typically yield 12-14 of the 4 oz jars. May take 1 to 2 days for the jelly to set.

**edit:** Thanks for the response everyone. I went ahead and followed solarmama's advice that if they didn't specify low sugar pectin to use the Sure Jell. I don't know if the stuff will set hard because I increased the vinegar by 1/2 cup. I wanted to be safe because the red pepper I used was pretty large and I wanted to add a garlic clove. I know, I know I shouldn't adjust recipes, but I couldn't resist. I figured 1 1/2 cups of vinegar would be enough to cover my ass. I cooked it down for 13 minutes before adding the pectin and sugar. Hopefully that cooked enough water out to help it set.  

I kept the seeds and stems from 4 of the peppers as well. From tasting a bit of the jelly that was left over the heat is pleasantly intense but short lived. I think next time I will only keep the seeds/veins from 2 though. I really recommend this if you like pepper jellies. It's very fruity and the color is just beautiful thanks to the red pepper. The texture right now is sort of like apple butter so I'm hoping it will set up ok, if not I will just chill it before using. Here are some pics.

Second after adding the bulk of the sugar the jam essentially boiled over which led to lots of foam and a mess in the sink.

2 ½ cups chopped onion

1 ½ cups chopped green pepper

3 – 5 chopped jalapenos

6 cloves minced garlic

2 tsp cumin

2 tsp pepper

1/8 cup canning salt

¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro

1/3 cup sugar

1/3 cup vinegar

16 oz. tomato sauce

16 oz tomato paste

Mix all ingredients, bring to a boil, boil 10 minutes. Pour into hot jars, process at 10 lbs of pressure for 30 minutes for pints.

To process this with a Hot Water Bath increase the vinegar to 1 cup and process for 15 minutes for pints and 20 minutes for quarts.

The recipe is 4lbs Strawberries, 1/4C lime zest (about 4 key limes using a micro plane), and 2T lime juice (the juice of the aforementioned key limes), 1 box pectin, and 8C of sugar. The rest is the standard jam process.

My daughter also wanted me to buy a papaya to try. After tasting it, I decided to make it into a jam. The recipe was 5 cups mushed papaya, 1/2C orange juice, 1 box pectin, and 5C sugar. It turned out ok. Not bad, not amazing. Papaya is an interesting flavor.

I have several lbs of strawberries left. I was thinking Strawberry Cinnamon, or Cardamon, or Clove? I also have about 5 bourbon vanilla beans. That could be good, right?

Do you have any unique jam recipes? I'm not looking for freakishly in left field, but maybe an M Night Shamalan twist? A spice you wouldn't expect? Or a fruit combination that was out of this world?

I just finished canning some blackberries and some peach salsa.  When I was done with the blackberries, I had a quart of leftover light syrup.  I don't have anything to use it for now, but I anticipate canning some more fruit later this year, so I'd like to save it.

After I finished canning the blackberries, I loaded up the canner with my peach salsa, and there was extra room.  So, I filled a quart jar with my leftover syrup and processed it for 35 minutes along with my peach salsa.

Does anyone here know if this will be self stable?  I'd like to keep it until next time I have fruit to can.  It's only sugar and tap water, so it seems to me like it should be okay.  I thought that fermentation would be the worst case scenario here but that processing it for so long would probably prevent that.  However, I wasn't sure so I thought I'd ask.  The only other options that I can think of would be to put it in the refrigerator or to just throw it away, but it would be nice if I could just stick it in the pantry and forget about it until I need it.

Thanks,
