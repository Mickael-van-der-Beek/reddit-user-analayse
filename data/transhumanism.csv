(I may be one of the more extreme of these, being, frankly, disgusted by the feel of my skin against itself.) **However, I've become curious as to whether anyone else feels limited with living in only one body.**

A short paragraph of background: I've always had an interest in multiplying my potential output externally, with servant machines and artificial aids. I've also been interested with increasing my output internally, with memetic structures, education, and monk-like mind-over-matter. However, these effort-enhancers feel like they're **just a workaround**. What I really want is the potential to inhabit multiple, artificial bodies at once (the artificial qualifier being important in order to emphasise the point that I'm not taking anyone else's rights from them, merely expanding my own presence), as well as an increased ability and speed of cognition.

What I'm suggesting is that the brain, and also the mind, is just another body part. Just like with any other body part, it can be improved - and expanded. Although my current brain is hardwired to work with only one body, it could become a reality that I can move several arms and focus on several tasks - multithread myself - just as easily as I currently understand moving one.

*The limitation of a singular perspective is a part of the human condition.* It can be bypassed through transhumanism.

Does anyone else have a ""transhuman"" ideal of the body *and* the mind, or is that a fascination that only I seem to have?",,False,self,t5_2qlii,False,,,True,t3_x2w28,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/x2w28/dae_want_to_expand_their_mind_as_with_their_body/,

I'm hoping to put together a project that addresses this need and I'm calling it &gt;TERMINAL. You can check us out here: http://terminalzine.us

I'm looking for bold artists whose work explores the changing relationship between man and machine. This doesn't necessarily mean every submission is transhumanist but I believe that our every day lives are being radically redefined by technology and art that examines that is becoming more and more powerful.

I hope this is something you guys might be interested in reading or submitting too or just sharing with people who might be. As it stands now our first release will at least be a free PDF, and ePub with homes of a multimedia edition too. I'd like to capture artists reading their work or even more potentially supplementary things.

Only the technological. I know not if this is and underestimate of the genetic code that rises from the many thousands of compromises in our DNA which is understandable. We are blind. We are deaf. We have no sense of smell taste or touch. We are weak. Or if this is brought about from the ever present short sightedness of the all too human self preservation instinct. Either one is understandable however unacceptable. Technology should be at best a secondary objective to fix problems in the intended biology. Inorganic machines unlike organic machine can be fixed easily. They do however fall short in the durability of the organic machine. The organic machine also has a much more powerful processer that does need to be aided in efficiency by its more primitive inorganic counterparts. Even with the limited knowledge of today we could create humans that have the following advancement within 10 maybe 20 years for the advancements we don't have the codes for yet. This of course only possible if someone actually gets the funding to attempt it.

* bones nearly unbreakable and far stronger than steel of the same thickness(already naturally found in a single family of humans. Occurred last generation. Mutation dominant.)

* skeletal muscles with twice as many cells as a normal human's and more endurance than those of a bodybuilder's.(already naturally found in humans. Occurred this generation. Only one know subject. Mutation dominant.)

* inability to get any cholesterol or food related heart disease. Plac build up impossible.( already naturally found in humans. Occurred a few generations back. Currently more than 70 subjects.)

* antifreeze in the blood. High risistance to cold temperatures.(genetic code known.)

* an internal defibulator made of a store of fat cells above the heart instinctively shocking the heart back to life in the event of it stopping, and the ability to survive being frozen solid. Both found in the same animal. A frog no less. The former exists because of the latter.(code unknown could be found out.)

* symbiotic algae that cluster around the mitocondria and are passed on through gametes. This occurs in a single species of lizards and would take awhile to decode but the possibility is still there. 
 
* the ability to see in twelve primary colors. Occurs in a single species of shrimp the genetic code is unknown.

(This is the end of the summary there is far more that can be done at this point of time but this should get the message across.)
 
These are examples of the possibilities of today's limited understanding. After an higher understanding of DNA is astablished far greater feats of biological advancement can be obtained.

You know, being immortal, sailing through the Universe, doing whatever we wish, basically becoming the closest thing to a God that can exist. Wont it get boring after awhile? When I was younger and I played certain video games, I got sick of following the rules/storyline so I would turn on all the cheat codes and go around doing whatever I wanted aka “Godmode.” Eventually I became so bored with the game after doing everything several times, that I put the game down and never played it again. Well I have a feeling, this applies to transhumanism as well. How many times can you see a new solar system before it gets old? How many planets do we have to land on and explore before they all begin to look the same? I love scientific advancement, but when the last possible thing is invented... we're screwed...

I have always been interested in biomedical engineering, artificial intelligence, the cosmos, and physics; but I am at a crossroads and have to make up my mind.

A few days ago I had my run in with mortality... (This is the long dramatic version, below it will be a TLDR, followed by the point of this post.)

I was playing a light-hearted game of frisbee with two of my friends at a park, when all of the sudden- it hit me like a linebacker. A thud in my chest, un-matched by anything I've ever felt before, followed by a brief moment of silence. 

I looked back at my friends for re-assurance. I wanted to see if I was still here, in reality. My heart was now pumping with a pace three times greater than before. My body was flooded with anxiety, and my mind with fear. I collapsed to the ground, laid on my back, expecting nothing short of a return voyage back to my previous state of health and security. I was not taken back. I was rushed to the ER and taken in to get a cardioversion to stop and reset my heart. It worked. My heart rate went down from 220~ to 2 and then, a few seconds later, back up to 98~.

The doc told me I have SVT. He said that during the attack, my heart was pumping at a rate that did not give my blood enough time to fill it. I have been given short term medicine for severe anxiety and am back at home. In a few days I will be seeing a cardiologist to see if my condition can be cured with an ablation.

TLDR: heart problems

Prior to this incident I was certain of my path. Physics. I was sure I would get my PhD and that I would spend the rest of my days very happily working in a lab and very happily spending my free time. Not anymore. During my cardioversion I had a weird experience. My body said I was dead, but my mind said I was fine. I have been given the opportunity to reconsider my college career. 

I am a freshmen who just registered for my first classes at a four year university. I have been dwelling on the idea of living a similar life that I had planned before, but with an emphasis on a transhumanist agenda. Maybe major in computer science and artificial intelligence, or biomedical engineering, idk. Now that brings me to....

",Former___Lurker,22,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/v8fmy/sens_rejuvenation_biotechnologies_and_research/,"Hello fellow Transhumanists. I am a volunteer for the [SENS foundation.](http://www.SENS.org) As stated on our website, ""The SENS Foundation works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to rejuvenation biotechnologies which comprehensively address the disabilities and diseases of aging.""

I have been active on r/transhuman for some time.  I have recently discovered this subreddit and would like to post this information on here as well.  I apologize if some of you have already seen this material before.

Given the obvious support for this research, and research in similar fields, I thought it might be a good idea to reach out to people so obviously passionate about transhumanism and all of the technology that will hopefully open the door for us to it.

Located [here](http://www.sens.org/files/pdf/SENS_Foundation_Annual_Report_2011.pdf) is a PDF file of the 2011 annual report published by SENS. For the sake of simplicity, it is broken up into these parts:

- Research: What research is being conducted now, in the future, and what progress has been made thus far.

- Outreach: How SENS is getting the word out about their efforts, and a short list of who they are collaborating with to further the cause.

- Education: What SENS is doing to educate and involve students in their work.

- Funding &amp; Finances: A simple breakdown of funding.

I would be happy to address any questions or concerns you may have. Feel free to contact me with anything you may want to discuss and I will be happy to answer it!  Also, if anyone is interested in volunteer work for SENS, we would greatly appreciate the support.  If so, feel free to shoot me a message with your contact information.  There are many different ways in which you can help out with this effort, even if you have zero background in science-related fields.

Human was a very loose term in its mind. Calling it a Human was more akin to calling it a worm or an insect, even those things no longer existed. No it preferred to think of itself as consciousness. 

Consciousness has spent eons learning everything and solving every puzzle, now it turned itself to one final question. What next?

It thought without words and more with a kind of lucid dream, the universe had become dark long ago, and Consciousness had drifted towards the edge of the universe and beyond, it explored realms of pure time and pure space, it travelled in drifts of energy and through black holes in boredom. Because that's what it was bored. 

It remained unthinking for infinity, before that too became boring. It decided to suicide, Being bored as Consciousness was not an unpleasant thing or a pleasant thing. Emotions were dull and archaic.

Consciousness decided that it could compress space time to a single point. If it created gravity so powerful that the universe shrank to an infinitesimal size. This would then explode in fresh creation.

It knew then that it had been in a cycle of death and rebirth this way for an unlimited amount of time. The same universe the exact same outcomes each time. Or was this the very first cycle? or even that every cycle was this cycle since it was a product of that universe, all that complexity and chaos, Consciousness was little more than a simple sine wave of entropy, equaling zero. 

Consciousness thought that the inevitable and logical action was to commence a restart on itself, funny how humanity had now become the thing it thought itself somehow separate from.

It pondered for a moment that no God (other than itself) existed and no other universes did either just the simple dimensions that powered this one. Space and time was just straight lines on a grid, never crossing, with only gravity pressing tunnels between. 

Its thoughts died as it began to compress space back to a low entropy state of endless potential and light.

1342716485.0,15,self.transhumanism,wtoqw,A perfect connectome of your neurons with no protein interaction is like a perfect streetmap of Manhattan with no people living there -- what is wrong with this analogy against hosting human consciousness?,keyofg,17,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/wtoqw/a_perfect_connectome_of_your_neurons_with_no/,"Some background:
[In the comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/wr4ue/brain_preservation_foundation/) here at transhumanism, user eleitl has included a link to an excellent article on connectome research called The Strange Neuroscience of Immortality. The article follows Kenneth Hayorth's work in connectome research, and makes a very strong argument for the possibility that your consciousness can one day be emulated using a detailed map of all neurons and connections within your brain.

I very much recommend [reading it](http://chronicle.com/article/The-Strange-Neuroscience-of/132819/).

But now for my problem: The article also contains one very strong analogy as to why hosting a consciousness within a connectome will never happen:

*The Baylor neuroscientist David Eagleman offers an analogy. Suppose that an alien creates a perfect street map of Manhattan. Would that explain how Manhattan functions and what makes it unique? To answer those questions, he says, the alien would need to see what's happening inside those buildings, how people are interacting. Dropping the analogy, Eagleman says, ""Maybe we need to know the states of the individual proteins, their exact spatial distributions, how they articulate with neighboring proteins, and so on."" To understand the brain well enough to copy it, neurons might be insufficient.*

*""Neuroscience is obsessed with neurons because our best technology allows us to measure them,"" Eagleman says. ""But each individual neuron is in fact as complicated as a city, with millions of proteins inside of it, trafficking and interacting in extraordinarily complex biochemical cascades.""*

To me this analogy really takes the wind out of the sails of connectome research for the purpose of hosting a human consciousness: A perfect map of the neurons in your brain, all triggering exactly the same way as they would in your real brain, does not seem to account for the complex chemical and protein interactions occurring behind the scenes.

Is there any insight as to why this analogy may be flawed in some way? 

**EDIT: (3 days later) ...................**

Reading your posts and thinking more on this, I realized the best part about the Manhattan analogy is it demands more from the connectome. A map is not enough. For starters, there's no way you can make an accurate brain without making an accurate body to go with it.... all of your emotional cues come from it... for instance, how would you tell a connectome that it just took an Advil? 

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/wvtzh/in_a_first_an_entire_organism_is_simulated_by/) just got posted here at transhumanism and I'm laughing because it pretty much addresses that question. A program for every cell (and a program to oversee all cells). Could this system give a realistic enough input for a connectome to fire accordingly? Maybe. It sure is fun to think about. Thanks for all your responses.

One major advance, though, is still thoroughly mired in controversy and stigma, with a reputation primarily for being a creepy fringe cult for nutjobs and weirdos. There's already tremendous work being done to develop the fundamental science, and to organize that research into a coherent roadmap, but there's no concerted effort yet to tell the world that this might really come true - or why that might even be a good thing.

So, let's start an advocacy group dedicated to promoting the possibility of mind uploading.

I'm looking for volunteers to help me design and create this group. This means people with experience anywhere in marketing strategy, brand management, business development, defining marketing plans and campaigns, SEO, market research/analysis, project management, conducting and measuring campaigns, etc. We'd start by looking for more volunteers to round out the team, then gradually add bigger projects, build an image, and ultimately - if we can build critical mass - work toward hosting conferences and mainstream advertising.

This is a question that's been floating around in my head for a while.

One of the fundamental assumptions of economic theory is 'perfect information'. Many inefficiencies in economic and social systems can be explained by imperfect information, and it is usually the agent with more information that gets the better deal.

Whole sectors of our modern economy are built around gathering reliable information. Science is dedicated to gathering and deciphering accurate information. The justice system's goal is to gather correct information so it can make valid judgement. 

Humans' ability to store and examine information continually expands as data storage becomes cheaper and technology becomes better. Tools to gather information will become better and more ubiquitous as well. It seems to me that as information becomes cheaper and as our ability to sift through information becomes better, we could enter a period of collective omniscience. 

For example, if video cameras are so ubiquitous, that literally every person's actions are recorded, there would never be a question of what actions a person took. If we gain technology to decipher thoughts, and if the technology becomes cheap enough, it is possible that there would not be a question of what anybody ever thought. And if technology develops such that the swathe of information is easily searchable and accessible, then all you would need is a question to find the answer.

I think dystopian future predictions involving no privacy and surveillance would only be true in cases of information asymmetry. As long as all surveillance information was public information, I think it would be beneficial to push into a privacy-absent future. And it seems likely to me that transhumans would have the ability to sort through that amount of information.

TL;DR: Will transhumans have access to infinite amounts of information and will they have the ability to evaluate it in useful ways?

What are your thoughts on a world with no privacy? If the lack of privacy extends to all individuals and circumstances, will culture and society adjust with net positive outcomes?

What jumps at me from looking into molecular biology isn't a million of answers but rather a billion of questions, the complexity of life is paralyzing more than empowering.

Another way to put it: what is truly uncovered by medical science is that we aren't just standing before an abyss but in free fall inside of it and we may recite our prayers or follow the latest findings of science to the T but the abyss is just too huge for any man to comprehend. Whatever we do there still will be a countless number of things that can go wrong and at any moment any of us may fall victim to a hidden variable or a random accident. I don't really see any other option but to consider ourselves already dead and accept that the point of life isn't me our you but that we have to look beyond our individual selves for purpose.

So I think it's best not to put all your hopes into the future bringing with it a solution but to just create some comforting but most certainly incorrect way of explaining this chaos to yourself.",,False,self,t5_2qlii,False,,,True,t3_tg3gz,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/tg3gz/faith_in_technology/,

I cannot remember the citation for the graph, but here is the gist of what I remember:

1. Roman civilization starts of well, with freedoms which do not violate freedoms. Stuff like freedom to vote, believe personal superstitions, preach etc. Trade with the entire world increases. Technology improves from what was available then with economic growth.

2. 300 A.D. Roman Economic Recession happens. And the Roman emperor goes nuts. He executes a lot of traders and usurpers after blaming them for all the problems. Fixes prices. Dilutes coins with not so valuable metals. Increases military spending. And after a while Roman empire is gone. No more inventions.

3. Song Dynasty in China kicks in. Lots of freedoms again, just like the Roman empire. Very low taxes. Businessmen have the freedom to do whatever they want. They go SpaceX style missions to India over the sea exchanging china clay utensils for textiles from India. Lots of sunk cargo in South China Sea. Most importantly, a truck load of innovations. Almost everything the Chinese is credited to have invented was invented during this period.

4. Ming Dynasty in China comes to power. Not so much freedoms. Lot of government micromanagement. Not as many inventions or trade compared to the Song Dynasty.

5. Meanwhile in the western world, Charter of Liberties and Magna Carta is implemented. More and more freedoms. Slow climb out of the western dark age begins. Arabs &amp; Indians are having a great time with freedoms of thought and exchange, resulting in real goodies and technology and commodities to be coveted. The western civilization is tired of getting stuff from the Arab middlemen. SpaceX style missions to trade ideas and goods begin. A hell lot of discoveries in science, followed by intellectual property right law followed by technological inventions.

We might be on the downward trend of the western Renaissance now.

So why aren't we ALL working 20 or 25 hours per week and playing with our kids more and going to the beach?

Because owners of the fruit of productivity gains are business owners (like me).  If/when a business owner puts a tool in the hands of an employee that doubles the employee's productivity, the employ does not get their salary doubled.  Employees rent out their productivity.

Society as a whole gains as products become cheaper and cheaper and/or quality improves.

Yes, it takes ""philanthropic mindsets"" or socialistic mindsets.  In ""Player Piano"" every worker now displaced has a better standard of living than they had when they were working, but they have no ""purpose"", nothing to do.  The ones who do work are engineers and managers, and they don't have much to do either, usually just push a few buttons.

Many years ago in Reader's Digest there was an article about ""time saving"" devices and why we're not saving time.  A good example was that early in the 1900's almost every middle class household had a maid who every week would come, take the rugs outside, and beat them to clean them.  Then the vacuum cleaner was invented, the maid fired, and the lady-of-the-house now vacuumed the rugs, ADDING to her time spent on household chores rather than saving time.  Same went for household market delivery of foods - ""supermarkets"" meant now the lady-of-the-house spent time shopping.

I don't presume to have the answer, but it's not sci-fi anymore, it's happening today.  Our society is highly productive and also as a consumer society we're at minimum at a ""pause"" point where maybe we just don't need/want more ""stuff"" - houses are built to last 100 years and we're keeping our cars longer too.""

Thank you all so much for commenting on this, the responses have been great. The uploading thing has always struck me as bad (as has disintegration/reintegration teleportation tech) because it seems like you wouldn't shift perspective, but rather a clone would arise with your memories and you would be dead.

I am invited on SHARE in Croatia and I am working on two presentations/articles for the conference. Last year my presentation was based on this article :

* http://blog.khanneasuntzu.com/?p=2306

It was cut down to this

It was sort of OK I suppose, good audience reception, and Aubrey and Bruce were there too. I got to rub shoulders with teh VIPS.

This years conference theme is ""Cyberpunk"" and I have always had a pretty dystopia affirming mindset. Sadly I got sick last year October with a severe stomach infection while in the tropics and I never fully recovered since then. I have had some motivational issues and depression.

Hence I have been slow formulating the content for my two talks for late july... 

I would like to ask my brethren and kinfolk here for suggestions. Of course the topics of Bitcoin and NSA will be mulled over there a lot. Massive number of Pirates on the Bitcoin boat this year.

Goal: Monastic Humanist/Trans-Humanist Order

Why?: To create a group of people and their supporters who will usher Mankind into a new age and the new stage of Evolution.

Purposes: They will be part Scientist, Philosopher, Warrior and Arbitrator, men and women whom transcended humanity yet embraced the most positive aspects of human nature. They will be the Guardians of Man. If nations fall these armored individuals will spread learning and light to them, if nations bicker they will try to reason, if we as a people have need they will seek out those answers and ultimately they will be custodian to the greatest collection of works penned by the hands of Mankind.

They will be the culmination of all current human knowledge and effort, partially a work of genetic and mechanical art, educated extensively, drilled in ethics, with an access to the depths of knowledge and the ability to simplify it for consumption amongst the populace. For the truth is men are inspired by deed as much as word, they must be heroes of a new age. If we falter and fall, they will be there to pick up the pieces as the firebrands of reason and order.

I am aware I am ""soap boxing"" it. But hey, isn't that what the interwebs are for? :)

For the last century or so our species has established a dynamic where high-technology is out of reach of all but the wealthiest institutions.

These institutions (federal governments), for better or for worse, possess a monopoly on high-technology. Genetic engineering, synthetic biology, advanced physics, etc... have all been, it seems, cost prohibitive to nearly all organizations, particularly those that have as their driving component the need to acquire capital.

What outcomes arise from such a dynamic? What I am posing here is that technological progress has been restricted by setting such a high price, thus reducing access. Maybe it wasn't the original plan, but perhaps it arose from the realization that it may be beneficial. 

We can appreciate that much of technological R&amp;D is prohibitively expensive. We can safely say that misuse or abuse of technology poses a substantial risk, particularly the convergence of untested technologies. Finally, we can pose that the security clearance infrastructure reduces access. Given these factors, is it so illogical to assume that in order to help ensure species survival, we instituted an access-reducing mechanism, so nearly all human beings (95%), are unable to pursue volatile technologies simply because *it is too costly to do so?*

Are we crazy to assume this is intentional? Consider the tech-transfer industry. We accept as canon that the Federal governments of the world must shoulder the cost of advanced R&amp;D, and that when certain technologies are deemed transferable, they will subsidize their pursuit in the public sector.

Considering this, would it be too far-fetched to say that this reduction mechanism may be keeping the worst of us from the rest of us?

Haven't we all wondered what we are actually capable of? Maybe new energy systems, advanced genetics, quantum technologies, etc... have, in fact, made enough progress to achieved our 'leap' into the next stage of humanity, but the risks are so profound, an system of economics has been implemented to prevent flying to close to the sun too quickly. 

Thoughts?

Note: It's likely many will assume I am being ""conspiratorial."" Far from it. I'm assuming that at some level there's been coordination, both logical and moral, to help ensure we don't kill ourselves.

The races competing in this far-future world represent various lines that will be points of contention as transhumanism becomes the driving force behind our evolution.

CLASSIFICATION 0, or “Primitives”
Humans who reject not just bodily alteration, but also electronic technolgy and industrially-produced medicine altogether.  The Amish of the future.  They are usually bound together by religious ties and have very short lifespans.  Their living conditions have caused them to become very well physically-adapted to their environments.
Primitives hold no power on a larger than local scale.  They are as irrelevant now as chimps were at the dawn of the 21st Century.  They have been granted ecologically-viable land on multiple worlds, which are protected as wildlife preserves.  Their ability to protect this land from higher beings, should such beings ever decide to take it away, is nonexistent.

CLASSIFICATION 1, or “Purists”
Humans who are very close to who we are today.  They will take drugs as long as they don’t involve intelligent nanomachines or genetic therapy.  They will even make use of external cybernetics like night vision glasses and communication headsets.  Most are also willing to use low-tech cybernetics like cochlear implants to cure deafness and replacement limbs for the disabled.
Purists eke out a small amount of relevance by making use of remotely- and directly-piloted vehicles with non-invasive brain-to-computer interfaces.  They are, however, not seen as a legitimate military power by most of the higher-classification beings.
Some purists, classified “1i,” are willing to cooperate with non-self-aware AIs such as thinking attack drones that can execute combat missions without needing to be controlled from a remote location.

CLASSIFICATION 2, or “Geneoids”
Humans, transhumans (and in some cases, posthumans) who reject cybernetics to the same degree as or to a greater degree than Classification 1 humans.  However, they are fully open to gene therapy, eugenics, and outright genetic enhancement.  They can be subdivided into Classification 2a, representing humans who accept only genetic modifications that would not cause them to exceed the bounds or anatomical forms of “natural” humans, and Classification 2b, representing those who will accept any degree of genetic modification (including things like extra limbs, reptilian skin, etc.)  A “c” is used to note those of Classification 2 who accept brain-altering modifications.  This creates two additional subclasses: 2ac and 2bc.
Like Classification 1 humans, Classification 2 transhumans and posthumans usually rely on remotely- or directly-piloted vehicles with non-invasive interfaces to perform tasks that come naturally to beings of higher classification.  They are somewhat more relevant on the galactic power scale, especially 2bs and 2bcs, due to their willingness to transcend human physical and/or mental boundaries.  However, their willingness to do so only through the relatively inefficient medium of genetic modification limits them to only holding power on a larger scale very rarely.
Genoids that cooperate with non-self-aware AI are classified with an “i,” as in “2bci,” designating the most liberal of the Class 2s.

CLASSIFICATION 3, or “Cyborgs”
Transhumans in this category are willing to accept a vast variety of cybernetics, as extreme as having every cell in their body replaced by a carbon-based nanocomputer.  Many are not attached to the human anatomical form, and will instead choose forms based on things like starships, submersibles, and land vehicles.  Many change their physical form regularly.  Some, referred to as “Classification 3-multi,” are comfortable with operating multiple copies of their neural structure in multiple physical housings that might be light years apart.
What sets them apart from higher-classification posthumans is their unwillingness to give up the brain.  They require any modifications to their physical form to preserve the neural structure and operation of the biological brain they were born with.  Additional software that supplements this structure is accepted by most, but any software must be subservient to the “Neuro-seed,” and alterations to it are forbidden by any means.
Classification 3 are the lowest classification of beings that hold some form of power on a galactic scale.  Especially in the case of 3-multis, they can often compete for resources on fronts that are deemed too unimportant by higher classification beings to commit too much energy to.  They rule the fringes of space.
In the case of “Hard 3s,” sexual reproduction and cloning is still often used to create new Neuro-seeds.  3-multis, however, generally expand their numbers simply by creating more copies of existing Neuro-seeds.
Class 3s that cooperate with non-self-aware AIs are not given their own classification, as it would be redundant.  The line between a “non-self-aware AI” and the neural accessory processors used by Class 3s is virtually nonexistent.

Calssification 4: “Independent AIs”
Posthumans who have given up every vestige of what biological humanity represented.  They take whatever forms they wish, copy and evolve their software through millions of iterations a year, existing in thousands of places at once, and network with others like them to pool information and resources.
Where they have drawn the line is at individuality.  Each Classification 4 being has an identity at the core of their software, dating back to a human birth and upbringing in the annals of the past.  They refuse to be subsumed into any form of collective consciousness, and are capable of keeping secrets and making decisions independent of the input of other entities.
Classification 4s were the dominant force in the galaxy for a great while, before the rise of their successor.  Even today, they still control large portions of rich space that the “Great Enemy” has not yet devoted time and resources to dominating.  They fight amongst each-other uncommonly, and in some areas battle guerrilla bands of Classification 3s looking to carve resources off the edges of their territory.  They regard their primary opponent with a sort of Cold War, nonviolent watchfulness.  It seems to be doing the same, for now.

Classification 5: “PHMO”
Referred to as “Pheemo” by those beings who still use their mouths to articulate language (and are even aware of its existence), PHMO stands for Post-Human Meta-Organism.  It is technology unbounded by any sense of ethics: an essentially godlike network of trillions of machines of varying sizes and functions, most of which can change form at will to suit any situation.  It holds the memories and experiences, as well as all recorded knowledge, of every human and computer that contributed to its mainframes at some point in the past.  It can access, analyze, and synthesize all of this data with perfect recall and at the speed of light, collating it with the new data it is collecting constantly from all of its networked sensor units.
There is no doubt that PHMO has become the dominant force in the Milky Way galaxy, and in all likelihood may already be operating beyond it.  Few are operating under the delusion that it couldn’t wipe out all lower-classification beings if it really wanted to.  Class 4s have fought massive engagements with its fleets too many times to count, but it never seems to go in for the kill in the end.  For now, it seems to have deemed to tolerate lesser intelligent existences operating in its shadow.  How long that state of affairs will last, not even the greatest minds of the Class 4s can precisely predict.",,False,self,t5_2qlii,False,,,True,t3_kigol,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/kigol/writing_a_scifi_story_based_on_transhumanism/,

Thanks for your help.   

Update: Thanks, great replies- considering Gibson can be so far be tenuously linked to all three, I have a few more questions. 

In relation to my original question, are the mind and body in different places when we experience cyberspace? -The analogy of lucid dreaming suggests so, but BCI suggests a much more fluid link between mind and body.  

To what degree will/are technologies such as BCI offered equally? Will there be issues of a widening gap between the 'haves' and 'have not'- though perhaps between the vintage worn out humans and a post-human elite?- The chap from Cyberkinetics, on the BrainGate vid, expects insurance companies to cough up the costs. Emotiv etc. seems much more assessable.

1326526533.0,2,self.transhumanism,oglc9,What are some issues that a post singularity society might face? (xpost from r/singularity),no_witty_username,2,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/oglc9/what_are_some_issues_that_a_post_singularity/,"I would like to hear what you guys think will be some of the issues that a post singularity society will be dealing with. Also it would be great to hear of what you think the resolutions to those issues might be.
Ill start off with some ideas I have floating in my head.
Does a virtual human posses the same rights as a biological human?
What constitutes a virtual human?
Do your virtual human clones posses the same rights as the original?
How are the resources relocated once you clone your self?
What is the currency of a post singularity society?
How is this currency distributed?
How is the currency obtained?
Who distributes the currency?
How to shield against EMP?
What are the rules and regulations concerning virtual backups?
This issue will be a very complex matter to resolve. At first you might think, o that's an easy one, of course the'll have the same rights. But then you have to consider that a virtual human and a biological human have become two totally different entities capable of vastly different abilities. For example a virtual human will have a backup in case of local death where as a biological human might not. One can deduce that a virtual death will not be seen as traumatic as a biological one. You can imagine that laws regarding homicide, manslaughter, negligence will be applied differently depending on whether he is virtual or not. Also consider that a virtual human might decide to murder innocent sentient NPC's who were random spawns of Grand Theft Auto 12, should he be accountable for those murders? In the end I expect that at the beginning of the singularity virtual humans will posses less rights then their biological counterparts, shortly after they will gain the same rights and eventually they will posses greater rights then their biological counterparts. At the apex of the singularity biological beings will be viewed as nothing more then bygone remnants of chemical evolution. They will posses little if any power over the course of foreseen future.
Defining what a virtual human is will become harder as time passes and entities evolve in the virtual realm. Virtual entities will become so different from what we now consider human that I think eventually no one will care what your label is. But in the beginning it will be an ongoing struggle to define what is human in order to figure out what possesses rights and privileges.
I think virtual clones will possess same rights as the original but those rights will start to diverge depending if the clone stagnates or excels in his intelligence. More intelligent = more rights, and reverse. The argument is that you wouldn't give a monkey the right to vote on issues it doesn't comprehend.
I think it would be fair to distribute resources proportionally to the intelligence of the clones. That is to say if you cloned your self and modified his intelligence to be greater then your's, then it would be immoral to grant him an equal share of your resources.
The currency is processing power and storage. Every intelligent entity will strive to horde as much processing power and storage as possible. This will make raw materials such as land very valuable, for once replication of advanced synthetic processes is cheap and easy, land will be of the utmost premium. Start buying now folks! Once every piece of land is converted to a processor that 1 acre of land you own will make you filthy rich.
This I have no Idea. I mean its a double edged sword. If you don't possess the necessary processing power to begin with, how are you expected to contribute to progress and gain more? Currently humans are in pretty much the same boat as far as intelligence spread goes. Everyone has roughly the same capabilities, only environmental and social boundaries exist that impeded personal progress. But what are you to do if you are thrust in to a virtual realm where you are an equivalent retard among others. Maybe if we have super AI as the governing force and equal distribution of resources it will help things, but I just don't see it. Equal distribution of resources doesn't make sense because more intelligent entities will always demand more resources.
Obtaining more land will yield more processing power. So I think once every ounce of earth is used up and converted, one will have to set on a journey for more raw resources. IT will be forced space exploration out of necessity for raw materials.
Manifest destiny. Basically land squatting will be the norm. I found this piece of asteroid, its mines so shove off. Tho I do think a basic welfare system will be in place to provide some allocations of processing power and storage to the newly born AI and converted virtual entities. These welfare resources would be distributed by some Super AI governing system.
Advanced EMP devises will be the equivalent of Nuclear bombs of today. They will strike fear in to every virtual entity. I think some advanced forms of shielding will be created but have no idea what.
Backup regulations will have to be standardized in order to prevent rampant replication of redundant entities. A system will have to be very sure that the original has perished or sustained significant unmitigated alterations (errors, fragmentation, virus alteration) before a backup is released. I think a virtual entity will have some control under what circumstances a backup is released but wont have control of other standardized regulations.",,False,self,t5_2qlii,False,,,True,t3_oglc9,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/oglc9/what_are_some_issues_that_a_post_singularity/,

**Surrogate 1.0** - 2024 - Model have all your memories, your voice, automated will, programmed desires and direct connection to the web, your surrogate can explain everything available on the web for a kid or to a nuclear scientist thanks to its ultra fast connection speed and ultra awesome neural intel® thing. World population is stoked, it's still *very* expensive.  The machine is a reality thanks to the biggest joint venture ever, between IBM, SIEMENS, INTEL, APPLE and NOKIA. Microsoft want it's own version.


**Surrogate 2.0** - 2029/30 - All the features of 1.0 plus an algorithm of your personality and now your eyes can record/stream in HD1080, is also a phone and can cook all recipes ever to perfection. Now the machines are working on their self improvement and the 3.0 version will be completely designed BY machines.


**Surrogate 3.0** - 2033 (first self made one) - 2034 - (fist public version) Real personality and fine detailed memory to even consider your traumas and life experience (past and future) on decision making (it's still a 'repository of yourself'). People start to consider the machines desire to reproduce among humans and other bio machines (as your sperms/eggs can get ""3D bio printed as a new baby"" inside the surrogate reproductive system since this version).


**Surrogate 4.0** - Year 2042 - Humans begin to consider full switch to bio machines as the bio machine is a 102% clone of yourself, you ARE that copy. Thanks to the ""Link"" you and your bio clone can experience the same things in real time if the *link* is on (you or AKA the surrogate matrix). Humanity faces a paradigm because machines are already reproducing among themselves and are on the move to start the colonization of other planets where humans can't survive. Earth 2.0 is a real thing, bio-machine colonized. 


**Surrogate 5.0** - Year 2051 - Bio machines are creating on Mars (now with thousands bio machine citizens) a new kind of 'remote 3D printing' sending information through light. Bio machines can create other bio machines on other planets and suddenly space ships are no longer necessary for traveling (for the bio machines, as they can totally 'print' multiple copies of themselves on other planets and even other galaxies). Humans are considered a deprecated version of the bio machines. Natural humans get massive tech/health benefits from the bio machines intelligence and Earth is now interplanetarely considered to be planet 0. 


**Surrogate 6.0** - Year 2074 - Natural humans can talk for the first time with extraterrestrial beings thanks to bio machines galaxy colonizers. Humans face their ultimate faith challenge and culture trade with intergalactic species is a common thing for kids (both humans and bio machines) that born from this year on. Human language is no longer used among bio machines as machines don't need colloquial logic to 'understand' each other.

Alright, so there's this thing called a nanobot, maybe you've heard of it.

It's function is to move one atom from one place to another.

THIS IS MIND BOGGLING, because with this technology we can do literally ANYTHING. Moving around individual atoms could most certainly get us to a higher level of consciousness. We could literally fix anything on our body, and more. I could even shit fire and spit ice with this technology.

The problem?

Atoms are small. It would take more than a lifetime to even make something see-able by the human eye.

The goal?

The goal now is to make a nanobot with two functions.

1. Move one atom from one place to another
2. Replicate itself

So then there would be two bots, then four bots, then eight bots, and so on until theres an army of nanobots that could change anything at our whim.

This could potentially let us live forever.

(re-post from r/singularity),no_witty_username,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/transhumanism/comments/oglt4/what_are_some_issues_that_a_post_singularity/,"What are some issues that a post singularity society might face? 



I would like to hear what you guys think will be some of the issues that a post singularity society will be dealing with.  Also it would be great to hear of what you think the resolutions to those issues might be.

Ill start off with some ideas I have floating in my head.

1.  Does a virtual human posses the same rights as a biological human?  
2.  What constitutes a virtual human?  
3.  Do your virtual human clones posses the same rights as the original?  
4.  How are the resources relocated once you clone your self?

5.  What is the currency of a post singularity society?  
6.  How is this currency distributed?  
7.  How is the currency obtained? 
8.  Who distributes the currency? 

9.  How to shield against EMP?
10.  What are the rules and regulations concerning virtual backups?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  This issue will be a very complex matter to resolve.  At first you might think, o that's an easy one, of course the'll have the same rights.  But then you have to consider that a virtual human and a biological human have become two totally different entities capable of vastly different abilities.  For example a virtual human will have a backup in case of local death where as a biological human might not.  One can deduce that a virtual death will not be seen as traumatic as a biological one.  You can imagine that laws regarding homicide, manslaughter, negligence will be applied differently depending on whether he is virtual or not.  Also consider that a virtual human might decide to murder innocent sentient NPC's who were random spawns of Grand Theft Auto 12, should he be accountable for those murders?  In the end I expect that at the beginning of the singularity virtual humans will posses less rights then their biological counterparts, shortly after they will gain the same rights and eventually they will posses greater rights then their biological counterparts.  At the apex of the singularity biological beings will be viewed as nothing more then bygone remnants of chemical evolution.  They will posses little if any power over the course of foreseen future.

2.  Defining what a virtual human is will become harder as time passes and entities evolve in the virtual realm.  Virtual entities will become so different from what we now consider human that I think eventually no one will care what your label is.  But in the beginning it will be an ongoing struggle to define what is human in order to figure out what possesses rights and privileges. 

3.  I think virtual clones will possess same rights as the original but those rights will start to diverge depending if the clone stagnates or excels in his intelligence.  More intelligent = more rights, and reverse.  The argument is that you wouldn't give a monkey the right to vote on issues it doesn't comprehend.     

4.  I think it would be fair to distribute resources proportionally to the intelligence of the clones.  That is to say if you cloned your self and modified his intelligence to be greater then your's,  then it would be immoral to grant him an equal share of your resources.  

5.  The currency is processing power and storage.  Every intelligent entity will strive to horde as much processing power and storage as possible.  This will make raw materials such as land very valuable, for once replication of advanced synthetic processes is cheap and easy, land will be of the utmost premium.  Start buying now folks! Once every piece of land is converted to a processor that 1 acre of land you own will make you filthy rich.  

6.  This I have no Idea.  I mean its a double edged sword.  If you don't possess the necessary processing power to begin with, how are you expected to contribute to progress and gain more?  Currently humans are in pretty much the same boat as far as intelligence spread goes.  Everyone has roughly the same capabilities, only environmental and social boundaries exist that impeded personal progress.  But what are you to do if you are thrust in to a virtual realm where you are an equivalent retard among others.  Maybe if we have super AI as the governing force and equal distribution of resources it will help things, but I just don't see it.  Equal distribution of resources doesn't make sense because more intelligent entities will always demand more resources.    

7.  Obtaining more land will yield more processing power.   So I think once every ounce of earth is used up and converted, one will have to set on a journey for more raw resources.  IT will be forced space exploration out of necessity for raw materials.

8.  Manifest destiny.  Basically land squatting will be the norm.  I found this piece of asteroid, its mines so shove off.  Tho I do think a basic welfare system will be in place to provide some allocations of processing power and storage to the newly born AI and converted virtual entities.  These welfare resources would be distributed by some Super AI governing system.    

9.  Advanced EMP devises will be the equivalent of Nuclear bombs of today.  They will strike fear in to every virtual entity.  I think some advanced forms of shielding will be created but have no idea what.

10.  Backup regulations will have to be standardized in order to prevent rampant replication of redundant entities.  A system will have to be very sure that the original has perished or sustained significant unmitigated alterations (errors, fragmentation, virus alteration) before a backup is released.  I think a virtual entity will have some control under what circumstances a backup is released but wont have control of other standardized regulations.
