In the past 15 months, the house has just gone into a state of disarray since my mother became disabled. Apparently, he didn't do a very good job and he isn't around anymore to fix things like plumbing issues, electricity issues (for example, there's no lighting in the kitchen and it's not short circuiting or dead bulbs). We've just been letting things in need of repair go and have just been using a different part of the house but it's getting bad. We can't afford to have professionals come in to fix things so I figure I'd take some matters into my own hands.

I'm handy when I know what I'm doing and have helped my father repair small issues around the house and there haven't been issues with them since. I have all the tools for repairs. However, I can't lift relatively heavy things (think over 45 pounds, which is well over a 1/3 of my body weight.) easily or anything like long, wide PVC piping seeing as I'm also extremely short and in danger of toppling over (haha!).

Is this fixable? If it can't be done at home, who should I go to?

Thanks, fixit.

Edit:
This is for a metal screw in metal casing, rather than plastic or wood.

Best suggestions:

1. Try to apply pressure from below while unscrewing, so that the threads actually grip the correct thing and it can come out.

2. Drill out the screw, replace it. &lt;--- Last ditch effort, but will work.",,False,self,t5_2rf27,True,,,True,t3_l3prp,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/l3prp/how_to_remove_a_screw_with_broken_threads/,

(images inside)",clintmccool,22,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/19ct5z/dropped_a_piece_of_my_breakfast_down_the_stove/,"http://imgur.com/a/fXLlQ#0

So usually, there's a screen in the vent that prevents this exact thing from happening. But someone (no idea who, almost certainly my brother) left it tilted the wrong way so rather than blocking the vent, it in fact acted as a ramp to funnel dropped items *into* the vent.

I don't want to leave a piece of ham festering down there, and I need to get the screwdriver back, too. If it was just the ham, I could probably resign myself to jabbing at random with a sharp implement for 45 minutes to an hour, but like a genius, I dropped a screwdriver down there too and need to get that back also.

I've attempted to dig up any kind of detailed drawings online as to how this thing is assembled, but I have come up with nothing.

Worth noting is the fact that I can't get my arm in there, the twists are too tight, and I can't see what I'm doing with any kind of probing tool, which is why I've resorted to taking some of it apart rather than fishing endlessly.

So I guess my main question is, does anyone know if that ""shelf"" is meant to come out or if there's an easy way to take it out? That would be my preferred solution.

Failing that, does anyone have any good drawings or diagrams as to how this thing is actually put together?

Otherwise, unless there's another good way to do this, I guess I'll attempt again to take the ""wedge"" off and cross my fingers that I don't ruin the screws.

Or maybe try to find someone with smaller hands.

If you need more details on anything, let me know.

Thanks guys.

**edit/update**: Turns out there *were* screws holding the 'shelf' in place... approximately four hundred of them, located so as to be almost impossible to reach and definitely impossible to see. I'm not sure why that shelf has to be so secure, but the ham has been retrieved.

The blockage at 6 ft from the sink drain pipe remains a mystery, so I assume just a bad bend in the pipe that isn't visible.  The one much further down the line was the obstruction causing the back-up.  It didn't break up, even with the power auger; it had to be pushed thru the 2 inch line, all the way into the 4 inch exit pipe.  What the plumber termed ""an *object*"" (his emphasis).  He was baffled as to how it got thru our sump-pump/ejector and into the line in the first place.** 

My ground floor kitchen sink backed up last night after the basement sump pump (to which the basement bathroom drains) ran a cycle.  Burps of gas have happened time to time, but this time it was several gallons of water that wouldn't plunge.

1) I used [this 25ft. hand auger](http://www.harborfreight.com/25-ft-drain-cleaner-with-drill-attachment-66262.html) with a drill.  When I went thru the kitchen drain pipe, I couldn't get the auger past 6 feet, no matter the amount of force or rpms.  It was like the auger hit a wall.  I tried going thru the pipe in the basement, instead, and had the same problem, this time at 22 ft.  Any ideas as to what's going on?  Is there a secret trick to moving the auger that I need to know?

2) To spare myself another futile stab with the auger, can someone tell me with certainty that the clog is actually in the vertical vent pipe?

Eventually, the wiggle breaks the connection and I have to solder the lead back on. I've tried a few different means of securing the jack to avoid this wiggle, without success.

Mercifully, the DC jack is not soldered directly onto any board, but instead has a cable with connector.

 The jack originally was held in place by some flimsy plastic housing. I believe this originally broke a few years back, when the jack fell into the laptop -- but I don't know as it was still under warranty at the time so I just sent it in to be repaired. Regardless, there's no housing there anymore. There is a flat plastic platform on which the jack rests, but that's about it. 

I've run low on wire on the lead, so I've ordered a replacement jack+cable and want to secure it permanently this time. I'm sick of dismantling my laptop. The only thing is, I don't know what I should use to secure the jack. I have considered using a 2-part epoxy, but I'm worried that epoxy on the base of the jack won't stand up to the lateral force of inserting and removing the power cable.

What we're working with is the original fuse system installed when the house was built (label in the wall box says 1958).

**Album:** http://imgur.com/a/laJua

They keep blowing main fuses on the L1 branch (pic 1), but not any of the smaller screw in (what I'm calling 'secondary' fuses) on the same branch (pic1).

I think the previous owner may have been using incorrectly rated fuses, and they keep getting replaced with the wrong fuse now.

It looks like the L1 and L2 branches call for 31-60A fuses... Does this mean a range between 31A and 60A? Currently, the ""Range Switch"" fuses are both 30A time-delay fuses. The L1 fuse is a 60A and the L2 is a 35A. My gut says that these two should match in their rating?

Go ahead and dive in wherever you can on this. I'm going to do some more investigating today with my multimeter and confirm that the wiring correctly matches the diagrams.

**Edit 1:** Over the past month I guess the L1 or L2 (none of the roommates has bothered to take note of which) fuse has blown 3 times, the only common factor being that ""stuff"" *and* the dryer was running. The dryer is located on the farthest end of the house from the panel, and I'm guessing that it's too much of a load, on too long of a run, on too small of a wire, magnifying whatever other problems there may be.",,False,self,t5_2rf27,1364906325.0,,,True,t3_1bfsq0,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1bfsq0/help_deciphering_older_wiring_diagram_1958/,

One advantage may be that the burn is right next to the wall and radiator so if I need to pull the boards I don't think I'll need to tear up the whole floor (which sounds like a great way to make this much worse).

The basketball court is owned by the town or village and is located above a firehouse.  It's a very nice full-size court, though I do suspect the rims are at about 10'2.  Nevertheless, I play in a weekly old man's pick-up game, which is usually preceded by one of the kid's leagues, which consists of what seems like thousands of scrambling children.

I purchased a new pair of sneakers, and on the first night I was sliding around as if I'd worn them out already.  We do run a broom over the court after the children leave, which improves the floor minimally.  Unfortunately, it's just not that fun to try and intercept a pass and continue sliding as if it were a video game error, or not be able to cross-over because you can't stop the momentum of the original cross.  

If I had a day or two off, I would just like to go up there and do what I can.  Would mopping the floors improve anything, or would the kids league immediately counterbalance that?  Is there a way to resurface floors by hand?  Can this be done while not spending too much money?

So I tested the voltage on both sides of the relay and I had a solid 220.  

Now the next time the condenser tried to turn I spun the fan manually and it caught and turned over, but the compressor was still humming.  

Now I took a closer look at the start capacitor and noticed a bulge in it.  Along with the symptoms I was fairly certain the capacitor was bad.  Had to call around a bunch of places to find one, but replacing it was easy as could be and wouldn't you know it we had cold air.

I own a soldering iron and have rudimentary skills with it. But I'm willing to work for a little more knowledge to save this thing. I tried taking out the batteries, letting the capacitors discharge, and putting in a different pair of batteries, but that didn't change anything. It happens with a game in or out. It also has a bit of consistency in terms of timing (from boot to new game screen of Pokemon, and the same time if the game isn't inserted).

We aren't hurting for money, and I could easily go out and buy a new one, but it wouldn't feel right throwing this thing away.

mini update: if you press right+B on the GAMEBOY screen, it will invert the colors- which is a feature to help you play at night I think- and then when it 'breaks' a minute later, it inverts the colors back to normal. Played for 20 min... Weird.

**HAPPY UPDATE:** I'm an idiot. I have a screw driver kit with like 30 heads that I keep in my back pack in case anyone in my travels is having computer problems. Had the revelation to check there, sure enough, tri-wing head. Took out the screws, popped the back, no capacitors (of the pop cap kind, something within my skill to replace) but it was pretty dirty. Took and air can and blew out the dust on both sides of the PCB board really well, and wiped of any remaining grime. Took some pictures in case it didn't work. Put it back together and boom goes the dynamite. Flawless, no glitching, no inverting. Played for an hour.

I've had my window open all day (UK, reasonable day, bit of rain, nothing heavy) and I'm trying to close it at the moment and it wont close.

I've tried a few things, I took the mechanism out and made sure it was all okay, which it is. I tried changing it with another window in the house, perfectly fine. 

I've now just noticed that there appears to be a bit of damanged plastic on the underside of the corner. It appears to be stopping it fitting in perfectly to the fixture bit for the mechanism thats on the frame.

Anyone know how to deal with this? I was thinking of maybe sanding it down to the right size again?

Would that be a good way to deal with it?

Excuse my lack of technical jargon, I'll try to explain this to the best of my ability. The seal of my toilet cistern is not sealing correctly, so a small trickle of water is constantly dripping into the bowl, instead of building up to be dispensed in a flush. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a problem, I'd rip that sucker right off, and install a brand new, shiny, top of the range, deluxe, all terrain rubber seal on that, ensuring proper water build-up and a healthy torrential downpour to consign my expulsions to wherever the sewage system takes them.

 The problem, however, lies here. The toilet cistern is built into a wall, and can be accessed only by removing the small plastic hatch on the front. As you can see from the photo in the link, it's a tight fit, and I cannot see very well. I cannot figure out how to remove the sealing plunger, so I can take it to the plumbing store, to get one of those new, top of the range rubber seals I mentioned above. I've managed to stick one of my slender, ladylike arms in there, and felt around for moving bits, though nothing seems to contribute to my ultimate objective of removing the blasted thing.

 Do any of you have experience with such infernal devices? If so, any constructive input would be greatly appreciated.

I have been renting one side of a duplex for about a year while I look for the right house to buy.  It is heated by natural gas, and the furnace on my side is in a crawlspace under my side of the duplex accessible from the outside along with some other things (water heater, breaker box, gas meter, etc).  I moved in early last Fall before it got cold enough to turn the heat on.  Over the course of the winter, I would notice a sewer-like smell on the first floor of the duplex (mainly the living room and kitchen) from time to time.  The smell never seemed to make its way up to the second floor.  I could occasionally smell it outside, but not as often as I smelled it in the house.  I mentioned it to my landlord a few times, but nothing ever seemed to come of it.  I could never predict when the smell would be noticeable, and every time I wanted him to come smell it for himself, he wasn't available or the smell had dissipated by the time he arrived.

In the spring, I turned the heat off and set window air conditioning units in place (no central air conditioning).  At first, the smell was still there, but eventually the smell went away.  I didn't notice it again in the apartment all summer.

A week or two ago, I took out the air conditioning units and turned on the heat.  When I returned from work that day, the smell had returned and overpowered the first floor of the apartment.  I again contacted my landlord because I don't want to deal with this again over the course of the winter if I'm still here.  He came over when he got off work, and of course the smell was gone.  We tried forcing the furnace on to blow hot air (adjusted the thermostat), but we couldn't force the smell to come.  I thought the smell might be related to the furnace because it didn't start again until the exact day I turned the heat on.

We experienced a few warmer days this week, and the smell was faintly there when I got home from work yesterday, so I turned the heat off yesterday afternoon.  When I woke up for work today, the smell in the living room was strong again, despite the furnace being off.

I know very little about home repair and maintenance.  After speaking with a few people, I got suggestions that the problem may be a blocked sewer vent like the one leading up to the roof.  That makes sense to me why the smell would come up from under the apartment and affect the first floor and not the second.  I originally thought it was related to the furnace because the problem stopped when I turned the furnace off and started when I turned it on, but I left the furnace off for over 12 hours, and the smell was strong this morning.

Is it worth asking them to have a plumber check out the drains and vents?  I know these things vary, but do you have any idea how much it might cost?

About a year ago my washing machine (Kenmore top-load) stopped emptying and smelled like smoke/burning rubber. I did some research online and in the unit, and determined that the belt had fried. I replaced it and felt oh-so-handy. Yay me!

Well, then it happened again, so I replaced it again. And then it happened again, so I replaced it again. I know this shouldn't be happening. Any idea what is going on? How can I *really* fix it? The belts seem to get stuck in one spot and then the friction from the turning wheel melts it, making it less likely to turn.

It is possible to tighten or loosen the a wheel that gives the belt tension, but I don't know which way I should go, or if that is the solution. I think when I did the original replacement I tightened it because otherwise one of the wheels was hitting another part when it changed parts of the cycle.

**Background**

I bought a house in South Florida about 2 years ago and up until this past weekend everything has been fine with it.  On Friday night we had a really strong rain storm come through and quite a bit of rain all day on Saturday.  Sunday morning I noticed the carpet in the living room where my dog's bed is was soaked through to the padding. The first thing I did was pull the carpet and padding up and dry vac'd about a gallon of water out of the padding and carpet.  I called a leak inspection company Monday morning and scheduled for them to come out on Tuesday morning to find the source of the leak.

** Leak Inspection Results**

The guys that came out did a quick assessment of the window area and determined that two windows had cracked seals that needed to be repaired.  They used an IR device to check for moisture in the walls and that's when things got really interesting.  Basically the external facing wall with the window contained heavy amounts of moisture, as well as the corner where two exterior walls met.  The inspector told me that they would need to pull down a lot of the dry wall to check for mold / water damage and that my insurance company would most likely decline an insurance claim due to cracks in the stucco on the exterior of the wall.  He also gave me verbal estimate of around $30k for his company to do that work.  

Where this goes downhill very quickly and becomes really scary and intimidating is that a further inspection on the rest of the house with the IR device shows high levels moisture in all the exterior walls in the house.  These were his notes from the inspection:

* Inspection of the home (thermal) found the exterior of the home does have many small crack's and no sealer left in paint causing wind driven rain to hold in wall's.
* Found front window seal's cracked and allowing wind driven rain to enter unit (This is what I called him to find)
* Thermal test does show moisture in ceiling and walls
* I recommend a roofer to test the roof.
* Must fix all cracks / reseal exterior and paint to stop all water intrusion.

At this point I'm starting to feel like Tom Hanks in The Money Pit.  The guy just gave me a verbal estimate of $30k to fix the visible water damage that I called him to inspect for me, and now he's telling me that I have serious moisture issues throughout the house in all of the exterior facing walls.

** Things I've Done **

* I called in a claim with my insurance company, waiting to hear back from them.
* I've contacted a public adjuster who has already been to the house to give his feedback.  He said that I will most likely have to cover the costs of getting the leaks fixed myself and the house painted/sealed.  However, damages from the leak such as having drywall replaced, painted, etc should be covered by insurance.

* I've contacted a roofing company to come give an inspection on the roof.

* I've contacted a painting company to come out to give an estimate on sealing and painting the house.

** Questions **

I think that I'm pretty well set for the actual issue that I called the leak inspector out for.  Now I'm just kind of wondering what my options are for the rest of the house where no visible water damage has occurred.  

* How worried should I be from the IR scan?  Right now I'm visualizing myself in a scene from The Shining and all the blue spots on the IR scans are blood dripping from the walls :(.

* Is it normal to see moisture on an IR scan after a heavy rainstorm? I don't really have a comparison to compare to so I'm just going off what this guy said.  If I would have scanned houses up and down my street, would they have all shown similar issues?

* My understanding is that the biggest risk from water damage is when mold and mildew sets in.  If I get the house sealed up ASAP, am I safe to just have a mold test done after things dry out to see if I even have further issues?

Edit: We've also just noticed that when a bathroom light is turned on downstairs, the dining room light dims. When the bathroom light is turned off, the dining room light brightens up...

Edit 2: More weird shit is happening now... Our electric stove is not working. Turning on the garbage disposal causes the kitchen lights to go off. Also, and I'm not sure about this, the bathroom fan upstairs is running a lot quieter than usual.

Edit 3: Neighbors (we live in a townhouse) have confirmed having similar issues.

Update: Electric company came out. Me and the neighbor both got  temporary transformers installed. Everything is back to normal for now (except that now I have to look into getting that rusty box replaced. A box, I should add, I would never even think about looking into if this didn't happen).

I guess I don't know if this is a problem with the intake valve itself, or if it's an issue with the water supply line.

I've read online that this might be a drainage problem, but I'm not sure that is the case here. I'm basing that off of the fact that allowing time to pass doesn't increase the likelihood of hitting the sweet spot.

I bought an apartment a year ago and installed a tankless water heater. They are supposed to save on energy but consume more when the hot water is being used. 

A year and a half pass by fine and now my main electric breaker (in the power room, not ones in my apartment) is switching off. It is happening once every 2-3 days. I am not running any more stuff than i used to run before. I am actually more cautious about keeping anything running and its now switching off when the AC and the hot water is running with one light. I also feel its getting worse by the day. 

Is it possible there is something else wrong that me drawing too much energy? I ask this because the first year was fine.. 

thanks in advance. 


EDIT: following up
I checked the water heater and its 49 AMPs
the AC has a maximum of 30 AMPs
and I attacked the picture of my breaker:

What is the AMPs for my breaker? 55 or 125?

I called the company and they said the breaker could be bad and that a tech will call me back. 

So I am hoping replacing the breaker is not expensive.

I was stuck with a permanent white screen on my phone, while the phone actually still worked, the display was useless. Tried doing soft and hard resets (basically just pulling the battery) to no avail. After a ton of message board research, I came across an easy fix. 

You need to take the unit apart, something you'll need a set of small torx screwdrivers and a pry tool to do, [found here](http://www.amazon.com/Repair-Precision-Driver-Plying-Motorola/dp/B00111K6WE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315020492&amp;sr=8-2).

Simply cover the contact with a small square of electrical or duct tape and reassemble. Bam. No more white screen. 

Not sure why  this works (the OP on whatever message board I was on explained it, and it escapes me), but the problem was solved, and has been working fine for the last 6 months

The one problem we face is that the mosquitoes are incredibly thick and make it nearly impossible to sit outside in the evening. 

The back of our property has a heavily wooded area (about 100 yards away from our back porch), and in this wooded area is a low area that collects a lot of water that is about 15 feet in diameter. The property line goes almost right through the pool and the county government owns the property on the other side.

I have determined that this is likely to be where most of the mosquitoes are spawning, so I am trying to find a safe, but effective way to eliminate them. Since half of it is on county property, I likely can't make any changes to the land itself, and the area is low because the government has pushed mounds of dirt and old telephone poles into the area.

So my question is this: what would be the most effective way to eliminate the mosquitoes that are spawning there? Should I contact the county government to have them take care of the issue? Should I add some sort of larvicide to the water? Or should I try to make some minor changes to the layout to keep water from collecting there.

I am not entirely against using toxic chemicals to kill them, but I would prefer to avoid it unless a small application can go a long way without causing other harm. We have decent amount of wildlife in the area (foxes, rabbits, racoons, squirrels, etc) and I don't want to harm them. In terms of physical alterations to the landscape, I would probably not be able to do a whole lot because I don't have a lot of money or power equipment, and like I said, half of the area is owned by the county.",,False,self,t5_2rf27,False,,,True,t3_1itcud,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1itcud/safe_way_to_eliminate_a_mosquito_spawning_area/,

The spin cycle is completely out of balance and bangs against all sides of the washing machine. It's incredibly violent and loud.

This happened when we first moved into the house, and I took everything apart then. I found that my machine had a whole store of surprises for me. Instead of small springs attached at the bottom, it has long metal rods attached to springs and the basket near the bottom/midway pt. The top of the metal rods hangs out at each top corner of the basket. Nothing looked to be worn down, and in fact, the springs on the rods were in pristine condition. Everything was level. I also couldn't find any ""counter springs.""

I went ahead and reseated the rods in their spots and put everything back together with my fingers crossed...and it worked. Everything was great for about 3 months and now the problem is back.

I've got two questions: 1. Any thoughts as to what the issue is? 2. And this is embarrassing as I already figured it out once and have forgotten. Once I have the control panel off, how do I remove the metal casing or shell? This model does not have two retaining clips as outlined in every single repair video and set of instructions.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and would save my wallet some serious pain. Thank you!

EDIT:  I ended up pulling each of the four suspension rods out and examining them and they each looked to be in great shape.  Unfortunately, this seems to lead to something being wrong in the computer unit of the system.  I'm not going to try and understand this part, which will lead to...a new washing machine.  Perhaps one without all of the HE stuff that doesn't seem to do a great job at cleaning our clothes anyways.  Thanks for taking a look at this.

Basically, after living in this apartment for almost 2 years, all my light bulbs have been burning out within a very short period of time. I'd like to change them myself, but I can't figure out how to remove the cover (pics 1-4). There was a metal piece that fit around the top that I managed to remove, but that is as far as I've gotten. 


In pic 4, you can see the piece that was holding that metal ring in place. Part of that little bracket seems like it may be ""blocking"" the cover from being removed as well. I don't see how I could get it out of the way short of bending the metal, which just sounds like a bad idea.


I feel incredibly stupid/noobish asking about this, but I *cannot* seem to figure it out. I'm guessing the answer would be obvious to anyone who may read this here, but as you can probably tell I'm not very handy. This apartment is actually just a rental and I believe I could just get the live-in caretaker to change it if I really have to, but it's very difficult to arrange this schedule-wise. Tomorrow's a holiday for me so I would prefer to get it done then if possible. I have 3 big lights to change like this one, and 4 smaller kitchen lights.


You can ignore that fifth picture actually. I figure I just need to replace the whole piece. That's one of the kitchen lights.

They are storm windows, with a screen in the middle. The inside window is wood, the screen and outside glass are metal with a metal track(aluminum?). 

My concern is getting the inside window to slide up and down easily. As I said, it is glass in a wood frame, with the tracks on the side being plastic with a thin strip of metal in the center of the track.  After googling I have read the best way to do this is a silicone lubricant or rubbing an old candle on the track, but others have said this will just collect dirt and make it worse over time. 

Any advice on how to put some life back in these old windows and make them open and shut easily? Is silicone lubricant or candle wax a good idea?

I've pretty much narrowed the problem down to airflow. I'm just not sure on how to go about testing the components in the fresh food section to determine if it's a mechanical problem with the damper or if it's a thermostat problem. Any suggestions?

Edit: To clarify I'm pretty sure the airflow problem is not a defrost issue. There's no ice buildup in the evaporator area. Also, both fans are working properly. 

Edit #2: Looks like even if I did track down exactly which part was faulty the only way to buy a replacement is to get the whole $200 kit which includes the damper control and the cold controls. I'm still going to pop the assembly open first to see if it's something silly but I'm not holding my breath.

Final Edit: For future searchers who happen on this post - I thought it would be nice to edit in how I resolved it. I took the damper assembly out and didn't see anything amiss so I wedged the flap open so I could determine if doing so would lower the temperature in the fresh food section (of course don't let it run for long like this). Airflow was fine when I did this and the temperature dropped.

As I mentioned above - even if I could pinpoint the exact fault (damper, motor, cold control, capillary tube, etc.) the only replacement part that is sold for this section is a kit that contains all of these parts so for a DIY job that was my only remaining option. The part is #5304482075.

Soot has begun to form above the flame on the grating. All of the burners on my stove are having the same issue. Neither of them have had this problem until recently. The flame has always been blue.

I've had both a tech from a local company and a tech from the gas company here. The first techs told me that the regulator was the cause. It is located on the gas company's side of the meter. The gas company tech just replaced my regulator, but I am still having the same issue. I know something isn't right, because turning my fireplace fully open causes my smoke detector (not the CO detector, though) to sound.

The pilot light on my water heater is blue throughout.

Through some light reading I've learned this is caused by the gas/oxygen mixture having too little oxygen. Obviously, I'm not going to try to repair this myself. I'm looking for any other ideas, since these ""techs"" have failed to properly diagnose the cause. Someone has to have some knowledge with this.


**EDIT**: Last night at around 11pm, I checked the fireplace and stove again. The flames were as blue as blue can be. The water heater pilot was also still blue, as usual. However this morning, about 30 minutes ago at 8am, the flames of my stove and fireplace are completely orange. This is the worst I've seen them so far. I'm going to try opening a window for fresh air to see if this helps.

I now know I should have embedded it and started there.  This is the start of my nightmare.  The tiles were original to the house (1969) and were cracking and coming up without any effort.  I sped the process up by taking up the tiles, as I am needing to move downstairs due to domestic issues - which belong in another subreddit.

The bare floor now (shown in the picture) is very smooth and flat.  According to my brother (mind you, who is an electrician) said that I didn't need to put leveler on it.


A gal from the home depot-type of store showed me several options and kept telling me to do the ""self-adhesive"" stick on tile because it was fast, cheap, and I could do ten tiles a day if I wanted to.  Biggest mistake ever.

The tiles did stick initially, but the next morning the tiles were all peeled up in the corners.   We bought a compound and used that very briefly and even a couple days later, the corners are peeling up.

I am taking back the press-on stuff and not ever doing that again.  However, I am not so sure I am handy enough to do the ceramic tile/wet saw stuff.  Could someone give me some options as to what I can do?   Do I need to put something down on top of the floor first before I put anything down?  Do I go with one of the other options I was presented with - the big sheet of vinyl flooring?  Am I going to have problems with anything sticking to my floor?  If this is going to be a costly thing for me, I am more than willing to do it in stages, but I would like to get it down and moved down there as soon as possible.  

Thank you!

After the fuse is swapped out we still had no power to that section of the house. So we went and bought new fuses just to make sure the ones we had weren't bad. We pop in the new fuse and still no power. After some trouble shooting I determined that one of the mains fuses was bad so we replaced that. Still... No power. After some more trouble shooting I found that one of the lines to the mains fuse didn't have any power to it. There are four mains fuses and each of the others had power. This was determined using a no-contact meter. This is what I believe to be a typical electrical installation in the US Midwest. 

My question is; what gives? Is it possible that one of the lines from the meter to the fuse box is disconnected?

and it not just the dishwasher that has the odor. you can smell it on the dishes too. especially the plastic ones. so we bought one of these [Finish Freshening Agents](http://i.imgur.com/igSMD.jpg) hoping that it would fix the problem. after one wash, it seemed to take care of the smell. after about the third of fourth wash, my wife said that our cups and glasses has a strong cleaning solution smell to it when she drinks out of one. so i took off the Finish Freshening Agent off for the next cycle, and when it was finished, the the stinky milk odor was back.

I've since tried about three other TCONs purchased off of ebay, one didn't work, the other two exhibited the same problem. I'm thinking that although this is a somewhat widespread problem in these TVs, it's not totally likely that the two that I've tried have the exact same problem.

Others think that if it's not the TCON itself, then something is wrong with the LCD panel.

I rent a ground floor apartment that has a similar apartment above it. Being on the ground, our porch is covered by the upstairs apartment's deck. This deck has gaps between the boards of about a quarter inch. This mean that water come right through with very little to stop it.

As we pay more for a ground floor apartment for the very reason of having a ""roof"" over our porch I somewhat expect to be able to have said ""roof"" offer cover from the weather.

So I want to close those gaps in some way so that we can be outside when it's raining. We have a dog that we can't leave outside on her own per community rules (probably wouldn't want to, anyway) and we've recently started enjoying the occasional cigar.

So far I have tried two things which I didn't entirely expect to work but that were low cost and relatively easy to implement. The first was to use duct tape over the gaps. This failed in exactly the way you expect. The second try was to take a tarp and staple it up to try and funnel the water away. This failed because there is no way to attach the tarp that doesn't allow for water to pool in it which then pulls the whole thing down from the weight.

I currently have two more ideas but one of them which I know for certain will work could be more expensive than I think I can afford.

The first idea is pretty simple. I would fill the gap with something like [this GREAT STUFF™ Big Gap Filler](http://greatstuff.dow.com/products/big-gap-filler/). The only potential problems I see with this would be the color (I would probably want to get spray paint to hide it), the potential cost (I've got no idea how much I would need), and the possibility that the foam would expand up through the gap and inconvenience my upstairs neighbor.

The second idea would be to get some kind of channeling (or PVC pipe cut in half length-wise) and use something like Flex Seal to seal it over the gap. The problem I worry about here is the cost of material and, if I need to use PVC, how to get it cut as my tools are limited to things that fit in a tool bag, a Dremel, and a drill.

So basically I'm looking for advise before I try something else and potential waste more time and money.

It is usually able to catch up at night and it will be cool in the morning, but once afternoon hits then the temperature is usually 4-8 degrees hotter. 

I think I have identified some things. One, is there is a crushed duct coming from what looks like one of the intake registers. Additionally, there is some loose insulation on some of the other duct work. I am planning to get up there this weekend and try to fix up the loose insulation, feel for other holes and tape them up, and hopefully try my hand at replacing the bad duct. 


My questions are:

1. In replacing the duct, is there anything tricky to watch out for? 

2. Does my attic have adequate insulation? If not, what should I add?

3. How does my attic look for ventilation? Do I need to add more? Can I just put more on top of the existing?

4. Would a radiant barrier be a good idea/worth the money?

Other information: I live in Oklahoma so we can have very hot summers and really cold winters, rather than just always hot or always cold. My current insulation appears to be the original stuff and is about 4-5 inches deep. There are soffit vents all around and two turbines in the back. The front of the house is shaded by two big trees.

I feel pretty bad for breaking it, as I got it as a present ~ 6 years ago, for me this incident is more than the loss of a nice toy.

I'm afraid the damage done is pretty big, what would be necessary to make it work again, or is it impossible to repair?

1368428220.0,9,self.fixit,1e8dgb,What is causing repeated failures of the thermal cut-off fuse on my Kenmore clothes dryer?,Rishodi,13,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1e8dgb/what_is_causing_repeated_failures_of_the_thermal/,"I have a Kenmore elite dryer, model 110.64952300. The dryer vent is composed of a 90-degree bend at the wall, a 9' vertical run to the top of the ceiling joists, another 90-degree bend, and a 13' horizontal run through the attic to the exterior. This is the shortest venting path possible. The horizontal run and vent hood is all new as of last September. I have had the dryer since moving last year and it operated for several months before there was any sign of trouble. I have now replaced the thermal cut-off fuse twice, and it has failed for a third time as of this weekend. Before I replace it again, I want to figure out what the underlying issue is.

Each time it has failed, the drum spins and the blower operates, but as you would expect there's no heat because the circuit to the heating element is open at the blown fuse. The first failure was about four weeks ago. I tested the thermal cut-off fuse and found that it was open. I also tested the high-limit thermostat at room temperature and it was closed, so I thought the logical assumption was that the thermostat was failing to open, which then caused the thermal cut-off fuse to fail. However, I didn't test this hypothesis by heating up the thermostat and seeing if the circuit would open.

I replaced both the thermal cut-off fuse and the high-limit thermostat using the OEM parts in [this kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XLDDNI). Less than two weeks later, after only a few loads, the thermal cut-off fuse failed again. I didn't understand why, since a properly operating high-limit thermostat should prevent such a scenario from occurring, but I decided to double-check all the exhaust vents. I thoroughly vacuumed out all venting inside the dryer, replaced the transition vent from the dryer to the wall, and cut the portion of the vent which protrudes from the wall down to 3/4"" in order to facilitate air flow. Then I replaced both the thermal cut-off fuse and the high-limit thermostat for a second time.

That was two weeks ago, and now after a few more loads of clothes the thermal cut-off fuse has failed for a third time. I have no idea why. The venting is as good as it can be and the dryer was working properly for several months with the existing vent system. I don't understand how any problem other than a faulty high-limit thermostat would cause repeated failure of the thermal cut-off fuse, since those two components are in series on the same circuit and thus the high-limit thermostat should always open, cutting off power to the heating element, well before the thermal cut-off fuse fails. This time I plan on testing the thermostat thoroughly by heating it in an electric skillet to make sure that it opens as expected at the proper temperature.

Before I buy a third replacement kit, what else should I do? I've been considering buying a [wall box like this](http://www.amazon.com/EZ-Flow-Dryer-Vent-Box-Construction/dp/B001X7E9U6) to eliminate one of the 90-degree bends in the venting, but for the reasons above I'm not convinced that this would have any effect on my problem. (Nonetheless, I would be happy to take recommendations for any similar product designed to be installed in existing drywall.)

Here is a picture of the [heating element assembly](http://i.imgur.com/PiVxt1vh.jpg), and here's the [parts diagram for my model](http://www.searspartsdirect.com/partsdirect/part-model/Kenmore-Parts/Dryer-Parts/Model-11064952300/0582/0151200/P0309152/00003). I also used my camera to view the 9' [vertical run of exhaust venting](http://i.imgur.com/PUntTRTh.jpg) and the 13' [horizontal run of exhaust venting](http://i.imgur.com/eeqlS78h.jpg), both of which are clear. The heating element tests at exactly 10 ohms as it should.

**EDIT**: Additional findings so far:

* Double-checked and the voltage at the wall is 241V, so no problem there.
* I used an electric skillet to test the high-limit thermostat. It works just fine, losing continuity right at 250 degrees Fahrenheit as it should.
* There's no short between the heating element and its housing.

**EDIT 2**: I've disassembled the unit and am working on cleaning out all the lint from the motor and blower. The thermal fuse and the cycling thermostat both test OK for continuity, though I haven't heated the cycling thermostat to confirm proper operation yet. I also cut a small square hole in the drywall above the vent port to confirm that the wall it's in has 2x6 studs, and then I ordered a [Dryerbox DB-500](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AOBZTS) which will eliminate the 90-degree angle at the wall.",,False,self,t5_2rf27,1368545914.0,,,True,t3_1e8dgb,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1e8dgb/what_is_causing_repeated_failures_of_the_thermal/,

About the only prior experience I have with a non-starting car is from a dead battery, and I knew it wasn't that. I started following [this flow chart](http://www.ifitjams.com/starting.htm) and got to the part where it says to check that the spark is getting to the spark plugs. I took off the engine cover, grabbed the boot of one spark plug wire, and taped the wire down in a position where I could have a screwdriver short it out to the engine block (so I could see the spark from inside the car, as I didn't have anyone to help). To my surprise, the car started! I put it back together, and it seems to be working fine again.

Does anyone have any ideas for likely problems that could cause this? I'm not used to mechanical problems solving themselves, so I was very surprised that the car started from disconnecting a spark plug, and kept working when I put it back together. If this is something that is likely to happen again, I would like to try to find a more permanent solution so I don't end up stranded far from home with a dead car.

TL;DR: I fixed my car, have no idea how, and am trying to figure out what happened.

I have not yet found a trap\strainer that works or stays in place.  The drain is not recessed and is flush with the bottom of the sink.

Idea:

Get wire mesh to line a section of the sink bottom.  This mesh will be approx 5 inches wide and reach the tops of both walls and attach there with clips of some sort so that I can take the mesh up and throw away any thing caught in the strainer.

The first time geek squad just changed out the power supply for free and I didnt think much about it. Then the warranty ended, I didnt elect to buy another one (stupid) and then the problem resurfaced again. Since it was the same problem as last time I knew the power supply was the failing board. Looking at the board my first instincts were the capacitors. They were all made by the company ""PEACE"" except for two big cans that were made by ""AASHI"". Search Google for those name capacitors and you wont find much. Might even learn a story about bad capacitors and how there was this scientist who left a company before he was finished drawing up capacitors and the company used his incomplete drawings and made a helluva lot of terrible capacitors and flooded the Asian caps markets, where this particular power supply was built coincidentally. So I ordered about 25$ of new capacitors (Panasonic) from mouser.com and soldered them onto the board, replacing the bad caps. Working for about 3 weeks now.

To replace the entire component would have cost 80-100 dollars and no guarantee the same problem wouldn't happen again due to the use of crap capacitors.  The new capacitors cost about about 12 dollars and will, Im hoping, not fail.

Hopefully this post will be found by people using a search engine and they can save themselves some money. Because I couldn't find any answers to this problem online.

I've just moved in a new appartment and finally got to use a washing machine I had been given as 'probably working' a while ago.

From what I understand, the white-yellowish part is the water pump; it seems to be leaking from at least one point, which is the top red circle in the picture. I have no idea what that hole is for, but water drops steadily from it when there's water in the drum. I'm not 100% sure, but it seems water is coming out from the other two red circles as well.

So, how can I fix this? Is this worth fixing, or should I just get a new one? How long would it take an unperienced person to fix it if possible? What about an experienced person?

[x-post],,9,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/rqov1/how_can_i_find_a_short_on_a_circuit_in_my_house/,"* Is there a way to find an offending switch or outlet without unscrewing them from the wall one-by-one?  I found a 'troubleshooting plan' guide that suggested starting half way in to a circuit and then working toward the problem in either direction, but I don't know the path of the circuit as it includes switches and outlets in four rooms on two levels.

* If I remove a switch or outlet and leave the wires disconnected temporarily would that help prove it out, or do they need to be connected to something for the circuit to work?  Does leaving the wires disconnected cause any issues with switches or outlets after it on the same circuit?  (I should have paid attention in shop class)

* Do [outlet testers](http://www.amazon.com/IDEAL-INDUSTRIES-61-501-RECEPTACLE-TESTER/dp/B000NB85LC) work to warn of wiring faults if there is no power to the outlet?  (that sounds stupid, but I couldn't find the answer anywhere)

I have a breaker in my panel that will not reset - it trips as soon as I flip it on.  The circuit only has light switches and outlets with a few lights on it.  The switches and outlets and lights were all changed out recently by my uncle, so I'm pretty sure the wiring on one of them is wrong or loose.  He lives a ways away so I can't wait for him to be back in town any time soon to find and fix the problem.  Everything was fine for a while until a cleaning company came and I assume they plugged a vacuum or something in to one of the outlets and it tripped.  They didn't tell me about it so I don't know when or where it happened.  The breaker has two switches on it, 15 amps each, and it was the first thing that I replaced with no luck.  I tried swapping the two wires on the breaker and the problem followed the circuit going out to the house.

**EDIT: Thanks for the responses!  I got lucky and the first outlet I opened up was the culprit.  I took [a couple pictures](http://imgur.com/a/9WbQ3) where you can see the burn marks on the outlet and the ground wire touching one of the hot side screws.

I'm using Windows 7 (64-bit) with a 64GB iPod Touch (3rd gen?) with a semi-recent version of iTunes (10.4.1.10)  

**Symptoms when plugged into computer:**

* Windows instantly complains when the Touch is connected: *One of the USB devices attached to this computer has malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it...*
* Device manager displays the ! icon with 'Apple Mobile Device USB Driver'
* Properties -&gt; Device Status: This Device cannot start. (Code 10)
* **EDIT:**The Touch is listed as 'Unknown Device' on every USB port but one--where Windows ""properly"" loads the ""Apple Mobile Device USB Driver"". Likely from me manually assigning that driver when the Touch was plugged into that port a while ago. On the ports where the device is listed as 'Unknown Device', windows throws a different error code: **""Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)""**

* Properties tab for the device in the Device Manager lists the 'Hardware ids' as **USB\UNKNOWN**

* Does not show up in iTunes, even when resetting the Touch via ""power button hold down, hold home button and reconnect"" instructions
* Does not show up in 'My Computer'

**Troubleshooting:**

* Read and tried many Apple and Microsoft support recommendations to reconnect or restart various hardware or software.
* Re-installed iTunes
* Made sure the Apple Mobile Device driver is installed
* Swapped cables and computers.  No luck.

I'm not too sure what else to try at this point.  I feel like I'm so close to the problem I might be overlooking something simple.  Maybe one of you could explain what's happening or offer suggestions like I'm 5. 

If any of you have worked for apple, what would you even do with a situation like this?  I can't think of anything a store employee could do that I haven't tried on my own. It sounds like the thing might be toast.

I went through disabling various USB hubs as suggested and had to restart when I accidentally disabled my mouse.  I left the iPod Touch connected to my computer during resart and it hung at the Windows loading prompt.

I've run into an issue with starting the engine on my mower.

This is a Briggs and Straton model series 28P700 12-14hp on an 1998-ish Dixon 4423 ztr mower.

Previously, I've hardly ever had to turn the starter key for more than a few seconds, including five days ago when I last started the mower. Starts in choke, and then runs fine. Won't start in not-choke usually, unless its warm.

**What happens now:**


1. Insert, turn key to run, and everything is fine. The lights come on, as usual.
2. Turn key to crank. Starter turns the engine, with throttle in choke. Won't fire up.
3. Continue cranking, still won't start up. Battery gets tired.


I know the old 'air, fire, fuel' adage, and everything seems to be in the right place.

* I've replaced the spark plug today, which smelled of fuel, but did have some carbon black. Probably didn't need to be replaced, but its cheap. Still didn't work.

* Fresh fuel (though the tank was close to empty initially, I routinely fill it before starting). 

* The air filter could be cleaned (and will be) but its really nowhere near dirty enough to impede starting/running of the engine.

So, what could be the issue? 

There is a deadman switch on the seat which will kill the spark to the engine  so I may check that out this evening. But it cranks, so maybe that's not it...

Maybe some schmutz got in the carb? but the spark plug smelled like gas when I replaced it, and the fuel filter is clean.

I will try taking the air filter off as well to see if that will indicate the problem...


Edit: I replaced the valve-cover gasket a few weeks ago, but I've run it multiple times since then for hours with no issue. Seems unrelated to me, but maybe not.

Edit2: maybe the throttle cable is off somehow and it isn't getting into Choke like it usually requires? I'll manually set that when i get home to try it again.


EDIT3: PROBLEM SOLVED&gt; the power wire leading eventually to the magneto was pinched between the starter and block. They had been there for about a year or so, but finally gave up the ghost. The heat and pressure had essentially ironed them flat enough to pinch each copper strand in half. Ill try to post a picture after I get home.

2. I'm afraid that the pipe will eventually clog again, which makes me want to not glue it back together.  Is there a solution that will allow me to disassemble the pipes without any cutting?

I've been living at a friend's house, using his toaster and I think that I damaged it. The first time I used it, I *lightly forced* on the lever to make the bread come out (I am used to not using the eject button, even more when I'm not familiar with the device but never had any problem after using toasters for 20+ years...).
Now, the lever never stays down, but I never heard anything break at anytime. The toaster model is a Russel Hobbs 4 slice ( http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/4222808.htm ).

I then read on the internet that it was an accumulation of crumbs in the sensor and that I had to clean it. I tried blowing in there, cleaning the crumb trays. Without success, plus some metal pieces fell out of it, they are 8 of them and look like that:
http://i.imgur.com/c4WBi9p.jpg

The toaster doesn't work in the same without them... Should I try opening it? Have you already faced this problem? Solved it? Do you have any idea why these pieces are for?

I've looked through the home improvement subs and this seems to be the best place to ask.


I removed the old dishwasher today which was hardwired with hot and neutral wires running through a braided metal sleeve?.  The house was built in the 60's and back in the olden days, it seems, was ok to ground the appliance using only said metal sleeve.  Today it's no longer accepted practice.


The new dishwasher needs ground, referenced as green wire, to be screwed into the metal frame.  The metal sleeve runs to an electrical box attached to the backwall, which splits the wires then runs them to the fuse box downstairs by another metal sleeve and to a 20 amp fuse.


I see what I think is the grounding wire (silver exposed solid wire) in the metal sleeve that runs to the fusebox downstairs, however it is not connected to the second metal sleeve that runs to the machine.  To make matters worse, it's extremely short, sticks out maybe 1/5 of an inch out of the fuse box sleeve inside .


* Can I attach a ground wire to the existing one with some clamp, given that I have no wiggle room and run it directly through second sleeve to machine? 

* I would really love to avoid running a new ground wire from fuse box because I lack the experience.

* What are my options if any?

The wallmounted opener isn't lit up, almost as if there's no power getting to it. The same is true of both of the remote openers.

After a month or so last year, it start working again just as mysteriously as it had stopped. Flash forward to this year and it's happening again.

All the other lights and plugs in the garage work. The opener is mounted on the ceiling and plugs into a ceiling mounted socket. I tried flipping the breaker to the garage but that didn't work either. Is it possible it's shorting out due to the heat or something? And short of having a new opener installed, is there anything I can do besides sit here and wait, hoping that it works again?

Or even better, tell me that there's an easy, safe way to fix it myself.

The apartment I live in[I rent a condo] has one of those old style gas ranges with open gas ignition systems. The gas range is manufactured by Brown and is quite old. The gas stove burners on the top, the pilot gas burners on the top[stove] and on the bottom[oven] are working fine. [Picture of the oven's manufacturing/model plate](http://i.imgur.com/E59vHuT.jpg).

Today, I noticed that the oven did not get as hot as needed. The oven was preheated to 450F for almost 20 minutes and reached a temperature of around 150F[measured by a IR thermometer]. 

I checked the oven pilot burner in the bottom of the rage and verified that it was working. The burner for the oven[not for the stove] lit up after sometime and the flames were small[about the size of a low flame from the stove burner]. Blowing on the flames made them rise up higher[more than the size of a high flame on the stove] and made the oven heat up faster. By blowing on the oven burner for almost 10 minutes, it has now started heating up properly now.

What do you think the issue is and can I fix it by myself? If I have to call in a professional, whom should I call in [plumber, home appliance repair man etc.] and how much will it cost[approximately]?

Please let me know if any part of this is not clear and I will try my best to explain.

My neighbors reported, though there's little evidence to suggest it, that a lightning bolt struck nearby behind our home. Nevertheless, the effects of that storm left the house in a *weird* state.

But... let's start a little ways before the incident. The house was built in 1954, two bedroom, single bath. It's about 850 square feet single level, basement is the size as the uptairs but unfinished. The previous owner was, with what he did to the home being the only evidence corroborating this sentiment, a madman.

The basement was his model train workshop and home. It's a pretty standard affair. Tiling on the floor for the model train home. A workbench, pegboards, and home-made shelving (standard fair, really). Of course, if one is at the work bench, they see there's a mirror pointing to the basement door, a wooden closet door reinforced with metal beams and cabling, the door frame complete with a metal bracket on each side, looking like one could reinforce the door and its three locks with a wooden beam or broomstick. When you try to walk up the basement stairs into the house, you realize that the staircase isn't original--the space that the staircase is now used to be a broom closet. And the staircase isn't even properly built. It's wobbly, uneven, and there's little headroom (I've banged my head one too many times going up-and-down it). A certain sense exists that this man did not know a single thing about doing things himself.

And one winter, we realized that he redid the electrical work in the house himself.

We came to this realization: The dining room, living room, and both bedroom plugs were on one circuit (that ran through a standard light switch before the breaker box--we fixed that after it melted). The refrigerator and stove were on their own independent separate circuits. The plug next to the kitchen sink and the whole bathroom on another. All the lights on another in all the rooms were on one circuit. The attic had its own, as did the basement. The dryer had its own circuit, but the washer when it was upstairs was on the multi-bedroom plug circuit (so you couldn't watch TV and do a load of wash at the same time), but we moved into the basement and now it's on the standard basement circuit. There's an outdated, defunct security system on its own breaker. The electric water heater and HVAC unit have their own respective circuits.

Somehow, though, the electrical panel is filled up with switches--more switches than it appears the house needs.

So, let's go back to that lovely storm.

The house started acting weird. Weirder than usual. My fiancée came to the house, found the HVAC unit clicking on and off (resolved shortly after a round of on/offs). The stove had an alarm and it was going off. The refrigerator was humming an awful tune. The lights were three times as bright. My computer was on, the blue LED on the power button flickering and the fan slowly trying to find life. Loud relay clicks came from the TV. All in all, the house had suddenly become haunted.

I got off work, and ventured into the basement with a multimeter and a camping lantern (the basement bulbs registered a notable glow, but only to illuminate their existence, but little else) and checked the panel. Nothing was tripped. I threw all the breakers, then the main. And I threw everything back on.

The plug for the washer registed 37 VAC. That was unusual. I then checked something more sincere--the water heater. It takes 240 VAC (two poles of 120 VAC), so it'll tell me if there's anything weird. It was taking 200-odd volts from one leg, 40-odd from another--add 'em up, and we have 240 VAC.

The rest of the house confirmed this. We unplugged everything except the refrigerator--too much food to lose, and everything on a double-pole breaker acted as though there was nothing wrong, so we didn't turn the AC off--they needed 240 VAC, and they were getting it. Plus, it was 100 degrees out with a lovely level of humidity. There was no way we could subject ourselves to that.

The next morning, I tested everything again--all plugs were getting around 122 VAC. Everything seemed normal, but cautiously we didn't plug everything back in. I went to work, and asked one of the guys, a former electrician, what it could be. He stated it could potentially be a bad neutral in the breaker, probably on the main breaker. Confident that I could inspect itself, he described what to look for.

And what I was looking for wasn't there. Or rather, the neutral wasn't damaged. At all. I noticed heavy corrosion on one of the 120 VAC legs. I then started throwing breakers going breaker-to-neutral with my multimeter. The entirely mislabeled breaker box gave me no hints. I was holding an LED lantern in my teeth in total darkness playing with voltage. I discovered if I left one breaker off, everything worked fine. Everything was finely tuned to 122 VAC per leg. If I turned that breaker on, everything went 200 VAC/40 VAC. When that breaker was off, I could turn on my computer with little problem. Everything the house worked like nothing happened, but I only tried a piece at a time.

I was on to something.

But I was wrong.

I thought we had a bad breaker that pulled too much in its favor to the neutral. This breaker also had the refrigerator--the precious commodity we were so desiring. Damn heat and air, damn hot water--we needed the food. So we ran an electrical cord (after pulling out the fridge and the two dozen cat toys hidden beneath it that the cats battled with immediately--so adorable!) to the basement--the overworked living room plugs looked too sorry to play with. And we started it up. The lights immediately changed went extremely bright in some spots, dark in others. So we switched it back. And that's when it started smoking and emitting a smell that could only be found on military-grade chemical weapons.

We sealed our fate. The fridge is gone, and we can never open it again until we figure out what to do. The amperage of that compressor motor was enough to imbalance everything. My fiancée's brother claimed that the fridge was always the culprit. I have my doubts--if only because the rest of the house still operates weirdly, but not as weird, if the fridge is off.

Turning on the lights in the attic also dimmed lights elsewhere in the house. If you used something on one circuit, another circuit responded consistently: The newly founded 40 VAC went from 122 VAC to 40 VAC when we turned on a newly founded 200 VAC circuit; and vice-versa. If the circuit was known to become 200 VAC, but was reading 120 VAC, it turned 200 when a low powered circuit was energized (that is, something was plugged in or a light was turned on). There was obviously a massive imbalance.

So here comes my question: What could be wrong?

Aside from the obviously bad wiring planning that needs to be taken care of so that each breaker is taking an appropriate load, is the heavily corroded 120 VAC load a possible contender? Could be a bad neutral at the transformer? Could it have been the refrigerator all along?

Obviously--we're getting an electrician in at some point and the electric company doesn't want to talk to us either. Having said that, I just want to know exactly what is wrong with my house.

**TL;DR** My house is haunted. Half the circuits are giving too much voltage, the other half far too low. The refrigerator makes it far worse, but it's broken now.

**[EDIT 12:48 CDT] Update** -- Mario, my fiancée's former landlord, is a licensed electrician. He's out. Noted a line has fallen in the back of the house. It powers both our house and the neighbor's house--they have no power, but somewhere it's still giving us power. He suspects, however, while that's a problem, we still have faulty or otherwise bad breaker/refrigerator as a culprit. Because if the refrigerator is not plugged in, all the outlets read the same.

I suspect otherwise, however--the refrigerator might pull more amps out of the system, which in turn may imbalance the voltage load across L1 and L2. But, he is a professional and I work on water heaters over the phone for a living. And we need to get that house rewired anyway.

**[EDIT 15:02] Update** -- Mario might have been a tad too wrong. I had a feeling this would be the case. The lights started fluctuating badly, and my fiancée was smelling smoke. The basement lights were smoking. So we're back to square one. Certainly, we need a new refrigerator, but we need to get the main neutral fixed. Our neighbor has no power at all, which suggests that we're not the only one's affected by this.

**[EDIT 21:51] Update** -- Some guy from North Carolina in a pick-up truck, representing some company unbeknownst in our neck of the woods, rolled up and asked if we were having electric panels. We replied, dryly, ""Maybe."" We explained the situation, and in a few minutes, 4 bucket truckets swarmed our house--in short time, our neighbor's powerline was restored and our loose main was reconnected. Everything is working in the house, save a few casualties.

We've lost the refrigerator, a very expensive coffee pot, the surge protector to my computer (which once plugged back in, refused to acknowledge that it was receiving power--a sure sign it wasn't meant for this world), a toaster that sparked violently once reintroduced to electricity, our microwave (though it still works, a good series of buttons have inexplicitly stopped working), and a veritable host of lightbulbs.

1335228084.0,8,self.fixit,sp49d,Update: Furnace motor replacement,unsailedbard,9,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/sp49d/update_furnace_motor_replacement/,"**TL;DR** *Thank you, Fixit!  With your help, I replaced the blower fan motor in my furnace and repaired my first household appliance.*  

I just wanted to say thank you to the Fixit community for helping me replace the electric motor for the blower fan in my furnace.  I [originally posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/rgj1m/how_much_damage_would_detergent_oil_do_to_a_motor/) to ask for information regarding the effects of a lubricating oil with detergents on a motor which called for a non-detergent oil.  The help I received from **mbstang**, **itx** and **Seige9929** confirmed my suspicions that the motor bearing had failed and the motor would need replacing.  They pointed me towards the next step to replace the motor, and their confirmations gave me the confidence I needed to tackle it.

After a failed attempt to find a proper replacement motor at my nearest HVAC Supply, the owner pointed me to a local shop that specializes in electric motors of all shapes and sizes.  Now, all I had to do was get the motor out of the furnace so they could identify a replacement.

Getting the motor out was a slightly difficult.  My furnace uses a ""direct-drive"" motor instead of a ""belt-driven"" motor, which means that the blower fan is mounted directly to the driveshaft instead of linked together using a belt.  This meant that the motor didn't want to leave the furnace without taking the blower fan with it.  After I turned off the furnace at the fuze box, I pulled out the motor, blower fan and mounting bracket in one piece, and then disconnected the wires connecting the motor to the control circuit inside the furnace.

After removing the blower fan and mounting bracket, the owner of the motor shop found the exact specs for my motor stamped on to the outside of the casing.  He then sold me a new motor for $120, which was a fraction of the cost to have the furnace repaired by a contractor.  A couple of quick tips on what *not* to do when connecting the wiring, and I was headed back home.

Once home, I reattached the blower fan and mounting bracket, then installed the motor back in to the furnace.  Next came the wiring.  I'm pretty terrified of being electrocuted, so I took my time comparing the wiring diagram on the inside of the furnace with the control circuit.  After I was positive I had identified everything from the diagram, I started to plan my attack.

The old motor was so ancient, it didn't use the same color coding for the wires as the replacement motor or the furnace.  Both motors were ""multi-speed"", and I had identified the proper connections for the speed controls.  The problem came when I wanted to supply the current to the motor.  With modern color coding, Black and Red are ""hot"" lines, Green is ground and White is for the ""common"" or return path.

The old motor used a black wire to connect to the ""hot"" black wires of the control circuit, which seemed to make sense.  The replacement motor used a black wire for the fastest speed control, and it wanted me to use the white ""common"" wire to connect to the current.  So, here I was connecting a white wire to a black wire, where previously a black wire had been connected to a black wire.  I was not happy.

After calling my girlfriend's father, who is an electrician, I eventually worked out that this was correct.  Rather counter-intuitively, the hot line connected to the return path on the motor, because the motor was the ""end-of-the-line"" for the current and so technically it was the return path.  The old motor was so old that the return line was colored black, as thats how things were done back then, apparently.

After flipping the breaker back on, I tried to start the fan.  You could hear it click on, but nothing happened.  A little worried, I turned the breaker off again, when I had the idea to manually spin the fan with my fingers.  Sure enough, it was barely moving, like it was stuck on something.  Aha!  I had mounted the blower fan too far on the driveshaft, and it was getting caught on the housing.  I pulled the whole thing out, adjusted the placement of the blower fan on the driveshaft, put it back in and started it up.

Success!!  Crisp, cool air started blowing strongly around the house, and I couldn't help but feel like [Tom Hanks in Castaway](http://gifsoup.com/view1/1803479/i-have-made-fire-o.gif).  I spent the rest of the weekend enjoying my circulated air while grunting manly, self-satisfied grunts.

Thanks again, Fixit!  You saved me hundreds of dollars and helped awaken my internal handy-man.  I couldn't have done it without you!

PS Seige9929:  I discussed the possibility of replacing the bearing in the old motor, but the shop owner said that the motor was so old that it used a sleeve bearing, which requires custom fitting the driveshaft by boring out the bearing till you got the right fit.  He didn't recommend it, although I'll still be disassembling the old motor anyway, just for fun.",,False,self,t5_2rf27,False,,,True,t3_sp49d,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/sp49d/update_furnace_motor_replacement/,

My house was built in 1953, and has an addition that was built sometime in the 1990s. Where the power meets the house, there's a large breaker box with the meter on one side, and a row of breakers on the other. One is the main breaker, one goes to the a/c unit outside, one goes around the house to the addition (which has its own breaker panel inside), one goes inside the house to a screw-in type fuse panel, and one breaker goes to an opening in the wall near the panel and is apparently connected to the outlets &amp; lights I am having a problem with.

For the past few months we've had low voltage (like 83v) at these affected outlets and lights, and I've been opening every switch, outlet, and ceiling light looking for loose or broken wires. I didn't find any, but anywhere I found wires crimped together, I cut the crimp off, stripped the wires and twisted and capped them. This didn't help the low voltage problem. I replaced every switch and outlet that was affected -- no change. I tested every circuit in the fuse panel inside the house, and there were I believe 2 circuits in the house that were affected with the low voltage. I even took as much of it apart as I could and cleaned all the contacts with sandpaper -- no change. I even opened up that other small box outside where it goes into the wall. There were wires twisted together but it looked kinda ratty so I unhooked it all, cleaned everything, and retwisted them and capped them. I am 100% sure I did not reverse the pairs of wires. All the other outlets work fine and have full power. This one breaker (120v 20A) outside seemed to be the culprit so I replaced it and everything seemed to be working great again, until tonight.

Apparently the GFI outlet in the bathroom quit working right and was putting a load on the circuit (broken test button), and using the cooktop was tripping that breaker, so I took the outlet out and replaced it with a regular non-GFI outlet (yeah I know, but we don't use this bathroom for anything at all, I'm not worried about it not being GFI for the time being). That fixed that problem, but now I have an even bigger problem. I have no idea how this came to be.

When that breaker is turned ON, *the electrical meter turns off*, the outlets &amp; lights that are connected to it don't work at all (no voltage at all), but everything else in the house is fine. When the breaker is OFF, everything I was previously having a problem with works fine (107-109v at the outlets), BUT then my cooktop/fridge/other stuff doesn't work at all. It doesn't make any sense at all.  I checked the fuse panel in the house and there's no blown fuses or loose wires or anything.

Is it possible that the wires in that box going into the wall are backwards? I only uncapped one pair at a time specifically so I wouldn't mix them up. What would happen if I reversed them? 

Here's a drawing of the house and the affected outlets and stuff:

[http://i.imgur.com/2a18w.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/2a18w.jpg)

the green marks are good working lights and outlets, and the red ones are of course the bad ones that aren't working at all at the moment

I can take pictures if it'd help at all.
----------------------------------------------


FINAL UPDATE -- Duke Power came out and I explained the problem to the guy. He tested the incoming power at the main breaker, and determined that the problem was definitely on their side. He got up in his bucket and checked out the connections, and found out that the problem was a bad transformer and crimps that had been severely damaged by squirrels. [He replaced the entire transformer and put new wires and crimps on](http://i.imgur.com/DfDBR.jpg), and everything works great now. No dim lights or low voltages anywhere anymore.

We bought this townhouse in December.  Our home inspector saw there was a pretty bad mold issue in the attic.  As part of the offer, the previous owner had it taken care of to the satisfaction of our home inspector.

The mold cause is up in the air.  While our home inspector said it was likely a ventilation issue, the condo corporation told me recently that the previous owner was at fault with a pretty bad bathroom vent installation.  Details on this are sketchy, but the rep told me there was a hole that was cut too big in the bathroom ceiling (I can see evidence that this has been repaired with plaster), and that the vent was not connected properly in the attic.

Once I heard this I took a look and saw what is pictured.  It is wrapped in insulation and tuck tape.

My house was without water for the last two days due to a broken bathtub faucet.  While the water was off, I tried to jerry-rig a siphon from a 5-gallon bucket perched on top of the bathroom sink to refill my toilet tank without having to lift and pour a heavy bucket of water every time.  The bottom of the bucket lines up pretty well with the normal water level in the tank, so I thought that the siphon would stop when the water was at an appropriate level.  I used a thin tube taped at the bottom of the 5 gallon bucket on one end, and right next to the water inlet of the toilet tank on the other.

The siphon worked fine, but the flow through was several times slower than what goes into the toilet tank with house pressure.  However, what ended up happening was that the toilet bowl filled to the right level, but the flapper did not close to fill the tank. Instead, the remainder of the bucketful of water just drained through the toilet.

The problem was not running out of water, or a leaky flapper (just tested with food coloring in the tank).  Can anyone think of why the toilet tank would function incorrectly with a low flow rate from the 1/8"" or so tubing?",,False,self,t5_2rf27,False,,,True,t3_q083v,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/q083v/plumbing_physics_question/,

Repair or replace?  ,jugglinglivebabies,8,0,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/payel/dryer_is_dead_repair_or_replace/,"Hey Fixit, I hope you can help.  I've got a washer/dryer set that the builder threw in when we bought our first house.  This was just under six years ago.  Within the past month or so, the dryer has started acting strange.  When we ran the timed dry cycle, the timer would start audibly ticking even before we started the dryer.  i thought maybe it was normal, just the timer was getting louder with age.  but then it started to continue ticking, and the timer dial would continue to move after the cycle was over even though the tumbler stopped.  i'm also fairly certain that the heating element stayed on.  to rememdy this i would just manually turn it to the auto sense cycle and it would stop.  then, the other night, we did our normal laundry day (family of six, laundry day is literally laundry DAY).  My stuff was last through, and I usually just put it on the sense cycle before i go to bed.  When I wake up, I usually put it on a 30 minute timed cycle just to fluff everything up.  When I tried doing that the next morning, it wouldn't turn on.  The heating element turned on, I could feel that, and I could hear the timer ticking, but the power button wasn't doing anything.  So now I'm wondering if six years is a decent lifespan for an economy brand dryer (estate by whirpool), and if it would even be worth sinking money into repairs.  Or should I just try to find an inexpensive stand-in off craigslist.  We don't really have the $ for anything new thanks to the transmission going out on the family vehicle a few months back.  Also, the washer still works perfectly.  

**TL;DR  6 year old dryer won't start, but still heats up.  Should I spend money on repairs or buy one used on CL?  Thanks, Fixit!**

**EDIT: UPDATE!  turns out the husband of my wife's friend is a sears repairman, so he came over and replaced the element.  the element heated up too much and warped, so the coils were touching the metal frame.  this caused the element to short out and also blew the fuse.  $110 later and i'm drying clothes like a champ.  thanks for the tips, fixit!  without you guys, i probably would have just bought some used clunker off craigslist.**",,False,self,t5_2rf27,True,,,True,t3_payel,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/payel/dryer_is_dead_repair_or_replace/,

We've got a finished basement with laminate floors, and in the past few months (since March? maybe earlier), I've noticed wet spots around my basement. Thought it was my cats, because the spots REEK of this urine like smell...but after further investigation, I can't really say it is. Most telling ones: UNDER my elliptical and under the couch against the wall (3in space... my cats are big so they wouldn't be able to fit under there even if they tried).  There are also wet ""streaks"" down these paper curtains the previous owners had installed.  All of the spots have been near the walls themselves and not in the center of the room.  No leaky spots from the ceilings.  I've never seen the walls be damp, but then again I've never stared at them and they don't have water streaks like the paper curtains.

In any case, we've since cleaned the basement floor to get rid of the smell and it worked for like a day, but after a day or two, the smell is back (and no wet spots). It's actually worse and doesn't go away even after cleaning. Thought it was my kitty litter, but that gets cleaned daily anyway and doesn't smell like that at all.

One of the worst wet spots had made the laminate floor pop up a lil near the edges.  Seemed some of the smell got worse getting near the sump pump. Started thinking it was that, but that looks bone dry with cobwebs and everything (dirt at the bottom too maybe? Was hard to tell since I don't know what its supposed to look like normally). There are a couple of cracks in the drywall at the edges and one of the end pieces of laminate next to the basement sliding door is split.

The previous owners had finished the basement on their own.  There is a piece of plastic like thing between the laminate and the concrete floor (guessing it was -- according to google searching -- maybe like a polyethylene membrane?). We've also got interior french drains. We've got an outdoor drain from/for the sump pump. 

Right outside our basement, we've got a bit of a sloped hill that levels out onto the patio... Clogged gutters caused a lot of runoff from that area, but since we got the gutters cleaned last month, that hasn't really been an issue. 

So I'm thinking it's probably mildew or mold growing... Could it  have been caused by rain/bad runoff that got inside the basement (thru the sump pump drain?)  How do I check for this? How do I get rid of that mildew? Do we have to tear up the floors and walls? 

Any help is greatly appreciated!  Thanks.

EDIT: we bought a black light to check around the area to make sure it wasn't the cats. Sadly cat waste (hairball, vomit, pee) and mildew/mold both show up as neon yellow green. 

We also checked to see if sump pump is working properly but can't remove pit lid. We did try to lift the handle (there is no float?) but that didn't budge.

Hey all,

We just moved into this house maybe 2 weeks ago, and yesterday our oven (Model FEF376ASH) went out on us.  What happened was I had the broiler turned on, and shortly after I shut the oven door I heard a pop and saw a bit of a flash, and now my bake/broil elements wont turn on.  

I took off the metal panels on the back of the oven and saw that the wire connected from the control board to the broiler element had apparently come loose and fallen off, touched the back metal panel, and arced off it.  There are black scorch marks to prove that as well on the wire and on the metal panel.  

From what I can tell, the [control board](http://www.searspartsdirect.com/partsdirect/part-number/Frigidaire-Parts/Range-Parts/316207507/0022/628/Model-FEF376ASH/1428/0124111?keySuffixId=NA&amp;pathTaken=partSearch&amp;pathRender=modelComponent&amp;documentCompId=R0302041&amp;diagramPageId=00001&amp;productTypeId=0124111&amp;searchModelNumber=FEF376ASH&amp;subCompDesc=Backguard&amp;brandDesc=FRIGIDAIRE&amp;modelDesc=ELECTRIC%20RANGE&amp;blt=11&amp;shdMod=FEF376ASH&amp;keyId=20) itself is what is broken, but I just want to see if anyone can offer me some more opinions or perspectives before I order a $100-150 part.  Plus this is my first time taking apart an oven. 

Can anyone offer me some advice?  I can post pics this evening if they are required.  

Update:  It worked!  Used [this part](http://www.laptopsforless.com/appliancecontrolboard/frigidaire-range-various-controlboard=316207507r) and checked temps with my Maverick ET732 and it stabilized at whatever temp I set it to.

The water pressure coming out of my kitchen faucet has decreased, both hot and cold. I think it's been happening over the last two weeks or so, but I just returned from a four day vacation and it's noticeably worse than before I left.  It's as if I'm trying to use the kitchen faucet while the shower and garden hose are on full blast.

About three weeks ago I removed the regulator from my shower head.  I don't necessarily think it's related, but the timing of both events coincides, so it may be relevant.  That same week I filled a 4,000 gallon above ground pool in my back yard, but I don't see how that'd be related.  It's not connected to my plumbing, it's just a [bag of water](http://www.intexcorp.com/old_site/images/AGP/12x36.jpg).

All other faucets seem normal, including the shower (meaning that today it's the same flow rate as the day I removed the regulator).  I don't see any leaks.  House built in 1973.

Any ideas?  I'm not afraid of plumbing and can roll up my sleeves and get this resolved, but I don't have much of an idea where to start on this one.  Thanks for any suggestions or insight.

But i'm currently at kind of a standstill.  The main switch to turn on the machine works just fine but i can't get it to play anything. In order to get the cylinder to start rotating i sometimes need to slowly rotate it by hand but it's able to do it on it's own after that but as soon as i place the needle down the cylinder completely stops. My father says he's tried different needles in the past and recently, i had one of the parts replaced (believe it is called a stylus. but i call it a needle in the video lol) 

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_l56BPis8o Here's a video if that helps. 

I'd be extremely grateful for any sort of help. Please let me know if you need to see more video or pictures. Thanks in advance!


UPDATE:

I revieved this e-mail from Antiquephono early this morning.
 
""It's very difficult to diagnose a problem without actually seeing the machine.  Your youtube video clearly demonstrates the problem but unfortunately can provide no clues as to the solution.  In the video you mentioned that you had the ""needle"" (actually called a stylus in these types of machines) replaced.  Although the stylus has nothing to do with your current problem, I'd recommend taking the machine to whomever did the stylus replacement for you for a diagnosis of your problem.  (By the way, the reproducer weight is indeed supposed to be loosely mounted as you show in the video.)

Failing that, here are a few possible contributing factors to the problem:

1) Belt: This should be leather; not too tight but not too loose.  A rubber band will often cause the problem you have.  There is also an idler wheel below the bedplate that applies pressure to the belt.  This should be freely rotating.

2) Half-nut &amp; spring:  At the rear of the carriage (the part that holds the reproducer) is a flat metal bar (called the half nut spring) with a threaded half-nut attached. This must be adjusted so that the half nut engages the feedscrew but without too much pressure on the half nut spring.  One your model, this spring is carefully bent by hand.

3) Mainspring: You should be able to wind the crank 30-35 rotations from a relaxed mainspring.  The machine will not play properly without enough tension on the mainspring - that is, fully wound.

*(already tried cranking it to no avail)

4) Lubrication: This is self-explanatory.  All points of movement need a small drop of quality oil (sewing machine oil is best).  If the mainspring ""thumps"" while running, the graphite inside had hardened into a pasty consistency.  Ideally, the mainspring should be disassembled, cleaned, lubricated, and reassembled, but this is a job for the experienced.

*(no thumping noise from what i can tell)

I note that your machine is equipped with a 4-Minute Attachment.  Originally, your machine was manufactured (1903-05) to play 2 minute cylinders only.  When 4 minute cylinders were introduced in 1908, attachments were provided so older machines could play both types of record.  Your reproducer is a Model C (shown by the holes in the weight) which is a 2 minute reproducer.  That means that the selector knob on your 4-Minute Attachment (the cluster of gears on the top left side of your machine) must be pushed in, or toward the right side of your machine.  This suggests, of course, that your record must be a 2 minute as well.  The cover to your 4-Minute Attachment can be readily removed by loosening one of the screws on the side.  Making sure these gears are clean and properly lubricated will help ensure good performance from your machine.""",,False,self,t5_2rf27,1366989615.0,,,True,t3_1d4lh1,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1d4lh1/trying_to_fix_up_this_old_cylinder_phonograph/,

The receiving piece of the clean out on the right has a bunch of small cracks, probably from over tightening in the past.  Now it leaks a bit.

 Any clever ideas on how to fix it without tearing open the wall?  I'm thinking a bit of ABS glue on the outside (to seep into cracks) and a pipe clamp around it might work. 

Any better ideas?


Update:

I crawled under and found that the drain end of this pipe is capped about 2 feet in.  WTF?

So the remaining question is what the vertical from that cleanout goes to, and where the water is coming from.  My best guess is rain water.  It could be hooked up to the vent line, which is letting water get in?

I took a picture of the vent.  I can not tell if that little jacket is a cap or just some sort of deflector.  Can anyone tell me?

I have this Samsung Plasma 42"" 720p (Model #: PN42C450B1D). My brother's friend found it being thrown out and wanted to see if I could fix it. I immediately thought it may just be blown capacitors, but when I took off the back to investigate, I did not see any capacitors that looked bad/bulging. I also have not seen (though need to look more thoroughly) any scorch/burn marks.

So essentially, I am trying to figure out where the fault is and if it will be salvageable.

Weird thing is, the power board appears to be getting power as indicated by my AC voltage detector. However, there is no clicking going on and no LED or lights that turn on.

What is really strange is, if I leave the TV hooked up with just a power cord and apply my AC Voltage Detector to the chassis (metal framing) or anywhere on the TV, it goes off. However, as soon as I plug my HDMI cord from the TV to my laptop, the AC Voltage Detector stops going off.

Is that normal? Or could it be an indication of improper grounding/short? 

I am not dead-set on getting this device to work, but playing around and trying to fix electronics is always interesting.

Thanks for your help! If you need any pictures/further info, please just ask!

**EDIT:** Upon further review, it does seem that there is a fuse missing. It requires a 3.15A 250V fuse. I'll have to wait to pick one up from RadioShack tomorrow, but until then could someone answer the following: What is the difference between slow and fast fuses? Also, is there an advantage going with ceramic over glass fuses? It appears the power board used ceramic, but I was not sure if so long as the rates are the same, if I could use a glass one without issue.

I would prefer Main Bathroom, Shower Stall, the Bathroom Fan.  The big problem is (a) I'm a bit of a newbie to electrical, (b) there's not enough slack in the wires just to pull them out and re-arrange them, and (c) I'm not sure if they have to be daisy-chained in any particular order.

The Bathroom Fan (C) is daisy-chained to the Main Bathroom Light (B) with a short black wire along the bottom.  Then (B) is daisy-chained to the Shower Stall Light (A) with a short-wire along the bottom.  This can be seen in this second picture.  [From Above](http://i.imgur.com/0nYPC)

I then plugged the refrigerator back in and set the temps to the medium setting. Everything was good for about 6 hours then I noticed it doing the leaking of water drip by drip into the freezer again!

I selected white OSI Quad as my replacement material since I knew it was an industry standard and would have no problem adhering to the substrates in question, brick and vinyl.  I am very experienced with using DAP Alex Plus on the interior side of my windows (and very nearly everywhere else inside my house), but I was unprepared for how messy it was to handle an exterior product.  My Fein MultiMaster w/ scraper blade made short work of the old caulk (thank science!), and scraper blades are astonishingly inexpensive on Amazon right now, so I decided to work on the rest of my windward windows.  I have 5 more to restore, all vinyl surrounded by brick, and some below steel lintels.  Before I continue I have these questions five:

* I have a septic system and was pretty concerned about cleaning my equipment after the job, and in the end just tossed the knife I used to draw final beads.  Does anyone have a suggestion about how best to clean OSI Quad off of one's hands and tools without putting anything that is not septic safe down the drain?

* I tried to tape the brick before applying the OSI but a fair amount of overdraw happened behind the tape.  Furthermore the product became tacky so quickly that removing the tape messed the job up pretty good and I had to touch some areas up without tape, which further exacerbated the overdraw.  Is there a solvent or cleaning procedure I can use to minimize the product a bit back toward my original line?  I'm not really picky about this, and can't be since I would be trying to clean the product off of brick and mortar, already a fool's errand, but if there is something easy I would appreciate knowing about it.

* After removing the old caulk there were some pretty significant gaps around my windows, particularly behind the angled brick sills.  I filled the spaces completely, but I am concerned that due the pretty significant expected shrinkage of the product it might not occupy the space well.  When I encounter similar gaps again should I use a spray foam to fill the gaps and just caulk the surface?  I have never been impressed by the water management properties of spray foam, particularly the non-expanding door-and-window stuff, so I try to avoid it unless my caulk cracks in front of an opening.  What is the right way to resolve this kind of issue?

* Should I use clear OSI Quad to caulk the mortar between and around my angled brick sills?  They are angled down a bit and I live in an area with low humidity and which doesn't get much rain.  Snow never sits on the sills either.  The bricks and mortar on my sills still looks great after 50 years, but I have read some articles saying that mortared joints on non-continuous sills can be a big entry point for water.

* Finally I am wondering if I should consider using a different product that cleans up more easily and/or shrinks less.  Some of the newest products seem attractive but I worry about how well they will hold up to the test of time.  It is easy to find anecdotes about every product on the market which say either that the product holds up great or that it fails in a couple of years.  OSI Quad is kind of a battleship in this regard but I would hate to miss out on something much better just because I didn't ask.  OSI Advantage seems to have been pulled off the market at some point and people seem to be backing away from recommending DAP Sidewinder lately, so it looks like tried and true may be the way to go here.  I would love to hear the opinion of someone with lots of experience with exterior restorations and how they hold up.

I mean, I *really* hope you guys can help.

Last week, the freezer compartment froze over to the point where the door wouldn't close. I grabbed a hammer and went to town on the iceberg. It...was...**awesome**. Ice flying everywhere. Sweat flying everywhere. The Ice Man cometh, indeed.

By the time I was done, I had more room in my freezer compartment than I had in months. I put in my two frozen chicken breasts (heh) and washed my hands of a job well done. 

I spent the weekend at my girlfriend's house. When I got back home today, I opened my mini-fridge and found that most of the remaining ice in the freezer compartment had melted away. There's *barely* any ice in there now, certainly much, much less than the ice I had left after I went all Hammer of the Gods on it last week. 

Also, the items in my fridge feel... not cold. Not warm, but my milk isn't as nice and chilled as it normally is. My butter isn't the solid rock that it normally is. 

I'm worried that in the process of hacking away at the ice in the freezer compartment, I may have done something to have damaged the cooling for the rest of the appliance. The electronics are still working - the mini-fridge is still making all the noises I associate with it (the light is out, but it has been for a while, long before this thing started). 

So...any ideas? You guys have Fry ""Fix it!"" video in your sidebar, so I'm expecting a miracle or two.

I looked at the breaker itself and it's a 30amp breaker, which is what my dryer is rated for.

After looking at the plug itself, it looks like part of the grounding plug is kind of melted, which probably happened when I first plugged it in: http://imgur.com/31A3U

**EDIT**

I just got done talking with someone from a very helpful repair company that walked me though some troubleshooting tips.

The following trips the breaker:

* Right terminal unplugged
* Left terminal unplugged

The following DOES NOT trip the breaker:

* Left and right terminals unplugged

* All terminals plugged in, but door open and dial set to off

* All terminals plugged in, door closed, dial set to Air fluff (dryer does not come on though)

I of course threw the receipt away before checking that it worked, so no refund or replacement.. I just want to know if there's a simple way for me to make it work.

Caveats:

* I know next to nothing about electronics
* I have a very limited tool set (screwdrivers and that's about it)

[Pics](http://imgur.com/a/6zjs5)

It's 12V, and I guess the circuit board is meant to stop the charging once the battery is full. The green diode lights up once it's connected to the 12V, and I think the red is meant to light up while it's charging (though the manual says it's supposed to be the opposite). The red diode lights up for a fraction of a second when I attach it to the battery but doesn't stay lit. And, of course, the battery doesn't charge.

Please ask if you want me to provide further details, but I'm not able to do things like measure voltages etc.

Could I, for example, just rip out the circuit board and connect the 12V directly to the battery without making it explode?

I have acquired a new table but one of the legs needs some repairs.  As you can see in the pictures, the previous owner tried to repair it themselves with some small screws, but I intend to try and repair this to more original quality standards.  The tabletop is very heavy for the size, so I'm guessing it's made of MDF.

I tried installing some new thread inserts but the laminate had definite damage from the previous strain, and around the 3 stripped holes the tabletop material is bulging slightly (you can see in the below pictures), so the strength is somewhat compromised even though the new thread inserts I bought have larger outer threads.

First picture is of the thread inserts that used to be in these holds (left, brass coloured) and the new ones that Home Depot carried, as well as the bolt/washers I have (I had to buy those, they couldn't find the originals).  They are the same thread size (5/16"") and the same diameter at the widest end.  The old ones are of a tapered shape, the new ones have a slightly larger thread diameter overall.

I noticed that my heater seemed to be struggling to match the thermostat setting lately ([I'd set it at 73 and it'd hover around 71, for example](http://i.imgur.com/qpckSh.jpg)) so I went downstairs to look.

There are [2 LED lights inside the panel that I assume are diagnostic lights. One is flashing](http://i.imgur.com/GvThbh.jpg). Here are the details:

The furnace is a [Lennox G60UHV(X) Series](http://i.imgur.com/UNeCGh.jpg).  I have a copy of the manual which has the full name on it, [here's a picture of the cover](http://i.imgur.com/2XVoFh.jpg).

There's [a sticker on the front panel of the furnace that shows a big list of diagnostic codes](http://i.imgur.com/T0MDih.jpg) relating to the flashing lights.

The left light stays off and the right light is flashing pretty quickly, more than once per second. I believe that [this picture shows the correct diagnostic code from the sticker](http://i.imgur.com/q4yBeh.jpg).

If that's the case, I'm guessing it's one of 4 things from the diagnostic sticker:

* the pressure switch is open; or
* there's a blocked inlet/exhaust vent; or
* the condensate line is blocked (for condensing furnaces only); or
* the pressure switch closed prior to activation of combustion air inducer.


I don't know what any of these things mean. If anyone can give some pointers I'd really appreciate it.

Is this something I can fix, or a friend can fix if they have moderate knowledge of furnaces/ducts? Is one of the things from the list much more likely, or very easy to check myself? Or do I just need to call a professional?

The house does stay warm enough that this isn't a big problem yet. That light may have been flashing for a few weeks for all I know and I only recently noticed it.

Does it have anything to do with the engine lever ? The one that has to do with the speed of the engine or whatever it is. It's reluctant to start no matter what position that lever is in , but should i try and start on low , and turn up to high ?

I suspect it's mold under the cabinets. I think there is a leak somewhere under the cabinet in the drain line. When I had the inspection done the inspector made not that there must have been a leak under the sink at one time because of the damage done to the the inside bottom of the cabinets.

In the pictures I've shared below you can clearly see how the baseboard is all warped. When the inspection was done there was no musty smell but after a few days of using the sink the smell started. I suspect the drain line is leaning somewhere under the baseboard. My guess would be that joint just above the baseboard. In picture 2 you can clearly see how this joint extends below the trim piece where the board used to be attached to. My guess is this was the repair that was done. Why exactly is there that Y fitting there instead of just a straight pipe?

Does the plumping job here seem correct? I see a mix of plastic shut offs and metal shut offs. I plan on replacing all the plastic shut off's with metal once since the plastic ones are prone to leaking. In picture 1 why is there a plastic shut off there however you can see that line makes a 90 degree turn to another line that has another shut off higher. Why is it done like this? To me this kind of looks like a shit plumbing job. How does the drain trap look to you? To me it looks like it would be difficult for water to actually wash through however I haven't noticed draining problems yet but I haven't really used the sink all that much because of the smell and the fact that we still have tons of unpacking to do.

My plan is to cut a small 2in circle hole in the baseboard in a few areas using something like this http://www.professional-power-tool-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/drill-bits-hole-saw-275x300.jpg to inspect the inside of the baseboard for mold as well as under the baseboard.

I've got a 3 zone HVAC system in my home. Until a few days ago, the zones were managed by a Honeywell EMM-3 Mini Zone Controller. The other day, I woke up to discover the upper level at a comfortable 72 degrees, the main level at 65 degrees, and the finished basement at a chilly 60! I immediately suspected the zone controller, since regardless of thermostat setting (including OFF), cold air was blowing in all 3 zones.

When I pulled the cover off the controller panel, I spotted some scorch marks on the circuit board, directly above what looks like a large resistor. This leads me to believe that it has fried out, probably during some severe storms we've had recently.

It appears that the EMM-3 has been discontinued, so I'm looking for a replacement. It looks like something from Honeywell's HZ series is probably what I need, but I'm looking for a little confirmation before I purchase one.

I am on the right track? Do I need 2 stage, or is 1 stage sufficient? How do I know?

It's got a 17hp intek engine and about 560 hours run time.  
If it helps model # is, 17BA5A4G709.  
It's had a slow oil leak that to my understanding isn't new and I've put about 8-10 hours on it since it became mine. I've had to add about 1 ounce of oil per hour to keep it topped off.
The last time I ran it the oil line that goes to the fuel pump popped off and after I figured out what the deal was and reconnected it started choking when I had the pto engaged, blowing white/bluish smoke and oil was bubbling out of the fuel pump.  
A google search lead me to believe that was a blown head gasket, so I ordered a new one (will be here tomorrow) and started watching videos on how to change one.  
I have very little experience with this sort of stuff and am kind of learning as I go, but I'm also poor/on a very limited budget so I literally cannot afford to pay anybody to fix anything so I have to learn how to do it myself :-D  
I removed the head from the mower and made sure to keep inventory of all my bolts/nuts etc. and in what order they go back in on.  
I noticed a couple things. The bits of the gasket crumbled apart when I removed it, so I think I was right about the gasket problem. There's burnt crunchy oily looking shit on the piston but it doesn't look too thick, just a thin layer. Reminds me of what you see on a grill after cooking burgers. Do I need to remove that? If so what's the proper way to do it?  
Inside of the head there's two chambers, one has two long bars in it. inside of that chamber there's some cracking.

A few days ago I asked for help with repairing my dishwasher. You guys were able to help me and my dishwasher works again!

But I have another dishwasher problem now...It appears that a few months ago when the technician came by (he's the one that broke it in the first place!), it looks like he used the wrong screw to re-attach the bottom panel of the dishwasher. The issue is that the screw actually screwed in to the plastic basin of the dishwasher.

Now that the screw was removed to repair the motor, there is a tiny hole that is leaking water. This hole is in the bottom corner of the door. I'm thinking that some epoxy paste or glue or something can do it, honestly the hole is the size of a pin-head and in the corner of the unit.

It's possible that simply putting the screw back will plug the hole, but I want a backup plan. Would you have any suggestions on how to plug a hole in plastic that would be waterproof and potentially heat proof (since hot water and a heating element are nearby in the dishwasher).

We recently moved into a condo. The unit is on the top floor, and the entire area is at a pretty high elevation (top of the hill, can see the town/city). We've been here for nearly a month, with no problems.

However, the other day, we woke up in the middle of the night from a terrible stench. At first, I thought there may be a dead animal in the walls, or worse- a dead body in the unit below. The smell was brutal.

After some poking around, I found it was coming from the bath and sink drains, throughout our home. The unit is in good shape, but it's been unoccupied for over a year. I figured the water in the traps evaporated- and perhaps adding water somehow made it smelly. I tried all the standard DIY fixes: bleach, vinegar, baking soda, hot water, etc (in no particular order). Nothing. Still awful.

Long story short, the condo association sent out a plumber, in fear of methane/sewer gas. The plumber explained it could be the following:

1. High altitude in a windy area, exhaust vent on roof could be installed wrong. Therefore, wind is blowing in and moving the air around- and could even dry out the p-traps.
2. Crack in the a pipe, between my unit and the unit below.
3. P-traps are done wrong
4. Toilet is loose. If the wax ring isn't creating a good seal, the effect is similar to #1. Air gets in, moves around- stinky air ensues.
5. Dead animal in the walls, or dead body below. He said he always starts at the toilet, with sewer gas.

Turns out, the toilet did need a new wax ring, and was wobbling all over the floor with a simply shove. I put my nose to the floor, and there was definitely a strong current of stink-air coming from that spot. The plumber did his thing, and on the way out said ""Sewer gas fixes are usually a 3 visit minimum. Usually never a first time fix.""

That was yesterday.

There is definitely an improvement- but, there is still some odor coming from the tub drain. If I put my nose to it, I can sense a draft and the smell is not pleasant. Also, it still stinks in each cabinet under every sink.

I'm hoping the problem is in fact fixed, but the smell is taking some time to go away (in the pipes and in the cabinets). I should mention that the p-traps under each sink look fine. Obviously, I can't tell about the tub.

I felt sick all that day- hopefully it's just psychological.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

The ballast itself has an illuminated toggle switch when it is on which still works.. So I guess the ballast just failed somehow? Or perhaps the bulb burned out?

For the past month or so, we've experienced a very noticeable drop in temperature while using our shower. As I have no knowledge of whether our property owner changed the water heating system or any other plumbing, my best theory for fixing the low water temperature is to adjust the mixer in our shower valve. 

However, I popped the handle off, and this is what it looks like: http://imgur.com/a/qMd0I#0 (Sorry the pictures are upside-down!)

As you can see in the album, there is a cover plate which I suspect can be removed, but not by hand; it seems to be adhered to the shower wall, and would require some prying. 

From searching around the web, I know that there should be something like a gear system inside the valve, but I cannot figure out how to access it.

Can anyone give me advice on how to ""get in there"" and tinker around? 

I don't know for sure that adjusting this valve will solve our problem, but I suspect its a viable fix. I've heard it said elsewhere that sometimes the limiting notch slips a bit once in a while, causing the temperature max to drop.

Thanks!

**Edit** 

Both the kitchen sink and bathroom sink are able to produce (what feels like) substantially hotter water than the shower, which, though I haven't been able to measure the difference with a thermometer, lends evidence to my theory that the shower valve needs tweaking.

**Edit 2**

Tried it and the plate is almost certainly secured to the wall in some way, likely bathroom caulk: light prying with a flat-head produced no detectable movement. I placed a service-order with maintenance, if I'm around when they fix it, and I can find out what the problem was and what they did to fix it (if they fix it) I'll post about it here. Thanks everyone for your advice and such.

**Edit 3**

Just an update in case anyone is still interested. Turns out I was right about the mixer valve, well partway at least. The cartridge water mixer valve was busted in our shower and needed to be replaced. I found this out when our property manager sent over a maintenance personnel to check things out.

After looking some things up, I came to the conclusion that the 1 wire not hooked up to the old 2 prong outlet was a ground wire that would work with the new 3 prong outlet.  However, after installing the new outlet, a tester shows the outlet as 'open hot' instead of 'correct'.

A few questions:  How can I make it correct?  If this is not easily possible, is it safe to use the outlet as 'open hot?'  

Thanks for any help you can give.

Yesterday I noticed a second brownish stain, about 1 or 2 meters away from the first. This time however, I saw a ""bulge"" in the middle of stain, like a pimple on someone's face. When I got home from work this evening the bulge had ""punctured"" and water was dripping slowly. A couple of hours later, the second one followed.

My boss didn't want it, so I took it home and attempted to repair it. I managed to solder the  connector back on, but the connector had little plastic clip type things that slot into a hole on the motherboard and kinda lock the connector in place. One of the clips was actually broken, so the connector is very loose. I used hot glue to stick it down, but one year later, and after a few times of having to remove the power cable, the glue has come off, and the connector has become lose again. I'm worried it'll come off the board again if I remove the power cable again.
So I'm wondering if anyone knows any better solutions? Hot glue doesn't really work too well on motherboards I guess, is there any other glue that would be better? I guess it would be best if I could just replace the whole connector, but I'm not sure where I can get one like it. I did think of just replacing it with a totally different type of connector, but I'd like to keep it with the original if possible.

Office chair: The plastic collar that holds one of five wheels in place has broken!  In the image, notice the hub has inner walls to hold the wheel pin vertical, and outer walls to support the inner walls.  One side of an inner wall collapsed outward.  

Consequences: Wheel falls out during rolling maneuvers, resulting in catastrophic instability and reduced load-bearing capacity.  

Structural materials: Inner and outer walls of wheel hub: plastic.  Wheel pin: metal.

Measures taken: 
1) Attached a block of foam in place of the wheel to slide across the floor; friction across broad surface area quickly caused lateral failure.

2) Inserted a metal plug in place of the failed inner wall; quickly failed due to incorrect shape and insufficient reinforcement.

3) Built up a replacement inner wall with layers of epoxy [remnants visible in photo]; terrible idea, difficult to shape globule and of insufficient strength.

I have a set of G51 5.1 surround speakers hooked up to my PC that are well past their warranty and suddenly stopped working.

The speakers are set up like this: 4 audio leads are connected from the sound card on the back of my PC to the subwoofer (centre, rear, sub etc..). A control box (which sits on my desk) is also connected to the subwoofer via some sort of serial port. The control box has headphone and microphone inputs on it. Each of the 5 speakers connect via a single cable into the sub as well.

Now, when I have my headphones plugged in to the control box, the speakers are automatically muted (I do this at night so I don't disturb my neighbors). When I unplug the headphones everything reverts. There's even separate volume levels the control box stores for headphones and speakers.

Now, when I unplugged my headphones today my speakers put out no sound, not even a hum. The indicators on the control box indicate the headphones are unplugged, so there isn't anything stuck in the jack. The headphones in the meantime, still work fine when plugged in, which means to me that the output from the sound card is A-okay. All the levels on my PC read normal as well. Tapping on any of the leads yields nothing.

Now, obviously, 5 speakers don't fry at the same time usually (I've tried plugging them into something else and they are working), so I'm thinking it's a blown fuse, and I'm ready to tear apart the subwoofer to find it, but I'm posting here first for further consultation in case I missed something obvious.",,False,self,t5_2rf27,False,,,True,t3_16bssq,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/16bssq/logitech_g51_speaker_system_repair/,

me and my girlfriend moved in to a brand new apartment about 5 months ago (we're renting) in Toronto.

It's caused significant water damage to the wood panel bellow the windows.

There's definitely no leaks, the building guys came in and checked that. They told us to use the fan in the bathroom and above the stove, which we obviously do when we're using the bathroom or cooking. This makes no difference.

We borrowed a dehumidifier from family. We've run it for a while but can't run it while we're home (It's very loud). It seemed to grab a lot of water from the air but didn't make a significant difference to the condensation.

Does anyone know what's going on? Or what we can do to fix it? I figure there must be a crap load of humidity in our apartment, where's it coming from?

I've got these push-button indicators assemblies that came out of an old Air Force missile site. (The missile site in question had been flooded for 20+ years.) They're Roto-Tellite indicators, made by Master Specialties which (I believe) is now owned by Eaton. The indicators have a mostly plastic body, and they have this funky crystallization all over (due to the 20+ year swim in Lake Titan).

I'm trying to figure out the best way to clean these things up. I was thinking about ultrasonically cleaning them, but a decent ultrasonic cleaner is a few hundred bucks. I was able to do a preliminary cleaning on one using some warm water, and while it looks significantly cleaner, it's not completely there yet. Can anyone recommend a cleaning process/cleaner to get these things shined up again?
Things to keep in mind:

- The indicator body is mostly plastic

- There are electrical contacts inside

- The internals could use a cleaning as well.

My bathtub is draining really slowly so I think I've either got a hair clump or possibly a small toy stuck in the drain. The bathtub drains almost straight down through the basement to the main leading to the sewer.

My problem is that the square plug on the water pipe is super old and rusted and I'm having a hell of a time getting it loose.

Here are some pictures. The stuff dripping from the cap is Liquid Wrench. You'll notice from the pics that this thing is also in an awkward position. I'm using a wrench to get around the square cap and then using a hammer to nail the wrench, hoping to jar this thing free.

[Here's a link to the imgur album of pics.](http://imgur.com/a/toM5k)


Does anyone have any recommendations as to how to get this thing loose? So far I've been applying the Liquid Wrench pretty liberally every half hour or so, then wiping it down and reapplying. I've done that 3 times now over the last hour and a half or so.

I also took my hammer and hit the square part of the plug relatively lightly for a minute or so, hoping that the vibrations would help loosen things up.

I also have WD-40 but I figured the Liquid Wrench would be better. Any ideas? I'm a new first-time homeowner so I'm relatively limited on tools and know-how but I'll go get a tool if that's what it takes.

Thanks!

**UPDATE** - My brother and I were actually able to get it off the night before last with Liquid Wrench, a pipe wrench, and a relatively small mallet.

I think what helped is that I took the tip of a dart and ""carved"" a bunch of gunk out along the threading of the plug and then reapplied the liquid wrench. I did that twice.

After that my brother applied pressure while I used the mallet and it came loose.

I got a big hunk of something out of there (either a clump of 50 years worth of hair or maybe it was toilet paper or a paper towel with hair around it) and got the cap back on. Now it drains perfectly.

Thanks to all for your posts and suggestions!

I am hoping for some help in fixing my 2004 Chevy Impala.  It has numerous problems, two of which are the following...

1. An old problem that I have had to troubleshoot a number of times is the fact that the car simply refused to start.  The battery was not dead, the starter worked just fine, and I had no other electrical problems that I was aware of.  In 2008, I had to have my ignition switch replaced.  The mechanic did not know what happened, but the switch froze, and absolutely nothing would get the key to turn.  So we replaced the entire switch (a costly repair).  Now I have a problem with my passlock system - occasionally when I attempt to start my car, nothing will happen, and my ""Security"" light will flash.  A fix I found online (after many, many hours trying to discover the problem), was to re-calibrate the passlock system: simply put the key in the ignition, turn to ""ON"", wait for 10 minutes, then start the car.  Works every time.  As you can imagine, some days I do not have time to wait around for 10 minutes for the car to start.  **Is there any way for me to completely bypass the passlock system or to turn it off?**

2. More recently, my radiator fan continues to run after the engine is shut off.  A simple fix is for me to turn the engine back on and off again.  But I am concerned this is only fixing the symptoms, not the actual problem.  I just recently spent the week in Savannah and one of the valets completely killed my battery because of this problem.  **Could it be a bad sensor/relay, and how would I be able to tell?**

3rd seems to be hit and miss, shifting up to 4th usually causes it to stall out. 

Downshifting
From 4th or 3rd or 3rd to 2nd
A throttle blip on the downshift usually results in a very delayed response

So far we have tried - New gas, new plugs, removed the carbs and cleaned the jets and fuel bowls, ran it without the air filter, checked the fuel filter in the tank and the petcock valve. we haven't changed the fuel filter as the Honda dealer gave us the wrong one. 

I don't think it will come into play but it needs and oil change and there is a coolant leak. These are next on the list but from what I can read online there would be no link to above problem because of these issues?

Any idea what the problem could be?

Thanks in advance! : )

I blasted the heat on full blast (heater core can act as an auxiliary radiator) until we could stop at a parts store for help.

Here's the issue: neither of the fans will turn on at all. The coolant temperature level gauge on the dash goes up and up and up but still no action from the fans. We replaced the coolant temperature sensor located right next to the thermostat to no avail. The only way we made it from virginia back to ohio was by taking a relay apart, rigging it by jamming a bunch of metal in there to force it closed, and forcing the fans to stay on.

Here's what i know: the wiring from the fuse box (relay) to the fans is good. the fans work with the rigged relay in their respective sockets. The coolant temperature sensor is brand new, but the wiring on the pigtail has a wire that is slightly broken, although it can still carry some current. The coolant gauge on the dash is working so something is telling the computer how hot it is. Whatever is wrong, i know for a fact that it's preventing both of the cooling fan relays from kicking on (there are two fans).

My question is: Are there two coolant temperature sensors? Is there a fan switch i'm not aware of? Where is the wiring from the computer to the fuse box routed? Could that small tear in the wire leave too little voltage for the relays to kick over?

Lightning caused a serge that traveled through the coaxial cables (or possibly the power cord, although they were behind serge protectors there) of my grandfather's Verizion FIOS TV box and took out 2-3 phones, some speakers/intercom, and his 37"" Vizio TV. He said I could have the TV to try and get it to work. I opened it up and immediately checked the fuse. It works according to my meter. I cannot see any other physical damage, but I am no expert and do not possess a trained eye for this kind of stuff. Also, of course, I plugged it in and tried to turn it on for luck, but it was a no go.

I put it all together again for shiz and giggles, and to my surprise there is power running to the ""Vizio"" logo on the front of the TV. The power supply board appears to be receiving power (I got shocked when trying to run my voltage indicator along the power wires to the board, shame on me!)

I spoke with my grandfather once more, he said that the FIOS TV box was connected to the TV through the RCA ports (Red-White-Yellow) so the surge either traveled from there or the power cord, but because the power cord was on a power strip with surge protector and the fuse is fine on the TV's power supply, I am finding that unlikely).

So with this newly updated information, does this change anything? Am I shiz out of luck? Is there any way to test the individual components, or because I have not invested much time and no money, should I just call it quits right now?

I bought an off-brand TV from a sketchy company with a shitty return policy. Lesson learned? Most certainly.

I can hear my PS3 turning on; it's connected fine, the audio is fine, but there's no video except for the logo upon turning the unit on.

2 weeks ago, car wouldn't start.  Can't remember what lights came on, but not the check engine light (maybe the service light?  maybe all of them? I don't remember).  Lights worked.  Radio worked until I turned the key.  Engine made a weak wheezing noise.  Popped the hood, checked the fuse box (new-ish battery).  Pulled out the IGN fuse (ignition?) and the two battery fuses, they looked fine.  Pulled out the gray box marked ""CRANK"" (is that a relay?  I don't know..) and couldn't figure out what it was, so I put it back in.  Then the car started fine.

Fast forward a week.  Same thing.  Pop the gray box out and in, pop the fuses out and in, car starts.  This time I noticed that, before I popped the hood to do the ""trick"", the needles on all my gauges dipped down below their minimums whenever I would turn the key.

Fast forward to this morning.  No start, but now the ""trick"" isn't working.  The ""BRAKE"" light (for when my E-brake is on) and the ""SERVICE"" light (with a little wrench icon) are both on, but dim when I try to turn the key.  It is not doing the needles-below-minimum thing today, though.  Both lights are staying on without the key in the ignition.

So, two questions:

1) What is that gray box?  There are 5 different ones in the fuse box.  They have 4 pins.  (EDIT: I googled the numbers, they are relays.  No need to answer this one)

2) How fucked am I?  I can't really afford major repairs.  The battery is under warranty, but I can't walk it up to autozone to have it tested/replaced.  I'm already pretty sure I'm gonna be very late for work if I can make it at all today.

Edit: I have tried swapping the crank relay out for another identical relay that was in the fuse box.  No dice.

It works, but there seems to be a bad contact or something, because sometimes it will stop working properly. That is the volume will get very very low, almost inaudible unless I turn the volume at the maximum. 

I have a hard time identifying the source of the problem, because it will work on and off for seemingly no reason when moving the radio, or touching some buttons... 
I have also discovered that using the input switch (Tape/LW/MW/FM switch) will cause the problem to occur every time (or so it appears), and shorting a fuse to a piece in the radio will make it work again... 

I have made [a short video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vrB_O0MXC0) showing this. You can hear the radio working, but when I switch the band selector to something else than FM and then back again to FM, it no longer works until I make a contact between a fuse and what appears to be a power transformer (or is it? that's what I found googling the serial engraved on the thing anyway). So yeah, I know this is totally unsafe (happened first by accident). 

Note that the problem does not only affect FM playback, but other inputs as well. 

So, any idea what I should check? It's kind of a stretch, but maybe someone will be able to tell where the problem occurs given the symptoms... I have basic knowledge in electronics but the thing is ancient, and it's a clusterfuck of wires (no PCB!?) and huge condos and resistors. (It also reeks of cat piss.)

So I've been using since last summer a self powered radio from daewoo, it worked just fine till randomly 2 weeks ago the stick connected to the dynamo stopped moving properly.

I've opened 3 times already to see if I can manage to fix it, but I have no idea. The problem is, when I spinned it, it had a certain feeling as if it was opposing resistance, and while doing it, it generated energy. When I say stopped moving I mean it kind of lost that resistance, and now it moves way more freely, does not matter how many times I try to put it together again.

So if you happen to have a similar one or have a clue, I'd stop going insane while working 8 hours staring at the infinite.

* Ran the gas out of it  
* Removed old oil  
* Removed blade for sharpening  



At the start of this season:  

* Put gas in the mower  
* Filled with oil  
* Forgot to put on the blade  
* Started the mower  
* Ran &lt;30 seconds before I realized the blade was missing  
* Installed the blade  
* Mower refused to start  
* Replaced air filter, gas, and spark plug  
* With the help of a little starter fluid, it started  
* Ran 30+ minutes, smoothly and no smoke  
* Killed the engine  
* Refused to start again even with the starter fluid  
* Tested the plug on the case, no spark. The plug was not damp or dark, but the electrode above the gap had some light gray build up [picture](http://i.imgur.com/Rlaeopi.png)  
* Replaced the plug (a week later)  
* Three pulls of the cord later (no starter fluid), it fired right up  
* Ran again 30+ minutes, no smoke, but an occasional misfire  
* If I released the safety handle while it was running, but grabbed it before the momentum in the flywheel was gone it would fire back up  
* Killed the engine  
* Refuses to start

Could running it without the blade damage the engine? What could be fouling up the plugs? Any other advice or suggestions would be most appreciated.

I'll make this simple as can be. I need part #451 in this diagram :

It has a little plastic clip that holds the lower wash arm of the dishwasher in place.

As far as I can tell, this seems to be a common part in many dishwasher types. However, I seem have a rather unique model number for which I cannot find any parts nor support. The number is VSD2304P00SB (on manual it is written VSD2304PSB) and I believe it is unique due to the fact that it is a unique unit that is given to new condo builders.

I think the part I need is WD12X10244 (from GE website) but I do not know if it will be compatible with my unit, and nobody seems to have ever heard of my model number. It is on the GE site at http://www.gebuilder.ca/jsp/ge_Features.jsp?model_id=55519&amp;product_id=23&amp;cmb_Brands=---&amp;cmb_Colours=---&amp;cmb_496=---&amp;cmb_565=---&amp;cmb_PriceMax=---&amp;cmb_PriceMin=---&amp;count=1 but I have very little information besides this link that goes to nowhere...

If it has to be re-wired, what kind of expense might that be? Are we talking about busting out drywall, or do wires just go in the crawl space under a house? It's on the exact opposite side of the house as the breaker and that's about 45 feet.

Over the last year, my electricity consumption (kWh, not talking about $ here) has more than doubled and I have no idea why or how to trouble shoot the situation.  There was a substantial jump a year ago and since then it's been continuing to increase.  We didn't purchase any new major appliances, no change in the number of people in the house or our work schedules.  Nothing in our routine seems like it could be the cause.  The house was built new in '07, gas forced air heat, gas water heater, gas stove, electric dryer and oven.

So far the electric company has been zero help.  If the meter is working correctly, they're not interested.  They claim the meter is probably working correctly because when the meter fails, it rarely reads fast (more electricity) but the other way around.  They said they could still send someone to test my meter but it would take several months before someone would get around to it because it's their lowest priority.

So, any thoughts on what I can do for myself to try to figure out where all the power is going?

**Edit:** Ok, cool.  All the advice makes total sense.  Sounds like I've got some work to do!  Thanks very much folks.

**Edit. Problem Solved!:** So the issue has finally been figured out.  I live in a duplex/townhouse (information I now realize is very important that I left out of my initial question), and it turns out when they were built 5 years ago the electric company put the wrong meter serial numbers on the wrong accounts.  So I'd been getting billed for my neighbor's electric meter the entire 5 years I've lived there.  My usage went up last year because a new family moved in with 2 little kids and are obviously doing more laundry, running the dishwasher more, etc. compared to the previous neighbors.

How would this system work?  There are only two wires, so if it is really line voltage then is the whole thermostat just a stand-in for a switch on the hot line?  And so I shouldn't pay attention to the colour of the wiring because they just reused a piece of standard house wiring?

If this is true then to test the voltage I would have to ground the multimeter on the common line of an outlet?  I only know enough about AC to be very careful, I haven't done any house wiring before.

I'll take the shroud off the heater tomorrow to have a look at how the wiring connects inside the unit, maybe it is labelled more clearly there.

The goal is just to ensure that there isn't a problem with the thermostat sending an on signal to the unit, I think the issue is in the radiator system, possibly an air bubble as we had a leaky radiator replaced about a month ago.",,False,self,t5_2rf27,False,,,True,t3_1avor0,http://www.reddit.com/r/fixit/comments/1avor0/heating_isnt_working_trying_to_understand_the/,

First we have ceiling spotlights in the kitchen that sometimes doesn't want to stay turned on, just flickers some but never light up. They are set on a dimmer. This set-up was already installed when we bought the apartment. There was just some flickering at first, but it just got worse from there on until we now can't even turn on the lights. 

Then we have a ceiling lamp in the living-room that keeps burning out the bulbs, we have to buy new ones at least once every other week. It doesn't matter what quality the bulbs are, they still burns out after about 1 ½ week. It's also on a dimmer but it won't dim anymore, just turn on and off. 

Lastly we often get strange power fluctuation, everything flickers for just a breath and then every things seems fine. But since we moved in we have had to replace a fuse around 15 times. I think that seems a bit too much for three years. Many times we wake up or come home with fuses blown. Meaning it wasn't caused by anything we did. 

My questions is, is the strange power fluctuations and blown fuses be cause by the broken lamp and spotlights or is it something more serious?
