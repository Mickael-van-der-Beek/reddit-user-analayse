_____

So in the sidebar, it goes into detail about /r/advancedrunning and what is supposed to be posted here. I really want to stress the importance of the ""advanced"" part of this subreddit.

Okay. I unsubscribed from /r/running for a reason. I take my running relatively seriously, and really enjoy the competitive aspect of it. Which is exactly why I unsubscribed from that subreddit. I felt like the majority of posts were about people's new 3:45 marathon, 19:00 5K, or 40:00 10K PRs. And frankly, I really don't give a shit. I mean, good for you and all, but to be honest, those times are not that impressive. And for the life of me, I could not understand why people felt the need to clutter up the feed with their feeble accomplishments.

Which brings me to /r/AdvancedRunning. The sidebar specifically states:  *post here for discussion of professional running, advanced training regimens, videos of races, nutrients and supplements, research and development of running related products and anything else for the competitive runner.*

I think that we need to have some definition of ""competitive running"" that's more than just running. Most of the training questions (specifically in the act of running) that get asked here are more suitable in /r/running, because most of the runners there are in the same boat as the person asking and can share running plans and things.

This subreddit is *advanced*. I'm interested in things like how doing a 400 instead of a 200 at the end of a workout would impact the quality of the workout. How, as a Boston qualifier, would I be able to achieve the 2:30 mark of a marathon. Leaked training plans of pros. Theories of advanced running mechanics and workout plans. Videos of tactical races and how we can learn from them. MORE general discussion of theories.

/r/AdvancedRunning is lacking in what it could be. The clutter-posts are removing the important ones by pushing them further down the feed. The activity could be a lot better, as well, but not just for shits and giggles. 

In my opinion, these are great examples of what should be posted in here:

1. [Twitch Fibers](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/19iv5r/questions_about_muscle_twitch_fibers/)

1. [Amount of lifting](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/18b7ir/how_much_lifting_is_too_much_lifting/)

1. [Analyzing professional runners](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/wmzys/bbc_documentary_history_of_olympic_1500_metres/)

1. [Record articles/videos/results](http://www.flotrack.org/article/18885-Lopez-Lomong-breaks-Lagats-5000-Meter-Indoor-American-Record)

We need more things like that.

So crucify me, ostracize me, whatever. This subreddit has so much potential, but is being held back by the misinformed who are too lazy to read the sidebar.

While it's great to see people interested in the sport, I want to make a suggestion to anyone looking for a new training plan, **before** you post in /r/AdvancedRunning asking for help.  

My suggestion is to go out and do research on your own, specifically through reading training books (you can obviously do research on the internet, but getting a few books from well renowned coaches is better IMO).  My recommendation is to go and get the [Daniel's Running Formula **2nd Edition**](http://www.amazon.com/Daniels-Running-Formula-2nd-Edition/dp/0736054928) (since there is a section specifically for high school cross country).

There should hopefully come a point in your running career, hopefully sometime towards the end of high school, when you understand the purpose behind every single run that you do.  You're never going to be able to get there just by listening to your Coach, so do some research.

It's great to see people who are new to this sport asking questions, but I don't think it belongs in /r/AdvancedRunning.  That's my opinion, let me know what you guys think.

TLDR; Go out and get the [Daniel's Running Formula **2nd Edition**](http://www.amazon.com/Daniels-Running-Formula-2nd-Edition/dp/0736054928) before asking how to break 19 minutes on this subreddit.

I started becoming interested in Chuckanut last year right after the race was run. Sage and Max got lost after making a huge, huge move on the middle 18. Adam Campbell won, and it kinda sunk in that this was THE race on the west coast where your mountain runners, and your road runners met to decide who really was faster. I didn’t completely decide that I was going to all out focus on Chuckanut until August ‘12 after I’d had a wide array of trail running success earlier that year.


My whole summer was back to back weeks of 70-90 miles with one solid long run on the Wonderland Trail starting out around 3 hours, and by the end of the summer extending to 6+ hours. I was training for the Cle Elum 25k (cancelled due to forest fires) and figured getting in as much vertical was essential. My daily runs started out around 10 miles with 1k of climbing. Mostly just on rolling trails around the suburbs I live in. I didn’t dedicate myself to trail only, mainly because I’m too lazy to drive to a trailhead every morning, and I didn’t want to fork over the gas money that often. Along with a long run, I did have the good fortune of every other week or so doing a solid hard effort run with a local running superstar. Aside from that my speedwork was essentially nil.


After the summer came to a close and the weather turned in the high country I ran a small XC season with my running club. It went pretty poorly, mainly due to a lack of specificity for shorter racing. Honestly by the end of XC I was done. I have never been as relieved to end a season as I was in November. A feeling that lasted all of 2 weeks, at which point I got back on the pony and moved back up to 80ish miles a week for 2 straight months. My long runs moved from the long gradual climbs on Rainier to the sharp steep brutal accents of local Squak and Tiger mountain. My daily run also moved from 10 miles to 14 miles with closer to 2k of climbing. By no means a super mountainous run, but clearly nowhere near flat. The two races I had on my mind were Orcas Island 50k in early February, and Chuckanut in March, so I tried to focus my daily running accordingly. My weekly mileage came out to well under 100 per week despite a “daily 14” soem days I’d feel whooped so I’d take a day super easy (5, maybe 6 miles). Other times I just couldn’t get a run in due to work.


Going in to Orcas I wanted to get up to 100 and never managed to get there. Despite which I completely surprised myself and everyone else running 4:21. At 8400 ft of climbing, that sort of time is no joke. I knew that between Early February and March all I needed to do was not mess myself up. Instead of bulking on the mileage and stretching up to triple digits, I stayed in the 80s 90s wheelhouse and tried to make those brutal 3-4 hour runs on Squak as easy as possible.
Last minute I decided to run the Mountain Marathon in Olympia, probably the one mistake in planning for Chuckanut. It was 2 full weeks out, but a miserably brutal course. I had done the half last year and opted to run the full because it was a more relaxed environment, and less tactically hectic. The Hillbilly Half felt like a long XC race when I ran it in 2012, and I was torched for weeks after, I envisioned the full marathon being an opportunity for a solid 3-4 hour effort with a bib on. The race turned out to be a barn burner, with between 5-6k of climbing and being chased by a sub 2:30 marathoner I absolutely scorched the course running a 45 minute CR in 3:14. I have a hard time holding back in races.


Between Mountain Marathon and Chuckanut I did very little. I ran MAYBE 80 miles in 2 weeks, and took several days completely off due to a stomach sickness that had me not eating for 2 days. Ughhhhh. By March 16th I had barely returned to feeling normal. 


On race day I honestly didn’t feel tip top, I slept poorly beforehand, and didn’t bring my typical breakfast of nutella and tortillas so I bummed some chunky peanut butter off the friend whose house I was staying at. Chunky peanut butter, always a mistake. Always.
I think I jogged for a grand total of 60 seconds before the start of the race, and went out like I normally do. Quickly. At Orcas, no one knew who I was, so I jumped out to an early lead and was never seen again. I used a similar tactic at Mountain Marathon and it worked wonders. Third time is a charm right? Main problem with this tactic is using it where people can see a full half mile down the trail at the beginning. By mile 3 Max King, David Laney, and Robert Krar had reeled me in and all four of us proceeded to run just under 6 minute miles all the way until the climbing began right before mile 7. At mile 6 King and Laney dropped me and Krar, Krar got a small lead on me leading into the trail and all three of them disappeared. Heading up the first major climb of the course I felt like absolute dog shit. I knew immediately I’d made a huge mistake going out to hard, and my legs were feeling terrible from NOT running substantially for two weeks prior. I don’t know if I felt the attempted recovery after Mountain Marathon, or the hard effort there. Either way i felt something missing. By mile 10 Laney and King had a solid 3 minute lead on me, I passed Krar right after mile 10, he dropped due to a calf issue, I was now in the top three. Moving up Cleator Rd to the ridge was probably the first time I started feeling good during the race. Something about putting it in low and grinding uphill made me feel like I was finding a groove. This groove continued all the way until the small downhill before the infamous Chinscraper Climb. At which point the shit hit the fan bigtime. I’ve never cramped at mile 20 in a race until yesterday. Normally I’m not a salt guy, I dont take it in training, I don’t take it in racing, I’m not sold on its benefits. I ate a hearty handful of endurolytes prior to Chinscraper and I honestly didn’t feel a damn difference, but maybe it did something.


Coming off of the top of the mountain was what felt like my weakest point. I was having a brutally hard time simply opening my stride up because my hamstrings were cramping so badly with every undulation. I could hear cheering several minutes behind me and I knew that I would need some form of miracle on the final 6+ miles of flat back to the start line to hold onto third place. I hadn’t seen anyone after mile 7 aside from Krar and had been running the last 2 hours completely terrified of being caught.


Hitting the final aid station with a touch under 7 miles left to run I got a swift mental kick to the head. I hit the aid station at 3:05 meaning if I ran 40 minutes like I’d planned to before hand I’d finish in 3:45. I left the aid station with no water, no gels, hand bottle tucked into my shorts, no hamstrings left, no chance of catching Laney (I assumed erroneously that Laney had been dropped by King at this point), and assuming there was a group of hungry guys waiting to eat up the last podium position.


The first miles I ran felt like 7s, check the Garmin... 6:30s. Huh, odd. The next few miles hurt way more and my body felt like everything was shutting down, check the Garmin... 6:11. What the fuck? It felt like with each mile my form got worse and somehow the times just kept dropping. How I held that together for the 42 minutes it took me to get back to the finish I will have no idea. It is without question the most amount of pain I’ve ever tolerated in a race.


I was pretty stunned to get 3rd. I think I managed one fist pump and whoop at the finish before I collapsed.



Take aways for me are as follows:

Consistency matters. It matters most, and it will always trump any other piece of the training puzzle. The consistency of running during the summer paid off months later despite a large break in uber long training, over an entire XC season. I also made the right move not packing the miles on when it didn’t feel right because I made it to the start line with no injuries. I didn’t suffer any injuries training for Orcas, and none training after that for Chuckanut. THAT is the most important thing to note. I have the slowest “speed” credentials to me of any runner in the top 10 of that race (including the women’s winner), and yet still managed 3rd place and I split the final 10 miles of the race faster than anyone else in the field.

http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1cgr7m/our_subreddits_official_boston_marathon_relief/


Today is arguably one of the saddest days in running history and a sad day in general for all of mankind. Runners, friends, family members, supporters, and innocent passersby were the victims of a callous attack with no respect for human life at the crown jewel of our beautiful and peaceful sport. 

Therefore I propose we start a fundraiser. I'm very new to this but feel that its the least we can do. I know people always ask for others money for these terrible events but this is personal. This hits home and hits at our core, it struck at what we are all passionate for. It is our duty as lovers of running to be bright lights in this very dark moment. 

I'm very new to this, I've never done a fundraiser. But I went for my run and tried to flesh a few details out and did a little research upon returning home. I suggest we use reddit.crowdtilt.com. Crowdtilt allows you to set a goal and no one is charged until that goal is reached at which time all credit cards are charged. Seeing as how there is no funds set up immediately, I cannot put a name for which organization we will be donating to, but I'm sure within a few days a victim fund will be setup and I can edit the campaign for that to be where the donations go. 

Are we all on board for this? If we can agree and I get some verbals, I'll start it up. I also need to know what will be our ""tilt"" value. $1,000? $5,000? $10,000?

I will pledge $262 right off the bat. $10 for each mile of the marathon. 

Let's make a difference and show others that running is beautiful, compassionate, and peaceful. Let's rise above this darkness. ",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,1366128950.0,,,True,t3_1cf1xw,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1cf1xw/i_would_like_us_all_to_band_together_to_be_a/,

Namely...

&gt;Pass them on the back stretch (after 500m) and don't look back.

- /u/arbitrage10

&gt;Whatever you do, it's vital that you remain close to the lead group if you want a chance of winning.

- /u/phimax100

&gt;Your heels should never touch the ground.

- /u/floaticola

I combined these tips with experience gained throughout the season into the following strategy:

Start fast. Draft off the fastest guy (or guys, depending on the race) until the 200m, then chill for the next 100m while staying within 5m of the front pack. Move after the 300m mark - catch as many guys as you can before turn number three. Most of the time, I'll be ahead of all but the front one or two guys at this point, and they're starting to wear out on the third turn. Draft off them and charge your kick. The second you reach the third straight, move into lane two and accelerate. Not full sprint; it's still too early for a kick. But get ahead of the group. Chances are they think you're kicking way too early and let you go. By 600m, you need to be almost at sprinting speed. The guys behind you are starting their kick. With 150m left, you put it all on the table and hold on for dear life. The biggest thing you could do here is keep up your form: lift your knees, run light, arms pumping *in line with the track*, shoulders square. Give it everything all the way through the finish.

Using this strategy, I've gone from a 2:05.35 to a 2:00.45 so far this season (went from a 2:02.91 to a 2:00.45 in four days) and I'm ranked second in my district right now. Now, with regionals, state, and (hopefully) our Meet of Champions left, I'm curious about any pointers you might have before I go into the ""playoffs.""

The Atlantic City marathon doesn't draw the crowds like Chicago, New York or Boston. None the less, 26.2 mile in any race is daunting. I looked up at the banner that was swaying in the wind. It was going to be a rough day fighting wind. Derek and I lined up just behind the Ethiopian contingent that made the trip for the race. With the sound of the horn - we were off. 

Miles 1 - 7
Derek rarely wears a Garmin so when I saw it on his wrist that morning, I knew he was hell bent on pacing himself correctly. I kept Derek about 15 seconds ahead of me as the course wound off the boardwalk and towards Brigantine Island. Through the first tunnel and up a slight incline, the mile markers were ticking off as I held a steady 6:33 pace. I crossed the mat at the 5k mark in 20:32 and picked up the pace a bit to get back on track. Rounding the bend at mile 4, a small shadow lurked behind me. Out of the corner of my eye, a bicyclist appeared in a bright yellow shirt and began talking to my shadow. He said ""Hi. I'm Steve. I'll be with you the rest of the race."" Turning my neck a bit more, a small Ethiopian woman was hot on my heels but she did not pass. Her name was Gedese Edeto and was the lead female for the race. I was running her pace. I was also a hell of a shield for her due to the strong winds. I actually didn't mind her following because I had her and Steve to converse with. If we missed a water stop, Steve would circle back on his trusty bicycle and retrieve us water. At mile 6, something strange happened. Both of my feet suddenly had a pins and needles sensation in them. I wanted to pull off to the side and loosen my laces but then I'd lose Steve and Gedese. Derek was too far ahead and there was only a few half marathoners with us. I decided to see how things went and kept plunging ahead with my shadow. 

Miles 8 - Halfway
Gedese didn't say much. When she did speak, it was in broken English and I had a hard time understanding. We took a sharp right back onto the boardwalk and towards the area where we started. Steve was directly in front of us waving the early (or late for that matter) tourists from the casinos out of our way. It was nice running on the boardwalk. There's a slight spring in your step from the boards giving way that almost felt soothing. The wind picked up and I was struggling to keep pace. At times, I put my head down as if to battle it. When we reached mile 9, Gedese asked me how many kilometers were left. I know that a marathon is slightly over 42 kilometers but while running that hard, my math is never good. I turned and told her ""A lot."" At the halfway mark, we were left completely alone. With this silence, I realized that my feet were no longer numb which a very good thing was at that moment. I could see Derek up ahead but behind me was no man's land. I was glad to be half over but knew I had a whole lot of work to do. As we turned off the boardwalk and onto Atlantic Ave, we picked up another guest. 

Halfway - Mile 21
Our new guest blasted his siren as we passed into streets lined with orange cones. We now had a police escort. Steve was still with us and rode with the police officer side by side. I don't know what they were talking about but they had some pretty good laughs up there. Around mile 14, I took a wrong turn into a dead end street and Gedese followed but we were quickly corrected by Steve. At mile 15, I see Derek turning the hairpin corner and gave him a shout out. Miles 18 - 20 are winding through the streets of Ventnor but it allows you to finally see the leaders of the marathon. The leader (and eventual winner), Ethiopian Berhanu Mekonen was a teammate of Gedese and as we passed, they yelled encouragement in their native tongue. Several other male Ethiopians passed then a few guys I saw at the start. I saw Derek but couldn't say anything to him because we were about to make another turn. At mile 20, I started to feel the effects of running into the wind. My legs were hurting but as I counted each male that passed us the other direction, I realized I could possibly make top 10. Was the roulette wheel right? 

Mile 21 - 26.2
I wasn't the only one in pain. Gedese fell off the pace and fell back a bit. I'd had to check and double check my pace because I was afraid I was going too fast. I passed 2 other men at mile 21 but the wind was picking up again. At mile 22, Steve and the police officer were well behind me but I wasn't alone. I was back on the boardwalk and had made to the turn around point for the half marathon. It was 2 hours into the race but the recreational runners and walkers were just making the turn. Then tragedy struck. It first started as a tiny cramp in my left quadriceps. Then it moved to the left calf. Then, my right calf. With the wind so strong, the sweat on my had been evaporating at such a rate that it was hard to gauge my perspiration rate during the race. I was severely dehydrated and I needed to take action. Now. At mile 23, I pulled into the water station and came to a dead standstill. I grabbed 3 cups of water and downed them right then and there. I took another cup of Gatorade and walked for about 10 seconds. I started running again and felt a little better. At mile 24, there were a group of older ladies sitting out on their ocean view deck. Each had a cup of coffee in their hands and waved at me. I looked up and jokingly said ""Don't ever do this."" They each let out a large burst of laughter. A few seconds later, I could hear them cheering and the sound of a motorcycle. Gedese had caught me. She passed me at mile 25 and I tried to latch on. My legs could just not go any faster. She said something in her native tongue that seemed encouraging and that sparked me to just keep chugging along. Just before mile 26, a man on a bicycle (not Steve) rode up next to me and offered encouraging words. I never caught his name. Instead, I asked him to stay with me. I asked him about what he had for dinner last night, what he planned on doing the rest of the day just to keep my mind off the fact that I had a mile to go. He also informed me that I was in 7th place overall which brought tears to my eyes. He offered me water from his own pack - to which I responded ""No thanks - I'm already fucked."" He told me I was amazing, strong and fast. I responded with ""when I finish, I'm going to need a medic right away"". This stranger stayed with me until mile 26. Whoever you were - I thank you. I can tell you that in running, seeing the finish line is one of the best feelings in the world. Everything that hurts goes away and your accomplishment sets in. At times, this is overwhelming. I finished the race in 2 hours and 56 minutes. Not my best time but without question (as my coach put it) my best effort in a marathon to date. 

AFTER THE FINISH
 I crossed the finish line and fell to onto the boardwalk on all fours. I was severely dehydrated and exhausted -  but I was elated. After a few seconds - I heard a voice in my head that shouted ""Get your shit together"" and stood up. I was dizzy and confused. Had I just finished a marathon? Where was Derek? Was that Derek's wife cheering for me? What's Quinny doing? Do I need gas for the ride home? I walked to the end of the chute, collected my medal and waiting was Gedese. She looked and me and started crying. She limped over to me, hugged me tight and in broken English said ""Thank you"". I hugged her back. I had literally paced her to victory.  
 

 I made my way to the refreshment table and nothing looked appetizing. Not the bananas, not the water, not the pretzels - not anything. It was then I realized I may be in trouble. A woman about the same age as me was standing in the courtyard finish area. She looked me in the eye and I said ""I need an medic."" Instantly, her and several of her friends escorted me with rubber gloves (we are sweaty and stinky sons of bitches after all) to the medical tent. I sat down in a chair and was given several ice packs (I stashed one in the groin area and one behind my neck). A black bag and young brunette were then rushed to my side. The young girl pulled out her stethoscope and unzipped her bag. She asked me ""What's wrong?"" I replied ""I'm very dehydrated. Can you bag me? (IV bag of saline)"" She said back to me ""In the state of New Jersey, only a medic can administer an IV bag."" Hold the phone. I asked her ""Then what exactly are you?"" She replied ""An emergency responder. You'll have to go to the Emergency Room for an IV bag."" I declined that ludicrous offer and simply asked for salt pills and more water. I had to sign a release form when I left due to the marathon liabilities. I’m still not sure why a ""New Jersey medic"" was not assigned to the ""MEDIC"" tent. 
 
 AWARDS
Without getting into too much detail - I walked it off. I took salt pills, drank copious amounts of water and didn't get up until I felt okay. After walking for a few minutes and picking up my bag, I felt like me again. I met up with Derek and we sat in the sun on the board walk and waited for our awards. I took third in my age group (bested by an Ethiopian and Derek). 
 
 I believe in luck. But I also believe that luck is the result of hard work. You can mix numbers to tell any tale you want. But that day, the roulette wheel wasn't wrong. We did go top 15. As a matter of fact, if you add 1 + 5 you get six. This was my male placing for that day. I'm a sucker for table games - but I'm more of sucker for the satisfaction that I hung it out there on race day, persevered and accomplished my goals - regardless of time.

In the example of rehabilitation, most of us can't even fathom the standard ""take time off"" and it would just not work.

When I first started this sub reddit I would have never imagined it blowing up like this. Yesterday was a big day for us. Take a look at some of these numbers. 

http://i.imgur.com/xcaaC.jpg

Having said that, I want to talk about something much more serious. While we grew rapidly yesterday and had some great publicity, we also received accusations of being a circlejerk and being pretentious (a lot of that was my way for so strongly defending the P.I. ads and doing it with fervor as I call it or vitriol as others saw it.) We have to be honest, a sub reddit which caters to a topic, but specifically to a much smaller group of people within a topic who have more experience with said topic will naturally become a circlejerk and become stagnant in thought and eventually so repulsively pretentious it turns its own people away from it (see r/atheism). I thought that so far we've all done an incredible job, the links have been incredible for months, the race descriptions, the links to great videos, the enthusiasm, the help you've shown for other runners both fast and slow. It's been great. 

Therefore I'd like to apologize if I fueled the ""pretentious/circlejerk"" debate. I'm the first to introduce people to running and I'll defend the sport to the death which also means, I have strong opinions on issues. I'm sorry if that made me sound pretentious over the internet! I think the best way I can clearly say that I'm not is a comment I posted in the ""how fast do you have to be to be called advanced"" last week.

Having said that, some other thoughts. 

I will be adding the downvote button to COMMENTS only. I do this with hesitation, I've always disliked the fact that people downvote out of disagreement and not out of the fact that a person is just wrong. Please use the downvote button like an adult. You really don't need to punish idiocy with downvotes as much as you can show your own knowledge with upvotes you'll receive with a well crafted response. Let upvotes do the talking is all I ask. 

Next, at 1000 ""racers"" I will be adding IndianXC as a mod. I don't care if he approves or not, that's what will be happening. :p

If you want flair, PM aconcernedconsumer or myself and we'll take care of it. 

Lastly, just because I'm a Mod doesn't mean I can't say things that are aggressive or say things that express how I truly feel with emotion. My ""mod"" status doesn't make me not human and above opinions. But just because I do that doesn't make me a bad mod, i've never censored comments, content, or banned a user. Remember, i'm just a human people. I make mistakes too. PM me if you ever want to address a specific comment I make that you feel is out of line, I'm very reasonable, I can assure you of that. 

As a final note, you guys are awesome. I love this subreddit. I'm only subscribed to a few subs and this is easily my favorite. Keep up the amazing work. 

Tl;dr, Lot of new users. Try to keep the circlejerk to a minimum but it will sometimes happen. I'm a mod but i'm a human, I make mistakes, PM me if you feel I get out of hand. Flair if you want it, just PM me. IndianXC to be a mod at 1000 subscribers. Downvotes now allowed for comments. 

May the winds blow at your back.

1350841130.0,28,self.AdvancedRunning,11unnz,My redemption for the disastrous AF Marathon: Columbus Marathon race report. ,justarunner,32,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/11unnz/my_redemption_for_the_disastrous_af_marathon/,"Five weeks ago was my disastrous AF marathon where I went out in 2:37 pace. At mile 18 I started faltering hard and had to get an IV by  mile 22. I ended up jogging it in much later for a whopping 4:13. 

A week later I registered for the Columbus Marathon. I used the 6 week schedule by Pfitzinger but just jumped in on the 2nd week after a week off.

I didn't ever think about the Columbus Marathon. I registered and then just kind of forgot about it. Instead focusing on each day and each run and just trying to enjoy myself. Failing so hard at AF after putting so much pressure on myself was a huge emotional let down. So I was just trying to enjoy the running. 

Yesterday I went to the expo, it was pretty damn awesome. Wore my shirt that says ""running sucks"", generated a few laughs. Good time to wear that shirt. 

Last night my Garmin shit its pants on me. The screen just said ""Garmin"" and wouldn't do anything. No buttons work. It wouldn't reset and I was pretty mad. So I eventually mellowed out and took it as a sign that I didn't need a watch. 

Woke up this morning, took a quick shower and drove over to columbus. I decided not to warm up and to instead just put on my flats and jump in about 10 rows back. I wore my ""I Love Fast Women"" shirt for the race which garnered tons of laughs throughout the race. Gun went off and I jumped out to a 6:25 mile and felt really comfortable. From there I ran the next five miles with this woman and we just chatted. Ran 7-9 with a dude doing the half before he accelerated. Then ran 10-12 with a girl doing the half. She dumped me at the start of the 13th mile because she only had a mile life. So then I ran alone for miles 13, 14, and 15. 

Up to this point I had been faring pretty well. My 10km split was 39 minutes, so about 6:17 pace. My half marathon split was 1:21:36, so I ran 6:12 pace for that portion of the race. 

So I had caught these two guys and we ran together until mile 19. Mile 18 was cool because we got to run through the Ohio State field. I'm a huge college football fan, so this made me very happy. At mile 19 we caught the first place woman and I decided it was time to race. So I hit the 20 mile mark with a split of 2:04:59 which was about 6:18 pace for the previous 7 miles. 

This is where shit got fun. I started moving, Miles 21, 22, and 23 I went 18:05. One of those miles was a 5:59 too. (I was just counting off the clocks since I didn't have a watch.) By mile 24, the pain was arriving. I fell back to 6:15 pace and was starting to hurt. The good news was though that I was picking off runners left and right. 

Mile 25 was horrible, the pain was so intense. I ran a 6:25 and was just ecstatic to know I was on the 26th mile. That last 1.2 was so damn long. I don't know what I ran for the last mile but I'm pretty sure it was about 6:20 or so. Then I just had a big sprint for the final .2 miles and finished in 2:43:28. I told myself before the race that my goal pace was 6:15 and I needed to start at 6:20 pace. So to nail both of those was just great.  

I'm pretty happy. I ran with no watch and my pacing was perfect. I was never passed by another marathoner after mile six I believe? So I ran 20 miles of just passing people which was fantastic for my confidence. I smashed my old PR of 2:55:12. I took 2nd out of 270+ runners in my age group (some people are still finishing). And my football team won last night. It was a good weekend. 

The plan for now is to take 7-10 days off and just forget about running. Jog for a few weeks. And then start a training cycle for most likely the Publix Georgia Marathon. 

Tl;dr, Garmin broke before race. Ran without a watch which was probably in my best interest. Ran really awesome splits and ran a 2:43:28. Beat my old PR by about 12 minutes and took 2nd in my age group. Will most likely be doing the Publix Georgia Marathon in March. 

Thanks for reading people! Good luck with your training and your races.

I'm interested in running obviously and more specifically, event management, so this was pretty much a no brainer. Dave is a 3rd tier contact for me, so it wasn't too hard to get his contact info. Just had to reach through two other people. Dave was really nice, and incredibly quick to get back with me, and as the icing on the cake, let me add him on LinkedIn! Have to make those connections!

If you have any questions, let me know, otherwise, here's what Dave has to say about a few various questions I proposed. 

He also knows I'm putting this up on the forum, I asked and he okayed it! 

*How did you get involved with the B.A.A. and what has been the path that has taken you to race director?*

**Started in 1988.  In 1987, there were issues at the start of the race and so the BAA felt a need to hire someone to help address those and so, voila!!  They hired me as the Technical Coordinator, then I was called the Technical Director and then the Race Director in 2001…all along my job responsibilities remained about the same….just making sure there are no mess ups!**    

*How many Boston Marathons have you run?*

**I have run 40 in a row…15 during the day and then 25 at night after my duties as race director are over.**

*What’s your best memory as race director?* 

**Probably helping to direct the 100th Boston with almost 40,000 in the race.**

*If you could change things and go back and redo your path to where you currently are, what would you change?*

**Business wise (I own my own event management business – DMSE, Inc.) maybe “own” more events then just managing them.  Seems like there is a huge market out there now for events!**

*What advice would you give to someone interested in working in the running industry, be it a sales rep, a race director, or anything in between?*

**Nothing better than to work at something you love and are passionate about but it is very, very labor intensive…you get “married” to it and the toughest part is slowing down and/or saying no sometimes.**

*The Boston Marathon is arguably the most famous marathon in the world, what have you done as the race director to preserve that image and prevent the Boston Marathon from losing that luster?*

**My job is to maintain the quality of the race itself and make sure that it all goes well for ALL the participants in the race.  I hope I have succeeded at that over the past 25 years.**

*This year you made it harder to qualify for Boston by making the qualifying times lower, what was the impetus behind that decision and what has been the general reaction to that decision?*

**The worst thing was turning qualifiers away. Didn’t make sense…people work hard, qualify, think they are in but in the end they are not. We had to respond to the marketplace and did.  It is working like a charm now.**

*The Boston Marathon is already a massive race, one that is planned out years in advance, how do you plan to continue to grow the name of the Boston Marathon or grow the actual race?*

**To grow participation wise, you need more real estate.  We just don’t have it.  We are not going to jeopardize the quality of the race for quantity. We could just be maxed out where we are right now…maybe room for slight growth but not much.**

*Do you foresee any big changes in the “marathon world” that you perhaps would be more privy to knowing compared to runners who don’t work in the industry?* 

**Nothing earth shattering but you never know.  Technology seems to be driving a lot of what we do now so nothing will surprise me.**

*What has been the greatest challenge for you as the race director of one of the most notable marathons in the world?* 

**Probably making needed changes (like changing the start time or instituting wave starts) while also maintaining the history and tradition of this 116 year old race.**

*What do you see as the greatest threat to the continued growth of the Boston Marathon over the next 5 years? 10 years?* 

**As stated above, SPACE, or lack of.**  

*How is the Boston Athletic Association and therefore the Boston Marathon adapting to the ever changing world of sports with particular emphasis to social media? E.g., Twitter, Youtube, LinkedIn, Facebook, Blogs, etc.* 

**Not my area of the race but I do believe the BAA is keeping pace with social media as much as possible and reasonable. I find all of this overwhelming myself!!!**

*How is the Boston Athletic Association and therefore the Boston Marathon encouraging the growth of distance running among young American athletes considering that distance running is often an overlooked sport and one that does not necessarily “captivate” the hearts of the masses?*

**The BAA does a lot with local schools and youth running.  We have numerous youth programs in place already and will continue to develop those programs over the years.  This is a very important initiative of the BAA.**

*What do you see as the general direction/trend of distance running and what do you think is the driving cause of that direction/trend?* 

**Continued growth in participation. The walls of intimidation have crumbled.  People get it now.  It’s not as much about competition as it is about participation.  It’s about building self-esteem and self-confidence.   I think we are still seeing just the tip of the iceberg.** 

*I plan on doing my internship over my last two semesters with the U.S. Air Force Marathon. If you could offer any suggestions that a new intern could bring to a fast growing and successful marathon such as the AF Marathon to make a very positive impact, what would that be?* 

**Maybe try to be involved in EVERY aspect of the event to gain an appreciation for what everyone does.  As a Race Director, I actually consider myself a “conductor” like in an orchestra.   Thus, my main job is to surround myself with the very best in all the different areas of the event.  I just keep them all going, all motivated, all inspired so as to insure that the end product is the very best that it can be.**

1332270475.0,25,self.AdvancedRunning,r5h3j,Race Report: LA Marathon,Wyoming_Knott,27,2,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/r5h3j/race_report_la_marathon/,"Raced the LA Marathon on Sunday, so here's some deets about my preparation, the race, and some post thoughts.

I've been running for about 5 years, the last 4 or so have been more serious, but I don't have any high school or collegiate history of pure running, so it's been a process.

**Pre Race**

I decided last year that I wanted to go sub 3 in a marathon this year, and 18 weeks seemed like a good amount of time to prepare for it, so I followed Hal Higdon's Advanced 1 plan to add some structure to my normally unstructured mileage.  My long runs were at around 7:45 to 8 minute pace, tempo around 6:20, and track repeats at 6 min pace (Yasso 800 pace).  I peaked in training at about 62 miles per week, with a couple weeks in the mid fifties and a few weeks in the high 30s to high 40s.  I'll post my training log when I get home, can't access imgur at work.

I hit my last long run 3 weeks out from the race, and it was a smooth 20.  Felt great, nutrition was solid, and finished feeling relaxed, so I was ready for a recovery week, and 2 weeks of taper.  Recovery week was around 42 miles with a solid hill workout in the middle of it, first taper week was 30 miles with a set of 90 second 400s in the middle, and race week was 12 miles, pretty much all easy with a few 400m shake outs on Tuesday and full rest Thursday/Friday.  Thurs/Fri/Sat consisted of a lot of time with my legs up on the couch reading, to make sure they were resting and loosening up.

Nutrition-wise during the week, I focused on carbohydrates like pasta, and potatoes, protein like chicken, and some fruits and veggies, like salad, banana, apple, and OJ.  I made sure I had enough food to eat any time that I felt hungry, and made sure my meals consisted of at least a source of complex carbs and a source of lean protein.  My calorie consumption seemed reasonable without being ridiculous, in terms of how full I felt and how often I was hungry.  I haven't even counted calories, so no quantitative data on that front.  I also carried a water bottle around with me everywhere I went to make sure I followed a diligent hydration plan, but I pretty much do this anyway.

**Race Day**

Race Day at LA Marathon is brutal if you don't stay at a hotel or have friends to drop you off.  It's point to point, so you have to park at the finish and take a shuttle up to the start.  The race starts around 7:30 and the last shuttle leaves for it's 45 minute journey at 5:30.  I arrived early and got on the 4:30 shuttle, so I ended up sitting around for about 30 minutes until I began my warmup at 5:45.  Luckily it was recommended to bring throwaway jackets/pants that they would donate for you after the race, so I was plenty warm (it was about 40 deg F outside).

Warmup consisted of a lap around Dodger Stadium, 4 sets of strides, some dynamic stretching, and another lap.  Then I checked gear and got into the starting corral with about 45 mins to go.

My nutrition plan was as such: 6 gels total, 1 20 mins before gun, 1 20 mins after gun, and every 30 from there on out.  This had seemed to work for me on a 30k trail race I did in January.  They had water every mile, so I opted to drink a gulp of water every mile to try and stay hydrated but not have to pee.

After all the starting hoopla and a lot of too-loud announcer babble (speaker was literally next to my starting corral, and had to be loud enough for 23,000 racers to hear...ugh), the race set up to go approximately on time.

Gun went off and I started settled in to what I felt was a decent pace.  The start is a short uphill followed by a couple miles of steep downhill, so I was trying to dial my effort (heart rate) to match my flat race pace miles that I did during training.  This seemed to work OK, but my first mile was 6:14, followed by a 6:27, but my heart rate seemed to be at a reasonable level, so I was OK with going that quickly.  The course flattened out midway through the 2nd mile, and I tried to settle onto a 6:45 or so pace, but it felt a bit difficult.  Additionally, I felt drowsy.  I decided that I was just cold from the downhill (at this point I was wearing running shorts, singlet, headband and gloves) and pushed through, but my heart rate was not settling out, and the uphill had started around mile 3.5.

I hit the 10k mark at 42 minutes even which felt good because the end of the course featured a lot of false flat and some big downhills, so just under 7 minute splits over the initial hills seemed reasonable.  Soon after this, however, I got passed by a 'Sub 3' group from a local running club, and decided to hop in a draft down Sunset Blvd. which was a little windy.  This only lasted for about 2 miles, or just after the 9 mile mark, because they were clicking off 6:40 pace, which was not going to be sustainable for me, and we hit 9 miles just over 1 hour in.

I let them go, and kept on trying to click off between 6:50 and 7:10 miles, depending on the slope of the course.  I hit the halfway mark at 1:28, and had just started to feel like this was about to turn into a sufferfest.  My heart rate was still 8-10 BPM too high (higher than similarly paced 10 milers in training), and my legs were starting to show signs of cracks.  I had already made the decision that I was gonna hit splits and make 3 hours, or blow up in epic fashion trying, so my race plan was to keep it up until blowing up.  And that's pretty much exactly what happened.

Mile 17 started to get hard, but it was uphill, as was some of 18, but my splits were 7:14, 7:09 so I was relatively on track still.  Mile 19 is where things started to fall apart.  Pushing through leg pain and burn is nothing new to me, that's pretty much par for the course if you wanna be a fast runner, I suppose, but I had never had stomach problems before, and my stomach started to cramp, hard.  I was starting to have trouble breathing because of the cramping, but I pushed through 19 at 7:40, but 20 slowed to 8:40, and I had to stop for a few seconds to try and shake out the cramps because it felt like my stomach was getting stabbed, which made it really tough to breathe.

If you've ever been in that situation where you've got a long way to go and you're in a lot of pain, you know the feeling of thinking, ""Shit, this is gonna be a really shitty portion of time.""  10k of pain feels like forever, haha.  Nothing of note happened in the last 6.2 of the race except that I either had to walk/run or stop to let the cramps subside.  I was pissed.  Mostly because I thought I could handle any pain running would throw at me, but the stomach cramp/breathing thing was a new one, and I did not handle it well.  I at my 5th Gu over the course of a mile or so, but I couldn't handle the 6th later on.

I knew I had no chance at 3:00, but I thought if I could close just under 8 minute miles I might hit 3:05, but after 20 went by at 8:42 and 21 went by at 9:04, I kept having to revise my estimated finishing time.  What ended up getting me is that a guy I know, who I'm faster than, had run a 3:30 at California International last year, so I didn't wanna get beat by him, even though I was in the midst of an epic blow up.  My last miles were between 8:45 and 12 minutes, depending on the terrain, but I clocked in around 3:26 at the finish.

**Post Race**

I stumbled forward for a while, got the medal and heat blanket, etc. but the water and nutrition were a long city block from the finish, and it took forever to get there.  I drank some water and ate a couple bites of a banana, which did not sit well, and my abs started to cramp/spasm, which was an interesting feeling.

Finally made it to my car and home, slept for like 2 hours and then mowed down a Chipotle burrito, followed by a burger and fries about 4 hours later.

Monday my legs were a wreck.  Hips hurt, quads and hams sore, back hurt, felt like an old man, haha.  Went for a 2 mile walk after work yesterday, and now today feel a lot better, but am gonna stay off running for another day and maybe try a couple miles easy tomorrow.

The whole experience was humbling to say the least.  I was confident that I could hit 3, even though LA is not the best course to do it on, and I had my ass handed to me.  It was an epic though, and I've thought a lot about it in the last couple days.  What can I do to avoid these problems in the future?  How can I avoid stomach problems, etc.  For one, I think I need more miles.  High 30s for off weeks and a peak of 62 seems like too low.  In hindsight, Hal Higdon is known for his philosophy of undertraining, so perhaps I should have hopped up to the Advanced 2 plan, or looked at other plans like Jack Daniels or Pfitzinger.

On a more holistic aspect, I took this race more seriously than I've taken any race since I was racing bicycles super seriously 10 years ago.  I didn't drink alcohol for 2 weeks before hand, my taper was huge, comparatively, to any other tapers I've done for past races, and I had everything planned out, splits, nutrition, hydration, etc.  One of my friends suggested that I had taken it too seriously and perhaps I was over-amped and under-stoked, which could have caused the elevated heart rate that I didn't see in race pace training runs, and have subconsciously affected me.  I don't know if that is the case, but it could be, so maybe I will take a slightly more relaxed approach to my next race.

Next race I think will be Santa Rosa Marathon in August.  It's flat and fast and the date gives me a month of recovery from this race followed by 16 weeks of training to prepare for another sub 3 bid.

Feel free to provide feedback.  I'm all ears for improving my training and racing.

If  someone in the front pack goes down, no one else is going to stop for them.  

Today I ran my second half marathon.  Unfortunately, due to very bad training and being ill, I was in terrible shape (final time:  2:03:36).  This was very far from my last time of 1:14:20.  So being so far behind today I got to experience something that I never have before, the pack of the pack.  And I would just like to say thank you to the at least 200 people that tried to help me get through the race today by stopping, chatting with me, giving advice, or in other ways being awesome people..

I'm nowhere near good enough to run for a win, this is very much a personal challenge to finish!

I normally run 40-50 miles/week mostly commuting to work including a weekend longer run at the moment of 10-15 miles although I'm happy running up to 30 at a stretch.

3 weekends, 3 marathons - 2:50 (Steamtown); 3:03 (Hartford); 2:58 (Monster Mash). 

The final act in this three part comedy concluded at the Monster Mash Marathon in quaint Dover, Delaware. This is a fantastically awesome 2nd year race that will attract thousands in the coming years. Great people, awesome venue (Dover International Speedway 
- the first mile is on the race track!!) on probably the flattest marathon course in the history of marathoning. The only ""hill"" is at mile 26.2 when you cross the timing mat. I'm not joking. 

I found this race post Hartford when I needed something to give me a shot at winning my running club's Athlete of the Week. 

This marathon road trip was arguably the zaniest of the three that I've taken so far in the past month. For some unknown reason my brother wanted to go with me. Fact: we haven't been on a road trip, or really hung out together, since high school (15+ years ago). He's also never seen me race. Ever. This was going to be special. 

We started the 6 hr drive at 5:30PM on Friday, and we were in Dover by midnight, and gambling in the local casino by 12:30AM. We had absolutely no lodging plans. We were going to do this old school (i.e. on the cheap). 

After leaving the casino a little after 12:34AM, and a fistful of dollars lighter, we made the short drive to the marathon start line and fell asleep...in the car. 

I woke up a few hours later, got dressed, took a dump, had a muffin, and toed the line. 

We started with the half-marathoners, and the marathon standings were pretty much set right from the get go. I ran much of the race in 4th-5th (got passed at mile 19). 

I suffered a calf-crap at mile 7 that never loosened up. I thought my day was done, but I just blocked it all out for the remaining 19 miles. 

It was really peaceful and serene to be out in the Delaware countryside as the sun was coming up (almost like a very hard training run). 

It got a little warm, but nothing drastic. Plenty of water stops, and oddly, every water stop had GU. Overkill. I ended up taking 4 GU's just to keep my head in the race. 

My only moment of despair was around mile 16 when I had to take a really bad shit. Fortunately, there was a port-a-john at mile 17. I felt much, much better (and lighter) after unloading. 

This run was very similar to my Sugarloaf run when I also ran 2:58 and broke 3 hrs for the first time back in 2010. 

I had to dig deep for the final 10K to get under 3 hours, but told myself that I had 44 minutes to do it. My 10K PR is 36:01. No sweat. 

I managed to finish strong (6:30 last mile) to cross the line in 5th overall and with less than 2 minutes to spare. In the process knocking off Delaware from the sub-3 hour/50 states list. 

Winning time at this race last year was 3:14. I think the top 20 people today were all under 3:14. 

Had a blast spending time with my brother/cameraman. We're thinking Texas next weekend....

1374178494.0,20,self.AdvancedRunning,1ikzn5,Racing Strategy: Should I Positive or Negative Split a Road 5k,VaguelyRobot,22,2,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ikzn5/racing_strategy_should_i_positive_or_negative/,"After the recent post with some saying there is not enough training/racing discussion on this thread, I figured I'd ask a question and hopefully start a chat.  

Is it better to positive split (go out hard) or negative split (go out conservatively) in a road 5k?

My Thoughts:
I'm not totally convinced which strategy is best to run a fast time.  Tactical championship racing is a whole other discussion.  I'm talking about how to post good times.  800m runners (Rudisha and Solomon, etc) tend to positive split their races even at championships.  Milers I have seen go either way.  Most 5k track races I have seen people tend to negative split although most races I have seen are championship races, so I don't know how relevant that is.  I have always thought that to break out of a plateau and make a jump forward you should try to go out hard.  However, there is something about going out a tad conservatively and finishing hard that can really work well sometimes.

My background (why I am asking):

I was an 800m runner in college and am now trying to make my race the 5k for the first time.  I have discovered I don't really know how to properly race one.  I'm at the point in my training where my time should start to drop, but I'm stuck in the 15:50's.  I feel faster so the last few races I have gone out in 15 flat pace only to die off, so I'm thinking maybe I should change it up.

Twists:

What about a flat course, a rolling course, a course with a big hill (beginning or end)?  Does it matter if it is a race with a pack of runners who are faster or a race where I will be totally alone after twenty seconds?

What are your thoughts r/advancedrunning? How did you run your fastest time in a road 5k?  What was the course like, what was the competition like, and what were your splits?  I don't think there is one correct answer for every person, but there can be pro's and con's for each side.

Edit:  Real life twist.  I have [this course](http://www.usatf.org/routes/view.asp?rID=520696) coming up.  What would be your strategy on this elevation profile?  100m climb total pretty much meandering down on the first half and then back up on the second half.",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,1374189517.0,,,True,t3_1ikzn5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ikzn5/racing_strategy_should_i_positive_or_negative/,

1359033287.0,21,self.AdvancedRunning,176rcv,Speed during base/early track?,Awarenesss,24,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/176rcv/speed_during_baseearly_track/,"In 2003, Racer1 posted this on the thread ""Basic speed, or why am I so damn slow?"" on LetsRun.com:
________________________________

""Improving basic speed is fairly simple. The scenario I've seen many times is this. Let me introduce you to runner ""Joe.""

Joe is 27 years old, was decent but no better in H.S., tried to make the cross-country/track team at the local university but was unsuccessful. Joe ran 10:00 in the 3200 in H.S., and now runs local road races with an average 5k of 17:30. Joe runs about 40 miles a week and does intervals in the form of 800m and mile repeats in fartlek form with the local club.

Joe can no longer come close to a 10:00 3200. He can't do this because 5:00 for the mile is all he can muster. An 800m in 2:20 is a race for him.

Joe has 2 big problems that are equally important to address 1) Lack of mileage, 2) No speed. Joe, however has decided he wants some more success and is willing to work for it.

I look at his recent mileage and plot out a course for raising it. We go to the track and warm-up etc. and I put him through a small true speed workout. I have him run what I call an ""accela 200."" He starts out at mile race pace and builds speed over 200 meters until the last 20-30 are full out. This is always the final component of the warm-up and the beginning of the workout on a true speed day.

Because he has not done any true speed work since high school he will run 1 or 2 200s. I give him 5 minutes recovery and explain that he will run this next 200 as fast as possible while staying relaxed. He jogs into it with a raised hand, which is dropped when the 200 start is reached. As the hand drops I click my watch and observe. The effort to relax is apparent but he is not relaxed and isn't generating a lot of power. The time is 29.3. He walks a bit, jogs a 600 back to the start where I meet him and ask how he is feeling etc (rest was about 8 min). We decide to do another one. Same procedure, 29.7.

I let him know that he will be sore etc. but that his speed will improve. This workout is repeated once a week with the number of 200s increased to 5 after the accela 200. The recovery is whatever is necessary (within reason) to be ready to go again. Usually starts at about 8 minutes and drops to 5 minutes after a couple months. It is never reduced to less then 5.

Joe's progression.

Week 1: 29.3, 29.7
Week 2: 28.8, 28.5, 29.1
Week 3: 28.5, 28.4, 28.6, 28.8
Week 4: 28.1, 28.0, 28.3, 28.3, 29.2
Week 5: 28.2, 28.5, 28.4, 28.5, 28.4
Week 6: 27.7, 27.6, 28.0, 28.1, 27.3
(Finally gets around to buying a pair of spikes to use instead of road flats. The last 200 of week 6 was run in spikes. Joe put them on for strides 2 times during the week. He has not been sore so the last 3 will be run in spikes on week 7. Week 8 will be completely in spikes.)
Week 7: 27.5, 27.6, 27.0, 26.8, 26.6
Week 8: 26.9, 26.5, 26.4, 26.7, 26.2
Week 9: 26.3, 26.1, 26.0, 26.6, 25.9
Week 10:25.9, 26.3, 26.1, 25.9, 25.8

(During this time mileage was raised from 40-70)

This Joe levels off about here, two Joes I have coached progressed to the mid 24's, another is currently at about week 6. All Joes increased their mileage and threshold running and dropped up there 5k times substantially--and didn't get outkicked at the end. In less than a year Joe is now running 15:30 for 5k and 4:28 for a mile.

FOR MOST SPEED IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

If muscle imbalances are present drills are introduced to correct them. Usually the speed will fix them if it is run relaxed. Drills and plyos can be helpful but usually distract from the speed and a loss of specificity is incurred. Ability for 400 meter usually starts at 61-62 and drops to 53-55.

Don't over complicate things. Don't excessively worry about drills and form. Just do it and do it relaxed. Devote 1 workout a week to speed until you start to level off. After you level off finish 1 to 2 workouts per week with 1-2 fast 200s. For most people that is enough to maintain speed and some see continued improvement.

I like 200s because those are short enough to sprint but long enough to focus on relaxation.

Some may do it different, however this works so I stick with it.

My favorite athlete to work with is one who was a B class runner in HS, showing some talent, but never developed for one reason or another. For example I am working with an 800m runner who ran 2:00 flat in HS, 2:00 as a freshman in college and then quit. This guy will never make a U.S. national team but just wants to see improvement. Two weeks ago he raced for the 1st time in 5 years, the first time ever indoors, at 4500 feet, and 1 week after the highest mileage week of his life, and without a preparatory time trial, no hard 600's etc. He PRd with 1:59 FAT. He will peak for outdoors and run much faster. The two MAJOR factors? More mileage. More speed.""
___________________________________________

Do you think this is a bad idea to do, like he said, once a week during my base/early track season? I run 7 days a week, 1 longer run, 1 recovery, 3 easy, 2 workouts, and would add these on when I feel it is okay to do so. I ask this because I have always thought the more anaerobic stuff (i.e. 200', 100's, etc) should be done when tapering. I tried posting it there, but only got one response.

Male/15, could probably, all out, go 27 high in the 200, and maybe 60ish in 400. Specialty is the mile. Thanks in advance! Any questions please ask.

So I've recently hit 70-80 mpw, and have discovered that managing taking a shit has become a whole different story. Typically running in the morning, I could take a dump right when I woke up and would totally be good to go. I'd maybe take one more in the afternoon, but otherwise all would be well.

Now I'm finding I can take a decent dump before a run, but then need to take another one immediately after the run, sometimes with the urge coming at the tail-end of a 8 miler or maybe a long-run. I assume this is mainly due to the increase in eating that I've been doing at the new mileage. Obviously a lot more calories in means a lot more waste out. I have a marathon next month though, so I'm curious now about how to best time these things to ensure that I'll be running light. My approach last race was a dump in the morning the day before, at night the day before, immediately after waking up the day of the race, and then shortly before the race. Worked awesomely.

So what are your guys' bathroom routines like? Do you have a typical approach, is it spontaneous, do you have tips for getting into a new habit? etc.

Anyway, it made a big impact on me but the next day I couldn't for the life of me remember where I found it. I'm fairly sure it was linked in the comments on this board, but I've absolutely scoured the threads that I thought the comment was in, as well as pages upon pages of search results, to no avail. I was wondering if anyone was familiar with the article I'm talking about, and hopefully has a link.

Some details that might seem familiar to anyone who's read it: this guy talked about an up-and-down (but mostly-down) career in college plagued by injuries and disappointing times. He described some workouts where he would go balls-out on the final reps, not for any reason but because he was obsessed with the idea of having ""worked hard.""

Horrible. (I had to run the JV race, kicked off of varsity last race)

I did my strides, did no running at all to rest, slept well and everything, for the past 4 days since saturday like you guys told me to.

I got to the meet feeling very good and pumped to run, the gun goes off and i stay in 3rd place then lead up to 1st after about half a mile, and I hit the first mile around 6:00, I am feeling pretty good then all of a sudden heavyness hits me in the legs and i drop down to 2nd/3rd place (I was also a idiot and didn't use my spikes for all grassy course, I believed one major reason for my horrible races were my spikes but it backfired)

So I am on the 2nd mile now and kids just start to catch up to me, and I am in 5th now around 1.5 to go and 2 more catch me so i am in 7th around the 2mile mark.

I then catch up to the pack of 3-6th place runners and start to pass them but then the heavyness of my legs kick in again, and my pace just slows down, i stayed close to that pack in 7th throughout the rest of the race and finished in 22:06. As my final race of my senior year doing this for my third year, and all the hardwork I did over the summer, 6,000 miles of gas due to i live 30miles from the school, so 30 there 30 back, 60, and its been 100 days of practice i've been doing for sure so far, all for nothing I will not be apart of the district team next saturday, first time in 7years we might go to regionals as a team.

I feel as if I wasted these past 5 months doing nothing, at the beginning of the season I was so strong, and could do anything my coach told me to. Now if I tried to do 20 400's I probably would only make it to 8. I only PR'ed in the 400 pretty much this XC season which was 58-&gt; 56s.

Overall I bawled like a baby for the first time in years on the car drive home, this whole situation is surreal to me and very frustrating. What do you guys suggest I do?

My two options are:

1. 2-3 week break, then do winter conditioning with my track coaches (sprinting oriented, going to be working on speed/muscle (lifting weights, i am naturally fast and can run a 24-25s 200)

2. CA friend online, his coach will be willing to design a workout for me to do over the course of 9 weeks this inc winter. I am mainly going to be racing the 800 and maybe the mile (best mile time was 5:28 but 800 was 2:13) or even the 400.

I ran my first marathon using Higdons Intermediate program, but have since moved on to Daniel's running formula on the recommendation of lots of better runners than me.

One thing that seems to stick out as a point of difference between the two is the length of the long run - Higdon has multiple 20 milers (which make up nearly 50% of weekly mileage in some weeks), whereas Daniels only prescribes 2.5 hours max for a total of 33% of weekly mileage (whichever is less).

At my current easy pace I can only cover just over 15 miles in 2.5 hours.

I signed up for Boston using this time and at this year's race (2013) I ran 2:34 after following the 85+ mile per week plan. This was the highest mileage plan in the book. I added mileage on here and there during my training, averaging around 100 miles per week over 18 weeks and peaked around 112 miles per week.

I feel like I have not reached my full potential in the marathon and would like to keep improving, and hopefully get under the 2:30 mark. I'm currently registered for another marathon in November and plan on running Boston again in 2014. My only problem now is that I don't really know how I should change my training before my next marathon in November to try and improve. I've already followed the most advanced plan in the book, and haven't been able to find another book that offers a better plan. I hope some of you are familiar with the plans in ""Advanced Marathoning.""

Here are my thoughts on what I was planning on doing for my fall marathon training to try and improve:

1) Higher Mileage: add more to my medium long runs and aerobic runs, and only slightly increase recovery runs and long runs. Running 100-112 MPW wasn't as challenging as I expected it would be, so I think I could try and peak around 130-140 MPW next time around.

2) More strength training in the off season. This summer I would like to strengthen my quads and continue this strengthening a little bit during my marathon training as well. At Boston last weekend my quads were the only muscles that were very noticeably fatigued towards the end and were extremely sore after the race. Nothing else was sore the next day at all. I attribute this to the down hills. I had no trouble on the uphills in Newton, but ended up slowing on the down hills during the last 10k. I ran ~3 minute positive split during the race because of quad issues.

3) A little more marathon-pace training runs. During my training for Boston I attempted 3 marathon pace training runs. Two of which were early in the training cycle and I could not hit my goal marathon pace for those two. I only had one workout where I was able to run close to my goal marathon training pace for an extended time during a long run. I had no problems with the lactate threshold runs.

4) Use a heart rate monitor during my marathon training to make sure I am putting in the appropriate effort during certain workouts and recovery runs.

What do you guys think of these ideas? Do you think I am capable of a sub 2:30 marathon in November after running a 17 minute PR during my last race?

I run now as a hobby and I really want to work in the running industry when I'm done with the AF.

Then, right at 5:00 on the dot, they wordlessly jogged over to this big man in a polo shirt with a stop watch, jogged to the 200meter line and cranked out a 23 second 200. They pulled off, jogged 50 meters back out and each did a second finisher. Between each rep they would super slowly jog back to the 200 line, pause to look at the guy with the stopwatch and then crank out another super-consistent performance.

Some of you might remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/r5h3j/race_report_la_marathon/) post about my experience at LA Marathon this year, and my goal of a sub 3 hour marathon, so if you care to read, that will preface the first portion of this year in my running life.

Me:

27, Male, 6'1"", 180 lb.

**Preparation**

After the LA Marathon and the disappointing result due to unforseen stomach cramps, I was pretty amped to get back on the horse and add more fitness.  Tried to get an easy 3 in the Wednesday after the race, but my left glute (specifically what I think is the piriformis?) felt really sore, so they weren't the easiest miles I've ever run.  Took another week off and tried for Wednesday the following week with similar results.  I was on my bike putting in mileage and that felt good, so I left running at 1 run per week for the month after the race, and just hit significant bike miles until 2 weeks before a Half-Iron that I race every year.  Took 1 whole week off of everything, then eased into the race and felt good, so I knew I could get back into it.

There were a lot of great suggestions for things that I could do to improve my fitness in the comments of my last race report and one of the most common was: more mileage.  The thought was that peaking at a 62 mile week wasn't enough to hit sub 3.  I took this to heart, looked around, and decided that I wanted to use Pfitzinger's [18 week/70 mile](http://runningtimes.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=4432&amp;PageNum=5) plan.  Off the bat, however, I had to hack out 2 weeks because I didn't have 18 weeks.  Additionally, my summer schedule of traveling was hectic to say the least, so I knew I wasn't going to be able to be as regimented as I was for LA, but this fit well with my attitude about my next cycle of training.

Before LA, I gave up everything, pretty much.  Almost no partying, few missed runs, no biking...essentially I was a ghost to a lot of my buddies because I was sacrificing my normal social life for my running goals.

After LA, and the uncharacteristic elevated heart rate I exhibited, I tried to think of reasons that I would have been psyched out and over-amped about the race.  One of the conclusions that I came to is that I was training too much 'by the book'.  'The Book' (mileage, long run tempo, speed work, etc.) is the gospel, but it's gotta be tailored to the individual, so I resolved to continue riding and give up less social events, but also retain consistency and diligence on the run-mileage and quality front.

The major changes I made to my training from the LA Marathon plan were as such: I rode by bike at least once a week for hard interval sets or long epics, not because I am a big fan of cross training or thought that I'd get injured, but because I love hammering on my bike, chasing breaks, Tour de France, blah blah most of you don't care. Despite the unconventional workout or two during the week, I kept my long run, and at least 1 tempo type run of medium distance (10-12).  My favorite Pfitz workouts were the Lactate Threshold workouts such as '12 miles with 6 miles tempo'.  I chose LT as my major focus, because keeping speed for 26.2 was the goal.  The second major change was that, I added hills to my long runs, and more hill repeats in general.  The idea here was to give me some more muscle strength to deal with inclines so that I would not burn as much of my tank on any hills or accelerations.  The final major change was my long run pace.  Several commenters in the LA report suggested that my long runs were too slow.  I agreed, and decided to start my long runs around 8 min/mile (where I trained for LA), but end around 7 min/mile, or close to race pace.  This helped simulate back end fatigue and holding pace through it (which would come in handy later).

**Taper and Race**

Nutrition during the week of race was pretty standard.  Good balance of carbs, protein and fat.  Pretty much staying healthy and working to keep the stomach healthy and muscle glycogen topped off.  Race taper was not as standard.  One of the suggestions from the LA Marathon report comments was that my taper was too long.  I agreed with this as well, because I was feeling ancy going into the race.  I feel like I should feel calm and rested, but not ancy, like I want to get more miles.  I spend 9 days total in my taper, which included a 7 mile race pace run 8 days out, an 8 mile easy run 6 days out, a 4 mile run with 3x100m strides 5 days out, 5 miles with 2 at race pace, a rest day, 3 miles easy, and a rest day before the race.  Lots of flexibility work, in there, but no stretching for the 2 days before the race in order to let the muscles heal fully (another lesson from LA: I felt like I had no 'pop', and I think it's because I stretched some/at all before the race, which has been shown to decrease performance).

Race day went off pretty well.  Got up, ate 2 hours before the gun, got ready, drove to the venue with my buddy, warmed up, dropped a great pre-game deuce and cruised to the starting line with about 10 minutes to spare.  It's a 1000 person race, and the park where everything was located was adjacent to the starting line, so it was easy to literally just step in with the faster runners at the line.  Turns out the 3:00 group was the first group anyway.

When the gun went off, I hopped in with the 3-hour group and started clicking off miles.  The pace felt fast, but I kept with it because I felt fresh, but when we hit mile 1 at 6:37, I decided to back it off to mid 6:40s.  The 3-hour group moved up a bit, and I settled in pace next to another guy, who also was wearing a GPS watch, and we cruised along until the halfway point together.  Joining us over miles 2-5 or so were several people, and we ended up in a group of about 5-7 people pacing for around the 3 hour mark.

At this point, my mind was clouded with doubt.  So much shit can happen on the back stretch of a marathon (and at my experience level, I don't know enough to extrapolate my leg feeling in the beginning to what is going to happen at the end) that every little bit of fatigue I felt in the first 13.1 worried me.  I was questioning how much of a suffer-fest it was going to be and thinking back to 8 miles of shitstorm at the end of LA (haha, I'm referencing LA Marathon a lot...can you tell I've only run 2 marathons?).  Surprisingly enough, though, the first of two 13.1 mile laps was uneventful, other than I dropped the last 2 of my 4 salt tablets somewhere when I pulled out a Gu (buffered salt tabs: part of my stomach cramp mitigation plan).  Luckily it was 55 degrees and cloudy for literally the whole race...awesome!  While I'm on the stomach cramp mitigation plan topoic: the other plan was to drink an adequate amount of water.  LA Race Report comments determined that I was probably dehydrated a bit and that I was not consuming enough water for sufficient gastric emptying, which cause my stomach lockup.  I agreed with this diagnosis, so I planned in some H20 for the course.  At mile 11 I grabbed a half bottle of Gu Rocktane drink from my friend.  This is about 135 calories of electrolytes and carbs, so  little more than 1 Gu, but in a more easily digested format.  This was key.

**February: 289.9 miles (72.5 mpw)**

breakdown:

easy/recovery/WU/CD: 63.7%

speedwork (incl. recovery jogs): 14.2%, avg of 6.5 miles of quality per workout

long runs: 19.6% (three 15ers, one 11er)

tempo: 1.7% (just one 5mi tempo, atypical)

race: 0.7% (just a 3000m and 400m)

**January 302.9 mi (68.4 mpw)** 

breakdown:

easy/recovery/WU/CD: 66.0%

long runs: 17.5% (four 13.3mi avg)

speedwork: 6.3% (not much, base building)

tempo (incl. fartleks w/very short recovery): 9.2%

race: 1.0% (one 5k race, 85% effort)

2 of my best months probably. most consistent mileage i have ever done, with a solid buildup from longer workouts down to speedwork. more speedwork is to come next month as i begin to race more.

I am training for the 5000m distance, but want to perform well from 1500m to 10,000m. goal is 15:59 5k by june

This year I'll be coaching the 11-12 year old boys. I won't pretend that I'm a qualified coach. I run a lot, enjoy running a lot, and the club needs volunteers to coach. So here I am.

One kid in particular is a standout runner. He is crazy about running, has unbelievable heart and talent, and last year (as he turned 11) he broke many of the club records (2:25 800, 5:20 1600). He wants to run run run run.

He's coming off soccer season now, and track is around the corner. I'd love to get him doing some gentle workouts now so he doesn't start from scratch on the season as he did last year. More to the point, HE'S itching to run now. But I have concerns about a kid his age putting in too many miles.

Looking back through the history of the program, a lot of early talent seemed to fizzle out as they grew up. Whether that's due to them losing interest, burning out, or getting injured from over-training, I'd like to avoid the pitfalls.

Any sage advice from the AR crowd on coaching an enthusiastic and talented 12 year old? 800 and 1600 are his real strengths, although as he progressed last year he showed some interest in the 3200 as well.

Having said that...

Training has been well, peaked at 80 mpw, overtapered a bit because I was feeling a bit sore in the shin and didn't want shin splints/stress fracture. Day before the race, good breakfast. Lunch I had a 32oz Vanilla Hulk from smoothie king (favorite smoothie ever, 1300 calories, loaded with carbs, good amount of protein, just all around goodness). Dinner I had a smaller than usual serving of pasta, didn't want my usual mt. everest size plate. 

Wake up morning of race a bit late because I'm an idiot and set my alarm for 4:30 am Monday not 4:30 am Saturday. So now it's 5:20. Eat half a bagel and one boiled egg with a little salt. Couldn't eat anymore, stomach was being lame. Felt fine and strong. Got to the race around 6:20. I had a parking pass to park very close (15,000 person race between the 5k, 10k, half, and full). Did like a 3 minute warm up just so I didn't shock my legs when the gun went off. I had to pee about five minutes before the race and it was decently yellow but I shrugged it off. 

Race starts and I go out with the previous years winner, Dr. Mark Cucuzzella who I am VERY fond of. 45 year old and a incredibly consistent runner. We go like 6:30 for the first mile, 6:33 for the second mile (which has a huge uphill), 5:47 for the 3rd mile which has a massive downhill, and then we settle into some 6:00-6:03's. We're popping them off no problem and so casually they we were doing quite a bit of talking. It was just me, Mark, and one of Mark's friends. Then come mile 11 Mark had to stop and use the Portajohn, so that left me and his friend, we quickly passed 6th place and then caught 5th place and ran with him. From miles 11-18 we ran mostly 5:55's to 6:01's. And then it happened. Almost immediately at the start of the 19th mile My legs went to shit, it was incredibly fast, with no warnings. I struggled to put out at a 6:30 for that mile. I managed to toughen up and put down a 6:20 for the 20th mile but this was becoming unbearable. And the sad thing is, the 19th and 20th miles are my favorite two miles of that entire course, I run those two miles anywhere from 5-8 times a week. I was so excited to hit them thinking, this will be my time to shine cause I'm so comfortable with them.  Well that was not the case. About a quarter mile into the 21st mile I had to walk for about 10 meters, I shook out my legs and then started running again. About a half mile later was the water stop. When I got there I stopped and drank for about 90 seconds before trying to run again. I'm in 7th place now out of 5500. But really quickly my friend Mark came running by and told me to relax (I don't think he knew what was happening). The problem with the last part of the 21st mile and the start of the 22nd mile is that it is an overpass. It was agonizing making my way up that overpass alone. All the half marathoners were on the otherside of the road separated by a concrete divider. And here is this lone marathoner, now in 8th place, moving slower than these half marathoners. I was in huge trouble. I had to walk again and barely made it to the top of the hill. Finally I peaked on the hill, walked for about 50 meters and then ran down the overpass and about a third of a mile later was the mile 22 water stop with a medical station. I intended only to eat a half banana and have some gatorade but I was shaking so hard that I had to sit down. After about 10 minutes of sitting they encouraged me to take an IV. I was shivering really hard and my legs were shaking very badly. After the IV which took about 50 minutes all said and done, I was still shivering really bad. The doctor said the sudden onset + how I looked + how bad I was shivering even though I was 22 miles into a marathon + how cold I was to the touch = severe dehydration. So there you have it, I blew my marathon by being severely dehydrated. I waited around for about 30 minutes after the IV, so about 80 minutes in total at mile 22. Before finally taking off and jogging the last 4.2 miles to a 4:13:XX. 

I was pretty devastated. 8 months of training and it seemed wasted by such an amateur mistake. I took a bit of water/gatorade at every stop in the race too. I ended up breaking down about 25 minutes later and honestly just cried for a few minutes. 

Spent a lot of time thinking about it yesterday and then decided I still needed a Boston Qualifier and I have the connections to get a slot even if the race is full, so I decided to run the Marshall University Marathon in 8 weeks from today. I'm going to use the Advanced Marathoning 8 week schedule. Add a few more miles than it has and give this whole thing another go. 

This time I will definitely hydrate more the day before, the morning of, and if I have to, stop and drink at each station if it means I won't have a body failure at 18-22 miles. I also might toy around with the idea of salt pills or something which will keep sodium in my body because as we all know sodium keeps water in you. 

So yea, that's where I stand. 8 months of training for the big day and it was a disaster. It was honestly one of the most painful things i've ever felt. Walking up an overpass as hundreds of half marathoners just stared at me while I thought I was going to die. It was a great lesson learned though and I really hope none of you ever have to go through anything like it. 

I'll edit to clarify anything if need be. 

Good luck training guys and I'm now 8 weeks away from my next marathon (unfortunately) :p.

Using google, I can't tell which plans are better than others. 

**TL;DR - Sub 19m 5k, how do?** 

What I've gathered so far is I should have 

* 1-2 long runs (this distance varies from 6 miles to 90 minute runs... I was thinking 6-8 miles? 

* 30 minute Tempo run

* Speed work, increasing laps or distance from week to week

* 1 or 2 recovery runs

So all in all 5-6 runs a week. 

I'm currently training for an olympic triathlon in august and a couple cycling races in september. I figured I would continue with my 10k training until august, take sept easy, base build with hills and long slow runs in october &amp; november and get working into speed about 12-18 weeks from race day? 

For some perspective, when I run my 800m intervals currently I'm at around 3:06-3:15 depending on the day.

The race is indoors, on 304m track and I don't think the fastest are running under 4 minutes.
A bit of background about myself. I'm 22 years old and I started running this past summer. So far I've made solid progress, running my 5k at 18:25 (track) and 10k 39:15 (street). I'm always a bit of slow starter but finish strong and I think I've got a high pain threshold.

Update:

I did miserably. Finishing 4:51 to second place, 6 seconds behind the winner. I felt like an utter failure, and to be honest still do and that is because I really thought I could go for the 4:30.

I really don't want to find any other explanation for my poor result other than sucking but still..

So I went and did 3* 200m, 2* 300m, 400m, and the same distances coming down, accelerating pyramid exercise on Tuesday just to experience the speed. I went all out, finishing my final 200m well under 30sec. The exercise was quite hard for me and I felt the effects yesterday. I had sore legs and felt that I just wasn't on top of my game.

The race was 5 laps (well almost because the track was 304m). First lap was on schedule but I started falling behind a lot already on the second lap. I was able to kick the final lap almost for the right time though. I just couldn't handle the speed I think.

An intriguing race popped up on the local race calendar that I am seriously considering. It is a trail 50k in early February. I am looking for some input on if I should go for it or stick to my shorter races, so here is my background and pros/cons:

Background: I am two years removed from running D1 and was able to handle 70-80 miles a week (in season, 90-100+ during the summer). Currently I am on a long road back from a pretty bad knee injury from the summer of 2011. I started slowing building back up in June of this year. I am up to 30-40 miles a week with a long run between 11-14 miles but no speed/strength workouts. I did the 11 in 78 minutes and the 14 in an hour 38. Since injuring my knee I've only done 3 races (1 mile and two 5ks) with the most recent being a 5k in 16:20 at the beginning of the month. In college I was an 800/1500 guy during track (built for speed).

Pros: The race is only $40, which from what I hear is pretty good for a 50k. The race will be on the trails that I do all of my runs so I know the area well. I love a new challenge.

Cons:  I've never trained for or raced anything over a 10k. My main concern is injury. I have a running history completely littered with injuries. I've got tendonitis in both knees and the right has a bone spur. The left, has something else funky going on (never went to the doc for that one, but it's the one that kept me out for a year). My left Achilles has a history of insertional tendonitis that flares up occasionally (it's been behaving since I have been going the last few months). The last time I jumped to high mileage I managed to strain both my hip flexor and groin at the same time. (Had to lift my leg with my hands to get into my car or the shower haha).

So what do you think AdvancedRunning? Should I commit to the challenge of the 50k or will the longer race be a fast track back to the injured sidelines? If I enter this 50k, I won't just be training to finish, I'll be training to win.

I will be happy to provide more information as needed. Thanks for your input!",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,,True,t3_11rlcx,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/11rlcx/considering_a_50k/,

****************************************

**Background**

17 year-old Jimmy has been running for 3 years. He is 5'8"" and weighs 145. His 5k PR is an 18:00 on a relatively flat course, however he generally does better place-wise on hillier courses. Jimmy does proportionally better in spring track, as he has a 4:48 1600m and a 0:58 400m. His race times in spring track do not vary as much as they do in XC.

**edit: Weekly Mileage**
He runs 40-50 mi/week, but Jimmy is not as consistent as he would like to be. He has more weeks that are 30-40 mi/week than he would like.

**Goal**

Jimmy's ultimate goal is to see more success as a miler. How would you train him?",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,True,,,True,t3_mvrts,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/mvrts/training_thursdays_plan_that_plan/,

I wasn't sure if I wanted to compete in college but I realized I miss the sport very much and want to run on a college team so I need to look into transferring. I wasn't recruited really at all for running. I ran 15:49 for 5k in October 2011, and 9:26 for 3200m and 4:24 for 1600m as a senior in Spring of 2012 (after dealing with injuries over the winter). Qualified to states in cross country and track but never performed well there because of poor tapering in my opinion.

I continued to run the summer going into college and I ran a 16:15 5k back in November 2012. However, since then I really haven't ran. I finally started back up the first week of April. I've been at 30 miles and am trying to just get the base back. This week I am on pace to hit 40 miles and I am doing the bulk of that at 7:10 pace. For reference, going into my senior year of high school my summer consisted of 50-60 miles a week with double runs and some quality tempos.

Anyways, I don't know where I am headed running wise for now but with school winding down and summer ahead of me I am looking to get back in shape and possibly find a place to run competitively again as a college sophomore. I suppose my goals would be geared towards some road races, although I'm not sure how quickly I can return to fast performances. I think it would be awesome to run a 15:30-15:50 5k maybe 2-3 months from now but that's probably ambitious. I just know I love running and really miss my high school training and team but I want to find somewhere that I can continue to compete and really see how fast I can be. I know I never reached my potential in high school.

Sorry for the long winded post, would appreciate any advice or input from anyone regarding college running and potential schools I should look at, and also how to get back on track and perhaps how I should tailor my goals and running schedule given the info I've provided.

There was a meta thread a few days back that addressed some concerns with the sub and we came up with an idea to alleviate those concerns. 

So from now on, the first and third monday of each month will have an official ""beginner"" thread. This way any one who has beginners questions can ask them in that thread, and anyone who wants to answer them can respond. This consolidates all ""beginner"" threads  twice a month and still allows them to be answered by more ""seasoned"" runners. I put these terms in quotes because they are very loose and I do not feel it is appropriate to put time/mileage guidelines with them. 

But here are some examples of threads that are fine being posted any time. 

[Question about transferring from D1 to D1 schools.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/19vazj/any_currentformer_ncaa_runners_experience/) 

[Lopez Lomong announcement about breaking record.](http://www.flotrack.org/article/18885-Lopez-Lomong-breaks-Lagats-5000-Meter-Indoor-American-Record) 

[A breakdown of a users training data from February.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/19gc1w/monthly_data_february/)

And here are some that could have probably been lumped into the new threads I'm going to start every first/third monday. 

[Boston Qualifier Question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/19ds8c/looking_on_advice_training_for_a_bq_time/) 

[Racing advice for 800m/1600m](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/199htw/general_advice_for_800m_and_1600m/)

[Water consumption question](http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1a1vdz/how_much_water_should_i_be_drinking_throughout/)

I just ask that you use discretion, if you're not sure just ask. There are some insanely fast/educated people here with all sorts of experience and we want everyone to tap into that experience. We just want it consolidated and to avoid clutter (no offense to r/running but they have a lot of repeat questions and we're trying to avoid that from happening to us).

Next monday is the third monday and then we'll do the next one on April 1st. :)

I ran 4:24 and 9:26 my senior year in April 2012. 5k PR is also 15:42 from October 2011. I feel like I have untapped potential. Never had a fully fantastic training period - always cut short or cut back by coach's orders. I didn't train seriously after graduating, and I wasn't in good racing shape. I quit the university team I was on two weeks into the school year. I don't know why - I guess personal problems: I had/have no self confidence and am having a difficult time socially and adjusting to university even though my first year in nearly over and the second semester ends in a month and a half. I couldn't bond with the team (even though I should have because they are runners like me) because of self image issues and just not knowing how to adapt to typical university life of partying/alcohol/etc. Having a very young appearance and I feel very out of place in university setting. I know that's something I have to solve on my own and some of it I can't control but it's really held me back as a person for the last 6 months.

Over my holiday break I put in a hard load of training on my own up until New Year's Day. I was feeling great and I jumped from 45 to 60 miles in one week which I think caused injury. Should have built up gradually but I got too eager). I've been out with runner's knee and ITBS since then and really haven't done anything. It's been 10 weeks. It's gotten a lot better since, and I am starting physical therapy next week. I am working on hip strengthening because I have a constant ache in my hip and I know its causing problems. I am hoping to run at the start of April and build a nice mileage phase in so I can run some fast times in a few summer public 5k/10k races. I'm concerned how much fitness I've lost, although at this point since its been 10 weeks I've come to accept it. I've never been off running for more than 2 weeks at a time though. I'm going to build up mileage slowly of course since there's no team commitment for me right now. I am worried this extended break (12-14 weeks by April) in running has disrupted my long term growth as a runner. I know there's nothing I can do about the lost time now, but will it be a lot harder for me to return to my high school PRs? I'd like to run 15:15 in a 5k around July/August for personal satisfaction. I am going to start up a Daniel's plan but I think my goal may be too unrealistic with the long break I've had due to injury?

I'm also having a hard time figuring out what I am doing with my college running career. I cannot decide on where I'd like to transfer. I would be transferring mainly for running if I decide to do so. I am not at a strong academic school now so I wouldn't mind, but realistically I'm pretty nervous to make such a drastic move and I really need to get my self esteem and social outlook more stable so I can actually enjoy a team aspect again. I really need to adapt to university lifestyle, it's just very difficult for me for reasons I mentioned above. My high school team was small but I had a couple best friends there. Things just have fallen apart for me sadly since I graduated. Running keeps me sane and happy and I am looking forward to doing it again finally. I have always been self motivated for running so I know I can stick to a training plan. If I didn't get injured, I had a spring racing schedule of public races planned out for myself. I was very excited to run fast. At the same time, I was somewhat sad I am not running track at university as I feel that's what I really should be doing as a typical freshman. But right now I just want to find happiness. After I run these summer races, I need to figure out what I will do long term. I want to enjoy a team and be normal but I've been viewed as a loner at times. I will say though that my university teammates - for the short time I knew them - seemed to care more about alcohol than competing. I need a team more dedicated. My high school team none of us messed with drinking or whatever, we just liked running and hanging out at a movie. I know university life is different and more mature/adventurous than that and maybe that's my problem that I can't adjust to that. I am excited for the next few months run fast again. I am going to talk to my high school coach soon for advice. However I would truly appreciate any redditors willing to chime in on all I have written :)

SPARKNOTES: 4:24/9:26 high school PRs from a year ago. Haven't ran since beginning of January due to injuries. Haven't cross trained either because that aggravates injury. Strengthening and starting physical therapy soon. Hoping to run April 1st and build up mileage again. I'd like to post up 15:15 5k, maybe too ambitious after no running for 3 months?

I know it sounds silly, but i have really huge calves/big legs (but i am still skinny) and i cannot do this. EVER. They prevent me for my legs to go that high up, b/c my calves are so big and the extra fat i have on my hamstrings, they collide and i cannot kick that high up.

I also have been told that i have really long legs (i am 6ft) but some of the shortest strides my coaches have ever seen, is this why?

I am talking specifically about weight training. I do a good bit of body weight stuff before and after workouts (pull-ups, push-ups, swiss ball core stuff, etc.) but I want to get more serious about creating a weight program for myself.

I am looking to get in the gym about once a week, and of course I am not interested in bulking up or gaining weight. I am looking at this as a way to help counter some of the imbalances I have in my body that I think have caused some injuries in the past. I am thinking specifically of the relationship between my quads (strong) and hamstrings (weak) and my core (strong) and lower back (weak).

I have read a bunch of different material regarding this issue and I have come to understand that low rep/high weight sets would be best at accomplishing my goals. Do you have any thoughts on this?

Some of the exercises I am considering here include:

- Deadlift
- Half-squats
- Lunges (with dumbbells)
- Dumbbell One-Arm Lat Rows
- Alternate Standing Shoulder Press


Do you all have any suggestions/thoughts/critiques on my approach here. 

Lastly, my first race of the season (Ekiden) is next week. Would it be a bad idea to start this strength work right before the season starts even though the big races aren't until next month. If so, should I hold off completely on it until the spring or would shorter reps/lower weights still allow me to get some benefits without wearing my body down?

In case it matters, I have been running for about 2 years (24 y.o.), 45-50 mpw, not very fast (recent times: 18:00 - 5km/ 4:40 - 1600m). 

Thanks.

I am in the middle of California's track season, and I raced this past Saturday, PR'ing with a 4:50 1600m. My splits went 68-73-74-73, with some change, equating to a 4:50.44/72.61. The race went well, but now I need to re-focus my energies on making the next jump downwards in my times. Training has been going well, and my coach and I both feel like I'm primed to make some solid improvements in the next five weeks. But first, some background information:

I'm a high school sophomore, age 16, with a PR's of: 2:12, 4:50, 10:45, 17:40 (XC). Averaging 35-45 miles per week, with a usual weekly schedule looking like this:

* Monday-Long recovery run (9-10m) @ 6:45 pace
* Tuesday-Medium run (6-7m) @ 7:00-7:20
* Wednesday-Workout, for example: 3x(500-300-200), with 500's @ 73/lap, 300 @ 52, 200 @ 34 (went faster though, just targets) +(2x150).
* Thursday-Medium run (6-7m) @ 7:00-7:20
* Friday-Pre-race 4-5m @ 7:30-7:45
* Saturday-Race, 2-3m warmup, Race (1600m or 3200m generally), 2-3m cool down
* Sunday-Off
* (Sample Mileage=39 miles)

This is generally what a week with a race looks like, and if we don't have a race, we have another w/o's on Tuesday/Thursday, and long run Saturday. We also lift two times a week, and stretch and foam roll everyday.

My goals for the season are to break the F/S School Record in 1600m (3200m also, but less likely): 4:48.7 and 10:33. I haven't run a hard 3200m this season, but will be this Saturday. I started season off with 4:55, then went 4:52, 4:56(hot, tired, etc), and now 4:50. Work-outs have been going well. For example, here are two recent w/o's I completed:

* 91 sec || 500 m ||
* 51 sec || 300 m || 
* 31 sec || 200 m || 
* 93 sec || 500 m || 
* 52 sec || 300 m || 
* 32 sec || 200 m || 
* 88 sec || 500 m || 
* 50 sec || 300 m || 
* 30 sec || 200 m || 
* 22 sec || 150 m || 
* 21 sec || 150 m ||
 
 and 

* 0:03:23 || 1000 m || 5:26 Pace
* 0:03:26 || 1000 m || 5:31 Pace
* 0:03:21 || 1000 m || 5:23 Pace

My question for AR is this: What am I doing right, what am I doing wrong, and overall, what can I do too improve my mile time? Any workout's you guys really like to test/improve fitness? Any tips or suggestions for thing to incorporate.

If you have more questions for me about my training to improve your answer, please let me know. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to respond!

Thanks!

I would have to run this time in early September to get on, and I believe that it is done on a track. This is approximately a 3:12/km pace. 

People that I've talked to have told me that this would be impossible for me to attain so soon after starting to run, but I was still interested in giving it my best. I am 18 and have started running seriously 2 years ago and in the past 12 weeks I've put in some of my most serious training yet for a half-marathon that is in two weeks. I've run up to 140km per week during this time with an average at 110km. My PB's (although I think I could do way better) are 16:35 for the 5k, 36:17 for the 10k and 1:27 for the Half-Marathon. I can run the 400m in under 60 seconds. I am 6""0 and weight 74kg.

What do you guys think? Can I put in some serious work from now until September and see some significant improvement? Is is a reasonable goal for me?

I also lifted light (lots of reps) and heavy (low reps) just about every week.

**Here was my last thread:** http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/14krcw/reporting_in_for_a_update_on_myself_danxorhs/ can follow back to the rest of them as well

**Training:**
I feel a lot faster, but I did a timed mile..and got 5:50ish?... (i was still sore from a lots of reps workout 3days prior but I don't think it would affect me that much)

I even bought 3 running books for the mental side of running/racing better and just..5:50 I couldn't believe it, but the books helped me cope with it and just deal with it/move on.

But..heres the interesting part..: So 3rd day of track, my coach has me train with the other main coach as a sprinter, and I am doing very well probably 3rd fastest guy right now perhaps. And I love it, it isn't crazy workouts to the absolute point of exhaustion, it is tireing and hard..but the main coach def. knows what hes doing

**Times for other events:**
Oh I also ran a 800m (the event i am aiming for) and ended up making a stupid mistake and ran the 1st lap at about 1:00 (first 200m was probably around 26s) so I faded away to 2:24 (proper pacing I KNOW i can hit 2:10 right now)

5th day(fri): I ran a race 400m to determine where everyone is right now in sprinting, and I came in 3rd with a 56s (1-2s PR for me with no speed training at all really, just 1 day if you can't even call what we did speed training..been working on form) And my main coach believes with all the endurance stuff I did over the break, and past year even if my mile/2mile times weren't even that ""good"" this is what it was working for, the 800m endurance.

**Overall:**
Main coach who has coached state caliber athletes has put me into sprinters to up my speed to make the 800m ""easier"" and he really knows what he is doing, I don't feel like complete shit every practice. All the xc stuff and distance running was just to build endurance

**Questions:**
What do you guys think of all of this? Great change for me? I am naturally pretty fast I know I can run a 200m in about 23-24 (not sure about 22s)

Running the 400m and 800m on your toes a good thing? I have noticed in the 800m I can run on my toes until about..500m then I start to fade away from my toe running and my calves give out (and I have very strong calves) how should I run it?

1355795760.0,9,self.AdvancedRunning,1510de,Injury &amp; Frustration: Any hope of getting back to competitive running?,Croixrousse,11,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1510de/injury_frustration_any_hope_of_getting_back_to/,"I used to be fairly good: Junior year of high school I was 2nd place at my state cross-country meet, and won the state 2-mile (ran just under 9:20 that season, it's a small state.)

Senior year things went downhill. The summer before that year, I told myself I was going to train my ass off and go to Foot Lockers, then run sub-9:00 outdoors. So I ran 90-100 miles a week that summer (after doing 60-75 most of junior year.) I came into cross-country season fit but already tired, crushed a few early-season meets, then succumbed to overtraining, finally calling it a season two weeks before the state meet when I realized I had tibial stress fractures as well. The rest of senior year was several attempts to get back to training only to get hurt again from progressing too fast.

I went to a D1 college with a good running program, and spent freshman year gradually getting used to running ~70 mpw again (no racing). Second year I overtrained myself when it mattered and didn't get to race except for a few road races when home on vacation (struggled with anemia, but no big injuries.) Third year, at last, I put together a full cross-country season - nothing impressive, ending up ~60th place at Regionals, but it was a joy to be competing in some fashion again! This was the first time since high school that I'd raced in a team uniform of any kind.

Then immediately after the end of the season I came down with bad knee tendinitis (it had been bugging me on and off for much of the past year but got worse at this point.) So I spent the early part of 2012 very slowly getting back into shape again. I just managed to break 15:00 in my one track race at the beginning of the summer. Summer training went alright until mid- July when the knee problems came back in full force. At this point I quit the team, as things seemed pretty hopeless and I was looking likely to be asked to leave if I didn't go first. 

At the beginning of this, my last school year, I managed to get very slightly back into shape, had a month of running 70+ miles/week, raced one decent road 5K, then promptly got hurt again, mainly with the same old knee tendinitis (at least, I think it's tendinitis; pain that comes on during the run in the bony area where the patellar tendon inserts into the tibia, and is particularly noticeable when doing a deep knee bend.) Since mid-November I have not had a week over 40 miles, and it hasn't been an upward trajectory, either. 

At this point I am severely frustrated and dead tired of (metaphorically speaking) banging my head against a brick wall. I have had a grand total of one injury-free season of racing since junior year of high school, and only two track races during that period of time. Every time I claw myself back into shape, something else goes wrong- and I've now had these knee problems on and off for almost two years. Looking back over my running logs, it seems like almost every run has a comment along the lines of ""this was sore"" or ""that was hurting for the last 3 miles"" or some such. 

At the worst moments I do contemplate giving up, or at least taking a very long break, but as soon as I have one pretty good training run (let alone a race), I remember how much I love this sport and how essential it has been to my happiness and my idea of myself as a person since about the 8th grade. The rare intervals of smooth healthy running between injuries are absolutely delightful, and I don't know what I'd do with myself in the absence of competitive running. I do NOT want to admit what my body seems to be telling me, which is that I will never get back to the glory days of mostly injury-free running, and regular competitive racing at a level that reflects my abilities; that high school will have been the pinnacle of my running career.  

Is there any hope of beating these injuries, putting my training on a solid foundation, and really doing running properly again, setting PRs, and all that? Or am I deluding myself by keeping at this?

* 3 mile fun run time trial: 21:26 (October 2012)
* 5k: 24:05 (June 2012)
* 10k: 48:34 - (Hilly -- 750ft elevation gain/loss and into the wind, no taper, October 2012)
* half marathon: 1:45:35 (September 2012)

I'm currently training for a marathon in hopes of going sub 3:45 doing Pftizinger's 12/55 plan. This goal came from a recent half marathon time of 1:45:35 and McMillian's equivalent training race calculator suggesting a 3:42 marathon. Since I have no idea what I'm doing, I tacked on a few minutes for good measure.

As you can see from my training log, I've been pretty consistent all year only taking two weeks off. I've increased my mileage from ~25 mpw to where I am now -- easily able to maintain ~45-50 mpw. 

I don't really know where this goal came from, but I thought it would be cool to get down below 90 minutes. My goal half would probably be at the end of 2013. My question for you guys is what should my training look like next year after the marathon? How much quality work should I be doing? How many half marathons should I plan on racing before my ""goal"" race next year? What sort of improvement should be attempting to get between each of these races?

Hopefully you guys can help focus my training for next year to help me achieve my goal.

I almost immediately get a stitch/cramp to the side of my stomach. I try to take on small amounts but just can't get it right. I've read that our stomachs shutdown further the longer you run so I believe that taking on fluids earlier rather than later will help. This seems to stand up considering a recent run where I drank a little too much on the 19th mile of my 22mile long run and my stomach ached almost immediately. Is it that my stomach has shut down or is it that I'm so drained from limited liquids that it hurts me?

I've ran 3x 20miles over really tough hills and more often than not, i've had 1x gel and a swig of sports drink. I know, at the pace i'll be running in Berlin I'll blow up, likely before the final 6 miles.

I'm 5' 9"" and weigh 9st 3lbs if this is useful. After a 20mile run taking on barely any liquids had lost about 2-3lbs. I'm on track to run 3:30:00 based on my 1:37 half the other week and how well I ran on my 3x 20mile runs into the very hilly moors.

I could do with some advice and tactics on how to handle this even though I've no more time to practice.  Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,1348176800.0,,,True,t3_107k9j,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/107k9j/difficulty_drinking_fluids_during_marathon_1_week/,

I began with like a 26-minute 5k and brought it down to high 21's, then over indoor and outdoor track progressed from a high-12 2 mile to 11:42. Over the summer I ran more mileage -- nothing really high, but about 35-40 a week interspersed with local races, hills, and 800 repeats, and I took a day off each week. I came into cross country greatly improved, starting with 18:35 and ending with a 17:09, though my PR was on a course that was fast and possibly too short (my previous PR from 2 weeks earlier was 17:47) -- probably worth like 17:30 on a normal flat course. During indoor track this year I went from a 10:38 to a 10:21. We generally ran low mileage and track workouts throughout the season, so I was forced to run a lot over the weekend to keep up a decent weekly total (35-45 usually). I had a very disappointing outdoor season and my best time was a 10:30, though around mid-season I was even worse with a 10:40-10:50 2 mile and a mile time of 5:03 (my PR is 4:54). I felt like I was missing something mentally and I no longer got nervous or excited for races, which in hindsight was probably mental burnout. Several people I beat during indoor who ran in the high 10's destroyed me during outdoor with times of 10:10-10:20.


So I basically have 2 questions. First of all, what should I be doing over the summer? I've tried some higher mileage this year especially during the break between indoor and outdoor track (55-65 mpw) although I've never done high mileage very consistently. I've read about the [Summer of Malmo](http://pih.bc.ca/summerofmalmo.html) and think it sounds like a good, albeit ambiguous, plan. I was thinking about hitting maybe 60-70 mpw with 4 doubles a week and substituting hill workouts for some of the tempo or speed workouts outlined in the Summer of Malmo, since I've never done well with hills and the regional cross country meet is on a very hilly course. So here might be a sample week:

* Monday -- AM: 3-4, PM: 4 tempo
* Tuesday -- AM: 3-4, PM: 8
* Wednesday -- 10
* Thursday -- AM: 3-4, PM: hill repeats (4 miles or so)
* Friday -- AM: 3-4, PM: 8
* Saturday -- 13
* Sunday -- 6

However I'm not sure whether it would be better to do more mileage in singles or doubles, as I've seen a lot of different opinions online. And as for my mental burnout, I don't really know how to get over it except maybe not to do workouts for a couple weeks. So:

* How do I get over burnout (if that is what I'm experiencing)?
* Does 60-70 mpw sound like a reasonable amount of mileage over the summer?
* Is it a good idea to double, and if so, how much mileage should be in doubles?

My second question: what can I do to prevent something like this from happening in the future? I feel like the problem may have been with my training during indoor track, so if it is, what can I do about it? I've been thinking that maybe I should try to run in the mornings in the winter and try not to do too many hard workouts in an attempt to build some sort of a base for outdoor track. Next year I'd really like to hit my goals of 16:40 in cross country and 10:00 in the 2 mile, so I'm hoping that I can get in good shape and start to see some improvement again. Thanks for your advice.

He started the XC season as number 2 varsity (quite slower than number 1, but he was only a first year guy). This was before any races, on 5 mile runs he would come back right after our fast guy, and likewise, in repeats he would finish with the rest of the fast guys (He said he ran 600 miles over the summer and got a strong aerobic base). Less than a week into our training, though, he started getting beaten by some guys who he had beaten the day before. By our first race he was the #10 on the team, and by the last he was #17. At first, I was sure he overtrained, as he still went hard on the ""easy"" days, but after putting in 600 miles between XC and track he was still slower than the guys who he had been capable of beating months before and moved farther down in the ranking.

This kid is the nicest guy in the world, a great team player, and he tries just as hard as the rest of varsity. I've been watching him for some time now and seriously can't figure out what his problem is. He talked to me last week about this and I hate not being able to give him a straight answer.

Coaches, have you ever had runners fade like crazy like this? Why did it happen? Thanks.

Edit: The kid has a hematocrit level of 39 where the normal range is 36-50. Its borderline to anemia, does this number vary for runners?

I injured my heel, it happened really suddenly on an 8 miler back in early January. Took 5 weeks off (was still doing lots of working out at the gym to stay fit) and recently with stretching, strengthening, and some ice water i've felt comfortable enough giving running a go again. So 2.1M pain free this morning felt great (although the achilles tendon is very tight right now lol!)

Seriously, every damn jogger in the universe is wearing vibram five fingers or some other minimalist. I've been a runner for years, I train in racing flats (albeit heavy ones coming in at the high 6.x oz mark), and I STILL managed to injure my heel. This people are stupid and I want to slap almost every one of them.

Hopefully my leg comes back strong so I can get back into the thick of training, i've lost valuable time on achieving my goal for the AF Marathon this September. 

Also, what does everyone think of the new side bar picture? Side note, justarunner won that race. ;) (time need not be mentioned, rather slow. Funny story though. I was in a close race with my county rival. As the race progressed I kept extending the lead a couple meters at a time. Just before the 2 mile mark I took a wrong turn, for I was in the fucking zone, my friend yelled back to me and was all, ""JUSTARUNNER, YOU TOOK A WRONG TURN!"" I turn around, and sure enough, bro is now a solid 50-70 meters in front of me. I hauled ass to track him back down. Immediately passed him right back. Reopened lead, won race by like 50 meters. Next day, whole cover of local sports page, ""Rutherford runner veers off course, rallies to win race"" picture of goofy me in white oakleys with a bald dome structure looking awkward running.

So I run club XC at my school, but I've had a larger overarching goal: maintain quality mileage. That is the major plotline, akin to Frodo going to Mordor in terms of difficulty for me.

**A tWiSt In ThE sToRy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**

I am in Naval ROTC, which means they give us a sprint workout on Mondays and Tuesdays at 5:50AM. They're not particularly hard, but they're enough. But then there's the club team's track workout on Tuesdays nights at 8:00PM. The tuesday night workouts are my highest quality workout of the week. They generally total about 10 miles including warmups and cooldowns.

So right there that's three workouts in a row, two of them within 6 hours of each other. And generally, because I've been aiming for mileage, I'd go run later in the day on Wednesday, bringing me to 20 miles in 24 hours with a good deal of those miles being run at race pace. Throw in a long run on Sunday, and that's 4 workouts in a row. Race on Saturday? Make it 5.

I had/have been trying to practice pushing off with my toes a little bit more which resulted in tendonitis. This was really a combination of both curling my toes when I pushed off and broken orthotics. Fixing the curling and fixing the orthotics has made the issue go away, though. So starting in early September, I was doing this setup pretty successfully. There would be occasionally a week or so when I couldn't run and so I would cycle or aquajog, but then I'd be back at 50 mi/week and feel great about it. FINALLY, my ankle started getting it's act together and I was able to get in not one, not two, but THREE 50 mile weeks in a row, including the whole 4 consecutive workouts/week thing. I was feeling great and I ran a PR 5k at the beginning of it all, and finished it up with a very tiring 8k performance. Now that the 8k is behind me, I tried my hand at doing another 50 mile week... but alas, my body is fried.

My legs have been dead and just lacking speed. I can't seem to round up any pace faster than 7:00/mi. I'm experiencing a good deal of tightness and soreness in my lower calves (below the bulge), it that matters.

tl;dr: not sure if i overtrained or just peaked too early, but i'm borked now

One problem was they didn't have any food on the course. I think this was the main cause of my downfall, especially since my breathing was fine the whole race. 

So I decided to continue training for another 6 weeks and signed up for a marathon the beginning of December as a sort of re-do. I took 3 days off after the race, then did easy running the rest of the week. Now I'm back at it, doing tempo running and long runs and feeling pretty great so I have high hopes for December.

Run on the trail system of a state park in the northern Georgia mountains (similar terrain to the GA Appalachian Trail, though the park is west of the AT).

Live in the foothills. Have a wife and young baby that prevents me from driving 1.5 hours (one way) to the AT (or similar big mountains) every weekend. My town and surrounding terrain is hilly and rugged, but I just don't have that vert I need.

I emphasize hill running on all my training runs. Luckily, I have access to a trail system 5 minutes (running) from my front door. I run trails 90% of my weekly mileage. I do hill repeats and try to run fast when I can.

Recently, after 4 days of good running in big mountains (NC and GA), I realized that sprinting and hill running share some common pain. I figure running as fast as possible up my smalls hills may compensate SOME for the lack of vert in my training.

So, how do I train to be competitive in big mountains? Oxygen at elevation is obviously not an issue in the south, but the steepness and length of climbs can be dramatic. I was put in my place on a 7.2 mile run at Black Rock Mountain State Park. It was the first time my mind wanted to run up the mountain, but my (well-trained and fit) body simply couldn't muster more than a power hike.

TLDR: Live in the foothills and racing in the moutains. How can I most effectively train in the ""piedmont""?

And.....I know the answer is ""I really can't."" But I am going to try!

EDIT: Don't want to blame my inability drive far on anyone but me. I would just feel too guilty being gone for HOURS every weekend when I know my wife would like to be out running too. We are going to work on a ""babywatching while each other run"" situation so we can both drive up to the mountains on weekends.  I am more interested in learning how to maximize my weekday runs and runs where I don't make it to the biggins.

1. Both 5K and 10K starting at the same time

2. an 8m wide start line

3. about 30 kids under 10 all crowding the start line

4. No idea about how to tell people to let the faster folks go up front

I had lined myself up to run with the 6 minute milers but of course the kids figured they could crowd into the space for the 5 min runners.

Crap.  You know exactly what happened.

The start gun goes off, the kids sprint out for about 100m then get tired.  Then they start walking, turning around, looking for their friends, and actually going backwards.

So my first three or four minutes was dodging these kids.  To be fair, I was not close to a PR and won my age group anyway, but it would have been nice to break 20 minutes.

Crap.

I'm in a constant state of worrying that I'm over-consuming, but I don't want to under-consume either and end up being sluggish on runs.  Does anyone have tips for how they calculate their caloric intake?

Details:

I get into situations where I'm not sure if I'm hungry (esp. if I'm bored at work).  This usually leads to drinking more water, just to be sure that I'm not simply thirsty.  This doesn't always do anything within 20 mins or so, which leads me to believe that I actually was hungry and to eat some food (I have a solid supply of healthy food in good protein/carb mix: dried fruit, nuts, banana, apple, peanut butter, etc.).  Even when I'm cranking out 50-60 mile weeks and I feel like my diet is solid and balanced, my weight isn't where I'd like it to be (maybe 5-7 lbs too high, I'm at 9-10% body fat, I think).

Coming into this meet I was ranked about 8th with my time from the weekend before (1:55.7x) so I had a great chance of making finals.

The format for making finals was top two of each heat and next two fastest. I was a little worried about getting in to the top two as there was two guys with faster seed times than me, one was a 1:54 and another 1:53 plus the indoor conference champ was in my heat and had only run slightly slower than myself. 

The weather for prelims were just about perfect. Little wind, and warm temperatures. The race went out pretty normally, I was at about :27 at the 200m and :57 at 400m and feeling alright. I was in 4th place (I think?) at this time, but had a little gap to make up. My kick has been great the last couple of weeks, but I just hadn't felt great. With 200m to go though I had closed the gap on the third place runner as him and the now 2nd place runner were starting to hurt and I was surging. I got into 2nd place with about 75m to go and held on without having to kick too hard, so onto finals. It was a good thing I got 2nd in the heat because a 3rd place would have left me out of the finals.

The next day was finals, and it was a windy and a bit chilly day. Perfect because that meant a tactical race with a big kick. Exactly how I run. The race went out how I would've liked, but I didn't put myself in the right position on the track for proper mobility as I went into lane 1 after the break to get out from the wind. We were at 200m in about :28 or :29 and slowed down to :60 for the first half of the race. I was sitting in last place, but feeling ready to go. Unfortunately, the guy to my outside surged as well and I go trapped into this position, so I was still in 8th with 300m, but not too far behind the leader. Tried surging again but same situation happened, so with 200m to go I was still in last. The top 4 finishers started their kick now and I was stuck in last. It wasn't until about 100m left to where I was able to kick, but the top 4 opened up about a 5m gap on the guy in 5th. In that last 100m I was able to close on everyone, but the top 4, as they finished about 5-10m ahead of me. Winner ran a low 1:56 (was a teammate) and I ran a 1:57.3x, so I finished in a somewhat disappointing 5th. 

Had I been in 3rd or 4th with 200m to go, would I have been able to win? Possibly, but I didn't put myself in the right position, so we will never know. I definitely learned my lesson to keep myself in a position on the track to move around in the race and easily move up.

Looking back on the season though, I had a good one. I was injured throughout indoor so I didn't race until outdoor where I opened up with a 2:07 (I got tripped up and feel with 100m to go, maybe would've ran a 2:01). It really wasn't until these last two weeks where I ran well as I ran a PR of 1:56.5x two Tuesdays ago and got my first collegiate win. Later in the week I ran 1:55.7x for another win, so I am pleased with my season and learned a lot about my own training and racing.

I just got back from a race were I placed 19th out of 30 with a 9:28. I was in contention for the top ten with 4 laps to go. Along with a possible sub 9:20, but as laps 6 and 7 came by I started to get passed liked crazy. This unfortunately seems to be a trend in my races. Today I went 74 and 75 for laps 6 and 7. I know I can do so much better because I was able to close in a 65, and a 31 for my last 200. 

Does anyone have some tips or suggestions on how to tackle this problem? 

**Race Recap:**
I got to the track at around 6:40 and my race was scheduled for 8:20. The meet was perfectly run and right on time, practically down to the last second. I began my warm up at 7:25(ish). I went out and and did a relaxed jog for around 5 minutes, then slowly picked up the pace til I was just at 7:20-7:30 mile pace. I got back to the registration tent at 7:50 and got checked in. Then I met up with nick, a friend of mine, and we went back out for another 8 minute jog. 

He decided to go for a bit longer, but I wanted to head back in to start to do more stretching. I took off my ski hat (It's a weird tradition at my school, all the distance runners have team ski hats) and gloves. I did AIS, plyometric stretching, and a few strides then it was time to head to the line. The girls 3200 had just finished (awesome side note: the girl that won lead the race from the first step and did a 9:57, 2nd place was a 10:36. But as she cross the finish line her boy friend had this huge banner that read ""PROM?"" and so that was pretty cool) and everyone moved to their positions on the waterfall.

 I forget what it's called when there is a 2nd, smaller, waterfall placed in front of the first and the athletes in the 2nd water fall have to stay in the outside 4 lanes until the end of the 1st turn (Anyone know what I'm talking about or am I just crazy? Don't answer that), but we had that start and I was positioned in the middle of the 2nd water fall.

The gun went off and I had a great start, I had the inside of lane 4 and was approaching the apex of the first turn when I heard the gun go off again; signaling a fallen runner or a false start. No biggie, it's a good way to stretch out the legs one last time and we all head back to the line again. The gun goes off again, I don't have as a great start as last time. However it's still a good start and our group merges well with the main group at the end of the first turn. 

We continue down the back stretch and I find myself in roughly 20th place. The second turn approaches and I managed to find the inside of lane number two, not the best, but it beats being that guy out in lane 4. The pack is still tight as we go through the first lap in 67, right now the total time from 1st to 30th was around 5 seconds so everyone is in a tight group.

You really forget how physical the 3200 gets, especially with a 30 man race where everyone gone sub 9:50. There is some slight elbowing but nothing overly aggressive, just people trying to get a place in the inside lane. Another friend of mine almost trips on the person in front of him and I catch his back and steady him. He gave me a thumbs up right as I started to think ""wow I know this is only lap 2, but I feel really good. I could win this"", however as we complete the second lap I hear a coach scream ""what the fuck was that?!?!?!? a 74? On lap 2? You have to be shitting me"" The entire pack probably thought in their heads those words verbatim. The pace slowly starts to speed up and I decide to move up from my 23rd or so place spot.

Right at the end of the 2nd turn I find the outside lane and move around the tightly huddle pack in front of me. The announcer reports my move and says my name, I grin to myself a little. At the beginning of the first turn of lap 3 I merge in nicely and I'm positioned around 8th place. The pack is still tight and the time between 1st to 30th is around 7 seconds. Almost on cue, the second I settle in the pace picks back up and I go through the 3rd lap in a 69. 

Two guys pass me as we reach the halfway point. A 4:42 is my 1600 split, making our quarters 67, 74, 69, 72. Not exactly the most optimal thing, but you have to make do. After some slight jostling for position we go through in another 72. This is where things start to get bad for me. I start to feel the pace speed up and the gap between me and the person in front starts to widen. People start to pace me at a slow and steady rate.

The only way I can describe it is like I stopped racing and was just running. I go through lap 5 in a 74, it gets even worst the next lap and I go through in a 75. I finally snap out of it and start to begin to race again. I began the last lap in 25th place. In anger I began to speed up like crazy. I manage to pass two people by the 200m to go point. I told myself fuck it and passed a group of 3 in lane 3. This ended up helping me more than it hurt because I needed to get to the outside lanes of the track in order to pass next guy because he was on the right wing of a small group of people. 

I pass one last guy with about 50m left to go and would of caught the rest of the 5 man group if the race had been for 3250m, but it wasn't so I take 19th with a 9:28. It's a 5 second PR but it feels bitter sweet. I was one of the favorites for breaking the 9:20 barrier. I also wanted to wow some of the D1 coaches there, but all the attention are on the ones that broke 9:20. My friend who I warmed up with had a 30 second PR and came in second with 9:10. The one who I helped stabilize got a new PR of 9:13 and a 7th place finish. It's funny because when I ran my 9:33 I was ecstatic that I had placed 3rd at the indoor state championship and qualified for nationals, but now I just feel hollow I had a chance to be with my two friends in that magic sub 9:20 range. But instead I missed qualifying for New Balance Outdoor Nationals by 3 seconds, but I know that this is just the beginning of the season and that I'll have more chances down the road. Still It would have been nice to do it in my first real race of the season. 

Oh well, I'll still take the PR and I helped improve my school record, so I take today as a learning experience on how to go out about large high caliber meets.

Back to my question though, now that you semi re lived the race, do you have any tips, workouts, ideas, suggestions, or anything that might help my problem with laps 6 and 7?

Anyway thanks for reading this far, and I hope you enjoyed my recap.

Any advice?,korbonix,9,0,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/sz0j0/slow_marathon_compared_to_half_and_5k_any_advice/,"I've run 3 marathons and hand full of 5Ks and one half marathon. I take the full marathons more seriously.

Anyway, I hurt myself last Jan (2011) and was off running till late May. I didn't want to hurt myself so I took it really easy. Here's my schedule from early June (2011) till the Houston marathon (Jan 9 2012):

[Training Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AgZd4zmuAXmidGNMOWp1TzZLREI4NUl1SElCck45T2c)

(**Note**: a row with a date has what I was supposed to do for that week. The next row has any deviations, or notes on how I feel. If there is nothing under the entry assume I did exactly what it said.)

Basically I ran a 5K in early May and plugged my time into RW's smart coach (I was scared of hurting myself) and stuck religiously to the plan. I stuck with that plan for a few months then ran 10K on the track and used that time or my official marathon training plan, again on RW SmartCoach. On both of these plans, Sunday is a long day and Thursday alternates between speed work (usually 4x1600) and tempo run (usually 5-9 miles). After the 10K, RW had me up my easy pace to 8min/mile. Then on Thanksgiving (Nov 24) I ran a 5K. I had no idea how fast to go, as I rarely run shorter races. I ended up with 18:26. This is very fast for me, before this my fastest was 20:20. I again upped my speed.

[Websites](http://www.runbayou.com/jackd.htm) will say that an 18:26 signifies a 2:58:high marathon, so I figured I could be good for a 3:05 with even pacing. I got up to 49 miles for my longest week in training. I ran Houston on Jan 9. I did the first 18-20 miles with near perfect pacing for a 3:05 then crashed hard and came in at 3:17:xx. Still a PR, but I feel I should've been able to do better judging from my 5K and later half marathon.

I slacked on my running, but stayed around 36mpw. A few weeks later I ran the Austin half marathon. I was very nervous, as this was my first real half marathon (I'd done the distance in training many times, of course) and the fastest I'd ever run the distance was in 1:32:31 (first half of Houston), and I'd been *slacking* for the last month. I ended up with 1:27:47 and I felt like I could've easily knocked it down to a 1:26:xx if I hadn't had beginner's fear. I honestly was a little terrified when I realized that I'd done the middle 6-8 miles or so at about a 6:33 pace. On a flat course I think I could have at least gotten down to low 1:25.

A couple weeks later I ran a 5k (slacking more than before my half marathon) and came in at 18:36. Not as good as my 18:26, but this one was basically uphill for the first half, so I figure it was a harder effort.

Anyway, I want to get my marathon time down, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Any ideas? I'm willing to answer any questions you may have that I haven't answered.

I don't do gels or GUs (lazy, I tried a couple times, but forgot to buy more). I'm willing to try. I've been told this is my problem. I've also been told I run my non-tempo, non-speed days too slow. If anyone has any insights I'm all ears and am very thankful. I'm gonna try again for &lt; 3:05 at Houston in January.

**Timeframe**:

Pacing written in minutes/mile where it is ambiguous. My speed day alternates between speedwork and tempo runs.

**June-Oct**:

Easy: ~ 8:30-8:17

Tempo: 5m @ ~ 7:05

Speedwork: 3x1600 @ 6:20-6:30

MPW: 24-36

Late September: 10K track in 41:42


**Oct-Thanksgiving**:

Easy: 8:07-8:14

Tempo: 5 miles @ 6:52-6:59

Speedwork: 4x1600 @ ~6:25

MPW: 34-49

Thanksgiving (Nov 24): 5K in 18:26


**Nov 24-Jan**:

Easy: ~7:45-8:00

Tempo: 5-9 miles @ 6:20-7

Speedwork: 4x1600 @ 5:56-6:00

MPW: 34-49

Jan 9: Marathon 3:17:xx


Very little real training...

Feb: Half Marathon 1:27:47

Still slacking...

March: 5K 18:36

5K = 18:26

""How is it possible you're doing that?"" my wife asked. I was carrying one daughter held close to my chest while the other clung to my shoulders up the stairs. It had been less than 24 hours after the Boston marathon and my body ached. It didn't matter because I just wanted to feel close to my family. It was great to be home after such an emotional few days. I finally made it to the top. 

Sitting in the Athlete Village for the Boston marathon awaiting the start, I'm shivering and looking up at ceiling of a large tent. It was 7:30 in the morning and I just wanted to sleep. It was the calmest I had ever been before a marathon because my expectations were so low. Training for this marathon was less than ideal and I had managed to only complete one 20 mile long run and a 14 mile run. But I was here for one reason - to celebrate my 40th birthday by completing the most storied road race in the world. 

Fast forward a few hours and all of my running friends are huddled together for a picture at the starting line area. A great photograph that is back-dropped by a line of port-a-potties. How fitting. We all slap hands and move into our perspective starting corrals. Nervous with anticipation, Kai and Justin pull up behind me and we were off. I wished them all luck and the crowd surged forward with hands waving in the air at the NBC camera floating overhead. There was an excitement in the air that you just cannot put into words.   

Miles 1 - 26.2

I could recap every mile in great detail but the honest truth is that I ran it for me and me only. Honestly, it felt like the first time I ran a marathon - I just wanted to finish. I surprised myself. I ripped off a 3:13 marathon with very little training. Why? I don't know. I just did what I'm used to doing.
 
After the marathon, we all congregated at MJ O'connors less then two blocks away as the bombs went off. I drank a few beers and celebrated as families lives were changed forever. But, that’s not what this recap is about. It's about emotion. It's about climbing to the top of the steps even everything is weighed against you. 

The steps the city of Boston will have to take will hurt more than the last. But in the end - they, too, will make it to the top. ",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,,True,t3_1czc1e,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1czc1e/2013_boston_marathon_recap/,

Therefore I ask, would we like to donate individually and donate now or wait until it's official and setup and donate collectively as a subreddit and as a group of runners? Once the organization is fully setup and is running as a 501(c)(3) we could donate safely through crowdtilt if we wanted to make a group donation. 

I'm open to ideas. I've pledged to donate $262 and really hope many of y'all will step up and donate, if only a few dollars.

The 22. June I will be running my first half marathon roughly 12 months after I started running, and I’m hoping someone can confirm that I’m on the (or point me to the) right track since i’m still a running noob.  
.  
**Primary goal**: Half Marathon Jun 22  
No time set yet, but want to run it as fast as possible.

**Secondary goal**: Be fit for completing a marathon Sep 7
.  
.  
**Background**

I have not been training anything since '99 when I was in the military. At the time I was able to run a sub-11 3km only on soccer/football practice.

Fast forward to 2012: with very little training (mostly hiking and bicycling to work for 2 months) my best results the *first month* were:

* Cooper: 2.58km
* 5k @ 24.42
* 10k @ 55:47
* HM @ 1:59 (training run, couldn’t walk for a week)

I was able to run ~35k per week (20 mpw) out of the box. My first race was after 2 months and 255km of training: 

8km @ 35:50, with a 5k split of 23:00.

Since then I’ve run 800km and am now almost at 65km per week (40 mpw); This running has mostly been slow so the times I’ve set since have not been all out:

* 1km @ 3:51 as fifth interval  
* 10km @ 48:58 with first half steady and second as tempo  
* HM @ 1:59 (Mostly aerobic except for last 3km)  

Over the last 6 months my VDOT according to Jack Daniel’s tables has barely changed, and has been idling at 42. However my 10k times are now much more in line with 1k/3k/5k, and I feel much stronger. Unfortunately I haven’t got a clue where I will be in 6 months, but hopefully it’ll not suck.  
.  
**The plan**  

I hope to follow Jack Daniel’s Marathon Training Plan A (got the book! but have been jumping back and forth), with a peak mileage of 40 mpw (65km). There are a few local runs which I hope to incorporate as a speed workout:

* April 18: 4km XC
* May 14: 10km (Priority)
* May 23: 3km XC
* May 30: 4km XC
* June 13: 6km XC (May consider skipping)

For those unfamiliar with it, Jack Daniels plan A is an 18 week plan with a 6 week easy prequel (which I will shorten down to 2 weeks since its only 20 weeks until the race). There is 2 quality workouts per week, with a mixture of intervals, long slow run, long steady run and tempo. The rest of the week one does easy runs to get to 80-100% of peak mileage (+ a taper the last weeks)

I will try to modify the plan with a small taper for the 10km, but for the XC runs I’m considering just to have 2 easy days before the runs and do a “normal” week.

.  
**Questions that pop up in my head**

* Is 40 mpw (the mileage I intend to run next week) a correct peak mileage based on my history?  
*11/14 of the last weeks have been in the 27-40 miles range, 35+ the last 3 weeks and still feel strong. Plan will not reach 40 until week 9*  
* I’m not gonna set any goals for my Marathon in September yet, but will there be enough base for completing it with 2 months extra training after this plan? (suggestions?)
* Any tips for how to incorporate the XC races into a plan?
* Am I biting off more than I can chew?

**Bonus question**  
I’m also considering to buy a pair of racing flats (I’ve become a bit of a shoe geek), but not sure if I should just use them once a week for a short run at the track or if I should consider running races in them (sub-marathon I guess).

I completed my 4th full marathon this past November in 3:10:30 and I'm looking to work on my speed for 5k and 10k distances with the hope that it will carry over a little into my marathon running as well. Last spring (March/April), I ran a 5:23 mile and a 19:24 5k (PRs at both distances). I trained with Daniels' Running Formula (DRF) using my 5:23 to set my workout paces for the marathon training. During the marathon, I hit the wall around mile 17-18 because my stomach just refused to accept the same stuff I had been eating on all my long runs (that were at a slower pace than marathon goal pace).

With this new marathon time as my most recent race, I thought it would be appropriate to use it to set my training paces for the 5-15k program in DRF. After building up to close to my desired weekly mileage since November, I did my first track workout today. 5x(200R + 200 recover + 400R + 400 recover). DRF recommends my 200R pace be :44 and 400R to be 1:28. I found it comfortably hard to be running these repeats at 3-6 seconds faster than recommended, especially with the recovery distances thrown in.

I'm not sure I could hold the same pace for 2.5 miles continuously, but I'd like to. How do I go about building up endurance at speed? Should I slow down on these repeats to match what DRF recommends? Granted, this is my first day of doing speedwork like this and I'll probably be a little sore tomorrow. However, my mile threshold pace is supposed to be 6:40-6:50. I can definitely do better than that because I was doing 2x20:00 at 6:20-6:30/miles during marathon training. 

I feel like I have the speed, but no endurance at that speed. The 5:23 mile and 3:10 marathon lead to very different vDot scores. What do you guys think?",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,,True,t3_p0tj7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/p0tj7/training_speed_endurance/,

I am a 16year old male and about 5'11 in height w/o shoes weigh about 152

Here is some previous history, i've been running about 20-40mpw for about 7 months now and was in 5:20 mile shape back in january but was injured which lead to me missing out most of track, and came back for XC...

Even after running so much, over summer, doing ab workouts etc. etc. I still have tons of body fat which i believe it hinders my ability to be really really really good, i have natural speed (can run about 26/27 for the 200) 

Also form, what exactly is good form? Where you can't hear you footsteps when running? My coaches told me during XC season i have perfect form when sprinting, but when just ""running"" my muscles contract or stop and it isn't smooth and i tend to brake a lot when i hit the ground, but i've gotten new shoes and my running feels different now...but any ideas on that advancedrunning?

The places where i desire to lose fat in, is
     *Back
     *Thighs, mainly the hamstrings...
     *gluteus maximus (yeah laugh if you want but am serious)
     *Upper arms

I've been doing squats, pushups, situps, exercises with weight ball (russian twists etc. etc. etc.) and none of this tends to go away, and i seriously feel like it is slowing me down.

And i eat pretty healthy, no fast food, not much greasy things, tend to try being really healthy. (warning: i do not eat as much fish/fruit as i should i do ever once in a while such as pineapple/banana)

I will literally do ANYTHING you guys tell me to do to get rid of this (even if it is 400mx10 with 1min rest @ 70 seconds, this was hell haha) . I can provide sfw pics, and perhaps even a video of my running form to get better feedback/understanding of what exactly i mean..

I want to be the best runner I can be, and i've put in hard work i want to get rid of these chains holding me back.

(X-post from r/running),Arve,8,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/n5866/alternative_interval_protocols_xpost_from_rrunning/,"For some reason, Norwegian M.Ds and sports scientists like to research interval protocols. 

Helgerud and Hoff are recommending 4x4 intervals as the go-to method for anything (If you're unaware, it's a protocol very much like Daniels I-paced intervals, or other intervals at VO2max-3K pace - 4x4 minutes of effort, with three minute rests).

Others are not so convinced about 4x4, and like to experiment with alternative protocols. Joar Hansen at Lillehammer University College has been testing an alternative protocol, that I'll dub 30/15. I summed this protocol up in [this r/running post](http://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/n4ri4/another_day_another_interval_protocol/).  The theory goes that for a given workout length, 30/15 actually gives you more time spent in intensity zone 5, with intensity zones defined as the Norwegian Olympic Comittee. (The only copy I've found online of those intensity zones is [here](http://www.olympiatoppen.no/fagavdelinger/trening/utholdenhet/fagartikler/oltsintensitetsskala/page594.html), and is essentially working at 94-100% of VO2max. 

My question remains much the same as I asked in the r/running thread - has anyone been doing any work with protocols similar to 30/15, and what kind of results have you seen.  In addition, are there any ups and downs to such a method that one should be aware of, if thinking about incorporating it into their training?",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,,True,t3_n5866,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/n5866/alternative_interval_protocols_xpost_from_rrunning/,

This is my first post on Reddit, which means its also my first post to advanced running as well.  I'm heading into my freshman year in college, and I will be joining my school's club XC/Track team.  It's a really big school (D1) whose D1 team is really good, and I'm not fast enough to be on the actual team yet.  This is why I've come to you all.  I'm wondering if you guys think it's possible for someone like me to ever have a chance making the actual team as a long term goal.  In highschool I was a pretty decent runner.  My times through my junior year were pretty weak, but in my senior year I really picked it up.  My best 5k was a 17:26, but I was still improving quit a bit, so I know that can be better.  In track I ran a 4:48 mile and a 10:04 two mile.  So basically, all I'm asking is, how possible is it for me to get my 5k time down to the 15's so that my 8k's can be in the 26-ish range?  I would say I'm a pretty determined individual, but I guess I'm just worried about physical capabilities.  Also, to anyone out there who is or was on a D1 school's team, how possible is it for me to make the team?  I'm not worried about being one of the top athletes on the team, I would be extremely satisfied with ""warming the bench"".  Thanks guys!  

EDIT:  Thanks everyone for the replies!  To answer a few questions, yes the school's club team is competitive, and there is no way I won't be running club if varsity is unrealistic for me.  I am excited for the club team, and I was just exploring the possibility of seeing how I would do or train for a D1 team.

When I saw the ""1"" it didn't really tell me anything I didn't already know, I overdid that workout. I could sort of feel it :p

I know a lot of people take a note of their recovery HR in their logs, the question then becomes: What do they use it for?

Since it seems to vary a lot with heat, nutrition, daily form and workout intensity, is it really possible to pick out any trends? Is a decline in recovery HR an indicator of overtraining? Loosing fitness? 

Is a steady recovery HR an indicator of aerobic stagnation? I would guess it could be, but with all the variables how can you rely on the data?

Yup that is right sprinting.,danxorhs,7,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1fp2gm/danxorhs_back_how_the_end_of_the_season_went_and/,"Hey there guys! I am back after 3-4 months from my last thread on this subreddit you can see it here http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/18uz4f/update_on_danxorhs_1st_meet_yesterday_probably/ and follow my previous threads here over the course of a year so far.

**400m**So I guess I should start off with, I ended up running a 52.1 400m at the end of the season and me and my 4x4 team were able to make it to regionals  Sadly we did not make it to states, but making it to regionals was a big deal for us.

**200m** time was only officially I believe a 23.8 but the same kid in practice who ran a 23flat, the last half of the season I had always beat him in everything even timed 100m stuff in practice, anything it dealt with speed I started to beat him. I just never had a chance to run the 200m fresh which sucks but I personally believe i could have dipped into the sub 23 zone had I never had to run the 400m first. 

**100m** time unofficially is 11.3 from a home meet we had, and I had gotten faster after that staying with our state champion pole vaulter who could run a 11.1/11.2 in sprint stuff we would also do. 

So roughly I would say I at the end of the season I was at 100m-11.3, 200m-sub23 or low 23., 400m - low 52's

Now why am I here? Well towards the every end of the season week of districts and regionals my legs were ridiculously heavy and it was rough trying to sprint is this because I had been working hard since december and it finally caught up to me? It's just a question I am curious about.

**Second, I desperately need your help**
I am trying to walk onto my Universities track team, it is a D1 program. I had called the coaches and they told me I cannot walk on but what I noticed on FL milesplit was their times for the 100/200/400 were similar to my times, it would make no sense they wouldn't let a kid close to those times who is hard working join the team?

Well, turns out theres a new head coach and the program is being taken to the next level. The coach told me to essentially contact my highschool coach and for him to give me a schedule/stuff to do until october/november which is when tryouts are and essentially I have to be at 100m- sub 11 or close; 200m- sub 22; and 400m-sub 50 for me to be even considered to be walking on. 

Do you guys think it is possible with enough hard work over the next 4-6 months that it is possible to reach those times?

Now, is anyone here willing to make a entire schedule and perhaps videos to see on how to train myself for a 200m/400m runner? My coach is making one, and he still hasn't sent it.. (he said this week) but I also would like a 2nd one, not that I do not trust him or anything I just would like to see my options out there and how to train myself, it is possible you guys can give me way more advice or videos for the 3point stance thing (which i still do not know how to do, i always ran my sprints standing up...)

I was able to find a incoming freshmen who is willing to train with me everyday, and a guy who was a 400m/800m runner and wants to train with us but I have no idea what the 400m/800m will do if hes training with us who will be 200m/400m guys. I asked the university if they could help me and they said due to NCAA rules they cannot give me advice, workouts, or use their facilities at all. The university I am at has a amazing gym and healthy food, a practice track, a indoor 200m track. It is just awesome.

If anyone decides to help me out, please reply here or pm me! I will reply. And to anyone who wishes me the best thanks, it has been interesting transitioning from a shitty distance runner, to a pretty good sprinter.

**I am willing to bust my ass every goddamn day to make it onto this team. I have the work ethic for it and I just need someone to guide me along for me to achieve it.**

**Tl;dr: I need a schedule for the next 4-6months for a 200m/400m, another guy will train with me. And if possible a 400m/800m schedule as well.**

I recently started running again after 9 years of very little exercise. After graduating high school in 2003 I had run about 200 miles before this recent start up.

My last year of running before the long break was very disheartening seeing as though I made little to no improvement. I had been pushed by fellow runners up until that point but during my senior year there was no one near my skill level and I was running to stay in shape more than to improve. I ran a 9:39 3200m during the end of my junior year was aiming for 9:15 my senior year which I didn’t come close to. With a 9:42 being the best I could do with the second fastest person on my team being an 11:15 I hung up my running shoes and didn’t continue in college.

I have always had to the goal of running the Boston Marathon but was never able to get back into shape without injuring myself quickly. With this recent attempt I found a group to run with that helped me keep the pace and mileage slow and low when starting out.

About the races: -The first 5k was just 3 weeks after I started training and I wanted to use it to gauge my speed and abilities at this point. It was a flat course and breaking 20 minutes was the goal that I set and barely met. I have been blessed with natural talent that allowed me to do so well for my first race. -The 10k that I did in January was extremely painful and forced me to walk 2 times during the duration of the race. I had the goal of breaking 39 minutes and surprisingly did so with very little room to breath. -In April I was a bit worried for this race seeing as though it had a nice 150ft elevation gain in the first .5 miles of the race. I had also been injured for most of February and March so I wasn’t sure how I would do. I had the goal of breaking 18 minutes and fell short seeing as though the hills in this race were too much for me to handle at that speed. The last mile of the race hit me very hard mentally and I told myself I would never race/run again because I never wanted to willingly hurt myself this bad again. -Finally the goal of moving up distances brought me to my first half marathon. I was still trying to recover from my arch injury and couldn’t get my mileage up to properly race this distance. My sister asked me to run this half marathon unaware of how hilly it was but seeing as though she would spot me half the entry fee I decided to suck it up and go for it. Here is the course: http://www.lajollahalfmarathon.com/Assets/La+Jolla+Half+Marathon/LJHM+course+map.pdf It includes an 80ft climb on mile two, 200ft climb from mile 3-5, a brutal 440ft climb from mile 6-7 that destroys your legs, and to top it all off they kill you in the middle of mile 12 with a 150ft climb! Knowing this and how I nearly quit running during my last 5k I decided to run this ½ instead of RACING it. I’d stay in my comfort zone and stopped and walked whenever I felt a little strained. I got strange stares for the people handing out water as I walked up to them stopped and drank :D even took a nice bathroom break right before the big hill! I am extremely happy that I broke 1:30 on such a tough course and with very little effort and helped my mentality towards running for the better.

Qualifier race date: Friday, July 26, 2013, 7PM

Now onto my goal of qualifying for the 2014 Boston Marathon! I had been shooting for 2015 until the recent tragedy which drove me to my new goal. The problem with this is that there are very little Marathons to run in the time left to qualify. I live in Southern California and do not have the income to freely travel the country. I found the marathon I want to get my qualifying time at but there are a few problems with the choice I made. First it is in Massachusetts where the summer humidity is going to be extremely taxing on me for the 3 hours I will be running. I will only be there 3 days prior to the race to get use to these conditions and hope it does not prevent me from completing the marathon. Secondly it is a loop course and I will have to complete 8 3.17 mile loops along with another smaller loop to finish the race. I plan on doing my long runs in this fashion to prepare myself for the dullness of it and to help familiarize myself with this sort of running. The race starts at 7pm which I think will be in my benefit since I will still be on California time. The race in question: http://www.srr.org/events/annual_events/24hour/index.php “Scenic, flat, wheel-measured 3.17 mile loop course around Lake Quannapowitt. The course is well marked with minimal traffic. The course is entirely on paved surfaces (sidewalks, paths, and office park access road) except for a 35 yard section of dirt path. The marathon course is USATF certified (MA10007JK). The marathon is a Boston Qualifier” Now the question is my fellow runners, do you think this is enough time for me to reach my goal? I plan on increase my mileage up 10% each week until the taper. I will solely be doing mileage seeing as though I know I have the speed to run 3:05 or faster it will just be am I physically and mentally strong enough to go the distance!

Due to circumstances (not of my doing, but I have to man up and take ownership of them) I wasn't able to start in my proper place at the start line.  I crossed the start line about 25 minutes behind the gun.  As a result, I was swimming my way up through the crowd for the whole race.

I was using a GPS with the virtual pacer set to my goal pace.  I was almost immediately 30 seconds behind my target pace.  I reckoned that I could still have a go at making it up.  I found a pavement on the edge of the route and got some space to run faster, it was a lot easier to overtake in this place.  After a couple of minutes hard run, even dodging behind the backs of some spectators, I managed to get the 'deficit' down to 8 seconds.  Then my pavement ran out and I had to join back into the main stream.   Almost immediately my deficit was back up at 30 seconds again.  So it went on for the first 5km.

At the official halfway point, my time was actually on target, but I'd used a lot more energy than required.  I'd run further than that due to the winding route I had to take, and very inefficiently because of the fast-slow trajectory I'd been locked into.  Now I'd known that this would be a recipe for disaster, but I don't think I had much choice; I've already run a good time this year, and I was not interested in just completing the course. So needless to say, I was putting out more effort than I could handle for the duration, couldn't keep up all the overtaking, and I missed my target by 20 minutes.

**Summary:** I was an idiot and started too far back, and thereby destroyed my chance at getting my aim time.  Tried anyway, and predictably failed.

As you can imagine, I am pretty dissatisfied with that. There is another race in 6 weeks’ time, which I am currently considering as a fall-back to redeem myself.

I'm a high school senior in his last XC season until college and I need some help with mileage as the big meets come up. Two days ago I ran my PR for the 5k with a 16:54 (previous best was 17:10). Now, I have two (hopefully three) important races left in my season: conference and sections. Sections is the most important race because it determines who goes onto the state meet.

-47 miles

-50 miles (sunday run - no rest day)

-55 miles (sunday run - no rest day)

-55 miles (sunday run - no rest day)
 
What should my mileage per week be looking like this next month? I want my peak to be around sections, where I hope to get around 16:30.

I am currently getting into my summer base-building phase and I have a question about how you handle speedwork during it. I will be 25 next month, about 59 kgs and have been running for like 2.5 years. I am just finished an ironman distance triathlon last month so I have not really been running like I normally would during ekiden season. Since Feb. 3 or 4 days I would have spent running went towards the bike/swim. I still managed a 3:47 marathon during the triathlon and seeing it how it was the first time I ever ran that distance and how it was proceeded by 7.5 hours of other exercise, I am alright with what happened.

Anyways, i have no races planned in the foreseeable future, so now seems like a good time to start building a base. This is the first time I am going to try and do this properly and I am prepared to run long and slow throughout the summer so that my body is ready for the real speedwork in fall. I am hoping to set some PRs in the 5km and 10km come then (sub-17km/ 36' would be awesome).

Anyways, I am thinking of going with something like the [summer of malmo](http://pih.bc.ca/summerofmalmo.html) plan if only for its simplicity. Run a lot, make a few of those days doubles, couple days of light speed work. I like it and I can stick to it. 

My question comes with trying to determine how much and how fast to run the workouts at. He says 200s, but my group almost only does 400s - and even then these guys like to run until their eyes are in the back of their heads every workout. 

-What kind of pace should I be looking at for 400s and how fast?

-Also, with the tempo runs, what kind of pace do you think is good? Why only 4-6 miles, we usually do 10 miles at slightly slower than 10km pace - these seems like they provide different benefits, I wonder if one is better at this time, at the very beginning of the season.

Any stuff you guys have to say about what you do during summer base building would be great. Right now I am only at like 55 km a week, but I want to get up to around 100km by July. Like I said, I am new to this element of training and I want to do it smart, so that I am not burned out come fall, but ready to hit the track and pick up some speed.

Thanks!

So what is my maximum heart rate? Obviously at least 185 ( and I was trying to find the max, I doubt I could get it much higher than that). And is it good, bad or indifferent that my max in practice is higher than in theory? Or should I doubt the accuracy of my Garmin's heart rate feature?

I also have heard ways of doing it with your heart rate (max heart rate -50) but I don't use a heart rate monitor nor do I plan on getting one.

A couple more quick questions:

-Do your recovery runs change after you run say, intervals versus a hard 10 miler? 
-How long are you recovery runs (and what percentage of your weekly mileage do you think they compose)


Thoughts, how do you all go about it?

I could use some tips.,ThaSentinel,6,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1kn3ki/how_many_of_you_focus_on_turnover_i_could_use/,"I recently decided my turnover rate needed some work, especially as I'm training for longer distances at the moment. 

Hitting 180 has been a challenge, but I'm *always* over 170 now, most of the time hitting around 176 strides/min.  My question is this: the first week I did this, my hamstrings were killing me--sore the entire week (even after easy efforts).  I had to take a week off due to an (unrelated) pulled muscle, and now I'm back into running comfortably--save for the quad soreness I'm now experiencing.  My pace hasn't really taken a hit on my daily runs. In fact, I've found it actually takes effort to go *slower* than 7:15 (give or take) while keeping my turnover high.

Those of you who have worked on turnover in the past--did you experience this soreness if you already had a good base? How many runs per week did you devote to turnover work?  How long did the soreness persist, and did you do anything to alleviate it?

I came into school in mid August with stress fractures i both my fibulas.  I spent about 8 weeks in the pool and that healed up, and I was able to get some end of season XC races in, plus one really early Indoor race in.  I took down time, had a decent indoor season but unfortunately I made the mistake of coming back way too fast, and injured both my IT bands.  I had absolutely no outdoor season.  This past year has been one of the hardest for me running wise because I went through high school without ever missing any more than 2 weeks due to injury.  I've been running for the past three weeks really easy (I just went for a 6 mile run on Sunday) so I'm not pushing at all, but I'm scared that I'm not really doing enough.  I'm expected to be scoring points for the team in both XC and Track and I did nothing last year.

The reason I don't usually use it is because being inordinately skinny, I have to put it on very tight to keep it on. However, when it's this tight it tends to constrict my breathing somewhat, not to mention it's pretty uncomfortable. So is there any way to keep it on when it's looser without it constantly feeling like it's about to fall off (or actually doing so)?


My other question is that the heart rate zones suggested in the book (and elsewhere) for typical runs seem VERY slow for me (for example, it says general aerobic runs should be done at 70-80% of the max heart rate). I run a 1:30 half or 18:50 5k and going by my max heart rate (around 192) and the book I should do my general aerobic runs around 134-154bpm which translates to around 9-10 min/mile for me (or slower) whereas I would previously have done these runs around 7:30-8 min/mile. So will these slower paces still have the desired training effect? Or should I ignore the suggested heart rate and go by pace?

back when I was training and reaching running a 5:10 mile and a 24:30 4.4 mile, I was running on an 1/8 mile indoor track which led to knee pains and more recently I ran the 2011Chicago marathon with two weeks of training and had really bad knee pains (IT bands and patella).I know I probably need to do strength training, but what are some ways (exercise names?

Edit: I know the feasibility of this training schedule is very low and I will adjust it as I run and my body tells me my limits, but what would help me the most are ways to help prevent injury, where/when to inject cross training, best practices post runs, etc. 

edit2: 4:30 is the inspirational/long term goal. What I'd really accomplish is a sub 5 mile and am willing to stretch it out to the entire year if that what it takes.

*If you click it, it links back to my more previous threads on here, for the past few months-year.*

So I took my 2-3 week break, and then started to run. I sort of did the mistake of doing what my coach wanted me to do..and was lifting heavy weights only (really heavy, 8reps,6reps,4reps) did that for about a week. 

I finally get this schedule http://imgur.com/Wzav5 from one of my other coaches, and we start to follow it. I since last week have been running my miles before lifting, or sometimes afterwards and having my wednesday be my longest run.

My coach got pissed off at that session 2 thing, and one of my other coaches told us the day before we should be running about 40mpw right now, and he then creates this schedule... http://imgur.com/zCmUX

I have been skippping those running workouts, and I am following the 1st schedule my other coach gave me. Its ridiculous if I am to do that (we have to do that every week) I will be exhausted by mid-season or at the beginning. Having to race a 2mile, 2x1mile repeat, and 10 400's every week leading up to track, I believe will be a horrible idea what do you guys think?

It also sucks that now i am basically training by myself/myself instead of with the team..but I am willing to do anything to run 2flat or below.

Also we have quite abit of talent on our distance team for track but their having to do those workouts (the 2nd paper) instead of the 1st paper...which sucks there is a girl who ran 12minutes for the 2mile last year but her 5k PR was around 21minutes :/


**So a little about me:** I feel as if I have gotten faster the past 2 weeks lifting weights and such, but I am a little concerned now..**.I weigh 170 now from around 155** which is odd since i was trying to weigh less, shit theres a kid who has been doing the same lifting as I have and he went from 146 to 138.. Plus I even have been eating less.

Also I ran a 600m about 3 weeks ago and got 1:43 no spikes on, had destroyed old shoes (got new ones now) and did not give it my all the last 200m, I feel as if i had ran it with spikes and how I am right now I could hit 1:35 or below.

**What else should I be doing everyday? Continueing that schedule and running my distance is good? Or should i try to incorporate some speed or strides everyday as well? Just things in general I can do to help me improve.**

**My last concern is that: Is there any supplements or drinks I should be taking for lifting or trying to lose weight? How about certain diet plans anything out there I can follow? And is there anyone willing to watch slow-motion recordings of my stride/form and analyze it for me? Also what are your opinions on the schedules?**",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,,True,t3_14krcw,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/14krcw/reporting_in_for_a_update_on_myself_danxorhs/,

I'm a 21 year old male who has been running for the past 7 years. I was a middle of the line runner in high school [17 min 5k (xc), 10 min 2mi (track)]. I've continued to run through college and last year finished my season with my first 10-mile race and my first half-marathon (1h 20m). 

In looking through a lot of people's training plans, I feel like I've been really undertraining in terms of logging mileage. I followed Hal Higdon's advanced half-marathon plan last year, which provides a solid blend of tempo/speed/long runs, topping out under 50 mi per week at the end. However, it seems like a lot of successful runners out there (including those on my university's xc team) are logging anywhere from 60-85 mi weeks, something I've never even thought about doing.

But in terms of a long-term plan for a healthy, somewhat-skilled runner who hopes to transition to full marathons competitively in the next few years, do you think there would be a lot to gain from logging as many miles as I can for the time being rather than focusing on speed?

 So my question is this: If I show up early and run in lane 8 or the grass that is the football field next to lane one, will I injure myself? I would be running 4-5 miles, maybe 6 miles, switching directions every mile.

To achieve minimal arm movement and I've been trying to **keep my wrists as near my nipples as possible,** as some experienced runners suggest.
I find that this technique seems to aid hip flexor action and increase my stride rate.
The problem is: it also seems to be causing me pain in my levator scapulae muscles around mile 10 of my long runs.

I've had moderate success thus far in shorter events (17:41 5k, 1:27:00 HM) and am now looking to fake my way through a marathon.  Here's my current program:

* Mon: 4ish mile tempo @ 5% slower than 5k race pace. 1-2 mile WU/CD.
* Wed: 2-3 miles worth of intervals.  200m-1600m faster than 5k race pace. 2-3 mile WU/CD.
* Thurs: 5-7 miles at goal marathon race pace (slower if hilly).
* Sat or Sun: 90-120 minutes long run.  15-30 sec mile slower than goal marathon pace.
* at random: I do an extra set of strides sometimes, but not that often.

I have a couple questions on possible improvements I could make in the 6 weeks I have left:

* Would it be beneficial to be really rigorous about doing strides?
* My long runs end up in the 13-18 miles range.  Is it important to go longer even if it will cut into my other workouts?
* Is running a tempo after my long run hurting me?  My legs usually feel ok the day after my long run, but I worry it's not enough recovery.  Maybe switch the days I do the tempo and the marathon race pace run?
* Anything else I could be doing?

I'd be pretty stoked if I could BQ (3:05 for me), but am worried I'll hit the wall and fail.

I guess I should start out and say that in my youth, I was a pretty decent runner. I was top 10 for CC in California and have a couple cool National accolades from my prime. I was fortunate enough to be talented enough to get a D1 Scholarship to pay for my school. Sadly, a couple unforeseen events in my life took a toll and eventually lead me to quit running at the age of 21. At that time I was running 14:45 for my 5K, 4:02 for my mile, 1:51 for my 800. About a month ago I signed up for my first race in 5 years; a 5K. 

As for my training: I'm running at least 5 times a week with two or three of my runs being decent workouts. I've lowered my 5K pace down to about 6:15/mile in my workouts. I feel pretty decent about my runs and I think I'm starting to feel like an actual runner again. 

However, I digress. I'm terribly worried about this 5K such in the fact that I've never ran a 5K under 19 mins from when I was a Freshman in HS. 

I read a lot about people just saying, ""Oh just do couch to 5K."" Not to sound too snobby, because even after 4 weeks, Couch to 5K just isn't going to give me the workouts I need. I'd seriously feel like I wasn't working hard enough if I just did those. 

With all that said, anyone have any suggestions on how I should progress my workouts? I'm having a problem of thinking that I can do 6x800s at 5K pace and then feeling great for 3-4 of them however I just end up dying towards the end. I have this mental outlook that if I'm running at 6 min/mile pace, it's too slow; I just feel like I'm so much better than that. 

I used to feel on top of the world when I used to compete seriously, and now I feel I'm about to embarrass myself.",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,,True,t3_si2ev,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/si2ev/trying_to_make_a_comeback_what_should_i_expect/,

I'm a longtime lurker, first time (I think...) poster in r/advancedrunning. In high school, I wasn't much of a runner. Went from 24 min 5k (9th grade - 2008?) to a 21 min 5k in xc my senior year (2010-11). But in track senior year, I dropped from my PR of 5:36 to 4:22 in the mile. I was off the wall excited, and felt like I might have a chance to run in college.

Come freshman year, I decided to try out for my D1 varsity track team. I was told by the coach that my times were not good enough to get me onto the team, so I would have to do a time trial. Mid-October I showed up for the time trial held by the assistant coach. I warmed up with a friend and raced a few 800s. About a week later, I received an email that they now wanted me to try out for the head coach. I was pretty excited, but they never gave me a date.

About a week later, I went for a Saturday long run and about 12 miles in, pain erupted in my Achilles. I had severe tendinitis and would be unable to finish my tryout. The doctors said I might not be able to run again. I was heartbroken, became anorexic, and severely depressed.

Now, 2 years later, I am happily recovered and injury-free (knock on wood) and ready to get back in the game. I'm running a time trial today for what will be the first of many workouts towards my goal of making the team and ultimately breaking 4:00. I'll post back here with my results and the rest of my training program.

I hope that the more experienced runners here will be able to give me some advice/answers and comment on my workouts (I will post here daily either in the comments or as an edit) and I could definitely use all the encouragement I can get, as it's going to be a long journey. :)

**My History**

Sorry for the length that will follow, but I'll try to only highlight the main points.

**Freshman year** high school I try out track. Realize I'm pretty good at it and like it. Do the 400m. Unfortunately I suffered from an inflamed groin which took me out for a bit. The groin injury still haunts, several years later. Whenever I increase to a high mileage load my groin pain begins to come back. As a result I don't go above 40 mile weeks, and stay away from runs longer than 8 miles.

**Sophomore year** high school I do track again. I try out the 800m and realize I'm a lot better at that with a 2:08 800m compared to my 54 400m. Talk to the cross country coach and decide to do XC the next year.

**Junior year** high school I do cross country. As soon as we increased the mileage and intensity I started hurting, a lot. Decided to keep it to myself, but after 6 weeks the pain was to much for me and I told my coach. Had to go to the doctors. Learned my groin was inflamed again, had very bad shin splints, and on top of that I had a stress fracture. Doctor said not to run, but stupid me decided I could make it until state qualifiers since my team needed me. Fast forward to weeks and I have the race of my life, but someone tripped me 400m from the finish. If I hadn't tripped we would of gone to state =( I had a lot of pain in track, which prevented me from doing a lot of the workouts. Still had an okay season though. Even decided to try the mile and finished with a 4:50.

**Senior year** high school XC was horrible. Started with injuries from the start and was never able to make up the ground I lost. This is where it gets freaky. For my track season I was determined not to get injured. I did this by....not practicing. I did 4 speed workouts the entire season and ran 15 miles a week at the most, usually 10. My abs went away and I grew a nice belly. Despite this though, I reached my peak. Even though I was out of shape, I was able to run without pain. Doing so allowed me to get my PR of 4:37

So there you have it. My running history. I'm now in my second semester of my freshman college year. Right now I can maintain a 6:50 pace for about 7 miles. That's the only benchmark I have. I'm not running for any team so I now have the opportunity to start fresh. I know I have a lot more potential and am far from my peak. I want to get there the right way, by building from the ground up.

So I ask for your advice. What can I do to start from the beginning so that I can be a strong, competitive runner that doesn't have to worry about hurting himself more than the normal runner?

I suppose I should typically start with, well, the beginning, but it really would make more sense to do a quick summary and then get into the meat of the story. Note that this will be a bit long.
I started running Freshman year of high school. Running was basically one of the main reasons why I chose the school I did. It was always something I strove to do in high school. Unfortunately I got injured (stress fracture) at the end of Cross Country and missed a month and a half of training. I had a miserable Indoor season and was cut from Outdoors. I then went on to train on my own until I made the team again during a summer time trial.
Sophomore year I ran okay I guess. I never had the great commitment at that point in time and just kinda accepted everything as it came to me. I didn't really aim for anything big. That's kinda what screwed me over, and I hate myself for it, but I was cut from both indoor and outdoor track that year. I trained my ass off though, and went into Cross the next year in the best shape of my life.
But that's when I got a second stress fracture, during my Junior year. This time I missed September to the middle of December with only biking and other cross-training to tide me over. I had a relatively bad Indoor season, then relapsed into my injury and didn't make the time trial because of it and was cut from Outdoors.
Now here I am during my Senior year at the end of summer training, almost time for Cross Country. Since Indoors of Junior year I kept telling myself I was going to make varsity (an incredibly difficult feat for the school I was running for), but at this point I honestly think I don't have any time left. Three seasons is hardly enough to do anything. I'm so committed right now, but I don't think commitment will help me achieve my goals in three seasons. What should I do? Please, if you can offer any advice, I would be so thankful. This is something I haven't really shared with anyone else.
If you took the time to read but don't have any advice to offer, I thank you for taking the time to do so anyway.

I am going to be a freshman in college this fall and I compete seriously. I have a few questions about buying shoes:

* **Since I run Cross Country in the fall but focus on 200m-400m hurdles during the Winter/Spring season, should I use different shoes for the different seasons?**

Throughout HS I always used the same shoe for the year but when I do speed training for Winter/Spring, I always wish I had a lighter pair.


* **How can I find a good shoe?**

Until last year I never experienced issues, but I got hit with pretty bad shin splints and arch uncomfort. The stores around here really only have salesmen, not really knowledgable people. Is there a chain of some sort I should look up, or how do I figure this out on my own?




I guess I should add that I generally put in ~15-25 mpw during training last year (will surely increase soon) and that I'm looking at the Nike Frees for when I do speed/hurdle training. 

* **How good are these?** 

* **Can I use them for a whole year, or should I actually buy a separate pair?**

* **What are good shoes with support that I can use for Cross Country/distance runs (if it is recommended to have a separate pair)?**

* **As far as competition, I will definitely use different shoes for the seasons. Any reccomendation on racing spikes? I don't need new ones just yet as I am not competitng atm, but I know I'll be looking again soon.**

Right now I am around 25 MPW, but hope to get into the 40s soon. I ran XC in highschool and really love to race, so in lieu of a weekly/bi-weekly quality session I have been racing this bi-weekly 5k series; times have dropped from 19:55, to 19:05, to 18:55 with a very similar average HR. As I have only been running regularly ""this time"" for around 10 weeks I feel like this is all credited to improved running economy and endurance. 

The Marathon is the week before thanksgiving and I am hoping to run at least 7:30s. I was looking at a 10 miler in Auguest, a 10 miler in September, a half marathon in September and a half in October before focusing on 18-22 mile training runs and dialing in for race day. My hope is that the longer races will prepare me to feel out a long distance race pace and find the sweet spot between zone 2 and 3, but I am a little worried that 4 long-hard races with leave me with more fatigue and injury opportunity than they are worth. Is a season with 4 long races a bit ambitious when setting up for a marathon? 

Side note: according to equivalent performance charts, which I know get less accurate the bigger the differential in race distances, an 18:55 5k equates to a much faster marathon than a 3:20 *with equivalent preparation.* My thought process is that maybe the long races help me open up some of this potential.

I injured my calf in December, and didn't start running again until February-ish. I resolved to spend most of this year just recovering and building a solid-base for a fairly hilly marathon in October; the main goal was just steady, steady mileage for an awesome base.

Right now I'm at 56 miles a week, ready to bump up to 64 soon. I've been fairly conservative, so I really only have one quality day a week (this is base building, remember!). I've mostly done long-runs on hills, though I recently switched it up a bit by doing marathon-pace runs as well (also on hills). Right now my long-run is at 17 miles and my marathon-pace runs at 8 miles (+2 easy warm-up/cool-down).

My question is: How should I develop my quality runs for the remaining 3 months? The way I see it, I can either:

* Work on getting up to 20 mile long runs, and then maintain those for a while. Maybe do a few marathon-pace runs for variety, though these probably wouldn't be farther than 10 miles.
* Work on increasing the length of marathon-pace runs, while doing enough occasional long-runs to have one 20 miler before the marathon.
* Long-runs mixed with marathon-pace runs; seems like best of both worlds, but I'm not sure if this would be overkill while base-building.

In that season I mostly ran the 1600, setting a PR of 4:49 at the end of the season. I didn't run much over the summer, and subsequently had a fairly shitty cross country season, achieving a 5k PR of 17:46. Not wanting to make the same mistake I did with cross country, I talked with my coach and set up a training plan for running over the winter. I ended up running 30-35 mpw coming into track season. My times over the course of this track season are listed by date as follows:

* 4/13- **1600** 5:07

(Warning: slight wall of text)

**Some background**:
I'm a runner of average ability (25, male), I've run a couple of 5Ks and 4 half marathons in 2 years. My 5K time is 22:20, my HM time is 1:56. Every running calculator I find tells me I should be able to do a faster HM given what my 5K time is, and it seems I don't have enough of an aerobic base.

So I picked up Phil Maffetone's Big Book of Endurance Training, figured out what my aerobic target heart rate should be (around 155bpm), and have been doing all my runs in the range of 145-155bpm. I've finished 2 weeks of aerobic training so far. This is the first time I'm following any sort of training regimen, from a book no less, so any input is welcome.


**Questions**

1. My pace is really, really slow when staying within this heart rate. I'm guessing that's normal, but how long should it be before I notice an improvement? The book says 1-2 months for seeing results, so I'm definitely going to stick with this for at least 6 weeks.

2. I'm doing all my runs at this heart rate. Right now, this means I'm doing 5 miles a day, 5 days a week, and a longer run once a week (10 miles this week). These numbers will gradually go up, but is this the right thing to do? Should some runs be even slower? Should the long run be a little faster?

3. Speedwork - the book says stay off speedwork till there's a decent aerobic base built, so I'm avoiding speedwork - no tempo/interval/pace runs. Good or bad? 

4. I'm doing all of this in Bombay, India where the weather is &gt;85F and 80% humidity every day, even in the morning (I run around 7AM). Because of the heat, I end up having to go really slow, sometimes having to walk to get my heart rate within target range. I did one long run on a treadmill indoors, and I was able to stay in range for a lot longer with a faster pace than outdoors.
My question is, does the heat hamper aerobic training? Should I be adding, say, 10bpm to my aerobic range to account for the heat since my heart rate probably is higher to keep my body cooler, not because of the running effort?

5. Weight training: I want to lose some weight and get some core work in too, so I'm planning to add a weight routine twice or thrice a week. I have plenty of time these days (between school and work), so I can afford the time and the rest right now. Is adding weight routines a good idea with aerobic training? The book said even slight anaerobic training might hamper aerobic conditioning, so I'm not too sure about this.

Thanks in advance for any advice, much appreciated.

Some basic info: Have jogged on and off for a decade or so before finally working my way back to running religiously over the last two years.

I finally got to the point of running a marathon in January at a slovenly 5:30 time. I had not really trained enough (18 miles was my longest run and had only hit 50 miles in one or two weeks).

I have set the probably unrealistic goal of cutting that time down to 3:30 by January 2013. I aquired a copy of Advanced Marathoning (Pfitzinger and Douglas). My current plan is to build mileage and lose weight (currently 225lbs at 6 foot even) until eighteen weeks before the marathon, then pick up whatever training plan in the book meets my mileage at that point. 

Currently I am doing the first cycle of the 55-70 mile per week plan but skipping any speed work in the interest of increasing mileage.

For the half marathon my times average @2:02, and I finished the marathon @5:21 (pushing a stroller with my two yr-old) After the first two half marathons, I realized that the inside of my ankle was starting to get very tender right around the ankle bone, so for the third HM I opted to run with a compression ankle sleeve...Much better. For the marathon, I used the same brace and I got much further before I felt any real discomfort. At mile 19, OUCH...started getting very hot on the inside of my ankle, forcing me to change my step for my right foot, and implement the 10:1 that I learned about in /r/running. The rest of the run hurt like hell, but thanks to my training I felt like that was my only problem. Needless to say, BIG PROBLEM for the 7 miles left. It's been about two weeks since the run, no lasting pain, and I've had two 5K's since then. Doesn't really hurt, but I am VERY conscious of my ankle every step of the way.

There is no real way I can ""test"" it because I have been tapering and the problems arise on the later miles.After much research, I've pinpointed the pain to the Posterior Tibial Tendon (PTT) right foot, and found some great KTTaping vids for precisely this.

I'm a highschool 400/800m runner, plus I started cross country for base work this season. This summer I worked up to about 6 easy miles a day with a lot of bodyweight workouts (such as large amounts of body squats) with heavy lifting of front squats and deadlift twice a week, as in front squat on Monday, deadlift on Thursday. I kept that up until recently and felt great. School cross country started out great, I was competing in all the races. I wasn't the best, but I was up there. My problems started a few weeks after the cross country season started though. I PR'd my seconds race with a 17:57, pretty happy. The next week my time dropped significantly, i don't remember what it was, but it wasn't good. Next race was a tiny bit better than the last but still slow. Then I hurt my IT band in practice. After talking to my coach and some other runners I've concluded it's IT Band Syndrome and it's due to overtraining.

My question is have I been handling myself properly?

I took that week off from running, my only exercise  consisted of riding a bike once, which didn't hurt, and occasional core work. Almost every morning, afternoon, and night I would use a PVC pipe and roll out my IT band, along with ice at night. I ran yesterday for an easy 30 minutes with compression right above my knee and felt very little pain. I did a shorter but faster run today with compression and there was even less pain. I plan on one or two more easy runs this week followed by rest and ice.

The injury occurred October 21st and I'm hoping to be ready-ish by this Saturday, the 5th, because it's our regional cross country meet. I know I won't be 100% but I want to try and be competitive, and I know not to push myself past the pain to where I could risk ruining my IT band for much longer. Also is it possible that this injury could carry over to track season?

As far as I can remember, there's only been one meet in the last two years that I didn't PR at. In my mind, that either means I've never peaked, or I've peaked right at the end of the season, which is perfect. I prefer the former because that means I've got untapped potential. Anyway, my freshman year PR was a 19:27, last year's was a 17:43, goal this year is a 16:30, and hopefully by senior year I'm running well below 16 (15:30-15:40 range). Base mileage for the summer has been around 40 mpw - not as high as I would have liked, but I've been doing a lot of hiking when I'm out of town to try to compensate - plus a tempo run and a distance run once a week.

/r/AdvancedRunning, I've come to you for tips before and you've been a huge help. Got any tips this time around? Current race strategy is start fast (5:40 pace), get faster (~10 seconds off each mile). I wore flats last season solely because they were the lightest shoes I could find (lighter than spikes even); should I take the extra weight in exchange for traction? My kick is decent - enough to not get passed in the last 400m or so; is that okay, or should I worry about passing in that final stretch? How much do I need to worry about diet? Would adopting two-a-days be smart, or is the risk of injury due to higher mileage too high now that the season's starting?

This is the guy who posted ""Training Plan"" a few days back.

Yesterday, I ran a long run of 11.15 miles and was aiming for ~8:00-8:30/mile.  I thought I was running very very comfortably and slowly.  Turns out I was running exactly a 7:00 pace.  I felt as if I could carry on a conversation.  Pace was verified by stopwatch time + three separate online maps for distance on a simple out and back loop on one long, long road.

A few questions:

1.) How do you determine your ideal racing distance?  This has me wondering if I'm more suited for a half-marathon than a mile (though the 4:44 mile is still my ultimate goal).

2.) Is this simply a miscalculation of the proper effort for the long run?  Is this a result of me doing no speedwork and therefore being able to run at only one pace (6:00-7:00) because I have no kick?

3.) Or is it possible that my 19:36 5k was so hilly that I am actually faster than that by far?  I know the second question can only be answered by running another (flat) 5k, but in your experience how much time can an extremely hilly 5k add to your race time?

4.) How would you proceed?  Or just stick to the plan?  My class is running a marathon soon that has the option of a half-marathon in october.  It is for a good cause, but I don't want to run a full so soon and jeopardize my long-term injury-free state.  Is it suitable to use the half as a long run/gauge of my talent at long distance?

Why I ask: Luckily for me I've always been a toe runner, unlike some of my old teammates.

I am of the belief that running fast often comes down to running smart, in direct combination with just sucking it up and not being a poon.

I wrote it for me, so there are certainly some parts that are unclear, but I thought this community may have some interest in this so I decided to post it anyway. If there is a part that's really unclear that you think it would be beneficial to clarify, just let me know and I can probably elaborate.

S2S Relay Race Report:

In the part of myself that I define as a runner (or insofar as running defines me), I have never felt more fully actualized than at times during the S2S Relay. In the course of a single day I experienced all the highs and lows of running more starkly than ever before, and learned that my own endurance and resilience runs deeper than I imagined. Sharing the time, joy and turmoil with five others magnified and diversified the experience even further.

It began in Fort Myers. Some of my teammates had gotten to run already and I was feeling alright. I felt uncertain because I had a headache and wasn’t confident in my nutrition, but the running started out easy, although pretty warm. A mile in and I passed “TO HELL” spray-painted on the sidewalk. An arrow above it was pointing straight where I was going. I laughed at the universe.

The leg went well and I finished the 5.9 miles at a 7:13 pace. We kept moving as the sunset was coming on and soon we were gearing up for night legs with our reflective vests and lights we were ready to fly.
The distinctive sight of a headlamp glowing in the distance –easily distinguished from headlights, streetlamps, and other sources – will be stuck in my mind. Nervous energy would bubble up at the start of each of these night legs, especially when the next leg was mine. Then, when the time came, the energy would burn off in the first mile and questions about pace and sustainability would enter my mind, accompanied by repeated checks of the watch. This concern subsided more and more on each of the night legs. It was replaced to a greater and greater degree by a tremendous sense of serene strength and power and an increasing sense of rapturous awe.

My first night leg was perfect straight for 4.4 miles. After obsessing over the current pace for the first half mile or so, I settled in and felt completely smooth. I had company from the occasional passing car, but otherwise I was primarily pursuing a lit sign that was warning of detour some distance down the road. When that was passed, I fixated on an orange lamp in the distance that utterly failed to get any closer. As the road seemed to stretch ever on and on, I was content because I knew I simply had to keep moving. I finished with a pace of 7:05, and sometime on this leg Friday turned to Saturday.

Night legs’ in-between times are odd. There is not as much to see, so I acquired a sort of narrowing of perception. All there was in the universe was the inside of the van and these narrow, paved bridges taking me from one exchange zone island to the next. It created a strange combination of focus and a sense of unreality. There was also a unique sort of intimacy between us runners as we went through the same novel experience together.

It was around 1 a.m. when we really started to pass other teams. In fact, in my final night leg I passed three runners from different teams. The place was beautiful: I had a 5 mile, straight stretch of the trail on Lake Okeechobee. The sky was clear and full of stars. I ran along in darkness with my eyes on these beautiful points of light. Eventually I saw a new, red light in front of me on the trail. I got to chase this light for about three miles. Much like the lamppost from earlier legs this light stayed resolutely in front of me despite my efforts to close the gap. When I finally did, I must have been averaging 1.5-2 minutes/mile faster than him. My pace for this 5.2 mile leg was 6:57.
I felt alright after my last night leg, if exhausted. It was 3 or 4 a.m. by now and I had not slept: I hadn’t felt sleepy enough. I had a long rest (42 miles) before my next leg, which was also the longest leg in the entire race. We had on-the-course breakfast the directors organized at a local church, but food was entirely unappealing. I wanted to find a soft patch of anything and just sleep. I wasn’t so sure I could make it. I kept trying to nap, but struggled to doze. I was hungry but didn’t have an appetite. My body was rebelling against me. On the other hand, my legs felt pretty much OK, with a pretty standard sort of deep (but mild) fatigue. Nothing was burning or felt like it had ripped and I hadn’t cramped up at all. So on this I was optimistic.

Despite having 42 miles of rest and preparation, when the exchange finally came I was a little unaware. It went smoothly, but by the time I had gotten a (much slower) mile in I felt thirsty. Less than two miles in I was getting stabbing sideache/abdominal cramping that slowed me to slower than 7:30 pace. I never really thought it but I at least thought about thinking about walking. I told myself to relax and let it pass. And it did. I began feeling better and better. A crop duster made a few passes overhead and the entire time I was buffeted about by semis and Mack trucks blowing by me at 60 mph. My pace picked up pretty quickly and I was back in the low sevens for the next mile or so. The sun was coming up to my right and the light was beautiful and the air was fresh, so the deck was stacked in my favor environmentally in most ways at least. At about 5 miles in, my team finally arrived to provide some support. At miles five and seven I had some water at least – it felt like my cramps could come back at almost any moment. I kept getting faster as the leg went on and even though I added an extra furlong or so, I managed to finish with a 6:57 pace for 8.9 miles. I felt on top of the world after that leg.

I felt like crap 20 minutes later. It was the same as the early morning doldrums, except it was light out this time. I got a little sleep here and there, and was terrified at the prospect of my final leg coming up. It was getting hot.

The heat struck a teammate down. He finished his fifth leg and was barely coherent for several minutes. We got him cooled and he reiterated the fact that he was done. It was only 10 a.m. but the heat must have already been above eighty. We still had about 40 miles to run. Everyone was slowing down, often by a half minute or more. We rearranged the final legs to make up for our lost runner and hoped for 
the best.

My last leg was hot. It was six miles through Stuart. I felt OK and kept moving with a pace in the high 7s, but man was it hard. We were giving out much better support at this point, and I got a couple of water stops. I kept running, hit a bridge (which sucked) and missed a turn. Of course, I didn’t know I missed the turn. I ended up running/walking an extra 3.5 miles because of it. I tried borrowing phones to get in touch, but it wasn’t working out. It was then that I realized I had arrived at the destination my first leg graffiti had alluded to – I was in hell. I managed to retrace my steps and ran into the team van. I cost the team 45 minutes.

Even though my race ended very poorly, the experience was still amazing. I drank roughly six times my share of beer (totaling about 6-8 pints) and ate absurd quantities of chicken and pasta and other foodstuffs, and basically hung out at a beautiful park for the afternoon. I can see nothing wrong with that.",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,,True,t3_rot11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/rot11/my_endurance_relay_race_report/,
1332982255.0,4,self.AdvancedRunning,rigu7,Dumb Questions: My First Half Marathon,karmapolice3000,8,4,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/rigu7/dumb_questions_my_first_half_marathon/,"Exactly a month from today, I'll be running the first half marathon of my life.  Background: I ran cross-country in HS, wasn't too bad at that if I may say so myself, but since then let myself go for a few years.  I ran a little bit for fitness and that was about it.  Now I'm a senior in college and since deciding to run this half a couple months ago, I've built up quickly to be going much further than I ever ran in high school.

Anyway, I have a bunch of dumb questions:

- How ridiculous is it for my goal to be total victory?  The winning time last year was 1:17:04 and I honestly think I can beat that with enough training.  Thoughts?

- How far should my maximum runs be?  My long runs have been around 14 miles max so far (in ~2 hrs) and I'm thinking I'll go farther over the next few weeks...is this overkill?

- What should my mix of speed to distance be?  So far I've been taking an easy run about every other day when I need to recover, distance about twice a week, and speed work about once a week?

- Also, speed work.  How far should I be going?  How many reps? At what target pace?  I have a track nearby so I can time my miles, but I haven't used it yet.

- Strength training.  I've been weightlifting as well, just for general fitness.  I've been doing squats, hamstring curls, and calf raises; generally at fairly high weight for low reps.  This makes me incredibly sore the next couple days I run.  Should I back off on this?  I feel that if it hurts this much it's got to be doing something for me, but maybe I should concentrate more on the running...

- Finally, rest.  When should I stop training before the half?  It's on a Saturday morning, so I think my last hard workout will be Wednesday and then I'll do real easy runs the next couple days.  Thoughts?

Sorry for the massive wall of text but I've never done this before, and I really feel I have a shot at placing if not winning here.  Thanks!",,False,self,t5_2t1rd,False,,,True,t3_rigu7,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/rigu7/dumb_questions_my_first_half_marathon/,

If not, here's an imgur link:

Anyway, so far the plan has worked quite well.  The mileage increases have been manageable, the workouts make sense, and the plan works on a plateau system with rest weeks of less mileage before jumping up again.  All things I've been liking so far.

HOWEVER - I've looked a few weeks ahead in the plan and am a bit worried about the 36-mile week that comes after the 31.  It has me doubling up a hill-repeat session and a fartlek on the monday, and still doing a longer run on the saturday.  So I'm adding a bunch of mileage, as well as doing a rather significant double that I've never tried before.

1374881196.0,2,self.AdvancedRunning,1j4ohz,Long Term Injury Seeking Any Advice Possible,akolesar,2,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1j4ohz/long_term_injury_seeking_any_advice_possible/,"So, this will be a long post, I've been struggling with an injury for nearly eight months now and have tried a vast array of things for it, and it has improved, but it simply will not leave completely. 

Let me start off. I am a collegiate runner for an NCAA division 2 atlantic school. I start my sophomore year in about a month. I had a great opening xc season last year, having my high school PR for the 5k become my 10k xc pace. blah blah blah things were great. 

Come winter I started running exclusively roads for the winter training because of the snow, I now know this caused my injury along with some form issues(will explain later). Up to about 45-55 miles/week I started having a pain in my lower left tibia that was something like a shin splint. Also with some generalized achilles/foot pain. I simply shrugged it off until it became too bad to deal with anymore. Looking back this was the worst possible thing to do and the reason I am here now not running. But hindsight is 20/20, they say. 

So I took some time off, and it improved slightly, but I couldnt get back to running without a fair amount of pain. After seeing my athletic trainer he mentioned either stress fracture or stress reaction. Seeing a team doctor I was given an X-Ray, it showed a bony prominence on my tibia, showing there is surely a stress reaction. I chose not to get an MRI to diagnose a stress fracture as both injuries would be treated in a similiar way. 

So I gave the word to red shirt indoor track, and soon after outdoor. I started with increasing my rest a lot, rarely leaving my dorm room except for practice, class and food. By this time about 2-3 months have passed since I got this injury, and it is not nearly as painful, but it is always there, and that is much of the focus of this post. So I'm left with this dull feeling resembling an ache in my tibia, it is no longer painful but still there, and I know that if I were to start running again, my injury would recur very quickly. 

Trying to solve this issue I booted my leg for 3 weeks with minimal improvement. I got a second opinion from my home orthopedist who did a wrist surgery for me in the past and he agreed with the original doctor's finding. Around this time I'd also been using a bone stimulator that I had leftover from a previous injury, I figured it couldn't hurt. 

So the spring semester ended and I still had this stupid dull feeling in my leg that I knew was a remnant of this injury. At the start of this summer I started getting desperate. I paid a fair amount out of pocket to see a professional athletic trainer for a major sports team. He gave me a lot of helpful insight as to why the injury occured(form work, how to change it, ect.), and it was his opinion that rehabilitation exercises were my best option of recovery. Getting a plan made from my trainer at school, I started that routine more than a month ago, and it has not helped much to this point. 

So my current situation is that I am red shirting this fall's cross country season. If the season ends with me still struggling I'll have spent nearly a year with this injury. If it comes to that point I'm considering leaving the sport of running or taking a long hiatus. 

Some other important things I feel I have left out:

I drink plenty of milk

I have custom fit orthotics

I change my shoes regularly

I rehab 2-3x weekly

 I have seen 2 doctors and 2 athletic trainers for this injury

Alcohol, different shoes, and stress aggravate this injury. 

So Please! any advice at all is welcomed. Running used to be such a big part of my life and it really sucks that it is gone. 

TL;DR

Struggling with a long term(8mo) stress reaction in lower left tibia, tried many things. It is no longer painful but still present. I am currently in rehab but not seeing very much improvement after more than a month. I have a good knowledge now of what caused my injury and how to prevent it in future, but I need advice on how to heal it currently.

**Important questions/info in bold:** 

So Its been what 29 days since my last post here?

Last thursday we had a mock meet and it seems I had ran the 400m in about 52-53s (which is about a 2-3 second drop since 3-4 weeks ago)

Yesterday was my first meet of the season and was scheduled to run the 400m,200m, and 4x4.

**400m time -** low 55s (thought was faster but i felt very tight due to it being very cold yesterday in florida..weird weather)

**200m time -** 24s (I could have went way faster but I was whining in my head I gotta run the 4x4 i can't be tired and i am tired from the previous 400m it was a meet with only about 5 teams so the meet went by quick + i was freezing at the starting line)

**4x4 split - mid 53s -** i was second leg and got the baton right as the another team got the baton, I was able to open up the gap by about 30-70m away from 2nd place!

Todays practice was pretty sucky we just did 4 200's (then lifted) at about 80% pace and I just felt very.. ""heavy"" from yesterdays meet but it being 80% and i didn't have my spikes on it doesn't phase me.

I know my 200m time is AT LEAST 23s probably low 22s or even high 21s my coach thinks I will hit 49s by the end of the season, what do you guys think so far with my progress?

Also we had done a few practice 4x1 relays and fun 4x2 relays having me race the fastest guy on our team and I would get the baton later then him, and gain up on him! My coach has made comments I finally run with the stride of a sprinter and I feel as if my top speed has gotten higher as well.

**Injury question that has been bugging me:** My right achilles heel has been bothering me since friday, I had no practice so I went to Disney and walked the whole day with a bad ankle pain towards the end. Saturday I tried to run 3-4 miles and around mile number 3 my achilles really started to hurt so I called it quits and didn't even do strides. Sunday took it off because I didn't wanna mess with it more. Monday (yesterday) was the meet and I just pushed through it and in todays runs it was just a annoying pain as well.

Do I ignore it? What should I do? I heard achilles problems are very big and the pain is at the heel..but a little above it, i am guessing that is the achilles heel correct?

**Also so do people sprint without their spikes and should i buy sprinting spikes?** 

I have this mentality that I can only sprint fast and well with my spikes on, and I really hate when I am not allowed to use my spikes since in XC and distance stuff we always put our spikes on for sprint stuff. Also I have been sprinting using my old distance spikes from last year, will it affect my time at all by getting sprinting spikes? Any you guys recommend? 

**Any advice for running the 400m?**

 I think the toughest part for me is after the 1st 200m. I either run so hard for the first 300m, I just try to maintain posture and carry it home. Or I do not speed up at the 200m mark and have some form of kick at the end, which is better? Run 300m as hard as possible and hang on? Or sit/kick method?

***Thanks for everyone always responding to my questions and whoever enjoys reading my progress!

Back in highschool I was doing the 1 and 2 mile double. The mile was first and I completely blew up. I ran about 15 seconds slower than my pr. I was pretty mad about that but I shook it off because I was seeded 3rd and i thought i stood a chance to win. 

So the 2 mile starts the number 1,2, and I seperated from the pack very quickly. These two were completely dueling it out passing eachother several times in the first mile. Meanwhile i just chilled out behind them without struggling too much.
We hit the one mile mark at 5:10.

I decided to take the lead from here. Within the first lap of the second mile number 2 had dropped off and it was just me and number one. I started to throw in surge after surge through the whole second mile. And after every one it took him a little bit longer to get back to me.

The best part of this race was the size of the crowd. The throwing coach on my team always made of point of forcing everyone to be there to support the two milers. Add that to the fact that it was a home meet and you've got all the parents. On top of that we needed these points to pull of the team win.

So when i finally took the bell everyone was up on their feet. My whole team was going nuts. The guy was right behind me and he still hadn't given up. As we came around the corner to 300m to go he tried to come around the outside of me and i reacted immediately. I sprinted so hard for that last 300 i thought i was going to vomit. I ended up putting him into the ground. I finished with about a 25m lead on him. My second mile came through at 5:08.

I'll never forget the feeling of a home crowd roar underneath the lights. I've raced faster times in college and I won a few others. But that feeling was so special others never compared.

So that's my story. And i would lover to hear other people's biggest moments. Sorry if it was long but I didn't want to miss any details.

I decided to run my first 5k in a decade this morning on a whim.  It was a very hilly course, but extremely uncompetitive.  Uncompetitive as in I won with a 19:36.

Anyway, all I have done for the past two years is some weight training.  Since March I decided to add in some sporadic bike rides (I was a cyclist about 5 years ago).  I only really ran 20 hours since March and threw in some half hour stationary bike rides in the gym with maybe 4h/week cycling outside.

When I was in high school, I ran a 4:45 mile.  I only ran for under a year and even then never trained consistently for more than 3 months.  I got a stress fracture in my hip, gave up for a few years, tried cycling for a few years, gave up, tried weight training, and here I am.  In the back of my head I keep wondering ""what if.""  I want to change that.

If you guys could give me a plan to ease myself into running again, I would be so so very appreciative.  With all of the advice out there about how to do it (10% rule vs. ""10% rule isn't the whole story""... base miles, etc.) I feel so lost.  I ran a season of high school track, but our coach literally only had us run 2 miles a day or so.  Such a joke.  My ultimate goal is to run a 4:44 mile just to show myself I can still do it.

I'm 24 years old, 6'0 150 lb.

My biggest faults are impatience (hence the stress fracture) and a tendency to overdo it (I love endorphins from exercise).

A. Stick to only speed/strength during the track season, and only endurance during the rest of the year, or

B. Add in some endurance training to the track season (how much of an effect will this have on sprint speed, etc?) and do some short interval training and strength during the rest of the year (how much will this effect distance ability?)

I'd love any scientific paper about this sort of thing. 

Also, I just found this subreddit after stalking around for a while, and love it!

**Background:** I'm currently a sophomore in highschool (only about 7 weeks of school left) in my third or so week of track. I've never been on a team or done a sport before and began running June 2011 (c25k). 

Body:
5'6 139 lbs 

My PR'S from time trials we had during practice (first time running both):
2:45 - 800m
6:26 - 1600m/mile

They're average to bad, and I'm ok with how I did as I really pushed myself both times. My goal is to run 5:30 mile by next year, and chop at least 30 seconds from my 800m. My pipe-dreams would be a 4:48 mile end of junior year and a shot at a D2 scholarship (emphasis on pipe-dreams).

I want to improve as much as possible from now to 
Anyway here are my questions:

**1. What's the fastest way for me to improve my mile and 800 time?**

**2. How to improve my willpower/self-discipline when running?**. 

I've realized that my body can take a crapload the problem is after a lap or two of sprinting I want to quit. I'm used to this feeling (especially on continuous runs) and normally fight through it and push myself. 

When I ran the mile and 800 (specifically 800) the feeling came after 2 laps (on the mile) and the 2nd lap of the 800. **I sprinted at the end of both the mile and 800 and realized after a few minutes of rest, realized that I still had fuel in the tank...** I believe this feeling is just something all runners have to fight through, but any advice on it?

**3. Any general training advice?**

A normal track practice consists of 

* Very light 800m warmup 5 mins &amp; stretching
* Continuous runs (Normally about 40, 25, 30, or 35 mins depending on day) 
* Strides, 5 x 200m with jogs in between, or drills
* Abs (twice a weak), stretches and we're done.

about 2hours of practice everyday. Is there anything more I can do? Body weight exercises or anything that can improve my run?

EDIT: thank you all so much for the responses. It might be hard to express online, but they're greatly appreciated.

One more thing on my mind:

I'm considering starting to lift weights (both upper and lower body). Would that negatively affect my running at all?

1370022754.0,0,self.AdvancedRunning,1ff04u,Flexible running plan?,desemus,1,1,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ff04u/flexible_running_plan/,"The short of my problem is I want to work towards speed, but am having trouble committing to a specific race goal. I'd like to find a plan that can fit my scatterbrained attempts at building speed while also keeping my base. 

I finished my second full in March. I made my goal time, was doing 40mpw, but my miles were steady and uninteresting, except for a couple intervals. The race went extremely well - my HR was steady, low, and my splits were even, so I at least trained and tapered well for it. 

Out of marathon training, I'm a couple months in the FIRST program. To say it rekindled my running interest is an understatement. I've been running tempo miles at paces I wouldn't dare run, and have an actual goal with intervals. I'm able to handle their perscribed speeds (which are a bit lower then the VDOTS) without getting too overtrained, and have back off on a week where I ran too fast for my own good. I've have heard from a few folks this plan doesn't work well for my base, and with limited mileage would struggle in fulls. I do like the runs, but do want at least a 4th day of running, even if its a quick recovery / form practice run. 

My goals are getting really divergent and I need some help trying to balance them. I'd like to hammer a a sub20 5k, which I should be very close to, but also a sub 40 10k and eventually a 1:30 half. I also want to try sprinting and going for a fast mile; I've never really pushed a sprint or going all out before, and I'd like to try those without disrupting a training week. 

Another subgoal is to slowly build up to some triathlons. I need to get on a bike or swim twice a week, but am less concerned about PRing those. Maybe my feelings will change as I do those races, but for now all I want is to have enough energy to do a bike or swim each week. 

In terms of a plan, what's a good 'building up' strategy if I'm not committed to a race? My only current commitment is a half in Vegas, but with the people I'm traveling with, I am not looking to PR that run :p

If this is the wrong thread for these questions let me know -- I just see a lot of speed goals and training tidbits in here.

I run cross country and track and I'm in 10th grade. My best event is the 3200 meter run. During my indoor season, in January, I ran 11:00 and after that race, I strained a muscle in my hip. I remember I could barely walk after that race, but I still managed to run a two mile cool down and stretch afterwards. I still could barely walk for a day or two after that race, but the pain eventually went away after a couple of days off and taking pain meds. It would come back every now and then, but never to the point where it affected my running. In February, we went spinning on a bike two days a week. Now we're in the outdoor season, increasing the amount of miles we run per week, and I can't go on one run without some random muscle in my legs hurting like hell. Some days its my ankles, my calfs, and my shins. It started after I bought the Saucony Kinvara 3 (in late February,  early March, I don't remember). When I ran in those shoes, the random pains started to occur on a tempo run. So I thought it was shoes. It was my first time running in minimal shoes like those, (I ran in the Nike Lunarglide 4 before) so I thought they weren't for me. So I went ahead and bought the Nike Structure 18 and the pains are still occurring. Now in the 3200, I can't even run under 11:50 because my legs, buttocks, and quads hurt like hell during the race (this happened today, I ran a disappointing 12:30). During the race, I'm not even that close to being out of breath, but the pain in my legs are holding me back. My coach keeps telling me its my mentality, and I'm overreacting and being dramatic about the pain. Is this because that muscle in hip, and I never took more time off, or because my legs are burnt out and tired? Please I need these questions answered. Thank you.

Course page: http://scottsdalebeattheheat.com/site/amazing-course/

It's 11.22km long (or 6.97178 miles). It's gonna be hot. I've trained for cross country and track out in this heat for nearly 10 years now. 2 months ago, I ran Ragnar Ultra out here (Del Sol) and did very well with my 3 back to back half marathons. I'm used to the heat.

**I want to get fast**

Currently I'm 6'0 and 155lbs. I bicycle at least 6miles a day and have been running about 25+miles per week. I have access to a track, hills, and gyms, along with long flat expanses. *What I need advice on:* Speeeeed! I want to go out and destroy some people. I have a decent base and base mileage is always very easy for me to add on/deal with, etc. I have newer shoes, and am ready to go. 


So, advanced Runnit, what workouts do you have for me that would increase my speed for this ~7mile race? Mile repeats? Hills? Sprints? Please, bring it on.



**Edit** I don't want to ""destroy other people"" so much as I want to go out and do well for myself, challenge myself, maybe snag a cash prize just to prove myself I am capable and inspire others to train hard(er). I apologize for how that came off.

So I've been getting some achilles tendonitis on and off for about a year now, and it's annoying the hell out of me. I've been careful and diligent in listening to my body and recognizing the flareups before they get too serious, but it just seems to go for a few weeks, then come back, cyclically. One of the problems is that I have to stop running, or at least slow down significantly for it to heal. I've tried all sorts of things and I feel like I do everything properly (excellent diet, 8+ hours sleep every night, run with HRM at MAF pace, etc), but I think I'm finally going to just take a final swing at crushing this by resting and doing the Alfredsson protocol of 12 weeks of calf drops. The thing I'm concerned about is losing significant fitness over those twelve weeks (or however long it takes before I can start phasing in running again). 

So I'm considering getting a road bike. The bike would cost about 1300 bucks after getting shoes/pedals/helmet and of course the bike. It would allow me to maintain my aerobic system now, and cross train in the future so that I can train more without as much impact on my joints. What do you guys think? Would you do it?

Or would I be better off just throwing some money at a gym pass?

TLDR: Im injured, thinking about buying a road bike. Is it worth it?


edit: before suggesting a used bike, note that I've looked and can't find much. It seems that all the old dudes have attached sentimental value to their 20-30 year old bikes, and are expecting way more than what they're worth.

Its currently track season for me, I am following a pretty standard cycle of High School seasons. Well after this season there will be the summer break. Over the break I plan on working up to about 90-80 mpw. Now this seems quite daunting to me as I only get up to 50 mpw during the season. I will have enough time to do this as I am a bored and dedicated runner and there won't be much else to do in the German country side.

My questions are:
1. How hard will this really be?
2. How should I work up to 90 before the end of august? I can start the beginning of June.
3. How fast will I be after this?
4. Would a sub 16 goal be attainable?

Take into account the distance-oriented training rather than speed training in track and we think this time could be significantly quicker) is a 4:54, and I want a 4:30 this year, 4:10 as a junior, and sub-4 once I graduate. Are these possible? Should I focus more on speed work, or keep building my base mileage? What should my off season look like?

Training consists of (Monday to Saturday) 6x800m repeats, a 3-5 mile recovery run, 2 mile anaerobic threshold training and 4x200m sprints, 3-5 recovery miles, and a 10+ mile distance run. Off season is 40-50 miles a week. 

PR's are 17:43 in the 5k, 11:36 in the 3200m (ran it once my freshman year), 4:54 in the 1600m, 2:04 in the 800m, 54.4 in the 400m. Mid-distances seem to be my forte.

In my first five weeks of training I've gone from 40 to 55 miles per week and am looking to keep increasing that to mid 60s(most likely).
