(SPOILERS),thinlikenate,68,8,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/misfitstv/comments/13t1wt/for_those_of_you_concerned_with_the_direction_of/,"I know, guys. I know. All of our beloved characters are gone, and that sucks. And it all ended so *horrifically* for each of them. Simon: murdered. Alisha: murdered. Curtis: suicide. Nathan: in jail. All except for Kelly, even though her happy ending took place off screen. (Anyone else think a webisode of Kelly and Seth defusing land mines in Africa is in order?) None of these stories ended in a satisfying way. Now that the Superhoodie time loop story arc of true love is over, and the other original characters' story lines have been wrapped up (somewhat), what is this show even about anymore? Why should we care? Here is a couple reasons why you should still care:

1. Howard Overman. He is still in charge. He created the original cast that we all grew to love, and he can teach us to love these new kids.

2. Remember series one? There was no real direction. No over-arching plot. Just 6 stories about a handful of fuck-ups with super powers. It wasn't until series two when the ""Superhoodie time loop"" arc was established, and then concluded at the end of series three. Now that Kelly is gone, and Curtis has killed himself, we're back at the beginning.  A reintroduction of the show and its new characters. By the end of this series, I think we'll all have grown attached to our new gang, and series 5 will establish a new over-arching plot. 

3. The Storm. It's a great premise. A freak storm that turns your deepest insecurities and defining flaws into superpowers. It's fucking brilliant! The formula for this show has the potential for dozens of interesting characters and unique stories for a long long time. There are rumors of an American spin-off of Misfits where the storm happens to a bunch of different kids in the US. I think that's an awesome idea! (I'd hate to see an awful TV-14 Robert Sheehan impression, anyway)

4. You can't blame the showrunners for the departure of (most) our characters. Robert Sheehan thought he was going to be a huge movie star. He *wanted* to leave Misfits. Now that all of his movies have bombed, maybe he regrets leaving. Lauren Socha was arrested and probably wanted to leave the show as well. Iwan Rheon and Antonia Thomas's stories resolved in a way that made sense, even though it was sad. Curtis's suicide was probably born from the need to get rid of the character to allow room for the new group. In a perfect world, the whole crew would have stayed together, but it didn't work out that way. We have to move on. There ain't no happy endings. It's zombie noir, innit?",,False,self,t5_2s8pg,False,,,True,t3_13t1wt,http://www.reddit.com/r/misfitstv/comments/13t1wt/for_those_of_you_concerned_with_the_direction_of/,

(Spoilers)",ZeUbermensch,59,10,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/misfitstv/comments/19yts6/i_didnt_generally_dislike_season_4_but_one_big/,"Just finished Season 4 and I think from Season 3 to now, the show really lost some of its quality. Jess and Finn are both not really that interesting characters, and with Curtis and Seth the writers kept the (in my opinion) least entertaining heroes from S1-S3 to carry on into the new season. What mostly kept me watching was Rudy, to be honest.
Now what bothered me the most is, that I felt like they really changed the focus from the characters in the first seasons getting to know and exploring their newly gained/traded powers to defend themselves against the constant oncoming shitstorm to Season 4, where everyone is already used to their (pretty weak) powers and they almost never use them. The story mostly rotates around everyones love life and Alex's *""quest for cock""* which got boring quite fast. No one has to deal with the burden of their powers anymore (like Curtis trying to desperately fix the past, or Alisha wanting to have a relationship without being constantly raped).
Finn used his power like 4 times in the entire season and half of those times it didn't do shit. And Jess's power only came to use in the first and last episode. Curtis revived one person and i think 2nd Rudy's appearances also became more rare. Oh yeah, and the ""boss fight"" against the 4 horsemen was incredibly boring. 
I hope the writers see how much more potential there is in the powers, than those romances that end quite predictable. Anyhow they might have to bring in more interesting characters and more crazy twists to really keep me watching through another season.

**tl;dr** The new characters and their powers are boring and they never use them. Story concentrates on uninteresting love stories without big twists instead of the powers.

My reasoning for this is before we met Psycho Rudy, whenever Rudy and Emotional Rudy were joined, Rudy was dominate personality-wise. Rudy gets twinges of insecurity, but it's not dominating like when they're separate. Now when Psycho Rudy returns whenever he Joins with Rudy and Emotional Rudy, he still maintains dominance. 

In addition to Psycho Rudy being dominate when joined with the other two, he also displays 2/3 of the Macdonald Triad (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_triad) which have been correlated with violent tendencies later in life. Emotional Rudy reminds Rudy of the ""neighbors cat"" to which Rudy replies that they ""don't speak about that, ever"". Also Emotional Rudy Reminds Rudy that he was a bed wetter after Rudy goes to the Counselor.

Finally, when we first meet Rudy in 3x01 he is initially uncomfortable with murder, something that Psycho Rudy was all too fond of. Also both Rudy and Emotional Rudy recognized the Ukulele, which implied it was a past hobby that was preformed by the pre-storm Rudy.

1. The Estate:  What is ""The Estate""  is it like a neighborhood, or a region, or a non specific location or something?


2. Is the region where the show is filmed: near South Mere Lake in Thamesmead, really as dismal, destitute, and poor a place as it is portrayed?


3. So are all of the places these people live just giant apartment blocks?  What are they like?  The image of the typical UK house I always have in my head is a [terraced house](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ro8LEH45Xe4/T3hEkiFzVeI/AAAAAAAAA0A/hiNDopB_Kfg/s1600/Terraced_Houses.jpg).  Do people normally not move into these until later in life?  Most of my impression on modern Britain comes from Dr. Who, Top Gear, movies made by Simon Peg and the show Kingdom. 


4. The whole ASBO thing... is it only on weekends?  How many hours per day?  It seems like in the show we almost never see them doing anything other then community service (or the time just before or after it).  I have the impression that all the do every day is the community service.  (obviously Curtis has a job so this can't be true) I mean, they must have normal jobs in addition to the ASBO to afford food and rent and what-not... right?  Are they done with college (university?) by this age?

You could tell that it affected the group and they had to seriously think about what to do in order to keep from getting in trouble.

But this season people are literally being killed left and right and it's just become this nonchalant thing. It's as if cops and detectives don't exist in their world (except for the fact that they actually did exist in season 1 when the friend of the 2nd probation worker tried to resolve the death of the 1st probation worker).

I get that they're trying to make a ""joke"" of all the killings, but it's really making for a lackluster season for me. If death isn't serious in a show, then what the hell is? Misfits is supposed to be a drama more than a comedy and if you can just kill people off left and right without any real consequences coming from it, it just doesn't seem to matter who dies anymore as long as the main cast stays alive.

- Timeline B: Nazi-occupied timeline

So we saw that the old man (from timeline A) went back in time to kill Hitler but failed, and ended up going to timeline B. He still had his memories and was the same guy from timeline A.

Timeline B Kelly gets his powers and also goes back in time, then comes back to timeline A, but for some reason she's now turned into timeline A Kelly? What happened there? She should still be timeline B Kelly with all of her Nazi-occupied memories, not timeline A Kelly. We know she ends up being timeline A Kelly because she ""just wants to be a fookin' rocket scientist"" and timeline B Kelly was never a rocket scientist.

Is this a huge plot hole or am I missing something? The only logical explanation I can think of is that timeline A old man actually DID turn into timeline B old man (meaning that no matter what timeline you're in, your memories merge). But this would then mean that Kelly has two completely separate memories from her two lives (since technically, timeline A Kelly is now originally from timeline B), which I highly doubt they're going to stick with in the show.

Essentially, if things were to make sense, the current Kelly should not have any recollection of what's happened in timeline A because she didn't go through those events.

1. **Curtis' Death** - Incidentally, I am a big fan of this episode. I loved the build up (Lola appearing prior), the execution and the consequences so this particular problem is simply me being nit-picky. Personally, when Curtis placed the gun to his temple I would have liked a quick flashback clip of him winning a race or spending some time with Nikki. It would have just added more depth to the scene. Other than that, brilliant. 

2. **No Finn/Jess Love Story** - I loved the characters, but I felt Finn could have done with less pining after Jess and more bantering with Rudy. Couldn't he have just been awkward with the ladies as early episodes seem to indicate? Why did we need a romantic subplot there? 

3. **No Alex** - Got to say, this character ruined the latter half of Series 4 for me. The penis story was horrid and the character was either a total bore or a complete arse hole. Definetely could have done without. 

4. **Abby** - Now, this character had potential but felt flat somewhat, at least in my view. By the end of the series I was okay with her but before she felt really forced, unnecessary and pretty poorly acted. I always cringe at that part in the seventh episode when she snaps 'I don't know who I am!' Poorly delivered. 

5. **More Reference to the old gang** - Yeah, I know shows should move on but this series felt like a completely different show after Curtis was gone. I feel like the writers at this point should have begun using recurring villians (like Lucy the shape shifter or Tim) just as a little bit of a callback. Either that or Finn and Rudy could have found one of Nathan's belongings seeing as they all lived in the community centre at some point. 

6. **Seth** - Not much to go on this, but I wish they would have kept the character around a bit longer. He was fucking cool.

In the series, when a character travels in time, he/she always keeps the same memories he/she had before the time traveling... for example: when Curtis goes back in time to make sure a bad thing does not happen, he still remembers the bad event afterwards because he lived it. But in the Hitler episode, the character who saved the situation is the Kelly from the parallel universe, the Kelly who lived her whole life with the Nazis... Does that mean that she does not remember the events from season 1 and 2?  

I find this really hard to understand.

tl;dr: Is the Kelly who saved the world from the Nazis the same Kelly from the beginning of Misfits, or the Kelly from a parallel universe?",,False,self,t5_2s8pg,False,,,True,t3_xgr2y,http://www.reddit.com/r/misfitstv/comments/xgr2y/question_about_episode_4_season_3_spoiler/,

First I barely know any of the new people. Secondly It became more of a drama then a sci-fi as the lack of powers was disappointing. Finally in my opinion nothing really interesting happened after Curtis.They could of fixed most of this by actually trying to do some character development.The most I saw was Finn and his Father episode and the three Rudy episode but nether of those really developed the characters I still don't know why Finn got telekinesis or Jess gets to see through the wall. I know why Simon could go Invisible or Curtis could turn back time. What I am really hoping for next season what I hope they do is use Abby's memory loss for some actual character development like with Curtis episode in season 1 it is what I am hoping for in season 5.  ,,False,self,t5_2s8pg,False,,,True,t3_15co6y,http://www.reddit.com/r/misfitstv/comments/15co6y/season_4_possible_spoilers/,

This Tuesday October 11th, the bfi are previewing the first episode of Misfits S3. The screening will be followed by a panel and Q&amp;A with members of the cast and crew.

&gt;We are pleased to announce that joining us for the discussion and Q&amp;A will be Howard Overman (creator and lead writer) and cast members Joseph Gilgun, Iwan Rheon, Lauren Socha and Nathan Stewart-Jarrett. The host will be broadcaster Matt Edmondson.

I bought two tickets and then my friend decided he didn't want to go (muppet). So I decided this was a job for reddit!

The screening starts at 6.20 at the bfi Southbank and the tickets are back row centre. If you'd like my spare ticket, just tell me what ironic superpower the Universe would give you and why. I'll let the winner know by 6.30pm Monday 10th October.

Good luck!

Recap: Curtis is bitten by one of the zombies that he resurrected to find out about Lola and in the end kills himself. 
The ending of this episode broke my heart.  It's the 4th season and Simon went back in time/is dead, Alisha is dead, and Kelly is in Africa never to return.  Rudy was the new guy who had no friends until he met them. One by one they drop like flies until him and Curtis are left from the ""original"" (seasons 1-3) arc. I really love the actor's portrayal of Rudy's character.  Rudy is rude, crude, tattooed, and a sexual deviant but we see more of his human side as he realizes what his only living or present friend must do to save them from an apocalypse. Rudy doesn't cry in front of his new friends because he realizes that they will need a ""leader"" since Curtis is now dead and he was obviously the more level-headed and strong one. Rudy knows what must be done but he's still heartbroken, but not completely broken. I loved this, the writers did a good job and this part for me redeemed season 4 and has given me more hope for the show.  The torch from the original characters has been passed down and Rudy must take care of the others.

[Season 2-3 spoilers],,2,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/misfitstv/comments/1346rn/possible_solution_to_the_simon_situation_season/,"I just watched the season 3 finale (been on a marathon since I just discovered the show a couple days ago) and the one thing that really stuck out to me was the 'ASBO 5' footage. By order of episodes, Future Simon dies before the lactokinesis timeline ever occurs. 

They never show him giving up the power to see into the future, nor the power to travel back in time. I expect he can still see into the future, since he was able to be there as Superhoodie when Alisha falls down the stairs and again when Nathan almost died from the car explosion. He didn't know of the first event, and hadn't witnessed the second one (if memory serves me). Because of this, he sees the future that Curtis erased where the milk man murders everybody. So, he knows it must be prevented. This means he would have allowed the video game guy to kill Nathan and believe he was the undercover cop since Nathan was immortal and it would cause the video game guy to continue on to the 'next level' without chasing and killing Alisha. That means the milk guy timeline would have proceeded as normal, giving him the news footage, and then he could travel back in time with the news footage. After that, he would have continued into the timeline we see in the show, letting Alisha run off and get chased by video game guy, then jumping down to take the bullet for her.

The main thing is, he only needs to have access to that news footage just once. Once he has the footage, he could easily leave it somewhere or carry it with him on his phone. Obviously his time travel doesn't affect anything physically with him, since he still has the money and clothes when he travels back at the finale of season 3. 

And even if he somehow doesn't have the foresight power after traveling back, he would have still been aware of the events of the alternate lactokinesis timeline because Curtis would have told him what happens.

The backstory to Jess was the most interesting thing though, and her dialogue with Alex raises questions about what's wrong with him.

She watched the show a month or two ago so she wasn't up for a big complicated in depth discussion on every episode. That's why I've turned to you.

1) I have a problem with the time travel that occurs in the episode with the lactokinetic guy. So Curtis goes back in time and prevents them from ever revealing their powers. I'll buy that Alisha just retold Simon about his future self. No problem. However, I do not understand why ""Future-Simon"" would have a copy of the interview that happened outside the community center when they revealed their powers. Technically that future never happened, and therefore no video should have existed. Nor should Simon remember it.

2) Just a quick theory. What if Simon buys immortality from the superpower-dealer? That way he can technically ""die"" in Alisha's arms, which will still push her towards his past self, but that won't be the official death of Simon's character. I can imagine Alisha being a little peeved when she finds out that Simon knew all along he was going to ""fake"" his own death.

Do these actors HATE this show? The first two seasons were great, why did they all leave? I found this show maybe a week and a half ago and now I'm on season 4 episode 6 and I'm not sure if I even want to watch the last 3 episodes...

The interesting powers stuff is gone. The characters I know are all gone. I give no shits about the new characters except Rudy. I don't care if the bar guy is gay. What the heck...

This reminds me of Firefly. The first season was amazing. Then it was just gone. I guess that's better than the show turning to garbage like misfits did for me in season 4. Kind of bummed out

That was one 

helluva anticlimactic episode. There was so much wrong this season; I don't even know where to start. Let's talk 

about their powers. The previous seasons were about these delinquents ending up with some powers and how 

they cope with it and the shenanigans they get in for abusing their powers. It was so much more entertaining 

and you get to see into the characters. Unlike now where the new cast just happen to run into random people 

with powers and random shit happens and they don't even use their powers (like the stupid killer rabbit episode). 

It just feels so much more shallow and the new characters are unlikable to me.
 

     Then there was the reason for their powers. I loved how the in original cast, each person had a power 

because of their personalities. Simon felt invisible and has invisibility, Alisha was a slut and was able to turn 

people into horndogs, Curtis has a deep regret about fucking up his life so he has the power to rewind time, Kelly 

was conscious of what everyone around her thought of her so she could read minds, and last but not least 

Nathan was I'm not sure, but he was awesome. I don't know what the new cast power has anything to do with 

them.
 

     Another thing wrong with the last episode was Rudy and Nadine. Was it just me or did the relationship felt 

incredibly forced? They met for what? 5 minutes? at a funeral? and they fall deeply in love? (If only it was that 

easy). Then Rudy just goes on and on about Nadine after that. It just didn't seem right.
 

    Then there was the four horsemen OF THE APOCALYPSE. It looked like four kids on a bmx bike with swords. It 

felt like their whole existence, was to create a terrible cliffhanger for Alex which is a rehash of an old plot from 

the previous season. They could have done so much more with that, but they ended up so forgettable. 


     The best episode this season was Curtis episode and it felt kind of like the show died along with him. It 

was sad, but he had to go. He seemed so out of place with the new cast and seriously how long has he been in 

community service? And I also like the new probation worker, because he is just so HARDCORE. Well that's the 

end of my rant. I miss Nathan, Curtis, Alisha, Simon, and Kelly :(, but I understand it changes sometimes for the 

better or worse. I'll watch season 5 to see if they can do anything interesting like the beginning.

So i think the storm gave people what they want most in the world. Like with Nathan: He thought he was perfect and he wanted to be perfect forever-Immortality. Simon didnt want to be noticed by anybody or seen-Invisibility. Curtis wanted to fix his mistakes in the past-Ability to rewind time. Kelly wanted to know what people really, actually thought about her-Mind reading. Alisha wanted to be desired by everyone-Everyone wants her when they touch her. 
 But i also think each power has an ironic twist. Like Nathan dies for a short while and he has to remember the pain and dying and he has to watch the people he loves die. Curtis cant control his time power and i happens randomly. Kellys mind reading made her hear things she didnt want to hear. Alisha keeps almost getting raped because people want her too bad.

I mean they lost the main character, but the writing and plot itself went from witty, funny, fast passed to boring, melo-dramatic, and just what you would expect of an american show on the CBS network. I'm still watching because I have hope with a new cast for season 4 the show can rise back to what it was in the first two seasons: Real people, who stumbled into powers... not 7th heaven with boobsies and foul language.

However, I feel like I've really been let down. First of all,  to make Rudy a relative carbon copy of Nathan was a big mistake. All it does is serve as a constant reminder that Nathan's not there. I was really hoping they would turn him into a super hard-ass/bad-ass to sort of rival Simon, who was turning out to be the real hero of the group.

The past episode in particular, though, felt like someone owned that writer a favor and he just wrote the silly episode he always wanted to write about Curtis. I love Curtis as a character, but I felt like this was very out of character for him (he has always been the ""stud"", and now all of a sudden it turns out he's not good in bed? No, doesn't fit.).

I'm ready to hear about what Simon is doing. He had SUCH potential at the end of Season 2. Two episodes of what is essentially filler is very disappointing to me. The writing of this episode was predictable and boring.

Curtis- He wanted to turn back time to before the drug dealing so he could compete in athletics again.

Kelly- She had self-esteem issues and wanted to know what everyone was thinking about her.

Alisha- She was a slut. Self-explanatory.

Simon- He wanted people to not see him because he didn't want to be made fun of.

Nathan- Haven't actually thought of a reason for his, maybe he was just selfish and wanted to live forever, or he was afraid of death.

Tony- C'mon. If you were working with those kids you'd want to kill them too. Plus he had anger issues before the storm.

Jeremy (The guy that lives with Nathan's mom)- He said he had a dog when he was a kid, maybe that has something to do with it.

Ruth- ""I just wanted to be young again""

Lactokinesis guy- It made his job a whole lot easier.

Mother Theresa chick- She wanted to help people and benefit the world.

Seth- ""I wanted to be the top dealer."" He was a drug dealer before the storm and he wanted to be the best around, so he was given the power to deal powers.

Rudy- He felt lonely in the world and wanted someone that he could talk to to be with him constantly.
