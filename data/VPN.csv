My problem:

* Purchased a NordVPN subscription last month.
* Couldn't connect for the majority of the time.
* When I did connect, connection disconnected regularly.
* Other VPN services I used remained stable and unaffected.

Attempted resolution:

* Emailed NordVPN several times with the problem and requested a refund (after only 24 hours).
* They responded, saying I should try to resolve the issue.
* I asked again for a refund. No response.
* I warned them several times I was going to issue a chargeback as I haven't been able to use the service at all.
* No response still.

Their terms and conditions **used to** state:

”If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, within 120 days from the purchase date, we will fully refund the cost of your order.”

They have since removed that from [the page](http://www.nordvpn.com/terms-of-service/).

#I've since raised a chargeback and hope they get stung with hefty fees.

**TL;DR** NordVPN support ignore me. I pay for non-working service. No refund. They sneakily modify their ToS.

We do not track any user activity in our system. We simply provide the gateways for you to be able to connect to those gateways. However, if we receive complaints which violate or Terms Of Service **we do have the ability to determine who was at fault.""**

then i asked: 

-since you do not maintain any logs of browsing or anything how can that information you are talking about be of use to anyone? (and he never told me what kind of info and/or logs they keep, at least that's what sounded to me, that they actually log your stuff in some way.""

and he replies:
- "" We would look at the seriousness of what the complaint was and evaluate whether **we would release any or all information**. It would really depend on the situation.""

and then i asked again how in the world if it's supposed to be anonymous and kept no logs they could give away any info, if supposedly they do not have any at all and he said:

-"" No information would ever just be released. I am not sure how they actually determine how they track down customers who violate the TOS. For security reasons that information is not relayed to Tier 1 Support.""


so, i was thinking... they do maybe keep some sort of logs.

and, i was wondering since the guy i was talking to couldn't really answer the question, how could they identify who at their network is at fault?

Encryption strength is something that many get wrong, and people fall into the trap of buying the ""highest encryption grade"" VPNs from providers who claim to offer - guess what? - the highest encryption grade. If a landing page is telling you something, then it must be true. Right? ...not!  

  How can you, as a non-tech savvy customer, verify that a provider's claim is true regarding encryption strength?   

First of all you should know how OpenVPN works. It is based on a client-server connection and the client configuration has to match the server configuration, otherwise you won't be able to establish the connection.   

Basically, an OpenVPN server won't provide you 256-bit encryption if the client is not configured to use 256-bit encryption. So you can check the .ovpn files from the VPN provider and see if there's something like ""cipher AES-256-CBC"" and/or ""keysize 256"" in the file.  Refer to [OpenVPN documentation](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/manuals/65-openvpn-20x-manpage.html) for more info on config options. 

If the cipher is not specified, then OpenVPN will use the default cipher which is BF 128 (Blowfish, 128-bit keysize). Another thing you can do is to check the connection log file, because it will tell you what encryption cipher it is using. Depending on provider, you may need to add a ""verb 3 [to 5]"" line in the .ovpn config file to see that.   

There is absolutely nothing wrong with BF 128-bit like being insecure - it's only a matter of claims &amp; deceiving customers into buying something that's different from reality. I don't know about you, but I for one don't like 1. liars or 2. those who don't know how their product works. 

This being said, I am starting the ""Name &amp; Shame series"" with TorGuard VPN which is advertising 256-bit encryption.

*  Here is a sample TorGuard [.ovpn config file](http://pastebin.com/nYfRhEF8) 
*  Here is a [connection log](http://i.imgur.com/7udYZ4q.png) in verbose mode  

and finally, here is a [live chat log](http://pastebin.com/h78LTiKJ) with their support rep. You can draw the conclusions yourself

I switched from Hidemyass.com a few months ago to PIA. I'll admit, I was a bit skeptical at first, but took the plunge.

I had constant Issues with Hidemyass.com; from DMCA notices to account closures on a weekly basis. Apparently my credit card and physical address were blacklisted by their system as I tried to renew my subscription WHILE I was behind their VPN service, which made it almost impossible to pay for the service. Customer Service was bellow average, ranging anywhere from 24-48 hours to reply to an e-mail with a generic response. Torrenting while behind the VPN was just atrocious. Hidemyass.com would monitor my online activity like hounds, and send me requests to delete certain types of files I had downloaded from my computer threatening to cancel my service. I felt safer not having the VPN service connected at all, and dealing with my ISP was immensely more pleasurable.

Ever since I switched to PIA, I've had my client connected 24/7. Torrenting has yet to be an Issue, and keep in mind that I'm usually seeding while I'm asleep as well. No threats of cancelling my service due to DCMA notices, no e-mails, I'm pretty much left alone. Not to mention the numerous payments methods available. A few weeks ago I was experiencing slow download speeds through my Bittorrent client due to something on my end; regardless, a PIA Customer Service Representative helped me trouble shoot the problem even though it had nothing to do with their VPN client. They also helped me configure the Bittorrent client so I got the best performance while connected to their VPN service. As I'm on a Mac, the Customer Service Representative booted up a Mac and told me exactly where to look and what to change. If this isn't phenomenal customer service, I don't know what is. I actually feel safe connecting to PIA, and leaving myself connected isn't a concern. Offering the client on multiple platforms, and ACTUALLY keeping them updated is a huge plus.

What really concerns me is that I had an active subscription to BTGuard VPN service, and yet I still am reading this email. The letter supplied my local IP address as the origination site of the uploaded files, which the university was able to trace back to me. I'm generally very careful about ensuring that the VPN is turned on when torrenting, and I've configured my system to automatically connect upon startup or standby resume. The only time that I disconnect from the VPN is when I'm hosting my minecraft server, but the server log shows that I wasn't playing on the same date of the torrent timestamp given in the DMCA warning. I've performed no additional configuration steps to the VPN besides what was given to me on the installation page at BTGuard. Was this a case of user error or bad configuration settings?

I'm relatively new at using VPNs (apparently), and I'm pretty bummed that I had a breach like this. What options are out there to prevent this from happening in the future?

I am new to VPN in general, but I am learning quickly.  I am currently using Private Internet Access as my VPN, using their client.  My main question is, is their client using OpenVPN?  I downloaded the installer straight from PIA.  What service is the client running on?

From what I can tell, PPTP sucks (hacked easily), IPSEC can be a pain to use, and OpenVPN is the way to go.  

Also, is there an easy way to disconnect from the VPN easily?  Sometimes I need to disconnect completely.  Whenever I disconnect or close the client all together I can't connect to the internet due to DNS not being able to be resolved.

* CIA and NSA's charters are **foreign** (non US) intelligence, so they could easily setup honeypots in any country.  Just look at past instances of US agencies working with/in other countries [1].  And yes of course CIA/NSA work domestically too, but the point is foreign is what they're best at.  And if you find a way to stay away from US agencies' honeypots, don't think other governments don't do the same thing [2].
* 99% of you (reddit) are just pirating shit or watching fucked up porn, dont pretend you're some james bond that anyone actually cares about.  If there really even are honeypot VPNs they would never affect any normal person.  They'd be kept so secret that they'd only use intelligence from it for osama bin laden type cases.  Honeypot VPNs would be kept at a much higher level of secrecy than that of mass snooping of email/phones which means with a honeypot VPN you're still better off than using nothing.
* If you are some international spy/terrorist, I hope you don't think a VPN will actually help you.  You should be using vpn-&gt;tor-&gt;vpn from a homeless guy's cell phone that you stole off him.
* If you really care about trying to determine what VPNs might be honeypots, think about how you would set up a honeypot VPN to catch bad people.  What would the site look like?  What country would you set it up in so that people will trust you the most? In what way would you advertise it to attract bad people? [3]

###What is a VPN?

VPN is an acronym for [Virtual Private Network] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network). 

A VPN is a network technology that creates a secure network connection over a public network such as the Internet or a private network owned by a service provider. Large corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies use VPN technology to enable remote users to securely connect to a private network.

A VPN can connect multiple sites over a large distance just like a Wide Area Network (WAN). VPNs are often used to extend intranets worldwide to disseminate information and news to a wide user base. Educational institutions use VPNs to connect campuses that can be distributed across the country or around the world.

In order to gain access to the private network, a user must be authenticated using a unique identification and a password. An authentication token is often used to gain access to a private network through a personal identification number (PIN) that a user must enter. 

VPN in the way we mean and use it is not that much different to the described way. We join a virtual private network from a VPN provider and get a not public routed IP and can access the internet through NAT (like adding default gateway to the VPN one). And for securing our connection they also do not log anything (&lt;- that's not standard, but should be with a good provider)

###Whats the difference between surfing the web anonymously and Torrenting anonymously?

You can only anonymously download torrents with a VPN service. You can surf the web anonymously with a [Proxy service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) or with a VPN service.

###I see a lot of ""Free VPN Services"" is this possible or are they just scamming me.

Many people agree ""If you're not paying for it, then you are the product."" Hosting a VPN service can be very expensive and any VPN service that offers free service has to pay their bills some how. A free VPN service is not recommended.

###What does the six strike thing mean?

The Center for Copyright Information (CCI), the US organization tasked with developing a workable system for ""punishing infringement of copyright"" on the web, has explained how the six strikes program for US internet users will work. More Information can be found in [this article](http://sg.news.yahoo.com/six-strikes-explained-us-readies-piracy-warning-system-145127585.html)

###Recommended VPN Services Providers

* Private Internet Access VPN - $39.95/yr - (https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/)
* Astrill - $69.95/yr - (https://www.astrill.com/)
* Witopia - $69.99/yr - (https://www.witopia.net/)
* Boleh VPN - $85.90/yr - (http://www.bolehvpn.net/)
* IVPN - $100.00/yr - (http://www.ivpn.net/)
* Mullvad 5€/month
* Perfect-Privacy 150€/yr
* VPNTunnel 5€/month

###There are a lot of companies out there offering VPN services. What are the top 3 most trusted, user-friendly vpns? Will it run on windows, linux and mac?

Not that easy to answer, since everyone will have other personal preferences

###What is the best balance of quality with monthly cost?

Personally I would say 5-10€ are fine

###What are the top 3 most trusted, user-friendly mobile vpns? Will it run on android, windows, blackberry and iOS?

... 

###Should I always run my VPN? Even when gaming or shopping online?

For gaming, no, it will increase your latency (ping) too much, and isn't really needed.  The only times it could help would be when you log into the game with username/password, or if the game has an online/in-game store you're buying from with a real credit card.  You should verify that communications with the login screen and store are encrypted (as they should be and probably are on every major online game) before using it.

For shopping - if the shopping site uses https:// for every page, or at least the payment pages, then it is already encrypted for those pages.  Anyone listening in will only be able to see what site you are shopping at, but the not the contents of your communications with it.  If you want to eliminate the possibility of eavesdroppers or men-in-the-middle seeing even what store you are shopping at then you should use a VPN.

Private Internet Access
TWC RoadRunner

VPNs are a great tool for hiding your internet traffic, but all too often the VPN connection can drop without warning, potentially exposing your traffic to the world before you notice and take action.  Some VPN clients operate with ""kill switch"" modes, but these seem to have mixed results, and have been known to leak some amount of traffic through when reconnecting.  Personally I would rather put my trust in a piece of networking hardware than a route table modifying application running on my computer itself.

My solution was to set up my wireless AP to broadcast two SSIDs at once, both running to my home internet line.  I use PrivateInternetAccess, which publishes their list of VPN IP addresses [here](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/forum/index.php?p=/discussion/5/gigabit-vpn-gateway-list/p1).

One of the SSIDs runs my typical home network, which I have set to allow all traffic through like normal.  On the other SSID I put in a few firewall commands that allow traffic to a handful of subnets that correspond to the VPN gateway IP address ranges of the servers in my chosen region, and then deny all other traffic.

For example, using the VPN Gateway IP list for the East option in the PIA link above, you could use these commands:

1.  Allow   108.61.0.0/16
2.  Allow   66.55.141.0/24
3.  Allow   66.237.37.0/24
4.  Deny    All

You could rachet it in even tighter by specifically allowing each individual IP, but I'm a bit too lazy for that.

This is the ""VPN only"" SSID, and it will not function at all unless you have the VPN up and running, since the only sites it can access are the VPN gateways.  If the VPN drops for any reason, all traffic passing through my AP is dropped as well.  The SSID doesn't go down though, so my computer stays connected to it and continues to try to pass traffic to it with zero success.

My AP can run multiple SSIDs and apply policies to each which made this easy, but this solution could also be accomplished by daisy chaining any two APs (most people have an old one lying around, right?) and setting the firewall commands on the furthest box from the wall.  The one closer to the wall is your normal wifi (non-vpn traffic, guests, printer, xbox, netflix streaming dvd player, etc).",,False,,t5_2qxhk,False,,,True,t3_19d3ui,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/19d3ui/vpn_tip_preventing_accidental_exposed_traffic_via/,

I also wanted to keep an app (plex or uTorrent perhaps) connected only when the vpn was connected and shutdown the app if the vpn connection got dropped.

I wrote a script for that last night and I've put it here for you do download and use - https://www.box.com/s/b990kv3vlwckwva1lrr8

--------------------------

* It will work if your vpn provider lets you connect through Windows' VPN PPTP setup (example: https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#windows7_pptp) 

There is a readme.txt file that explains how it works. Enter your vpn settings in settings.cmd.

* Run startvpn.cmd to connect to vpn and stopvpn.cmd to disconnect.

* startvpn.cmd will start a long running loop that runs every 120 seconds (editable). If VPN is currently connected, it will run the app. If not, it will cleanly shutdown the app. The idea is that the app should be running only when the VPN is connected. It will repeatedly try connecting to the vpn. If connected, it will run the app if it isn't already running.

* stopvpn.cmd sets up the params so the script will disconnect vpn, close the app and close the loop started by startvpn.cmd.

The script is all text - no exe/compiled code or anything so you can observe the code to see what's in there. 

(ofcourse, script provided as is without any warranty - use at your own risk. I won't be liable for anything that goes wrong with it).

------------------------------------------------

Firstly, most of this is if not directly illegal then probably against each sites terms of use and you could in theory get your account blocked and face some heat. However, I find it to be extremely unlikely but of course, do this on your own risk.


-------------------------------------------

**NHL:** NHL Gamecenter Live is the name of the service, and it costs $50 this season. It doesn't look like they have a Playoff only package. In the US you can watch out of market games, and in other countries your access depends on who has the television rights. Right now you can't sign up from a US address, due to all games in the playoffs being blacked out. Accessing from Germany works fine. Once purchased the games available depend on your IP, meaning you in most cases have to use a VPN to view a game. 

**NBA:** NBA League Pass. It's quite simple, access from Spain and purchase the Playoff package for **$13**. Only blacked out in Canada and Spain (and US for the playoffs), meaning you can most likely just view from your home IP.

**NFL:** 2013 pricing hasn't been released yet, but if previous years are any indication NFL Game Pass will have a different price in different countries. I believe it was even free in the Netherlands last year!

**MLB:** MLB.tv costs either $130 or $110 per season, and also has a monthly payment plan. There are no blackouts outside the US and Canada, and to be best of my knowledge the price is universal around the world.

**Premier League:** Abu Dhabi sport seems to be the best choice, it's cheap but requires a IP from the middle east (I recommend Egypt). For list of countries you can use click [here](www.en.bpl.admcsport.com), that link is also where you sign up when you have the IP. English commentary.

**La Liga/Serie A/Ligue 1/UEFA Champions League/UEFA Europa League:** Al Jazeera Sport seems to be the best choice, same IP restrictions as Abu Dhabi. It's cheap and has english commentary. [Link](http://www.en.aljazeerasport.tv/)

**Bundesliga:** I have no idea.

**Formula 1:** Abu Dhabi sport, same as BPL.

**Tennis:** Al Jazeera Sport has the rights to the US and French Open and a couple [more](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera_Sports#Tennis)

**MLS:** MLS has it's own service named MLS Live. Only works within the US, Canada or Mexico. Cost is $60 per season and has normal blackout games. However with some IP juggling between the US, Canada and Mexico most games are available to watch.

----------------------------------------------

That is at least most of major sports that I follow, if you're wondering about a sport let me know and I'll see what I can find. Some sports are harder to view online than others, for example if you want to view NASCAR online you have to spend $35 a month on a swedish website (but you also get NHL, Premier League and some more).

Since SSH is encrypted, all communication between your browser and the AWS server is encrypted and secure.  Of course, the server is associated with your Amazon account, and I don't know if Amazon logs traffic through temporary servers or not (probably).

I currently use HMA to circumvent regional restrictions for Netflix et. al. and that's been working out perfectly fine for me.  I switch it on when I need to ""look American"" and otherwise rarely use it.  I tend to be very ""wired in"" in the sense that I use all sorts of cloud-based services between my various devices and I use social media extensively for work.  For the most part I have no problem with leaving an online footprint with my day-to-day web-browsing and actively like some of the targeted ads I receive from places like Google.  

That all being said, all of these privacy scares in the media and tech blogs lately have gotten me a little more concerned about being able to be somewhat anonymous when I want to be.  For instance, I've recently started playing around with XBMC and though I typically like to purchase my media legitimately, I'm a little miffed that I can't use my iTunes purchases on it (outside of music) and their don't seem to be any services that allow me to buy movies and TV shows DRM-free.  As such, I thought I'd complement that with some torrenting but I'm super paranoid despite the fact that I live in Canada where that isn't *quite* as much of an issue (though likely will be in the nearish future).

I've gone ahead and set up a Crunchbang install through virtual box and it is running fine through my current HMA VPN (I load the VPN, start the VM, and it connects automatically through NAT) and showing the VPN's IP rather than my own.  I've also run all the recommended tests on the sidebar and everything is coming up the way it should be.  I've even got Tor running on top of that for general browsing when I want to remain anonymous.  Because I'm feeling particularly paranoid, however, I've decided to purchase a 1-year subscription to PIA given that HMA has a poor reputation for handing over user-data and PIA seems to be the general recommendation for that.  Given that I've still got about six months left of my HMA subscription I thought I might even try to chain them together for extra redundancy.  

ANYWAY ... a lot of people seem to recommend purchasing your subscription through bitcoins or other anonymous currencies but that seems like a fair bit of work for someone who just wants to download the occasional torrent off a public tracker or browse with some degree of anonymity when I want to.  Given these circumstances, is it really that necessary to set up a bitcoin account just for this?

**tl;dr**
Will I be shooting myself in the foot buying a PIA subscription with my credit card if I'll only be using it for public torrent trackers and the occasional private browsing within my virtual machine, or am I being overly paranoid?  I'm not sharing government secrets, downloading or distributing anything that should put me on a gov't watch list, or anything messed up like that - I just want to be able to torrent in some degree of peace.  Summary:

-I live in Canada

-Anything ""sensitive"" will occur inside of a VM under a user account with a fake persona and where I will not be logging into anything that could tie it to my real life.  What happens in the VM stays in the VM (aside from dumping media to my media server).

-My regular browsing and day-to-day activity will still take place on my regular (non-VM) Windows install.
-I already use HMA but am concerned about their reputation in this regard.


Thanks!

1374348867.0,14,self.VPN,1ipklq,Is VPNBook a honeypot?,,17,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/1ipklq/is_vpnbook_a_honeypot/,"Many of us may know of or use a free VPN service called VPNBook based in Romania. It offers mind blowing speeds, unlimited bandwidth, and claims to delete connection logs after 7 days. Too good to be true, right?

I became suspicious so I decided to do a bit of research on this service. I first saw it pop up on TorrentFreak comments from accounts that had no previous comment history. There were also numerous [forum](http://www.hackcommunity.com/Thread-VPNBook-Free-Unlimited-Fast-and-no-Logging) [posts](http://theanimelounge.com/threads/us-six-strikes-to-go-live-in-a-month-setting-up-a-vpn.17785/) discussing the possibilities of a honeypot, but no serious allegations emerged. 

Next, I saw Web Archive records for their domain and saw something really suspicious. As their current [privacy policy](http://www.vpnbook.com/contact) stands, they only collect IP addresses and connection time which are supposedly deleted after a week. [This capture](http://web.archive.org/web/20121023140920/http://www.vpnbook.com/) from October 2012 shows their old privacy policy at the very bottom of the page. Two parts from that policy caught my attention: ""We are not required by law to hand any information over **unless by court-order**"" and ""Connection logs are automatically deleted every **3 days**"". These two parts are not in their most current policy. If they were required to hand over data per a court order in 2012, why would they not be in 2013? Also, why did their connection log policy change so drastically?

The most discriminating evidence against VPNBook is [this Google+ post](https://plus.google.com/117604887745850959716/posts/J8tkLw1Fgjv) from hacktivist group Anonymous. In it, they claim that logs from VPNBook have been used to incriminate their members in a federal investigation. 

VPNBook doesn't maintain much of a public presence except for their website, Facebook, and Twitter accounts. Their website shows signs of conflicting language and policy changes and they didn't answer my concerns through their contact form. To anyone using this service or considering using it, stay far away from it. It is true that there aren't any proven allegations against VPNBook. They may quite possibly be legit but all evidence says otherwise. In general, it is better to pay for VPN services to ensure security and privacy.

They say they don't keep logs of any activity, yet, I was reading one of the posts here in this subreddit that mentioned PrivatVPN is compliant to requests for their information (regarding copyright). 

Taken from PrivatVPN.se/en/
1.) We don’t keep ANY logs that allow us or a 3rd party to match an IP address and a time stamp to a user our service. The only thing we log are e-mails and user names but it’s not possible to bind a activity on the Internet to a user. This applies to all our servers except our U.S. servers.
[Note: We’re logging IP addresses and time stamp on the incoming connection for our U.S. servers. We offer no anonymity on our U.S. servers.]

2.) We operate in Swedish jurisdiction. Since we do not log any IP addresses we have nothing to disclose. Circumstances doesn’t matter in this case, we have no information regarding our customers’ IP addresses and activity on the Internet. Therefore we have no information to share with any 3rd party.

^ So after that I have a couple questions I was hoping someone might be able to answer for me.

- If there are no logs kept, how is one (the vpn) able to be compliant to a request for information?
&amp;
- Because *I am located* in the U.S. (my ISP is in America), does that mean logs are being kept of my traffic even though I am connected to a server in Sweden? Or would information logging only occur if I were connected to a PrivatVPN server that was on United States soil? 

I'm a novice when it comes to this type of thing, but I'm doing my best to learn :D I'd really appreciate it, though, if someone would help me understand this more clearly because I'd hate to do something foolish like torrent and be logged while doing so.

I had thought that my laptop from home would appear as though it were in the same domain as my computer in the office at the university and so have access to the journal sites.  

Am I expecting too much from the VPN or have I left something out?  Or do I need something completely different (proxy?).

Details
---------------------
The server is on a Ubuntu machine.  

I have two clients at home on my Windows 7 machine; OpenVPN GUI and Securepoint SSL VPN.  I only run one at a time and when I do I right click and run as administrator.

Both clients claim success at establishing connections.

However:

1. The General IP address test (http://www.xmyip.com/) shows my IP address as the one provided by my home's internet provider.  The proxy, ISP and hostname all pertain to them as well.  Which probably accounts for the fact that:

2. I am unable to access scientific journals.  When I go to a journal's website, the university is not recognized (usually there is some notice at the top of a journal's website that access is being provided by the university) and when I try to download a .pdf it redirects to a page asking for payment.

Edit: Solution (short)
---------------------
interfect was right, I needed to set up the client to route all the traffic through the VPN as outlined by his [link to OpenVPN's documentation](http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html#redirect). As clear as these directions are, I had trouble getting my mind around the fact that in order to set up the **client** you make changes to the **server's configuration**. This is in fact what you need to do. The server **pushes** configuration instructions out to the client. Also it took far too long for me to accept that the iptable MASQUERADE command can be run even if iptables are not being used for anything else, as is in the case of Ubuntu which defaults to having no firewall.

I'm still a bit new at VPN, but I was reading and came across the concept of DNS Leaks which could potentially expose me to my ISP.  I am using a program from Private Internet Access to connect to the VPN, which has a setting called DNS Leak Protection which I have enabled.  My network settings are configured to use OpenDNS.  I noticed that when I have my VPN turned off and I go to DNSLeakTest.com it shows only 1 DNS server, the OpenVPN.  However, when I connect to the VPN and run the test I show three different DNS servers

8.0.18.43
8.0.18.204

2. Secondly I hear a lot of people say that you shouldn't use a vpn for torrenting and for personal use (logging into online accounts). Why is this? Surely they can't track data back to you from the exit node? Plus from that node there must be 100's of people connecting. Does that mean to be private and to torrent one must use 2 vpns?

You, like me, may have found a ton of headaches getting openvpn working. First, you definitely want to enable EPEL by following the guidelines here:

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL/FAQ#How_can_I_install_the_packages_from_the_EPEL_software_repository.3F

(Basically, you install an RPM from the browser, easy.)

Then, you want to ``sudo yum install openvpn NetworkManager-openvpn`` so that you can edit your VPN config in network manager.

For me, I had to reboot after each thing because somehow it wasn't pushing these automatically. Not necessarily after _this_ step, but most of them. Like, importing a config file, it wouldn't let me save due to permissions, and after rebooting it was there and I could type and save my password.

Anyway, after this you need to download your zip file, _most_ of the instructions from PIA are good here, they're the [Ubuntu OpenVPN instructions](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#ubuntu_openvpn). However, instead of creating a VPN, when adding at the bottom hit ""Import an existing configuration"". From that zip file you downloaded from PIA (link titled 'OpenVPN Configuration Files'), find the server you want. For example, CA - Toronto.ovpn.  If you get an error, reboot and try it again. I don't know a faster way.

Everything's preset except your username and password. Type this in and hit apply. You may be able to connect now by going to the network manager dropdown, going to VPN, and picking the one named the same as the one you just saved. If it just loops forever and times out, try rebooting. After that, you should _definitely_ get asked for the password again, and have the option to save it to your keychain.  You want to do this.

When this is all done, go to http://ddg.gg and search 'ip'. If the result isn't your IP but one in another land, you win!

It also creates a wireless network and has place for 4 Ethernet cables. Then we have another router which we are not really using right now which is a Linksys WRT54GL (let’s call it Router2). 

Recently we got a PIA account for a month in order to test it, but we would really like all four computers to share the VPN connection.  Our first idea (we are programmers and we know our way around UNIX, but networking is not exactly our strength, so forgive us if our idea seems incredibly crazy, stupid or naive) was to keep using the Router1 to access the internet and flash Router2 with Tomato or DD-WRT so it could get an internet connection form Router1, while acting as an OpenVPN client and routing the VPN connection to the other computers over wireless and cable. The idea is, that you could connect to Router2 if you want to use the VPN or to Router1 if you want the normal connection (for whatever reason). 

Now after reading some post here I got the idea that the encryption might be a bit too much for the WRT54GL’s 200 MHz processor and could become the bottleneck for this reason, so I thought: well I have an old desktop doing nothing (Core 2, 2 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive) and a USB Ethernet adapter, so maybe I can put that computer between the two routers and let it handle the VPN connection, so I don’t have to worry about not having enough processing power for the encryption. So we proceeded and installed pfSense on the machine and plugged it in. 

Now long story short, it has been a lot of fun playing with the machine but we have not been able to get it to work as we want. My flat mate now decided to install FreeBSD instead (pfSense has no man pages and the Web Interface was giving us trouble) and is now compiling curl or whatever, but I really get the feeling we are quite disoriented here. 

So I guess the concrete questions would be:

* Is this configuration a good idea at all (taking into account that we really don’t want to buy any new equipment)? And if not, why?  
 
* How would you achieve this kind of configuration (be it in Linux, FreeBSD, pfSense or whatever) or whatever configuration you think would feat our needs?

Oh, and this may not be the place to ask, but anonymity wise what's the difference between bitcoins and prepaid debit cards?  It seems like the cards are easier to get ahold of, so what is the advantage of purchasing with bitcoins?

(plus, is PPTP useless now?)",literallyallah,10,1,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/1izdz8/what_are_the_advantages_of_using_a_full_vpn/,"My apologies in advance for the length. The TL;DR is pretty much the title



Unlike most users of this sub, I'm not talking about privacy VPNs that tunnel through a provider to prevent government etc. snooping, eg. PIA, I'm talking about using a VPN to tunnel back to my home network, to prevent local network snooping, and to help me access services behind my firewall

When I'm on a public connection, or anywhere not at home, I'll often use SSH and SOCKS5 tunnelling  so all my traffic is proxied through my home server. I've been using this since SSH is extremely easy to set up, and I'd be running it even if it didn't support tunnelling

The only disadvantage is that global VPN support is built into most OSes, desktop and mobile (On Android, there is a free app called simply 'SSH Tunnel' which can proxy all traffic (providing you have root), so this is not a problem for me), and the fact that it's easier to make your computers behave as though they are on the same network, whereas SSH tunnelling isn't a 'real' VPN in the same way

I know OpenVPN has the advantage of native support in DD-WRT etc., as both a client an a server, but I'm only tunnelling a single device, not everything on my network (if I was on my network, I wouldn't be tunnelling), and I'm fine using my Raspberry Pi as a server (if I really wanted to, it's possible to use DD-WRT as both a WAN SSH server and a global SSH proxy with IPTABLES)

What would I gain from using a full VPN like OpenVPN? It seems [really hard to set up](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenVPN) in comparison to the 2 commands needed to install and start an SSH server

I've heard PPTP is easy to set up, but I've also heard its encryption is about as secure as WEP (not very) if it has any at all(?), while SSH encryption is pretty secure AFAIK, and I don't have to use keys, just passwords (though keys are more secure, I know). Is this true?

PS: In case I was unclear: **I'm not talking about whether I should be using a 'hosted' VPN for privacy** (eg. PIA), I just want to know what the **technical advantages** of the **software** would be if I switched to a **self hosted** VPN instead of simple SSH tunnels

----

**TL;DR:** I'm fine using SSH tunnels. Should I not be?

----

appendix (stop reading here unless you want to do the same):

For anyone wanting to do the same, the command is

    ssh -CD &lt;local port&gt; [-p &lt;SSH server port&gt;] [-N] &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;

C is compression

D &lt;local port&gt; is the port to bind to on your local machine. Use a port&gt;1000 so you don't need root.

p is only needed if your server doesn't run on TCP 22

N means no shell will be started. I personally don't bother, as it's easy to see when it's connected and I often need to run remote commands

Now tell all your apps to use SOCKS5 proxy 127.0.0.1:&lt;local port&gt;. Some apps may leak DNS requests. Firefox requires about:config changes (though Foxyproxy will do that for you), or you can use Privoxy

If your connection hangs, in the SSH window, enter &lt;enter&gt;~.&lt;enter&gt; to kill it 

If you're good with IPTABLES, you can probably automatically send all traffic through the tunnel (except the tunnel connection itself, or you'll have an interesting 'Yo dawg' situation), but in that case, you don't need my help",,False,,t5_2qxhk,1374702382.0,,,True,t3_1izdz8,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/1izdz8/what_are_the_advantages_of_using_a_full_vpn/,

I've been using PIA happily for about a month, with no issues.  After enabling FileVault (mac os encryption) on my home directory, the PIA stopped connecting.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the application with no success.  I've contacted PIA support, which has been prompt to reply, but has unfortunately not provided me with any solution yet.  They've had me adjust / try many different settings in the advanced tab of the application.

It is my belief that the FileVault encryption process somehow corrupted the PIA app and any hidden / latent config files for the VPN.  Has anyone ever run into this problem, or can anyone think of why this would occur?

I'm still waiting on more correspondence from PIA,  but I thought this was a unique problem and reddit might have some ideas.

On a side note - I've been happy with PIA here in the U.S.  The speeds are decent and the price is right.  Also their support has gotten back to me quickly with this problem, which I can't say for other VPNs.


**EDIT : ** PIA Supports last suggestion was to disable filevault as a solution.  I disabled the Filevault encryption and magically the PIA connects with no problems.  So, something about the PIA app doesn't like working within an encrypted image.  I'd prefer the encryption (as most of us do I assume).

- Let's say I'm connected to PIA and am online on facebook while torrenting something fishy. Can't anybody (e.g. us government) just see my ip on facebook, then see the same ip on the torrent and therefore conclude that it was exactly me that was downloading something illegal? (Via my facebook account)?

- Anything that's not encrypted (ssh for example) can be fully read by PIA, right?

- Are there any other things to watch out for when using their service? Is there a way to exactly configure which programs use the vpn and which ones don't? (linux)

- I also want to use it on my android phone. I suppose that PIA would here also be able to see everything I do as long as it's not encrypted? (e.g. read my mails when I'm fetching them?)

- Lets say I'm connected via PIA but at the same time logged in when doing a google search. (Now this is a legal question): In case I search for something illegal, would that be legally backtraceable via my google account or would this connection not be allowed from a legal standpoint (as it was actually not an ip from the country where I'm located) so it ""couldn't have been me"" but rather somebody that hacked into my account from the us?

- As long as I'm connected using openvpn (gnome network manager) EVERYTHING is encrypted, not just my browser, right? So I can use bittorrent without problems?

- Concerning regulations: Let's say I'm in country A. PIA is a us based company. Is there any difference in security between choosing a vpn server in my own country (A) in another country (B) or in the US (C) or are they all the same?

My current setup is that I have a main PC running torrents for the latest linux distros and I have that same PC sharing home made videos to the rest of my household via streaming devices (roku, etc).  My router is a DD-WRT router.

My goal was to use the VPN only when I'm torrenting, since I wouldn't need it otherwise, but I tried that and found that I couldn't connect to my main PC from the Roku at that time.

Here's my question: Is it better to put PIA VPN on my router and have it go 24/7? - or - Should I only run my torrent program at specific times and have a VPN kill switch running if needed, and disable the VPN when I'm not torrenting?  Also, I saw that I can run a program that if it detects that I'm no longer on the VPN IP, it'll disable any program, such as the torrent program.

1350604489.0,9,self.VPN,11pwa5,[F] [-L] VPNBook. Automated connection with python script,Tard_Hunter,11,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/11pwa5/f_l_vpnbook_automated_connection_with_python/,"**EDIT 4**: Python script no longer needed. If you'd like to start and connect automatically just create a task scheduler to start the OpenVPN GUI with the parameter ""*--connect*"" to startup at login.

""C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\bin\openvpn-gui-1.0.3.exe"" **--connect vpnbook.ovpn**

In the config file ensure you have ""*auth-user-pass LoginConfig.txt*"" with a text file named LoginConfig.txt in the same directory as the config file containing:

**freeopenvpn
J8hfCiu6W**

And that should work. 


So I made a post about this [website](http://www.vpnbook.com) which allows both PPTP and a free OpenVPN account to be used. After discussions in the [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/115lb5/vpnbook_free_vpn_service_also_python_script_for/) I decided to use the OpenVPN service instead of PPTP and to automate the login as they change their password routinely anywhere between 24 - 48 hours.

**PLEASE NOTE I INSTALLED OPENVPN CLIENT USING THE DEFAULT DIRECTORY WHICH IS C:\Program Files\OpenVPN**
**If THIS IS DIFFERENT THEN YOU'LL NEED TO MODIFY THE TUTORIAL ACCORDINGLY**

 The resulting python script is this:

    import urllib
    import sys
    import os

    f = urllib.urlopen(""http://www.vpnbook.com"")

    b = f.read()

    f.close()

    def find_between( s, first, last ):
        try:
            start = s.index( first ) + len( first )
            end = s.index( last, start )
            return s[start:end]
        except ValueError:
            return """"

    password_dirty = find_between(b, ""freeopenvpn&lt;/strong&gt;"", ""&lt;/strong&gt;"")

    password = password_dirty[35:44]

    f = open(""C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\password.txt"", ""w"")

    f.write(""freeopenvpn\n"" + password)

    f.close()

    os.system( '""C:\\Program Files\\OpenVPN\\bin\\openvpn-gui-1.0.3.exe"" --connect vpnbook.ovpn' )

This python code will go off and grab the current password from their website, store that password in a text file in the directory C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config\password.txt, we aren't worried about any encryption as it changes etc. It then launches the OpenVPN gui at the directory shown above and will auto connect using the modified config file that we'll get to in a moment.

To set up VPNBook with OpenVPN you'll want to grab the [OpenVPN client](http://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-2.2.2-install.exe)(assuming windows here) if you haven't done so already then you'll want the certificates from VPNBook's Website, ~~Files for lazy~~ **Check edit below**. In that zip file will be the certificate that needs installing and the config file we need to edit and move to *C:\Program Files\OpenVPN\config*. Open this config file up in notepad and modify the following:

*auth-user-pass* **-&gt;** *auth-user-pass password.txt*

This will look for the username and password in the file password.txt located in the config directory.

Now all that is left is to do is create a schedule to run the python script every hour or so to ensure the connection is always correct when it changes. Also having it run at start-up wouldn't be a bad idea either.

Any question just post.

Cheers. Adam.

**EDIT**: I have just noticed they have changed their certificate files for two different port numbers. One being [UDP port 81](http://www.vpnbook.com/free-openvpn-account/vpnbook-udp81.zip) and the other being [TCP port 443](http://www.vpnbook.com/free-openvpn-account/vpnbook-tcp443.zip).


&gt;You should use TCP 443 profile (harder to block by firewall) if you cannot connect via UDP.


**EDIT 2**: I have now re written the script and it's working with the TCP package although the UDP package is throwing a wobble, I think it's their configuration as it mentions dev tun requiring more commands in the config file. The new script is available here:
[Python 2.7.3 Version](http://pastebin.com/E2JNttc5)
[Python 3.3.0 Version](http://pastebin.com/vv8w6Z0P)

Mild editing will be needed, for example 32 bit machines need to change the directories (all explained in the script files)

**EDIT 3**: I have noticed a possible typo in the UDP config file. I have changed:
    dev tun
to:
    dev tun1
as this is what the TCP config contains and it works beautifully, although I have noticed a change of speed? Anybody else notice anything similar?

As my country in Europe is about to pass some annoying anti-piracy laws, hitting our privacy hard, I intend to invest in a VPN connection.

- I am a Netflix customer in my country, but our library of TV series/movies is very limited compared to the US. I've read about Chrome extensions like Media Hint, that can give you access to the US' Netflix library. My question in this regard is: Let's say I, though a VPN connection, get an IP address based in e. g. Sweden. Will I then be able to use Media Hint, and my IP address would point to Sweden in all my traffic (torrenting, etc.), while I could still use the US Netflix library?

(With this question, I assume that having a VNP that provides a US IP address is not a good idea, as the US laws are working hard against piracy, and a lot of US citizens (a lot in this subreddit, probably) are acquiring VPN services to get an IP address *somewhere else* than the US?)",,False,,t5_2qxhk,False,,,True,t3_1dr8zj,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/1dr8zj/vpnnetflix/,

I've started using Private Internet Access on my HTPC for my torrenting needs. In order to maintain remote web access to the system from outside my network, I only use the SOCKS5 proxy provided by PIA instead of the full blown VPN. 

I have started noticing that the proxy support by many of the popular torrent clients all have issues. I would like to start experimenting with using the full VPN, but I need to be able to remotely access the machine from a web interface, not via TeamViewer. 

The only thing I could come up with to get this set up would be to run a small virtual machine on the HTPC that would relay traffic.

So my home router would forward ports to the virtual machine, which would then relays traffic to the HTPC itself. Since the HTPC only sees the virtual machine as being on the local network, I wouldn't expect it to try to send the traffic through the VPN. 

Do you think this would work? Is there a simpler way to use a VPN service but still be able to access the machine's web interface(s) from any remote client? (Smart Phone, Office PC, Library PC, etc.)

EDIT: So, I thought I'd see what would happen if I actually tried this. Much to my surprise, after enabling the VPN, myipaddress.com and checkmytorrentip.com report my HTPC's public IP address to be one of PIA's gateways. The interesting part is that I'm still able to access my HTPC's web interface using my router's public IP address and forwarded ports as usual. How can that be? tracert's show my traffic routing via the VPN, but yet I'm still able to communicate with the machine via my router's IP address. I wasn't expecting that to work, and I'm a little confused/scared as to why it DOES work.",,False,,t5_2qxhk,1362672321.0,,,True,t3_19ufro,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/19ufro/remote_access_from_outside_vpn/,

So recently I have been looking for a VPN service that would best suit my needs...

* Access to geo-blocked sites (Netflix, Hulu, etc.)

* Providing the most privacy possible ( no logging, well encrypted traffic)

* Allow's P2P (Don't use it too often but still want it to be allowed)

I have been looking at some services already but I'm not sure which one is actually good so I am also looking for some opinions from people who have **actually** used the service. 

* Private Internet Access (looked good but I'm curious as to how they are able to find accounts that abuse their service without storing any logs) 

* Bolehvpn

* Airvpn 

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated,

I am thinking about purchasing a VPN service in order to watch US Netflix/hulu from the UK. But before I do I had a few questions.

If I used a service like PIA, can I select which country I am connected to?

1374072472.0,6,self.VPN,1ihl28,Can't get openVPN to boot with Raspbmc...,russ_b,6,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/1ihl28/cant_get_openvpn_to_boot_with_raspbmc/,"I'm putting together a Raspbmc rig for my mother in law to use as a media centre. I have it up and running with openVPN so she can access my home server. It works perfectly, but OpenVPN refuses to auto-start. 

I've done various testing using my Linux Mint 15 rig and can get it to autoboot no problem, but an identical approach on Raspbmc doesn't work.

Here's what I've done:


I have my keys, .crt's and my .conf file in /etc/openvpn


myvpn.conf looks like this:


* remote &lt;replaced my IP with this&gt; 1194
* client
* dev tun
* proto udp
* resolv-retry infinite
* nobind
* persist-key
* persist-tun
* ca /etc/openvpn/ca-cert.crt
* cert /etc/openvpn/&lt;replaced with this&gt;Client.crt
* key /etc/openvpn/&lt;replaced with this&gt;Client.key
* comp-lzo
* verb 3
* auth-user-pass


I've appeded to /etc/rc.local with this:


* cd /etc/openvpn ; 
* sudo ./autosignon &amp;
* exit 0


and autosignon looks like this (and I've installed 'expect'):


    #!/usr/bin/expect -f
    set force_conservative 0
    if {$force_conservative} {
        set send_slow {1 .1}
        proc send {ignore arg} {
                sleep .1
                exp_send -s -- $arg
        }
    }

    set timeout -1
    spawn openvpn --config /etc/openvpn/myvpn.conf
    match_max 100000
    expect -exact ""Enter Auth Username:""
    send -- "",replaced with this&gt;\r""
    expect -exact ""Enter Auth Password:""
    send -- ""&lt;replaced with this&gt;\r""
    expect eof



I've run the autosignon script and it starts openvpn no problem, though interestingly, you have to go into the Raspbian settings and 'update now' to get it to recognise and use the VPN IP once I run the script. I've tried simply updating the network after boot, but it doesn't change. 


I've also Chmod'd autosignon and rc.local. I've tried using 'sudo' to kick off the scripts and I've also tried putting all of this into root and re-assigning the paths there (as one forum recommended). No luck - it just wont start at boot time. 


Finally, I've also tried Upstart, but I'm not at all familiar with it and haven't the faintest idea how to get that going (I've tried other peoples openVPN Upstart scripts, but to no avail).


Like I've said, I've tested all of this on another PC and it all works fine at boot time and the autosignon script definitely works when I manually start it.

Anyone got any ideas? It's been a few days of research and testing now and I'm reaching the end of my tether!

I was wondering if someone could help me with a routing problem I am having...

My setup is as follows:

Headless Ubuntu server + OpenVPN. Running 'sudo service openvpn start' establishes a connection PIA. Upon connection, I create a cron job that sets up port forwarding, updates qBittorrent's config file and launches qBittorrent client.

By default, PIA pushes their route configuration that forces all traffic to go through their servers. While it is good in some cases, I cannot access any of my own websites (unless I'm on a local network). So, for that reason, I have disabled their routes by adding the following line to the PIA's config file:

    route-noexec

After doing that, I can access my websites externally, but my torrent client is pointing to my WAN IP (given by my ISP) instead of PIA.

Could someone please help me configure routing on my box that will:

 - route all requests for port X via PIA tunnel
 - route everything else via my ISP

Thank you very much for your help!

I will try to be go so much in detail that I can so this post might be long, if you miss any data in the post please say so and I'll provide more info.

I am currently trying to configure a Cisco 3725 to act as a Easy VPN server. When my company starts a project with a customer, we create a VRF and have them on a separate LAN in our Project Area Network. To allow the customer access to that network we send a preconfigured ASA to the customer to setup a IPSec L2L tunnel between their office network and ""their"" network at our Project Area.

This setup is somewhat insecure since there are really no restrictions setup on the users connecting to our Project Area Network. Now I want to see if I can make this connection better, using Easy VPN.

The plan is to make a Cisco 3725 to act as a Easy VPN server, and have clients from the customer connect with the help of Cisco VPN Client software. 

I have made a topology of this scenario in GNS3 ([HERE IS THE TOPOLOGY](http://i.imgur.com/3ndJeqY.jpg)), the router named *R2_3725* is the Easy VPN Server, router *R3_2691* is where the VPN Client (Cloud named *Host* in the topology) is connected to. The VPN Client *Host* (172.30.2.10/24) want to access *vPC2* inside our Project Area Network, VRF lan20, VLAN 20, IP 10.100.20.10/24.

**Problem:**

I manage to get up the tunnel between the VPN Client *Host* and the Easy VPN Server *R2_3725*, but I am not able to ping *vPC2*.

[Full configuration on R2_3725](http://textuploader.com/?p=6&amp;id=ufr5M). As you can see, there are **NO NAT configuration what so ever**.

When I issue *sh crypto isakmp sa*:

The relevant routes are the quad-zero, 172.20.1.0 (assigned to the host from the local pool on R2_3725), 172.30.2.0 (the subnet VPN Client host is placed in) and 192.168.200.2 (outside interface of R2_3725).

Shouldn't I have a route to the 10.100.20.0/24 network with a gateway 172.20.1.1? Saying that if I want to go to that network, it should go through the tunnel? From the VPN Client, I can't even ping that gateway (172.20.1.1).

If I look at the **VPN Client Statistics** [this is the result](http://i.imgur.com/8lUoWh4.jpg).

I can add that the parts I feel insecure about in the configuration is the split-tunnel ACL, the ip local pool and the IP unnumbered-command.

Basically I am far from amazing when it comes to software knowledge, and just want to check I have the right ideas. I have tried searching for some answers but I thought I'd ask here.

(p.s some of these are stupid questions sorry)

1. Does your computer access the internet via the VPN? computer&gt;VPN&gt;Internet? 

2. Can you turn the server off or access the internet via another way, or are you locked in for the whole subscription.

3. What can the internet provider see from their point of view.

4. I only pirate a few albums here and there, would you still recommend a VPN - I'm from Australia looking at ibvpn or proXPN at the moment.

5. Is there any down sides to running a VPN


Sorry if I seem paranoid, I just don't really know what I'm doing, and don't want to get trapped into something. All I want is to pirate a few albums and some software such as Vray, maybe some deepweb stuff. Other than that I just use my computer for work (modeling/rendering) and some gaming here and there, occasionally some online purchases.

I live in a dorm with very strict internet regulation and because of that all the native iOS VPN options won't work for me. (for example: on my laptop I had to switch to TCP instead of UDP and had to use port 443. I'm not able to set this up in the native iOS options).


Thats why I installed OpenVPN and used it with HideMyAss which worked good. Today my subscription ended and I moved to PIA. 

The problem with PIA in combination with OpenVPN on iOS seems to be that PIA uses a different system for their .crt somehow. Thats why I get the error: ""No certificates are present in the Keychain"".

After some googling I found a thread in the OpenVPN forums (https://forums.openvpn.net/topic12133.html) in which was stated:
""It seems that the app explicitly asks for a ""client.key"" and ""client.crt"". Otherwise it just gives the notification that no certificates are present""

I'm not that tech savvy and don't know what to do now. Anybody here able and willing to help?

I looked at the difference of the HideMyAss and PrivateInternetAccess configs and copied the missing &lt;cert&gt; and &lt;key&gt; part of HMI to the config of PrivateInternetAccess. I then imported it and the error disappeared.

Help!,blenderben,6,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/19yina/some_sites_not_loading_and_dns_leakage_with_pia/,"So as with a lot of people recently, I picked up a one month subscription to privateinternetaccess.  Also known as PIA.

However, I am running into a problem and I am wondering if some more experienced users here could tell me what is going on and maybe what I need to do.

I am currently using the PIA VPN with Windows 7 64bit and Chrome.

I have set up my VPN connection to PIA via their PPTP steps:
https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/client-support/#windows7_pptp
I honestly don't want to 'install' anything just to gain VPN access when VPN connections are a built-in function to all operating systems.

Once I establish a connection to the VPN successfully, certain websites don't load.  Namely www.dnsleaktest.com doesn't even load properly.  Funny that I can't test for DNS leaks when I am connected to the VPN.  It just hangs and says ""waiting for code.jquery.com"" and then some random crap from Google.  This isn't the only case.  Facebook has a bit of an issue as well, and so do a number of other sites.

If I break the VPN connection, everything goes back to normal, everything is peachy and it loads up in an instant.  What is going on here??  Do I have a DNS leak?  Are my connections conflicting or getting split?

I've tried to manually clear the DNS, by following the manual Solution B listed here: http://www.dnsleaktest.com/how-to-fix-a-dns-leak.php
And it still has not worked either.

I've also tried changing the DNS servers to 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220.   Also tried Google's public DNS: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4

Nothing has worked and I still have MANY pages that don't load properly.

For the most part, yeah I could continue to use DNS this way knowning that I am protected, but here is the kicker.  I connect to the SAME VPN address and credentials, using my Mac Mini running Mac OS X 10.8.2 and it works WONDERFULLY.  ALL sites load in a snap.  www.dnsleaktest.com loads super fast and I pass the leak test 100% of the time with ISP listing as all from xxxx.Level3.xxxx (which is PIA) and everything else loads.

What the heck is going on here?

Do I HAVE to use PIA's little installer tool?  I had a friend use that, and he said every time he disconnected, it would kill his underlying internet connection as well.

EDIT: So I forced 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 as my DNS for the VPN connection and now I am finally able to load and run dnsleaktest.com (granted it is super duper slow).  I am getting the following for my hostname: m11.lax.opendns.com

For my PC, I'm looking at IPSec or a similar connection on OpenVPN.  I could run a torrent client through a proxy if need be, but I'm mainly concerned with speed, stability, and my own paranoia over privacy.  I also run PeerBlock and occasionally use I2P for browsing.

So my question is ~~three-fold~~ two-fold:

* Am I going about this correctly, or should I be looking at another way to set this up?
* ~~What's the best router to get around $50? (I run two or three simultaneous high-bandwidth connections at the most)~~
* Do I need to terminate the router's tunnel within the U.S. in order to use streaming services, Xbox Live, iTunes, etc.?  (My PC's tunnel would still terminate overseas)

So, do I really needed the encryption to keep from getting DCMA notices? As long as I have the proxy set up correctly I should be OK right? 

Do I have to worry about DNS leaks with the proxy?


How many devices can I use with my subscription? I have a couple other computers I would like to be able to use with my subscription if the need arose, do I need a separate subscription for each or do I have a certain amount of devices I can use with my account?

I know with using the VPN client that there is a chance it could disconnect and my my real IP could leak, is there any chance of that with the proxy?

Is there a reason for me to run the VPN client if all I am doing is downloading torrents? I understand the VPN client offers encryption but is there any way they can figure out its me downloading the torrents if I just use the SOCKS5 proxy?

I've seen some people say not to use one of the US VPN connections, is there any reason for this or is it just extra security/paranoia?

Is there any reason for me to use the VPN client if all I'm doing is downloading torrents?

Thank you in advance, I'm sorry to post again but I had a few questions that I needed answered badly before I started torrenting heavily.

* Good wireless support needed for router/firmware

I am trying to find a way to configure the Windows 7 firewall to allow only VPN traffic and under no circumstances leak my normal connection through should the VPN server drop. My setup is an Openvpn server on private VPS, connected to on my end via router (Tomato).

Prior to switching from Openvpn GUI to the router client, I was able to differentiate ""private"" and ""public"" networks for the two connections (normal and VPN) and use this differentiation to parse out which programs could use which network via the Windows 7 firewall. However, now that I have switched to using a router to handle the openvpn client, windows no longer differentiates between the two connections. Regardless of the VPN client running or not running in router settings, windows identifies the network as the same, thus removing my ability to use my previous firewall method.

Is there another way I would either a) be able to differentiate these two networks in windows or b) configure the Windows 7 firewall in a different manner to allow only VPN traffic through at all times?

I have a small target market who can't access online games, steam, torrents, etc. This won't earn me much money but the customers are definitely there and it would help people out.

I intend on renting a VPS and allow people to connect through this and it needs to be on port 80. Trying to find information on setting this up.

1) Is there anything 'premade' which is fairly easy to configure to get this going?

2) Windows or Linux? I assume linux but I have limited linux experience

3) Are there any premade 'template' applications I can preconfigure, they can login and it will do the rest?

4) How do some services automatically create new VPN accounts upon the payment on a website?

I've got the bandwidth.  (It's all in silicon valley, which effects latency, and also legal juristiction.)    - I'm sitting on 11 gigabits of burst capacity, and using like 200Mbps.  (now, my commit is only three gigabits, but my overage rate is /very reasonable/)

I think I want to give you a public IP address.   Idea being, you can sit behind whatever funky nat device you use to connect to the internet, and tunnel through to my VPN, and you then have a public IP you can run servers on or whatever if you want.   (I mean, I don't expect you to run a major service on your comcast line, it would suck because your comcast line sucks.  But I won't be charging you major money, either.)     

A dynamic address (or nat) service is also possible for outgoing-only, of course,  with more logging effort.    Disallowing incoming connections does solve some abuse issues (e.g. you can't run a landing page for a phishing site, something I disconnect my current customers for, if you don't have incoming connections.)   I can also disallow certain outgoing dest. ports, for instance, I could block port 25, and vastly reduce the service's potential utility as a spam cannon.   (That won't block all spam/abuse, of course, but it will stop most of it.)  

Now, what I want to do is to have a privacy policy that says something to the effect of ""I will allow you to see all the data I keep about you.""   - how much data I keep, and how long, well, I need to do more research as to my legal responsabilities and stuff... but I think that transparency is absolutely key.    I'd have some mechanisim (either sftp authenticated with a key or a web portal with a password or something) that would allow you to download all the logs that have to do with you.

The other thing, though?  is that if you are doing something that is illegal in my jusrisdiction, I don't want you as a customer.  I mean, I don't have a bunch of lawyers sitting around.   (I might be open to partnering with a lawyer, but as-is?  I don't want to deal with it.)  

Now, that said, I have nigh unlimited bandwidth.  I'm pretty happy selling bandwidth at a penny a gigabyte of total transfer; if I don't get complaints.   I'm making money on that.  (and I  have over bought bandwidth to the point where I might be willing to take a loss.)  

First, does this (I'm keeping logs of who was on what IP when, and retaining those logs for a period of time that will be decided later, but before the service goes live)  make me uninteresting to most of you?  Am I speaking to the wrong market here?    I mean, I have considered tackling the SMB market with this; e.g. you can outsource running your office VPNs to me, and I can, you know, throw things like storage devices or your co-located servers on that same VPN, but usually that's a lower volume, high-touch, high margin market, and I tend to do better in the low-touch low-margin markets.  

What I find amusing about the current market is that the vpns that don't give you a static IP, that seem to be focused on privacy, are cheaper than the VPNs that do give you a static IP.    Considering the cost of IPv4 addresses vs. the cost of handling abuse, well, I would price things the other way around.  I wonder if a static IP VPN service that required a year prepay (or something else to discourage spammers from signing up, taking a dump all over my network and leaving) that was priced (and offered the same level of support, e.g., not very much)  as a dynamic IP/nat VPN service would sell well?

Next, if this is interesting to you, I have some questions:   What do you want with regards to logging policy?  Do you have links to legal opinions from trusted folks (like, say the EFF?) on how long one ought to keep the logs, and what you ought to log?   

(I mean, I personally will require logging of who was on what IP when for a certain period of time.  I don't want to be a spam cannon or other abuse problem.) 

To be clear, this is, minimum, months out, and might not happen at all.  I'm just doing market research here.  ",,False,,t5_2qxhk,False,,,True,t3_1a1ygf,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/1a1ygf/for_those_of_you_who_are_doing_things_that_are/,

I want to 

1: Just protect my privacy in daily life. I don't want my isp to know what websites I visit. I don't want these websites to know where I come from. I just don't want anybody to know anything about me when browsing the internet but instead remain as anonymous as possible. (Yes, I know the vpn sees everything that doesn't use ssl).

2: I want all kinds of stuff. Music, Movies, Games. And I want it for free. Without having the swat kick in my front door and ending up like .com did.

I've decided to use PIA since they seem to be just what I was looking for. The problem is the implementation on my side.

The stuff I'm using:

- My desktop pc, which I use everyday for all kinds of normal stuff. Browsing, listening to music, facebook, google, working and what not

- An android phone

- A laptop 

I want to remain anonymous on all 3 devices. Of course I'm not going to use my phone for any kind of downloading. The only privacy I need there is the privacy mentioned in ""1"".

I can use any combination of my desktop pc and my laptop and any number of OSs (Windows, Linux, whatever) in order to achieve my goal.

The problems I see here are the following:

- Am I actually fucked when I'm logged into facebook while torrenting stuff at the same time? Is there any way to avoid this by using different PCs, OSs or whatever?

- Does every device open up it's own tunnel to PIA? Unless I set PIA up as a vpn in my router they should, right? Does that mean that as long as I'm using the laptop exclusively for downloading and do all my logging in stuff on my main pc I remain save?

- Can anybody else than PIA tell that different devices all belong to me/are connected to each other in any way and therefore connect my legal and not so legal activities?

Is there any actual advantage in using my laptop and my desktop pc or does it not make a difference?

Basically the idea is to  list all the factors for choosing a VPN and then use some basic statistics to help select the most secure, the most private services etc.  Obviously I don't have enough money/time to try each one individually. I was making a list of what sort of things were key factors in choosing a service and wanted to run the list by this forum before I got to crunching any numbers. For this project it is assumed that it is a commercial service, so nothing really fancy please.



Variables for Security:
Protocol
Layer
Encryption



Variables for Privacy:
Logging policy, ie do they log at all.
DMCA compliance/BitTorrent friendly?
How much do they log? IE all traffic or just connection times and ip.
Payment method. Do they take paypal or bitcoin for example
User information. Do they need alot of information on you?




Variables for speed
Throughput
Ping
Static Ip or Dynamic?



These were just some thoughts, I will obviously have to trim these lists. The plan is to pick the top 10-20 VPN providers and score them based on these factors, use SPSS/Excel to rank them and then make a list for secure, private, speed and perhaps 'overall' best. Opinions and criticisms welcome.  Once again this is just a mini project, nothing big and providing it turns out well I'll post it here.

What's the best way to do it?

I scoured the FAQ/legalspeak and haven't been able to concisely answer the following (and was hoping current subscribers of PIA could help):

1. If I sign up with my ""real"" email and identifying information (and pay with my real credit card), am I effectively ruining my anonymity by changing the point of traffic identification from my ISP to the VPN provider?  I.e. barring any possible backdoors at PIA will someone that intercepts the encrypted traffic have any way whatsoever of knowing it's attached to MY PIA account even if they don't know what's inside it due to the encryption (assume I'm using OpenVPN) or will they only be able to tell that I'm a user of PIA?  Furthermore, is there any chance that anyone else's illicit activity could result in me getting questioned or in trouble in any way since I simply have an account with identifying information and IPs are shared?

2. Bitinstant is down atm and I don't think that's a completely anonymous way to pay regardless since even if you buy a MoneyPak card and a burner cell there's an extremely low chance you weren't caught on camera.  What do most of you guys use to pay?

3. (This may be in FAQ but I'll ask anyways since it might vary based on various peoples' experiences) Bandwidth-wise what are the limits?  Do they vary based on what server you're connected to?  I'd probably get frustrated with anything below ~10 Mbps given what I'm used to.

4. It's a subscription service (yearly), so if I pick that option I assume they'll rebill me $40 yearly.  Is there a ""cancel subscription"" link online somewhere or do I have to rely on calling/messaging customer service?  If the latter, how responsive are they?

This is a quick question but I'm just looking for some confirmation. 

I'm currently using my VPN service on my phone, and torrent over the wifi. If I switch off my wifi and connect to my Data Plan, can I confirm that all my traffic will be encrypted and my Phone provider wont be able to see I'm torrenting. As it will all be encrypted. 

On a side note I'm using OpenVPN to connect right now. Does anyone know about a Kill switch to turn off the dataplan when the VPN stops. Otherwise i way have to whip something up in tasker.

Typically the poker client software will try to detect if you're connecting through a VPN and shut you down if you do.  I'm running OpenVPN on a DD-WRT router which should keep the poker client from detecting any VPN software, however there is another issue that has gotten other VPN users caught in the past.

Specifically, if the VPN connection has a hiccup, your internet connection can automatically reroute around your VPN and back through your normal ISP connection, giving away your true IP and location (I believe this is what a DNS leak is?).  I've tried to do some research about how to prevent this but I've managed to confuse myself a bit; some sites say it's a problem that is specific to Windows (in which case I wouldn't need to worry about it on a DD-WRT router), while others say that it can happen regardless.  Is there a good way to ensure that my router will simply shut down all traffic if the VPN connection drops?

Also, is it safe to use a daisy-chain setup of two routers to allow devices other than my PC to access the internet directly rather than also using the router?  Something like CABLE -&gt; ROUTER 1 -&gt; ROUTER 2, where router 1 is a standard router that all my other devices connect to, and router 2 is the DD-WRT router I use for the VPN.  Is this safe or should I scrap the middle router and just run everything through the DD-WRT?  Thanks a bunch.

I have done some reading about the different vpns there are, and the different services they all offer. 

However, none of them answer my one question.

I would also like to say that I spoke with a PIA rep.

My college campus uses Cisco NAC as a program to make sure 'bad' people don't use their network. There are also other reasons like keeping viruses off the network. Cisco NAC is installed on your computer, and checks if your antivirus and window updates are on the most recent updates. It also checks if your username/password match what the network has. If it does, then you are able to log in. I don't know if Cisco NAC does anything more than that, but I think it might. 

**First scenario**: NAC is installed on my computer and checks windows updates/user+psw to log me into network. After I log into the network, can I use PIA vpn to hide what I'm doing on the network? (example: log on, turn on PIA, browse facebook - admins don't see me browsing facebook)

**Second scenario**: I uninstall Cisco NAC, and find a way around it. All I have to do is open up my browser and log in to the network. (I do this by following [these](http://www.giocc.com/bypassing-uci-resnets-cisco-nac-appliance-for-windows-users.html) steps. Yes, it works, because I've done it before.) After logging in, will PIA hide what I'm doing from the network admins? 

If something is unclear, I'll try to explain it better.

Hello, I'm trying to get OpenVPN-GUI v4 working. It connects to my VPN fine - the logs / status window seem to show no signs of errors (perhaps I wouldn't notice anyway), the tray Icon is green, and it gives me my assigned IP address always.

It only *seems* to actually start routing my traffic through the VPN once I've completely restarted everything and BEFORE I run any other internet-using application. Only can I tell that it is *apparently* routing through the VPN because I can no longer visit urls / ping urls - pinging IP addresses works fine however, so I thought DNS issue. If I visit the IP address of ipchicken.com, I get a page giving me my same old ISP address.

1. Service provider known to be trusted by the larger online user community
2. Service is fast and just works (VPN'ing into any server)
3. Paid is fine
4. Has both services I need, not just bit torrent anynomizer or not just VPN (something like CyberGhost)

I'm new to VPNs. I signed up with PIA tonight and I'm having trouble at every turn. All I want to do is run BitTorrent (using uTorrent for now) through the VPN while letting other traffic work normally. I need to make sure that the BT client won't connect with my real IP if I forget to connect to the VPN or the VPN goes down.

I tried creating the VPN connection through Windows 7 and setting uTorrent's net.bind_ip/outgoing_ip parameters to the adapter's IP, but I couldn't get port forwarding to work without using PIA's application, which forces all traffic to go through the VPN. I'm also not sure how to tell whether the BT client is actually connecting through the VPN.

PIA has a proxy that I could use, but it doesn't allow port forwarding.

I also tried using PIA's application and setting up rules in a software firewall to block uTorrent if it's not connecting through the VPN adapter. I followed [this guide](http://www.tuvpn.com/en/faqs/block-certain-applications-if-vpn-down) for Comodo. The rules to allow uTorrent through aren't kicking it, and it can't connect at all. I'm already sick of this bloated Comodo firewall, but I couldn't figure out how to apply the instructions to Windows Firewall.

Finally, am I right in thinking that I don't need to worry about DNS leaks if I'm only concerned with BT traffic?

I hope you don't mind yet another six-strikes newbie thread.

""In order for us to block this one individual, we simply implement new firewall rules, effectively blocking the abused protocol for everyone on that VPN server. Since there are no user logs to go by, we handle abuse per server, not per user.""

and 

""Since it’s impossible for us to locate which user on the server is actually responsible for the violation, we block the infringing protocol in its entirety, whatever it may be – Kazaa, HTTP, Jabber, Citrix, Bittorrent, FTP, Gnucleus, eDonkey2000, etc. This ensures the content in violation is immediately removed from that server and no longer active on our network.""

If I am reading this correctly, they will block entire protocols or servers to hinder the actions of a single user.  Has anyone that uses TorGuard experienced this?  If so, how did it effect you and for how long? 

As far as a general question, I am sort of concerned about speeds.  I have read plenty of posts suggesting that most VPN related speeds are 5-10mb/s.

My ISP download speed is ~90-105mb/s so I really don't want to lose all that speed if I can help it.

The second router uses PPTP. When I connect my laptop to it, I am only getting under **10mbps** through Private Internet Access. However, if I use the OpenVPN client on a computer from my first router, I get **30mbps**. Why is it so much slower when I connect using PPTP on the second router?

I just got and set up PIA mostly for torrenting purposes. I enabled the internet kill switch and DNS leak protection in the advanced settings, but I have since been reading that these functions aren't all that great, as when your VPN goes down there is a window of a few seconds in which your IP could potentially be exposed before the client reacts and actually kills your internet.

As a result, I wanted to check out VPNetMon to do this for me as a third-party application but that isn't working with PIA right now, presumably because of the PIA settings I enabled. And now, after disabling the Kill Switch and DNS Protection, I cannot connect to my regular internet connection without having to also be connected to the VPN client. Once I reconnect, though, I am able to surf the web once more. (I should note that once you opt-in for the Kill Switch and DNS Protection you get a pop-up that says by doing so you could cause connectivity issues.)

I'm new to this whole thing and have done tons of research on Google and used the search function on Reddit, but can't find anything related to this topic. Any thoughts?

TL;DR: I can't connect to the internet unless I'm also connected to PIA. Heeeeelp",,False,,t5_2qxhk,False,,,True,t3_15v66v,http://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/15v66v/issue_with_connectivity_after_disconnecting_pia/,

But I'm still having the same issue. So much so I lost interest for a while. But I need to get this up and running again.

Anyways- on to my issue. I've been sold on running my own server for various things, my own personal VPN, my own webmail server (using cPanel) etc. So I obviously made the jump in and have been researching like c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-razy. Now this is 15 days later, and I've only managed to pick the country I'd like my server to be hosted or have an exit node from.

So I've picked Switzerland (as I have friends near there, cyber laws, and other reasons) but I'm having a difficult time finding a VPS server that meets what I'm trying to do.

RAM isn't my primary concern. Speed is. I want a 100mb connection (this is negotiable but I'd like a high amoutn of speed to match my home connection which is 40mbps down,) as well as a price that beats paying for a VPN such as Vypr (I've just heard about PIA and will be routing further traffic from my VPS through to them for an extra layer of annonymity.) Also I wouldn't mind 20gb of storage. I know I'm asking a lot, but I've found plenty of servers in the US and Turkey that meet or beat my expectations but honestly I just like the Swiss view on cyber privacy and security. 

I've found CHVPS.com and they are perfect but their speeds are certainly lacking. I want everything they offer but the speeds aren't up to par with what I need. 

So I need a point in the right direction here, anyone know any company providing these services for these prices in these areas? and secondly- if not what about a company that performs NO logging whatsoever of its clients? I'd probably entertain that as well until I can actually learn what I'm doing.

I was just wondering if using their VPN system would be sufficient in hiding my activity from my ISP (recently instituted six-strikes anti-piracy policy).

I ran a few simple tests (General IP, DNS leak) and everything identifies my university but not me so it appears safe but I'm not 100% sure.

However, the 3 servers that Ipvanish uses for sweden ... do not come up as from ""sweden"" when i do iplookup. It seems pretty hit or miss from the other servers they list on their ip country list.

I've heard it's 3rd party vendors that are responsible for assigning the ips to various countries .. and that it is an ongoing issue sometimes. 

Since I have only 2 days left of my trial, I was wondering if I should change to a different service if so ... PIA, Hide my ass, or something else?
