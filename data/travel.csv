I have no idea what I'm doing... any advice appreciated.",EarlyMidLifeCrises,930,117,441,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1cm0jn/im_29_quit_my_job_of_over_4_years_and_book_a/,"I made a relatively impulsive decision to quit my job and travel the world. I actually do like my job, but if Im going to travel, I better do it now. The most common refrain I’ve gotten that past couple of days is… “Wow! That’s awesome, I’m so jealous of you. But you’re totally crazy.” Most of my friends actually value their life savings since they have mortgages, families, etc... Not to mention there is no guarantee I’ll be able to find a job when I get back. But, what’s the point of having a life savings if you wait until you’re too old to enjoy it?

I bought a one-way ticket to Auckland, New Zealand leaving May 5th. I know I'm going to be in New Zealand for two weeks, and then I'm going to Australia for two weeks. After that I have no clue.

I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. I've been out of the country before, but never alone. I’m doing this in part to prove that I can take care of myself without someone holding my hand every step of the way. That being said, I have a couple of questions I hoping some of you can answer.

What should I buy before I leave? I already bought a backpack, and a camera, but what other items are essential to have considering I will be traveling relatively light. 

How many weeks of clothing should I pack? I was thinking one or two weeks.

I have friends who say I need get vaccination shots before I go. However, I don’t really know what countries I am going to be visiting, or even what countries I want to visit. Are there any shots that I should get just in case, or are my friends just being overly cautious.

Which countries do I need a visa? How do I go about getting one? Will it be hard to get a visa when I don’t have a set itinerary?

Any fun places you would suggest on that side of the world? The only thing I know about that side of the world is that a Kiwi is a person, not a fruit.

Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated. Hopefully this will give me comfort when I start freaking out that I quit a well-paying job and booked a one-way ticket to the other side of the world.


TL:DR – Early midlife crises, quit my job to travel. Need advice.

EDIT: Wow! Thanks for all the great advice everyone. Way more than I ever expected.

EDIT: So, I got a lot request to start a blog. I liked the idea because it will motivate me to take pictures since I'm usually really lazy with that stuff. Here is the link if you want to follow. I'll probably update it a couple of times before I leave on May 5th.

Edit: There was a comment that my prefacing this post with ""Kurdistan is a great place with a great people"" is racist. I spent 5 months in the Middle East and interacted with Kurds from the get-go. On couchsurfing.com the vast majority of hosts in Turkey are Kurds (a testament to their hospitality) and every time I couch surfed in Turkey I stayed with Kurds. In fact, the main reason I wanted to visit Kurdistan was to visit the homeland of these crazy nice people. Never before have I met a people so welcoming and open without anything expected in return. At first, it was surprising every time I was offered a free meal, offered lodging for the night, or invited into somebody's home (all of this done with a genuine smile).

So I had the talk with my boss today and told him why I'd like to quit. He was surprisingly understanding and very supportive. Now begins the long 3 month notice! I imagine going to work will feel very different knowing each day brings me closer to one of my greatest adventures. 

In October my boyfriend and I will head east and we're not planning to be back until a year later. There is an overall plan, but we try not to get into too much detail. What we do know is that we'll start off with the Trans Siberian Railway, and then through eastern Asia, Australia, NZ over to South America and then all the way up north through USA and Canada. Like this: http://imgur.com/HDTQz

Wow... just writing about it makes my stomach flutter. Anyone out there who has done something similar? I think it might be a bit ambitious, but we're very open to changing things up along the way. My main concerns are about how to keep the relationship healthy (we're both kind if independent) packing, border crossings and money. We've set aside $25K each and are planning on mixing hostels with Bnb, couchsurfing, AirBnb and Wwoofing. 

**TL;DR: in 3 months [this](http://imgur.com/HDTQz) turns into reality!** 

EDIT: Oh my you people are amazing! Posted this thread and didn't get much more than downvotes so I logged out and went to bed. Woke up to this! THIS is the reason I want to travel, I wish I could meet up with all of you and share the experiences over a cup of coffee.

I asked them if they knew any Beatles songs and they started playing ""Yesterday"".  They noticed English was my native tongue so they asked me to sing.  I sang with them and I have a decent voice.  So through the language of music we communicated and they started playing their favorite rock and rolls songs acoustically.  I sang along with them and we actually drew a bit of a crowd and they made decent money.  When they stopped they offered me a share and I said no they could keep it.  Then they asked if I wanted to go to a party with them and keep singing songs.  I said why not and we went to a party in an apartment and sang songs and had a great time.

1350395903.0,379,self.travel,11kis3,How to be a good Couchsurfer,eatmorebeans,437,58,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/11kis3/how_to_be_a_good_couchsurfer/,"Hey r/travel!  
I have been a couchsurfing host for a little over a year now, and have hosted upwards of 20 groups of surfers. I love it so much! The people are great, and I love sharing my city with them. Couchsurfing is an excellent way to travel - you save money and get to see the local spots. Here are a few tips on how you can be the best guest there is:  
  
1. *Write a personalized couch request to your desired host(s).* It makes such a huge difference to me when I can tell someone took the time to read my profile and decide that we would get along well. Those people are always my best guests. 
1. *Be clear about when you're arriving and how you'll be arriving.* I know you're traveling, and you're totally stressed out, but, dude. You're staying at my house FOR FREE! The least you could do would be to communicate with me. If you do, I will tell you the best directions by bus, plane, train, or car, and your life will be that much easier.
1. *Have an idea of at least one thing you'd like to do in the city OR give me a good idea about what you're into.* When people show up with no idea, it's kind of like people posting on /r/travel: What should I do in France? ...Uhhh, I don't know what your hobbies are! Be more specific! I know all of the awesome things to do in my city for many different types of people. I just need to know what kind of things you like to do!  
1. *Be prepared to do some things alone.* I love to hang out with my surfers and show them around the city, but I don't have time to babysit. I have never had any surfers that completely relied on me, but my friends who visit me totally do this, so I just wanted to mention it. 
1. *If you can, do something nice for you host.* Some people take my partner and I out for a beer. Some people do a few dishes. We brought our hosts some veggies from our garden. One British guy left us some of his favorite tea, and our last surfer left us a super nice card (shout out to Andres!). Seriously, though. It means so much when you go that extra step. It's certainly not required, but it's much appreciated.  
1. **PLEASE** *If you can't make it, let me know!* I get excited and prepare for each group of surfers that comes through. When people don't show up, it makes me sad, and I find it kind of offensive. I'm opening up my house to you. Have some decency. I had one couple that were on a bike trip that was a few hundred miles long that were supposed to stay a few days. Halfway through the week there was a snow storm, and I got really worried. They never called and never showed. I was calling them for two weeks to make sure they were okay. Finally, they answered and said they found someone nice in Maryland and decided to stay for 6 months. Really?? You couldn't just call me?

I had just laid down for the night in Istanbul, Turkey. After you've been sleeping outside for a while you develop some kind of intuition for good sleeping places. So when this homeless guy came out of nowhere and asked if he could lay down in the area I was laying, I said ""of course"" - thinking it was his ""home"". He ended up maybe 10 feet away from me. 


Soon it started raining and I came prepared, pulling a water proof sheet over myself. Because the homeless guy didn't have any protection from the rain, I instantly felt bad for him and wanted to invite him over to share my sheet. Though I couldn't couldn't muster up the courage.


After a couple of minutes the rain got worse and he asked me if he could borrow some space under the sheet. Since I already felt bad for not inviting him, I reluctantly accepted. The sheet was pretty big, well enough for two people. One of us misunderstood, or maybe he took it for granted that my acceptance also included sharing my sleeping pad which is barely big enough for me alone. 


He didn't speak english very well so it would have been hard to communicate to him that I only ment the sheet, so I just went with it. I thought to myself: ""what kind of situation have I gotten myself into"" - but hey, you only live once right. Anyway, he slowly moved closer to me and I slowly away from him. It didnt take long before I didn't have anymore sleeping pad to move away from him on. So naturally I tilted up on my side to take less space. It didnt stop him and he continued to move towards me until I was spooning him. (He was moving towards me with his ass first).


When we were spooning I placed my head on my hand supported by my elbow, thinking there is no way I can sleep like this. He took the opportunity to place his head on my elbow. I couldn't do nothing but smile at the situation. He started snoring, and in between two snores he moved his hand on my crouch. It was ontop of my sleeping bag, but still. I gently placed his hand back and didn't know if he did it on purpose or not because of the snoring. After that I heard him unbuckle his pants, which was too much for me. 


He seemed upset at me for not giving him my number before kicking him out.


Bucket list #143 - check.

I don't know how successful this will be, but waiting isn't really a fun game to play when someone's safety may be in question. A friend of mine named Kiel has been traveling through Mexico for the past few months and has not been in contact with family or friends since July 27th. Kiel has an active blog @ http://2guys1truck.com/ and typically checks in weekly if not daily while traveling. Going three (3) weeks without contact is unlike him. His family has just started their efforts in trying to reach him.

Kiel was last heard from on July 27, 2012 while around the city of Oaxaca, Mexico. His picture is on his blog and at this point we're just trying to locate him to know he's safe. 

Kiel has found other european and american travelers along his way and maybe, just maybe this post can reach others who are traveling through the same area in Mexico and provide some information. I've seen Reddit do some incredible things and hopefully it can do another. Lets hope that Kiel is safe and this scare isn't anything serious.

**I have reached out to the US Embassy in Mexico and awaiting to hear back.[see Edit 3 below]** Its a weekend so tough to reach them. Not being a family member I don't know what other recourse I have at this point and if anyone has recommendations please do share.

* Blog: http://2guys1truck.com/
* Name: Kiel
* Notable items: He's a surfer, board should be visible on top of Astro. May have a NY accent, hard to hear among ourselves. He's about 5'-10"" in height.
* Vehicle: [Chevy Astro Van with California plates #5NHG189](http://2guys1truck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Catavina-033.jpg)
* Last check in: Around the city of [Oaxaca, Mexico](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Oaxaca,+Mexico&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=17.052846,-96.683807&amp;spn=0.567832,1.056747&amp;safe=off&amp;hnear=Oaxaca,+Mexico&amp;gl=us&amp;t=m&amp;z=11)
* Picture: [What Kiel looks like](http://2guys1truck.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Aquismon-023.jpg)

For those curious, the URL for his blog is a kickback to when he and a friend did a similar trip last year in 2011. His friend is not with him on this trip.

* **Edit 1**: I've been disconnected twice going through to the Duty Officer in Oaxaca and have yet to actually speak with the Officer. I was once routed to the Mexico City office to find out that if the last known location was Oaxaca to best use that office, the woman wouldn't even take Kiel's info, found that odd. They have my information and I await to hear from them. I'll keep trying. The number I'm calling is 202-647-4000 and asking to speak with the Overseas Citizens Duty Officer. They patch me to what I think is a US based office. I've spoken to a Nick, a Luara, and Jeremy on the line they put me through. I've waited up to 20minutes on hold to reach the Oaxaca field Duty Officer to be disconnected. Very anxious.

If any viewers/readers who have accounts/access to forums/sites Kiel's visited or posted on please share the news at those locations. I'm not aware of all the locations Kiel has been sharing his stories outside his blog.

* **Edit 2**: I've been told he frequented the www.expeditionportal.com forums under the username Wiley. He's tracked his progress in this [thread](http://www.expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/58432-2Guys1Truck-Astro-Van-through-Central-and-South-America-March-2012/page3) which is almost a mirror of his blog.

* **Edit 3**: I've been contacted by his mother with this message ""Thanks for your help. We have called the U.S. Embassy in Oaxaca. The process has been started. We will keep you updated. Thanks for your help and concern. Kiel's mom."" Let's hope its just bad communcation circumstances he's lost touch.

* **Edit 4**: In a holding pattern at the moment. Getting feedback on my postings here and r/mexico. Trying to see who can help and what info they need.

* **Edit 5**: Odd turn of events. My brother who's traveled a lot in his lifetime has a contact in Mexico. She's a friend he made while spending time in Cape Verde, Africa. She's been given some information which I passed on to my brother earlier in the day but have yet to share the details, in particular what Kiel looks like and what he's driving. I'm waiting to be contacted by her. Apparently she has some surfing friends that are in the Veracruz area and may have seen him as he is a surfer himself. He was last in Veracruz shortly before we lost contact with him. At this point any help is better than none.

* **Edit 5**: Some good news. Apparently he was in touch with a friend via email sometime around the 5th. Don't know the exact date, all I've been told was ""..2 weeks ago"". So my guess is the 5th. That is somewhat helpful knowing the time frame is shorter than we had originally thought. Going to try and find out more to confirm the date/time the contact took place.

* **Final Edit**: Kiel has been contacted. As suspected, just lack of avenues for communication. After all it is a vacation and he's enjoying himself. I appreciate the time people took to offer help to strangers. [**Today Me, Tomorrow You**](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/elal2/have_you_ever_picked_up_a_hitchhiker/c18z0z2).

[Post trip cost analysis per day in excel](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B91ptWRJo41hZElRT1M5SkxsTGM/edit?pli=1) 


**Statistics:**

Roughly 9086 miles driven (14622.5km)

Roughly 147 hours in the car (6 days)

Duration of trip was 48 days

The mean spediture for two people (in USD):

Misc (Gifts, gear, stuff for car, parking etc) - $569.53

Beer (Any alochol- buying drinks out or a case of beer) - $744.75

Food (Grocery store or dining out) - $405.29

Sleeping (Camp site, hostel, hotel) $264 

Gas (Petro) - $979.02

**Total Cost - $2992.59**



**Car**

Vechile used was a 1998 Jeep Cherokee with 110,000 miles on it.
-Checked fluids weekly
-No problems but be weary that the Regular octane gas in some Western/Mid-Western states is less that 87. You will have to fill up on Plus for no engine problems.



**Beer**

Bars are expensive but that is where you meet the locals. We knew this from the get go so we factored it in our budget. If you don't don't go out at night you can cut a lot of additional expenses 



**Sleep**

We brought a Eureka Tetragon 7 tent for car camping. 

We each used a Therm-a-Rest Ridge Rest Solar sleeping pad

We used a Go-Lite Down Fleece and REI Travel down sleeping bag

We mostly stayed in campsites. It was spilt 50/50 between pay sites and disperse camping (You can camp legally for free in National Forrests)

We stayed in 4 hostels (New Orleans Lousiana, Moab Utah, Flagstaff Arizson, Vancouever, Canada)

We stayed in 2 hotels (Las Vegas, Nevada, Portland, Oregon)

We stayed with friends or family 5 times (Bay of St Louis, Mississippi, San Antono, Texas, Los Angelels, California, Lake Tahoe, California, Seattle, Washington)



**Eat**

We went to a wholesale groccer (In the US the largest are Costco, BJs, and Sam's Club. We stocked up on food and spent about $120)

Staple luch and or dinner were:

Lipton side dish of noodles or rice with a can of tuna, chicken, or spam

Ramen noddles (I don't use the death packet) with chicken, tuna or spam

Mashed potatoes with chicken, tuna or spam

Used spices, salt, pepper, and olive oil to enhance dishes

Snacks were jerky, chips, cookies, candy, fruit cups (We went through all the snacks in 2 weeks. It was something to do driving so we didn't resupply)

Peanut Butter and ritz crackers or tortias

Gatorade powder

We got ice a few times only to bring Wisconsin cheese back to family

We ate out in big cities to famous places or with friends or to try the local cuisine. And after long treks
We stopped at Grocery stores and Subway to try to get some veggies in

We used a propane car camping stove to cook everything in a 2 quart pot



**Gear**

We are big into backpacking and hiking

Pack was a Talon 44 and High Sierrra 45

We brought a Tarptent Contrail and Six Moon Designs Skyscape Scout for back country camping 

We each used a Therm-a-Rest Ridge Rest Solar sleeping pad

We used a Go-Lite Down Fleece and REI Travel down sleeping bag

Both used trekking poles

I made a Super Cat stove to use for back country camping

No cotton clothes

Light weight hiking shoes (non water proof)

Head Lamp

Aquira Mira Drops

Food was Lipton side dish was chicken or tuna and cliff bars as breakfast


**Favorite places**

Colorado was no place like I've been before. The mountains were awesome and the driving was spectacular. The people were very friendly.

Montana was laid back and Glacier NP was amazing 

Utah was so different so it has to been on the list

People from Texas are freaking nice as hell



**Least favorite places from *OUR* perspective** 

Portland, Oregon- We only had one day there so I would like to come back but we didn't vibe in this city. Lots of homeless and it was dirty. People we met were not fun

Vancouver, Canada - Not a whole lot to do in the city. People were standoffish and there was many homeless parts we wandered into. Left a bad impression. 


**Crazy stories**

Both got arrested in Texas (Seriously, if you're on a road trip and you don't get arrested in Texas you are doing it wrong) 

Had to scare off a 3 black bears from coming into our camping area in Yosemite

When we were backpacking in Glacier through a thick area a black bear stood up 5 feet in front of my us on the trail. It was scary as hell but we shouted and it ran off

In the mountains of Colorado we saw an 18 wheeler 3 cars in front of us making a tight turn then flip on its side. He was fine.



**Tips and tricks**

A smart phone is one of the best tools for a road trip. From finding routes, researching places, finding campsites, googleing stuff, finding cool spots to eat or cool bars that the locals hang out at. Plus reading reddit makes the long drives go faster. Didn't get cell service everywhere (Colorado, Montana, Utah).

Head lamp. Setting up a tent or doing anything at night while having your hands free is invaluable 

We stocked up on food and liquor before to cut costs which helped a lot

National Park Pass (America the Beautiful Pass) is only $80 for two people and you can go to any national park in a year. Without it we would have spent over $200 in total

If it's hot and you don't want to drink warm water soak a sock in water and put your water bottle in it. Hang it out the window. As the water vaporizes it will cool the contents of the water bottle. Just like the way we sweat to cool our bodies.



**How did you do?**

I opened up a separate savings account and used mint.com to track my goal for a road trip. I put $450 in it every month for a 9 months to come close to $4000. I didn't go out or eat out much. I used excel for my daily budget.

I quit my corporate job with 3 months advance notice.

We woke up one morning and left.


**What are we doing now?**

I wanted to switch careers from Insurance to IT. Still applying to jobs in the Tri-State area. Currently waiting tables.

My buddy is a Captain on the Chesapeake Bay and also a documentary film maker. [His latest project if you are interested.](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/381019070/chesapeake-free-documentary-film)

I've seeded it with data for a few countries but it depends on crowdsourcing for its data. Feedback? I'd love me some color combination ideas for the map. My color skillz are non-existent.

[Update]: Wow, that was a much stronger response than I was originally expecting. A bit too overwhelmed to b e able to answer all your guys questions and comments. But a few observations:

1. The site has a valid use-case and is worth spending more of my ever-dwindling personal time on.
2. Apologies for citizens of Thailand, Hong Kong Singapore and the myriad of small-ish countries that went unrepresented. I used the [jvectormap](http://jvectormap.owl-hollow.net) plugin and those countries seem to be missing from there. The Jquery developers amongst you are encouraged to peek at the code on the link and submit patch requests if possible. I might get around to this once I clear my backlog
3. A strong theme in the comments seems to be...""Visas are a bit more complicated than yes/no, true/false, red green."" I heard you guys. I will start looking into ways of incorporating some kind of moderated user content along with each Country-Visa entry. This way, in addition to a quick look you will be able to click through to add/view/edit notes/urls/comments/recommendations that can then be upvoted/downvoted by the crowd.",,False,self,t5_2qh41,True,,,True,t3_ox39a,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ox39a/reddit_you_inspired_me_to_create_a_website_i/,

When booking flights and hostels, double (and triple) check the dates and months. Also, never book *anything* if you have been drinking, only book while sober.


* 2.) On that same note, make up your hostel bed *before* you go out drinking.


* 3.) Get the hell out of big cities and see some countryside and wilderness.


* 4.) Consider the humble bus: often faster and cheaper


* 5.) Ask at train stations about the quickest way to get from point to point; you will be surprised sometimes how helpful train attendants can be.

* 6.) Check multiple Bureau d'Exchanges for best currecy rates

* 7.) *DO NOT* flush toilets while your train is stopped at a station; many trains flush directly onto the track, not into a holding tank

* 8.) I would recommend NOT to make eye contact with gypsies. 

* 9.) Don't be afraid to ignore someone you know is trying to scam you; forget politeness

* 10.) Sometimes, let what happens happen; plans don't necessarily make anything any better

* 11.) Guide books can be great, but ask fellow travelers, hostel staff and locals for advice, it generally never fails

* 12.) Do not show/give your passport to a ""police officer"" unless they can take you to a real police station first, especially in Eastern Europe

* 13.) On the note of passports, its good to have photocopies of your passport when you are asked for them at hostels or different locations. Try to avoid handing your passport to *anyone* who is not an official

* 14.) On the note of Eastern Europe, if you are ever stopped by a cop, always pay the guy, this can save much hassel

* 15.) Do not assume you can check out of your hostel and pay by card (many only take cash), especially if you are in a hurry and your bus/train leaves in 10 min. 

* 16.) Do not feel you need to move on quickly from place to place; if you like somewhere *STAY*! Get to know it

* 17.) Make sure all your credit cards are not ALL stored in the same spot, it is good to have 1 or 2 hidden somewhere in case of emergency

* 18.) If roving information service agents in a train/bus areas help you find your train/bus or give info, keep in mind they may request or demand a tip.

* 19.) Learn to say ""thank you"" ""hello"" ""no"" ""yes"" and ""excuse me"" in the language of whichever country you are in; this can be extremely helpful

* 20.) On that same note, if you are traveling in Greece or a country that uses a Cyrillic alphabet, it can be very helpful to learn how to pronounce the letters. You do not need to learn the language, but just pronounce what you see. For instance, in Bulgarian, the word ""restaurant"" is ""ресторант"", which although looks different, is pronounced almost exactly the same.

BONUS EDIT: A few more points that kind commenters have reminded me of:

* 21.) Get a chip &amp; pin credit card if possible. Although few banks in the US offer them, going thru the hassle to acquire one can be very beneficial. The BeNeLux area of Europe is attempting to phase out swipe cards all together, so in these areas, cash may be your only option without a chip &amp; pin card.

* 22.) DO NOT forget these few simple items: pad-lock, flip-flops, fingernail clippers, ear-plugs, teeny bottle of detergent and small sewing kit

* 23.) If you do travel by bus, make sure you determine if you need to buy tickets before you get on the bus OR when you are already ON the bus. Sometimes, if you get on a bus without a ticket, you will be fined.

* 24.) To echo frasier_crane's comment below, DO NOT trust children. If you see children around you, or approaching you, flee the scene. Scammers will use large amounts of children to either rob you personally or distract you.

* 25.) On that same not, do not let anyone hand you their babies. Scammers will sometimes hand (or sometimes even throw) a real baby or a fake baby to you, in order to disorient or distract you.

* 26.) Be sure to research local tipping protocol. Some areas it is not needed, some it is expected, and some it could be interpreted as offensive to leave a tip. 

* 27.) In crowded tourist areas, do not allow yourself to be wooed into a bar or club with 2 for 1 drink offers, they are usually not as generous as they sound and come with lots of strings.

* 28.) Also, in touristy areas, move over one or two streets, prices can be cut in half on food or drinks

* 29.) Most importantly, if little things go wrong, don't take it too seriously. You are out here to enjoy yourself, not get stressed because you'll have to wait an hour for the next bus you just missed.",,False,self,t5_2qh41,1341164060.0,,,True,t3_vvltc,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/vvltc/my_20_very_useful_travel_tips_for_backpacking/,

Hello /r/travel 

I am new to this Sub and quickly found a new home.  I enjoy reading stories of travel, as well as great tips to save money.  My family has run a travel Agency for over twenty five years and i was wondering if you all would be interested in an AMA in terms of money saving tips, Trip advice, Cruise line suggestions, tours, etc... pretty much anything.  I spoke with my Uncle tonight (He has 25 years in the business alone) and he seemed excited to share his knowledge on this confounded internet box.  Together, his top three agents have about 125 years of experience, and I'm sure they would be more than happy to share their knowledge with you. Heck, ask them about their worst client, or biggest mistake.

Please let me know and i will make it happen, i just don't want to jump the gun.

Thanks!

I just set up my boss with an account he will be posting as **CrownTravelCEO**

1332608988.0,284,self.travel,rbk3i,My partner and I hitchhiked from Cancun to Tierra del Fuego on a $5/day budget for 13 months. I'm happy to answer any questions about shoestring traveling/hitchhiking. AMA,lameparadox,322,38,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/rbk3i/my_partner_and_i_hitchhiked_from_cancun_to_tierra/,"After graduating from college, my partner and I decided to have an adventure while we were still young and unfettered by commitments. So we bought the cheapest flight to Mexico from Washington DC: Cancun. From there, we hitchhiked through Mexico, Central America, and South America for 13 months, until the southernmost city of the Americas, Ushuaia in Tierra del Fuego. Of course, it was a great experience - a lesson of hospitality, frugal living, language learning, and cultures.

We had never hitchhiked before in our lives, but we picked up the ropes quickly. Mexico was the perfect starting ground - hitchhiking is a widely-accepted practice there, and the senors and senoritas are very happy to help anyone out there. We never stayed in hostels - we stealth-camped with our tent, asked people and police where we could camp, got invited into their homes and stations quite often with wonderful hospitality. We also WWOOFed (in Mexico and Argentina), and used couchsurfing (we must've couchsurfed at least once almost every country we've been in).

And yes, we made it under $5 a day for food, travel, and lodging. Since lodging is free, travel is free, we only had to worry about spending on food and miscellaneous stuff, and we ate cheap street food and never got sick. 

It should be said that we are both Deaf and do not speak one word between us (we sign with each other... and no, sign language isn't universal), but we got along with the locals just fine with our pen and paper (hablamos español bien bastante). I saved all of the conversations i've had with people on paper in my backpack. I still have them, waiting for the right moment and inspiration to seize me into writing a book or something.

So ask me anything you might want to know about traveling in such a fashion or about the places.

Countries we hitchhiked: Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay. (we actually went north from Ushuaia to see the Iguazu Falls then returned to Buenos Aires to catch the flight back to the states.)

Here's some of the pics I thought you might find interesting:

I lost her email address when cycling back. The picture was taken August 27th, 2007. Please help me find it.",genji256,262,37,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ort2m/when_reaching_the_arctic_ocean_after_having/,"Hi,

This is my first post here and I need help. I thought I had exhausted all my options, but now that I know about reddit and the impressive power of its community, I'm giving it another try.

In the summer of 2007, my brother and I cycled from Vancouver to the Arctic Ocean. Just before reaching Deadhorse, in Alaska, a tourist bus from the company ""1st Alaska Outdoor School"", driven by a guy named Ralf Dobrovolny, passed us. As we reached the town, my brother and I fell in each other's arms next to the passengers of the bus.

Amongst the passengers, a Norwegian photographer (I think) who was with her boyfriend (husband?) took a picture of my brother and I. I asked for her email address, which she gave me, but I lost the paper when we cycled to Anchorage. It was August 27th, 2007 and we all went for a tour of the oilfield afterwards.

This trip means a lot to my brother and I and, despite all my attempts in the last 4 years (I called Ralf who replied he couldn't find the name of the woman and the hotel in charge of the tours of the oilfield told me they had deleted their records), I haven't been able to find the name of that woman. I would be extremely grateful to anyone who could help me.

Thank you.

Edit: a picture of us taken in front of the Arctic Ocean: http://imgur.com/VXjVp .

Edit 2: correcting grammar and formulation.

I'm sitting in a starbucks in lucerne wondering what I was thinking. I can't find fun things to do, and have had no luck finding other travelers to do things with. I don't like going to bars alone either.

1343070382.0,220,self.travel,x138q,My 22 very useful tips for hosteling in Europe,DonTago,255,35,145,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/x138q/my_22_very_useful_tips_for_hosteling_in_europe/,"I have been doing some extensive hosteling lately. I wanted to share some tips that I think could make your and everyone's hosteling experiences a little more enjoyable.

*   (1) Always make sure you have earplugs and face-mask for sleeping when in a noisy dorm room

*   (2) Sheets are often included in most hostels these days, but it does NOT hurt to have a sleeper sheet just in case you run across the odd one that does not

*  (3) Many hostels do NOT allow alcohol. Make sure to check before you go on a beer/wine run

*  (4) Some hostels disallow you access into your room during certain times of the day for cleaning. This is not extremely common, but check first; you may only have one chance to grab everything once cleaning starts.

*  (5) Many hostels do NOT provide towels with their linens. Make sure to bring your own just in case

*  (6) Many hostels, esp. in Eastern Europe, only take cash. Do not roll out to pay during check-out when you are about to catch a train and expect that you'll be able to pay with credit. Always have cash available at check out just in case.

*  (7) AVOID leaving your passport as a deposit. Reception will often ask this in lieu of paying at check-in, but do whatever it takes to prevent this situation. 

*  (8) Keep in mind when making reservations at hostels (esp. online), that if you cancel within 24hrs of scheduled check-in, they will probably charge you for that first night stay, no matter what. That is common policy.

*  (9) You commonly find hostels without lockers. While I have not had any problems myself, if you have super valuable things, most often staff will be more than happy to hold onto these items for you while you are out and about. [also bring a pad-lock, you will often need it for lockers]

*  (10) Always wear sandals in the shower at hostels. While traveling, your feet are one of your most important assets; protect them!

*  (11) Just about all hostels have free WIFI these days, so don't worry about staying connected with back home

*  (12) Read reviews for hostels, but do NOT go overboard with them. I have stayed in great reviewer-rated hostels and had a bad time and vice versa. Part of hosteling is what you make of it.

*  (13) When trying to locate a hostel, make SURE to read the hostels write-up for directions. DO NOT solely rely on the ""push-pins"" on GoogleMaps; they have often led me astray. Also, sometimes hostels are tucked away so indiscreetly, you would never find them without specific instructions.

*  (14) Get to know the hostel owner/host. Hostel owners in areas tend to know each other, so they can give you good tips on hostel choices in your next destination.

*  (15) In my experience, the best hostel is one you can walk to from the bus/train station. The last thing you want after an 8 hour train/bus ride is to have to figure out the public transit system at 11 at night in a strange city just to get to the place you want to sleep.

*  (16) Meet as many new people as you can!  Everyone at a hostel has 1 thing in common; they are travellers. Get to know them. When you get back home to your apartment, you will be sad meeting people won't be this easy anymore.

*  (17) DO NOT leave your shampoo in the shower. Shampoo is a hot commodity to the backpacker. If it is left around, it will soon most likely be gone, esp. in a busy hostel.

*  (18) If you are leaving on an early train, do not turn the lights on at 5am to pack. Back the night before. Turning the lights on while a majority of ppl in the dorm are sleeping is BAD. This means you too party groups coming back at 3am.

*  (19) Watch for bedbugs! Read hostel reviews, ask current hostel-goers upon arrival and check manually if really concerned. Being plagued with bedbugs is something I would not even wish upon my enemies!

*  (20) Make SURE not to leave your wallet in the pocket of your trousers laying next to your bed before you turn in for the night. If someone in the room DOES plan to steal from you, that would probably be the first place they look.

*  (21) Always pick a bottom bunk! They are easier to get in/out of, closer to electric outlets and easier to arrange your stuff around.

*  (22) As a hosteler, keep in mind one thing; to ensure happiness, be satisfied with the bear minimum! These are not hotels, there is no concierge, no room-service, no mint on the pillows. You are a traveller, *not* a tourist. Life is an adventure. Do not throw a tantrum because there is no hot water.

However, there are many things I hate about it. First, I'm completely burnt out. I have to travel 8+ hours a week to my client. Im away from home during the week. Staying at a hotel and going out to eat every night is old. I'm sick of the work and the cut throat people I work with. In addition, I don't think I'm cut out for the corporate world. I've been on the project for a year and a half now and my assigment is coming to an end mid October. I have $60,000+ saved and I'm considering taking a break from work for a few months and traveling the world. 

-No house or apartment. I'm at my rents until my assignments over
-No loans. All paid off. 

My logical mind is telling me that it's a bad idea. I'm concerned about finding work when I return. I've made a significant effort to get to where I am now. Im also I'm not sure how my girlfriend would take it. I've joked around with the idea, but she doesn't know I'm serious. 

I'm looking for some advice, feedback and suggestions. Am I crazy? Should I just do it? 

EDIT: 7:24 EST. Just got back from work. I wasn't expecting the overwhelming amount of responses. Thank you all for your comments and support! That's what I needed.

I plan on talking to my girl and family about it tonight. I'll keep you all updated!

I dont know what to expect because I've read and heard mixed reviews. Not really sure what i'm going to do with all my time.

If any redditors could help with some helpful tips or travel experience in south America I would greatly appreciate it.
If any other Redditors are making a similar trip please join in.
Many thanks in advance!

I've given this choice lots of thought over the years. This has always been on my bucket list. My break happened last year and I'm just ready to move forward and try pursuing something else.

Given the fact that I live on the east coast of the United States, it cost too much for friends or family to join me on this trip.

All I can say is that it was probably the best trip of my entire life. Aside from the one ""tour"" I took in order to get into semi-restricted areas of Pearl Harbor that you cannot do when you're by yourself, I did everything on my own terms. If I wanted to go on a hike even though I got hopelessly lost for an hour, I would go on a hike. If I needed a breather while staying active I would relax.

Hell, I befriended a couple of other travelers and somehow managed to get drunk with them both nights. Hilariously, every bartender and other travelers we spoke to would ask how we knew each other...even though the answer was ""We met each other x hours/days ago.""

Regardless, it felt good being able to be active and to do enjoy myself somewhere far away from home on my own time for once. I highly recommend everyone to travel alone at least once. Hell, I only did this for 4 days, 1 of which was strictly education-related, and had the best trip of my life.

Oh yeah, and it doesn't hurt when one of the stars of your top 5 TV shows is sitting right across the aisle from you on the last plane back home.

I'd just like to comment on some things that I've seen this current tourist high season:

If you see a child begging at a street corner or public transport area, please, *do not* give them money. I *know* it is heart breaking to see a child in rags but you are (in the long run) not helping.

Education in many developing countries, including Thailand, is actually free. However, when I see a tourist dropping their change to a child of school-going age *on a school day* it means only one thing - the child is getting less and less incentive to go to the school.

The same goes for children selling things. This is not so much a problem at corners or even that prevalent in Bangkok, but certainly around South East Asia, if you get around enough, you will be swamped at some landmark by kids selling souveniers. The only definite place I know of for this in Bangkok is kids pulling the ['release a bird' scam](http://www.thai-blogs.com/2007/04/11/tourist-scams-in-bangkok/) at the Grand Palace. In a situation like this, where there is tourist tat you might want, even if it's not a school day, I would encourage you to direct your custom to an adult. Even directly tell the adult why you are buying from them - kids shouldn't be working.

Giving to the needy in poorer areas can help a lot and is commendable; however, please give to adults and never to children. If you really want to help children consider spending even just a few days voluntarily helping at the many orphanages and shelters in South East Asia or the equivalent in other areas.",,False,self,t5_2qh41,False,,mys,True,t3_q5cqa,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/q5cqa/responsible_travel_giving_to_begging_children/,

That was until I did a bit of research on reddit and other travel sites such as Lonely Planet, where nearly everyone seemed to be saying that Greyhounds were basically piss-stained prisons on wheels, full of tramps and 'questionable' individuals. 

Obviously they aren't all as bad as that, but are they so bad that I should reconsider how I'm going to get from Miami to LA?
(Oh, and renting a car is not an option)

TL;DR: Are Greyhounds so bad that I should essentially avoid them at all costs?

EDIT:Thanks for all the advice, I really appreciate it! I'm going to have another look at Amtrak, in the meantime, I don't suppose anyone would have any tips of things to do in New Orleans, Austin or Phoenix that they particularly love to do? Thanks again!

EDIT 2: Wow, I never thought this many people would respond! After using the Amtrak site and Skyscanner I think I have a trip planned that doesn't involve Greyhounds whatsoever! From what's been said, it's clear that the scenery from a Greyhound has nothing on a the scenery from an Amtrak, so I've managed to build in the California Zephyr route (the whole thing) and the last part of the Coastal Starlight (going towards LA). I truly appreciate you all sharing your experiences and opinions, know that you have helped shaped my dream holiday (and first to the US). If anyone is curious of the exact route I'm taking, or the approximate costings of a months travel in the US, ask and ye shall receive.

I was going to go to law school this year, but I decided against it.  I have always wanted to travel, teach, and learn a new language.  What better way than to teach an ESL class?  

A few of my friends have been to China and Spain, but what are your experiences?  I honestly don't have a strong preference on where I go.

Which organizations pay best and are the most trustworthy?  

Do I need to get certified or take any classes beforehand, or is that just a scam?  I have been doing research, but it's hard to find an objective article that isn't trying to sell me classes.  

I have a Bachelor of Arts in English, and I'm from the US.  Thanks, guys. I appreciate your advice as I contemplate this potentially life changing experience!

I arrived in Tallinn safe and sound.  The weather was beautiful, and for once I was very happy to actually be walking outside in this beautiful Baltic town.  I stopped in at my favorite pub in the old town district, and gorged myself at the cheap food, as well as had a beer or two (the prices are just SO much better then Finland's).  After I finished my meal, I decided to go find the Tallinn bus station, as I would be departing their tomorrow morning bound for Lithuania.  As I was walking down the cobbled streets, I noticed an American flag lofting gently in the wind- the American embassy.  With a little bit of pride, and equal parts home sickness, I lifted my camera to take a picture.  That was a mistake.  As soon as I hit the button, I heard alarms and whistles.  Before I knew what was happening, two large men had grabbed me by either arm and were dragging me into the embassy.  ""What did I do?!"" I inquired.  ""Possible terrorist activities"" the guard responded, as he pointed at the ridiculously tinted windows to a barely visible sticker- a ""no cameras"" symbol.  ""Oh you have got to be shitting me"" I thought.  As I was brought into the embassy, I frantically tried to explain that I was an American.  I even offered up my passport as proof.  They took my passport, took my photo, and searched my bag.  I got held for 45 minutes while they ""processed me"".  Eventually, after I was deemed ""non-threatening"", I was released to go back on my merry little way.  This may have been the funniest shit that ever happened to me.

Moral of the story- no wonder the rest of the world thinks American's are crazy.

PS. To the Estonian guards who were watching me, thank you for lightening the situation by cracking jokes about how moronic this was with me.  You guys really helped.

TL:DR- I took a picture of the US embassy in Tallinn, Estonia, got detained for 45 minutes, had a mug shot taken, and was searched.  I'm an American citizen.",,False,self,t5_2qh41,False,,,True,t3_ruqgi,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/ruqgi/beware_your_own_country_a_true_story/,

Since the revolution, the country and especially the tourist industry is really struggling. As a result, scams and hassles are much more aggressive than previously and today I got a good one.

A guy came up to me on the street, asking if I could write English because he wanted to text someone in England.  I'm pretty savvy to peoples BS and didn't really trust the guy, but figured I had nothing to lose and would do him a favor, as he insisted he was not trying to get anything form me and I wasn't in a hurry.  We go to a restaurant, he ordered two beers, we have a decent conversation and I write the message for him.  When it comes time to pay, naturally he tries to get me to pay for both beers. I remind him I never agreed to buy him a beer, I was spending my time to do him a favor and I refused to pay for HIS beer. He flipped out, started shouting about how horrible Americans are and all that. I stayed calm, paid for my beer and walked out.  About 100 meters outside of the bar, he chases me down on his bicycle, in order to shout about Americans again and tell me he was happy about the Boston bombings. Again, I stayed calm, said ""good for you"" and ignored him until he left.

At the same time, an Indian man also traveling overheard the exchange, and we ended up sitting down to chat. He bought me a fruit juice, turned out he lived two hours away and we agreed to contact each other if we passed through our respective cities. A few minutes later, I got lost (Egyptian streets are confusing, man) and couldn't find my hotel. After asking for directions, an Egyptian man who didn't really speak English, and I certainly don't speak Arabic, discussed it with the neighbors on the street and gave me a ride to the door of my hotel on his motorcycle.

Here are some tips.

* If you are booking a hotel room online, by all means check third party websites like hotels.com, booking.com, expedia etc. Find your dates and compare rates. But then, call the actual hotel reservation line and tell them. They will most likely match the rates you found and probably give you a better deal or free stuff. Reason? They sell wholesale to third party sites, so therefore can sell for less than what third party sites retail for and still make more money.

*  Hotels often jokingly refer to their crappier rooms as the ""expedia"" rooms. In other words, how you book influences what you receive; they make less profit from third party bookings. Not all bookings are equal.

* The term ""Best Available Rate"" does not actually mean the lowest rate available. That's just what they call the standard rate. 

*  After being quoted a ""best available rate"", ask if there are any other promotions. If there's good inventory, there will be. Sometimes you need to know the codes to get them, though. Joining the hotel's loyalty program (email list) will get you those codes.

* Some pro stuff tips: Try asking for a ""friends and family rate"". Just say you know someone at the hotel (if talking to a call center). They typically don't check that stuff. The FFR can be substantially cheaper. Alternatively, ask for the ""global business program"" rate. That's typically a rate offered to businesses that don't already have negotiated rates, and can be 20% less than BAR (Best Available Rate). If you're actually on a business trip this is legit in most cases.

* NEVER book an Advanced Purchase Rate if you can help it. These are usually pre-paid, non-cancellable and non-refundable. If you're being offered this kind of rate on a website, read the fine print. Also, if this rate is available, typically there's always another promotion that's at least as cheap, that you don't have to pre-pay and that can be cancelled.

* If you book online, for chrissakes don't book the frigging ""accessible"" rooms unless you're actually handicapped. Yes, ""accessible"" means ADA compliant. People book these all the time because websites don't care, they just list inventories from databases, and they usually don't point out the difference. I get calls every day because of this. 

* Rates for the same room, on the same date will change alot in the time preceding. I've seen rooms booked at $150 go for $600 a few days before the actual date. So yes, rates change. There is no set rate. I've also seen them get really cheap if the rooms didn't sell. Best advice; book it 2 months in advance if possible. Call back 1 month beforehand to see if you can lower the rate; if there's a promo on or something, they will do it no problem. Call back a few days beforehand for the same reason. Some people know this strategy and it works well for them.

* AAA discounts are actually pretty good, and if you travel more than 3 days a year, it's worth it.",,False,self,t5_2qh41,False,,,True,t3_1gniyr,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1gniyr/some_advice_from_the_hotel_business/,

Is it worth traveling solo dolo? ,eu_or_aus,214,44,160,http://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/15groc/i_recently_became_single_im_used_to_traveling/,"This was touched off by a post elsewhere in r/travel. The person said that they generally plan a trip every 6 months. 

Now, I've been in LTRs most of my adult life, so I always traveled with my girlfriend. When we were apart, we would travel to each other and have fun in the other person's city. Now, however, I'm single. I've traveled alone of course, but there was always some family or friends on the other side. I don't mind flying or riding the bus alone, but I'd like to have someone there at the destination. 

To add to that, and compounding the problem, I moved back to my home country where I don't have any friends and I haven't made any strong enough friendships to travel with. Plus I don't know if my ideas of travel gel with the people I've met. I want to travel to Thailand, Japan, maybe S Korea and Vietnam etc. 

Sooo... I have enough vacation time saved up that I can take about 2 weeks off next year, before I travel to Europe. I would like to see Asia, or at least the parts I've mentioned above. 

I'm scared of traveling alone though. Not that I'm worried about crime, but more of being lonely. I once traveled alone to a small town that I had good memories of, and I was so lonely that I cut short my trip and came back the very next day. I wanted someone to share the happiness with. 

What are your thoughts? Do you always (or even mostly) travel alone? Is it worth it? Do you have more or less fun? Is it better to plan out your trip completely so that you have a full day and come back home tired? Does it depend on the country and how outgoing you are? In my country it is taboo to talk to people unless you want something from them, unless you're white in which case everyone wants to talk to you. Luckily I'm far more outgoing now than I was when I made that solo trip, but its still scary to think about how lonely I could feel.

EDIT: Wow, so many responses, all telling me to go ahead and travel alone, and so many fun stories and anecdotes!

I'm from the US, a 27-year-old male, and I have never traveled alone and have only been to London and Amsterdam in Europe.  I was able to navigate the train system and found my hotel all right, but then it all hit me like a freight train, and I started to panic.  I'm really far from home, and I know no one.  So I did what any anxious-ridden traveler does; I slept.  

I woke up feeling a little bit better, and after writing my parents, I went for a walk.  I probably walked around for a good three hours, got lost, and found my way back to my hotel.  I ate at the Hard Rock (I know...) and got drunk with an older Australian gentleman.   I met a really nice Swedish girl at the next bar I went to with the Australian, but she left shortly after with her friends.  I was pretty drunk and having a great time, but I decided it would be best to go back to the hotel.

So today I wake up late with a pretty bad hangover.  I shower, dress, and decide to do some more exploring; but I have no idea what I'm doing and I felt like crap.  I wanted to eat some good hangover food, but the language barrier really kicked my ass.  I have a bad stomach already, so I was feeling it ten-fold and didn't want to end up buying something that would make it worse.  I ended up buying a fruit smoothie from a street vendor and it helped, but now I'm really hungry again.  

I don't know what I'm expecting, but please tell me it gets better.  I can deal with loneliness fine,  but the constant stress of where to eat, what to eat, what train to get on, and the language barrier is getting to me.  I really want this to be the best time of my life, but I feel just like a scared dude in a strange land.

UPDATE:  Wow, I didn't know I would get such an awesome, kind response, but Reddit comes through again.  I tried to respond to everyone, and thank you all so much for your kind words.  I ended up reading for a little after I wrote this and took another nap.  It's now 7:00 p.m. local time, and I'm going to try and find a nice restaurant for a good meal.  I do plan on hosteling but wanted to ease into it with a hotel for the first few nights.  I think part of the problem is that I don't have anything planned, and it just contributes to the lost feeling.  The people here are generally very nice (even the hookers outside my hotel), and I know that the world is a good place overall -- oh, and the Danish women, I don't think I've seen an ugly one.  Can anyone recommend a fun city to the west of here?  I'm thinking I want to see Normandy beach (grandfather passed thru in WWII) before the weather gets crummy, and then I'll head back east into Germany for Oktoberfest.  I have two more nights here in Copenhagen before I head out, but I should probably start planning.

When we landed at Midway I found that they held my connecting flight for me. The gate agent actually said, ""We've been waiting for you!"" and the boarding gate closed behind me.

After landing in Orlando, I go straight to the baggage office to make a claim, figuring my bags would come in from Chicago on a later flight.  While waiting I spied a familiar looking duffle on the carousel. My bags actually made it with me too!

It was the best four days of my trip so far.  The country is amazing and the people are incredibly kind.

Yesterday I decided to venture from my hostel in Kotor to the Skadar lake in southern Montenegro.  It is about 100 km and took about two hours to get there via bus.  It was beautiful and I ate freshwater fish at a lovely restaurant for 5 euros.

I had a great day and was on my way back to Kotor when I realized I didn't have my camera. In a panic I thought of the last two months of pictures that had yet to be uploaded and the next three weeks of my trip that would go undocumented. 

Fairly sad, I return to the hostel and the receptionist immediately knows something is wrong.  I explain the story and he is sure that I'll get it back.  I describe the area I was in and he knows the place I ate at because it was one of the few eating establishments in the national park.  He calls and they have it, the owner of the restaurant says he is going to take it to the other hostel in the capital city of Montenegro, Pogorica that night.

Once my camera was at the other hostel, they said they were going to put it on a bus up to Kotor in the morning.  

In the morning, I got my camera and restored my faith in humanity.  I am fairly certain that in any other country, my camera would have been lost forever but the absolute kindness of montenegrans returned my camera to me less than a day later.

I'm just really having a lot of trouble committing to the idea of buying a one way ticket and traveling somewhere. I know that if I don't do this now, I will regret it for the rest of my life. It's just a huge risk for me and I feel bad spending all of my savings. In addition, I'm still paying off my student loans, but I'm not too worried about those. They'll be waiting for me when I get back. Regardless, how do you find the courage to just get up and go? It's definitely a desire that exists within me, I just need some inspiration.

I want to do what I can to enact positive change both globally and locally. I love and live for travel and am extremely fortunate to have seen so many different places in my short life. I thrive off of gaining knowledge regarding different cultures, peoples, and places. However, sometimes my confidence in people and how they treat each other is questioned and causes me to question what I'm doing. While travelling, I understand there are many cultural differences that inadvertenly cause riffs and divisions between people simply because they are foreign, or 'Falang' as they call us in the part of the world I am currently in. Right now I'm doing volunteer work in Vang Vieng, Laos. There are frequently deaths here due to people coming here solely to get drunk and do drugs. Maybe that's why there seems to be a deep resentment for visitors here amongst many of the local people, although not all. 

Last night a man died in town. I don't know his name or where he is from. I guess he had an alergic reaction to an insect bite, but in the early hours of the morning he collapsed in the gutter, convulsing. I had gotten separated from my friends, and I was not there, but one of my good friends that I've met travelling came upon this man on his own. Nobody was helping him as he lay there dying on the street, and this is not an uncommon reaction to such a situation. There were witnesses, but my friend was the one who had to wake up a local bar owner to try and get this man to the hospital. He managed to secure him a ride to the hospital on the back of a motorbike, but he died before he arrived. Today, that same friend was riding back to the farm where we stay and the chain snapped on his motorbike. He was lucky not to have been severely hurt, and I think his prior experience with bikes is what made all the difference. If I were on that bike, I most likely wouldn't have been so lucky. The point is he sat on the side of the road for two hours trying to wave people down to get help, but nobody would help him. One tuk tuk driver eventually stopped and then charged my friend a relatively large sum of money to borrow his tools to fix the broken bike. It's hard for me to want to help communities who refuse to help the visitors to those communities, and I feel guilty for it because it's essentially my job. It's uniquely beautiful here, but dangerous. I find myself losing confidence in mine and others ability to make any positive change, and I find myself developing a resentment to those here who won't help a foreigner simply because he/she is Falang. I'm no stranger to racial prejudice, but it disturbs me that in a place where there is so much death there seems to be little desire to help those dying or those in need. While I've been here I've met both murderers and victims, but have also seen the indifference with which both are treated. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is be careful while you're exploring this world. Self-preservation is of the utmost importance. You cannot rely on the benvolence of others to ensure your own safety. There are good people and there are bad people everywhere, but when you're not in your own country you are much more vulnerable regardless of the individuals around you. Travel safe, travel smart, and travel respectfully. Don't be the reason cultural divisions are augmented. Think about your actions before you act, because while you may be moving on shortly, the impressions that you leave behind will affect the next traveller who comes and takes your place.

So far, we've been to North America, Asia (China and Japan for our honeymoon just over a year ago) and Europe (multiple trips to various countries).

We recently did some credit card offers that got us 450,000 AA miles total and certainly plan on using the shit out of them.

Next up is a trip to Buenos Aires or Rio, not too sure yet which we'll choose, I'd love to get recommendations.

Australia seems like a pretty simple continent to visit, just expensive to get there, with miles it'll be slightly easier.

Africa and Antarctica appear to be the big challenges. Has anyone had great experiences visiting either of them that they'd be willing to share? I'd love especially to know if there are ways to visit Antarctica cheaply (besides trying to go through an employer). It's not enough for me to cruise around the continent.
