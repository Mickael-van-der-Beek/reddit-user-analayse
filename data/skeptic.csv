http://tjomlid.com/2012/06/28/xocai-the-nasty-tale-of-a-norwegian-chocolate-mafia/

A couple of years ago, a norwegian blogger published an article where he criticised several of the fantastic claims made by chocolate pyramid company [MXI corp](http://www.mxicorp.com/). concerning it's chocolate ""XoCai"".

This went largely unnoticed, yet as time moved forward his blog crept up the Google search hits, until it hit first place when searching for ""XoCai"".

This obviously did not sit well with the pyramid marketers of the product in question, even if they did have a chance to respond to the blog before it was published (the author contacted 15 marketers, as well as the board).

Their solution? Threaten legal action (seven figures in dollars), [publish personal information about the blogger](http://tjomlid.com/wp-content/uploads/Xocai_trussel_vedlegg.jpg?b793bb) (including his residence and instructions on how to get there), photos of his family, contact information for his employer and ominous threats of the type 
 
*""...In closed FB groups, creative suggestions are being put foreward from our members on how to stop your attack on Xocai once and for all"".* and  
*""..Some of our members are keen on gathering a group of people to come visit you face to face at [address].:""*

After some discussion back and forth where the blogger tried to enquire which specific points on his blog they thought were incorrect, offering them a chance to correct him (they responded with more threats), he was finally coerced into removing his blog posts since XoCai were targeting his employer. Xocai then removed his personal details from their homepages.

However the story does not stop there.  
Gunnar Tjomlid [posted the story](http://tjomlid.com/?p=6650) about this whole ordeal in *details* on his blog ""unfiltered perception"" yesterday (the 26th) and from there it took off hitting [national news](http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=no&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=no&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nrk.no%2Fhelse-forbruk-og-livsstil%2F1.8222691) and crashing his blog a few times.

The original article that led to this situation has been shared a few thousand times via facebook, reposted on tens of blogs and are referenced to from several major news sites.

TL;DR: Chocolate thugs fail miserably in trying to bully skeptic blogger by threatening his family and career. 

------------
Update:
[English article on doubtfulnews.com](http://doubtfulnews.com/2012/06/xocai-is-not-okay-legal-threat-against-skeptical-critic-in-norway/)

User MarcusGP also has a translation of the original blog post which will be made available as soon as it has been approved (by Gunnar, presumably).

I also got a reply from the MXI Corp. after having informed them about the events, here is what they wrote to me in reply:

*""We apologize for this response you have read in a recent blog.  This response was not sanctioned by MXI Corp.  We are currently investigating this.  Thank you for bringing this to our attention.*

*Sincerely,  
MXI Corp""*

It seems like however they might have been involved with this regarding any legal matters prior to Gunnar's blog post, they now distance themselves from their norwegian subsidiary.

He also knew it was a book club meeting, but had no idea which book it was, and the friend assured him that he could receive a copy upon arrival and participate in the discussion.

Having never heard of “The Secret,” he figured out pretty quickly that it was bullshit. Apparently, at the last meeting, the group had decided to visualize a white feather during the upcoming week, and now they were going around the circle talking about how this white feather had come into existence in each of their lives. From seeing a white bird, to some random decoration, to a design on a webpage – of course if you are looking for something as typical as a feather, you are going to find it. 

So it becomes his turn and they ask, “well, since you didn’t get the feather instructions, have you noticed anything that you were thinking about this week that came true?” 

He replies, “Actually, I had a patient this week (he is a nurse), who I was really worried about. His blood work just didn’t look right, and I wasn’t confident in the doctor’s orders. I thought about him for days, visualizing what I afraid would happen, and checking back regularly. Yesterday, I found out he died.” 

All in unison they replied, “NO! That is definitely not the same thing!! Don’t worry, you did not cause that man to die! Your thoughts had nothing to do with that!”

I’m so proud of him =)

&gt;I don't believe this to necessarily mean anything at all, and I have never said this outloud, but the fucking ""walking under street lights and them turning off"" thing has been increasingly happening to me recently. Like, once or twice a week it has happened for the last 3 months.
Maybe it's less and I am getting confirmation bias, I don't know. Maybe I'll start actually making a mark in my diary when it happens and have more information.

[permalink](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/slnx3/come_clean_what_is_something_you_believe_that_the/c4f4d6e)

So I started marking in my phone every time it happened, fully expecting it to turn out to be rare. To my surprise, it continued to happen on average about once a fortnight.

Then one day, I was sitting in my car, waiting to pick up my girlfriend, when ""click"", it happens again. I get out my phone and mark the date. Then the streetlight turns on again. A car drives past 30 seconds later, then sure enough, after 4 or 5 minutes ""click"" it goes off again.

Obviously when I first noticed this trend happening, I did a search for motion sensing lights, and most just came up with why they're a bad idea. But this time was damn obvious. I searched ""motion sensing"" and the name of the street I was on, and sure enough the council had been rolling out motion sensing streetlights on a a number of streets in my area that are triggered by cars approaching and turn on when the car is at the end of the road. It's not all streetlights, just several per street as apparently the council still tries to maintains a certain light reading at all times. They are triggered by cars, and not pedestrians, hence why they have a habit of turning off while I'm walking near by. They probably turn off and on hundreds of times per night.

1307497016.0,421,self.skeptic,hu8sb,"Between December 2010 and now I became an atheist, threw out all of my homeopathy and started vaccinating my kids. ",Lotsofvaxqs,486,65,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/hu8sb/between_december_2010_and_now_i_became_an_atheist/,"I've wanted to submit this many times, but I've always been *really* afraid to say much. I did come here for advice several months ago and actually found it to be very helpful. A recent [article](http://skepticblog.org/2011/06/06/anti-vaxers-and-the-need-for-clarity/?sms_ss=reddit&amp;at_xt=4ded50c86c6b3fac%2C0) posted here finally prompted me to go ahead and post. 



I was raised in a Christian household. When I moved out I encountered the real world, had my beliefs challenged and saw that maybe things weren't what I thought they were. I considered myself an atheist from then until about 25 when I converted back to Christianity. It was absolutely tied to an emotional crisis. I was suffering from postpartum depression.



My mother asked me to talk to her pastor. I was at such a low I didn't fight it. It became a crutch for me during that time. It really is ridiculous when I look back because no god ever cured me of ppd. Medicine and postpartum therapy did (after baby #2). Yet I still clung to that belief system for a total of 3 years. 



Prior to this ""religious intervention"" I found myself drawn to ""natural living"". I think the idea of simplicity and control appealed to me during a time where things felt out of control. It was in this group that I became aware of the anti-vax movement. My oldest had received her first hep b in the hospital. I decided I was going to wait on the others and begged my husband to let me research before we did more. 



The problem with my ""research""  into vaccinations was that it really only served to fuel my already mounting PPD and fears. That is because it was full of fear mongering, bad science and conspiracy theories. Another slightly ironic thing to note here is that my PPD manifested in both depression and Postpartum OCD. I became obsessed with germs and viruses. You would think that would push me toward vaccinations, but the type of propaganda out there in anti-vax land really leads you to believe that vaccinations are making all of our immune systems weak. So I was afraid. I shouldn't have let my fears put others at risk. For that I am sorry.



As the clouds of my PPD started to lift I began to exam everything in my life. First on the agenda was Christianity. I left a Christian message board I was on in Dec. '10 and found reddit. I stumbled into r/atheism and felt like my memory had returned to me. All of the things I knew and understood before came flooding back and I felt like a giant moron. It was like my brain turned back on. 



From r/atheism I came to find r/skeptic. It was here that I started to examine my thoughts on homeopathy, anti-vaccination movements, etc. I watched that BBC Horizon video with James Randi, read several studies and then promptly went and threw out all of my homeopathic voodoo. Again feeling like a complete moron.


Vaccines were the hardest for me to overcome. For some reason that one had taken the strongest hold of my worst fears. Someone in a thread here on vaccinations hit the nail on the head for me one day. He discussed the idea of being passively responsible for something happening to your child  vs. actively. In other words, many regular parents that are afraid of vaccinations feel that if their child gets sick from the disease, they didn't directly cause it. Whereas if the child died from the vaccine they would feel as if they actively caused their child's death. It is completely irrational. But it explains a lot of the feeling swirling in that group (to some degree).


Well, my kids all started their vaccinations last week.  Right up until the hour before I took child #1 to get their vaccinations I was reading articles on r/skeptic about vaccinations and the science behind them. 


Thought I'd give you all a little insight into the mind of one of those crazy, crutch using, mentally ill people that subscribe to harmful belief systems. 



So all of that to say thank you to Reddit for all of your informative articles, studies and information on the variety of subjects that serve to challenge belief systems and why we do what we do. Also, I wanted to let you know hope isn't lost. People can change.

He clearly has a lot of fans. I used to be one, and I'd like to count myself as one again.  But first I need him to answer a question for me:

What's the deal with Activeion?

Activeion is the allegedly pseudoscientific cleaning product that Nye hawked a couple years ago. It was a special spray bottle whose inventors claimed would transform pure water so that it would clean better than regular water, and without any chemicals. It used a process that skeptics claimed was as good as snake oil: First, Activeion charges tap water with electricity, and then transforms it by passing it through ""an ion exchange membrane, creating an oxygen-rich mixture of positive and negative nano-bubbles... The ionized water now attracts dirt like a magnet and lifts it from the surface, enabling it to be easily wiped away.""

An Activeion bottle cost anywhere from $169.00 per bottle to $329.00.

Nye starred in a video on their website explaining how it supposedly works and also sat on the company's board of directors (although it has been suggested that this may have been part of their endorsement agreement and not a formal directorial position).

Here's the video. See if anything he says makes scientific sense to you: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMAEArFmdd4

At some point, Nye seemed to have become disassociated with the company. The video no longer was on their website, and he was no longer listed on their board. Today the company seems to have gone out of business and their website isn't even around anymore (it used to live at http://www.activeion.com). Their Facebook page seems to be abandoned, and their Twitter account is gone. But you can see what their site [once looked like](http://web.archive.org/web/20100410160522/http://www.activeion.com/science/default.aspx) via the Wayback Machine.

A [discussion at the Skepticblog](http://www.skepticblog.org/2010/04/22/bill-nye-selling-out-to-the-man/) suggests that Nye may have been in need of money, and so he sold out to pseudoscience in order to make a buck and then get back to teaching real science. 

(That post also links to other sites with information about ""ionized water"" scams).

What I want to know is: what really happened? How did this man, a science hero for so many, become the salesman for alleged snake oil? Is there real science behind it? Does he still stand behind it? Did he ever really believe in it? Does he have an excuse? Did he just need the money?
Because I have to say, ever since I learned about this, I just can't get excited about Bill Nye any more, and I've tried. He seems to be back to doing good work, but I can't forget about Activeion. I want to see him as a hero in science education again, but I can't until I get some answers. We all make mistakes, and I could get past it, but I'd like to know if he considers this a mistake or the real deal.

Has anyone ever heard him talk about this? Does anyone know more about the story of Activeion and/or Nye's involvement?

Also, if he ever does an AMA and I'm not around to ask, someone please ask on my behalf. Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2qj8f,1342542863.0,,,True,t3_wphmg,http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/wphmg/if_bill_nye_ever_does_do_an_ama_this_is_the_one/,

This is my first post on reddit, and I deliberately searched for a skeptical subreddit so I could talk about what happened today.

I should start off with the backstory; a couple of months ago, my flatmate at uni hung herself.
As you can imagine, being one of the people who saw her and tried to ""fix"" her, I've been in absolute emotional hell since then. 
My flatmates have been in hell as well.

We've moved out since then and are finding a new life for ourselves, and I finally felt like I'd received as much closure as I could - until we got a message from a ""psychic"".

My best friend in the house has a mother who knows someone who ""contacted"" the girl, and I was asked very seriously if I wanted to hear what the woman said because she's been ""incredibly accurate in the past"".

Obviously, scientifically, there's a lot I can say about this. Barnham effect, cold reading, etc. I want to focus, however, on how emotionally fucked up this is.

This woman is using an unfalsifiable pile of claptrap on a situation which is very real and upset us in a very real way.
She may mean well and genuinely believe she's talking to her... but why is she anyway? 
Did she know her?
Is she affected by the death?

I don't believe in paranormal activity in the SLIGHTEST, and it's even made me upset. I haven't asked what the ""psychic heard"" because it will unnecessarily upset me and will simply cloud my judgement of the life I've just become happy in.

What are your thoughts?

Instead of a historically accurate version of history they are presented with an epic space tale about how the Pilgrims and Indians are really aliens fighting a war over the stuffing mines.  Throughout the show they take shots at History's lack of credibility including making up bogus references for the ""experts"".

He spends about half an hour to forty minutes teaching the public about science and speculation.  It's pure gold.

Needless to say, the quote is bunk. The OP admitted as much [4 days after the fact](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/14nrf8/the_most_important_characteristic_of_a_good/c7hdcy0?context=3) [[archive if deleted](http://i.imgur.com/zCL9b.jpg)].

*So what; who cares? We can't be expected to fact check everything - that would be unreasonable. Besides, it's a decent qoute; does it really matter who said it?*

Well, yes. Forget for a second that it's slightly embarrassing, it mischaracterises Randi; it's just not like him to single out 'young people'.

We purport to be skeptics. We claim not to take things at face-value without evidence. If this tells us anything, it's that we shouldn't let our collective guards down - even in a community of skeptics.

I have a large, mixed immediate family.  Steps, halves, you name it, we've got it.  All of my 6 sisters, as well as my step mother are firm believers in psychic mediums.  For as long as I can remember, they have gone for readings, and it has often been a hot topic of conversation at family get togethers.  I was a skeptic from any early age, and always thought that their beliefs were silly, but harmless.  And then, three years ago, my father died.

Now, I'm not quite as civil when these discussions come up.  I get extremely upset by the fact that perfect strangers are taking thousands of dollars from my loved ones, and putting words into my dead father's mouth.  Whenever I express my skepticism, I'm treated as a hostile element in an otherwise blissfully ignorant family.  I never thought that I would say this, but psychics are driving my family apart.

I get upset when they talk about what my dead father has allegedly been ""saying"" from beyond the grave when he ""comes though"" to them.  They get upset when I ask them not to talk about it around me.  I'm starting to feel like an alien.  Has anybody had a similar experience, and if so, can you please offer some advice?  I'm having a lot of trouble with this. 

TL;DR:  I'm a skeptic and my entire family believes strongly in psychic mediums.  It's staring to create tension because every time I see them, they all talk about what my dead father has been saying. 

EDIT:  Wow, I never expected that this would get so much attention.  Thanks for all of the great advice.  Cutting them off is not an option for me, but I've certainly gotten some great ideas about how to approach the subject diplomatically.  Thanks r/skeptic, you guys rock!

UPDATE: Ok guys, first off thanks for the support! Anyway, I confronted this guy with some topics you guys gave me and guess what?! He admitted he was being irrational. I basically went up to him and told him that science isn't just information out of a book and can be replicated and shown to be true (unlike religion). I also told him that there are scientists that are Christian and believe in both science AND Christianity. I made him repeat what he believed out loud and I could see it in his face that after he said it he was a little thrown off by how stupid it sounded out load. Basically, he admitted that his belief that all scientists were conspiring in order to brain wash the masses into not believing in God was a bit ludicrous but still kept insisting that Science can't disprove his beliefs. I feel as if I've made some progress with him, but I'm still going to continue to make him think in subtle ways without being overly confrontational.

So, Christer Fuglesang, the first and only swede in space, decided to during the Almedalen (Politics) Week, to commit a collective suicide in the middle of a plaza. How? By swallow a full bottle of homeopathy medicine.

During the video above, he says that ""This is his third attempt to leave the life on earth."" (referring to his space travels and if I don't remember wrong, the first attempt to go to space failed)

later, the interveiwer asks, ""What if you die later, how to you want to be remembered?""

CF answares:

""As the first swede in space.""

(no shit sherlock)

The reason why he does this, (as told in the title) is to prove to the Riksdagen (the swedish parlament) and the swedish people that Homeopathy is bullshit, and doesn't work at all.

Is he crazy, or is he awesome? or a bit of both?

    Reporter: One of the big events here in Almedalen, during this thursday, that'll soon be held: 
    Sweden's only astronaut, Christer Fuglesang, will soon participate in a mass suicide attempt. 

    Christer Fuglesang: One could say that it's my third attempt to leave this life upon earth, 
    however I am afraid that I will fail blatantly. 

    [Screen: The Swedish Skeptics' Association organizes a mass suicide attempt]
    [Screen: They will themselves swallow a large dose of homeopathic medicine]

    Christer Fuglesang: The reason I am doing this is to show the public, and even politicians, 
    that alternative treatments, especially homeopathic medicines, are completely ineffective. 

    [Fuglesang swallows the dose of homeopathic medicine]

    Reporter: It seems like you survived. How do you feel?
    Christer Fuglesang: Just as I did before, I'd say; No difference. 
    Reporter: In the event that you had died, how would you like Sweden to remember you?
    Christopher Fuglesang: Like Sweden's first spaceman, of course. ",,False,self,t5_2qj8f,True,,,True,t3_ij8t6,http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ij8t6/the_first_and_only_swedish_astronaut_tries_to/,

Furthermore, there is so much ad hominem in that thread, it's incredible. She came onto the site to talk about what she does, and instead of kindly disagreeing and giving a well reasoned argument, there are fallacies everywhere.

I've seen a lot of posts and comments that don't do anything productive to help promote critical thinking and end up hurting the cause more than anything and most importantly, violate [Wheaton's Law](http://ruleoftheinternet.com/).

A lot of what I've noticed is people actively going about looking for fights about pseudoscience and alternative medicine. As [threetoast](http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/w0pvo/got_banned_from_a_facebook_group_for_pointing_out/c59agog) pointed out, this kind of self congratulatory circlejerk makes /r/skeptic into nothing more than a small version of /r/atheism where all we do is tell each other how smart we are and how stupid everyone else is.

I know how frustrating it is to see people, especially ones you care about, buying into things you know are non-factual. What we need to do is figure out how to show them without pushing them further into their beliefs. It's been well shown that when a strongly held belief is attacked or criticized it puts the person who holds that belief into a defensive posture that only reinforces the strength of that belief. This is even worse when the belief is shaped by the persons worldview rather than simple misinformation (think about how people treat the naturalistic fallacy). We can't just go about telling people that they're wrong and throwing facts at them waiting for them to see the light and come over to our side. People don't work that way, our emotions take over and logic doesn't always prevail.

Instead of just criticizing what I've seen, I'd like to discuss how we *can* make a difference. 

* Make sure people know you're a skeptic, not a cynic or a smartass or the asshole who always has an opinion on things, but a skeptic. This can be hard and a lot of the time it means holding your tongue when you really want to talk.
* Don't look for a fight, you'll never win. If you really want to convince someone, they have to be open to being convinced. A lot of this is waiting for them to come to you and ask your opinion. They're only going to do this if you follow the first rule.
* Activism: It's a good thing if you do it right. Don't go around vandalizing products you don't like or picking fights on facebook. We need to make sure companies know it's not ok for them to sell alternative medicines that don't work, or advertise for anti-vax groups, but we need them to make them change.
* Try to help people understand critical thinking and let the pieces fall into place. Give them resources or make them available. A realization that someone has on their own will be a lot more powerful than one they have because someone shouted it enough until they started to believe it.
* As a said above, Wheaton's Law: Don't be a dick. It makes the rest of us look bad.

I hope we can use this discussion to create a community that will really help us advance critical thinking. I know I could've written a lot more here, but I'm hoping others will speak up and share their own thoughts.

The Psychic Nikki segment starts at around 48 minutes into the show.

So far her excuses include

* Randi is using her for publicity
* Randi doesn't have a million dollars
* She has no interest in his money
* She has nothing to prove to him
* The test is controlled
* The test is somehow fraudulent or flawed
* Randi is a skeptic (yes that was one of her reasons to avoid the test and James Randi)
* Skeptics are losers
* She somehow thinks the challenge is for medians not psychics like her
* She has no time

She's gone on to make some bold predictions so far with her psychic abilities, such as:

* Randi might get ill.
* There will be an earthquake on the US East coast
* A big hurricane in Florida next year!!!!111!! Wowzers
* Ice caps will melt!
* [A large baseball field sized asteroid will pass by the Earth](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/)
* Packer fans will get married on a football field in uniform blah blah blah.
* A spaceship/UFO from another planet will land on Earth within the next 10+ years or some stupid shit like that which is far off enough into the future nobody will remember her prediction flopped.",,False,self,t5_2qj8f,True,,,True,t3_ka0nf,http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ka0nf/psychic_nikki_currently_butthurt_on_the_dean/,

Rejoice fellow skeptics! There's a little more light in the darkness.

Mom doesn't know much about science mostly because she dropped out of high school in the 10th grade when she got pregnant with me. So naturally she finds a lot of things to be mystical/spiritual. She made an offhand comment last night about how it's strange that every year her birthday &amp; my birthday always fall on the same day of the week. So I tell her it's probably a pretty common thing &amp; that if any two dates are separated by a certain number of days that this will probably always happen.

Then the HYPOTHESIS: I tell her it probably comes down multiples of seven. That any time two dates are separated by a number of days that's a multiple of seven, they'll fall on the same day of the week. 

Testing the Hypothesis: So we add up the number of days between her birthday &amp; mine &amp; it comes out to 42! (HA! Thank you Douglas Adams!)

Then came the title of my post and I say ""You see, we observed a phenomenon, examined the evidence, contructed a hypothesis, tested the hypothesis and found it to be correct. That's science."" Then she asks me what a hypothesis is &amp; I give her a brief definition. I could tell she'd never heard these things before. I think she may have learned a little something &amp; that makes me very happy. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER!

Without being too confrontational I have commented on some of their posts, usually pointing out specific inaccuracies and mis-information.  I've often wondered what our local medical professionals think of their campaign, and how they are responding to it.  Today a local pharmacist commented:

It was one of those Powerband ([this brand to be exact](http://www.powerbalance.com/)) bracelet scams.  I was surprised at first, but realized I did live in Utah where the general public do believe in much crazier stuff than silicon bands with holograms giving them special powers (like underwear giving them special powers for example).

I walked by not wanting to waste my time, but than the guy running the kiosk asked me if I had taken their free test yet.  It was at this point I decided that I would have some fun.  So I told him ""no"" and he preceded in pitching his ""magic bracelet"" to me.  

He asked me a few leading questions such as, ""do you always feel tired?"" and, ""do you wish you had better power and balance when you play sports?""  Of course the answers for these questions for nearly everyone is yes, so I played along.  He than continued to explain that ""all these problems and more can be fixed by wearing the Power-Balance Bracelet.""   I pretended to be excited.  He than asked me to balance on one foot and hold my arm out.  He than did the well known parlor trick of pushing on my arm and throwing me of my balance.  Next he had me put on one of his bracelets and repeat the test.  Wouldn't you know, this time he was unable to push my arm down, even with all his strength.  It was also at this time an audience started forming.  I acted very amazed and decided it was time for the trolling to begin.

I first asked him if his company had talked to the Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm?  Not sure what I was getting out he said no.  I then preceded explaining to him that his bracelet defied the laws of physics and thermodynamics and that the creator of such a bracelet should be rewarded a Nobel prize for such a ground breaking discovery.  

Confused he asked me, ""what do you mean breaks the laws of physics?""  I proceeded to tell him that balance has to do with the rotation around a center of mass and that a flimsy silicon bracelet wouldn't add enough mass to aid in balance and that in mammals it's the canals of the inner ear that controls balance.  I further explained to him that energy cannot be created or destroyed and that wearing a hologram can in no way increase a persons energy.  

Another mall patron in the audience also chimed in saying that he heard it was a scam.  I than took the time to explain to the audience about applied kinesiology and the placebo effect.  The guy in the kiosk was quite upset with the whole ordeal and asked me to leave.  I obliged and was on my way.  

I didn't notice until I left, but the best thing about the whole thing is I was wearing [this shirt](http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts-apparel/xkcd/dae9/?cpg=froogle).",,False,self,t5_2qj8f,True,,,True,t3_ihj8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ihj8z/so_i_trolled_the_powerband_kiosk_guy_in_the_mall/,

Basically, I contacted the FFRF for a religious violation in my public school  with one teacher a while back. They took care of that, however there is one thing that has not been addressed (I guess because it is out of their realm). My AP Anatomy &amp; Physiology teacher (the same teacher I reported to the FFRF) promoted anti-vaccine ideas in class and outwardly stated that vaccines cause autism. She handed out [this](http://dprogram.net/2009/12/15/forced-vaccinations-government-and-the-public-interest-dr-russell-blaylock/#more-26259) in the form of a packet to the entire class in addition to that. When I pointed out that the CDC says the opposite of what she was saying, she said I was wrong. Another student asked ""Wait, really?"" in response to the autism thing and she said ""Yeah, there have been studies."" Most of the class believed her. She has also spread other incorrect information around the class, such as the infamous ""blood is blue"" line, and the fairly forgivable and harmless yet still incorrect ""you eat 7 spiders in your sleep"" spiel. /r/skeptic, this is a college level anatomy course in a public high school. This shouldn't be happening. I'm 100% sure she would defend her beliefs if questioned about them and she will most likely promote the same thing next year as we spent a day on it.

I still have the packet, though it is a little crumpled from sitting on my desk for several months. My dad told me to look at the SGU's links page but I didn't really find anything there that would help me. What I'm asking is.. who do I contact about this? My dad is pissed that she's spreading lies and I'm pissed because, well, that's a shitty thing for a teacher to do. If we have to hire an attorney I guess that would be alright but I think an established corporation or what have you backing us up would be better than that. I am not afraid to put my name out there as I am a very well respected student but I'd rather let the people who know what they're doing handle it, you know?

edit: I should add that I had this teacher last year and will not have her again for a class. So I can't do anything in class as there is no longer one. ",,False,self,t5_2qj8f,1345459873.0,,,True,t3_yhlod,http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/yhlod/how_to_handle_a_teacher_that_is_antivaccine/,

http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/12erm3/i_love_this_article_and_i_want_to_believe_its/c6v101a?context=9 - this guy. He seemed to get really offended when I suggested that a simulated universe does not require a creator or 'god'. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/13edwx/nikola_tesla_free_energy/c73m7ym - this guy appears to trust the conspiracy theorists just because of the 'hundreds' of videos on Youtube.

Has anyone else noticed this? Or is it just me and my selective exposure to this subreddit?


**edit** to paste this here: 

&gt;I suppose my original intent with this was to highlight the variety of readers we get in here, and to say we may need to be a little more responsible in how we conduct discussions. By that I mean, this subreddit, at the moment, is more focused on pointing+laughing at the conspiratards. Perhaps we need to embrace and educate instead.

Here are some responses that my dad and I sent..

Edit:

###My cousin just sent me this message

&gt;HI Alex,
Fresh water diatoms are used in the food grade DE. It’s around 97% AMORPHOUS silica… crystalline silica is the one that causes silicosis (and I believe must be regulated by OSHA). It is not FDA approved, but has been investigated in a limited manner in terms of lowering cholesterol (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9533930). 

&gt;DE has been used as a dewormer in livestock for sometime and is often supplemented in their feed, though it is only recently that studies with the right controls have been performed to investigate this use (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21673156?dopt=Abstract).

&gt;Silica is present as a trace, essential mineral in the body and is absorbed as silicic acid (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17435951). My dad is probably taking more than he should since the RDI of silica has not been established. The Food Standards Agency UK claims that intake of silica supplements less than 700 mg per day should not produce harmful side effects, though I am not sure what study they are basing that claim on. Based on the cholesterol study and on animal feed recommendations it seems that just under a gram a day is probably harmless and perhaps beneficial… I think he is taking twice that.

&gt;My only real concern regarding DE is a risk for kidney stones. 

&gt;Have a nice holiday break

She should quickly average 1/12.

I've had somewhat of a skeptical mind since I was about 18 (39 now), but for whatever reason, I seemed to have blinders on when it came to Dr. Oz at first.

Then last year, when I had a physical with my GP, she noted that I was overweight, and recommended I go and get a pedometer and aim for 10,000 steps a day, and I mentioned in passing ""oh yeah, I've heard Dr. Oz say that."". This caused my doctor to give me a bit of a dirty look, along with a ""yes, and now I'm saying it."". 

It bothered me a little that she would have that reaction, because she is a very patient, good-natured doctor with fantastic bedside manner and a well-respected clinic.  Was she offended that I would bring up the advice of another doctor, or was her derision directed toward Dr. Oz himself?

From that point, I started paying closer attention to what he said on his show.  Perhaps coincidentally, or perhaps because I was actually listening, I began to notice things.  Like how much homeopathic material was presented, like how expensive all the ""superfoods"" he was recommending are on supermarket shelves, like how he had John Edward on his show, and became ""convinced"" there was something to what he did.

Yesterday, he had a debate in his studio about whether food is addictive.  I had some problems with how he presented the debate, the main two are 1) a concensus on the definition of the word ""addictive"" was not established, and it was apparent by the fact that both parties seem to consider different definitions, and 2) Oz was acting as a moderator, but at the end of the segment it was obvious that he had his mind made up before the debate, and was giving advice about ""addictive foods"" by the end of the show.

This man is a medical doctor!  Aren't doctors supposed to be critical and science-minded?  Does he actually think like this, or is the show presented to attract an uncritical, sheeplike audience?

TL;DR: I used to respect Dr. Oz's opinion, but a talk with my own GP made me look at him more critically, and I no longer like or respect what I see.",,False,self,t5_2qj8f,False,,,True,t3_ole8m,http://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/ole8m/im_growing_to_despise_dr_oz/,

A few videos have been making the rounds on the takedown of Chris Dorner, the LA officer who's been the subject of a lot of scrutiny as of late being the victim of police arson of some sort. Most of the videos are audio transcripts of police/dispatchers discussing the incident as it happens. They refer to seven 'burners' being placed, and then a fire breaking out. Some commenters are claiming that the two are related. Others are claiming that 'burner' is a LAPD jargon term referring to tear gas. I can't honestly substantiate the later claim, nor would I jump to the conclusion of the first claim.

For reference: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_dorner
The various videos with transcripts are all over youtube.
Here's the audio that is currently running around on r/bestof and r/DornerCase:
https://archive.org/details/DornerStandoff2
There's other versions of this audio and other local tv broadcasts with audio as well... a plethora of them to wade through.

As a skeptic, I'm personally skeptical of the claim that the LAPD would burn someone alive, and I'm a bit concerned about the shockingly quick conclusion that the gestalt has jumped to regarding the incident, but I might be missing something important. I'm curious to know what everyone's thoughts are on this incident and the current reddit response to it.

Edit: Oh wow.. top post on r/Skeptic. Didn't see that one coming. Anyway..opinions still seem mixed, and there's a verdict of 'not enough info to make an informed decision on the matter' which seems to be the prevailing opinion. Thanks to everyone who added their two cents for a thoughtful discussion and dissemination of facts. I for one personally did not know that it was the local jurisdiction of San Bernardino that was responding and not explicitly the LAPD, so that at least was new info to me.
