I really hope to keep in touch, especially since I'm definitely going to need some guidance when I finally get the cajones to play Dota 2. Thanks everyone for a really great TI3!

Korea and even though they're adding server clusters, only Korean citizens can play the game because of Nexon's New User Policy (""no foreigners allowed"").  I've been trying to email Valve about this issue but I think I need help getting them to listen.",tagus,2095,567,432,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1abrti/hey_rdota2_im_an_american_in_s_korea_and_even/,"I want to be able to play on this &lt;10ms South Korean internet, but Nexon has a ""fuck foreigners"" policy when it comes to all of the games that they license/franchise, including DotA2.

Take for example League of Legends:  a South Korean company licensed the entire game and it's intellectual rights so that they could have their game servers (and client) completely independent of the main Riot Games' version of the game.  They mirror all of the changes that Riot Games makes with a week or so lag to translate everything into Korean and whatnot, but that's why you don't see ""Korea"" or ""한글"" in the server and language choices.  It's because they're both on a completely separate client and server cluster.

In fact, every game that becomes licensed and whatnot to South Korea does it this way.  The game companies just basically copy/paste and ""Koreanize"" their game or whatever you want to call it, then allow only Korean citizens (people with the 주민 SSN) and prevent non-Koreans (people with the 외국인 SSN) and people who don't even have an SSN in general from playing or participating in their games.

Nexon, yes, is one of the biggest game companies in Korea, probably on the scale of Valve or EA or whatever relatively speaking... but they have a very bad policy when it comes to foreigners.  Even though I have a 외국인 SSN in this country I cannot even make an account on their website!  (Oh, they'll let me register the account, but when it comes to the next step like on all sites: verifying the SSN, they say ""nope! sorry but foreigners are not allowed to play games on Nexon"")

This means no Kart Rider, no Maple Story, and pretty soon... no DotA 2. 

FAQ:

&gt;But... I heard that Korea had a law or something overturned so you don't have to check your Korean SSN anymore!

The're not doing away with the SSN thing.  The Supreme Court judgment here **only prevented the companies from *directly* asking for your Korean SSN.** The companies now just use your iPin (a government organization that verifies online identities via Korean SSN instead of giving it to them directly) to verify your identity (in this case, as with many of the game companies like Nexon, Blizzard for SC2, whoever owns the LoL franchise here - but not Pmang for some weird reason), which was always an alternative to using your Korean SSN anyway.

So that law overturning or whatever didn't change anything at all here.

&gt;Why not just play on the other regular DotA2 servers then? Fuck the Korean servers...

[This is why](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1aa88y/when_connecting_to_aus_servers_my_korean_internet/) (hint: when in korea, going to Korean sites is fast as fuck... but the second you try to connect to anything outside of korea... even if it's just across the sea over in China or Japan...

There was a Death Prophet playing who had nearly 600 wins and throughout the game all they did was complain about the Windrunner. The player who was playing Windrunner was a noob, they had 0 wins to their name and only about 40 battle points. The death prophet complained and asked everyone to report the Windrunner for feeding. To me this is unacceptable behavior from a player with nearly 600 wins, they should not be in this mode, the mode is designed as a training tool for NEW players. If you must have the sniper set then please go into that game mode with the intention of being forgiving and assume that you have a very good possibility of losing due to new players on your team, go in to that game mode and aim to teach these new players. It is not fair for you to stomp them and it is not fair for you to flame them for being bad at the game.

I'm sorry if the title was confusing. I'm more advocating that the watch button be enabled prior to completion of the tutorial**

Unless something has changed recently I'm pretty sure that in order to spectate games in DOTA 2 you have to complete some of the tutorial missions (please correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while!). With all of the interest stemming from the WCS incident as well as LoL players and players from other genres that may be intrigued, the tutorial should not be a prerequisite for viewing The International on the weekend it airs.

Essentially what I'm saying is that there may be many SC2 players and people who have never played DOTA that would like to watch The International, but aren't interested in having to complete a tutorial in order to do so.

If I'm wrong and this has been changed since tutorials were implemented, please feel free to downvote me to hell.

**Edit:** I understand that there ARE workarounds. However people that wish to view the competitive DOTA scene in order to decide whether or not the game is worth playing might not a.)  immediately see a tutorial and google how to enable the console merely to avoid the tutorial or b) be discouraged that they have to complete a tutorial for a game they aren't certain they want to play, simply in order to watch a tournament.

This isn't a post aimed at veteran DOTA players or people that know exactly what DOTA is, but rather those that have seen the hype and want to take a look at the game that has put $2.6 million on the line for a single tournament.

They are basically keeping each single game competitive by ignoring a lot of players needs of longterm stats and ranking. The latter being something most other games do cater to. 


I sincerely hope that Valve has something up their sleeve, which they most likely do (keeping in mind that the game is still in Beta and Valve is always about the end product seemingly regardless of the time it takes to get there) and that they will ultimately accommodate everyones need and not just those afraid of being scolded by bullies. 


*In the meantime* I have a BurNIng desire for them to implement teammatchmaking with added rankings. That would be one way of at least appeasing the competitive souls of those sociable enough to gather a team of five to play against other premade lineups. 


Seeing how fast they reacted on the previous matter, I thought I'd go out of my way to please my own selfish needs and see what the community thought about it. I figured Reddit would be better for this cause rather than TL.net as everyone is somehow represented on these boards and the userbase is bigger. My ulterior motive is of course that Valve implements this within a weeks time.

I feel somewhat nervous as this is my first time to write a post on DOTA 2 community.




My name is Chae Jung Won (aka Mr.Chae) and I am in charge of eSports at GOMTV in Korea.

Those of you who enjoyed StarCraft II may know already, that we have been providing English commentary and stream of numerous eSports contents produced in Korea for the benefit of oversea viewers.

We have been broadcasting SC II and World of Tank league and fans all around the world are enjoying our contents.

In addition to this, we will be producing eSports contents through DOTA 2 which is gaining huge popularity around the world.

Out first league will be NSL which will launch on July 6th at 1PM KST.

This is a league in which Korean publisher of DOTA 2, Nexon and GOMTV are hosting together, and in addition to Korean commentary, we will also provide English and Chinese commentary.

DOTA 2 scene in Korea is in a beginning stage yet, and there is gap in experience with teams that participate and win awards at The International.

However, I have faith that once DOTA 2 officially launches in Korea, many new tournaments will spring and Korean teams will improve fast in skill.

You may not be able to see many Korean teams in coming The International, but look forward to 2014 to see them.
(Foreign teams be prepared :p)

The reason I am writing this post today, is to provide guide to our first DOTA 2 contents, NSL, which many oversea viewers are showing interest, on how to watch it.

The champion of this NSL, will gain the right to participate in DOTA 2 The International in August.

NSL is not an online event, but an offline event held at GOMTV Studio in Korea. To experience not just the matches between teams, but also interview from players and the heat of the scene, have our [Korean commentary channel](http://www.twitch.tv/gomtv_en) open as well as the English channel.

Please show interest to GOMTV’s first DOTA 2 event, and we shall continue to provide you high quality contents and work to develop DOTA 2 scene in Korea. 

If you have any questions feel free to contact me any time: parapa@gretech.com

I am also going to The International in August, with the winning team. 

See you all at Seattle.

Thank you!

Turns out that there's some bandwidth throttling that TWC does to cache servers that host video content for web services (YouTube, Netflix, twitch.tv, etc.).


To get around this, you can block the following IP ranges (Windows Firewall, ipfw in Linux):


173.194.55.0/24

206.111.0.0/16


By blocking these addresses, the videos will be served to you directly instead of being throttled by the ISP. You can read more info about it [here](http://mitchribar.com/2013/02/time-warner-cable-sucks-for-youtube-twitchtv/). It should have some more detailed information and links to some videos and tutorials for Windows, OSX, and Linux.

**Also I am not talking about the whole nation of Russia, just the ones who queue on EU West with English selected as a language when in actual fact they cannot speak English. It's this specific group of Russians that many people in this thread can testify against, it is giving me (false?) impressions on the rest of Russia.**

**I am also aware the Americans have a similar issue with Brazilians, though that does not affect me personally.**

I used to think Russians were pretty cool, after seeing all of their antics on LiveLeak and stuff, but playing with them in games is the biggest drag. I choose West Europe exclusively as the server I play, and it seems to be infested with East Europeans and Russians (Russia is technically East Europe I know, but they even have a Russian server!).

I'm pretty pissed so I've devised a list of why I think there needs to be action against the Russian plague, all of these that follow are sweeping generalisations based on my brief 200 hour experience of the game:

- On the whole, their computers seem to be pretty poor, most of the time when I'm waiting for someone to load it will be a name full of Russian symbols. Often they never even manage to load and we have to return to searching.
- They have lag and d/c a lot, probably because of the server location relative to their own.
- They spam chat with Russian symbols which hinders communication for the entire team, yes West Europe has multiple languages within it, but a lot of the people from places like Germany that I encounter seem to speak good English anyway, and the problem is overcome.
- They seem to rage more than any other nationality I encounter, either that or the words 'report' and 'cyka' are compliments.
- When you ask them why they don't play on their own servers, the answers incite rage and are often as simple as ""because I don't want to"".

Now, to emphasize, **these are generalisations**, I've met nice Russians too, but very very rarely.

Dota 2 is a **team game**, I select English as my language but somehow I get matched up with эти гребаные идиоты 8/10 times.

It would come as no surprise to me if numerous new players get put-off of Dota simply because they have a bad experience playing with Russians in one of their first games.[1](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1bwyd6/this_game_is_making_me_really_racist/c9awhk5?context=3)[2](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1bwyd6/this_game_is_making_me_really_racist/c9ayuso?context=3)

Now, when I refer to Russians, I of course don't mean everyone living in the country of Russia. I am specifically referring to those individuals who choose servers outside of their region and/or language. This has a knock-on effect because sometimes I have to go against *my own principles* and play outside of *my* region. I have picked US servers a couple of times because of poor European games, because there's a higher chance of my language being spoken.

**I don't know whether this post is a repeat, or whether it is over-the-top, but I frequently see comments in this sub and elsewhere in Dota that support my views, I would like to hear what the consensus of the community is on this issue.**

Thanks. (tl;dr, sick of Russians picking English)

Anyone who is colorblind, or just interested should have a look.
Here is a Link: http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/17dob2/colorblind_mode_seriously_valve/c84nrb2**

Last year, in May, I made a suggestion to Valve on the dev forums for Colorblind Mode. There was an option for it way back when in the options menu. It did nothing, but they were at least thinking about accessibility. This issue means something to me as, while I am not colorblind, one of my best friends is.

He's Red-Green colorblind to a degree that he is almost incapable of distinguishing friend from foe without dedicating valuable time to making the distinction. Put shortly, he pretty much can't play because of it. However, it's not just my friend. Red-Green Colorblindness is an exceptionally common defect in men (the primary Dota demographic), at approximately 7% of all men having some kind of deficiency. (http://www.hhmi.org/senses/b130.html)

So, maybe it's a little selfish of me, because I'm primarily motivated by a desire to play with this friend, but if any of you could please visit the dev forums and show your support in the thread I made about this issue, I would be grateful, and hopefully Valve would see how badly this is needed.

First of all, let me introduce myself. My name is Daniel, I'm a 21 years old student, and this is my last semester. I'm studying economy informatics, and I'm writing my thesis on e-sports (I focus on the business models and being involved with e-sports as a job). We have to do a research, and I decided to do interviews. So, **if you are a professional gamer** (and by professional, I mean making money out of it, doesn't matter if salary, prize money or sponsorship or even bigger donations), **known streamer, shoutcaster, or manager** of a gaming organization or league, please contact me if you'd like to help me. If you are not a pro, but want to help me, an upvote will do (selfpost=no karma). I'd prefer to do the interview via skype or other voicechat program, but emails will do if we can't find time for a live interview. Sadly I'm not too familiar with the current scene, so I have to rely on upvotes or ask for some proof (sorry). If you are worried abbout sensitive personal information, I can assure you that I will classify my thesis. I've been trying to find interviewees via other methods, but I haven't succeeded, so this is my last resort, any help will be appriciated. Thank you for taking your time to read this.

Have a nice day/evening!

1359194569.0,1112,self.DotA2,17b655,Let's talk about what this rage about yet another data mining website is implying.,SeriousLagg,1519,407,759,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/17b655/lets_talk_about_what_this_rage_about_yet_another/,"**Edit:** Please read [this definition](http://catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html) before going any further.

First and foremost. What I'm about to say does not reflect the opinions of staff and all other editors on the Dota 2 wiki, naturally.

Now. I was trying very hard to simply ignore this and not add to the mess. But after reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/17awec/im_really_trying_to_get_past_all_this_dotabuff/) thread I must at least express my opinion in the hopes of making some people understand how insane the level of delusion is right now.

The fact is: In this day and age where companies like Facebook are trying every single trick they can to get people to give up more of their personal lives and information. Valve has actually done something that works in **our favor** and yet are getting demonized for it.

Let me repeat this again. **Valve**, a **multi-million dollar corporation**, have added privacy settings that stop websites from getting your statistics. On top of that. They have this setting **enabled by default**. Yet, they are being spammed, called out, threatened, and worse for not reverting it entirely.

Why are people in such a hurry to have their data mined? I am willing to bet that at least some of those doing this spamming are the same people who sign petitions and voice disapproval at Facebook's actions.

I have been a programmer for more than a decade, it is how I make my living, I license all my personal code under a permissive license, I wrote OPTF2, and I am an avid fan of reverse engineering and encourage it whenever possible if it is not harmful. So please take this seriously when I say it:

It is still entirely possible to gather statistics on people who consent via an official and sanctioned API. Dotabuff's aim was to become some sort of juggernaut and make money on people. There is no elegance or respect for the community and the hacker mindset in their actions. It was a simple attempt to become **the** statistic website, with no regard for anything or anyone else. On top of that, when people try to rationalize their actions by explaining that they need the money for hosting (which they are fans of doing, even in their latest news post regarding invested money). 90% of the time they are lying or otherwise exaggerating the actual expenses. OPTF2 was brought down by load on more than one occasion. Yet I continue to run it completely out of pocket (having just recently introduced donations) for four years. I would have it no other way, because in my projects everyone gets the same quality, and that includes no advertisements.

These people like the genius mentioned in that thread have been egged on by a news post by said website that basically tells people to act in a lynch mob fashion and blame Valve (and **Icefrog** no less who may not even be on the team that made this decision!) and are in other words being good professional victims. They have even went so far as to list icefrog's email address and a direct link to the contact form on Valve's website.

Again, the authors of dotabuff are egging people on by encouraging them to spam employees at Valve, including Icefrog. Who may not have even been involved in the decision and implementation for the privacy setting. Resulting in a company being demonized for adding a privacy feature for their users that is **on by default**, something very rare for companies exposing data these days. And they are buying it with little complaint. I implore you to see the fundamental wrongness in this and not buy their crap.",Discussion,False,,t5_2s580,1359221636.0,,d2w,True,t3_17b655,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/17b655/lets_talk_about_what_this_rage_about_yet_another/,

Someone at Valve took notice of the outrage everyone here expressed here on /r/dota2 and when we brought the issue to the Dev forums enough people joined in on the ""wtf nexon"" circlejerk to get them to convince Nexon to finally allow foreigners to play DotA 2.

**AND THE FUN DOESN'T STOP THERE!**

Foreigners^with ^a ^외국인등록번호, ^aka ^a ^KSSN can now also play ALL of Nexon's games! THAT'S RIGHT!

Recently NASL has been really burned in their home turf of Starcraft 2 by not getting any piece of the huge WCS pie. Now is by far the best time to attract them into DOTA 2.  They have some of the highest production quality of any esports organizer in the world and have improved leaps and bounds over the years.  

Rotterdam, while not the best, has experience casting and playing dota*, and the others seem to be learning, even if their heart is more into SC2.

I also want to say all of you guys that are bitching about it, why? Just go play normal matches then or don't take it so seriously, try different heroes and strategies. Maybe one or two things I would say would make it a little better would be to make it RD instead of AP, or CM.

1346006714.0,968,self.DotA2,yv2id,Thanking Valve for how much effort they have put into Dota 2 especially as an e-sport.,Kinths,1203,235,216,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/yv2id/thanking_valve_for_how_much_effort_they_have_put/,"I'd like to say thanks to Valve for just how much effort they have put into Dota 2. Especially on the E-sport side of things. Valve have done pretty much everything possible to not only support Dota 2 as an e-sport but also to support the players.

TL;DR Just me explaining some problems with current e-sports then me gushing over and thanking valve for just how much Valve is doing to fix those problems with Dota 2.

Full essay version:
So firstly before getting to it, I would like to point out some things that not everyone may know. Being a professional gamer isn't as glamorous as it sounds, nor does it pay well. Many of the players you love, watch and support don't get a steady wage. Their income mainly comes from streaming views and tournament prizes, if they lose they will often get nothing or next to it. Now you may see some of these tournament prizes and be thinking wow that's a lot of money to win. But it often isn't, with the exception of the International most prize funds are pretty low. Remember that the pot gets split between at least 5 people and that money has to last them till they next win money. Not a lot of teams pay for travel costs or living expenses either and sponsors often just give players free gear instead of money. Until they win these players are often working (yes it is a job to them despite how fun you may think it would be) for free.
 

With that out of the way let me get to the point.
Any one who has watched or played competitive LoL (I know it's a dirty word around these parts) will likely know that there is a bit of a  problem within the scene. Some teams are refusing to play games unless they can also stream the games on their own channel. This is because streaming provides a more stable and guaranteed income than tournament prizes.But it takes away viewers from the tournaments official stream meaning they likely can't offer a bigger prize pool next tournament. This becomes a viscous cycle to the point where prize funds will likely get to small for smaller tournaments to attract teams. The players are right for wanting to make money while they play and not just if they win, but the tournament hosts also need to make money to keep the tournaments going. The prize fund has to be  worth the teams time to participate but they also need a fall back plan if they lose.

So how does this relate to DotA 2. Well with Dota 2 valve is doing everything in their power to not only make it an e-sport, but also making it a stable e-sport that can easily grow exponentially, that supports Players, tournaments, teams and viewers.

We have the utterly brilliant in game spectator client, which lets thousands of people watch the game from within game (no more stream lag  or terrible quality) with full commentary. Because this is taking viewers away from streams Valve charges for fairly cheap tickets to watch the tournament with a good percentage of the money going to the tournament hosters, which likely gives them a better overall profit than the adverts on streams do.

We have modifiable team banners that allow teams to show off their sponsors from within the game, they don't detract from the game at all and keeps the team's sponsors happy.

We also have the ingenious new pennant system that gives money to  teams regardless of if they win and lets normal players support their team while having a chance at rewards just for watching, giving people even more incentive to watch. It also gives players more incentive to enter online tournaments that don't allow streaming in the future (Individual player streaming will become much much bigger once the game is properly released) 

Valve has created an e-sport where everybody profits and  it's something that can exponentially grow. The more viewers they get the more the teams earn which means they can make it to more tournaments meaning we get more chances to support our favourite teams while getting loot. Tournaments will make more money as the more viewers there are the more tickets will likely sell. Offering bigger prize pools to players and making it more worth their time. Bigger prize pools will then attract more viewers. It's a repeating cycle that promotes growth for everyone and takes some of the risk out of being an e-sports team, player or tournament hoster.

I really don't think people have realised just how big and innovative the features in DotA 2 are for e-sports. E-sports games are starting to get more views than ""real"" sports games and Valve has taken that to heart and created Dota 2 a game that fully embraces the e-sport side of the game. While making it much easier for those who haven't discovered how great e-sport can be to discover just how great it is.

So from Me to Valve: THANK YOU for making something that will hopefully set the standard for e-sports in the future. I always knew Dota 2 would be good but I never expected it to be quite so fully featured. Keep up the awesome work.

It seems that quality of twitch varies heavily on the location of the client. In short, some people watch lag-free (like I did a year ago) and some people can't watch twitch at all. Twitch offers an incredibly unreliable service.

1346700189.0,899,self.DotA2,zaliu,So you watched TI2 and now you want to play Dota 2. Here is where to start.,Kinths,1116,217,222,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/zaliu/so_you_watched_ti2_and_now_you_want_to_play_dota/,"So I've seen a few of these crop up of late. People who have watched the TI2 but are a little confused on where to start with DotA2. This is a few tips just to get you started and telling you where to look.

Firstly, Welcome to the community. We don't care who you were before, whether it be a SC2 player, LoL player or one of Banes henchman in TDKR. We are happy that you are here now (Well as long as you're a nice person and not an asshat) Please be courteous to others and make the points of any discussion you may end up in without insulting the other person/s. If you want a better gaming community then it starts with you. Remember that there is nothing to lose in Dota 2 so no need to rage and flame when you are losing. Take a breath and compose yourself. If you rage,flame and think ""trolling"" is cool then frankly we don't want you in our community, I doubt any that any gaming community does want that sort of person.

Secondly to clear up something that seems to be confusing a few people.
Dota 2 is currently in beta and missing some big features (Ie a tutorial) this can be a bit confusing to some considering they're holding big tournaments that hit huge viewer numbers for it already.

To actually play the game you need a Beta key. Here are your options:

1. You can buy one from the Dota 2 store http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/57939587 (which comes with some items for heroes and a spare key to gift or trade to someone)  Don't get it mixed up with the invitational key. That is for something else.

2. Sign up and hope to win the beta key lottery http://blog.dota2.com/ 

3. Find an a amazing person to trade you one http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/ (Don't beg for a free key, offer something in return)

4. Contests and giveaways, these are fairly sporadic but if you keep searching they start to pop up. The nice guys from Absolute Legends are doing a few give aways. All their reddit keys are gone I'm afraid but check this post to find where you could get some of the others they are giving away. http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/zbnwt/i_see_more_people_looking_to_play_dota_2_were/

Dota 2 will be free to play upon release. So whether you buy a key is whether you think it is worth it (Hint: it is!)


So you got yourself a beta key by succumbing to the evil and buying a Dota 2 key, by winning the lottery or offering Gabe sexual favours (I don't have a link for that one I'm afraid you will have to make your own advances, we wont judge) What do you do now ? 

Well you play ofcourse :) Start with bot games, going straight into PVP is just asking for people to hate you and the equivalent of painting a target on your back.The sidebar on the right of this Reddit offers plenty of useful links on getting started. Including item and hero guides, pure beginners guides to the Dota genre or for people coming from LoL. Be sure to check out the coaching system for more personal training and jump on our mumble server if you want to play or discuss the game. Here is a set of decent videos explaining the basics http://www.youtube.com/show/dota2learntoplay/videos?sort=dd&amp;flow=list&amp;page=1&amp;view=8

The game is even better if enjoyed with friends of a similar skill level, especially during the early learning stages.

Every hero in Dota 2 is available to everyone for free (or £20 if you bought an invite :P) Those coming from LoL may find choosing a hero at first a little overwhelming but just pick heroes you like the look of and play lots of bot games (You will likely find one similar to your favourite LoL hero) In Dota 2 the only thing you can buy with real money is cosmetic items for heroes (of which you still have a chance of randomly getting for free just by playing)

I hope this helps people, I tried to keep it as more of a simple directions post since most of the resources people are looking for are already here.

So welcome and good luck! :)

1348556715.0,893,self.DotA2,10fub9,Essentials of Dota: 7 Years of Dota Experience.,El_Fuego,1152,259,310,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/10fub9/essentials_of_dota_7_years_of_dota_experience/,"**What you are about to read is a foundation of Dota strategy that everyone can build on.** A lot of this is my opinion and I am by no means a professional player but I have a very good of understanding of the game. I will talk about things that carry over to every dota game and change very little from version to version. The hardest part about writing guides for Dota is its in a constant state of change. There are a lot of new players getting into the game and the big question is how do we make these players better before they even start their first game? I hope to solve that problem. So lets get started shall we?


**El_Fuego's Essentials of Dota**


* I want to start with something that allows for all the other ideas to build from. I've decided to start with vision because if you can't see you can't play.

**Vision:**

Vision is so important in Dota that professional teams designate heroes to provide it all game. Yet, even when playing with seasoned players it can sometimes be an afterthought. **If you don't have wards when the creeps spawn you are already losing the game.** 

* Anyone can and should buy wards. Please, avoid putting the burden on one hero. **The ward gold can and often times should be split among the team.** The idea behind this is that because you have vision, you make more gold, and the 300 spent on buying out the wards becomes less of a deficit. In short, **vision = more gold.** 

**NOTE:** I have many people saying ""Carries never buy wards!"" Yes, more often than not they don't, but that is with an organized team where roles are more concrete. The idea behind this concept is to make sure wards are always bought out and that the team is always provided with vision regardless of the team organization. Not everyone plays 5 stack Dota.

* If you are a new player the best thing you can do right away is buy wards and give them to someone who knows what to do with them. You an also ask them where to place the wards.

* Learn how line of sight works and you will instantly become a better dota player, you will gank/avoid ganks better, harass better, and be much harder to kill while being chased.

* If they pick a stealth hero have your team buy dust/sentries along with wards at start. Its costs a bit extra but when you first blood a stealth hero its going to be worth it.

* **Look at players items before you engage them.** Knowing what your enemy can do is essential to playing on a higher level.

**The map in the bottom left corner of your screen is the best ward you will ever have, it lasts all game, always gives you important information, and best of all its free**

**Ganking:**

Everyone loves to gank and no one likes to get ganked. **Ganking should happen in every lane at least once.** I have been in so many games where someone says ""You lost as X against Y? That matchup should never lose!""  Yet, the lane was never ganked and somehow its all X's fault. Take the lazy idea of looking at match ups as black and white and go gank the damn lane! **If someone needs a gank and you are perfectly capable of doing so, do it! By not doing so you are hurting your team. This is especially important for any heroes with a stun slow or disable!**

* Gank a lane where you know your teammate already has an upperhand. This seems counter intuitive but ganking a strong lane makes your enemy extremely weak and your teammate very strong. It wont be long till that lane snowballs out of control in your favor and you can move on to ganking a weaker lane.

* If the gank is lasting longer than 5 seconds you are setting yourself up for a counter gank. If the gank is successful go push to the tower but only if you have 2+ with you and they are strong pushers, otherwise get in and get out.

* Gank more at night. Players are less likely to see you and this gives you an upper hand. However, this can be a double edge sword because you also suffer from lack of vision. Ganking at night requires you to lock down a target quickly so they cannot juke out of it. Position yourself accordingly and move in. This brings me to the next essential part of Dota.

**Positioning:**

Positioning is what separates professionals from the rest of us. Learn it and learn it well because it is required in every game from the moment the creeps spawn to the moment the throne goes down. It is used in laning, ganking, team fighting, and farming. One can know every hero like the back of there hand but if they don't know positioning they don't know Dota. I will try to give tips but this is such a subtle concept that one can only get a true grasp of it by watching professionals and high level games. **Do you want to be a great Dota player? Make positioning your priority.**

* If there are no heroes on the mini map stop farming and get back. Stay out of your jungle and hug a tower because more than likely you are being hunted. This is very basic positioning but often times it is the most important and the most forgotten.

* Don't ever take the high ground without vision, EVER. Maybe you get away with it a for a while but one day you will pay the price and it may cost you the game.

* Teleport Scrolls are a must. **I often buy two so I always have one ready.** They allow you to do so many things, gank/countergank, push, escape, and save you so much time.

I am not going to explain team fight/gank positioning because they vary too much from game to game. If you want to get better at team positioning/ganking play AOE/Gank heroes and watch professional/high level games. also, watch Navi those guys know how to position so insanely well it almost won them a second TI2.

**Communication:**

If you don't have a mic you are actively choosing to weaken your Dota play. **Back during WC3 everyone had to type and ping. It was a communication nightmare and playing with people on any voice program was heaven on earth. Now that its built in people still don't use there mic, unbelievable!** Communication wins games, period. It can mean the difference between stopping or starting a successful gank, setting up a successful team fight, and giving enemy positions on the fly. One can discuss strategy instantly and with a game like Dota instantly is VERY important.

* Ping and call out a focus target**There is no such thing as too much communication in Dota.**

* Don't listen to music while playing Dota. There are too many sounds and indicators that help you stay out of danger as well as pull off successful team combos. You need to be able to hear your team so you can properly work together as a unit.

* Calling out lanes is important but don't forgot to call out key items. Do they have wards/sentries? Did enigma get a fast blink dagger? Who is buying Mecansm on the team?

* Talk to your team about everything. **If I am in a lane and I need my boots but I am giving farm to our carry all I have to do is ask for a few CS and usually they give it to me** Tell your team what you are building and ask them what they are building. The reason for this is you don't want to have two of certain items such as mechanism and pipe of insight.

**Composure:**

Dota is a psychologically and mentally taxing game. Everyone rages but not everyone knows how to control that rage. There are a lot mechanics/strategic expectations that cause emotions to spin out of control. I am going to point out those mechanics and show you that they aren't as big a part of the game as you may think. This is where I inject a bit of philosophy and psychology into my Dota play.

* **First Blood:** We all know the good ol' first blood it means you won or lost the lane right? Wrong. The moment a team lets first blood effect the outcome of a lane/game is the moment you lose the lane/game. What does that mean? **It means gank the guy who got first blood.** If you gank the guy who just got first blood it dampens the effect and gives you back some of what you lost. What if you can't get the guy? Learn from your mistake and avoid being caught in that position again. First blood will matter more if you let it matter because as the the game goes on it becomes less and less of an advantage so long as people don't die again and again. **First blood happens and it can often be because of mistakes but what you need to do is not dwell on the mistake, save that for watching the replay. Instead, ask yourself ""What can I do next do next?"" People make the second mistake after first blood by letting it go to their head which can snowball out of control.**

* **Laning:** Losing a lane does not equal losing the game.

* As a Dota player ALWAYS be prepared to lose your lane. Being prepared to only win your lane and never lose is not the mark of a good strategist **The moment you prepare for only one outcome is the moment you set yourself up for failure.**

* If you lose your lane try to have a different approach ready. It can be anything but make it involve your team with either a gank, push, or both. Hell, if you can convince your team to 5 man gank the lost lane and push it go for it. Five man Dota is a great way to bring your team back to the game instead of dwelling on lost lanes.

* **Live in the moment**
I am going to emphasize a bit more on dwelling on mistakes. Dota is not a game where you can focus on what happened in the past because it moves so quickly. Dwelling on the past and not focusing on the current moment in time can cause you to make more mistakes and eventually it turns into a downward spiral. If a mistake happens keep going because there is no time to discuss it as you are already having to deal with problems in the present for example what do you do after a mistake? Play through your mistakes.

* **Team Morale**
Dota players are their own worst enemies. The player raging, following your teammates every move, asking them if they even know how to play that hero? That player is losing you the game. Not the guy who just gave up 3 kills to X hero. **Public teams lose a lot because they implode from the inside.** Players don't know how to respond to mistakes and so it turns into rage. **Ragers are just lazy dota players who don't know how to play when they are losing.** Instead of helping the team out of a dire situation they decide instead to spit garbage the rest of the game. **Those minutes spent raging? Missed opportunities for ganks, comebacks, enemy over extension, pushes, farming, the list goes on.** How do I know this? I flamed people all the time back then because it was just part of the game. Eventually while watching replays trying to figure out what went wrong I realized I went wrong. Team morale is a MASSIVE part of Dota that is often never discussed when it should be one of the top priorities. When people feel good they make good decisions with sound judgment.

* What do we do with these players? **If you have a friend that rages consistently point it out, report,  and if it continues unfriend him and move on. Just like that you made the choice to have 0 tolerance for this kind of childish behavior.** Back then no one had accountability but now we have the report system. USE IT! People still don't use it enough. To me its one of the best things ever! I played Dota for years without any kind of justice system and now that its here its amazing. This must be a nine player effort to mute the rager and try to continue on with the game. EVERYONE must report these players not just the guy getting flamed at. If the rager is going to make a spectacle make him pay for it. When a 9 players report in a game he's thrown in with the rest of the children where he belongs.

That whole ""Thick skin"" mentality needs to die. You are no longer player WC3 Dota and now have a system that puts the children in there place. Absolutely no exceptions.

**Last Hitting/Denying/Farming**

If you get good at this you get more gold and they get less exp. I'm not going to explain the importance of this because its drilled into everyone's skull already. Don't get me wrong you will be a better Dota player for learning how farm well. Some take it too far, however, so I will leave you with this. **Farming is a mechanic within the game of Dota. Make sure you are playing in the game and not in the mechanic**

* **Big Farma'**

This is going to spark a lot of controversy and I didn't put it in the guide until I saw how popular it was. This is something I feel strongly about and it may cost me votes but it needs to be said.

**A carry is not a one trick pony for late game.** I like to think of a carry as a hero that is designated the most farm and is capable of providing spare gold in times of dire need. Yes, farming for the big items is very important but also leave yourself room to buy things for your team throughout the game just in case they can't get any gold. What do I mean by this? 8 minute battlefury is fantastic in fact its down right professional but that's an ideal and most games are never ideal. You have no wards and your supports can't afford them, spend the 150 gold. That 150 gold can turn into 2000 quite easily for you and give your comrades space to regain some map control and do what they need to support you.

**We often teach new players that a role is set in stone but we all know that Dota is a game of adapting. If we tell people that a role never has to do ""X"" we are not teaching players how to adapt!**


**Final words:**

I love this game and I will be in Seattle next year to watch the next International. When I was 17 I remember thinking to myself ""Wow! Dota is the best game I have ever played online how is it a WC3 custom map!?"" The idea was so awesome to me. I felt like I had my own little secret stash of gaming goodness just for me and my internet buddies to play. Well now the secrets out and the consequence couldn't be better. **Thank you, Valve for tackling such a juggernaught of a game and keeping true to its charm and seemingly endless strategical beauty.** You made the the 17 boy inside me leap for joy and the 24 year old me swim in nostalgic ecstasy.

**Please give reason for down voting so we may discuss your disagreement.**

Thank you for reading.

**TLDR;** Sorry but Dota isn't for the lazy.

**Note:** Wow the discussion this has spurred is awesome! I love the rebuttals and will respond to them soon work take precedence at the moment.

**Note:** I am continuing to edit and improve the guide. Remember this is a **FOUNDATION.** **I know very well how complex a game Dota is but everyone has to crawl before they walk and walk before they run.**

**EDIT** Updated ganking section a bit to make it more accommodating and less black and white. TP scrolls are discussed now in positioning, some grammar fixes.

**EDIT** Added explanations to the vision concepts. Some grammar fixes and I worded things a bit better so concepts were clearer. If someone would like to help me tighten up the grammar that would be great!

As many of you know, the last game between TongFu and Na'Vi at TI3 ended up being quite controversial, perhaps more so than any other game in Dota2 history. This has resulted in a lot of mixed opinions and due to the high stakes of the tournament, a lot of people are really passionate about their opinion. Because of this a large number of posts appeared on the subreddit that resulted in very low quality of discussion as well as many (100+) posts being made with pretty much the same content.

In hope of keeping the subreddit from piling up with the same post, here's a collection of many posts made regarding the situation. I'll provide the posts that resulted in at least 5 or so comments with the more popular threads being marked in bold letters.

I would also like to ask everyone to try to remain calm and have a reasonable discussion about the situation. Respect everyone else's opinion and be easy on the downvote button (take a read at what it says when you hover over it).

It may not seem like much, but pressing alt+enter after you choose ""Select Hero"" will decrease the load-time (theoretically) by ~10%!

Now if everyone were to do this, the heroes would all load in before the Hero selection timer hits 0:00 and the pregame timer starting at -1:30.

No one playing them could decode how to draft something that would throw them off their game.

The trick wasn't targeting Bulldog at all.  It was shutting down Akke/EGM.

By banning out Chen/Naga every game, it would naturally leave Wisp/Bat in the pool if Alliance didn't ban them out themselves, forcing Alliance to either forfeit both heroes (and get stomped as they did) or force them to pick one themselves.  If they waste both bans on Wisp/Bat then they give Navi an open field for their first two picks.

By doing this, Navi not only took away two of Alliance's marquee heroes, but they also forced them into picking specific heroes in order to prevent Navi from getting them.

The first two picks on Alliance we're forced to be Wisp and/or Bat if they were available, and if they didn't pick a Bulldog hero as one of those picks, the next two bans would have been specifically focused on LD/NP/BH to force the hero for Bulldog.

By drafting this way, Navi forced Allaince's draft to not include their core supports, possibly forcing Bat/Wisp picks and forcing a Bulldog hero pick early.

Alliance saw through this and made sure to get Bulldog his heroes, but at the cost of their supports.  Loda and S4 got who they wanted, but would have to draft their heroes late in the draft to make sure they locked up Wisp/Bat/Bulldog.

Akke/EGM obviously played great on other heroes, but you could easily see how badly this disrupted the normal game and opened the door for Navi to take 2 games off of them, almost 3...

In their first meeting in the upper bracket, Alliance handily served Navi two losses, and I don't think it had anything to do with new strats or improved play...they just didn't figure out how to draft against Alliance yet.

Kudos to Puppey for getting this sorted out and giving us an amazing grand final as a result...and obviously kudos to Alliance for pushing through despite being handicapped in the draft.",,False,,t5_2s580,False,,rubick,True,t3_1kcfkt,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1kcfkt/puppey_deserves_more_praise_for_his_drafting/,

I’m glad to announce that I’ve teamed up with an awesome team of people, to bring you an exciting new website: http://dotabuff.com !

It’s the logical follow-up to the current http://stats.dota2.be, and should feature everything you’re used to and more! All current stats.dota2.be links should redirect automatically to our new site!

Without further ado, behold the impressive improvement and feature list:

- Faster match updating! After your match is done, it should appear on the website within 15 min! Most of the time, this will be even under 5 minutes!
- Better alias support! Your current name will now always be shown, while still having the alias information available!
- So much data! Matchmaking games, bot games, you name it! We’re tracking 100% of public dota 2 matches.
- Player hero statistics, so you can easily find your best (and worst) hero of the bunch.
- More accurate stats thanks to removing almost all the invalid matches!
- Multi language support! (currently English, Portuguese, Chinese, Russian)
- Steam avatars!
- Real time hero stats!
- Item statistics! See which items are most successful on specific heroes!
- Search autocomplete!
- Launch and download match replays straight from the match webpage!
- Winrates with friends!
- Total and weekly time played on your player profile!
- Player records! Find your longest match, your highest gpm or even your highest killcount!
- And last but not least: No ads!

We worked very hard to bring you a very nice looking, very stable website, to handle the massive response you’ve been giving us.

This isn’t an endpoint for us though. We’ll continue to work on improving the website and adding more cool features! If you want to stay up to date, follow us on twitter: http://twitter.com/dotabuff

We hope you’re just as excited as we are about this new update!

We’ll be answering any questions you guys might have in this topic aswell, so AUsA!. The people replying and part of our awesome team are gfmidway, jcoene and lawliepop. You may recognize these names as the people behind the popular LoL website ELOBUFF and previously famous eSports website GotFrag.com.

Edit: Wow, amazing response guys! Our server is having a hard time handling all your massive requests at the moment, but it should improve soon! We're looking into it aswell.

Hey r/Dota2,

In about 2 weeks time, the world of Dota will descend on Seattle. Players, Casters and Fans alike will flood the halls of Benaroya for the world's biggest eSports tournament. Legendary moments will no doubt play out in real time, and we want to be there to capture them for the Dota 2 subreddit community at home.

In the same vein as [r/Games recent subreddit reporters for E3](http://www.youtube.com/user/RedditGames), we want to be your dedicated reporters for this year’s International.

*So who are we?* Our small team attended and covered The International with ESFI World last year, producing articles, photo galleries and video interviews during the event. This year however, we are back at Benaroya, on our own dime, and totally unaffiliated with any Dota 2 or eSports organization. Along with some friends at the event (you probably know some of them!), we're looking to kick some proverbial ass (in the form of content for the subreddit). 

For our interviews, we'll be asking your questions. A thread will go up on the subreddit the night before or the morning of, asking for your questions for a specific player or personality. As soon as we have enough, we'll sit them in front of our camera for an interview.

We're hoping to produce *at least* two community driven interviews each day, along with a gallery of the best pictures of the day. Past that, we're open to any suggestions. If you've got something you want to see out of TI3, let us know what you want to see in this thread, and we'll try our best to oblige.

Our coverage does have some limitations; last year, we were fortunate enough to have someone fluent in Chinese who acted as our translator, but unfortunately we are not as lucky this year. We still very much want to do interviews with the non-English speaking Chinese players, but that will take your help. If you’re going to be in Seattle during TI3, speak English and Chinese fluently, and want to keep us from slumming it on Google Translate, then [send us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=ReaverXai). 

This isn’t just a call for translators either - if you have any way you think you could be of assistance to producing some Reddit TI3 coverage and want to help out, just [shoot us a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=ReaverXai).

And please, if you're interested in following us and our interviews throughout the TI3 week, please check out and subscribe to the new Reddit Dota 2 [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/redditdota2), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/redditdota2) and [RedditDota2](http://twitter.com/redditdota2). Of course, we'll be sure to share the best stuff here as well.

This cant be allowed or the shop will be overrun with inconsistent, extremely low quality and ugly sets.

Valve, get your shit together and take this thing of the shop. This is **almost** bad as the Timebreaker situation.

We CAN'T ALLOW stuff like this happen. The workshop is already as chaotic and trash filled as it is, we can't allow people to ""cheat"" the system like this, because it also hurts who makes good quality items that dont get to see the spotlight.

If I was Anuxi, :3 and the other creators, I would be fucking pissed.

EDIT: You guys arent getting the point. This marks the begining of sub-par items entering the shop , that breaks the rules and its votes were ""manipulated"". This cant happen again.

We're stationed in Vaxholm, just off the Capital of Stockholm. There is easy access by bus, a ride of at most 45 minutes.

We'll be opening the cinema just after 21.00 on the 11th, and continue to the very end the next morning.

We will only be asking for you to join us as a member at WESF (Waxholms E-sports Förening) and a symbolic entrance fee of 50kr.

Popcorn and drinks will be sold at location.

If you would like to attend, or have any questions at all, please contact us at info@wesf.se or Twitter @ [WESF.SE](http://twitter.com/wesf_se)

We would love to see you there!

And it helps a lot to people who are playing alone, and don't really have many friends to stack with in matchmaking.

**Idea**: Im sure many of you had games where you got matchmaked with random people that 100% work as team, are friendly and you simply enjoyed game with them. Aswell, many people don't respond to friend requests because they don't see them or for any other reason.

Why not have an option to queue again with same players?

Friend adding can be annoying, because it's lame to add people all the time. I think i would add like 100 random people troughout 1 week of playing.

**So, why not add a button ''Play again?'' at the endgame screen, and every guy from your team that clicks it, gets queued with you for next game in matchmaking!**

Matchmaking would be a lot more enjoyable.

This is not good.  If you do this you are giving up 33% of the regen from your bottle.  The nerf, however, is only a 15% hit to bottle crow regen since the courier is only slowed on the way home.

There may be times when having the courier move at full speed makes it worth it to send back a 1 charge bottle, but for actual repeated bottle crowing it's better to continue to do it the standard way with an empty bottle.

EDIT:  For those that want more rigor -
Assume 2 trip refill (ie constant bottle crowing).  This is the BEST case for using 2 charges.

regen/sec for empty bottle = 3charges * crowspeed/2.42*d

regen/sec for 2 charge bottle = 2 charges * crowspeed/2*d

regen(empty)/ regen(2 charges) = 3/2.42 after cancelling.  


Conclusion - using all three charges is a 24% increase in your regen/sec over sending bottle back with 1 charge.

I know the math in the original post is a bit off but I knew the conclusion was the same and this post is directed at new players.

EDIT2:  I know it's not actually 15%, old bottle crow to new is a 2/2.42 change following the same method as above, which is a 17.3% nerf to regen/s for 24/7 bottle crowing.",Discussion,False,,t5_2s580,1370715738.0,discuss,zet,True,t3_1fvics,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1fvics/psa_on_bottle_crowing_in_678/,

P.S.: Please don't crash my server! :(

Edit: Since my server couldn't really handle the load I applied a quick change: You now need to search for the exact nickname to match, rather than any part of the nickname. This should clear up most of the load going on right now.

Back in Dota 1 if you notice the enemy would try to kill you inside your fountain you could just hide behind the trees in your base to become almost unreachable by the enemy and this often caused them to stop trying to fool around and end the game. In Dota 2 that is completely different because the fountain area is much smaller, making you an easy target against hooks or Batrider's dagger + ult combo for example, not to mention that people have extra reasons to keep killing you there for 5+ minutes to inflate their kill score, gpm and xpm. The only option as a hiding spot in Dota 2 is the area in the middle of the trees right outside the fountain, which is not protected by the fountain and enemies can easily reach you if they saw you hiding there.

[Here's a few pictures of Sentinel (Radiant) and Scourge (Dire) bases in Dota 1. The difference is huge.](http://imgur.com/a/5egJs)

Fountain camping has absolutely no strategic value in the game and it's done just so a few people can feast on the misery of half of the players on the match that must wait for long minutes before the game finally ends since they can't just quit like in Dota 1. I really think Valve should reformulate the layout of Dire's and Radiant's fountain area and add trees, specially to make the map consistent with Dota 1 which was one of the basic rules that were supposed to be followed by the dev team.",Suggestion,False,,t5_2s580,False,suggest,teamoj,True,t3_1f9alt,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1f9alt/we_need_trees_inside_the_fountain_area_just_like/,

The offlane is the least popular of the three lanes in dota, and one most often hears ""solo mid"" or ""bot"" called in matchmaking. Often people go there because it's the only lane left, and do not take any special precautions to ensure that they will have a good time there. It is the most dangerous lane, and decent opponents will exploit that to net themselves an easy first blood. But despair not, slahser is here to help you master the offlane.


First off, the offlane is the lane where the creeps are the furthest removed from your tower, and much closer to the enemy tower. Radiant offlane is top left of map, dire offlane bottom right. On the offlane you have a long walk back to the safety of the tower, while your enemy is much closer to his. It is therefore very hard to kill the enemy hero, and you are much more vulnerable. To make it even more difficult for the brave offlaner, your enemy has 3 potential neutral creep camps on the radiant offlane, which  he can draw to his lane, whereas you only have 1. On dire offlane he has 1 neutral camp, and you have none. He can thus deny you gold, exp, and positional advantage by manipulating the neutral creeps, with your options being much more limited.


But despair not. There are some tricks you can use to avoid dying on the offlane, and even making it much more likely that you can kill the enemy. The way to achieve this is quite simple: you want to make your offlane a safelane, and to do this you need to manipulate the creeps position, so that they meet as close to your tower as possible, and as far away from your enemies tower. This map shows you what you want to do: http://i.imgur.com/DIa3BDv.jpg 
The black lines are where the creeps naturally meet, the red lanes where you, the perceptive offlaner, wants it to meet, and the blue spots are the creep camps that can influence the creep position.


**Creep Block**
The first step towards achieving perfect creep positioning is also the hardest. This is to perform a creep block. The intention with the offlane creep block is to block all the melee creeps, and to make the ranged creep go ahead in front. If performed correctly, your ranged creep will be dead before the melee ones start fighting. Since the ranged creep is the most fragile of the creeps, but deal most damage, the premature death of this creep will make the enemies creeps deal more damage, thus pushing his wave away from the safety of his tower. Here is a video showing me blocking with bounty hunter: http://youtu.be/LiojAfxWFas 

I see this block so rarely (if ever) in public matchmaking, that the motivation to spread this crucial block is my main reason for creating this offlane guide.

This block takes practice, and you are going to mess it up a lot. I still do sometimes. But blocking correctly will net you a significant advantage in terms of lane position. If you perform the block correct, lesser enlightened players may think you just suck at blocking, and let the ranged creep past on accident, thus prompting ""lol nice block noob"". If this happens, just shrug with a smug grin on your face. If, however, you have a lane partner that thinks it imperative to ""fix"" your ""failed"" block by blocking the ranged creep, you have my permission to ping him twice and say ""Good sir, it is imperative that thou dost not block the ranged creep."" Further elaboration and enlightenment to the prole on the subject I leave to you. After you have performed your block, it is also of utmost importance to damage your own creeps as soon as they hit under half health, since this will help push the wave towards your tower. You may consider prioritizing this above getting last hits the first few waves.


**Ward Spot**
So you made a perfect creep block, and the creeps are pushing towards your tower. But you did not ward the enemy's neutral camps, and they just pulled their creepwave to a double stack, thus denying you an entire wave of exp and gold and pushing the creeps back to their tower. The solution is obvious: buy 1 set of observers in the beginning and ward the enemy neutral camps. Here is the 1 ward spot on sentinel offlane: http://i.imgur.com/7L1XkUe.jpg
And the 2 ward spot I recommend: http://imgur.com/IyEpr0h

This will block both camps. You don't really need to block the small camp close to the tier 2 top tower on dire, since the pull is rare and difficult to make. On dire offlane you just need to place 1 ward for their pull camp, and you are good to go.


**Misc**
What is essential however is that you spawn as soon as possible, click to where you want to place your wards, and buy your items before you leave the shop. It needs to be fast, since you want to place the wards and be back in the lane to block your ranged creep. You want it to look like this:  http://youtu.be/S20Ggfub8LY
And it could even be done faster than that.
For items I recommend, on melee heroes, stout shield, 1 tango, a salve, and of course 1 set observer wards. For ranged heroes, drop the stout shield and get some branches or a ring of protection instead.

They may counter your block with sentries, but in that case you may type ""damn tryhards"" and try to adapt as best as possible, perhaps blocking the spawn every minute with your own hero. This can be risky however, depending on the enemy heroes.

Good solo offlane heroes include bounty hunter, wind runner, timbersaw, clockwerk, clinkz, syllabear and dark seer. Make sure to place wards at the creep camps and block the melee creeps with all of them. Now go out there and show me how to dominate as offlane solo. 

And one last thing: Don't forget to tell your teammates, as soon as everybody's hero pick screen pops up, that ""I can solo offlane"", so they can pick heroes for jungle and the other lanes. Good luck.

A match to see offlane in practice: http://dotabuff.com/matches/201058087

Here i use cogs to help me block. Consider this my guide to clockwerk as well. For a more realistic, and less perfect, clock game, look around in my match history.

Your hero will move slightly closer before beginning the orb attack, because orb attacks are spells and every spell is currently under-ranged.

First, the time ended up being completely wrong, leaving us to mindlessly press F5 over and over for about 45 minutes, even though the tickets were never posted during that time, despite no response from Valve.

Then, the tickets are finally up. But we're all forced to remember that we have to use the slow, bug-ridden Dota Store to try to get tickets. Then begins an hour-long process of the ticket quantities fluctuating because Valve never explained that they're putting them up in batches. We all add them to our cart, and they're not in our cart. We try checking out, but of course there's always an error. The worst part is that it keeps looking like you're about to get a ticket, and then the store breaks again. The whole process is a mess. We walk away with nothing after 2 hours of dealing with one of the most infuriating user experiences I've ever seen.

Then, the most maddening part of all, the tickets are marketable. They immediately jump to over $200 on the Steam Community Market.

Any half-decent ticket site would just tell you the tickets are sold out after 10 minutes or whatever. Instead, Valve basically put us all through a stressful, frustrating 1 hour, 45 minute process with the hope of glitching a ticket past checkout. There was never a reliable way to figure out if the tickets were actually sold out, so we just had to keep trying to buy one, and failing to do so. It basically made it feel like they really didn't care about the user experience, or making the process fair. I could have jumped into the process an hour after the announced time and still had about the same chance of getting a ticket.

In case you couldn't tell, I didn't get a ticket. I'm guessing a lot of other people didn't get them, even though we all went through the same terrible process and we all just wanted to go to the tournament, not turn the tickets around on *Valve's own market* for a $200 profit. It was a complete waste of my time, and I'm honestly shocked that something linked to so huge of an event was planned so terribly. If you did get one, and you actually *want* to go, then I'm happy for you.

But, it wasn't the lack of a ticket that made me angry. Obviously, people have to be left out when there's a venue with limited space. It was the process itself which was maddening. I wasted 2 hours of my time, when this whole thing should have been done within 20 minutes at most. Additionally, there was no indication by Valve as to what was happening (and that the tickets were being sold in batches), so it kept getting everyone's hopes up and then breaking them. 

This whole thing was ridiculous and I felt like I was just a guinea pig in an experiment to test how much traffic the Dota Store could take, and how many times you can make someone keep trying after getting their hopes up and bringing them back down. Valve needs to get their act together with the Store and their ability to actually talk to the community. Get a Community Manager or something. Every other notable game company has one. Seriously, the need for one has never been more apparent than it was today.

I am an employee and administrator of reddit.com. There has been a recent flurry of incidents surrounding the e-sports related subreddits that need to be addressed.

The problem I'm referring to is 'vote cheating'. Vote cheating simply means that something is inorganically being done to manipulate votes on a post or comment. There aren't many site-wide rules on reddit, but one of them is [""do not engage in vote cheating or manipulation""](http://www.reddit.com/rules). Here are some examples of what vote cheating tends to look like:

* Emailing a submission to a group of friends, coworkers, or forest trolls and asking them to vote.
* Engaging in voting 'cliques', where a group of accounts consistently and repeatedly votes on specific content.
* Asking for upvotes on reddit, teamliquid, twitter, facebook, skype, etc.
* Using services or bots to automate mass voting.
* Asking people watching your stream to go upvote/downvote someone or something.

The reason this rule exists is we want to ensure, to the best of our ability, that there is a level playing field for all submissions on reddit. No submission should have more or less of a chance of being seen due to manipulation. It isn't a perfect system, but we do what we can to keep it as fair as possible.

----

Vote manipulation is a very broad spectrum of behaviour. We're not trying to be assholes here, we're trying to stop cheating and keep things fair. If you post a link on reddit and some friends see it and vote on it, we don't care. If more consistent patterns show up, we're going to be more concerned. You all aren't stupid; if you're doing something that feels like manipulation, it probably is.

We have put a lot of work into the site to mitigate vote cheating wherever possible, both via automated and manual means. If we catch an account or set of accounts vote cheating on reddit, then there is a good chance we'll take some sort of action against those accounts (such as banning).

----

The reason I'm directly bringing this up on the big e-sports related subreddits is that the problem of vote cheating has started to become very commonplace here. It is damn near 'expected behaviour' in some folks eyes, so recent banning incidents have been met with arguments such as 'everyone does it!' - this is not an acceptable excuse.

So, to make things crystal clear: If you engage or collude in the manipulation of votes of your own or others submissions on reddit, do not be surprised when we ban you. If you are engaging in this behaviour today and think you are getting away with it, consider this your fair warning to stop immediately.

Also, if the vote manipulation is being performed by the employees of a specific site, and we are unable to stop it via normal means, we may ban the site from being submitted to reddit until the issue can be addressed. This is a fairly extreme course of action that we rarely have to invoke, but it is a measure that has become more commonplace for sites common on e-sports related subreddits.

The action of barring a site from being submitted to reddit can only be performed by employees of reddit, and not the moderators. The mods are a completely volunteer group with no view into the vote cheating mitigation system. If your site gets banned, complaining to or about the moderators will get you nowhere.

----

Thanks for reading. I'll be happy to answer what questions I can in the comments. I'm a pretty close follower of various e-sports things, so don't feel the need to do any laborious exposition.

I very often end up in situations where I read random comments on reddit, on IRC, over on teamliquid or inside the game client, and I'm simply amazed by the assumptions people make. So I decided to help. This guide will tackle in a very simple way a few issues commonly raised.

**1. Matchmaking Basics**

A lot of people seem very confused about matchmaking rating. The knowledge I have is based on information available from dev.dota2.com, various community figures (purge has a vlog on matchmaking), and a few other nuggets of infortmation.

Matchmaking rating has nothing to do with how well you perform in the game. It also has nothing to do with your performance bars for each hero. You win, you gain rating, you lose, you lose rating. It's as simple as that.

However not every result affects you in the same way, so even if you have higher win ratio, that doesn't directly translate into higher mmr. The key here is winning all the games you should win, and then some. Losing a game where you had the mmr advantage hurts more than losing a game where you shouldn't. The system does NOT force a 50% win ratio, that's simply the result of it trying to make fair games.

**But Palmar, I'm stuck in MMR hell**

No, you're not. In fact, a Valve developer admitted to Purge having tried that out on people who claimed to be in the wrong MMR bracket to manually push them higher. Well... yeah, that didn't go well.

In fact, over enough games you will reach the mmr you should be at. There are obviously way to skew this a bit, for example if you're just really fucking good with one hero and play only that, the system won't care and will adjust your rating as if you played all heroes at that level.

Additionally if you always queue with a buddy, you have an advantage, so when you go solo for giggles, you might run into problems. However, the system does take into account the advantage of queueing as a party.

But yes, the system will always adjust, and rate you where you should be based on your average game.

**But how can I be in the same bracket as these noobs??**

You are, that's the sad story here. Even more sadly, the variance is relatively small for everyone who is not at the extremes (high or low) in skill level. For anyone below the very high bracket, you're mostly going to be queue-ing with people who are very close to you in mmr. This is a result of most people being close in mmr due to how the system will create a bell curve around the center of the rating.

So next time you want to flame some noob support who is ""taking your farm"" or a carry that ""can't last hit"", remember that you're queue-ing with these people for a reason.

The caveat here is that parties with a large skill range fuck the system over and valve has not got any brilliant solution to that at the moment. But rest assured, if there actually is a complete newbie in your game, there's also a high level buddy with him. If there isn't, the guy probably isn't a complete newbie and you're just wrong.

**Statistical bias, why you need to stop whining about pubs**

Just some quick napkin math. Let's assume that we win 50% of our games. That's close to correct for most of us non-pro mortals. Usually when you're winning, you're not raging that hard about your team.

Let's also remember, that the statistical chance of you being the worst player on your team is only 20%. So this means, in combination with the 50% winrate, that you LOSE 40% of your games and someone is worse than you!

I hope you see where I'm going with this. Because of the nature of the game, you can legitimately make an argument that you lose 40% of your games because you're matched with noobs. And only 10% of the games you lose because you sucked a bit yourself... so yeah, everyone has a bad game occasionally, if you play 9/10 games well it's fine? right?

This is obviously very dumb. And it creates this huge bias that makes even fairly sane people start ranting about the ""noobs"" on their team.

Well, these are the noobs you deserve. I sometimes wonder, if all the dota 2 players cry about ""terrible pubs"", who are these terrible pubs? The truth is, they are us.

**Why you should play to win**

Here's the kicker. You can only control one variable, that is your own performance. You cannot win them all, and assuming over multiple games everything will normalise, you will probably be somewhere close to 50%. If you want to improve you need to make sure you take every win you can take, and then you need to snatch out a few games you were going to lose.

If you play as well as you possibly can, you give your team the highest chance of winning. Almost half the time it's not going to be enough, but if you can be the difference between winning 50% of the time and winning 53% of the time, do your best!

Focus on yourself, ignore the losses. There is equal chance the other team has bad players and you have bad players. If you just focus on playing the best you can, you will end up improving, and your mmr will go up.

**How valve deals with strange parties**

Just know this, if you're queue-ing in a party with big skill difference, the system has no clue what to do with you. You'd expect it to use average mmr, but valve has explained that instead they skew it higher towards the highest rated player, because they discovered that was more balanced. However this obviously puts a lot of pressure on the highest skilled player to play a hero that can take advantage of his skill level for the party to succeed.

I don't think there is a good solution to this at the moment.

**Other things, why people suck at supporting**

I'll leave this up to you, pick your poison. I very often see people complaining about how people don't know how to support. So I'll simply list the possible explanations, and you guys can pick the one you like.

Knowing what we do about the mmr system, we know that on average the player playing the ""bad support"" is equal to you in skill level. So here's why he's doing random stupid shit. (not warding, ruining farm, not ganking, feeding, stealing kills whatever your fancy is)

1. Support is much harder to play than other roles, thus more prone to failing.
2. Support is equally hard to play, but everyone has more skill at other roles.
3. Despite you thinking otherwise, the support is simply playing to his best ability, which matches your ability in your current role.

I'm inclined to go with option number 3.

**How this makes your life better**

The first step is admittance. You are playing with people who are equally good as you. They may be having a good or a bad game, and because your sample size with the pubs you end up with is very, very small (usually 1 game), you cannot judge them. Admit you're not better than your team.

If someone is having a bad game, help them. Gank their lane, buy them wards, tp to save them, grant them freefarm. Remember that this guy is potentially a player of similar skill to yourself. It's never worth abandoning your team because ""they suck"". Chances are it's just that guy having a terrible game, so you can help pull him back by preventing him from digging an even deeper hole.

Accept that you can't win them all. Don't be mad about it, remember that you're dealing with equals, peers. Someone has a bad game and feeds? You cannot fault them, you can only fault yourself for being in a bracket where people do that in the fashion this guy just did. Take the wins you can, lose the others with grace. Always go down fighting.

At every point in the game, analyze the situation and try to figure out how you can go from your current position, to a victory. Then try to execute based on that. Sometimes there is no route to victory, in fact, most of the time when solo queue-ing you cannot do much.

Thanks to pikaxiu,Lenkz,1000,298,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1f2pl4/g1league_appreciation_thread_thanks_to_pikaxiu/,"Okay guys, there has been a lot of negative energy about this tournament. Right after the showmatch people had their pitchforks out and was spreading the hate. G1-League could have been better, it could.

But it doesn't take away that pikaxiu put together a tournament, flew 3 international teams to China, had a good prize pool and some of that came out of his own pocket! (17173.com seems to have paid some aswell)
If anything we should tell pikaxiu that holding a tournament like this is worth it, and encourage him to go out find sponsors and do it all again.

Lets all give pikaxiu some love, for this tournament that he has held. Tournaments like this is awesome, and even though the showmatch kind of sucked, the rest of the tournament has been awesome and entertaining to watch.

If 2p, pikaxiu or 17173.com reads this, just know that we in the western scene/community loves you for inviting teams from the western scene to G1-League, and please do this again. We were pretty upset that the All-star match didn't go the way we had hoped. You have to understand that a match like this is really important for us. But this is something that you can take with you, learn from this experience and make an even better event next time!

Thanks to pikaxiu or anybody from 2p and 17173.com.

[I was afraid that this would happen.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1abrti/hey_rdota2_im_an_american_in_s_korea_and_even/)

I was told by some redditors that I got everyone worked up over nothing, that I was going to end up being wrong, that I was wasting everyone's time.  I was called all sorts of names.

Today in Korea (the 11th) is the day that Nexon said that they would release the information about the new Korean server.  And they did.  Not only did they release information, they released the game in a closed Beta  [Here's the link to that information (though it's in Korean)](http://dota2.nexon.com/news/gmnews/view.aspx?n4ArticleSN=1#Scrol_01).  The people who showed up to the NSL qualifiers in Sindorim got beta keys from the Nexon people.

What is relevant to the non-Korean citizens of reddit (which is like more than 98% of reddit iirc from past admin blog posts) is that **unlike with League of Legends**,  the Korean server will not be playable by those people who do not link their Steam IDs with their Nexon IDs... also known as more than 99% of the world.  

*The issue that I'm writing this post to call attention to (and hopefully change) is that more than 99% of everyone reading this (myself included) cannot make a Nexon ID because more than 99% of you are not Korean citizens.*

In the past post that I made on this topic, which I linked at the beginning of this post, I explained that in Korea some companies don't allow foreigners (even those who have Registration Numbers, which is sometimes referred to as the Korean SSN) to play their games.  Nexon is one of them and they just so happen to be the biggest game company in Korea.

[Here is the proof that foreigners cannot make a Nexon ID and therefore cannot play in any Nexon games](http://imgur.com/Cml05JH,ckx7LI4,I8LBQ0b#0)  The problem arises when you try to authenticate your account.  Not only do you have to have a Registration Number with the government (again, which is sometimes referred to as a Korean SSN).  It just tells you that foreigners are not allowed to use any of Nexon's services (i.e. games).

In the past, [we all know that the Nexon guy Kim Injun or whatever said that foreigners can come to Korea and play in the NSL](http://www.joindota.com/en/news/10073-nexon-dota-2-manager-on-future-of-korea).  From the day that the NSL was announced I tried to register for it but ran into the same problem that I just linked above:  foreigners cannot use any of Nexon's services.  In order to register for the tournament, you needed a Nexon account that was authenticated.  Again, the authentication is where the problem arises.  I posted about this on Reddit and was promptly downvoted and insulted for daring to contradict this guy who *clearly* said the opposite of what I was saying (so clearly I must be wrong!).

If you're not authenticated (which they won't let anyone who isn't a Korean citizen do), you cannot proceed.

I have sent e-mails to Gaben from the day that it was announced that Nexon would be handling the Korean Dota2 servers, I have made tickets with Valve Support, and I have posted about it on the Official Dev Forums' Korean section.  All of my attempts to call attention this were either ignored (or at least not responded to) or deleted (which is what happened to my Dev forum post in the Korean section, even though I posted it in Korean).  It was after all of those things that [I made this post on this subreddit about the topic.](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1aa88y/when_connecting_to_aus_servers_my_korean_internet/)

---

Which brings us to today:

[Nexon updated their Dota 2 site](http://dota2.nexon.com/news/gmnews/view.aspx?n4ArticleSN=1#Scrol_01) with information about how their new Dota 2 client will work.

This particular section is the most important for those of us who are not Korean citizens:

&gt; 넥슨 회원 연동을 해야만 대한민국 서버에 접속할 수 있을까?

&gt;A : OK. 그 말이 정답이야. 도타 아이디에 넥슨 아이디 연동을 진행하고, 도타2 한국 런처를 통해 게임을 실행해야 대한민국 서버에서 게임을 진행할 수 있지. 넥슨 아이디와 도타 아이디 연동을 진행하더라도 스팀을 통해서 도타 2 를 실행하는 경우에는 대한민국 서버 이용이 불가능하다는 점을 꼭 기억해 줘.

&gt;회원 연동 후 도타 2 를 실행하면, 아래와 같이 매치 메이킹 지역 선택 화면에서 대한민국을 선택할 수 있어.

What this says, and I'm paraphrasing of course, is that in order to play on the Korean DotA2 servers, you must link your Steam ID with your Nexon ID and then ~~both install a new DotA2 client all over again and login to DotA2 through the Nexon client~~ (if you put -nexon in the launch options it will load the korean version actually, but the issue remains the same about the nexon id).  Again, only Korean citizens can have a Nexon ID.

So, to summarize: 

* Only Korean citizens can make a Nexon ID

* The Korean servers are only accessible through the separate Nexon Dota2 client ~~(that means you have to make a completely new install of Dota2 through Nexon's client)~~ (put -nexon in launch options to turn on 'korean mode', but you still need nexon id to be able to even get past the login prompt once the game starts)

* You can only access the Nexon Dota2 client by linking your Nexon ID to your Steam ID

* Only Korean citizens can make a Nexon ID

* Koreans can play with you, but you can't play with them

---

Now, some of you will say ""oh well w/e who cares just play on the regular servers and let them have their thing.""  [The problem with that is this](http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1aa88y/when_connecting_to_aus_servers_my_korean_internet/), which I posted a long time ago.  Korean internet is extremely fast... but only if you're connecting to an address that is physically located in Korea.  The moment you connect to something outside of Korea, your ping goes way up.  For those of us who live in Korea but are not Korean citizens (even the ones who have foreigner Registration Numbers), we don't have the luxury of being able to play with a less than 180ms ping unless we get lucky with the Great Firewall of China's Beijing servers (usually it's more than 400ms even though Seoul is a one hour flight from Beijing because of that Great Firewall).

Others will likely say something like ""well we can't do anything about it, it's nexon: a huge company.""  If Reddit can destroy a family and force a man to commit suicide, like what happened at Boston Marathon, and if Reddit can help force Microsoft to do a 180 on their XBox... It's unlikely that Reddit can't do anything about this matter.

Many others of you will explain Nexon's actions by saying that there's a law that prevents younger people (lower than 14 or 16 years old iirc) from playing games after 9pm.  This is true.  There is a law like that.  The reason why it doesn't explain Nexon's actions and is therefore ultimately wrong, though, is because this ""no-foreigners"" policy that they have has existed LONG before that law was passed (which was in 2011).  Furthermore, not every company has this policy.  So it's not a governmental law that makes them prevent foreigners from playing.  Riot Korea and Pmang, for example, allow foreigners to play if they have the Registration Number.  Nexon just doesn't let foreigners *at all* participate.  Therefore it cannot be because of government policy or else all the companies that *do* let foreigners play (like Pmang and Riot-Korea) would be in big legal trouble.",Other,False,,t5_2s580,1373547411.0,other,chen,True,t3_1i2b0e,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1i2b0e/only_korean_citizens_can_play_on_the_korean_server/,

But the thing is we spent money on something I consider an unfinished product.  As a finished product it's a terrific value.  ABSOLUTELY worth $10.  Courier, battle bonus, HUD, and other stetch goals we eventually unlock.  The compendium itself is probably the most interesting companion to any sport(not just e-sports) I've ever used.  But as of now the compendium is flat out raw in terms of development.  It almost seems like it's maybe not even 25% complete.  


I assumed that when I bought this that it would be my direct go to source to **everything International 2013**.  I should be able to click the book, see all the matchups, times, dates, everything.  When Team A beats Team B and advances I want to see the entire bracket NCAA style.  Obviously searching online for this information isn't a problem since we have an amazing community that provides these details for us but the Compendium should be able to do this as well. 


Also the qualifier predictions.....*Why aren't they updated real time?*  It would be amazing if I could click a tab such as ""most picked hero.""  A list opens up showing who is currently the most picked hero and which team picks certain heroes the most.  


Or if I wanted to track who has the highest GPM thus far it will show the name of the player and his current GPM.  


Anyways maybe I'm being overly critical but I just feel like the compendium has so much potential and it's just really mediocre right now.

After completing my last game of Dota (5-1 silencer not bad, 20 min win!) I apparently won a Asian man. I was looking forward to some sort of hat or something but apparently Valve is now awarding players with Slavery, which is alright I guess. I just need some advice on how to care for the asain man before he arrives in the mail because I have never gotten something like this before. I am very worried because I once had to care for a hampster and it died to my negligence. 

To begin, how much work will the Asian man do around the house? It says that he is support so I know that he will be used to cleaning up messes and running around, but when do I know what amount of work is too much for his frail body? I dont want to overwork the man, but if I have been awarded him I want to use him to his full potential, and the help with the ever increasing laundry piles would be great. 

Secondly, how often do I need to feed him? I'm not sure what this Chinese man eats, but I hardly have enough money to sustain myself, let alone buy lavish amounts of rice. 

Any advice would be appreciated. While it did not specify when the man would be arriving I want to be prepared. 

*edit: I just played another game and got another Asian man, so I'll just work the first one without food till he starves to save money. Thanks! ",Comedy,False,,t5_2s580,False,comedy,,True,t3_1hbnt1,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1hbnt1/just_won_a_asian_man_playing_dota_need_advice_on/,

https://twitter.com/LiquidKorok/status/365358273995620352

Tweets such as these shows why Valve is such a beloved company. You can see it from the attention to detail from how they host The International to the game itself that Valve is as passionate as we are when it comes to how much love is poured into making DotA 2. I even hesitate to use the word ""fans"" as Gabe has said in the intro that they're as much of fans of DotA as we are. 

Valve's job isn't easy and in many ways I feel that their work on DotA 2 as a game in terms of it's actual development is very different from their projects such as Half Life, Counter Strike, Left 4 Dead and Portal. As someone who's bought every title that has Valve's label on it thus far, Valve has never been as transparent as a company before as they are now with Dota 2. You see the developers themselves directly respond towards the community at the dev.dota2.com website giving their stance on topics such as why they don't wish to reveal a player's ELO/MMR as well as why there isn't a concede option (whether you agree or disagree). They're also quick at taking suggestions from reddit such as spectator's being able to see a ward's range and integrating in the game's next patch cycle which goes to show that Valve is being keen on reddit posts as well. 

Finally we're already seeing a ton of memorable events thus far in this years International from a several awesome games to the hilarious laugh out loud all-stars match to end the first day with a bang and i'm sure there's more to come. The production level aside though, there's just SO MUCH attention to detail that reveals just how smart Valve is as a company in taking the intuitive to further push e-sports as a whole. Having pro players being able to actually sign their autograph to fans digitally and handing out actual swag being sent to pubstomps from around the world are just few examples of Valve's ingenuity.

So I wanted to thank the hard working people at Valve for being the helm of DotA 2. We as the players might not always agree with Valve's decision as a company but I feel we have the same vision of making DotA 2 the best possible game out there with no signs of stopping until it does. I don't think any other game development company could have done an outstanding of a job as the guys as Valve has and we simply wouldn't have it any other way.

This is really upsetting because we're unable to play with many of our friends due to this issue. It is also worrying for the future of competitive Dota2 in Australia. 

Personally i hit 200ms on USWEST servers (which i play on) and 350-400ms on SEA servers. Other Australians have it flipped where they have 400ms on USWEST and 100-150ms on SEA.

As it has been stated in the following thread, Australians are laid back and not likely to kick up a stink over such an issue but it really does need to be addressed and the only way we will see this is if we continue to post and support each other.

Please post in the above thread to show your support, even if you're not Australian we would appreciate your help in getting our own servers.

**VOD PAGE**: www.dotacinema.com/vods

Hey guys, after months of work, we've officially launched our spoiler-free VOD section! The one thing we have been trying to remedy is the overwhelming feeling that new users get. As a result there is an interactive tutorial that will show upon your first visit. In addition we have a video tutorial and a full text tutorial. Links can be found below.

**Bug Reports**: http://www.dotacinema.com/forum/index.php?/topic/8053-bug-reports-vod-section-only/

**Feature Requests**: http://www.dotacinema.com/forum/index.php?/topic/8054-feature-request/

**Full Text Tutorial**: http://www.dotacinema.com/forum/index.php?/topic/8013-vod-section-in-depth-tutorial-text/

Please let us know what you think! Keep in mind that we had to put a lot of features on the backburner in order to keep this launch date. I feel like one of the most popular feature  requests would be the ability to filter by Heroes. We are going to make this our top priority, although I don't know how long it will actually take.  Let me know if you have any questions/concerns and I'll do my best to reply.

Special thanks to our two main programming beasts, Pietro and bukka!

While I am not allowed to speak about the details of the new game, I just want to say that no one is able to come close to the amount of detail, or the hidden easter eggs, or awesome voice work that DOTA 2 brings to the table.

I always find people complaining about this or that in DOTA 2, but honestly, when comparing it to what other companies have been able to come up with in this same genre it really shines.  

One seemingly small thing I have especially noticed is the way that the skills for each hero really stand out, both audibly and visibly, in a way that make each of the heroes skills seem very unique.  This is important so that in a split second you can tell who is doing what and when, and it also just makes the game more entertaining as it feels like a very different experience depending on the hero you play.  Something as small as Kunkka's sword shining before a Tidebringer, or the noise Puck makes when he phase shifts.  The other games just really don't bring this quality to the playing field. The voice work of each hero, the small things they say to each other, all these things just give Dota 2 entertainment value that is hard to find elsewhere.  

Let's try to make a nice list of things like this so when new people (or even the veterans among us) come to this subreddit,  they can read them and notice the extra work the valve employees put in to this game.

TL;DR   The amount of attention to small details that Valve has, adds up to huge differences in the quality between Dota2 and it's competitors.

Recently I polled some people for a psychology-based video on Dota 2 tricks. Well, the answers were literally 50/50 or 33/33/33 for each question, so the questions I surveyed for gave no concrete results I could use.

Still, I wanted to make this type of series, which looks at what Dota players think and how to take advantage of their thoughts. This is mostly for newer players, as a lot of this stuff is fairly obvious, but hopefully someone can learn something, or try out one of these small tricks.

Dota 2 only needs 2 CPU cores, this 3.0 GHz Pentium will be more than enough. 4 GB of RAM is plenty and graphics card has $30 MIR and $10 off from promo code, making it a steal. The case is on a pretty cool sale too, and 250GB HDD should be enough for the average customer and can be easily upgraded.

There you go, and I hope I helped someone save their money :D

EDIT: Apparently some reviews classify the previous PSU I posted as a ticking time bomb. Found a even better unit. $20 MIR and $15 promo code? Yes, please! It is also modular so the cable management is a piece of cake.

EDIT2: This is getting a lot more response than i expected. I listened to your advice and got rid of the DVD writer.

As for the people saying that this is not upgradable - it doesn't matter. This is for people who dont know much about computers and just want to play Dota 2.

(Also you can get a used i5 2400 and something like 7870XT and play any game you want on 1080p, to me that is upgradable.)

&gt; Hey guys, PC Gamer editor here. Our tagging system on PCG, first and foremost, is how our database pulls stories into the hub pages we have on the website: http://www.pcgamer.com/game/dota-2

&gt; The stories in question were written by a new contributor; I'm sorry if it was offensive to see a headline for a competing game in the same genre in the Dota 2 news feed. Sometimes we might start off writing a story with a broader scope--comparing LoL's policies to Dota 2's, for instance--and end up editing out that line or paragraph, but not changing the original tags. We've been writing about Dota 2 (and other games in the genre) a bunch over the past few years without complaints about this, so hopefully you can take that as a sign that we're not some gang of scheming, Texan Illuminati pageview barons.

&gt; Bottom line: it's not part of our strategy to put non-relevant content in front of y'all. I've removed the tag from these stories; I'm unsure if the Steam news feed dynamically updates, but if not I'm sure it won't be long until it gets pushed down by other Dota 2 posts.

&gt; Feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk more about this. We like cats and chocolate milk and maybe we can be friends.

Lets hangout more?,Axeltoss,1096,462,605,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1iab2q/hi_from_rstarcraft_lets_hangout_more/,"So I made a thread on r/leagueoflegends a couple days ago (http://redd.it/1i50e1) with the intentions of encouraging more interaction between our communities because the animosity that currently exists is pretty silly. I love all games! I'm also certain I'm not alone.

I feel a main idea behind this is the sheer intimidation effect of learning a new game. A lot of people see SC2 and feel it is way to complicated and daunting to try to jump into. For me personally that's why I haven't really been able to get into dota2! But I want to give the game the respect it deserves, an I think we can fix that!


I propose a ""coaching exchange"" idea where each person would both give and receive coaching in their respective games. I offered free coaching from myself to r/leagueoflegends in exchange for being able to jump into their game to play with them. The response I received was staggering.

I can't possibly coach them all so thankfully some of my friends from r/starcraft offered similar deals.

I wish to do this with dota 2 as well.

So here I am. If you guys are open to it, perhaps this thread can serve as an exchange point. Where Starcraft 2 players and Dota 2 players can link up and exchange coaching.

To start things off, I offer 4 hours of free coaching in my game (SC2) to 4 of you, for 4 hours of gameplay with the 4 of you in your game. 

Can someone teach me the ropes? :D

I assure you that it's one of the most ridiculous reviews I read in a while. I will post just best quotes here (as it was written in Polish), but in case of enough number of people interested, I may prepare full English translation.

* ""Time of League of Legends clones continues""

* ""Basic difference between this two titles is that League of Legends started from zero - Riot was poor, yet ambitious studio, willing to gain appreciation and fame. Dota was developed by Valve specialists - same people who created Half-Life and Steam.

* ""You are able to control allied heroes - but only when player leaves the game""

* (about denying) ""(...) heroes can kill allied soldiers - for example, when they see that enemy will earn gold for killing them""

* ""Freshmen will be discouraged by the fact, that when hero kills his enemy, he takes some of his money - what can be really frustrating""

* ""All in all game may look to hard for a lot of players""

* ""All heroes are playable from the beginning (...). It simplifies ability to use all in-game mechanics, but takes joy of buying your long awaited hero""

* ""Another deficiency is fact, that some heroes are over-powered - best examples are Sniper, Windrunner, Earthshaker and Zeus. On the other hand, Meepo and Shadow Fiend in most cases appear to be totally useless.""

* ""Difference between success and defeat depends on picking most powerful heroes - which blocks them for enemy same time.""

* ""The game offers only one map, in addition, not very interesting.""

List and fragment about OP heroes made me laugh so much :)

As a very new player that is too anxious to actually play the game I've decided to calculate a few answers to some questions I had.
Most of those are very basic and probably well known, but maybe there are a few new facts for you in it, so why not post it here.


**Average jungle gold** (no skeletons)

small camp - 81.33

medium camp - 102.6

large camp - 124

ancients - 264.33

total jungle - 81.33 + 2×102.6 + 2×124 = 534.53 gold per minute

On average there are 14.13 creeps in a jungle, so the bonusgold for an Alchemist doing the whole jungle is (without ancients):

30×14.13 = 423.9, making his jungle 79% more effective.



**DPS increase due to lower BAT (Base Attack Time)**: 170/BAT-1

For example AM's dps is increased by 17%, Alchemist level 16 by 70%

This makes both crits and minus armor ~~more effective~~ work well on heroes with low BAT, by increasing already high DPS by a percentage, since they stack multiplicatively (e.g. Alchemist's DPS with a Daedalus has a multiplier of 1.425×1.7 = 2.4225, so a 142% increase in his raw DPS ~ damage × (attackspeed+100) )

Note that a lower BAT does in fact not make getting attack speed more effective than damage.



**Comparison of armor with HP in terms of Effective HP (EHP)**

worth of 1 HP in armor = armor+16.7 / HP

worth of 1 armor in HP = HP / armor+16.7

It scales linearly, meaning that in order to get the worth of 200 HP just multiply the worth of one HP with 200. Note that this only works with positive armor, with negative armor the formula is not as easy to memorize, so I didn't bother to write it down.


So for example AC (Assault Cuirass) gives the same amount of (physical) EHP as heart when

15 = 1060 × a+16.7 / h, producing the following graph:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=17702%2F15%2B%28212+a%29%2F3+for+a+%3D+-5+to+20

At the line both are the same, above it AC is better, below it Heart.


Skaadi gives the same amount of EHP as a heart when

(h+675)×(1+0.06×(a+25/7)) = (h+1060)×(1+0.06×a), which results in this graph:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+-16825%2F1617%2B%285+h%29%2F539+for+h%3D500+to+3000

Skaadi is better for physical EHP below the line, Heart is better above the line, so when the enemy has a lot of minus armor (or if you're Doom), Skaadi might actually be better for tanking up than a Heart. (I must admit I was a little surprised by that, since no one ever buys Skaadi, despite it giving a bit more DPS than a heart on most strength heroes and a lot more on agi heroes.)


For Satanic it looks as follows (ignoring the EHP gain due to lifesteal): (h+475)×(1+0.06×(a+5)) = (h+1060)×(1+0.06×a)

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+-1475%2F117%2Bh%2F117+for+h%3D+500+to+3000

I'd say this makes Satanic better than Heart in almost all cases, because you'll obviously lifesteal more than 600 health (which would make the survivability of Satanic strictly better than the survivability of Heart)
as a carry when you have any chance of winning teamfights at all, unless you want an early Vitbooster or the 15 Strength and extra health are worth that much to you (arguably the case for CK and other Illusion heroes).
But maybe I'm missing something, so is there any good reason people get Hearts before Satanic on heroes like Tiny, DK, Alchemist, Slardar, SK, Lifestealer, Doom or Lycan?

It should also be noted that armor gets better if you have lifesteal.

The most effective HP/armor combinations are still hard to calculate, since it's hard to compare them gold-wise,
while pure HP is also obviously worth more because of magical damage.

But assuming 1 armor = 25 hp in terms of gold, with a=armor, h=hp after receiving the magic damage you expect to receive:

25 × a+16.7 / h = 1, or as a rule of thumb:

4 × h / 100 = a + 17  -  multiply your HP after receiving all the magic damage you expect with 4 and subtract the first few digits of that by 17, to get the optimal amount of armor.



**EHP gain due to damage reduction or evasion**: 1/(1-dr) - 1

Keep in mind that this percentage is based on your EHP, not your HP making it much better than just armor.
If you have both evasion and damagereduction from some ability they obviously stack multiplicatively, which also means they get increasingly effective,
for example a Void tethered to a Wisp has his EHP increased by 1/0.75 × 1/0.8 - 1 = 66%, if you add 35% evasion the EHP increase becomes 1/0.75/0.8/0.65 - 1 = 156%, while just 35% evasion gives only 1/0.65-1 = 54% EHP increase.

This also works with damage increase (~ negative damagereduction), e.g. Soulcatcher reduces you EHP by 1/1.5-1 = -33%, MoM by 1/1.3-1 = -23%.

Since lifesteal does grant you essentially a damagereduction of (lifesteal × your DPS / enemy DPS) while attacking, you can calculate your EHP gain from that as well.
This also means that lifesteal gets increasingly effective, e.g. 30% lifesteal is more than twice as good as 15% lifesteal (in terms of EHP gain). (That doesn't mean you should rush Vlads and Satanic on Skeleton King, though.)
Note that reducing incoming damage therefore gets better with lifesteal.

A bit off topic, but this also means that Rubick's Null Field gets increasingly effective, while his Telekinesis scales much worse, making me wonder why support Rubicks (in pro games)
max Telekinesis before Null Field, despite how absurdly good Null Field is in the midgame, since by the time a support Rubick is lvl 14 magic damage probably isn't
that significant anymore, while being a major source of damage when he's 9. I'd love too see his winrate when Null Field is maxed over Telekinesis, as I'm convinced
it would be higher than his winrate when maxing Telekinesis over NF.



**DPS increase of attack speed vs damage**

DPS increase of one extra AS = dmg/BAT

DPS increase of one extra dmg = (100+AS)/BAT

relative effectiveness of one AS compared to one dmg  =  dmg / (100+as)

and of one dmg compared to one AS = (100+as) / dmg

Also scales linearly. This is why AS is so important on tiny, since he can easily reach a relative effectiveness AS/dmg of 3 (in which case the DPS increase by for example an activated MoM would be the same as the DPS increase of a Rapier).

Another example, to further clarify what this means: if you do 325 damage per hit and have no IAS (increased attack speed) other than from your agility and 50 agility, one AS is worth 325/150=2.1667 damage and one damage is worth 150/325=0.462 AS, so the DPS increase of a Hand of Midas and a Battlefury would be the same (2.1667*30=65).

So assuming AS is gold wise worth the same as dmg, you want your damage to be your attack speed + 100 for the most costefficient DPS.

This also means that for roughly comparing different item's DPS potential, you can just add the attack speed and damage they give (since their relative effectiveness can be the same).



**DPS increase due to armor reduction**

a = armor, b = minus armor

if the final armor is above zero, the DPS increase is:

(1+0.06×a) / (1+0.06×(a-b)) - 1

if the final armor is below zero (but above the minimum of armor):

(1+0.06×a) × (2-.94^(b-a)) - 1

It stacks multiplicatively with crit, which makes using both quite effective.



**Damage block compared to armor**

d = enemy damage, b = block, a = armor, x = extra armor

to compare the worth of extra armor with damage block:

d = b×(3a+3x+50)/3x, and

x = (3a+50)×b/(3(d-b))

This means that damage block is more effective if your enemy's damage is low and your armor (or other damagereduction sources) is high (since it essentially adds a multiplicatively stacking damage reduction of block/damage).

For example, to compare the damage block from Vanguard (b=40*0.7=28, assuming the chance of blocking damage is actually 0.7) with an early Platemail (x=10), you can use the following graph:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=28*%283*a%2B30%2B50%29%2F30+for+a%3D0+to+20

(It shows when both are equal in EHP gain, depending on received damage and your armor,
in the area below the graph the 28 damageblock is more effective, above it 10 extra armor is more effective)

Personally I think this makes Vanguard a terrible item and I can honestly not see a situation where it is superior to an Armlet (which gives more HP, a lot of damage and more regen, while only costing 375 gold more), or even a Vitality Booster + Stout + HoIW (Helm of Iron Will) (which can be turned into a Heart and Satanic or Armlet eventually, while a Vanguard is almost worthless lategame).
I don't have enough experience to say how much a better a RoH is than a HoIW for laning, though.

For the latter combination the graph looks as follows:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+244%2F3%2B%2816+a%29%2F5+for+a+%3D+0+to+20



**DPS increase of MKB (Monkey King Bar) truestrike with m = misschance**: 1 / (1-m) - 1

for m = 0.25: 33%

for m = 0.35: 53.8%

This means if you have only a 25% chance to miss, with enough damage a Daedalus might actually be better dps wise than a MKB.
Realistically this point can't be reached though, but it means that Daedalus is only slightly worse against a target with 25% evasion, while being much better against other targets.



**DPS increase of Daedalus with another crit** (all skills maxed out)

PA: 0.15×4.5+0.25×0.85×2.7+0.85×0.75 = 1.886, 		1.886/1.525 = 1.237

Juggernaut: 0.25×2.7+0.35×0.75×2+0.75×0.65 = 1.6875, 	1.6875/1.35 = 1.25

SK: 0.15×2.75+0.25×0.85×2.7+0.75×0.85 = 1.628, 		1.628/1.26  = 1.29

CK: 0.1×3+0.9×0.25×2.7+0.9×0.75 = 1.5825		1.5825/1.2  = 1.32

Second Daedalus: (1-0.75^2 )×1.7 + 1 = 1.74375		1.744/1.425 = 1.224


So if true strike isn't an issue, the points where 2 Daedalus give the same DPS as a Daedalus and a MKB are as follows (a=attack speed, d=damage when you already have a Daedalus, assuming the bash damage is physical and gets amplified by crits, which should be true for ranged heroes):

(100+a)×(d+81)×1.224 = (115+a)×(123+d), resulting in the following graph (x-Axis = attack speed, y-Axis = damage):

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28321720%2B1815+a%29%2F%28560%2B17+a%29+from+a%3D0+to+a%3D300

In the area above the graph a second Daedalus is more effective, below it a MKB is.

For PA the equation for getting a Daedalus above MKB is: (assuming the bash is in fact magical and does not get amplified by crits, I don't really know that much about mechanics)

(100+a)×(d+81)×1.886 = (115+a)×(88+d)×1.525+(115+a)×35, resulting in this graph:

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2818+%28232300%2B913+a%29%29%2F%2813225%2B361+a%29+from+a%3D0+to+a%3D300

Note that MKB gets a bit better if the enemy has very high armor (because of the magic damage), but still, this means that a Daedalus is almost always better on PA than a MKB if the truestrike is not needed.
A Daedalus also makes PA more stable, the chance for critting becomes 1-0.85×0.75 = 36.25%.

(This is done without PRD (Pseudo Random Distribution), but based on a few simulations the numbers seem to be almost the same - based on the assumption that both counters work independently and that both reset when both crit.)


**Crystal Maiden's Freezing field average DPS**

Inside a 685-215 = 470 radius you'll get hit by an average of (215/685)^2 ×10 = 0.99 explosion per second, so the DPS is roughly 105/170/250

Outside that radius the chance of getting hit decreases until it is zero at 685+215 = 900, while being slightly below half at 685.

I'm not really in the mood for integration right now, so I didn't calculate the exact DPS depending on the distance from the center,
but if someone wants to know it I might do it. (It's really easy, I'm just really lazy)



**Ogre Magi's Fireblast average damage depending on Multicast level**

1: 275×(1+0.25) = 343.75

2: 275×(1+0.2+0.2×2) = 440

3: 275×(1+0.25+0.125×2+0.125×3) = 515.625

Today I want to talk about less subtle things that I notice in pubs, which often results in a game that might not go as one expects to. Let's start with picks, it's no secret that many new/bad players will pick carry/mid characters in excess. This is a big mistake, as carries NEED farm, and out of 3 lanes and jungle, there isn't enough farm to go around for more than 2 carries(Unless you go snowballing from the start, but that is another issue). So next time you see that your team has 3 carries, don't pick a carry. Chances are, support or some other class that you are missing will make a much bigger impact than 4th carry. 


Another thing I often see is people being ganked and complaining that there are no wards. Wards cost ~150 gold for 2 wards, being killed ~250. Even if you are antimage, and your team doesn't want to ward, buy the wards. They going to save you AND your allies gold, might even spot low-hp enemy hero, and get a kill. When I queue with friends that are new to Dota, it is very visible, and often, despite being ganked over and over again they refuse to buy wards because ""thats not their job"".


Another example of this, would be enemies having an observer ward to prevent ganking. I seen people going up to 4(!) times to try to gank, only to fail every time. If you see this, 200 gold sentry will solve this problem, and most probably will payoff with the next kill. Also, smokes counter wards, don't forget about that, they are even cheaper than sentries! 
This might be a little basic for some players, but if a new player will start doing just those 2 things, he will improve a lot.

PS: Also TP! Always carry it. Always.
I might write a guide on good support (Line equilibrium, both with pulls and with denies; Map awarness (what to look for); What to do (I.e not wasting time), etc). Would people be interested? 


**TL;DR**: If you see that your team needs something, but won't do, do it yourself. Especially when it comes to warding.",Tip,False,,t5_2s580,1374421805.0,tip,,True,t3_1ir2ri,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1ir2ri/how_to_become_a_little_better_at_dota/,

- What happens if someday a pro-team gets a girl in their roster ? Can you have a mixed team ? 

- There is much latent sexism in such a behavior, that imho doesn't help promoting the game to a feminine audience; women are given a special treatment because they are females.
 I think they should be treated as equals.

I had a crappy connection back then, so I almost only played against bots, and I only learned the VERY basics of the game. 

When HoN came around in closed beta, I started playing that, and found it much easier to learn what goes where, what goes with whom, and generally delete most of the terrible decisions I've been making. 

In HoN after a couple of years, I had around 900-1200 games played (can't really remember) but it changed SO much from what it was before into something of its own, that it didn't appeal to me in the same way any longer. During this time, I tried LoL a couple of times, and to me, it is really just a casual version with features affecting balance and I really didnt like that. I am more of a play-to-win than a play-for-fun guy. It's probably since I've been playing a lot of soccer and basketball and other team related IRL sports.

Last summer just before the international, I started playing some Dota 1 games again, and I suddenly had this awsome flashback of remembering the names of the characters, which heroes I hated and which I loved to play and so on, and I only remember some of the heroes and had learnt new ones, thanks to HoN. 

When The International went live, I didn't work for 2 days. I watch every single game that was played and I was so excited about the game and couldnt wait getting my hands dirty and play some real Dota again. I recorded the first hero picking screen with fraps and uploaded it to YouTube as the first real Dota2 footage on YouTube ever (nerd points) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jypDErOqIrc

To get to the point, I want to say that Dota 2 is just what I expect and want from a game and a developer. A great experience interacting with the game, both inside and outside of the client, a great community with it, a general higher medium level of gameplay (compared to HoN and LoL), patches with phenomenal content and everything else that I havent mentioned. 

I don't know, I just wanted to spill my guts and say I love Dota 2 and Valve, it's a great game that comes with a great developer and it's brilliant in all ways.

**TL;DR** I played Dota1, HoN and LoL, but Dota2 is superior. I love Valve and Dota2.

So cast thunder strike and at the very end of the spell cast glimpse on them, you should have a much easier time anticipating their location for kinetic field and static storm since they'll be at the location where you cast thunder strike on them.

Merlini mentioned this during the Team Liquid vs ??? match earlier and it just seemed so effective I wanted to share it for people who weren't watching.

I just want to share my latest project with you, called Invoker Game.
Take a look at it here http://www.invokergame.com !

I've had a lot if fun with Invoker Trainer, but felt that it could be a lot better, so I decided that i would make my own improved version of it.

This is the first time I publish it, so please feel free to ""beta/bug-test"" it, and if you have any suggestions or things you would like to see, please let me know :)

If you like this please **upvote it**, and help me spread/share it. its possible to Like on facebook etc. on the page!




**About the game**

If your familiar with Invoker Trainer, this is kind of the same, but with an improved interface and personal high scores!
So far, it has 4 game modes!

* Classic - In this mode you have to invoke 10 spells as fast as your possible can! Result will show how fast you made it!
* Combo - In this mode you have to invoke and use as many different spell combinations you can in 30 seconds! Result shows how many combos you managed to make!
* Hattrick - Basically the same as Combo, but you need to use 3 spells to finish a combo, which means you are forced to invoke at least one new spell after you've used the first 2
* Endless - Same as Classic but without a limit, just for playing around.





**Future plans**


I think there is a lot of further potential in this, The most obvious think would be to put in a tutorial mode which basically learns you how invoker work. And also add game modes that actually puts you in situations where you have to do different stuff to move on (history mode).. which would property help a lot of people to better understand invoker and how he can be used.


Let me know what you think!


**Updates**

* Legacy Hotkeys Added
* Random Gamemode Added and more stats
* **Survival Gamemode Added!** Give this a try and let me know what you thing! Personally my favorit by far!! :)

Together, we've helped to significantly increase the prize pool when the world's greatest Dota2 teams square off in less than 2 weeks.  

As an incentive, Valve created tiered rewards when the prize pool hit certain marks for those who bought compendiums. Recently, various immortal items were released as a part of this and given out to compendium owners. What followed was a surge of ill feelings about the items received. Many people began complaining because they didn't get the item they wanted or it didn't have a special effect with it. It's been like seeing a child's birthday where they get many gifts they enjoy (courier, HUD, taunts, fantasy Dota, 1v1 tournament) but then get one item they aren't happy with (immortal item) and act like their entire birthday is ruined. I think it has been forgotten that we reviewed these items for free as a ""thank you,"" and how much we've already received for free. Yes, we were promised these items when we hit a certain tier, but buying the compendium in no way guaranteed that goal would be reached. I also think that most of us would have still bought the compendium even if the immortal item wasn't offered and we need to remember that it's a gift.  

There are most likely people willing to trade for the item you received for one that you'd be more happy with. We've been given much in return for our support for this year's International and let's do our best as a community to show why it's the greatest eSports event of the year.",Shoutout,False,,t5_2s580,False,shout,,True,t3_1j5w09,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1j5w09/lets_not_forget_why_we_bought_a_compendium/,

1344178589.0,578,self.DotA2,xpryl,"joinDOTA, you're the front of the Dota2 community, and your website sucks.",The_Auditor,870,292,249,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/xpryl/joindota_youre_the_front_of_the_dota2_community/,"Could you please improve your website. I literally have no idea what's going on in the dota2 world informationally, because I cannot find it easily on your website. As the 'main' tournament and dota2 streaming portal, it's your responsibility to provide these things to the viewers. It will benefit the organization moreso than the fans as well through increased ad revenue, viewership and building your website to be the premier website for dota2. Yes, I am directly comparing to joinDOTA to TeamLiquid for SC2, because their website is damn good.

Things that I believe need to be improved:

* Tournament Tab - How many tournaments happen in dota on a monthly basis, you don't cover them in your tournament tab. Why not? Link brackets for major tournaments in your tournament tab, where it's easy to find. Why do I have to go to a new website to look at the Defense brackets. What about GosuMM, BTS, proDOTA tournaments. I can't find those on your website. I have no idea who's in those tournaments and what their schedule is.
* Vods - unorganized as hell. I would prefer to actually get rid of the vods tab and incorporate it into the tournaments tab, where I can choose which tournament I want, then which vods I want. I don't want to sift through 21 mixed tournament vods per page to find the specific match/tournament I'm looking for. 
* Livestreams - Separate out casting and playing - I have no idea whether draskyll is casting a game or streaming, so I have to actually click on his stream and load it in order to figure it out. TeamLiquid does this amazingly by listing the event and streamers under it.
* Schedule/Event View - Upcoming Broadcasts is good, but I have to manually change away from the streams minitab to view it. I often forget about it like that. Separate out the upcoming broadcasts to be above matches in it's own tab so a quick glance and I have a schedule of broadcasts for the next 7 days and I clan plan accordingly to view what I want. Currently right now, I literally wake up on Saturday/Sunday and am left wondering if/when a tournament is taking place.
* News section - this is pretty good. The 'Main' news (currently ProDOTA) needs to be desperately improved. An Information Tab should be the first one. Teams/Groups should be incorporated into a Brackets Tab. Vods - needs vods of the tournament specifically, not linking directly to the vods tab. Rules can be incorporated into the information tab. Streams can go away, it's useless. Also have a schedule tab and forum link for discussion.
* Forums - I don't use the forums so I won't comment. 
* Wiki - You should link to the dota2 wiki or try to create your own. This is essential for viewing old information or even current information. Team Liquid does this amazingly, and it's often the first thing that is updated after a match is currently going on. I don't watch SC2 anymore, but I do follow tournament results. If I wouldn't be able to find the information easily, I wouldn't look for it. This is the same with Dota2. I would say I am somewhere between a casual and hardcore viewer. If I miss a tournament it doesn't bother me, but with the current state of the website, I'm not going to bother trying to find vods for a specific tournament, unless it's recommended on Reddit because it takes 5-10 minutes just to FIND the vods.
* Layout - The website does not utilize my widescreen monitor at all. 50% of my screen is unused. This makes it ugly and harder to read.

These are just some suggestions to help improve the website. By improving the website, more traffic will generate, and more ad revenue. TeamLiquid does this by having volunteers write much of the content and having up to the minute results for ongoing events.",,False,,t5_2s580,1344182842.0,,teamnavi,True,t3_xpryl,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/xpryl/joindota_youre_the_front_of_the_dota2_community/,

It's just a cauldron with a bit of smoke coming out, where Kunkka and Venge get badass custom animations? And pudge gets a custom hook and rope? You can't even see the cauldron in ultimate form (which you're bound to spend a ton of time in). I get that you guys [Valve] are insanely busy right now but I think I can safely assume that everyone would rather you take a little longer to release something a bit more substantial. We did literally fund you millions. Could we maybe get a custom bear to go with it or something (and for Abba, maybe a custom mount)?

EDIT: Kunk[k]a

EDIT2: Just want to be clear to everyone, I am not unhappy with the fact I got a free item. If the LD cauldron  was the only immortal released I would have been slightly underwhelmed but that's it. However, because there are other items that a *vast* majority of people find cooler (myself included), I am disappointed. It's NOT about being owed something it's about *equality*, and how anticlimactic this was for me after being so excited to reach this huge compendium goal. I am still 100% satisfied with my compendium purchase and very proud to contribute to the TI3 prize pool.

Though this still holds true to a very small extent, the game is fucking difficult in 99999 different ways. However, i found something else about dota2 that has made me fall in love. Its everything AROUND the game. the achievements, skins, player cards, updates, god like lightning speed bug fixes, support, and the entire UI. The UI is AMAZZINGGGGGG, i can watch live pro players perspective and i can see their cursor!! The game just barely came out too. I've never felt so betrayed by blizzard after seeing this compared to battle.net 2.0. Also, Playing meepo gives me my daily high apm fix. 



edit: one more thing i want to add, though this may be negative to some, i love it when a game updates frequently, even if it is small. bnet 2.0, rarely updated and when they did it never made a difference to me. dota 2 feels like it is constantly updating itself with new content like player models, tutorials, balance changes, bug fixes, etc. i will acknowledge that there is bias because the game was in beta, but as of now im loving the updates. i hope it can stay this way forever!

The Swedes receive 9,398,035.65 krona and the Ukrainians receive 5,131,665.44 Hryvnia

using [the big mac indexes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index) of Ukraine and sweden of 2012

9,398,035.65 krona will purchase **191,796.65** big macs and 5,131,665.4 hryvnia will purchase **285,092.52** big macs.  



936,625.50 ringgits (malysian currency) will buy 127,432 big macs so Orange didn't do too bad themselves.

Obviously these numbers are before taxes (DBL EDIT: **According to rumors on Reddit** valve might cover these. NO one has sauce) and Big mac index does have it's flaws... But I thought this was kind of neat.

Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I just wanted to say how good a job I think Valve is/has been doing with Dota 2. 

Personally I've gone through the trenches of matchmaking from 2 years ago to playing in very high now, and while I've occasionally felt frustrated with the matchmaking, I've never thought the system was flawed and am completely happy with it. I've yet to see a cosmetic set  in game that is truly distracting and affects my performance or ability to play, or immersion in the game for that matter. I have been perfectly content with the WEEKLY patch updates which not only listen and respond to the community (Allowing new players to watch matches before tutorials and also spectator ward vision in this last patch alone) but also feel like quality work is getting done. On top of all this they are continually preparing for the biggest event in esports history and are handling it fantastically with the compendiums and everything that goes along with them. 

Sure, not everything is perfect. The old mute system was awful, and the way they decided to distribute the immortal items does seem unfair. But these are slight inadequacies that pale in comparison to the great work that is being done at Valve.

So, I wanted to make a thread praising valve for taking a game from my childhood and turning it into a game that is so so much more. I for one can't wait to see the further developments in a game I love by a company I respect, and I just wanted to see if anyone felt the same way.",Shoutout,False,,t5_2s580,1374932103.0,shout,,True,t3_1j5qlg,http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1j5qlg/well_played_valve/,

THE INTERNATIONAL 3



That's right, the group stages are starting, let's trend the heck out of DOTA2's biggest event to date on Twitter!

So here's what we are gonna do:

Everyday (Starting today), tweet anything dota2 related and add #TI3 and mention @DOTA2. Keep this up till the Grand Finals!

e.g. NAVI FOR CHAMPIONS 2013! #TI3 #HYPETRAIN @DOTA2


To lend my personal support, I will be giving 2 El Gatos and up to 4 Compendiums to a total of 6 different people with the best tweets at the end of the Group Stages. (READ: 6 individual winners total)

But if you want to get the items just mention me in the tweet as well :) @LysanderXonora

(Im not as rich as dpm sry)


GO GO GO

The world will hear us.
Long Live the International!

So Gabe Newell just came down to the University of Texas at Austin where I attend and [gave a talk](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2013/01/28/gabe-newell-on-productivity-economics-political-institutions-and-the-future-of-corporations-29th-january-university-of-texas/) concerning the economics and direction of Valve and where he thinks that they, their games, and their entire industry is going. He spent a little time talking about a few things Dota 2 releated, such as his reflections on Na'vi (specifically Dendi), its future in eSports, and even an explanation for why they instituted the privacy settings in response to Dotabuff's DBR.

It would take me a little while to edit, so I just want to see if people would like to hear about it so I know whether or not to go through the trouble.

**EDIT:** Here's a photo I took from my seat 10 feet away from him: http://imgur.com/z2UAdLm

**EDIT 2:** I'm getting a lot of messages in my inbox saying this was a stupid thread and a blatant karma-whoring attempt, so let me explain: Since most of the presentation was about Valve's corporate economics and Gabe's reflections on the future of gaming, Dota 2 was NOT the main focus of the talk (even though it did come up). Because of that, I was afraid I might be breaking the subreddit rules by not being relevant -- hence why I posted this. As for the karma-whoring, this is a self-post on a throwaway account for that very reason. Sorry for making this more difficult than it had to be. I'll start working on it.

**EDIT 3:** I contacted the people in charge to ask if it would be alright for me to post what I had recorded to Reddit, and they weren't exactly... encouraging. In order to avoid potential legal repercussions to myself, I'm currently working with them to figure something out, and I think you will all be pleased with the solution in the end. Don't worry: OP will deliver.
