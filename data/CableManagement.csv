http://www.overclock.net/t/871183/guide-how-to-sleeve-a-psu-power-cord

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------




This guide is not by any means the definitive guide and/or the only way to go about sleeving your PSU cord, but is by far the one of the easiest ways to go about it.

**!!! A word of warning, your are sleeving a POWER cord, so please if you are not confident that you will hook it back up properly then do not attempt it. Also, please take the proper safety precautions. !!!**

This is a two part guide. The first part I will show you how to sleeve your cable using an IEC Connector. In the second part I will show you how to sleeve your cable and keep the original plugs.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**-Part 1 : IEC Connector Guide-**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This part will be the guide on how to sleeve your PSU power cable using IEC connectors found many places, but can be found cheaply on ebay. (search for IEC connector)

**You will need a few things to get your sleeving project done.**

*1. PSU Power Cord*

*2. Scissors*

*3. IEC Connectors*

*4. Sleeveing of your choice and heatshrink (preferably 3:1)*
Please note that the sleeving will need to be a little bigger than the diameter of the psu cord your are using, as well as the heatshrink needs to be slightly bigger than your psu cord with the sleeving on it. (I used 1/8th Clean *Cut and 1/8th PET with 1/4th 3:1 adhesive lined heatshrink and 1/8th 4:1 adhesive lined heatshrink for the inner wires)*

*5. Lighter/ Heat Source for heatshrink.*

*6. Electrical Tape/Masking*

*7. Optional exacto-knife*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lets get started.**



http://img255.imageshack.us/img255/9962/dsc03316s.jpg
Here are my connectors, you may find them at this link. These are just the ones I used for this project and I am not affiliated with this ebay seller in any way.
P-037 Rhodium-plated US Power Plug &amp;C-037 IEC Connector


You will notice that these will be very sturdy as they have screws clamping everything down in multiple places, they even come with a add on piece of plastic that allows you to use smaller guage cord and keep it secure.


http://img254.imageshack.us/img254/3001/dsc03318n.jpg
You will want to take them apart by the two securing screws, and you will notice they are well built. And they look cool too!


http://img814.imageshack.us/img814/9329/dsc03319g.jpg
And here is our victim…erm I mean cord.


http://img515.imageshack.us/img515/1797/dsc03320jw.jpg
Simply cut the ends with a scissors.


http://img269.imageshack.us/img269/3751/dsc03321hi.jpg
Like so.


http://img708.imageshack.us/img708/4104/dsc03323v.jpg
Now you will want to strip down the ends about an inch, and then the ends of the wires just a bit.


http://img291.imageshack.us/img291/3577/dsc03324a.jpg
Now we will start the sleeving process. It is always best to tape the end you will be putting the sleeve on as it will catch on the wires. Remember to measure your sleeving with the fact that it might shrink some as the actual length will shrink due to the sleeving being expanded.


http://img443.imageshack.us/img443/167/dsc03325h.jpg
I used clean cut sleeving but the choice is endless, if it fits over the wire your golden. I melted the ends just a tad to make sure it didn’t fray like crazy when I put it on the cord.


http://img64.imageshack.us/img64/9260/dsc03326d.jpg
See! No fray!

http://img406.imageshack.us/img406/3416/dsc03327rs.jpg

This isn’t really a step, but I almost double sleeved the cord for a blue black effect but decided against it.


http://img825.imageshack.us/img825/1914/dsc03328f.jpg
Go ahead and put the back of the plug on and a small amount of heatshrink, we will use this to seal up the cord end for the sleeving, this might not be needed but it adds a nice effect because of the clear casing.


http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/9704/dsc03329du.jpg
Cut up small pieces of heatshrink, small enough to cover just the exposed individual cables but not the exposed wire. (again this is for looks only and is not really needed)


http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/6180/dsc03330a.jpg
Shrink them on, if you look close twards the middle of the wires you will still be able to tell what color the wires are.


http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/8500/dsc03331ye.jpg
At this point I made a diagram of where the wires went, the key here is to make sure that what ever color wire you put on one side has to be the same color in the same spot on the opposite end!

Go ahead and put the wires in and make sure they are screwed tight!


http://img25.imageshack.us/img25/358/dsc03334mj.jpg
Shrink up the exposed area of color on the wires and your sleeving at the same time. Nice and clean!


http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/7205/dsc03336c.jpg
Put it all together and this is where you get to notice those little details that cleaned up the plug, if we would have left the colored wires they would have shown through.


http://img411.imageshack.us/img411/6422/dsc03338a.jpg
Go ahead and follow the steps for the opposite side, please make sure to tighten all screws including the ones at the base of the bottom of the plug, that will make sure you can’t pull your plug out of the end.


http://img808.imageshack.us/img808/5737/dsc03340jh.jpg

http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/3848/dsc03341u.jpg

http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/7665/dsc03342l.jpg


Here is another possible combo by lovesan.
http://img651.imageshack.us/img651/4215/dscf5048e.jpg


And there you have it the final project, the color combos are endless. This is a cheap and easy mod anyone can do. And it will add a nice touch to any computer.


 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**-Part 2 : Keeping the OEM Connector-**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**You will need a few things to get your sleeving project done.**

*1. PSU Power Cord*

*2. Scissors*

*3. Soldering Iron &amp; Solder*

*4. Sleeveing of your choice and heatshrink (preferably 3:1)
Please note that the sleeving will need to be a little bigger than the diameter of the psu cord your are using, as well as the heatshrink needs to be slightly bigger than your psu cord with the sleeving on it. (I used 1/8th Clean Cut and 1/8th PET with 1/4th 3:1 adhesive lined heatshrink and 1/8th 4:1 adhesive lined heatshrink for the inner wires)*

*5. Lighter/ Heat Source for heatshrink.*

*6. Electrical Tape*

*7. Optional exacto-knife*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Lets get started.**




http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/2206/sleevi001.jpg
We will start with your standard PSU power cable.


http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/4232/sleevi002.jpg
Measure out the sleeving to the cord from one end (where the plug starts and the cord ends) to the other end and set the peice of sleeving aside.


Make the first cut about 5 inches up from the plug that goes into the wall.


Using your scissors in a circular motion very softly and carefully cut the outer layer, let the scissors do the cutting for you. When you notice you are through the outer layer stop.


Make the second cut about 4 more inches down in the same fashion.


http://img13.imageshack.us/img13/2854/sleevi003.jpg
Using either an exacto-knife or the tip of the scissors cut a slit down the outer layer of the cord until you can pull on it and split it down to your other cut.


http://img441.imageshack.us/img441/2737/sleevi004.jpg
Cut your wires in a staggering pattern.

Like so:

----/------------------

-----------/-----------

-------------------/---



http://img338.imageshack.us/img338/7353/sleevi006.jpg
Take the piece of sleeving we measured out earlier and put it on the longer side of the cord and push it back until its about an inch out of the way and then tape it with the electrical tape so it doesn't move.


http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/281/sleevi007.jpg
Slide on your two pieces of heatshrink.


http://img695.imageshack.us/img695/8162/sleevi008.jpg
I prefer to shrink the opposite end just to have it done with, but this step can be done at the end as well.


http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/7522/sleevi009.jpg
Twist your wires together making sure to put a piece of heatshrink on beforehand.


http://img232.imageshack.us/img232/5228/sleevi010.jpg
Solder each wire. (if you are good at soldering you can tin the wires straight like a pro solderer


http://img24.imageshack.us/img24/7986/sleevi011.jpg
Shrink the heatshrink and give the wire a slight twist to bunch them together like so.


http://img404.imageshack.us/img404/7458/sleevi012.jpg
While they are twisted tape it tightly with electrical tape or heatshrink, being carefull not to use too much so we don't make a huge bump in the cord.


http://img832.imageshack.us/img832/1615/sleevi013.jpg
Pull the electrical tape off the sleeving and push it all the way to the end of the plug tightly (where the cord ends and the plug starts) and shrink the heatshrink.


http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/9199/sleevi014.jpg
Enjoy your cord.


http://img152.imageshack.us/img152/9857/sleevi015.jpg
Pet works great as well but I would put a black sleeve underneath for a cleaner look.

http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/8150/sleevi016.jpg


I hope this has helped those that were curious how this was done. I am sure there are many methods to get to the same goal. So if there is any suggestions please speak up and I will add them to the OP.


Thanks for your time.

1341160552.0,45,self.CableManagement,vvt56,We're having our very first r/cablemanagement contest and it's sponsored bt NZXT!,harpuajim25,59,14,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/vvt56/were_having_our_very_first_rcablemanagement/,"Thanks to all of you who have grown this community well beyond any of our expectations.  The information and builds featured here have been superb and an behalf of all the mods at r/cablemanagement I say thank you!

Now to the contest:

The contest is for all the builders out there who strive for a clean build but their cases won't allow it. Basically, who can do the best cable management job in a case with limited or no cable management options. 

The rules are:

1.  The case must cost less than $40

2.  The case can not have any cable management holes on the motherboard tray or anywhere else.  If you drill the holes yourself that's ok but none from the manufacturer are allowed.

3. All builds must feature a video card with at least one PCIe connector.

4. Modular and non-modular PSUs are both accepted but builds with a non-modular will receive a 10% bonus in votes.

5. (Edit)  Please include a picture of the back panel in your submission.

Before I announce the prizes, I would like to thank Rob Teller AKA NZXT_Retell for helping us contact the right people to make this all possible. Without his help this contest would not exist. Thanks again, Rob!

Prizes:

1st place- Switch 810 SE Matte Black + Starter Kit, 2M Sleeved Kit, NZXT Shirt

2nd Place – Starter Kit, 2M Sleeved Kit, NZXT Shirt

3rd Place – Starter Kit, NZXT Shirt

If you haven't seen this case yet, I strongly suggest taking a look at it on [nzxt.com](http://www.nzxt.com/new/products/crafted_series/switch_810) because it is incredible.  The [Starter Kit](http://www.nzxt.com/new/products/premium_cables/starter_kit) and [2M LED Kit](http://www.nzxt.com/new/products/case_accessories/sleeved_led_kit_-_blue) are also fantastic prizes.  And best of all, all the winners get an [NZXT shirt](http://www.nzxt.com/new/news_detail.php?id=259) :D. Not sure which one it will be but really, who cares?  They're all awesome!

You can submit your build on this thread throughout the entire month of July.  At the end of the month the voting will take place and the winners will be decided!  When submitting your build, it's not mandatory to post the specs as well since it's really the cables that are important but if you want to, be my guest ;)  

If you have any questions about the contest please don't post them in this thread; they will be deleted. Instead, send us a message in [modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FCableManagement) and ask away. 

Good luck to all who enter and thanks again to NZXT to making this all possible. Have a great July!

**Edit 1:**  If you could, add a name to your build so we can use it in the title when the voting begins. If not, your build will just be titled at (Username)'s Build.

**Edit 2:**  Since the prizes are being shipped from us and not NZXT, all winners are responsible for the shipping costs of the prizes. The products will be shipped from the US via USPS.",,False,self,t5_2tdv7,1342173205.0,,fractal,True,t3_vvt56,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/vvt56/were_having_our_very_first_rcablemanagement/,moderator

Rationale:

* CPU - No Microcenters near me, would have been 200 dollars more to get an x79 CPU and socket. Based on some research (I'll just cite [this](http://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Intel/Ivy_Bridge_PCI-Express_Scaling/)) I didn't find it worth it. I could have done it to future proof, but, meh. Primarily for gaming so didn't need Hyper Threading on the i7.
* CPU Cooler - Wanted to go air, wanted the Noctua radiator design, despise the Noctua fan colors. replaced them with some Corsair SP HP fans (high static pressure) with a little engineering and hey, looks great with no loss of performance.
* Motherboard - I really liked the features (Built in wifi + bluetooth!), bells, and whistles of this mobo. I like the fact it uses mil spec components and comes with a little certificate from the person who burn tested it 24 hours before shipping. Yellow bits are completely hidden by the engine block and jet engines (video cards) so hey, no big.
* Memory - 8 gigs of memory for gaming. Black. Low profile to fit under the engine block. Done.
* Storage: Had a 2TB media drive, went with the standard 128gb Samsung 840 Pro. Not much to say.
* Video Card: Had good luck with XFX in the past, these were marked down when I got them, came with a bunch of games (although any 7970 would have). Matched the build. Lifetime warranty. Noticed a bit after I received them that bad reviews started to flood in on Newegg (did not get them from Newegg, but were 4 eggs when I got them). Not sure if Newegg got a bad batch or cards are crappy. Guess I'll find out and see if XFX is still all about it's lifetime warranty. Myself - I've had no issues, love these things.
* Case - Fractal R4. I love minimal, solidly build cases.
* Power Supply - Went with a gold standard brand. Got some individually sleeved cables from ModDIY.com instead of doing it myself. because the stock ones are ugly as hell and because in the equation of my life time &gt; money. Wanted customs because with extensions you still have the mess coming out of the power supply, and also I could specify 3 6 pin PCI-E cables (2 for the video cards, 1 for the extra PCI-E power on my mobo) and 2 8 pin PCI-E cables without having to worry about hiding the jumpers.
* OS: Windows 8 + Startisback. Glory.
* Monitor: Monoprice 30"" IPS. I originally got a 24"" 1080p 120hz monitor. I realized that 120hz meant nothing to me. Returned it, did some looking around, decided to jump in and get this bad boy. I regret nothing.
* Keyboard: Cooler Master Storm Quickfire Rapid, Cherry reds. Contrary to the terrible stock images on newegg or amazon, the cooler master branding is nowhere to be seen on this keyboard. Nice, clean.
* Other: Bose speakers my dad no longer wanted, Turtle Beach PX5 headset as a Christmas gift from the wife, Logitech G500 from my last build, and HP Laserjet 1200 printer. The best fucking printer this world has or will ever see.

Hope you enjoyed my build.

I’ve gotten to know many of you over the past year and I’ve been having a lot of fun socializing, giving advice, and sleeving extensions and power supplies to the members of reddit. Although I may not have much of a literal presence here, I’ve really come to enjoy visiting this subreddit. Seeing all of the work and dedication you folks put into your rigs provides me with the motivation to keep sleeving and find new ways to improve my cable management technique.

As a small token of my appreciation for being such a great community, I thought I’d do a giveaway this month. I’ve been collecting games over the course of the Steam Summer Sale, and have amassed 30 games in total to give away for this contest.

**Entry Requirements:**

There are 3 different entry categories for this contest. For each category I’ll be awarding 10 games. You can enter one, two, or all three of these categories, however, you will only be eligible to win 1 game.

1. Post your idea for a unique color scheme for a sleeved 24 pin motherboard cable. You can use [excel](http://i.imgur.com/zYpOl0P.jpg), [ms paint](http://i.imgur.com/6h68zwZ.jpg), or any other picture editing software to create the color scheme. Use any colors you see fit. Upload the picture through imgur and provide the link in your contest submission.

2. For those of you who have a non standard case design, post your build list from pcpp and provide time-stamped pictures of the inside of your case. Prizes will be awarded to those that have the best cable managed rig. Bonus points will be awarded to those who’ve used either semi or non modular psu’s. Non standard case designs include, but are not limited, to the following:
   - Cases with non standard motherboard mountings: ex. Rotated motherboard cases like the Silverstone Raven, or rATX cases like the Lian Li V1000
   - Mini ITX Cases
   - HTPC cases
   - LAN cases like the Cooler Master HAF XB

3. Post a cable management tip for the members of this subreddit in the form of a haiku. Points will be awarded based on wit and humor.

Built this Three Hundred for a client today. Seems to have turned out alright. Antec recently revised the 300 a bit. They ditched the Molex connectors for the fans in favor of the 3-pin style for motherboard fan headers. Also, in what I consider to be two VERY nice moves, they made the front PWR/RST/HDDLED/PWRLED cables into one very sleek black and grey flat cable, instead of a bunch of twisted pairs, and they also ditched the little AC97 extension to the front HDA cable. I've been cutting that stupid thing off for years. Seriously, when was the last time ANYONE manufactured a board with AC97? Shit, I think the last time I used that was on an AMD K6. 

Anyways, to cable this rig I first routed the fan cables and front accessory cables under the board. The risers give enough clearance to do this safely as long as you are cautious about routing your thicker USB/Audio cables away from sharp pins on the backside of the motherboard PCB, otherwise they will eventually pierce through and cause havoc. 

The CPU 12V was routed along the far left side and down, and the power for the drives was routed around to the front of the case before looping back inside to power them. 

For the sake of brevity I didn't cut holes in the chassis for the 24 pin like I do in some of my 300 builds (like my featured one on the right, thanks mods!) but instead elected to cable it up the side of the motherboard. There are two stamped cable mounts courtesy of Antec for this purpose, and I used about half dozen sticky mounts in addition to those. 

Specs, of course:

Intel i5-2500k

Gigabyte Z68A

8GB of Lifetime PC10600  (This RAM is amazing. Manufactured stateside in California, lifetime warranty, incredibly fucking stable. It's not high performance RAM per se, but it's plenty fast for most people.)

550W Antec Basiq PSU

EVGA GeForce GTX 550 Ti

1TB WDC Black HDD

128GB Crucial M4 SSD

Samsung DVD Burner

Windows 7 Pro x64

And, of course, our standard 4 year parts/labor warranty. ;)

I,Jobeanie123,24,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1f4fzj/people_with_a_650d_what_does_the_back_of_your/,"I want mine to be very clean both front and back, but I'm wondering just how yours looks!  

**Edit:** I? I what?!  

**Edit:** I've worked on it a bit! [Here](http://i.imgur.com/ra17cX0.jpg) is what it looks like so far. I don't quite know the exact length I need for the power and reset switch cables and USB and audio and whatnot, so I'll leave the tails on the zip ties for now. I'm going to be sticking with the default case fans for a while (apart from the top, that will be replaced with two 140mm fans, again probably the default ones that come with the H110 unfortunately). That main bundle of cables has some squaring up needed, but again I need their exact length. The one drooping down into the motherboard tray is going to be held up with a tab of hot glue to hold it reasonably taught, as with perhaps the ones on the left, the fan connector in the way of where the right latch goes, and the molex to keep it out of that little ""window."" Nothing crazy, just a small dab to hold it in place. That seems like the way to go. I can't wait to get the motherboard so I know how long those cables need to be!   

All the slack is in that 5.25"" drive bay area, I think I'll put a DVD drive in ""stealth"" mode there to keep the cables from showing. It certainly isn't a rats nest but it's not the prettiest thing now that they're looped a bit.  

Again, all the cables will use some squaring up and whatnot but I can't do that yet. Additionally, I ordered some white sleeved cables from corsair (yeah yeah I know I won't like them as much but I don't want to spend the extra money and time for a mediocre first set of cables, on a difficult AX series no less).   

All extra fan controller cables are under the hard drive cage (in the plastic thing) but I may remove that completely, hold the cage in the 5.25"" thing with a screw, and find a workaround for the cables.  

Anyway, that's all for now. ",,False,self,t5_2tdv7,1369713971.0,,corsair,True,t3_1f4fzj,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1f4fzj/people_with_a_650d_what_does_the_back_of_your/,

Its performance was 5 degrees C hotter than the Corsair H100i, and $50 cheaper. Being on the last leg of my budget (I had already spent ~$2000 on this computer), I opted for the Phanteks cooler. I do not want to keep this computer completely air cooler, though. I want to completely water cool it, aside from the RAM. My motherboard has built in chipset water cooling capabilities (it's the Maximus V Formula) but nothing else does. If I were to water cool my CPU, GPU, and motherboard, how much money am I looking at for a custom loop. I currently have no parts - i.e., no radiator or pump, etc. so I would have to buy everything. Where should I buy these parts from? Are there any resources online you can direct me to for learning more about water cooling? Thanks for all of your help - I am new to water cooling and would like to learn more.

**Top Submissions:**

- [HONEST_ABE_APPROVES](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cbbaxpd): I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful cable this user drew up in MS Paint: http://i.imgur.com/r6b2kDs.png . This was the only submission as well that had the front side color scheme different from the back, which i quite enjoy. The 3d render was alright too... i guess.

- [SausageLegs](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cb84ung): This was such a beautifully done haiku, couldn't help but to shed a tear. Well done!

- [schmintendo](http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1iueov/jappettos_steam_sale_giveaway_contest/cbae83u) - Your haiku gave me a good chuckle. Any chance you can show me some pics of your cable management?

Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a spot for Left 4 Dead 2 for the giveaway. A member on the irc channel at /r/buildapc has since claimed this.

For some reason, nobody asked for Serious Sam: BFE. If anybody would like this, let me know, and I'll gift it to whomever at random.

Anyways, thanks to everybody for their submissions! I'll be sure to do some more giveaways soon : )

P.S. In the next week or so I'd like to sleeve the ideas for color schemes posted to the contest. I'll be posting pictures when they're done so stay tuned!

Unfortunately I have a much bigger cable problem I haven't seen a lot of in your posts.  For years now I've dealt with monstrosities similar to this:

http://i.imgur.com/DLHoH7E.jpg

I'm going to be moving soon and want to create a cleaner, more organized cable setup for all my cables when I move into my new place. (Two monitors, mouse, keyboard, headset, speakers, power cables, etc.)

I don't need it to look super amazing, just like something other than a rat's nest behind my desk. xD  Most everything I've seen browsing this subreddit, though, is for inside the case. Is there a separate subreddit for external cable management or perhaps a External Cable Management 101 anyone could direct me to?

**Edited to add:** Between your guys' responses so far and googling it looks like the most difficult thing I'll have is finding an out of the way, neat place for my power strip and USB hub. I have a desk with a wooden top but and a metal back panel.  ([Here's what it actually looks like](http://imgur.com/xID16SH), if that was confusing.)The wooden top is not very deep on the back side of the metal panel and so mounting something like [this](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/images/products/signum-cable-management-horizontal__0117163_PE272460_S4.JPG) would be very difficult. I would like to look at mounting the power strip and perhaps the hub onto the back of the metal panel so it looks similar to this redditor's setup: 
http://i.imgur.com/MZjCw.jpg

I can't easily put any form of screws/holes into the metal panel; is it okay to use something like a double-sided adhesive strip to secure the power strip to the desk? Or is that a no-no?

By trade I'm an IT engineer, but evenings/weekends I own/operate a small print shop doing vehicle wraps, decals, banners, that sort of shit. Not going to lie, having access to a Roland VersaCamm SP540-v has its perks. 

 
The PC isn't anything special spec-wise. It was put together out of mostly used/displaced parts around our office, and the motherboard may have even been in our RMA pile (but the fucker works, so whatever). All it has to do is run Illustrator, Photoshop, and a few other programs, so it didn't have to be a beast. 

 
Cabling took a while. The Antec Three Hundred doesn't have any built in cable management options, like behind-board passthroughs or channels. Had to cut my own. Yeah, they should be grommeted to protect the wires, get over it. The SATA cables were cut to length and soldered for the hard drives. The CPU fan cable and the remote cables for front USB and power/reset/LED headers were cut to length and shrouded. All of the fans are soldered together so that there is only one Molex connection for them. 

 
*Yes, I am aware that the PSU is in upside down. There is a reason for that: At our office we oftentimes open up our PCs to show clients/potential clients the quality of our builds as we talk to them about purchasing from us. I wanted the TruePower logo facing out so they could see that we use high quality supplies. Most of the time, the case panel is off anyways, so I'm not super concerned about cooling.*

I am planning on building a computer in the next month or so and I am keen to make it as good as possible. What kind of ties or sleeving should I buy to make my build as aesthetically pleasing as possible, to get better airflow and to just generally keep cables easy to manage and out of the way? I was looking around online and it was all pretty confusing to me. It would be good to get a kind of black and red colour scheme going, but that doesn't matter too much.

Ill upload pics when I get the chance. 

I took a 10"" piece of Cat5e cable, and a 10"" piece of paracord. I cut about an inch off the end of the covering from the Cat5e, and wrapped the 8 strands with a piece of tape to hold them together. 

I then gutted the paracord, and slowly inserted the cat5e cable. As I kept pushing more Cat5e cable into the paracord I slid the Cat5e covering off the opposite side, eventually replacing it entirely with paracord. 

After the Cat5e cord was fully covered with its new paracord sleeve, I took a 1/2"" piece of heatshrink and put it over the cat5e and paracord, leaving about a 1/2"" of the end uncovered. After some positioning I applied heat to the heatshrink, then put the rj45 connector on the end of the cat5e cable. 

I have since been testing my network speed to check if replacing the covering on the cat5e cable would damage my connection, I have not yet found any evidence that my connection is being slowed. 

If I see no evidence of connection degradation over the next week or so, I'll do a longer piece.",,False,self,t5_2tdv7,False,,,True,t3_109lpm,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/109lpm/sleeving_cat5e_cable_with_paracord/,

I need help with cable managment. Everytime I open my PC I almost get sick.
In my mind it's not that bad but when seeing other builds mine looks terrible. Please don't be mean, scared or repost to /r/cringe. I would just like a couple suggestions/help or links to where I can fix this.

Here is a link to pictures of my setup: http://imgur.com/a/ldekg

When I built this come 2 1/2 to 3 years ago I didn't know anything about cable management. Now I feel like an idiot for having my PC like this. Any information would be helpful!
PS: If anyone has suggestions for build/setup I am willing to learn and make it better
Also any tips on external cable management would be great to! I bought some cable clips from Zellers for $0.50 that I should be using.
One more thing I forgot is I have a GTX680 (link below) is it worth it to install it into this computer? or should I just put it into my media PC (running 2 GTS450's). I think graphics isnt the limiting factor and would only be used as another heat source.

Sorry for the grainy pics as well, my apologies.

EDIT: I went ahead and used PCPP to do a quick rendition of the hardware. Also, I expect to expand my monitors to at least two 1440p or just two more 1080p monitors in the future. One of the cards were free, as well. The price of some parts were actually A LOT cheaper than what a consumer would generally pay.

Have a look!,Crasha,20,6,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/vjcsa/fixed_my_corsair_carbide_500r_have_a_look/,"[Build Log!](http://imgur.com/a/kStvE#0) Be sure to check it out on imgur, because the pictures are all commented for your viewing pleasure.

First let's get the materials out of the way. I used paracord from [theparacordstore.co.uk](http://www.theparacordstore.co.uk). 

I got heatshrink, a bit of Sata sleeving, as well as some brackets for cables from [MDPC](http://en.mdpc-x.com/). 

To get the pins out of the connectors, I used the Molex tool, also from MDPC. 

Thoughts one the whole thing? It was fun, but I wouldn't recommend doing something like this with a semi modular, or non-modular PSU. I had 3 or 4 times where I was afraid I had fucked up a wire beyond repair, and that's not a very nice feeling to have when you can't just replace the cable, but actually have to get a new PSU if you mess something up. I'm just happy it turned out as nice as it did. 

The heatshrink itself doesn't look quite as nice as I would have liked it to, but I attribute that to my lacking experience when I started the project. I also should have gotten a heat gun instead of shrinking it with a lighter. 

The PC is the one I posted posted[ here](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/ueg5q/build_complete_midhigh_gamer_dota2_streaming_also/) back when I'd just built it.

With the ODD tray in place there will be a tiny bit  of room on top to route cables and they have included spaces to bring the cables though. The problem is that the cables themselves are short and in the case of the SATA cables stiff and difficult to work with. 

I will be looking for some round cables to replace the OEM SATA cables that came with the motherboard, does anyone know of a brand that are supple and easy to work with?

I can already tell heat will be an issue so I am looking to add a 2nd 40mm fan to the front right vent as an intake but with the cable mess as it that will be mostly ineffective. So I am hoping to route as many to the top of the ODD tray as possible.

I havent used any extension cables (apart from one or two that came with the hardware). I would really appreciate advice, and any suggestions.

Thanks!

PS. Ill try to get better pictures, but that was with my phone.

**Update:** I've taken the tips into action but i still have lots of work to do. Im thinking about sleeving the cables? Just the simple ones, like fan cables, and the front panel connectors (like the orange blue, white weird cables). Whats the easiest way to do so? I know this is sort of ""ghetto"" but can i just wrap like the 4 inches of the visible cable in electrical tape? Im not talking about the whole cable, but rather just the visible part.

Edit: Nevermind about the electrical tape, it would look messy. I just wish all my wires were black :(. Yes, i could have bought a fully modular (sleeved) PSU, but they're too expensive where i live. Anyone got any suggestions? 

**Update 2:** With everyone's tips in mind, ive done more work to the cables. I think it looks a lot better than what it used to. I dont even have a picture of the original mess (trust me, it was bad). What do you guys think? Any other suggestions?

The posts have been great and the information being spread across this sub has been nothing but superb!  In a little over two weeks, we have gone from 60 readers to nearly 400!

That being said, you may have noticed something new here.  I have created a flair system that will help us show even more pride in our respective builds.  I tried to cover all the big name brands but if you don't see yours, let me know and I will gladly create it.  

Unfortunately, I was unable to find a 16x16 (or anything close in size) for Silverstone and Xclio.  If anyone has a link to either of these brand's logos, definitely PM me with the location!!

Thanks again, your support is much appreciated.

I used a few parts from my old build. I used the SSD the HDD. I bought a new keyboard and mouse. I love everything about my build. I'd probably change a thing or two, though - the monitor(which I might end up just buying an IPS and dual monitoring). I wound up getting faulty ram so that wasn't fun but other than that everything is great. 


I got custom extensions made by Reddit's own Jappetto. They were shipped a lot faster than I thought they would be. They were pretty much here before my parts haha. He did an awesome job. I would recommend again and I'm probably going to get more for friends builds in the future. He used the MDPC and the cables came out awesome and I think they look awesome in the case. (side note - I will be tightening the PCI-E when I put my new RAM in which is in the next few days so it'll look even better) Jappetto number 1

Hi all, I have the following combo (in my 2ish year-old build):

Type|Item|Price
:----|:----|:----
**Motherboard** | [MSI 870A-G54 ATX  AM3 Motherboard](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/msi-motherboard-870ag54) | Purchased For $0.00 
**Case** | [Corsair 500R White ATX Mid Tower Case](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/corsair-case-500rwt) | Purchased For $0.00 
**Power Supply** | [OCZ ModXStream Pro 600W 80 PLUS Certified ATX12V / EPS12V Power Supply](http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/part/ocz-power-supply-ocz600mxsp) | Purchased For $0.00 

I recently upgraded my case to the 500r, and the issue arose: the 8-pin cable can't reach behind the mobo and up to the connection near the top. Currently it's stretching across the video card, looking ugly and placing a slight amount of strain on the video card.

Is there an option for a decent-looking 8-pin extension for this line? I've found [this crappy one](http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-8-Inch-8-Pin-Extension-EPS8EXT/dp/B000M802RG) but I'd like something that doesn't look like it fell out of the 80's. If someone could point me towards a reasonable sleeved solution, I'd appreciate it. It would save me having to buy a new power supply for my new build next month.

Suggestions appreciated,ekswhyzed,15,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/13r9wh/my_cable_management_mess_suggestions_appreciated/,"So about 5-ish months ago I built my first pc. I was feeling on top of the world! ..until it came to the cables. Turns out my case, the [Cooler Master Elite 371](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811119241), has pretty much no options for cable management. What a bummer :( . So being the genius I am, I clumped them all together, and until now it's worked, kinda. My CPU (Phenom II X4 945) idle temp is about 41-44c, and realistic load (games etc.) is about 52-56c. Prime 95 is about 62c, pressing 64c. I have 2 fans; The stock case fan mounted in the rear for exhaust, and a $10 CM 120mm fan (Blue LED's!) in the front for intake. The CPU is on the stock cooler.

Anyways, I've been wanting to overclock both the CPU and graphics card, but the temps are just too great. I know I need an aftermarket cooler for the CPU, and I will get one, but I want to take care of my cables first, because I'm almost certain they're blocking airflow. So, any ideas, anyone? Don't be shy.

The mess: http://imgur.com/a/SBfrf

My specs if anyone's interested:
* Phenom II X4 945 95w * Asrock Extreme 4 AM3+ * 2x4gb Corsair Vengeance 1600mhz * 1tb Seagate HDD * Asus Gtx 560 1gb * CM Elite 371 * OCZ ModXtream 600w

*Side note: My version of the case came with a plastic window covering all of the side instead of the 2 fan spots on newegg. I dunno why, but I never questioned it.

**A little feedback**
I've had the same tiny budget case for years now and I've come to a point where the case is so filled up with cables ( no room for cable management ) that the case won't close properly.
I'll refrain from posting pictures as I am sure it would churn your stomach.
So I need a new case!

* My current case is very noisy, probably because the cables restrict the airflow, it's like having a vacuum cleaner in the room, all the time.
Which is what caused my interest towards the Fractal Design case, it supposed to somewhat lower the noise with the padding inside the case, I might be a little biased as I've somewhat forgotten how much noise a ""normal"" computer produces.

* My cable management is so bad I assume this subreddit would shun it more then the Chinese currently shun the Japanese.
But I can't help it, there simply isn't any room for it.

I know this subreddit adores the 600T and I suppose it's for good reason ( did some research but nothing to convincing so far ) but it's hard to get in my country, so i'm keeping my options open.

Any feedback would be appreciated!

I work at a big retail chain that has a huge nerd patrol that takes care of computers, and a lot of other IT services. I have built my computers since i was 13 and only have two pet peeves in this world. The first is unfolded towels and blankets, i don't understand why they must immediately be folded myself, they simply must. 

The final and most important, is cable management. Not only inside my computer but especially my home theater and PC desk and the surrounding areas. 

I am looking for a career in IT and these types of services. I have had the opportunity to talk at length with the supervisor there about cable management and they will send out a disgustingly wretched mangle of wires. They are a huge retail chain, and i was given an appropriately white washed answer that simply says that it isn't worth our time, and that the customer won't care. 

At what point is cable management about integrity of service? Am I to think that if we might spend 5-10 minutes  tying up disgusting wires to look professional that such time is a misuse of my time? I have been disturbed by this because of the level of care i take in computers i have worked on privately and within the store. 

What should i do to satisfy my compulsion when i begin to work with them?",,False,self,t5_2tdv7,False,,,True,t3_1ddwd9,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1ddwd9/working_in_computer_services_cbl_management/,

I would really love to take my first shot at cable management with this rig so she can have something nice to show off, but after the cost of the components it took a bit of convincing for her to put a couple extra fans for the push/pull radiator in her budget so CM will be coming out of my pocket if I do it.

About how much would it cost for cable extenders and necessary accessories to hook all that up and make it look absolutely clean while taking up as little space as possible (gonna be overclocking what I can within reason so any air restrictions saved are nice too).

She will eventually be adding more hard drives as she settles into it. She has plenty of externals, and her old computer as a backup, so I'm just going to start out with the SSD and get everything running perfect before getting the finished build back to her and adding in the new drives as she needs them. So it would be nice to know the cost of some extra HDD accessories as well.

Its done. My baby is built and Ive been in love ever since. Seeing that this is my very first build I opted take it a step further. I decided to get my own para cord and began a painful journey to (burn the hell out of my fingers) sleeve my own cables. Guys a few of the pin slots were difficult to remove the pins and I ended up ruining the stops in the slot that catch the metal prongs on the pin which hold the pin in place. I put a dab of crazy glue right where the sleeving ends just under the actual pin (being carful to not get any on the actual pin itself) to rectify this. Does anyone object to this method? I would rather not have to buy more cables to sleeve, Im just concerned and curious if the gluing method is ""safe"".
Many thanks in Advanced

I'm looking for a red/grey/black theme such as the far right in this pic: http://i.imgur.com/GYnwqjsh.jpg (work of /u/Jappetto I think)",,False,self,t5_2tdv7,False,,,True,t3_1kjlqs,http://www.reddit.com/r/CableManagement/comments/1kjlqs/custom_sleeving_help/,
