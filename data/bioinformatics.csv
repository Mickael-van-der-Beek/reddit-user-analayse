Often, newer work can be overlooked in the journals, especially when behind an IEEE pay wall. 

With that in mind I am additionally posting my work here. The software is open source under the MIT license and  available at [http://www.bioinformatics.uwaterloo.ca/feast/](http://www.bioinformatics.uwaterloo.ca/feast/). A preprint of the paper can be found on my web page, http://alexander.hudek.org. A summary of the work is below.

-----

*FEAST: sensitive local alignment with multiple rates of evolution.*

We present a pairwise local aligner, FEAST, which uses two new techniques: a sensitive extension algorithm for identifying
homologous subsequences, and a descriptive probabilistic alignment model. We also present a new procedure for training alignment
parameters and apply it to the human and mouse genomes, producing a better parameter set for these sequences. Our extension
algorithm identiﬁes homologous subsequences by considering all evolutionary histories. It has higher maximum sensitivity than Viterbi
extensions, and better balances speciﬁcity. We model alignments with several sub-models, each with unique statistical properties,
describing strongly similar and weakly similar regions of homologous DNA. Training parameters using two sub-models produces
superior alignments, even when we align with only the parameters from the weaker sub-model. Our extension algorithm combined
with our new parameter set achieves sensitivity 0.59 on synthetic tests. In contrast, LASTZ with default settings achieves sensitivity
0.35 with the same false positive rate. Using the weak sub-model as parameters for LASTZ increases its sensitivity to 0.59 with high
error. FEAST is available at http://monod.uwaterloo.ca/feast/.

I remember several thought this would be a good idea. Well, I went ahead and wrote it over the past months. It's free and open-source. It will read many different kinds of formats in the same simple syntax:

     import track
     with track.load('tracks/rp_genes.bed') as rp:
         data = rp.read('chr3')

You install it by typing:

Undergrad looking for advice.,GeneticsGuy,22,3,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/1d9ro0/bioinformatics_or_computational_biology_undergrad/,"So, background is I am studying Molecular and Cellular Biology and I have an intense fascination with the genetics world.  I have some wet lab experience now, but I noticed something.  Every time I asked a professor if they could use an extra hand in their lab or if they knew a colleague that could, they all asked me if I had any background at the command line, or any programming experience in PERL.  I didn't, which didn't stop me from getting some work in, but I see how that would have thrilled them if I did.

So, being proactive, I decided to learn how to program on my own.  It has not been easy, and it has been a challenge, but WOW, I feel I can actually at least read PERL code now and even build my own programs (PERL Cookbook has been an amazing cheat sheet book to learn).  I have to say, surprisingly, that coding has actually been quite rewarding for me.  It is like a sense of creating something of my own I guess.  Like a sense of accomplishment when I finally figure out how to do something.   I even started to dream about coding lol.

Anyway, here is my dilemma, and I haven't been able to get a clear cut answer.  My University does not have a Bioinformatics degree, or Computational Biology or anything. They have a couple Bioinformatics Grad lvl courses (one I was allowed to sign up for this fall, yay!), but a couple professors have told me that Bioinformatics and computational biology are the same thing.  However, another professor who is working on a comparison genomics program told me that they are not the same and he is a ""Computational Biologist"" not someone in Bioinformatics.

I like the programming side of it and I want to go further with it, but do I pursue more bioinformatics knowledge, or should I look for more in the comp-sci world?

Also, what is better...  A computer scientist first who gets trained in biology, or a Biology person who learns the computer science?

I have considered doing a double degree, but the extra time commitment is a lot and I don't want to waste my time either since Comp Sci guys seem to do a LOT of stuff completely unrelated to what I want to do.

Anyway, any advice would be great.  I've been a long-time lurker of this forum and all of it is very interesting.

Is it worth taking a pay cut? ,loggedToUpdateThis,20,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/hnge5/should_i_go_into_this_field_is_it_worth_taking_a/,"Hi /r/bioinformatics, I think will post this in programming as well.
I'll try to keep it short, but am happy to answer any questions.

I'm a 30 yr old developer (not sure if age is relevant for this), and I'm fairly proficient in Perl using commercial stuff like Moose, Catalyst, TT, ...
The fact that I got a MSc in Computer Science allowed me to get a job offer at one of the main institutions around for genome, bioinformatics,...

Now, they offer a salary which is around 8% less what I'm currently making in my ""normal"" development job, and after finding out of the job offer, my current employers are offering a 23% pay rise, which makes the difference in salaries a bit significant.

I'm not sure what my actual job would be other than creating scripts that would serve as pipeline for processing the raw data from sequencing.

I have a natural inclination for biology  and the purpose of this role seems great, but in the coding side, 
will I feel frustrated dealing with code where my experience will not be relevant at all? 
how nice or ugly is the code of some other people who are chemists/biologists and learned to program as a secondary need?

* What was your major in undergrad?
* If you went to grad school, what did you study there? Also, is grad school a neccessity?
* How is the day-to-day? Is most of your time spent in front of a computer, or is there a lot of interaction/group work?
* Is it a rewarding career, or more of a ""come in, do what you're paid for, go home"" type of job. I guess this depends on the individual, but I'd like to hear your insights.
* How did you get involved in the field, particularly in the lab where you work?

For the last two months, my two Co-founders and I have been building a startup called [Banyan](http://getbanyan.co). Were aiming to be the github for science. 

Today, we opened our [registration to a public beta](http://getbanyan.co/users/sign_up). Its free to get started, but were leaving the option open for a pay-what-you-want model if you would like to help us bootstrap! 

As of right now, we have a pretty basic feature set. We have alot of things on our product roadmap, and were actively shipping improvements daily. 

Heres what our product does right now:

* Private research repositories
* Task management, milestones, project management tools like walls &amp; wikis
* Unlimited team members &amp; collaborators 
* Unlimited private repo space!

Our product roadmap includes:

* Launching a cross platform desktop client
* Adding public profiles
* Launching peer review tools
* The ability to convert any document into a git repo and retain the formatting
* Forking git to be able to track changes on huge files

What were looking for from our early users is to shape our product and feature set so we can build a tool that you will love and use. In order to do that, Im personally making myself available via [email](http://mailto:toni@getbanyan.co) and skype (my id is Tgemayel). If anyone is old school, and prefers using a good ole phone, you can DM me and I would be happy to give you my cell number. You can also use our live chat on the site to instant message me.

We are really passionate about what were building, but we understand we cant do it alone. We need your help reddit! 

I will be hanging out on this thread all day, and Im happy to answer any questions you guys have!

We then shifted to doing dozens and then hundreds of these at a time with comparative approaches.  Now metagenomic annotation and comparison efforts occupy a lot of my time as part of the [HMP](http://hmpdacc.org).

I know there are a lot of good tools and services out there.  I use a great deal of them and have helped develop some.  (MG-)RAST, IGV, Maker, Galaxy, Manatee, Apollo, Ergatis, Artemis, Sybil ... the list is long and with overlapping functionality.  

Recognizing that some people want fully automated annotation while others want to do careful gene-by-gene curation, I started playing around with a new (open-source) project integrating some of these while adding new functionality.  I want to ask the community what you like and don't like about the existing tools, and what is missing altogether?  What tools ultimately give you want you want but you can envision a much user-friendly way of doing it?

I'm leaving this pretty open intentionally and welcome your comments.  I'll be treating this in part as a sort of requirements-gathering exercise but I'd also just love feedback from the community outside of what I'm used to dealing with.

I've come across a few, ""How do I get into bioinformatics"" type posts. What I wanted to know was what the field is like when you're actually in bioinformatics.

So, say you get a Ph. D. in bioinformatics. What's next? How much of the field is currently academic vs. industrial (not sure if proper term, but working for pharmaceutical companies, Monsanto, that sort of thing in latter category).

I don't want to give out too much info about myself, but I'm in 2nd year of undergrad, doing Biology and Computer Science. I'm doing some work with a professor in evolutionary biology in terms of research experience.

I was also wondering if there was any tips from people later on in their career paths about what I should aim to accomplish during my undergrad. My general impression is that getting a Ph. D. is valuable in this field. Does anything beyond standard trio of good marks, good extra-curriculars, good research experience apply to getting into good programs later on?

More or less, I'm looking at the gaping chasm of my future in front of me, and I'd like to get as much info about what I'm getting myself into now rather than later.

So, I guess even general impressions of your current life, the path that brought you here, what excites you/worries you about your future as a bioinformatician would also be relevant.

I would be truly appreciative of any information you could provide. I think it's pretty awesome reddit even has a r/bioinformatics subreddit.

TL;DR -- Verbose undergrad desires info on what it's like to be a bioinformatician BEFORE he becomes a bioinformatician. Would like all of your secrets.

EDIT: For those that have not become bored of my (written) voice. So far, my programming experience extends from high school. I know Python, Java, and am working on C. One of my courses has also familiarized me with R. Motivations for getting into Bioinformatics is I always wanted to be a biologist growing up, discovered programming and how FUN it was in high school, realized I didn't want to do much else in my life, but also didn't want to abandon biology, which had more or less occupied my imagination from years 5-now.

EDIT2: Going to sleep now. It's been an absolute pleasure interacting with you guys (and possibly girls), I really hope some more people can contribute their thoughts, this subreddit is incredibly valuable for someone that is just beginning to get into this field.

EDIT3: Just wanted to thank everyone that participated in the post. It was informative, encouraging, and interesting to me. I'm also glad to have found a community of individuals willing to help those who are just starting along a new path. If anyone stumbles across this post in the future, I'll keep on checking it for a while, just wanted to get my thanks out now.",,False,,t5_2qh0x,True,,,True,t3_mx461,http://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/mx461/whats_it_like_going_into_bioinformatics_now/,

I’ve been lucky enough to score two jobs upon graduating from my MSc in bioinformatics. I’m working both concurrently on a part-time basis as a research assistant. One of the positions is about 50/50 bench work and bioinformatics, I’ll call this job A while the other is 100% pure bioinformatics, job B. Job A is in a wet lab where I’m the only bioinformatician, while in job B I’m part of a purely a bioinformatic team. I need to decide which one I want to work on full time as it’s not going to be possible for me to continue both!

I would certainly learn more biology with job A and pick up some wet lab techniques, which would be beneficial as I have a lot more experienced in the computational side of things, coming from a compsci background. I do worry about becoming a ‘jack of all trades, master of none’. I don’t overly enjoy the wet lab work, but I do really like the variety and being able to break my day up from coding/staring at a screen. Job B on the other hand involves work on some very exciting and top tier purely computational work. The project I’m working on for job B has more interesting biological questions, but I enjoy both projects.

Generally, I’m learning far more transferable skills from job B as I’m not sure if I want to go down the PhD route, which job A would lead to. I like research, but permanent research positions are very hard to get so I need a fall-back. Job A has some nice perks, better pay and a nicer/more social environment which can be pretty important for day-to-day sanity and balance. 

I’m not sure if I should attempt to become proficient at both the wet and dry lab and go with job A or just focus on the dry lab, have less variety but better prospects and computational training.

The first step of the project was to basically clean up the perl scripts they had written for this purpose. This was easy, just simple refactoring, and I learned a lot about NGS.  However the second part is to build a web interface and I am now struggling with the scripts they wrote.

In theirs scripts they used newbler to convert the sff files to FASTA (one file of reads for each individual). They then aligned the reads to a reference file using BLAST and basically constructed their own alignment file using straight perl. I need to start doing some analysis on this file (coverage, mutation identification, etc.) and I'm starting to feel they went about it really wrong. I was hoping someone could clarify things a bit for me.

Now, I've been reading a lot about this, and it seems to me we should be using a different tool for the alignment instead of straight BLAST. Really the output should be in SAM format correct? I've read a few sites such as [this](http://www.biostars.org/post/show/2001/454-sequences-how-to-get-a-bam-coverage/#2002) discussing various options. I guess my main question is, should I be diverging from their original approach and using some other tools or do you think it's ok to get the coverage, etc. manually? They don't seem to have taken into account quality scores or anything like that or perhaps I am just naive about the requirements.

Note: They are looking for something akin to [this](http://sierra2.stanford.edu/sierra/servlet/JSierra?action=sequenceInput) but for an overall population.

I have never done any work on the subject of comparative genomics, so I'm not even sure what some common approaches are.

I think the phylogenetic relations are mostly resolved (at least for the species I'll be working with), so I probably won't have to spend too much time on tree reconstruction.

My advisor's ideas include looking at differences in codon bias and differences between parasitic and non-parasitic species (as well as social and non-social species).

I do realize this is a very broad and unspecific question, but I'm just looking for some inspiration at the moment. Any good review articles on this topic would be very welcome!

On a more specific note: How is it possible to compare genes on a genome wide level between species without too much bias, given that gene prediction algorithms assume a certain codon bias, but this codon bias is different for each species?

**TL;DR:** Looking for undergraduate level coding projects a computer scientist can undertake to learn some biology and demonstrate interest in the field.

Long time lurker of this subreddit, I did a search of similar posts and couldn't really find anything, so forgive me if this has been asked before.

I'm a senior undergraduate computer science student. I have a good undergraduate level background in coding, algorithms, data-mining, databases etc, and limited bio background (something I'm working on)

I've been interested in bioinformatics for a very long time, soon I will be applying for programming co-ops at several bio labs and I would like to do some self coding projects as both a learning experience and a way to demonstrate my interest.

The projects don't need to be useful to anyone else, its really just as a learning experience for myself. When I am ready I might try jump into a project like biopython.

Anyway, I figured you fine folk may have a few ideas to point me in the right direction.

**Edit:** I should mention I've dabbled bit in bayesian statistics and data mining, and I have a good amount of graphics work behind me. Next semester I'll be doing a data mining course and I know there is a course project that will involve us choosing a data set from somewhere and performing various tricks on it.

So far, I've mainly been drawn to bioinformatics and medical informatics. They seem to be pretty closely related, with both representing a nice ""coming together"" of the CS and medicine disciplines.

1. As someone with NO med/bio background whatsoever, what would be the best way to transition into that area? Would it be something I could break into with my current IT/CS experience? Or would it be worthwhile to pursue a master's, say in bioinformatics or medical informatics? Attending a few bio-/healthcare-related community college courses?

2. Are there any other good resources like [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info) for learning some of the basics? From a technical perspective, it looks like I wouldn't have much trouble coming up with the solutions, though I would be going in blind without understanding the science behind it.

3. What types of jobs are available at the various levels of experience and education? More importantly, what types of things do you ""do""?

4. How is the current job market and future outlook over the next decade or so for BI/MI? I would guess there will be some growth, especially with genome sequencing becoming more and more accessible.

The test data is for [GSE8607 out of the GEO database](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE8607) it has been normalized to be properly accepted by the GALGO and PAMR libraries but other than that it's unaltered.


================================ GALGO ================================


All results here are for 3000 chromosomes (variables) with 5 genes each and the fitness goal is of .9


========================= 


This first image: http://i.imgur.com/hMsFQ.png depicts the summary of the characteristics of the chromosome population in the course of one evolutionary event. 


The first graph (Gene Frequency) hast a ""Gene Index"" in X (I'm unsure of what that means) and the Frequency in which the genes appeared in Y. It depicts the 7 most frequent genes with their respective names on top of the bar. 


The second graph (Gene Rank Stability) has Rank + Frequency in Y (I'm unsure what ""Rank"" is) and Genes on X. From there we can see the most stable genes which are the darkest ones (left side).


The third graph (Last Generation) is a complete mystery to me to be honest.


========================= 


The second image: http://i.imgur.com/M68CB.png depicts the population summary for that number of test (in this case the test 3000).


The first graph (Population) is a mystery except that I've managed to learn that the tiny blue x you can see close to where the overlapping of results occur means that that's a fit candidate.


The second graph (Fitness History) gives us 2 dotted lines, the first being a red one (g) which is the fitness goal (never reached in this example) and the second one a black one (b) which is the best result yet. We can see the best result is around ~.86 and that's not far from the goal fitness. Also, this was reached in the ~11th generation which means it was achieved relatively quick, however since it's not the desired fitness we would require to either add more variables OR reduce the fitness goal (which isn't something desirable).


The third graph (Max-Chromosomes) has in X Genes and in Y the Generation but other than that I'm at a loss.


========================= 


The third image http://i.imgur.com/jvTdO.png depicts the overall fitness of the test the blue line is the mean of all the chromosomes and we can see that on the 12th generation the 90% fitness level was achieved while this seems contradictive with the past graph that's because the past graph was focusing on the latest test and this is the average.


========================= 


The fourth image http://i.imgur.com/W0qgq.png shows the confusion matrix in which we can see that the sensitivity (probability of obtaining a negative result when it's not present) is of .72 for Etapa 1 (E1) and .71 for Etapa 4 (E4) the specificity (probability of obtaining a positive when it's not there) os the opposite for both. Now in HERE we can see that the fitness level of .9 is not achieved and this may be a result of the fact that the fitness takes a training set and then cross-validates while this test uses all of the available data possibly skewing the results. Other than that, we can see that even though there is a clear separation between the results there is still some mixup (.28 and .29 respectively)


=========================


The next image http://i.imgur.com/fJ8x3.png shows the same confusion matrix but filtered with the solutions only which is why it dropped 4 models. Since there's really not much variation we can safely assume these aren't relevant for the results.


=========================


The next one http://i.imgur.com/j6Q2B.png shows again the confusion matrix filtered by solutions but picking only the best chromosome which gives us a much better separation between E4 and E1.


=========================


This one http://i.imgur.com/K0t3i.png is a heatmap built with the best chromosomes of the set, the only thing I'm certain about here is that since there is color uniformity we can say it's a good differentiation test.


=========================


In here: http://i.imgur.com/YGICE.png we can see a heatmap built with the list of genes from the forward selection model (the image is further in this thread) and we can still see the uniformity of color specially differentiating a red color from the top-left to the down-right corners.


=========================


These: http://i.imgur.com/kINpG.png are the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) of the best 2 genes according to the forward selection model as far as I can tell, there's no clear separation between the components but I can't say anything else.


=========================


In this image: http://i.imgur.com/gdKvJ.png we see the forward selection model, the best 2 genes being 2 and 9 out of the 10 options so we get 2 recommended biomarkers of 15 and 24 genes respectively.


================================ PAMR ================================


After doing the training and cross-validating of the data with the PAMR library this is the plot of the cross-validation http://i.imgur.com/PlBZd.png in here we can see in the first graph that the misclassification error is always close to .4 but other than that I'm not sure what information I can gather from that graph.


The second graph though shows the difference in the misclassification error between E1 and E4 and it increases dramatically for E4 when we start using less and less genes while it decreases for E1. Since this technique uses the [Shrunken Centroid Classification](http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/PAM/Rdist/howwork.html) method I think it's best to get an impartial threshold value (I might be wrong) and thus 1.7 was selected.


Because 1.7 was selected the following graph: http://i.imgur.com/DKeAJ.png (which happens to be the confusion matrix) shows that E4 has more variation when using the shrunken centroid but I don't know what else I can take from there.


Following these are 2 results the first is the Error rate http://i.imgur.com/vvtND.png and then the Cross-validation of the gene probabilities: http://i.imgur.com/7otgM.png I can't figure these graphs out.


So, there's that and that's all I know so far. Could anyone provide me any more guidance? I will be answering any questions that you guys may have (to better understand what I'm doing) during the day.

He is interested in bioinformatics and needs to find a project for next year. 

I'll be graduating with a molecular biology degree this year (but will stay another year to learn more statistics and computer science) and one of my professors has two sequenced genomes of Rhagoletis species (a type of fly), but needs them assembled and annotated.  My guess is that their genomes are about 200 million base pairs long and have 17,000ish genes.  My question is how feasible would this project be for the two of us to complete together?  Currently, I only know a little CS and he knows the basics of molecular biology.  Before we talk to the professor about doing this we would like to know how difficult is it to assemble and annotate a genome.
  
For example, can assembling and annotating a genome be mostly done with the already made software packages out there?  Is it a lot of manual curation that requires a specific skill set to do?  Could we develop that skill set in about 3 months of non-stop work (over the summer)?  Is this mostly done by tweaking open-source annotators to fit with the unique gene regulating and gene structure characteristics of your organism?

We both are taking a bioinformatics class this quarter--the major part of which will be doing a project which could involve these genomes, we will be here over the summer, and here all next year.  We're willing to devote ourselves for a long time and put in a lot of work to do this.  How feasible do you think us being able to produce a quality product is?

Thanks!

Edit:  The sequences are actually two varieties of the same species of Rahgoletis.  I'm not sure the type of reads, but there is a very large collection of ESTs for both of the varieties.

Edit 2:  There is no reference genome.  Some syntanty research has been done.  And It appears that RNAseq will need to be done to annotate this genome.

Trouble is, I can't think of anything good.  

The tool is a non-linear gene neighborhood visualization.  Basically there are three views, one is linear, one is a set of nested rotating circles, and the other is for navigation.  The circle view is the meat of this, as it provides a local view of gene neighborhoods between multiple organisms regardless of differences in relative location and it allows any gene to be the point of reference.

It's designed to be very fast. It sits on an olap database with a node JS middleware and is visualized with HTML5 Canvas and d3.js/jquery/ajax.  

I would like a good name, acronyms are fine, seeing how they're everywhere.  I thought about AXEL as an acronym because of the 'wheel view' but don't know what the letters could stand for.  Also I considered geneRoulette, but I think people would just expect penises everywhere if I called it that.

My first love remains biology, however, and I'm thinking that a MS degree in bioinformatics would allow me to marry my career experience thus far to my preferred field, Biology. I don't think I'm interested in a PhD. This is all complicated by the fact that I have three small children, and a husband whose business can't relocate from our small resort town in Colorado.  

My questions are:  
* Are the MS degrees available in Bioinformatics that offer online learning?  
* Are there good Bioinformatics MS programs in Colorado?  
* Are there career options in bioinformatics without an advanced degree?  
* If so, what should I be learning to make this possible?  
* Any advice for someone in my situation who has been out of school for a long time?

Added info:     

- Alignments are done allowing the algorithm to trim the reads by up to 15 base pairs to maximize the read quality.
 
- Validation: done by Sanger sequencing. Still haven't been able to validate any SNPs.  Some of these were of quality over 200 with a DP4 of 0 reference and over 100 alternative allele (the organism is haploid, so all SNPs should be homozygous).

1) We will probably buy one HiSeq 1000 machine.
2) We will probably buy one MySeq machine.
3) We may buy non-illumina technology, i.e., Ion Torrent, Roche 454.

1) How often these sequencing machines will be used.
2) How many users at the institute will be sequencing.

What courses should I be taking? I've already taken an introductory bio and CS course, and a Data Structures class, and I'm slated to take more CS courses and a Genetics course next year. 

Any programming languages that I should start learning? Any advice on getting a Masters or PhD in Bioinformatics/Computational Biology?

I'm still waiting on news from potential internships for this summer. If they fall through, how should I use my time instead?

This is especially true since I've started using Test-Driven Development for developing analysis programs. Testing and debugging bash pipelines is ridiculous. It gets the job done, but just barely.

In my mind, the ideal pipeline would be flexible, remember states, track errors and allow you to change a parameter of a module without having to rerun the whole damn thing from scratch. The closest thing I've seen to what I want is a job submission perl module that was packaged with [deFuse](http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1001138). It included a ""cmdrunner.pm"", which is a nice little package for submitting jobs in parallel to a variety of different job managers (LFS, SGE, nonparallel serial jobs). It also tracked errors and state so you could have a job crash, fix what was wrong, restart the job and not have to do the whole damn thing over.

I've also tried [parasol](http://genecats.cse.ucsc.edu/eng/parasol.htm), a UCSC homebrew package that replaces SGE.

Unfortunately, neither of these packages really do what I want.

I've considered using a local installation of [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/), but the thought of writing plug-ins for each program turned me off. Maybe I was wrong and it's not really hard to do? It does seem to be easy to make new pipelines especially for people with limited scripting experience.

I'm about to go to university in a few months and really interested in biology, mathematics and IT, also somewhat interested in chemistry. Thus it's no miracle that studying bioinformatics sounds tempting. Also, I'm currently doing an internship in a lab and find it really interesting.

I'm still not sure whether it's the right thing for me though. 

First of all, there's this fear that the whole bioinformatics thing is just going to be a huge bubble of false expectations of the scientific world. I don't want to study this a few years of my life just to be unemployed because nobody needs me anymore. This fear is especially fuelled by the infamous [""farewell to bioinformatics""](http://madhadron.com/a-farewell-to-bioinformatics) by Fred Ross. I've already talked to my boss at the lab about this, and he told me that he thinks it's going to play a very important role in the future, and that the criticism would be justified if we were talking about it's role a few years ago, but that things are changing quickly in favor of this field of science. But yeah.. what do you guys think about it?

To play the devils advocate, if bioinformatics should really be doomed one day, would I be able to switch into some other job, especially something IT related? Probably with some re-training, but would I have an advantage with my previously attained bioinformatics knowledge (as in not having to re-learn everything)?

Also, I have doubts about multitude of subjects you're supposed to familiarize yourself with. I would go for a B.Sc. in bioinformatics at a reputable university in my country. Do you think it's a good idea to dive into the different subjects required for bioinformatics simultaneously or should I first pursue a general CS B.Sc. and then specialize myself?

Also, how do I find out which universities are 'good' for this subject? Are there any (trustworthy!) rankings out there?

Gee, this is such a hard decision. I'd love to work in some bio-ish research with the help of computers, as I'm not really fond of the idea of working on some corporate project I have virtually no interest in. But my only alternatives are studying either biology, CS or mathematics, none of which sound quite as good as bioinformatics.

So I got the biology down, for the most part- could use some brushing up.  And I can program in python, nothing fancy though.  About me personally, I have always been fascinated by biology, neuroscience, and psychology.  

This has been problematic actually because while I was in school I would change my mind about what I want to do every few months.  Oh, I'll go to grad school and study neuroscience.  Bioinformatics.  Med school.  I actually applied to a few neuroscience programs and took the GRE's, but decided that I wasn't ready to make a decision.  Anyway now that I am done with school, I just feel like I've been stagnant.  I work full time basically, but I don't have a job which teaches me anything.  I don't create anything.  

Anyway I played with a hypothetical for a while, to help me decide what I want to do with my life and finally do it- basically, if I won the lottery and became set for life, would I still pursue this?  Well to be honest, no, I wouldn't become a doctor.  But bioinformatics is a field that I could see myself doing and being passionate about.  

Now I know that ""bioinformatics"" means a lot of things.  I am personally interested in the systems biology aspect- specifically modelling neural networks and cellular pathways.  I am less interested in things like protein folding and molecular modelling, but I see how being able to work with that kind of information can be very useful and important to doing the things I want to do.  

So here are my questions.  I took a very easy stats course a few years ago.  And this is kind of embarrassing, but I've written some kick-ass research papers- but when I look at the results section of a paper I am using I am basically just like ""oh ok significance"".  So I know I need strong statistics skills.  But should I just crack open a stats book, or should I learn other math as well?  Should I learn calculus first?  Should I learn Calc I-III?

Also, presuming you are a student/professor- what do I need to accomplish to make myself a competitive applicant?  I mean obviously I know I have to familiarize myself with research, and have my own ideas.  Is there anything else?  (I have a 3.5 GPA from uni, not great but not bad either).

Now normally (from what I understand) hmmsearch requires a protein query. Is there a tool that perhaps runs tblastx against an hmm, and  returns the best hit? I'm able to script in perl, so I think I could figure this out, but I was hoping there might be an existing tool.

Basically I have three questions:

1. How many lipids are practical to look at?  Papers I've read have a big range, but so I'm unclear why a researcher would limit themselves?  Is it the practicality of tissue/sample size, relevance to a paper, speed of the instrument or the ability of the machine/analysis to detect more species? 

2.  What are the options of instruments?  My understanding is they come in two flavors - HPLC-MS and shotgun style.  The former passes the sample through a column first to achieve some separation to make a better prediction about the lipid's size whereas the latter does not do this because ultimately we can predict the size from the machine's output anyway?

3. How exactly does one turn a bunch of mass/charge ratios into lipid profiles?  I assume there is some large data base of confirmed lipid spectra that we cross-reference, but how?  If this software is open source and readily available, how does anyone have some sample data I can play around with?

I am taking an intro to bioinformatics and noticed the redundancies in the codons that map to an amino acid.  For instance, UCU, UCA, UCG, and UCC all map to Serine.  The pattern of the first two base pairs being the same for an amino acid seems to hold for many amino acids.  Is there some sort of biological reason why there are these redundancies?  Is the transcription or translation process more likely to ""corrupt"" the last base pair?

I keep thinking about hamming distances (maybe that is not the best approach to this, since this is, after all, a biological process) and how the way these are mapped would not be the most practical for providing the best error correction.  Though this is assuming that each of the base pairs are equally likely to be corrupted, which my intuition is telling me is wrong.  The fact that DNA has evolved to have some sort of error correction is quite amazing in my eyes.

So, ill try to keep this short. I know people have sort of asked the question before, but wanted to give you an idea of who I am.

I am a pharmacology grad who has recently completed an MBA in Healthcare Management and currently working at a small biotech. I have always had an interest on the ever growing role computing, IT, and IS will continue to play a role in biology (specifically my industry, molecular diagnostics). I have poked around a couple of languages (i.e. Python, Java, etc.) and find programming interesting, although I don't know if I could ever be the type and sit and program for a living. I am a sort of extrovert and I think if I had a job soley coding I would be miserable.
Recently, I found a very high quality Bioinformatics Masters program that seems interesting, but I have a couple of questions for you guys in the industry...

1) Do you have a CS or Biology background?
2) Is your role primarily coding, or is it cross functional?
3) Is there a need for people to study bioinformatics? I hear the industry is growing, but some sources that are cited would be great.
4) Is there a need for people that have an MBA/MS in Bioinformatics?

I should also clarify that I have absolutely no desire to go into academics (i.e. PhD), I really enjoy the private sector and am wondering if there is a market demand for people with a cross-disciplinary background like myself.

So I'm currently in a position where I'm still incredibly undecided about what to do next. I am currently finishing off an honours degree having majored in biochemistry and genetics at university. I had one unit on bioinformatics during my degree but didn't particularly consider it as a actual career rather than a tool. I've had to do some bioinformatics during my honours project and have always had an interest in computers. The difficulty is that I have been strongly considering doing a PhD next year. I've also been thinking a lot about actually getting a career once I finally finish and have realized that bioinformatics is probably a much more viable career move. I have experience with computers, but no programming experience whatsoever. I assume it is therefore not possible to do a PhD in bioinformatics, so my question is: would I still be able to take courses in programming and get a job in bioinformatics even if I do a PhD in genetics/biochem? Or would I be better off studying programming and then doing a PhD in bioinformatics?

Sorry for the wordiness. I tend to ramble when I have a lot on my mind. Thanks for any help!

Edit: Wow. I didn't expect to get so many great responses so quickly! Thanks so much!
From reading everything it seems the consensus is that good programming skills are essential for pursuing any type of bioinformatics path, but the degree doesn't necessarily have to be solely in bioinformatics. A good point was raised that if I have no experience in programming then I won't have any idea whether I would enjoy it. I don't think I really considered it. I've always thought that it'd be something i'd enjoy and be quite good at. I've always been great at typing as well which I imagine would come in useful when coding. The links that were provided are certainly going to give me a good starting point to learn the basics and make a decision from there. At this stage, I think I will remain in my current lab. The lab does a lot of sequencing and recently got an Ion Torrent genome machine. I might see if I can do some work involving that later in my PhD and hopefully involve some bioinformatics experience I may have generated. I do have decent bioinformatics experience, but not much beyond the basics. I've had to do promoter analysis this year, meaning I've had to use both sequence searching and matrix-based algorithms for the determination of putative transcription factor binding sites. I've also done stuff before with protein domain databases and protein conformation. I've found it all to be more satisfying than all my wet lab work. I'll also look at possibly doing some work experience with the bioinformatics professor at the uni to at least improve my skills before/during my PhD.

I've read the paper, studied the concepts, and compiled the program. However I've been running into an odd problem.

I've been able to index sequences that are very long (using the bwtformatdb program) . I've tried it on a 50 million character sequence and the indexing went well. However, when I try to index shorter sequences (tens of thousands of characters, hundreds of thousands) I get these weird error messages. (I'm using the default .ini file, by the way.)

When trying to index a length 20k sequence, I get this:

**EDIT**: More info, in case it's useful. I have 2GB of RAM, (and 2GB of swap memory if I'm not mistaken). I still have lots of free disk space available (15GB).

I'm a Canadian student living in Ottawa (hopefully someone here is from Ottawa). I have a bachelor's in Biology and Computer Science and I am planning on applying to a graduate program.

I just wanted to ask you guys if there is a demand for bioinformatitians.

However, I have no idea what the demand is for the field of bioinformatics specifically here in Canada and even Ottawa. Would I most likely need a Phd to get a job in this field?

My other concern is salary. I know that it's not all about the money but if I can make more working as a software engineer for example I would rather go that route. I'm sorry if this seems rude but what are the average salaries for a bioinformatitians?

If its not too much to ask, perhaps you can point out some things that I'm missing or pointers for my choice.

I know what I have - my mutant has a 250kb hole in it's genome (yes it's large, and similar things have been published before in this organism). AND I know where. I have successfully done this one time before but I didn't write down notes on how I managed to get the visualisation and now I'm putting it all down to paper i can't repeat the result.

I'm trying to use trackster to show coverage over the genome, which is something the trial version of geneious which I used to find the hole originally can't do. 

However every time I try to view the coverage of my mapped paired reads against the host genome, it processes for about an hour and comes up with an error message.

I'm currently an undergraduate in my junior year, and I'm currently working on a research project involving genomics and machine learning. I'm interested in medically-oriented research. I know that this is about the time that I need to make some decisions as to whether or not I want to do a MD/PhD or just a PhD. I feel like I could be happy doing either, I'm more concerned with how I should prepare to allow myself the flexibility. My current GPA is ~3.3, but I should be able to bring it up during the next year. I'm a mathematics and chemistry double major. 

My question is:

If I don't get accepted into MSTP, can I still be accepted into a PhD program? I realize that my grades aren't amazing, but I intend to write a senior thesis and (if ACT/SAT scores are any indication) I believe that I'll score well on GRE/MCAT. All of the MSTP programs I've looked at say that you'll also be considered for medical school, but I (perhaps strangely) would rather be considered for secondary admission to regular graduate school. As I said above, my primary interest is research, but with a MD I could be more involved in seeing that research turn into clinical results.

My questions:

1. Should I even be considering MSTP? I know they're very competitive.
2. Do I still take the GRE?
3. Is it a bad idea to be applying for MSTP and graduate school? I'd much rather be in a PhD program than MD (unless it's together)?

I'm trying to align a bunch of degenerate DNA sequences, but I don't know if the forward or reverse complement will fit better or not.  For small sets, I can visually inspect to find the best orientation, and then run it through [MUSCLE](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/) for example.  But for longer or more degenerate sequences it can be hard to eyeball.

Thoughts?  Is there a multiple alignment method that tests reverse complements too? 

Here is an example of what I'm taking about.  The sequences are IUPAC encoded for degeneracy.

- Log

Background context for de novo genome assembly: I know the complexity scheme is O(n log n + n min{2Δ, n}), where n is the number of (k, d, Δ)-mers. It's relatively fast using paired end data as a heuristic, but as data becomes cheaper/simpler to resolve, there will be diminishing marginal returns as the bottleneck will become computing.       
    
I haven't worked with sequence alignment too much, but I thought I'd open the discussion to that as well.

So I've an interview on Monday morning with the P.I. of a clinical bioinformatics lab in a nearby university, and I really want to make it work. I graduated last year with a biochem undergrad degree, and while I do have some experience in bioinformatics (via both taught and research routes), as well as a working knowledge of and thorough interest in computers, I know very little about programming. I am willing to learn, of course.

I've examined much of the material on the lab's website, in terms of both the lab's overall goals and the research interests of individual personnel, and I'll been invited to meet these other researchers over lunch following the interview. I'm wondering is there any practical advice that /r/bioinformatics could offer? Are there any particular topics I should mention, or any that I should avoid? I'm extremely excited at the prospect of obtaining this position, and I'd also appreciate advice on how I should organize myself in the first couple of days (provided I actually get the job!), first impressions being what they are and all that.

I'm currently implementing an algorithm for calculating the likelihood of a
given phylogenetic tree. I'm reading chapter 16 in Joseph Felsenstein's
*Inferring Phylogenies* which explains this rather nicely, but I am stumped by
one thing and would like to hear if you can help me.

Given the following tree, *T*,

             x|
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
         t6/      \t8
          /        \
        y/         /\t7
        /\      t3/  \
     t1/  \t2    / t4/\t5
      /    \    /   /  \
     A      C  C   C    G

and an assumption that evolution in different lineages is independent, we get the following:

P(*A,C,C,C,G,x,y,z,w*|*T*) = P(x)×P(y|x,t6)×P(A|y,t1)×…×P(G|w,t5),

i.e. each probability is only dependent on what's above it and the branch
length. Ok, so far, so good. But then he writes:

&gt; **The probability of *x* may be taken to be the probability that, at a random
&gt; point on an evolving lineage, we would see base *x* (where *x = A, C, G,* or
&gt; *T*).** If we are allowed to assume that evolution has been proceeding for a
&gt; very long time according to the particular model of base substitution that we
&gt; are using, it is reasonable to take *P(x)* to be the equilibrium probability
&gt; of base *x* under that model. The other probabilities are derived from the
&gt; model of base substitution.

What I really don't understand is the text I highlighted in bold. (The rest was
included for context.) Why does he suddenly talk about “a random point on an
evolving lineage” when the text is talking about the tree shown above? Am I
simply reading to much into his formulation or have I missed anything?

TL;DR: Why does Felsenstein talk about *x* at a “random point”?

I will be somewhat spearheading a new PhD track in my program (toxicology).  

The department wants to try a computational approach, but my impression is that much of the current faculty don't have much experience with programming.

Personally my background is all math/physics/programming/machine learning.  I got into the program mainly because I have been doing programming for one of the labs there and had a strong academic/testing application.  

After talking to the Dean he has outlined the core curriculum that I am expected to take.  They want me to take molecular biology, toxicology, and biochemistry.  I have no problem with this, I wouldn't be doing toxicology if I wasn't interested in the biological side of things.  However, he isn't sure what computer science courses I should take, and I want to be certain that my programming and machine learning skills improve significantly while I'm in the program.

Do any of the people here have suggestions as to what kinds of courses I should be taking?   Eventually I would like to work in applying machine learning to systems biology, pharmaceuticals, or some other field where I might be able to make a difference.  

I would also like advise on anything related to this kind of problem.  Is there anything in particular I should be careful of when selecting labs?  How can I guarantee that I am as marketable as possible from a bioinformatics perspective when coming out of this phd?

When I graduate I think I would want to either get a job at a small startup (machine learning + bio related) where I can have significant impact on the company, or at a company where I would get more experience to prepare me to do this.

I am completing my MSc. Bioinformatics in northern Europe, and should be done in early June.  With the help of ""Professor A"" who is interested in having me as a PhD student, but who didn't have the spare funds to hire me outright, I submitted a grant application to a national foundation.  The grant application was for the first full year of PhD work.  I got news recently that they had awarded me a grant for the first 6 months of work.  Professor A has since earned some group grant money and could continue paying me after the grant money period.  Woohoo!

However, I am not certain I want to pursue the PhD at this institution, and would like to continue looking for good options.  

My current line of thinking is that it would be good to take the 6 month national grant, complete two other publications that have been in the works, and complete one or two more related to the worked specified in the grant, while searching for PhD positions using a CV that now includes more publications and the fact that I have won a grant.

I have never been in this situation before or very long in academics at this level.  Would this be burning any bridges with Professor A?  Is it common that people actively look for better PhD positions while having an offer on the table at the university where they are currently pursuing the MSc?

My question comes from a thought raised by someone else on this subreddit as well as a friend. Living in the most isolated capital city in the world (Perth, Western Australia) there are no bioinformatics courses in universities. So here's where it gets a bit complicated. I like tables (hehe) (edit: apparently tables hate me so list for now), so my two main course choices are:


**Bachelor of Science**

* University of Western Australia; no Bioinformatics course; two majors required (thus Computer Science and Genetics)
* Just down the road from where I live; still see friends etc.; no moving/living costs; UWA (from memory) is very good with genetics research
* Not specific; UWA's Computer Science is apparently 'questionable'; WA certainly not a bioinformatics 'hotspot' (apparently Melbourne is)


**Bioinformatics**

* University of New South Wales (other side of Australia)
* Specific course; UNSW has the National Computer Science School; closer to potential employers
* Have to move, therefore living costs, no seeing friends/family; moneys!


I'm sure that was suitably vague. The issue others have raised is whether or not doing the Bioinformatics course is too specific. So would I be better to not (entirely) specialise and save myself a bunch of troubles (moving etc.) doing Computer Science + Genetics at UWA or specialise early near the jobs and so on at UNSW?

The thing is, I need to do a kind of alignment that BLAST can't do itself. More specifically, I need to align a set of disjoint subsets (i.e. domains) of the query protein (these are given as input) against the full sequence of the proteins in the database that BLAST searches. This requires that I give zero weight to start and end gaps (same as a local alignment), but also give zero weight to gaps between domains, while keeping the penalty for gaps within the sequence of each domain.

BLAST itself will allow you to set the gap penalty, but afaik it won't allow you to set a different gap penalty based on location.",,False,,t5_2qh0x,False,,,True,t3_zr2wo,http://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/zr2wo/question_about_blast/,

I have taken 3 Bioinformatics classes one was an intro level went over BLAST/FASTA and other algorithms, one was the senior seminar course for the bioinformatics major. The other course was all about processing large sets of data and used neural networks and a couple other software tools to look at microarray data and do some more molecular based analysis.

I am writing after hours of searching and frustration. Here is my issue:

I know of the work of a Max Little. He gave a TedMed talk this year.

Ever since hearing about his multi-database, multi-algorithm approach to everything, I have been trying to find a way to quickly determine whether a data source with given information exists or not. In fact, since seeing it, I have been a bit.. well.. obsessed with the possibilites for it, especially in my field (healthcare).

But my problem is this:

I do not know how to easily search for databases that could be useful to me. I have been looking through sites like data.gov, GHDx, IHME, etc., but all the looking I am doing is very inefficient and often I come up empty handed.

Example:

I would love access to data from routine labs for people with a given diagnosis, like heart failure.

For example, CBC or complete metabolic panel for patients with a diagnosis of Lupus. Heck, just to make it easy, lets say, I would love to find a database containing lab data for any diagnosis whatsoever!!

If you are reading this and have any suggestions for how I can do this, please let me know. If you are just a complete saint and would actually be willing to email, skype, or talk to me, I'd appreciate it a ton. 

Thank you!

2) Blast those results back against the original query genome. Many times this will return something with a much higher score than the original query if there is a common domain or something.

I'm now realizing that there is probably some very basic process for automated homolog finding which is mroe effective than my method. Do you have any suggestions about where I should look for further info? Does my approach seem reasonable?
Thanks!

To give you an idea, I've worked in a wet cell bio lab, a cardiac tissue engineering lab, worked with clinicians to find trends in patient data, and even worked in a cleanroom fabricating substrates to grow cells on. I have a very strong understanding of biology on the cellular level as well as mathematics (at least as related to engineering). I'm also not afraid to dive into new topics.

2. The one constant across all of the settings I've worked in has been performing a solid amount of data analysis and statistics. In my spare time I've taken up learning how to program. This mostly grew out of writing MATLAB code for engineering classes and doing some modeling for my grad research. I always wanted to incorporate more coding into my research but didn't really have the time. In terms of formal CS training, I took a systems programming course on a whim in undergrad and aced it without too much trouble.

I am trying to identify the conserved portions of a protein degredation domain which is covalently attached to proteins via tmRNA. The tag is encoded by normal RNA-&gt;AA rules in the tmRNA and I have been able to identify the tag sequence in most of the 65 sequenced genomes of the phylum of interest.

My main difficulty is how to interpret this data to conclude which positions in the protein tag are the most highly conserved. My first inclination would be to simply find the distibution of amino acids at each position in the tag with reference to the stop codon at the end of the tag. I see two major faults in this method though.

1. It does not account for insertions/deletions which can shift sequences which still would remain conserved but would not be identified as such with the above method.

2. It is biased towards the motifs of organisms which have had multiple different strains sequenced.

So my question is how to identify conserved elements within a motif? Is the a standard method or program which is used?

My only current thought of an improvement is to address point 2 by weighting the sequences by how phylogenetically dissimiliar they are to the others.

Any of you guys familiar with both topics and can point me in the direction or offer any insight?

I'm working with a series of highly related genes (there are 7 of them) and we're trying to develop good primers for each (Tm of 55-63 celsius) that will not prime with something other than our target. The problem is, most of the common primer design software (read free like Primer3 or NCBI) will not compare the primer generated with the genetic source. Therefore I have to individually align each possible primer with each gene using software like Multalin. You can see how this gets exponentially hard (each primer requires 7 individual searches, and maybe only 1 in 6 primers works).

So, my question is, is there ANY software out there that will both design a PCR primer AND compare the primer for undesired matches against other sequences. Or has anyone figured out a work around?

I'm a biology major and I have some experience with coding (Perl, Java) but basically no experience with statistics (I am taking statistics next semester)

Anyway, I have data but I don't know what to do with it. 

I have these sequences which are known to be highly mutagenic. I took the parent sequence, aligned it (using consensus sequences) to variant sequences and checked if there was a base pair mutation.

So my data looks like this: I have conserved A,T,G,C (no change from parent to variant) and then I have all possible changes (A=&gt;G, A=&gt;C, G=&gt;A etc). as counts (like A was replaced with G six times in this sequence).

I was thinking about doing a ratio of mutated to conserved, but I'm certain is is a bad approach.

What would be the next logical step?

Thanks a lot!


**EDIT:** The sequences are hypervariable immunoglobluin sequences. I am looking at the complementary determining region and seeing if there is a preference for a nucleotide bias during an infection. A paper has shown that these neutralizing Igs bind to the virus with greater affinity after some time the patient has been infected with said virus. The paper has noticed a change in amino acid sequence in the CDR which shows a greater affinity to the envelope.

What my lab is trying to prove is that it is the change in nucleotide sequence towards a certain bias mimics the mutation bias of the virus. According to the mutation data I have, it does show a substitution preference like the virus. 

I want to show that these Igs have the same bias as the virus but it doesn't mean anything with just the nucleotide substitution counts

This might be a good method for larger sequences, where transpositions occur more regularly.

We are beginning to get involved in more computationally intense work -- lots of ChIP(-seq, -chip) and next gen sequencing -- and are looking at expanding our computational capacity.  We currently rely on a few 32-bit iMacs to do the bulk of our computing.  The way we see it currently, we have the following options:
1.  Do our big stuff using a cloud service like Amazon's EC2.
2.  Purchase time on our university's cluster.
3.  Build a local computing grid.
The first two of these options do not appear to be cost-effective for us at this time, and the third appears to be too costly in terms of construction and maintenance.
We are more interested in the following options:
4.  Purchase a MacPro and use it as a dedicated computer for alignment and analysis.
5.  Purchase an IBM x-series server and use it for the same purpose (using a Linux distro).
6.  Construct a small in-lab cluster.
Most of our current computers are Apple, and everyone in the lab is comfortable with Mac OS and are a little reluctant to switch to Linux.  Personally, I think that going the IBM route would be best for us.  The servers appear to be pretty good and I think it would be relatively painless for the lab to transition to Linux, especially since most of the analysis we do is based on Python scripts.

So, I'd just like to know:
How do other molecular biology or biochemistry labs do their bioinformatics?
If we were to purchase our own hardware, what would people recommend?
It seems like every bioinformatics book recommends the LAMP toolkit, but will we have any issues finding software or applications for Linux that my lab-mates are used to using on Mac OS?

It was a pretty slick looking website, with a large search bar. It would autocomplete gene names for you. Its functionality was pretty simple, as it would analyze the genes you fed it through a list and then tell you which pathways were affected via a table to the right side of the page. The art style was very cartoonish, using vector graphics. The animation and snappiness makes me think it was made using HTML5.

I think it said that it was powered by cytoscape.js

Any idea of what it could be? I found it a lot easier to use than GSEA.

But the ""Category"" vignette illuminated a lot of different concepts (not only the ones relevant to that package, for example it helped me understand how to use rowttests). It achieved this by not shying away from the statistics, initially rigorous, then some heuristic arguments and also by the beauty of the exposition. In essence, it helped me understand the practical aspect of using Bioconductor, but also some of the relevant statistics.

I work on an insect model without any reference genome. We have about 16 transcriptomes (different tissues, stages, etc.) sequenced. I have done *de novo* assembly with nice results (using Illumina 105b long pair-end reads and oases / trinity).

There is one particular gene, that has two forms (let's say A and B) in insects and is present in both forms in some species, or only in one form in some other species. For our model, we are sure that it has var. A and we think (based on wetlab experiments) that the var. B is absent.

Is there a way how to ""prove"" absence of one of these variants in transcriptomic data?

 I have not found any transcript (from my assemblies) that would correspond to the var. B. I want to be as close to sure as possible, that for some reason the variant B didn't just disappear during the quality filtering/assembly.
What I thought about at first was blasting protein query (from some related insect var. B) to a database of raw, untreated reads. This resulted in some 2K raw reads, that I assembled and also mapped to the var.A form our gene. All but 40 reads aligned. and those 40 are most likely to be from ""var. A"" as well.

Any thoughts?

Today I had an interview with the Center for Bioinformatics at my school which is mostly run by people with a biological background. The main problem he said for them is that most software for Bioinformatics isn't created with usability in mind; e.g. that people with an only biological background have a really hard time figuring out how to use certain systems and that if *I* created solutions to these problems I would be a tremendous help. 

He mentioned things like making them not have to use the command line, creating GUIs for certain softwares, and in general just replacing really complex programs with more easily understood mechanics that a biological-only background person could understand.

This was all a bit much for me because I am just barely getting into the field. I was wondering if anyone has some ideas on how I can get started? Certain programs that need help?

To do some comparisons, i wanted to look in mpileup etc. Unfortunately, SHRiMPs SAM output is incorrect and can't be used, so I went to try bwa. I found some terrifying things.

Basically the pipeline is:
solid2fastq.pl
bwa index -c
bwa aln -c
Samtools, etc

First, the Perl script is just wrong, and doesn't take into account the two base encoding. I thought maybe they do the crazy transliteration (tr/01234/ACGTN/) and then the aln function does the right encoding and deals with cs errors like SHRiMP. Nope. It's just wrong (unless I am horribly mistaken).  So I wrote my own conversion script and ran that through the pipeline... Mpileup basically gave me nothing (i should have 10's of thousands of calls) ...I then pretended my cs2bs fastq files were real Illumina reads and ran bwa as so (something you should never do). It actually worked better than using the c flags, but still gave wrong mappings when seq errors existed (comparing with shrimp). It's frustrating, but I think we are just going to have to convert shrimps prettyprint output to a correct SAM (using norm-odds to calculate MAPQ, which is arguably better than Li and Durbans MAPQ)

I'm just a humble biology postdoc, but find myself doing all my own bioinformatics these days and wouldn't have in any other way.  What I need to do is to be able to manipulate data files such as FASTA genome sequences (and maybe FASTQs as well), VCF reports, GFF and EMBL files, etc.  Ideally I'd love to be able to write a little program that could, say, take a coding SNP and its position and output the sequence of the gene, whether it is a synonymous or non-synonymous change, the 200 basepairs flanking the SNP, and the gene annotation.

R is usually my go-to program for data manipulation and I do most of my scripting just in UNIX, believe it or not.   I know some perl, some python, and some C (but just the basics).  I know what loops are and if/else structures, etc., but I really don't have much experience.  In other words, I am basically naive but primed to learn quickly.

Any advice on what scripting language to learn to do all this?  Can is just be done in R?  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: I should add that I am not using human data, or even a published genome.  The annotations are still pretty raw, but at least in a codified format.  Thus ready-made tools like GATK or SNPeff are not as useful, as they rely on published and frequently used genome sequences and annotations.

So far I have received my sample's nucleotide sequence. I then used BLASTn to find similar sequences and the top hits included various baleen whales, i.e. omura's whale and the common minke whale. Based on these, i want to make sure that my sample belongs to an Omura whale so I created a distance tree using GENEIOUS with top hits from my blast search along with a couple other marine mammals (other baleen whales and other whales, gray, blue, etc.). Based on that tree, I noted that the patristic distances between my two suspected whales differed by about 0.0030. (The common minke whale having a smaller distance and therefore more genetically identical) 

From this information I concluded that I have a common minke whale....Do you guys agree? How else can I be more accurate in my discovery? Does translating my nucleotide sequence to protein and then BLASTing provide more accurate results?

I'm going to blab on about my whole situation, but there's a TL;DR at the end if you want me to get to the point :)

I recently graduated from the a top CS university in Canada (Waterloo) with a bachelor of CS, Bioinformatics option. I had 5 internships throughout my undergrad career, and spent most of them in tech companies in Silicon Valley. When I graduated, I was lured into San Francisco by the big money, and that's what I've been doing for the past year. But I've realized that I don't particularly enjoy this too much, and that got me thinking about what I do like. I remember that in university I enjoyed some of my bio courses, I enjoyed some CS courses, but all the Bioinformatics courses were always the most interesting and fun to me. Which made me realize that maybe I should follow that route instead of the pure CS route.
So I started looking for bioinformatics jobs and pretty much everything I saw required a PhD. So now I'm thinking of going back to grad school and get a Master's in bioinformatics (I don't want to commit to 5-6 years of a PhD, I'd rather do 2 years first to see if I like it). The hope is that I will really like it and then want to continue on to PhD and live happily ever after. And if I don't enjoy it too much, well then I can always come back to Silicon Valley and be unhappy but at least rich..? :p

My question is what program exactly am I supposed to look for in grad school? I'm looking mainly at Canadian universities, probably University of Toronto. I was hoping to just find a ""Bioinformatics"" program, but instead I found faculty members in either the Biology department or the CS department working on bioinformatics. Do you think that doing there will be large differences between doing a master's in bioinformatics through Biology vs through CS? Do you think that the job market will react better to one or the other? If you have any other piece of advice or information that can help, that would be appreciated too.

I've done MDS and ANOSIM analysis (in addition to OTU and taxonomic analysis) to show these two groups of animals form clusters, and have significantly different microbial community compositions.

The reviewer wants to know if the gut communities within the control group (animal to animal) are more/less variable than within the other group. Does anyone know how to perform this calculation?

I seek to calculate the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (w = dN/dS) for 1) an unidentified open reading frame (uORF) that is present in four strains of the same species and 2) for a mitochondrial gene present in 9 species with a total of 18 strains. 

How do I know which codon substitution model I should apply to determine the dN/dS ratio? I'm aware that I'll need to compare a null model vs. an alternative model but there are several. Which models should I compare? Should I compare all of the models (M7 vs M8, M1a vs. M2a, etc) and discuss each comparison? 

In the first example, I'd like to determine the selective regime the uORF is under, and if it is undergoing purifying selection I'd also like to determine which codons or amino acids are under selective pressure. Are four sequences sufficient for a comparison?

In the second example, the gene is known to be undergoing positive selection (relaxed selective constraint - variable among species) but it also might be interesting to identify which amino acids are under purifying selection. 

I'm familiar with command line, not so much with tree building, and am unsure how to compare the null vs. alternative model to determine significance. 

I know this is a lot, but I would appreciate any help I could get. If you need me to elaborate on anything I would be more than happy to.

On the [RCSB Software Tools page](http://sw-tools.pdb.org/), there is a link to [db-loader](http://sw-tools.pdb.org/apps/DB-LOADER/index.html).  I have downloaded the latest version, which compiled nicely and without any modifications on Mac (no such luck in Ubuntu for whatever reason, but no biggie).

I have all the RCSB data in both .pdb and .cif formats.  There are actually a couple of problems, however.  The biggest problem is that, despite having read all the documentation and examples, I can't seem to figure out how to use the db-loader program.  I was hoping that maybe someone here had used it before, and can help me out with a couple of examples.  Secondly, as I mentioned, I actually need to use postgresql instead of mysql.  I was wondering if it would be easier to modify the program to work with postgresql, or to just upload the data to mysql and convert it to postgresql from there.

There are small overlaps in some of my contigs, so I need to use part of the contig sequence, not the whole thing.  Cases where the contig is ""+"" orientation are fine, but in cases where the contig is ""-"" orientation, should I take coordinates from the contig as is and reverse complement them, or should I take the reverse complement of the whole contig and then take coordinates from it?

The file type specification says:
""Coordinates of the object [assembly] are all with respect to the plus strand, no matter the orientation of the component [contig]."", but I find this ambiguous as relating to the component coordinates and orientation. 

e.g. if the sequence I need from contig1 (length=150bp) is bases 50-125 reverse complemented, do I need to specify
 
start=50, end=125, orientation= -

The proteins need to be anchored to the inside of the cell membrane, and one of the ways in which we tried to accomplish that is with an N-terminal fusion to a surface marker protein (in this case a truncated version of CD19, which we call t19). This ended up not working so well, and when examined through flow cytometry I saw that CD19 was only detected in very low amounts on the surfaces of cells infected with my vector (it is normally quite high with the t19 sequence only). To investigate further I infected cells with the same vector at various stages of construction - first with the t19 domain only, then with t19 and the second domain, then the complete construct with all three domains (each around 1kb). CD19 levels were high at first but dropped off sharply after the second domain was added. At first I reasoned that a larger protein/transcript just wont be translated/transcribed as quickly or efficiently, but my boss suggested that I take another look at the hydrophobicity plot of the entire construct just to make sure I hadn't accidentally removed/added another transmembrane region.

Here's where things start to get weird: using the [TMHMM Server](http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) utility, I entered in the sequences for t19 and my completed construct to see predictions for transmembrane regions and extracellular/cytosolic domains. t19/CD19 has a very large peak for transmembrane probability around amino acid 300, as expected. t19 just cuts the last 200 or so amino acids of CD19 right after this region. However, there is also a small bump around amino acid 80, but it is very low in probability. The strange thing is that when looking at the complete sequence of my protein this bump is now close to 100% probability. Even weirder, If I take the complete sequence and chop off progressively larger chunks from the C terminus until I eventually get back to t19 only, I can see the height of this peak drop smoothly until it is back at its original value. So it seems like, according to the algorithm at least, the rest of the protein is somehow making the area around amino acid 80 more likely to be a transmembrane region. This is not something I thought was possible, I was sure this was a local property that wouldn't be affected by distant regions of the sequence, but protein misfolding would explain some of the problems I've been having. So, does anyone know if this could possibly be a real effect, or just a problem with the prediction algorithm used?",,False,,t5_2qh0x,False,,,True,t3_152bmd,http://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/152bmd/transmembrane_prediction_weirdness/,

i just started my PhD thesis and was wondering if anybody here had some advice for me.
I'm a computer scientist. My Master thesis project was to create a framework to align NGS data, detect variants, visualize it and create reports from that data. The focus was put on usability, so that people with no CS background can use it. I was able to do this quite well, it concluded in a software i'm still maintaining that is used in at least 2 laboratories. I touched every step of the NGS diagnostics process.  Raw data filtering, Raw data statistics generation, Alignment, Variant detection, Coverage analysis, Alignment visualization, integration with online resources like ensembl etc etc. I'm no expert in any domain, but i have a good understanding in all of them (at least good enough to create good software for all of this).

Now for my PhD. The general idea is to bring the NGS analysis software to the cloud or distribute to workload on a grid.
My problem is, it seems like everything has been done before. The only processing step worth distributing is the alignment (perhaps i'm wrong on that?). There are several ways to do this already, either on a cluster in a grid on a cloud, it seems like there is nothing new i can add there. Same thing goes for GPU aided alignment. It has been done, and it seems to work. Simply adapting one of those solutions and making it very userfriendly so that it intergrates into what i have already done is not enough for a PhD. 

So my question to you, what are the current unsolved problems in that domain? My domain is more the creation of tools than analysing ""real"" data (i have no biology background). As its just the start of my PhD i might also not be totally clear on how ""big"" my project should be.

However, none of the p-values are very significant after multiple-testing correction because there are a lot of conditions, two incompletely crossed variables, and no replicates (!!!). We can see that the test is putting the genes in the right order and the top hits do look real, but we don't have an objective criterion to define any kind of cutoff.

However, we still want to do an analysis for gene ontology (GO) term enrichment. Normally you'd apply your cutoff and just ask whether each GO term is overrepresented in the significant genes vs. the insignificant ones (by a hypergeometric test), but we can't because we don't have a reasonable threshold. On the other hand, our data are highly quantitative (high-throughput sequencing) and we really trust the p-values as continuous numbers, even if we can't threshold on them.

So I'm wondering if there's a reasonable way I can avoid thresholding and just say ""the genes with this GO term have a much stronger effect, of the kind we tested for, than genes without the GO term"".

I'm going to blab on about my whole situation, but there's a TL;DR at the end if you want me to get to the point :)

I recently graduated from the a top CS university in Canada (Waterloo) with a bachelor of CS, Bioinformatics option. I had 5 internships throughout my undergrad career, and spent most of them in tech companies in Silicon Valley. When I graduated, I was lured into San Francisco by the big money, and that's what I've been doing for the past year. But I've realized that I don't particularly enjoy this too much, and that got me thinking about what I do like. I remember that in university I enjoyed some of my bio courses, I enjoyed some CS courses, but all the Bioinformatics courses were always the most interesting and fun to me. Which made me realize that maybe I should follow that route instead of the pure CS route.
So I started looking for bioinformatics jobs and pretty much everything I saw required a PhD. So now I'm thinking of going back to grad school and get a Master's in bioinformatics (I don't want to commit to 5-6 years of a PhD, I'd rather do 2 years first to see if I like it). The hope is that I will really like it and then want to continue on to PhD and live happily ever after. And if I don't enjoy it too much, well then I can always come back to Silicon Valley and be unhappy but at least rich..? :p

My question is what program exactly am I supposed to look for in grad school? I'm looking mainly at Canadian universities, probably University of Toronto. I was hoping to just find a ""Bioinformatics"" program, but instead I found faculty members in either the Biology department or the CS department working on bioinformatics. Do you think that doing there will be large differences between doing a master's in bioinformatics through Biology vs through CS? Do you think that the job market will react better to one or the other? If you have any other piece of advice or information that can help, that would be appreciated too.

I do enjoy coding(decent at C++, excel), but I don't want to become a software engineer like the rest of my family. Biology+compsci seems more interesting than just programming. However, most of the bioinformatics colleges were all grad school, so I thought I would just stick with computer science.

Math 162................Statistics for Bioinformatics

CS 123A..............................Bioinformatics I

CS 123B.............................Bioinformatics II



I also found this ""bioinformatics track"" under the school's website, that also summarizes the classes I stated above:

Creating a gene list ranked by signal-to-noise ratio with the ""GSEA.GeneRanking"" function was simple enough, but I haven't been able to get the ""GSEA.EnrichmentScore"" function to work. I'm a little confused about how to:

* input the ranked list (presumably the one created from the GeneRanking function?) into the EnrichmentScore (ES) function in the correct format.
*  input my gene sets into the ES function (i.e. how to create an object that defines a gene set)

I'm sure these are relatively simple questions, but any help is appreciated.

I have a Bachelor's in Bio with courses heavy in microbiology, with a little statistics and no CS. 

I've always thought I'd continue on to a molecular bio Ph.D , but recently I've starting losing interest in that route and started thinking about getting a masters instead (shorter commitment, no interest in becoming a PI, etc). I looked at various biotechnology masters programs, but bioinformatics/comp bio programs also caught my eye.

I've always been interested in genetics/genomics, especially in the context of microbio (metagenomics, microbiomes, etc). Problem is, I haven't taken any CS courses which are prereqs for all these programs. Right now I'm trying hard to learn programming concepts through Coursera and other sites, and I feel it's very challenging/fun so far.

I guess my question is: Would a master's in bioinformatics be a valid choice for me, and if so what would be a good way to gain CS and bioinformatics experience? Are online courses for credit such as [this one](http://www.extension.harvard.edu/courses/intensive-introduction-computer-science) at Harvard Extension School recommended?

I found out about the field through a job posting two months ago that still has not been filled as of today. Would it possibly be worth my time to apply to it while stressing my background in biology to help cover my weakness in programming? Or should I consider taking some classes at a community college and get an associate's first?r",,False,,t5_2qh0x,False,,,True,t3_lzdsq,http://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/lzdsq/very_little_programming_experience_bachelors_in/,

I have ran two sets of microarrays for independent experiments.  Now I would like to compare the data from the experiments, yet they are one two different chip types: one on Affymetrix Mouse430_2 (6 samples) and one on Affymetrix Mouse430A_2 (9 samples).  


I want to import the resulting CEL files into a single experimental file in Partek.  This will be 15, non matched samples (with replicates included).  Since there are two chip types present, I have to set up a sample information file, which is where I am having my trouble.  Does anyone have experience with the sample information file?  The one listed in the Partek tutorial allows for two chip if and only if all samples have a CEL file from each chip type.  Is there a way I can leave a sample blank for a given chip type (it currently will not let me)? 

Can this be done in Partek?  Or is there a way I can work around the two chip type issue?  If I do the normalization in R, can I output a file type that will be independent of chip type, or am I still looking at the same problem?  I am open to using whatever tools I need to figure this out.  


Any help you can offer would be appreciated, (please do not just post to use bioconductor, or other similar programs, unless you can point me to a specific tutorial).
