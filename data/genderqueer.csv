Please feel free to let me know what you'd like to see change around the subreddit, or if there's anything you'd like to know about me personally, please ask and I will answer to the best of my ability.

I care deeply about those of us who live outside the usual gender binary, and it means worlds to me to be chosen to moderate this community.

My first question to you, however, is whether I should re-instate the old mods. Though they may be absent, I would not want them to return to find that I have ""usurped"" their position... I want to build on the subreddit of the past, I do not wish to overturn it. On the other hand, having empty names on the moderator list is not *entirely* honest, nor would it be very useful.

I try hard to be an approachable, helpful resource, so please feel free to message me through the handy moderator mail system (it's on the sidebar, where it says ""message the moderators"") or send me a PM directly. If you've got problems, or a suggestion where I can improve something, or even just a heads up every once in a while, please let me know and I will be happy to be there for you. I will do my best to reply to any messages in a swift and prompt manner.

It's a huge change. I think it will take getting some used to (didn't realize how much I used to hide behind my hair!) But the hair dresser was just so lovely and knew exactly what I was looking for. I've spent my whole life hiding my face, because I felt like my feminine features didn't fit on my angular bone structure, or some shit like that. But now it's like... hello face. I can see you as a whole instead of a bunch of parts that don't fit together. I'm still a little lost on styling and good outfits but I have almost two weeks before school starts.

Struggling a little bit with seasonal depression/social isolation (roommates are still gone) and sometimes when I'm walking around fretting/feeling poop, the hair seems really jarring. But the hair is off, and I can either hide or I can walk outside with my head held high and smile when I can.

I've been trying some guided imagery when I feel really lost, like some picture of how I want to look. I'm trying to picture myself looking confident and handsome. What that would look like. I've also been doodling in the same vein, which is funny, because in younger life that was the only place I felt comfortable expressing a more androgynous self. 

This is scary! But also very, very exciting. And tumultuous. And it's bringing up a lot of really intense feelings, some of them that have been  locked away for a long time. I've been goofing around on the internet too much the last few days so I think after I post this I'm going to go try to get some things done and not dwell.

I don't know why it works, but I'm going with it",fareven,47,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/19prfq/first_couple_of_days_of_gender_transgressions_i/,"Male here, married, kids.  I'd been running into this gray rut of apathy and depression for years, gradually, like a frog being boiled to death in water that gets hot too slow for him to notice.  A negative voice was my constant mental companion, whispering to me that I'd made wrong choices, that nobody would care if I died, even helpfully conjuring dark scenarios to 'help' me figure out how to dramatically end everything, either alone or even with lots of company.  Not to be too maudlin about it, but I was too miserably apathetic to even consider getting help, the idea that things could get better seemed childishly ridiculous.

I was getting dressed two days ago and I sat there holding my clothes, looking at a pair of my wife's underwear that was sticking out of a drawer.  I still don't know where it came from, this impulse to put them on.  All I know is that the moment they slid up my hips it felt like my skull...loosened.  Like a squeeze of pressure that had been there so long it was considered normal was gone.

I felt...better.  For the first time in what might be a decade I felt like things were going to be OK, in a life where before I hadn't ever even thought of that as an option.  I didn't know why or how things were going to be OK, it just seemed like everything being OK was as normal as the sun coming up in the morning.

I let the feeling push me along that afternoon.  It just didn't seem right to be wearing ""such pretty panties"" (they were actually more underwear than panties, I'm not sure of the difference but the cheery melody in my head happily didn't care) while still having so much body hair on my legs and arms, so I shaved everywhere I could reach, getting it smooth and nice as best I could.  I was clumsy about it in some places, one leg has some cuts that still sting a bit, but I was even cheerful about that.  I tried on the contact lenses that my wife had pushed me to try months and months ago, and the inconvenience of putting them in that had so annoyed me - I'd only worn them for a couple of days at first - seemed silly, they made me look good and I could see my eyes.  I put my black metal hard-edged glasses away, hoping I wouldn't have to wear them much again.

My wife noticed her underwear sticking out of my clothes a little bit that evening when I was leaning over to load the washing machine, and she laughed harder than I'd heard her laugh in years.  The kids wondered what was going on, we told them a story about me making a face that just caught her off guard.  Later she had some questions, I told her that I was in a silly mood...she accepted it, but was wondering if I was OK - and she was a little put off at me taking her things without asking.

Yesterday was a Monday.  A dark, grey-skied wintry Monday, at a job that had been grinding me down.  I walked to work wearing a pair of satiny women's underwear under my regular clothing, my sharp-edged glasses sitting at home, and everything was beautiful.  The slippery sidewalks were like a game, the wintry breeze was invigorating, the black birds against the white snow were poetic...I laughed out loud at nothing in particular while walking to work...and that nagging, whispering negative voice, for the first time since I could remember, was completely silent.

All through the day and into the evening I was cheerful.  The computer games and endless Internet scanning that I'd been numbingly retreating into for years didn't attract my interest - I cleaned things up instead, did what I could to make my house as pretty and cheerful as I felt inside.  I participated in the evening meal's conversation, I watched tv while actually chatting with family members - and none of it was pretend or forced, it all just felt right.

That night, when we were alone, I told my wife about how I'd felt happy all day, and I told her about the existence of the negative voice and how it had gone suddenly, wonderfully silent.  She was happy for me, happy I'd shared it with her, felt sad for me that I'd been facing it so long.  We laughed together about it, I can love how this experiment is affecting me and still know feel that there's a silliness to it.  She's worried about what I'm going through, and still doesn't quite know how to process her man wearing her underwear.

I'm in my second full day in women's underwear.  The happiness is still bubbling along inside, and I hope it's come to stay for a while.  I find myself taking stairs instead of elevators as my job takes me from building to building and office to office, because I want my body - not ""this body"", but ""my body"" - to feel healthier and look better.  I look at myself in the mirror and smile...and a different voice, not a whisper but full of life, told me that people love me, that what I do is important, and that I'm worth caring about.

The new voice is a funny mix of encouragement to make things better and happiness with how I am.  I don't have to change, but I would love it if I did...if I got healthier, maybe got rid of the grey hair that was creeping in...it isn't because I have to, or because of how I'll look to others, it's because it would be fun and make me feel good to do things for myself like that.

I tossed aside my regular deodorant this morning, used some nice fresh powder scented spray instead.  I wondered as I ""prettied up the kitchen"" (did the breakfast dishes and spruced things up) how far this would go.  My wife is a hairstylist...maybe if I grew my hair out a little, I could take a little step, get away from the boring old mannish cut, try something 'unisex'?

I should look for a therapist, figure out what's going on.  But seriously, I'll go out in heels and skirts if it turns out that's what it takes to keep my life on such a positive turn.

It's written for a general audience, not necessarily for those who are familiar with queer or gender theory. And I like I say in the opening paragraph, this is just *my* genderqueer manifesto. It's not meant to speak for anyone but me. Hopefully everyone who would want such a thing can and will write theirs too.

---

The very first thing I want you to notice is that this is titled *My* Genderqueer Manifesto. It's not *The* Genderqueer Manifesto nor even *A* Genderqueer Manifesto. This one is mine and no one else's. Just like my gender(s). And like my gender, I reserve the right to modify it on a whim, to update it to reflect new knowledge, and for it to be completely nonsensical to those outside of my head. Modifications, updates, and other changes may (and likely will) be made without this document ever being updated.

I am genderqueer.

In that big [QUILTBAG](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=QUILTBAG) in which so many of us hang out, you can find me in the Q and the G. G for genderqueer. Q for queer. But not Q for questioning. I'm not questioning. **I am the question.** My life, my identity, my practices are a big fucking question mark, and I love it that way.

**So what's it mean when I say I'm genderqueer?**

* It means sure, I'm a guy. Except when I'm not.
* It means sometimes I'm a girl too.  
* It means sometimes I'm neither, or both, or something else entirely.  
* It means I'm rarely a man, and even less often a woman.  
* It means that when I fix a car or build something that I don't feel manly or like I'm living up to the gender that is assigned to me. It means I'm really more of a tomboy in those moments.  
* It means that I'm not crossdressing when you see me in skirts and makeup. I'm not wearing women's clothes. I'm wearing *my* clothes, thank you very much.  
* It means you can refer to me as ""he."" Or ""she."" Or ""ze."" Or any other personal pronoun you prefer. They'll all be right enough, and I don't mind any of them. Well, except maybe ""it.""  
* It means that my beard is pretty and girly, at least when I want it to be.  

**So what does it not mean when I say that I'm genderqueer?**

* It does not mean that I want to start taking hormones or have my body surgically modified. Some genderqueer people do. That's cool. It's not for me.  
* It does not mean that I'm under any obligation to make my identity apparent to others. Most days I'll be in slacks or jeans and a button down. You'll likely not actively notice anything about my gender.  
* It does not have any bearing on my sexual orientation. I'm mostly attracted to women, and also to other genderqueer folks. I'm sometimes attracted to guys. None of that has anything to do with my gender identity nor with my gender expression. I'm just omnomsexual. ^1    
* It does not mean that I feel I was born in the wrong body. I fit my body perfectly. I am my body. My gender and my body are inseparable, but that doesn't mean that I let others assignation of gender to my body limit me.  

I notice that my expression of gender varies along with where I am on the extraversion/introversion spectrum. The more extraverted I am, the more stereotypically feminine I am likely to appear. The more introverted I am, the more stereotypically guy my appearance will be.

Usually.

But no matter my expression, I am always genderqueer.

Even when you can't see my queerness, it is there. It is who I am. It is how I am. Forget that if you prefer. My queerness is not your responsibility, and it does not need your recognition. But forget it at the risk of failing to see and understand me.

&gt; Queer is a territory of tension, defined against the dominant narrative of white-hetero-monogamous-patriarchy, but also by an affinity with all who are marginalized, otherized and oppressed. Queer is the abnormal, the strange, the dangerous. Queer involves our sexuality and our gender, but so much more. It is our desire and fantasies and more still. Queer is the cohesion of everything in conflict with the heterosexual capitalist world. Queer is a total rejection of the regime of the Normal.

&gt; *[Toward The Queerest Insurrection](http://zinelibrary.info/toward-queerest-insurrection-0)* 

I refuse to let myself be managed and policed and limited by narrow, binary gender. I am both/and/neither/nor. I am ""Yes, ma'am,"" ""Yes, sir,"" and ""I don't know what to call you.""

I am a walking, talking, living, breathing question mark exploding every binary that tries to catch me.

Well, I say accidentally, since I meant to say it at the time, but I hadn't exactly planned it beforehand.  I was in training with a handful of coworkers and my manager, and the topic was political correctness under a ""communicating with respect"" theme.  

Essentially the argument came up over unisex toilets.  Two people in the room commented that they felt confronted and uncomfortable in unisex toilets that had been installed at a local attraction, and that their existence was an unnecessary political correctness.  I responded that having the option there was very important to certain demographics (i.e. the trans* and queer folk of the world).


They commented that so few people fell into that category that it didn't really matter.  I said that more people did than they knew; and that in fact *I* did.  I said straight up that I don't identify as my birth-assigned gender.  I challenged them and asked whether I had the right to have the option of using a bathroom where *I* felt comfortable.


One of the two thought about what I'd said, and said that she hadn't thought about it that way before, and in that light she could see why it was more important than she'd considered (she is pretty cool).  The other clearly wasn't as accommodating, but allowed that he couldn't hold it against me personally, and since we were in a training that was all about communicating with respect he couldn't really say any more (thankfully).


Through all this, my manager sat and observed pensively.  I tried not to look at his reactions while I was talking; while I think very highly of him considering the short period I've worked under him, and knew he'd be professional about it, I was still worried about what he would think on a personal level.

Immediately after the discussion concluded, I couldn't help but steal a glance at him. ...He looked pleased.  Genuinely, satisfied and pleased.  I don't think he had any idea beforehand (I had been presenting as totally cis, new workplace and all), but he's always said he values diversity very highly and is something of a champion for a few minority groups' recognition and rights in our business.


After the training concluded, he didn't say a word.  We went back to our team and work proceeded as normal, but he *did* seem to be in a good mood for the rest of the afternoon.  I now feel like I can come into work presenting as myself in future and that it will be totally ok- though I'll ease into it, for my own sake as much as anyone else's!


Best.  Manager.  EVER.  I'm not even out to my family; how many people can say that their workplace is their Safe Place?



**TL;DR: My manager is awesome and my workplace is the best.**

All my life I have gotten shit for doing anything other people perceived as ""girly"" or ""not manly enough."" Wearing my hair long. Eating a fucking salad. Steering me away from glasses that look in any way feminine, meaning small or bright colored I guess. Apparently I'm supposed to chase women, but I'm not really so inclined and I suck at it when I do. My only successes in that department seem to come from them making moves on me. I want to try eyeliner, but I feel like that would cause a shitstorm. Maybe I can use Halloween as an excuse? I'm just listing the stuff that sets people off; I am masculine in other ways.

The thing is, I kind of like being a little more feminine, or at least not strictly adhering to one end of a spectrum. It's other people hating me and making me feel insecure that really fucks with my head. It strikes me as ridiculous how much family, friends, and strangers feel the need to reinforce and coerce my masculinity to keep me in line. I think before I would just go along with what people said and act like they wanted. I feel more rebellious now, but I'm still insecure and depressed about it. I think it has a little to do with recently discovering I'm 'bicurious.' I don't really know what label to use - I feel like there's more to it than that - but I don't want to go on a big tangent. The point is, it was like taking the red pill, so to speak. Before I went through life being a straight guy, and now I'm finding out I'm not as straight as I thought, or maybe, as other people would like me to be. So even though I haven't come out or anything, I feel less reason to go around assuring people I'm straight, and manly, and totally not gay.

I wonder if maybe I acted more obviously effeminate or androgynous, then people wouldn't feel like they had the right to correct me. Maybe they would still make fun of me behind my back, but wouldn't say it to my face. I'm not sure exactly how I come across to other people, but I'm guessing they perceive me as mainly straight or dudely so they find it jarring when I do something inconsistent with that image.

I saw muscle, bones, and skin. I liked the way my muscles looked under my skin when they moved. I liked the way my ribs and clavicles were visible. I saw fat, scars, hair, and acne. I liked the way they decorated my body. I saw my breasts. They just hung there, and I looked at them and put them into perspective. They were just organs. Organs like any other organ, but they were they way they were because that's how mammals are. I don't ever plan on using them for their intended purpose, because I never want to have children, but they were indeed there. 

For the first time, I saw myself as a human mammal, who happened to be female. I did not see a ""woman."" I did not see a ""hot chick."" I did not see a ""sexy lady."" I did not see myself as someone who was put in the wrong body. I saw myself, my body. I saw a regular human. It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw, because for the first time I did not see myself as sexual or gendered. Just a living being. I cried because I was happy to see myself in this way, but I also cried because I knew this moment was fleeting.

I cried because I wish I could go outside and interact with other humans without being sexualized and expected to look or act a certain way based on my femaleness. I cried because I hate how I am treated a certain way just because of my genetics. I cried because no one could see the beauty that I saw in myself as a naked human being, without seeing me as something sexual.

I have to constantly remind myself, ""My body is strong. I am capable of many things. I can run for miles and I know how to fight. I am smart and knowledgeable. I am a scientist and I understand the way things work in a unique way. I am doing great things for the world and my community through my actions.""

I am a human that just happens to be female. I am not defined by my sex. My sex does not define my role in life, my actions, or the way people should treat me. I am just a human being, and I must live my life as such. 

You are all beautiful as well. Regardless of your identity, sex, gender (or lack of), dysphoria, acceptance, or expression, you are all beautiful human beings, capable of many wonderful things, and you all deserve to be happy with yourselves and with your lives.

Every male has a (mostly black/gray/brown/blue) T-shirt and denim pants on and that's all. There are a very few designs to choose from, a narrow variety of colors and I don't want to fit in. I would like to wear colorful things, t-shirts with vibrant-colored patterns, rainbow-striped long socks, or loosy sheer dress on a warm day. But wearing any of these things draws way too much attention from the surrounding (and I still have some social anxiety about that).

I don't want to dress as a woman. I want that these forms of cloting not to be considered female-only. I want the same freedom for men what every woman have. (And the same rights for the woman, that every man have. Feminism, ftw!)

It seems to me, that the role of the genders in our society is considered far too much important, that it really is. Males and females are seeing each other as they were different species. But the biological differences are pretty small. I dream of a genderless society.

I never felt being masculine the way the society showed me. I like my own male body, my only problem is my social gender. I simply hate the gender-binary.

Luckily, I moved to a different country previous year and started experimenting more with my gender. I wore skirts out in the public, I slowly, partly came out to even closer friends of mine. I enjoy the support of ~~my~~ an amazing girlfriend, who understands and supports me. I began to feel, what looks good (or at least: okay) on me.

I like to push the limits slowly; if I am wearing a skirt, then I avoid the bright colors to compensate the ""weirdness"" some way. The more important people I meet, the harder it gets to show myself.

Finally, I share some pictures with you, dear redditors. And no, I'm not creating a throwaway account. http://imgur.com/a/0Sqzd

My wife sent the store manager packing, though the store manager did say this was only OK ""as long as no one complained"", and my wife and I had a laugh about it later.

I'd decided that while I really appreciated my wife letting me wear her underwear, I really wanted some of my own - so in addition to milk and bread and all the other knick-nacks of running a family, some pretty soft underthings were going into that shopping cart.

I was a bit nervous, this was really the first time I'd ever walked through the heart of our Wal-Mart's women's section much less sorted through merchandise.  I didn't want much, since I wasn't sure of my size - but when I saw a pack of satiny briefs I knew I wanted them.

I put them in the cart, and no alarms went off.  The gender police didn't swoop down on me, no mothers pulled their children away in shock, nobody laughed or pointed or rolled their eyes or anything - I was just a guy picking up stuff from the store, everyone in the aisles and the checkout completely ignored me, just like I'd hoped they would.

Funny thing was, when I got home, I noticed that I'd accidentally picked up a different size than I intended, two sizes smaller than I'd estimated from online sources, but they fit like they were made for me.

 The triggers for dysphoria tend to be things that explicitly remind me that being read as female sets me apart from men, even when the intention is meant well (e.g. Guys holding the door for me/offering to carry things for me/etc. because it's 'chivalrous' to do those things for a woman), or when I'm in a group of girls who are talking about things typically considered to be feminine, or just generally any situation that enforces the binary (e.g. clothes shopping). But there are also some reminders that don't faze me at all - for example, female pronouns don't bother me, but being called 'miss' or 'lady' doesn't feel right, although even then it's more a case of it taking me a moment to realise who they're referring to than any particular feeling of offense or discomfort.

So I've been wearing women's clothing for 2 weeks now, but I haven't been wearing a bra on campus.  This weekend I added the bra to my presentation and it was great.  Honestly, I was nervous before I did it but by the time I headed out I was totally comfortable and gave no shits.  I'm nervous about being on campus during the week so I might give myself a couple days for that... we'll see.


I've been waiting to start changing pronouns and my name until after graduation for the sake of simplicity because it's only 3 weeks away now.  Last night I was at a party with a lot of people I didn't know and few others I knew casually that I came out to.  People asked what name/pronouns I wanted to go by and my answer initially was Lily/female but after the first couple of people I just couldn't help myself and I just said fuck it and started introducing myself as Lily instead of Dleurp as Lily.  It was a great feeling.

I've never felt so comfortable or had so much fun at a party.  I'm usually totally awkward in big social situations, but this was just fantastic.  Plus, people told me I look hot so that was pretty awesome.

Of course, the one amazing, beautiful guy I met who seems open enough that he might be comfortable with dating me even though I'm early in transition is taken.  *sigh* oh well.

With every new step I take in feeling more and more like a woman I am reminded that my body is not where I want it to be and feeling sad for how much of my life I feel like I've missed out on because I've spent so long struggling with this subconciously.  But, things are getting better.  the positives far outweigh the struggles and I've been focusing on trying to just enjoy the process for what it is as a life experience.

""While aiding an androgynous race who lost a couple of members in an unmapped region of space, Riker falls for one of them, which can lead to trouble if detected, since the alien race does not endorse gender specificity.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708815/ ""

Good Ol' Riker.  Always falling in love with everyone.  The episode does an alright job, I don't know if it is perfect, but it's interesting.  Has a few really neat bits in it.  Like how on the alien's planet people who prefer a specific gender are shunned and ""treated.""  Interesting, if not obvious, commentary.

A quote from the episode:
""Soren: I am female. I was born that way. I have had those feelings, those longings, all of my life. It is not unnatural. I am not sick because I feel this way. I do not need to be helped. I do not need to be cured. What I need, and what all of those who are like me need, is your understanding. And your compassion. We have not injured you in any way. And yet we are scorned and attacked. And all because we are different. What we do is no different from what you do. We talk, and laugh. We complain about work. And we wonder about growing old. We talk about our families, and we worry about the future. And we cry with each other when things seem hopeless. All of the loving things that you do with each other, that is what we do. And for that, we are called misfits, and deviants, and criminals. What right do you have to punish us? What right do you have to change us? What makes you think you can dictate how people love each other?
Noor: I congratulate you, Soren. Your decision to admit your perversion makes it much more likely that we can help you.""

I don't necessarily feel male either. Gender is just something that isn't really on my mind as something I identify with unless someone else brings it up. Which they do.

Seven years ago, as soon as I was legally able, I started hormones and had surgery. I became relaxed, calm, comfortable, happier than I'd ever been. I felt like myself. I felt good in my own skin, finally.

Within the last year, something has disturbed that peace again. I dated someone who transitioned then decided they're genderqueer. At first I thought nothing of it. Gender is fluid, people change and have the right to define themselves how they see fit.

I guess it got under my skin, though. That and an old friend of mine who retransitioned years ago. More and more, I began to doubt the basis of my own gender, the one real certainty I'd held onto for the last decade.

What if I'm 'really' a woman and could only come to terms with that through this transition? Maybe I'm just a very odd sort of man. Or I could be something else altogether. I struggle with this option the most. In theory, I've always wholeheartedly supported genderqueer theory. Of course there are more than two genders, of course we can live outside of the restrictions this culture imposes. 

Part of me can't seem to see past those constraints. Even as I adore and support non-binary identity, a part of me struggles to hold their reality in mind. Is this just the external pressure of a culture that wants to erase any possibility other than 'woman' or 'man'? The same pressure I threw off to transition in the first place?

Then there's the practical aspect of my resistance to applying a non-binary identity to myself. How can I make it work in practice? Given that our culture does not recognize these gender possibilities, what gender would I rather be mistaken for? How to cope with dating, binarist sexualities? Socializing in general - explain yourself constantly and possibly alienate most people or let them make the mistakes that erase you?

Most of all, it doesn't feel right. I don't want this. I don't think I'm strong enough to live in the liminal space, to exist in between. I don't have the energy to fight for recognition 24/7, to face constant confusion and disgust, to worry about how people are reading me or which bathroom to use. I'm fairly out as trans and I do my best to educate the people around me, but I'm grateful that because of my passing privilege, when I don't feel like educating, I don't have to explain myself.

I'm sick of gender. I don't want to think about it all the time any more. I don't want to experiment, explore, grow my hair out or buzz it or deal with any of this. I stopped T a month or so ago for reasons not totally clear to me so I guess I'm in deep now. I just want to spend my energy on other things.

We don't really have particularly fixed gender roles in our relationship anyway, so I wasn't worried out that; but I know that she does like me looking fairly masculine and I suppose you never know how someone will react. 

Anyway the first thing she said was ""if that's what you need to be happy then go for it"" the second thing she said was ""but if you're going to be shaving your legs you're not using my bloody razor"". 

Talking about it a bit more we're just going to keep the communication open, and as long as I let her know when I'm going to be doing something or trying something new so that she can have a chance to process and it doesn't come as a surprise she's happy for me to do what I feel I need to. 

Also just wanted to say thank you to everyone here, even as a lurker just having all this info here and hearing about other people's experiences that I can relate to makes all the difference in a very confusing time.

I was so goddamn nervous, idk why, I guess I just didn't want any one questioning me. And my purpose was to go out to buy guy clothes to wear. I've never owned any guy jeans at all.

So I went to get fast food before and I could tell the girl helping me wasn't sure what to think. I tried not to say much cuz my voice isn't very manly either.

Once at target I grabbed some pants and shirts and went towards the fitting rooms hoping no employees were out front, alas; there was a pregnant girl working there. I saw the girls rooms and didn't want to go in but then I didn't immediately see the guys and I thought they were in a different part of the store and I didn't want to ask cuz my voice and then she pointed me to the guys thank god (which was right next to me lol). Gave me some satisfaction that she pointed me there, and I had so much adrenaline flowing from the whole activity.
Anyway I tried on things like 5 times and decided on two jeans and a flanel. Now mind you I wasn't in guy mode but I was dressed so just for convenience's sake because I had time to shop tonight and I've been anxious to get clothes.

When I get the the checkout there's a women with two little girls in line in front of me. I set the clothes down and the girls immediately start telling me all about the toys they just got. The mom is flustered finding her money or something but she comes back and her daughter says something about ""I'm telling that guy about my toys"" and the mom says ""you mean that person"" and she starts having this long conversation with me about she doesn't want them to be rude and all that and she was very nice. Obviously I was in girl mode and not really passing any way so I don't blame her for realizing I'm a girl, but I didn't want to be called out really, like it was my first time going out. And she's telling her girls not to judge people by their haircut and all this and I didn't know how to say I'm not just a girl. Especially I didn't know how to explain it to the little girls, like the mom needs to explain stuff like that, and I just kinda wanted to get out of there at this point. Anyway it was interesting and now I have cool pants, maybe I'll be able to wear them out sometime soon.

It's like it never happened, for better and for worse.",AnsuzThurisaz,41,7,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/v9ljz/came_out_as_genderqueer_to_my_lesbian_mother_over/,"As the title implies, this is my story. Well, a part of it, at least. I'm insomniatic, but not so insomniatic that I'm going to drop a book on the reddits tonight. As said, I was raised in the LGBT community. Needless to say, this has shaped every ounce of my being into a more open-minded person in all directions.

My friends have always joked about how they expected me to be gay. Except replace friends with fucking everyone and replace joke with constant verbal and physical harassment throughout the entity of my childhood. You see, I was a faggot by proxy. It was always ""Is he going to be gay or not gay?"" It was never about ""Who is he going to grow up to be?"" It made me sick, but that's a LONG rant for another day.

Being forced into that box had me CONSTANTLY doubting my sexuality. Gods forbid I prove any of those abusive bastards right and be attracted to a boy, OH NO NEVER. I have finally come to terms with my attraction to -some- men, but it's mostly the guys that sit in the middle (think VERY andro/center). If I actually appreciated my own dick, I'd probably hop on one, but I have a hard enough time not being bored to death or reviled by my own parts. Again, a story for another day, but HEY I'M TRYING TO BUILD A FRAMEWORK HERE, BE PATIENT, okay?

*cough* So, over the years, I've always thought about the ebbs and flows of sexuality. My dead-set attraction to lesbians and tom-boys, I came to find out, wasn't because I was ""jealous"" or ""wanted what I couldn't have"" or ""programmed"" by my parents. I've genuinely been attracted to lesbians, like, full throttle ""OMG I WANT TO GET TO KNOW HER AND SNUGGLE"" kind of attraction. For years I've fought with that until a kind, queer-minded individual told me ""No, seriously. It's okay. You're a lesbian with a penis.""

It blew my mind. Homosexuality is A sexual orientation in a myriad. I might be physically a male, but I am homo-emotionally female. I'm also physically nothing near masculine. I've always been slim and slender and never put on muscle (nor did I EVER want to,) and this did nothing but fuel the ""FAGGOT!"" fires I had to deal with as a kid.

Then, I learn about what it is to be genderqueer. The term seemed to fit so well. I sat on it for a loooooong time and finally decided to come out to my friends. Bi never felt right because I dislike men so much I hate myself sometimes for it. I'm definitely not gay, but I'm not straight, either. I've always felt somewhere in the middle. ""Queer but not gay is."" how I used to say it (especially every time a boy wanted in my pants). Genderqueer not only SOUNDS better, but it feels RIGHT. 

The few that understood more or less reacted: ""Duh."" The few that didn't asked me to enlighten them. Some of my friends (gay/bi/straight) decided that I was just looking for attention and ""The whole genderqueer thing is just a fad."" I was crushed, but the label was good enough for me, it encompassed everything I had been FEELING but unable to put a name to for YEARS.

My mom, however, looked at me like I was speaking a different language.

""So, you want to be a tranny?""

No, mom, I don't. See, mom identifies as bi. She was with a woman for the first 23ish years of my life. I've only known her as a lesbian. When I was a kid, we went to pride fest every year. Eventually, tho, their participation in the LGBT community stopped. So, apart from having almost zero support for being ""gay by proxy"" and all of the discrimination that brought, my mom is also VERY behind the times on the minutia of sexuality and gender identity. I tried to explain to her more or less everything I've described above, and more. The conversation ended with her saying ""Well, I just don't understand."", yawning and then she went to bed.

We haven't talked about it since.

See, I was expecting... something. Maybe that's why it hurt. I didn't expect anger... what kind of hypocritical monster would she be. But I got nothing. No support. No concern, just complete disinterest.

So, why is this a problem? Why am I bothering to pour my heart out to a small sub-sub-reddit?

Well, I am deeply considering hormone therapy to bring myself closer to the middle of the gender spectrum. The term ""tranny"", when I think of it being applied to myself makes my stomach turn. I'm not wanting to change from one gender to another, I'm trying to find ME. Since mom seems to see things so black and white, I feel like it's going to be a hard sell and I might not get the love and support I was expecting. It's one thing to tell your mom you're gender non-conformist, it's another thing entirely to have to explain starting HRT without the intent of going ""tranny"".

My biggest fear is having to come out AGAIN. To everyone. Especially my partner who is biologically female, also genderqueer, recently came out as homo-emotional and said she LOVED me because she sees me as ME. I am pretty sure she would stick through HRT with me, but everything else is... scary. I've always been afraid to identify as a lesbian because I was afraid that the ""real"" lesbian community wouldn't take me seriously. I've felt for a long time like I'm just crazy, or have no place in the world, but it seems I might not be as alone or batshit as I thought I was.

Honestly, I don't know what I was trying to accomplish with this post. Call it an introduction, a lament and an open-hearted rant. I think I might actually be soon loosened from the cold grips of insomnia.

Two weeks ago he made a cake and wrote 'I am pansexual' on it.

As open minded, well rounded and liberal as I am, I hadn't heard those terms. I read the context clues and figured out what he meant. 

The first thing I did was affirm him that we love him because he is ours, not because he is our hetero son. We love him because he's funny, he's smart, kind, intelligent and so much more. His gender identity, his sexual orientation are non-issues for us. He's been a part of many conversations in our home where we have expressed our feelings about this topic. People are people. Sexuality is complicated. We understand that...even if both of us are cisgender and hetero. Intellectually, and emotionally, we understand that for many, many people it's just not this simple. 

He wants to take the summer to experiment a bit. Grow out his hair etc. Which we are totally okay with. Even if we don't know how to guide him...how to support him.

I've been a lurker on reddit for months. Finally registered recently. And this is one of my only posts. Having read through this sub all day today...I feel safe asking for your advice and perspective. 

I would love to hear your experiences coming out to your parents...what they did right, what they could have done better etc. 

I want to do right by my child. Several months back, I was reading another story in the news about a teen who came out as homosexual...his parents kicked him out, basically disowned him. He committed suicide. I remember crying and crying and saying out loud...even though I was alone...'Sometimes I wish I had a child like this. I know I would love them anyway. I know that I would do everything in my power to help them feel loved, accepted, cherished, and safe to be exactly who they are.' 

Fast forward a few months...and here I am. So far, it seems he's baby stepping. He shaved his arms and legs on Sunday. On Monday I hinted that I have a very nice, if older, dress that might fit him...if he wanted to try it out. His response was 'Cool. I might do that.' 

How can I help him figure this out? How can I support him? Where can I take him dressed as a girl, that he will be accepted? How do I thicken his skin so that what insensitive family members or well-meaning friends say, doesn't cut so deep? 

And how the hell do I find the strength to not fucking care what people think about my child? How do I let it go when someone judges him a freak? When someone I consider a friend or loved one says something asinine? How in the world do I handle that? I know I can be strong and walk away...but I don't ever want him to know that it hurts me when people hurt him. He's sensitive enough that he might revert to not exploring, or to repressing, if he thinks I'm hurting or suffering on his behalf. How do I be a rock for him? 

Aaah! As much as I thought I could do this...I'm totally spazzing out over here.

Hi!

My name is Jaybird and I am genderqueer.  Gender is really interesting to me and my partner and I enjoy making a social experiment out of it.  When we decided to have a baby, I had the feeling it was going to be quite an adventure, so I decided to create a comic about it.  

It's been going for almost a year now and I would really like to expand my audience.  I try to be informative and inclusive, even if it ends up being sardonic.  I'm not a professional artist or cartoonist, but I hope I can help people, answer questions, and provoke conversation while providing a place for catharsis when I'm not working my crappy retail job.

Please check out [Platypuss!](http://platypusscomic.tumblr.com/) If you'd like, you can read it chronologically [here](http://platypusscomic.tumblr.com/tagged/platypuss/chrono) as well. 

I welcome and encourage questions and hope my first post on Reddit wasn't too much of a fail.

I was on a short commuter flight between two nearby cities. There was a family with two kids around age 4 sitting nearby, and the kids were peeking around the seats at me for a while.

""Is it a boy or a girl?""

""I think it's a boy.""

""No, it's a girl!""

""Mom, is it a boy or a girl?""

""Shhhh! I don't know, stop being rude!""

The kids start crowding closer to my seat, and I say ""Why don't you flip a coin?""

The kids immediately hide, and I hear the mom say ""Shush! There, see? It's a girl. Now leave her alone!""

And the girl says ""No, but Mom, it's a BOY!"" and proceeds to argue the point for the rest of the flight.

I don't get clocked as anything but female very often, so even though I should probably feel gawked at, this was still pretty funny and validating for me.

I am going to a comic convention in October and we both have plans to dress as the opposite sex.

The box was from a present to my daughter from her grandmother, but I'm not going to deny that I want some of my own.  I know my neighbor was making a joke, but it felt really good inside for that moment before I realized it was a joke - the idea that others in my life could know this about me and be OK with it without me having to 'break the rules' and tell them was uplifting, even if it was a bit of fantasy.

Let me start out by saying that I'm female and use female pronouns. For the past three or four years I've been a little gender confused. I still strongly identify when people say woman or female. But I also identify when people say men or male. And when I'm alone, thinking about myself, it gets more complicated than that. If it makes any sense at all, I kind of feel like I kind of identify as an in-between sex. Like I'm inter-sexed (though I know that is strictly a biological term).

Well, a few months ago I came across the term genderqueer and thought ""that's perfect!"". I assumed the term was an encompassing term for anything outside the gender binary. And it felt liberating and genuine. 

However, I recently spoke to a semi-close friend of mine who once identified as Androgynous, but now identifies genderqueer. Ze said that one cannot be genderqueer unless they are androgynous. And since I'm feminine and female, I cannot possibly be genderqueer. Ze also seemed really angry and offended by me using it.

(super long)",comradeKatze,32,5,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/14vf9w/boys_dont_cry_a_realization_and_coming_out_story/,"“Boys Don’t Cry”, by the Cure-  that was one of the first hints. Identifying with it so fully.  I had known the feeling far longer than the word for it.  I remember my “boy days”-  days when I looked down and was revolted at  what I saw.  Days when I put on the bra that made me look the flattest, a loose shirt and hand-me-downs from my male friends.  Days when I felt confused, depressed, and winced at words like “she” and “girl”.  But, I remember laying in bed in my singular pair of boxers, made from an old pair of plaid pajama bottoms that I had hemmed, listening to that song.  Smiling, as I started to dry my tears, then standing up to dance, as I knew that if I were to be a proper boy, the tears would have to stop.  Sometimes, forcibly choking them down without a smile to replace them, since the tears seemed to illegitimize my feelings.
	I started telling my friends, “I’m not really a girl”, when my differences were pointed out in conversation.  They smiled and nodded, not really knowing what it meant.  I don’t think I did either. 
There’s a venue in a not-so-safe part of town that my friends and I frequent.  Once, my friends were jumped by a group of gang-bangers outside of a Queers show.  It was an 11-on-3 fight that they only escaped with the help of a bystander and a bouncer.  I was inside, nursing a hurt leg-  the mosh pit had not been kind to my bad knee, and I had to pop it back into place.  I didn’t know what had happened until I saw S.’s girlfriend, Co.,  with tears streaming down her face.  C., with a bit of blood on his cheek, told me that we had to leave, immediately.  We snuck back to his car and sped out of that neighborhood.  Everyone was frightened, but no one but Co. cried.  While driving home, and towards the hospital, they told what had happened.  The gang bangers had been harassing Co., and the boys called them out on it.  They kept going outside to see if they were lingering.  Their tough act did them no favors, though.  Fighting did no good, and it seemed that they had only barely gotten away.  
	As we approach our own neighborhood, S. looked at me, and asked if I needed to go home through the bloody paper towel that was stuck to his split lip.  He knew that my knee was hurt, and I needed some painkillers and rest.  I told him that he needed the hospital more, and that my knee could wait a few hours.  He insisted that he would be fine, and I was driven home first.  
	After that incident, C. became determined to learn how to fight.  He wanted to take boxing, taekwondo, and get stronger.  He asked me if I could sew thin metal sheets to the inside of his leather jacket, for armor.  He needed to prove himself like a child who had fallen off of their first bike.  He had to prove that he was a man, not a failure.  
	S., on the other hand, was not on board for all of this.  I saw my friend, who used to hand me all of his valuables and run towards a fight with a lighter in his fist, shrink away from confrontation for the first time in my memory.  He said that he knew he had been wrong before- being able to punch someone says nothing about your real strength, and no petty argument was worth paying for with your health or life. Three weeks later, he and his girlfriend went back to the venue, with no problems.  
	Months ago, I sat in the passenger’s seat of S.’s car, upset, but having a hard time choking the words out.  My friend had died a few days earlier, and I was taking it hard.  I had tried to see S. before that night, but he had been busy.   As I told him, he drove silently, dragging on a cigarette and looking straight ahead.  He asked me why I had waited to tell him if it had been bothering me for so long.  I brushed it off, joking that he had had better things to do, while a lump in my throat rose up to become water in my eyes. He said “Some things are more important;  there’s always time for friends.”  I told him about the guilt I felt over it, the distress, the disbelief that I could let this feeling envelope me so fully.  He responded his “What’s wrong with caring?  What’s wrong with feeling bad?”  I told him that I couldn’t see anything wrong with either of those, that I always tried to feel whatever I was going to feel and deal with it from there.   
S. told me about the last time he had cried since childhood.  It was a couple years ago, and he probably wouldn’t like me to tell you the circumstances behind it.  That aside,  he said that everyone mourns in different ways, and no way is the wrong way.  That it was okay to be sad about something, and it was okay to cry. 

A few nights ago, I was driving around with N., who is somewhere in between being my friend and my lover.  A lot of my life takes place in the passenger seat of other people’s cars. Earlier that day, I had sent him an article on masculinity, and how men are pressured to disguise their emotions. 
 I should preface this by saying that Nate has lots of feelings. On average, I deal with a crying N. twice a week. Once, as we lay in bed next to each other, just talking, a switch flipped, and out came the tears.  That particular night, he started disparaging himself, saying “Look at me.  Fuckin’ cry baby.” I smiled, and wiped his cheek.  “Well, that’s all bullshit, anyways.  Gender roles, right?”, he said, laughing through tears.  
While discussing the article, he told me that he didn’t feel manly when he cried, and that he always expects me to be annoyed with him because of it.  To find him unattractive or weak.  I told him that I didn’t mind. It didn’t affect me like that, no really, it didn’t.  He said that being manly, in his mind, was being in control of your emotions, and being responsible- a leader.  It seems to me that he just described an adult, not a man, specifically.  After a few minutes of riding along,  a song came up on the mixed CD I had made him almost half a year ago.  It was “Boys Don’t Cry”;  I turned it up, and silently chuckled at the coincidence.  
	Today, S. and I sat outside on the back staircase that leads to the apartments above the studio we work at.  We smoked our cigarettes, making a game out of writing on each other’s pants with the ashes.  We tried to make plans for what to do tonight.  He joked,  “I feel like staying in, drinking a bottle of wine, and crying all night.  I haven’t had a good night like that in a while.”  We laughed, and I said “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you cry.”  He told me, once again, that he hadn’t in a very long time.  But, this time he added, “I don’t really feel the need to weep.  It doesn’t change anything or make me feel any better.”  I paused for a minute, “I suppose it’s okay not to cry if you never feel like it.  The problem is when you want to cry and you can’t.”  After a minute, we carried on our conversation, then strolled back inside to work. 
	Towards the end of November, I finally told my friends the word to describe people like me- genderqueer.  They listened and tried to understand.  S. called me “a perfect gentleman” earlier on when I refused to tell the details of a past fling I had had with a girl we both knew.  They try to understand, but I’m not sure they really do.  I’m not sure I really do.  
	The truth is, the world taught me what sort of girl it thought I should be.  Experience taught me what sort of girl I am. I’ll probably never tell them this, but I wonder if my friends know that they’re the ones who taught me how to be a man.

I'm 21 years old.

When I was about seven or eight, I was in my parents car and we were on a road trip. For the following three or four hours, I had begun to experience the desire to imagine myself as a girl.  

This wasn't the first time this happened.  

One of my earliest memories is playing with my mom's wedding bouquet and pretending to be the bride at the wedding.  

And when I played with a cousin of mine, she wanted to be a princess in our make-believe games, but I too, wanted to be a princess.  
I had these adventure games with a friend, and I would often play a female character.  
I made my mom buy me a barbie when I was six.  

But what I wanted more than anything, was to wear that dress. The wedding dress, and to be a lady. Being called a girl always aroused me. In video games, I always played a girl if I could. I loved it when NPC would call me ""she"" or ""miss"" or ""milady"".  
I never liked conflict, and I would often shy away from it. I never liked fighting, and I only found it acceptable if it was a means to an end.  

I started crossdressing when I was fourteen or so. It started out just with bras and panties, but it quickly escalated to trying on all the clothes my mom had while nobody was home.  

I loved it.

I always wanted to be a girl. But I always found myself attracted to girls. I mean, I'm romantically attracted to girls, but sexually, I only want to do boys.  
I was always really submissive in my dreams as a lady.  
In my imagination, I thought I should serve a man, and if I did, I would be a good girl.  
I've been attracted to men, but my physical attraction to girls seems greater, or easier. I mean, I like girls. But not really in a sexual way that I like guys. I feel, however, that a guy could ask me out, and I would say yes even if I didn't think too much of him, so long as I thought he'd be a decent man.  

When I imagine myself with a man, I hate having a penis. I hate having male genitalia. I want to be a girl to him. I want to be a girl to me.  

My interests are a little boyish. I like sports and video games and computer stuff, but I want to be an artist for the rest of my life, even if I go to college for otherwise.  

I do my best to be androgynous in most of the things I do. I hate having to identify myself as a guy. I wish I could at least have no gender. Maybe that would feel fair.  
  
I keep day dreaming of being 'his' girlfriend.  

But I want to be a girl.  

I just ordered a set of bras and a wig off of ebay.  
I still live with my parents, but I plan on moving out into a big city next September.  
I'm nervous about these desires.  
Am I too late to become a girl?
Should I? I mean, would it actually make me happier?   
I mean... I'm not horribly depressed or anything. I'm not overtly dissatisfied with my life.  
I fear hurting my parents and the people who know me.

But I mean it in the sense that I don't really identify with the concept of gender. I think I'd see the world the same regardless of whether or not I have what sexual organs I have.

That said, I present as my born sex, and am perfectly fine calling myself a girl, with others calling me a girl, dressing feminine, etc. But really, I don't identify with the concept of ""being a woman"" because, in my mind, I'm just a *person*; the core of what I am is in my brain, not the external bits I didn't have control over. I may dress feminine and wear makeup and enjoy doing it, but that's because that's what suits me aesthetically, and a lot of it is cultural, too, as this feminine thing is a pretty recent development for me. I feel like if I'd been born a dude, I'd probably be fine calling myself a dude and dressing masculine and enjoy doing that, too, but I'd still feel more like a brain than a gender. I don't gender my interests or activities. They're just what I like. I don't even really like terms like 'masculine' or 'feminine' for activities or interests or personalities or anything other than the physical, preferring instead terms like 'active' or 'passive.' I have trouble seeing people as 'a man' or 'a woman,' and just see them as.. well, people. 

If I could switch gender at will, I'd do it, provided I didn't have to stick to one. I think one body's handy for some purposes and experiences, and the other body's handy for others; I guess I just like the idea of experimenting with different perspectives. I don't feel attached to any one particular way of being.

Does anyone else feel like this? What is this? Is this what it is to be agender? Or am I bigender? Or androgynous? Do I have some kind of dissociation thing going on? Or am I just a girl? Is this how most (cis) people feel? Like a brain controlling some kind of biomecha? 

..Sounds a little weird now that I've written it down. I don't normally really think about it.

EDIT: And while I'm at it, I might as well go full weird on you - does anyone else find themselves looking at people and wondering how gender dynamics would work if, all of the sudden, we all had the same body, voice, and expressed body language (but the same internal gender/memories/etc.)? Sometimes I think people get so distracted by the exterior and attach themselves to it, when if you really listen to the message, each gender is basically saying and/or feeling the same thing, and it's the fact that we're so easily put off by external perception we end up with some pretty bizarre assumptions about what gender is.

..still don't know if any of that made any sense, but fuck it. Maybe someone else out there 'gets it.' Thoughts?

I'm not even sure if I'm in the right place.  This story may end up being a little long, but bear with me.  I was never ""one of the guys"" when I was growing up.  I was always pretty big for my age, and much stronger than the average kid, but when they stuck me on the football team I ended up getting run over more often than not.  I just didn't have the aggression for it I suppose.  I'd always been more of a writer than anything else, so I stuck with what I knew, left the team, and continued writing and making short films throughout high school.  My relatives wrung their hands and blessed my little misguided heart (I'm a southerner, for reference) because a boy my size really should be playing football, not hanging out with those girls in the literature club.  That sort of thing would turn me gay, they insisted to my mom, but luckily she let me continue to do what I always had.  I had a couple of relationships during this time, but nothing ever really panned out and I ended up leaving the dating scene for the better part of a decade.  It was during this time that I really started questioning my own sexuality.  I kept falling for tomboyish girls, who more often than not ended up being lesbians (go figure).  My lack of success in this realm eventually led me to accept my fate as that really atypical dude who'd always be single.  I'd experienced attraction to some guys as well, but I kept that under my hat, as that's not the sort of thing that gets discussed over the post-church Sunday dinner in these parts.

Fast forward a few years, and I'm coming up on graduation at MTSU  (I entered college late, so at this point I was 27).  I was still single, the long bout of relationships seemingly torpedoed by my own oddity having continued unabated, but one night I met the most wonderful person in existence.  She was short, dark skinned, short hair, and  her ears were gauged.  She was wearing a button down shirt and a black tie, along with a pair of artfully shredded jeans (I still remember that night in a great deal of detail, even though it was nearly a year ago). 

The short version is that I fell for her then and there.  The long version however, is that I just assumed that it wouldn't work, and did my best to ignore the fact that I was falling for this beautiful person who had  suddenly entered my life, and after this had gone on for a couple of months, much to my surprise, *she* started pursuing *me*.

After we had dated for a few months, she dropped the ultimate bombshell on me while she was on her way home from out of town (she did it via text, because she had been afraid of how I might react).  She had gender identity issues, and most of the time was more comfortable in the role of a guy than that of a girl.

After a long pause, I responded that I had no problem at all with that, and after giving it some more thought, I added that I wasn't exactly the most masculine guy in the world anyway, and that was more at home taking care of kids, baking things, the sort of roles that society deems as stereotypically feminine.

So that brings me back to where I am now.  I'm not sure that I technically qualify as genderqueer.  My SO likes to bend a bit more than me appearance wise, and she is also pan.  As far as I go, well, she's perfectly my type, and although I'm bald and bearded, I'm still not the most masculine [looking](http://i.imgur.com/T9gFOQx.jpg) guy in the world.

Although our relationship is pretty unconventional by pretty much any standard, we're embracing each others weirdness with a gusto that most couples can only dream of.

I'm a twentysomething cisman who likes MAABs who express on the feminine-ish side of the spectrum. In transgender reddits and forums, people like me are criticized as fetishists and 'tranny chasers' and very real threats to the physical and emotional well-being of transwomen, and told to keep our harmful fantasies to ourselves. I know the hostility is intended to protect, but boy oh boy, does it ever make me feel like a dirty perv, resigned to lifelong loneliness, and that my attractions are unnatural consequences of internet porn. 

.

On the other hand, of course I don't want to hurt anyone: the reasoning (as I understand it) is  that many/most transwomen hate being pursued for their trans status because they identify absolutely as women. They have bravely fought terrible battles for the right to use the label of female. And a man pursuing them because, so says the man, they *aren't* quite female, but something else, tarnishes that hard-won status. 

.

I'm curious if the feeling is different in a space like this. **My question:** for feminine-expressing MAABs, or really, anyone here, what has your experience been with dating people who are attracted to your being genderqueer? Is it validating? Is it frustrating if their ideal partner and your ideal expression don't quite match, and they try to change you? I'm interested in anything you have to say.


(and please forgive and correct anything I've said that is unknowingly f**ked up, I do it often in queer spaces and appreciate the guidance)

It wasn't at all a surprise to him, as I've always been a fairly masculine woman who wears a lot of men's clothes, hangs out mostly with guys, and I didn't expect it to be, but I wanted to ""clear the air"".

However, I confirmed some of my fears - while he's not going to break up with me over this, it isn't something he's particularly happy about, and it has bothered him for a long time.  Ironically, I've become *more* feminine since we've been dating (for him), but apparently, he's still not happy with it, because he still frequently says ""I know it's not the way you are, but I wish you were more feminine.""

Every time he says that, it's like he's stabbing me in the gut, but when I tell him how much that hurts me, he says ""well, it's how I feel"".

I don't want to invalidate his feelings, but I also wish he understood how pointless it is to tell me who he wishes I was, and how painful that is to hear.  I also would love to figure out a way to discuss what it means to me to be genderqueer and to educate him without making him really uncomfortable (he isn't a bigot, but has never been all that exposed to GSM folks all that much).

tl;dr version:

*Recently came to accept that I am genderqueer. I am bio-male but am currently in a female phase

*just bought my first set of women's clothes which feel amazing

*struggling with trying to leave the house because I'm too scared to leave the house in drag but I feel like I'm not myself without them.

*Don't have a lot of people I can talk to about this stuff so I thought I'd introduce myself.

I'm biologically male but throughout my life I've never quite fit in anywhere with respect to gender. I have a number of masculine traits and characteristics but also a strong set of feminine traits. They've always shifted around periodically. I've always had a hard time socially too. I (wanted) to fit in with both boys and girls. Whenever I'd play 'house' I always wanted to be the mommy. My entire life I've had much stronger friendships with girls than with guys. I often consider myself ""one of the girls.""

Throughout my life I'd have periods where I directly questioned my gender (had a brief period at 15 when I thought I might be trans) and sexuality, but sort of settled on male when I was 17. I've been pretty depressed recently so I've been spending a lot of time at home thinking. I've been feeling purposeless and unfulfilled. Like there are pieces of me that have been missing. More and more I've been giving fewer fucks about what people think of me and trusting myself more and giving myself permission to embrace my true self.

Actually, the big turn came with music. I want to be a musicologist but people throughout my entire life have discouraged me from trying to pursue music professionally. I realized that my hunger for music is so great that I could not possibly do anything else.

Maybe a week later I started to think about my gender a lot more. For the last 1-2 weeks all day every day I keep thinking things like ""I wish I were a woman"" or simply ""I am a woman."" and other things of the sort. When watching porn I started to identify more and more with the female instead of the male actors. I've had moments before and there are have plenty of times when I was more effeminate than others, but this time its different. This is the first time in my life that I've so fully shifted into a female phase.

A couple days ago I was in therapy when it finally dawned on me that I am not a man that has feminine traits, but that my deepest inner soul is androgynous and my gender expression is vast and varied. It was one of the most liberating moments of my life. It actually brought a tear to my eye as this huge weight was just lifted off my shoulders that I never even knew was there.

I went out dancing with a guy on Friday and for the first time in my life I got to dance how I wanted to. I got to dance in a way that gave me the stylistic freedom to more genuinely express myself and that made me feel sexy. I got to be a girl. When I was out on the floor I was just so... elated. It was this deep, warm happiness that felt like the pure happiness we feel as young children. Before the world has really had a chance to make an impact on us and we experience things naturally and uninhibited. It was like that, just pure ecstasy.

I hate dancing as a guy. Partly because I want to be girly and roll my hips but mostly because I'm so scared of how people will treat me. On an individual level, I don't really care what any given person thinks of me, but it's much harder to get around how people treat you. It makes me sad how scared I feel. It makes me sad that there is that much threat in the world at all. I'm scared that people will think I'm weird and gross, I'm scared that people won't understand and they'll be scared of me. Being pansexual, I have to even worry about my reputation. I constantly fight against my tendency towards femininity because if I want to sleep with a woman then I have to be the kind of person they'd be attracted to (ie. mostly likely I'd need to present as male/masculine).

So, I decided today that enough was enough and that if being a girl is what makes me happy then I should stop sitting at home and just fantasizing about it and I should go live it! I want to brag for a minute because I'm really proud of myself. I originally wanted to go with someone because I was scared of going alone and being judged. but I said to hell with it and just went by myself, got my makeup done, and bought some clothes. For days when I've thought about going I was so scared but once I made up my mind to go there was just some powerful spiritual energy carrying me through. It was just so clear that this is what I needed that nothing else mattered.

As I was getting my makeup done and I as I started trying on clothes, I would literally start jumping with glee. It just feels so right to wear these clothes. So, here's my problem. I'm depressed and I spend a lot of time at home but I can't get any work done. I tend to do better when I'm out of the house, but I don't want to leave because it means I'll have to leave myself behind. I want to wear my new clothes out but I'm scared. It's a weird tension between wanting to be seen in these clothes but also not wanting to be seen.

It just makes me so sad that I (or anyone else) should have to go through this much angst over a fundamental part of my personality that doesn't hurt anyone. It makes me sad that I feel like I have to choose between being happy and being accepted.

I have a hard time telling people. A couple people have responded positively, but even that guy (who is gay and a gender studies minor) I went out with on Friday started trying to tell me that patriarchal, heteronormative conceptions of masculinity have had such a profound impact that I'm confusing opening up sexually with being queer-gendered (is there a better word to refer to non-standard gender identities as a group?). I tried explaining it to my cousin who seemed to freak out a little and clearly didn't understand. Honestly, I don't know think I'll ever tell my parents. hey don't disapprove of being queer in general, but I don't think they'd understand what my experience is or really believe that it's not just a phase or whatever.

Anyway, this is obviously a significant time in my life and flying blind and solo so I could really use some support and guidance.

When someone started spreading malicious rumours about me wanting to get a sex change, here's how I came out as intersex and genderqueer in one go.",frayjoker,27,4,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/141fq1/ive_been_wondering_whether_or_not_to_post_this/,"&gt;I was cleaning out the blog (I don't use it anymore) and came across this from a few years back. You don't hear a whole lot of coming out stories around here, because it's kind of a hard topic to come out on. This was terrifying to write, but the response was overwhelming.

&gt; People were inquisitive, welcoming, proud and happy for me. I didn't have contact with the person who started the rumors in the first place. But I did hear she ended up losing some sleep and friends over people sick of her bullshit. It was a pretty great start to the year.

If you're here, you probably followed the link from Facebook. Allow me to first welcome you to my rarely-updated personal blog. Not that there's really anything here worth reading. But given the limited nature of a Facebook status update, I felt I could speak at greater length and more candidly here.

Yes, I have chosen to change my name to Cody. Yes it is more masculine, but also note that it is a unisex name close in sound to my previous name. Still there's been a fair bit of misinformation flying around that I feel compelled to clear up, as a result of my sudden preference for my ""more masculine"" name.

Just let me set straight now that I'm not transsexual, I'm not looking to change sexes, and I'm certainly not interested in any kind of surgery. What I am, however, is Genderqueer. This is a completely different kind of beast to transsexualism. Where a transsexual is someone who's gender identity is opposite to their physical sex, causing a dysphoria, Genderqueer is an umbrella term that encompasses those who's gender sits outside the commonly accepted binary.

What does that all mean? I like to walk a line that's in between what people choose to define as male or female, mostly because I feel that it's truer to how I identify myself. You see, a few years back I was told I was born with a particularly curious intersex condition that has left me a genetic chimera. That is to say I have both male (XY) and female (XX) genetic material in me. I don't especially want to get into the specific details of that. But the short of it is I'm still the person you know and love, just I'm choosing to live more closely to the genetic quirks I feel have helped define me as a person. It's not something I'm trying to hide, and I don't want to be treated any differently for it, especially since it's taken so long for me to redefine myself as something I can be proud of.

So I guess what I'm saying is, allow me to reintroduce myself now that I'm officially out of the proverbial closet that I seemed to have been stuck in for a while now. I'm Cody, still much like the [FRAY GIRL] you knew, just a happier individual looking to be proud of what she is. What I am is a genetically quirky genderqueer, not looking to make excuses for the things that make me happy. If people want to ask questions you can do so here, or on facebook, or email me at [POPULAR EMAIL SERVICE]. Honestly ask me anything, because I'm the kind of person who thinks that curiosity should be rewarded. If I can help you to better understand things, then it's a good outcome for both of us.

I guess I should make it my new years resolution to be more open about all of this. Unfortunately the misinformation can be quite damaging, making this kind of topic difficult, so it does make a world of difference to me that you clicked a link and took the time to understand me. So thank-you for obliging me and reading this verbose blog entry.

I hope 2010 finds you as well as it has me.

A place defined by many smaller towns, where normal is expected of everybody and shyness and demurity have no place, especially of all in men.

I have been, mostly, the picture of hetero male for most of my life. It was only when I came to be bisexual in my twenties that I stopped being afraid of not being that preconceived notion of the hetero male. I embraced my love of dance, song, fashion and romance for the first time in my life. I didn't worry so much about being a stone facade of strength, and learned to appreciate the strength of grace. I learned that I could be soft, that I could be sexy. I learned what it felt like to let a strong and gentle man put his arms around me. I feel good wearing tight clothing that flatter you in just that certain. Of course I am missing some anatomical importance, but I've learned that boys have liked me because in some ways I am feminine.

I don't want to be a girl though. I am happy being a boy. I just...I am happy being what I think a boy can also be. I just find it very difficult, most of the time, to be myself because of that disparity between the behavior everyone expects of you and what I feel happy being like. I've only been able to be myself around a handful of people.

It's hard to explain to others that intangible feeling you get when you're around people that have expectations of you. It's like this unseen eye judging you. Like seeing a dour expression behind peoples' eyes. Like seeing their real face. It's...scary. I don't like seeing that side of people. Or at least...those kinds of people who look at you like that.

I deeply miss the one boy who, seeing behind his eyes, seeing his real face, would make me feel special. Like, a mixture of happy and lust and the beginnings of real love. I felt like, with him, I could be like a girl, but still be a boy. And I think for that one weekend he did love me.

I'm sorry...I'm just feeling very sad and lonely today. Because of other things in my life I don't have anyone to talk to about these kinds of things.

Is that weird?,Chattonne,28,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1cy50q/new_here_hi_i_dont_really_have_a_gender_identity/,"I've been lurking here for a bit. I guess this is by way of being an intro post. Hi!

So, I don't really have a gender identity. I'm bio female, and everyone I know treats me like a female (using female pronouns, etc), and I'm fine with that. Most of the time I don't really ""feel"" like a girl though. The way I think, behave, etc has always been decidedly non-feminine. Like a tomboy phase I never grew out of.

Sometimes I like dressing up all girly, and/or wearing clothes that accentuate my female figure. It makes me feel sexy. My every-day clothes, though are fairly gender-neutral. I don't wear makeup, even when I'm being girly. 

Being bio-female, and having other people assume I'm female, doesn't bother me. I've never felt ""trapped"" in the wrong body. But if I got cursed by a witch or something and woke up a man, I'd be fine with that too. I'd probably still dress up all girly sometimes though. :) 

For a while when I was younger I thought I might be trans, because I knew I didn't feel like a girl. But then I met some trans folks who talked about how hard it was being in the wrong body. I've never felt that. And I don't really feel like I'm a boy either.

Sexually, I'm pansexual, so gender doesn't play a role in who I'm attracted to either. 

Most of the time I don't really think about it. But then I read an article or something on trans issues and I find myself dwelling on my gender identity (or lack thereof). It feels weird to be 34 years old and not really know what gender I want to be.

Anywho, just wanted to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading!

I have been ""sir""ed a lot at work the last few shifts, and it's felt great for the most part. But then the person will call attention to the fact they misgendered me, and that I'm female.

I was speaking with a friend and explaining how I wasn't sure if I was comfortable with being female. In high school I would wear more masculine clothing and aimed to be mistaken for male. As I graduated I got into a relationship and aimed to be more feminine. A few years went by and I've questioned my love for androgyny, and if I was confused about being female. On days I loved being more masculine, but I didn't hate my feminine traits either. My mother is old fashioned, and pushed being more feminine since she noticed I would dress in mens clothing; she often joked I should have been born male. I have constant pressure from her to dress/act more feminine. I didn't know how to describe teeter tottering between both genders, or if I was stuck in the wrong body. After a conversation with a close and new friend, he put it to my attention that I might be genderqueer. I looked into it and finally feel comfort in something I can put a name to. 

So here I am now, I recently came out to my friends as being genderqueer, and am slowly rebuilding my wardrobe to something I've always dreamed of. I still have some things to learn, and I'm grateful for all my support. 

I just have a quick appearance question though. My wardrobe is filled with more feminine clothing, and I want to aim to be more androgynous. I posted a link to a few pictures and am wondering if I could get some tips on posture/facial expression/body language and any comments on being more androgynous. Given I love dressing up on days, some days I want to just be neutral.

I've always been on the shy/sensitive side and dealt with social anxiety for a large portion of my life. I'm not sure where it comes from, but I think part of it is a defense mechanism to hide that sensitive side of me.

So lately I've just been more accepting of the possible transgender feelings, not repressing anything. For a large portion of my life I've been more masculine because I saw femininity as weakness. Well probably mostly because other guys get a lot of crap for not being particularly manly. 

Now I'm just trying to come to terms if this is more of a gender thing or if it's just my imagination. See I believe that some men have repressed feminine traits and the only way they feel comfortable letting them out is to crossdress or identify with being more female, as opposed to integrating it into their own masculinity. So that may be what I'm doing.

So right now I feel like a girl, but a man? It's like I'm completely comfortable in my body, I just feel strange. My mentality feels like it shifted and my perspective is changed. More feminine I guess. Now in the past stuff like this scared me and I'd push it down, which just caused a lot of trouble. So I feel like a lot of it is just repressed feelings coming to the surface and right now it's overpowering. I have a feeling it's going to normalize or shift. Or maybe it won't and this is really my true self. 

But like I said this could have nothing to do with gender. It's possible I confused masculine for cold, distant, independent and feminine for happy, friendly, and socialble. So there was a split in my personality almost. A lot of these changes are more internal, with a slight desire to crossdress and see myself as female. 

Right now I feel like I get it, but I think I've had this happen to me before and I switch back to a more male mindset. I'll have to see what happens. I don't want to force anything, I'd rather just let it unfold naturally.

I'm afraid to slide toward the middle. ,,27,5,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/rsd30/ive_been_struggling_to_be_a_man_for_so_long_im/,"I dont want to get too much into my past, my adolescence or anything... but for much of my life I've not been very male. As a teenager i was mistaken for a girl on more than one occasion (i *did* have long hair, and frankly... all my life I've had boobs :-/) 

For much of my adulthood I've embraced being male and maleness... toughness. I am a tough person (or so I am determined to be.) I had been picked on for much of my life, for either being fat, being smart or being emotional or having tits. I've countered this by being tough and holding myself up to a standard of indifference. I was never a jock or anything - or a d-bag - I guess I created a pretense of self-assuredness. I shut down and mothballed most of the parts of my brain that felt *odd*. 

And I paid for it. For much of my adult life I've dealt with frequent suicidal ideation, violent fantasies, violent dreams where I am killing, being killed or both. - very angry stuff. 

Well, I've [recently come out to my wife](http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/r7hym/my_wife_is_amazing/) about how I've felt my whole life. We've been together for most of our lives, since we were teens, and she knew about most of my emotional hardships. After being 100% honest with her and receiving her 100% encouragement... I feel finally happy. Maybe I'll hug my mother for the first time in about 20 years or something.

This is turning into something else... well, my point is:

I want to turn back the dial on my... tough-guy-ness. I guess I want to dress, act and generally present myself more like I feel and I feel male, typically, but often not *very* male or *completely* male, often quite female... and I know I'm gonna get my chops busted a bit for it. And I'm mad at myself for directing my life down a path where I'm gonna get my chops a busted a bit for it. 

And after writing this down I feel like it's going to be a lot less of a big deal :) I've certainly put up with worse shit than anything I can expect at work. 

Well, thanks for being here. And I wish my hairline never receded. (but what can you do?)

I'm a lady loving female in my 20's, tall thin, long hair and overall 'softly' feminine. Meaning, I don't do more makeup than some foundation for acne redness and I dress pretty tomboy-chic I guess you could say. So for all intents and purposes I am a 'woman' 

Except my mental image of myself for as long as I can remember has always been rather androgynous, neither male nor female in image but I guess my thoughts have always leaned towards a more masculine perception of myself. (if that makes sense) 

I love male fashion, while I've never purchased more than a sweater in the mens section, I always buy simple androgynous items from the women's section. Mostly because inside I'm dying to have the build to shop exclusively mens..but I don't want be a man?

I guess if I could get the muscles and more 'strong' frame but keep my lady bits, I would jump on that. But I don't want facial hair or a lower voice. 

I don't know I've considered doing a FtM but whenever I think about it a part of me knows I'm not entirely happy with either gender, so that's out of the question. I feel more like I rest somewhere in the middle.

SO tl;dr can I still be sort of femme outside and be genderqueer because of my mental perception of myself? sorry if that's a dumb question, I'm new to the whole idea but it seems to suit me...I think.

I have no one to talk to and I feel like I'm going to explode.,CatFiggy,27,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1f4ikg/may_i_just_barf_all_my_feelings_out_to_you/,"I just don't know and I'm kind of scared. You know?

I'm FAAB, always been kind of masculine. Mostly interested in women. For a while--after that period starting in middle school when I assumed I must've been straight--I identified as a butch mostly-lesbian (or a butch bisexual, but I have been leaning further for a while). But then, after learning about real transgender people on the internet, stuff has come flooding back. I've always been fascinated by transgender people, and where is my beard and what are *these*? 

I actually remember the *moment* I realized I was going to grow boobs. My (male, like all the others) friend brought it up, during grade school: ""What are you gonna do when you grow boobs?""

Horror. In my mind: ""Oh. My. God. I'm going to grow *boobs*. I mean--of course I am, how could I not have realized, but...no, please no. I don't want to. I can't. This isn't right. Am I going to have to call them breasts, too? Of course I will. And I'll have to be a *mom*. Please, God, anybody, no.""

I hate my body. Why am I so narrow and dainty? Why is my voice like this? This isn't what it's like in my head. My voice surprises me when I speak out loud. And where the heck is my beard? Aren't I supposed to be shaving by now? I want to shave. (Puberty was horrible. All the wrong things. Why did those people get to have the right things, and why did those other people get these things and like them? What's wrong with me?)

And of course the sexual stuff: I can't bear to imagine being the ""woman"" in these situations, but imagining being the ""man"", having the parts, is unimaginable relief, like wiggling out of a rope that has been cutting off circulation to my body for years. 

But I don't just want to be a *man*. I've cosied up to the idea of being a lesbian, and a butch one at that: I wear it on my sleeve, people see exactly what I am, and people like me (gay people, trans people, people who haven't had the standard straight, cisgender experience of sexuality) see me and recognize me. I know (if I recognize them) what it feels like, in part, to be them, and they know what it is like to be me. That thing when you were a kid? Oh my god me too! And all that shit that some ""normal"" people will throw at you many fewer of these people will throw at you. I do not have to explain myself to these people: They know already. And they *like* this part of me. I like the idea of being in the queer community and if I transition (and pass), while I might not lose being in the queer community, I will lose being there visibly. I will have to identify myself and even then I might not fit as well as some others.

I don't need to be read as a man, I just want the man's body. Does that make sense? I mean, even typing it that way feels weird--a man's body *is* my body. This thing is not my body, cannot be my body. (But this is what everybody sees when they look at me.) Ugh. 

I mean, there are some things that the world does when it reads me as female that I don't like--assuming that I'm interested in some ""girly"" things and not in some ""guy"" things, which it generally gets wrong, and other sex-related prejudices--but those things aren't about me being male or female in itself but about society's hangups. I could do without those. Without those, I might not not mind being read as female. However, I might not mind being read as male--might like being read as male--if I could also be read as gay or queer. (Also, how boring would it be to appear to the world to be a straight guy? That thought has me reeling. Just me leaving what I'm used to, though.)

Finding you people (not just the genderqueer people, but queers of all kinds) here on the internet has brought the light back into me. There are people like me and life doesn't have to be middle school. I don't want to leave that. 

So, I've been identifying as genderqueer for a while. I don't actually have my gender perfectly narrowed down, but I do know what body is the right body, and I do like the queer community. But I'm wondering if I'm basing my genderqueer identity not on my *gender* but on my desire to be more male than I am (from genuine instinct and dysphoria) minus my fear of actually transitioning, stemming from my reluctance to pull myself out of the queer community (which is less gender and more just lifestyle). I wonder if I should just be identifying as trans (like, binary trans). I don't know. 

Anyway. This has been rattling around in my head and threatening to poke a hole for a while. Thanks for listening, if you've gotten this far. ",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,trans,True,t3_1f4ikg,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1f4ikg/may_i_just_barf_all_my_feelings_out_to_you/,

I was essentially born female. Never really considered myself either male or female until puberty. Oddly enough it was not an issue within my family. I was the oldest or one of the oldest born on both sides and was never really forced into gender stereotypes as such. Everyone in my family seemed okay with giving me both of what is considered classic boy and girl toys, and my paternal grandmother made an effort of always giving me one of each because I always wanted some of each.

I know that if I felt I needed to sit my father down and express how I feel he would not be surprised. He has always talked about me as a boy and a girl in one... although his conservative turn of phrase is ""I have always said you were a third gender"".

I have often been torn between female and male... feeling like I should fit into one and I cannot fit into either. I have become comfortable enough with my female anatomy... but generally feel like a mix, sometimes more female and sometimes more male. 

I suppose the general expression that I really felt hit home was gender queer... and that was nice to see there are more people out there who feel like similar things. 

I did tell my husband off the bat. He is awesome and kind of looked at me, smiled and shrugged. His opinion is that he understands it is a big thing for me, but as far as he is concerned nothing has changed but the way I describe myself. I guess it is more about the vocalization than the way I act. The way I behave has not really changed... aside from me understanding that if I want to get a binder for some days, that is fine. (which my husband is also okay with)

To explain the situation I face:
I'm an MtF transsexual, I transitioned a few years ago. My dysphoria is rooted in not being female, and has little to do with my gender. My *gender identity* is genderqueer. I don't like the gender binary or its prescriptive roles or any of that. I don't want to get boxed in by gender. To some degree, I feel like I can't identify as transgender, because I don't exactly consider myself transgender, I'm transsexual. 

However, if I try to talk about it, I can't really use gender identity to refer to my desire to be female, because its not related to my gender, its related to my desired sex. But I can't call it Sexual Identity because no one knows wtf I'm talking about then and most of the time people think I'm referring to orientation. 

Its like, the way I want my body to be is that of a cisgendered female, which is completely detached from my gender identity. However, whenever I try to express this, I seem to end up grinding my teeth in frustration because people either equate biological sex and gender and don't understand the distinction, or in the case of some trans people, who do understand the distinction, think that I'm invalidating their gender identity somehow.

I feel like I'm treating on glass within my own community out of fear of offending someone, and just want to be able to have a conversation and talk about my experiences and feeling and thoughts and fears without someone thinking I'm attacking them. Not sure what to do.

I've been trying to look into it more, but I still can't tell if this is the most general thing ever, or a specific type of identity.  

In my head I've always considered myself a guy with tits.  I'm a lesbian, I have mostly male friends, I generally feel more comfortable around men, I prefer to wear men's clothing, and most of my mannerisms are on the masculine side.  Although I am biologically female, I've never really considered myself a woman, and I don't believe I ever will. However, I also don't feel the need to transition.  I don't want to be a man, I'm just a guy.  This all seemed perfectly normal to me and I never really thought to question it any further.

Then one day, I said something to a female friend, and she didn't follow where I was going at all.  I jokingly responded ""I guess it's just a guy thing"" and she told me that it couldn't be a ""guy thing"" because I'm not a guy.  I don't think I've ever felt so offended by any comment in all my life, but I couldn't really articulate why.  When I tried to explain how I felt, she asked me if I was trans.  I had never really thought that being a guy made me trans, because I don't want to become a man in a physical sense.  

After that, I did a lot of thinking about genders and how I identify and where I belong.

Said friends are getting married soon (I have a small social circle) and we ended up all going dress shopping for my partner. Shopping centres aren't a strong point for me as I can get panicky in crowds plus the usual dose of dysphoria of not being able to wear half the stuff I wanted, wasn't as bad as usual because I didn't have to hide my  enthusiasm for shopping or clothes.  

Half way around the groom who has been my best mate for something like 9 years came up to me and said he thought he was GQ too. He's always been feminine in how he holds him self and other mannerisms but I just figured that was him. We discussed it a bit as we went around, poked fun at each others fashion sense with our partners and ended up having a good laugh. 

Later that night we talked about it now playing Mario Kart, after going pretty in depth about a lot of things which normally go untalked about he broke down. 13 years of his life suddenly made sense and he realised he wasn't alone. 

He's still using male pronouns for now and isn't considering any form of transition, he was worried he'd have to do what I'm doing (had the initial GPs appointment btw) I just told him we're all different and handle it differently and he was happy with that.

My friend who is gay (and I almost dated) wasn't understanding where I was coming from. He is aware of trans* people in general, and is very supportive. But he was convinced that I was actually male, as opposed to having a male body and no gender identity.

I'm not sure if it is because he so thoroughly defies gender roles but still identifies as male, or if it is because gender identity in general is so flimsy that my rejecting it isn't a big deal, but he didn't seem to understand my perspective.

I don't understand what it means to ""be a man"". There are cultural things, which are irrelevant because anyone can defy those expectations or follow them regardless of gender. There are also things that have to do with biological sex, I have a male body, and I'm ok with it. But I don't identify as male.

So I'm not sure if he just doesn't get it, or if has similar ""identity"" (quotations because it isn't part of my identity) but still identifies male because he doesn't have anything else to identify as, or if every ""man"" feels the same and I am just one of the ones in a place to see it as an empty title.

This has brought on a lot of confusion as the years go by.

I remember very distinctly as a child, around 7 or 8 years old, turning to my mom before stepping into a bath and telling her I was a boy. She asked me if I was sure, and I said yes. She told me to look down at myself, at my body, and asked me again if I was sure. I felt terrible over it and for a long time felt really uncomfortable in my own skin. I'm only recently (In the last year or so) starting to feel okay about myself.

My mom comments often on how I'm the best of both worlds, tomboyish and girly all at once. Sometimes I lean more tomboyish, hand me down jeans from an older brother, sports bra and a t-shirt. Other days I feel pretty, slim jeans, scoop neck shirt and maybe a necklace or earrings. Sometimes I'm a boy and sometimes I'm a girl.

Early last year, in January just before my birthday, I cut my hair. I was trying to find out what made me feel right, what made me feel like how I feel inside. It was very short, and after I dropped the scissors I felt... I felt amazing. I felt strong and awesome. It was the first time I'd ever felt like I looked how I was supposed to. Before then my hair was always very long, at least to my lower back.

I walked downstairs and showed my mom. Cue the horrified look, the ""I'm so sorry"" as she assumed I had made some sort of a mistake. Every time somebody I knew looked at me it was always with shock and horror, and I felt like utter shit because of it. I'd finally felt okay with myself and I was getting put down because I didn't look girly anymore.

My best friend at the time would sneer at me and call me butch, would tell me I'd never attract guys with my hair so short (I actually attracted more guys, and was called 'hot' on more than one occasion, something that had never happened before). I've since stopped talking to her because she was a cruel mistress and poisoned my self esteem.

After my hair was cut, I would be mistaken for a boy often. It felt... right, it felt good. I never corrected anybody, I would just smile and feel good. Sometimes the people I was with would laugh afterwards, ""Did you hear that? They called you 'young man'! Hah!"" and I'd laugh with them because the joke was on them, I actually loved it!

My hair has since grown out and is now more medium length than anything. I haven't been mistaken as a guy in a while and that makes me feel kind of sad, I like being androgynous. I'd love to get my hair cut short again but have no idea what hair styles would suit my face, or which styles suit both males and females. 

I don't know what this makes me. If I'm genderqueer or something else. Maybe I just like crossdressing, I don't know. This is all very confusing. I guess I just wanted somewhere to talk about this stuff with other people, so thanks for listening to my ramblings.",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,,True,t3_wov2z,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/wov2z/feeling_confused_starting_to_explore_and_need/,

This is a throwaway. From the title, I'm sure you understand why I would want to remain anonymous. I started exploring some of my pansexual/transgender issues with my therapist today--started being the operative word. He suggested I should try to get more in touch with the trans* community, and I thought here might be a great place to start.

So I'm biologically male and have been wildly dissatisfied with it since I entered high school. There were signs of it all down the line; I've always been more interested in technology, mass media, and art (like any good 90s kid who grew up on the Internet) than typical ""male"" stuff. But thanks to my rigorously religious upbringing with my mom and (especially) stepdad, I was railroaded into being a good, straight, cis-gendered, God-fearing white Christian boy. Well, until I wasn't.

At 15, I would occasionally steal clothes from my stepsister. The one time I tried stealing her eye makeup, my mom came home early and damn near busted me in the act. Considering how close-minded my parents were (and me, by extension), I just decided to write it off as a shameful bit of curiosity and hope she never brought it up again. ""At least I'm still straight, right? God shouldn't hold this against me if I repent.""

Finding out I was at least bi came in a way I wasn't expecting. I was 17, lying in bed messing around with myself, and for some reason the thought of Zelda/Sheik, the gender-bending deuteragonist of Ocarina of Time, crossed my mind. Before long, I realized I was having my first gay sexual fantasy--and I liked it. Since I was still very much a True Believer (I'm talkin' bout young-earth creationist and denominational Christians are going to Hell for polluting the Gospel), I descended into a shame spiral that led me to believe, for about four years, that I could literally die at any moment by some tragedy or the Second Coming, whereupon I would be left screaming and on fire forever.

At 19, I quit going to church and tried to be more okay with being bisexual. That worked great until I dropped out of community college and had to move back in with my parents six months later. Suddenly, I was being dragged to church three times a week, which caused me a great deal of stress and emotional pain--to say nothing of how my faith began to erode as I witnessed the fear, loathing, and hypocrisy among the ranks there.

A little over a year later (20-21), I moved out on my own with my (hot, regrettably straight) best friend, got into my first serious (read: abusive) relationship with a girl (who manipulated me out of my virginity), and finally quit going to church for good. I actually worked up the courage to tell my evil ex that I was bisexual, wanted to try pegging--in other words, everything I was aware of at the time. She took it well, but she couldn't resist the occasional disparaging remark about ""One day you're gonna leave me for the personal trainer,"" which I resented.

After almost two years together (22-23), I managed to get out of that train wreck before I moved across the country with her (which was good) and got back into school. I told my best friend that I had a crush on him, and he said he was flattered but it wasn't happening. So there I was in a new town, with limited social skills and few friends, and I decided to throw myself at the craigslist meat grinder--which had the unintended consequences of making me feel like a cheap, worthless whore. Those awful two-night stands made me realize I really was kind of a girl when it came to sex--for better (fantastic lover) and for worse (getting attached).

24 was a rollercoaster. I dated a straight girl who wanted me to be more masculine, with whom I broke up (we also unsuccessfully tried again a year later) because of that and religious differences. I had a blind date that broke my God damn heart, which I still regret sometimes when I feel sad and alone. I started messing around with a girl I shouldn't have because I thought she understood me, moved to yet another town, fell into depression and started drinking a big bottle of cheap wine every night. I finally started getting professional help for everything that was going on at this point in my life, and it was an immense help.

25 was a kick in my love life's teeth. I have a lesbian soul sister whose newly-minted ex threw herself at me to make her jealous, and we didn't speak for months. Two girls I was in love with got married, and although I like their husbands, I started to feel the creep-up of old age and regret. After the second one, I had a really bad flashback to the abusive relationship and once again threw myself up on CL--this time, with a guy. It was, as I joke, the most disappointing four inches and four minutes of my entire life. I didn't doubt I was bisexual under more ideal circumstances--but this wasn't it. On a positive note, I found out I was really attracted to trans girls, and was quite happy to expand my repertoire.

26 was going great for a really long time. I came out as queer/questioning/fuckifino to my dad and stepmom, finally finished my degree in journalism, got accepted to grad school, and was learning about other permutations within the QUILTBAG spectrum that seemed to fit better than any explanation I had going at the time. And it was on that high note that I started dating my most recent ex, who was smart, kinky, and loved the fact that I was her little girlfriend or something like that (at least at the outset). Although she gave me a lot of room to explore who I was, the relationship itself was doomed. I finally pulled the plug at the end of May, after seven and a half months.

During that time up to basically now, I have been really messed up. Today was the first time I've seen my therapist in a very long time, and I had been trying to psych myself up to talk about it for a couple reasons:
(1) The aforementioned relationship, which gave me a little bit of freedom to explore my identity.
(2) One of my best friends, who I've known for almost a dozen years, has turned deeply religious (and bigoted) over the last year or two, and was firing off this seven-course meal of copypasta about the dread Homosexual Agenda. I composed a long, thought-out reply to it, which he promptly deleted from his Facebook wall. Our other best friend, the aforementioned roommate of mine, asked him why he was calling people out for repressing his freedom of speech while doing the same to others, and we both got defriended.
(3) I'm staying with my folks between leases right now, and one day my dad came home to find a mess in the kitchen, which set him off. I forget how it happened, but he told me ""You're almost 28 and I'm cleaning up after you. Do your part and quit being such a God damn girl about it,"" which made me angry enough to involuntarily react--slamming my hands down on the sink, making an awful racket because of the fork I was holding. For all the years I had to put up with my asshole stepdad telling me to ""man up"" or ""be a man,"" and considering my apple didn't roll far from his tree, the old man's sudden burst of anger and insensitivity sent me reeling. On the other hand, I'm now much more conscious of using any kind of bigoted slur, so there's that.

--
TL;DR: So the session was really positive. Most of this TL;DR is stuff he knows from earlier sessions. I told him that the hardest part--and the reason I'm here, posting with a fresh sockpuppet--is that I want to feel like I have some shared basis of common experience with other people so I don't have to feel so crazy because my identity is more than meets the eye.

I am a gender-non-conforming AFAB person. I have a feminine body and prefer mainly female and neutral clothing, while having a buzz cut and hairy pits and legs. I am not trying to look neutral; I AM neutral, so I pull from all over the spectrum and beyond and just do what makes sense to me.

I have good self-confidence and self-esteem. I don't mind when people make comments about my appearance. I know what I'm about. 

The problem is about sex. When I want to attract a person, especially a person with fairly normative appearance, I work myself into a little ball of insecurity and suddenly notice all the ways I am not normative. It is almost as though I think that normative-looking people will only find other normative-looking people attractive, which obviously isn't the case.

Eh. How does anyone overcome insecurity? I just keep reminding myself that previous partners have been satisfied, that I have been told I am attractive, blah blah blah. Took some nudes of myself just for a confidence-booster. I do experience some dysmorphia, and paying lots of attention to my body isn't always a helpful thing, but it seems to help in this case a bit.

I had a question though.. Is it a standard requirement that I get a pap smear before starting HRT? I'm 21, I've never had one, and I'm terrified. But I don't want this to come up later and and have it postpone starting HRT, especially since I will be out of state in late May.

It should be enough time to get the changes I want, and I won't have to worry about switching doctors as soon as I graduate and move.

I have a question concerning gender identity.

I have read in several places, when discussing trans* issues, that gender identity is a distinct thing from one’s gender role. That everybody has a gender identity that tells them what they are intuitively. They strongly feel like a man or like a woman. I don’t doubt that, and I know that this is very important to many people, but I’m confused about it.

I just can’t find that in myself. To me, gender identity has always been about the gender roles imposed by society. I can tell that, for example, I do not conform all too well to how men are traditionally “supposed” to be. So I certainly have an opinion on being a man based on that. But as I understand it, for most people, that is not all. They know that, for example, they are a man, even if they don’t agree with the traditional male gender role, and it is important to them. How does that work? Do you feel anything like that?

Saying “I am a man” feels weird to me. “I am a woman” feels even weirder, but that may just be because I’m physically male and was raised as a male. No matter how much I think about it or try to listen to my feelings, I just cannot find any intuitive feeling for it. I don’t know what “feeling like a man” or “feeling like a woman” really means beyond agreeing or disagreeing with the stereotypes associated with the genders. I feel no body dysphoria, but if I understand correctly that’s not really the criterion, either. Can you explain to me how, apart from external social attitudes, one can feel like a specific gender? Maybe somebody who is genderfluid and has felt both at different times could put this into words?",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,genderqueer-ainbow,True,t3_108alt,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/108alt/gender_roles_vs_gender_identity/,

I'm an extremely weird person by nature, and my ""gender identity"" shifts from the very femme to androgynous and even masculine seemingly at random. It's always how I've been, ever since I was very little - gender never made much sense to me, which is, I think, the only real nugget of wisdom my biological mother ever imparted on me.

Three and a half years ago I started medically transitioning. My body identity had always been primarily female, even with a fluid gender identity. Thankfully, my doctor had been exposed to enough of the downtown queer community to ""get it"" somewhat, and didn't mind that I wasn't a ""hardline"" trans woman, or that I dressed like a tomboy who didn't give a fuck. However, I was lost, and didn't know anything about anything, so she recommended me to a couple of trans groups. From there, I fell into a crowd of hardline trans women.

Big mistake.

At first they accepted me, and were even my friends. For a while, it was good. After a little while, though, the questions started coming out and they started asking me when I was going to get the surgery, why I wasn't dressing more femininely or wearing makeup, and so on. They warned me that my doctor may even strip my HRT away from me if I didn't ""smarten up"" and start being hardline right then and there. They told me being ""genderqueer"" is just what those 18 year old first-year college students taking Women's Studies do, and that it's just a fad/trend for them, and they'll NEVER understand what being a REAL transperson was. Hell, they even went after the people who used the term ""trans woman,"" because ""trans"" is a bad word that should be erased. 

They were extremely catty, and I'd even say abusive near the end. Unless I was going to go stealth, they didn't want to hear about it. Eventually, they betrayed me and hung me out to dry, but not before instilling a metric ton of internalized transphobia and queerphobia. For a while I was miserable. I wanted to present however I wanted, but I was TERRIFIED of my doctor revoking my HRT, or never qualifying for SRS since dressing like a tomboy wouldn't be considered ""full time,"" even though SRS was, originally, the last thing that was on my mind. At that point, I was feeling a lot of anxieties that weren't even mine. 

At Burning Man 2011, though, the few GQ people that I knew went completely naked... and nobody gave a fuck. In fact, some people came up to them and said their bravery was inspiring, knowing full well how society at large treats gender-variant people. Eventually, I went topless there, and stopped giving a fuck myself, and two and half years of emotional conditioning just kinda unravelled all at once.

So, at this point, I don't really care if I'm ""Trans Enough."" I also don't care if people consider me trendy - this is how I've felt for 14-15 years at this point, so fuck it. Is it even a trend anymore when it lasts a lifetime? I'm going to present however I like, dye my hair, not wear makeup, and use whatever pitch of voice feels comfortable for me at the time. I have more important things to do than constantly re-evaluate my gender presentation. 

I don't actually hate the trans women I used to hang out with. I know they have their problems, and that most of the vile crap they spewed at me was internalized transphobia as well. I just hope this story inspires anyone else who was in my situation to stop giving so much of a fuck, and do what feels right. :)",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,,True,t3_pkvnd,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/pkvnd/mtftgq_or_how_im_not_a_true_scotsman_and_i_dont/,

I remember one night in highschool having an epiphany that I must be gay, and then the next morning I felt completely different, and it's been like that ever since. I know I'm not gay now, I'm pretty comfortable saying that my sexuality is bisexual and that I'm mostly attracted to girls, but occasionally to guys as well. However, I've been trying to ignore the issues I have with my gender (and you can probably guess how that turns out...).

The past year has been me living as I always have and ignoring it, and then it all came flooding back in the past couple of weeks. So, I've decided to start checking out the lgbt scene where I live and try to find a therapist to talk to about all of this.

I feel more feminine at times, and I want to explore that more, and I started by ordering some clothes and dressing up for the first time. It was nice, but when I looked at myself in the mirror I couldn't help but feel out of place. I have to wonder if this is more of a sexual thing (it does get me off a little bit..) and not really who I am.

Really, I feel like I don't want to have to separate sides of myself. I don't want to dress up in private and be a guy in public. I want to blend the two fluidly, because that's what I feel like. Wear makeup, maybe some androgynous clothing, keep it subtle, maybe push it sometimes... but whenever I have gone out wearing eye liner and blush (about a year ago now) I felt so awkward and out of place. It doesn't help that my voice is very masculine, as is my way of talking, and I don't want to change that a huge amount.

I'm not sure if this is just normal hesitance or a sign that I'm acting out of some repressed urge and swinging so far the other direction that it's not really me either. I know I'm afraid, I've always been afraid to just be me and be looked down on, but I don't want to let that control me anymore. I just want to figure out who I am and be that person.

I told her that I didn't feel like ""male"" fit me (I'm AFAB) because I do sometimes feel female. She asked when I felt female? What things that I do or am make me feel that way? 

And I sat there wracking my brain because I seriously can't think of a single thing. I can think of things that I do that are *feminine*, but I'm not sure they feel *female* to me. And they are just things that I do, not some internal feeling of my gender. All I've been able to say about my gender to date is that I'm *not* female, but I'm not really sure how male I am. And it's totally possible that I'm just a femme dude.

I wonder if I've been hanging on to the idea of being partly female because it feels safer to me to be somewhere in the middle. At least then, I still have one foot in the camp I'm ""supposed"" to be in. And at least then I can be in that camp if I need to be for whatever reason.

I'd love to hear how other people answer this for themselves.

 I'm AFAB, in my twenties, and for about a year or so I've been struggling with gender issues. I'm comfortable admitting to myself that I am genderqueer and queer in more ways than that, as well. However, I do not look particularly androgynous. The few things I do to mess with gender expectations tend to make me frightened due to the negative attention I receive (for example, being called disgusting if I do not shave, being harassed in public, etc). Because of my relative lack of androgyny, I have had people imply that I ""cannot be genderqueer"", and it also means I feel terribly uncomfortable asking my friends to use different pronouns or a different name. Every time I try, I feel stupid for asking, and no one really follows through. 
I guess the one thing that keeps me going is that maybe someone out there who is also questioning gender confines will see me and realize that they are not alone. Most of the time, I'm just scared and sad and a little bit hurt.

Has anyone else successfully dealt with this sort of feeling? Do you have any tips on asserting yourself, or even coping with all these changes? Is there something in particular that keeps you waking up each morning, even when things are really difficult?

Basically, I'm a matryoshka doll of gender. I'm a FAAB androgyne who enjoys belly dancing and video games. I like binding while wearing frilly shirts and can only view myself sexually as a male. I don't mind if people think I'm a girl as long as my hypothetical partner is understanding that I am certainly not a woman.

I'm open to dating anyone (males, females, queer people, cis people, trans* people) as long as they are open and understanding of my gender identity.

I'm uncomfortable with OkCupid because they want me to pick a binary gender upfront. Am I male because I'm a guy at my core? Am I female because that's the suit I wear, in more ways than one?

I've tried meeting people at social events at the LGBT center. Most people view me as a girl. I went out with a very cute, compatible lesbian, but she confided in me that she finds dildos to be a total turn-off when, for me, they are my primary means of expressing my sexuality.

I've known I was different from everyone else since I was young, but I didn't know how. I grew up in a very conservative environment and being anything other than straight was looked at as wrong. When my mom and dad divorced over a year ago, my dad got a boyfriend and jokes were made all the time about him being a ""fag"" and a ""queerbag"".

It was only recently that I came out to my older sister as gay and genderqueer after struggling to accept myself for a long time. She said she was okay with it, but she calls me a fag and a queer. She also told me that when she visits Arizona for the summer, she probably won't be coming back. I'm happy because she isn't the best sister, but I'll be stuck with my mom and her fiance with no one in my family to talk to. They all disapprove of being gay, and they certainly wouldn't accept me for being genderqueer. To add to all of that, I moved from Arizona to a tiny town (1500 people) in another state last summer.

Thankfully, I made a group of friends who are incredibly accepting and only half of them are straight. They all know I'm gay, but none of them know I'm genderqueer. I'm planning on telling one of them tonight. Wish me luck :)

I began being called he-she when I was in 5th grade and the tormenting hasn't stopped since then. As I have gotten older I discovered the genderqueer community and have accepted that I don't fit the gender norm of female.

* A couple months ago I was enjoying a summer swimming session in a public pool(albeit in a senior community) when an older man commented to his companions, ""I wish that guy would wear the right swimsuit."" I knew he was talking about me because I glanced over and they were all looking at me. I proceeded to go about my business alternating swimming in the pool and reading a book on the pool deck. The man continued to leer at me and every time I entered the pool the women would shoo their children to the other side of where I was and ignored me. Thankfully, one Canadian who I had earlier become acquainted with did come to my defense but I did feel edgy during the ordeal. I wasn't going to let an old, judgement, leering man keep me from enjoying a beautiful day with a nice book.

I have a boyfriend who I met online; who knows about my genderqueer status and loves me for who I am. I know he cares deeply for me

* Most days I am okay with my appearance but other days I am not. My boyfriend and I went to the grocery store recently - I was dressed in a casual sundress and platform sandals - we temporarily separated to tackle the grocery list. I headed down an isle and passed a little boy who I noticed out of the corner of my eye staring at me. I later met up with my boyfriend and I heard the little boy - who was behind me - reach his mother and say ""That's a man."" As I went down another aisle, I saw a bunch of sunburned men pointing down the isle at me and laughing manically; since I was the only person in the whole aisle, I can only assume they were laughing at me. As we checked out, I went to the RedBox DVD rental kiosk and searched for a movie. A black lady and her daughter were behind me and the daughter (about 4 years old) proclaimed loudly, ""Mommy, why is that Man wearing a Dress?"" The woman appropriately told her daughter to be quiet and I went about my way. As my boyfriend and I headed to the car the same mother and daughter duo headed out as well. Apparently we had parked near one another, as I helped put groceries into the car I noticed the mother watching me carefully as she helped her child into the car. I glanced over at her and she stiffened. Her face was a combination of mortification, embarrassment, and fear. I had done nothing to her and I felt that my appearance alone had terrorized her. I was upset on the way home but I couldn't bear to answer my boyfriend's questions as to why, so I just replied, ""People are jerks.""

*I felt beautiful in the outfit that I wore to the grocery store but the three separate incidents made me feel awful. It's times like those that make me want to go speak to a plastic surgeon. I would rather look like an ugly woman than a man wearing a dress. I'm considering talking to a surgeon about FFS (facial feminization surgery).*

On the other hand, I enjoy being able to do things a lot of more preppy women wouldn't dare to do. I go hiking with my boyfriend and his parents often. I weight lift and keep my body fit because I'm not afraid to sweat. I work hard and do well in subjects some women would call male-dominated fields like math, physics, and science.

I'm a [born] male. But lately over the past couple months there's been something left to be desired. I don't want to be a woman and I don't experience gender dysphoria or anything...I just wish I could do what makes me happy; a gender fluidity or, maybe, neutrality? I want to be able to wear dresses and leggings and high heels, but not lose that option to dress masculine. As an asexual, I don't care about the idea of sex or anything. I find the entire idea of genetalia and a sex drive really burdensome and, when it comes to having male genetalia, particularly unnecessary and irritating.

As of the last couple weeks I started painting my nails. I hid it for the first week or so because of my family, but I got tired of that really fast. And while I'm still not comfortable to wear it around them, I do. My mom didn't understand and it made her uncomfortable. She passed it off as being worried about what other people would think, but I knew that to a degree it embarrassed her (especially when it came to her boyfriend). I'm too afraid to wear it infront of my dad and grandparents. I just know that the people in my life wouldn't understand what I wanted to do. The people here are conservative and rude. I got enough flack from dyeing my hair unnatural colours to know that.

Growing up, I've watched all of my friends mature and come into their own. Meanwhile, I was lost in a seemingly futile journey to self-discovery. 


Throughout my life, I've gone through a myriad of relationships with men, attempting to be ""normal"". I was desperate to comply with the stereotype. Becoming a mother at 18 broke my cycle of one-night stands and meaningless connections. I dedicated my life to caring for my daughter and decided that I needed to figure my shit out. I took a step back from everything and went through a period of self-reflection. A few months later I got my first real job, working for a prestigious communications company. 

Shortly after I started working, I met a girl. From the minute she walked into the room I knew she was different- confident yet not arrogant, stunningly beautiful, elegant, and graceful. She seemed to possess something that I wanted so badly, a calm comfort in the way she held herself. Over the next few weeks, we got to know each other. She was intelligent, witty, quite gay, and she had an uncanny ability to make me feel safe with her, something that was completely new to me.

I had always known I was a little bi-curious, but I had never explored it before. When I came out to her about my curiosity, nervous as all hell, she didn't hesitate to ask me out. Our first date was incredibly intimate; we instantly connected on a level that surpassed anything I had experienced before.

By far the most memorable moment of the night occurred half-way through dinner, when she casually came out to me as transgender. I was shocked because at the time I didn't know anything about trans* people and I had absolutely no idea that she wasn't cis. Fortunately, I'm not easily fazed and we still had a wonderful evening.

We've been together for seven months now. I came out to my family as gay for her (even though I'm pan... they are fairly black and white). My daughter calls her Myma (Mee-mah, mommy re-arranged). I've never been closer to anyone in my life. I've learned so much from her about self-exploration, being true to oneself, and about the LGBTQI community in general.

The one thing I value most about our relationship is our communication. We trust each other so deeply, and I've never felt safer with anyone. She's allowed me to open up and really delve down inside myself, and what I've found has left me with more questions than answers.

I now have the language to describe what I have always felt about myself. Though female bodied, I don't identify as a ""girl"", especially sexually... even though I do appreciate aspects of my femininity. Because my partner is exceptionally accepting I've been able to explore my more masculine side. I've started binding occasionally as well as packing. I feel like I've found something that I've been looking for my entire life. 

That said, I'm still having a hard time fully defining myself. While I'm not desperate for a label, I feel like I will eventually have to figure it out in order to progress and align my outward appearance with my inner self. 

I'm well aware that I'm not the only one with these feelings and questions. I'm left wondering where to go from here, and I welcome any thoughts, comments, and opinions. Thanks for listening!

For me, this is a feeling I experience most of the time, to varying degrees, because I'm genderfluid and not always 100% cisgender female within my female body.

It hurts. It's the feeling of being stifled. Of wanting to peel your flesh off and step out as your chosen sex. It's constant depression and anxiety. In some it's feeling suicidal because they feel mismatched. It's desperately wanting to ""pass"" as your current gender, to have people use the right pronouns and titles. It's a big black sticky mess of emotion that's so hard to put into words, because it isn't just any of that.

Another good way to describe dysphoria is the sensation of feeling like you're wearing too many layers. You've got socks on, plus a long sleeve, plus maybe a jacket and some long pants. you're not overheating, you just feel uncomfortable and suffocated and you want to take some of the clothes off. Now imagine you can't, or if you do, the clothes you put on instead are physically uncomfortable, but on such a smaller degree that you put up with it, or they look odd on you because they weren't made for your body shape - but you feel at least marginally better.",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,genderqueer-pan,True,t3_1ek1vx,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1ek1vx/how_i_explain_dysphoria_thoughts/,

I can see the village where I want to live.  Peaceful, happy dwellings scattered among the trees.  Though I've tried my best to make this prison my home, it never will be.  At best I can forget for just a few minutes that this tower is no place for me.  Even if I could manage to break out, there is a great river to cross and a long path.  The days will be long and the nights dark and full of terrors.  There is no guarantee that I will make it there alive.  Once I leave the castle I am banished forever.  Should the vilalge not accept me among them, I will be forced to live in the shadows of the trees.  Close enough to witness the life that should be mine, but never allowed to have it.  

I don't even know what emotion I feel.  I feel trapped, imprisoned in my body.  I don't even feel like it's my body.  It feels like I have it because there weren't any bodies left that fit me.  It's functional, but it doesn't sit right and I'm always aware of that fact.

I'm not frustrated or angry.  I mean, I've felt those things but it's something deeper.  It's this dull, persistent sadness.  I've gotten used to it, but I smoke myself into oblivion to forget for even just a moment that this is my life, this is what I have.

I the practical aspects of having a male body are annoying and upsetting, but the worst thing about it all is just the internal, basic feeling of not having the right body, not being able to be myself.  If I don't wear makeup and put a lot of effort into being feminine and cute I feel awful.  If I had the right body I wouldn't worry so much, but clothing and makeup is all I have.

I don't want to be a boy.  I'm -not- a boy.  I don't want to be trans, I just want to be a woman.  


I'm incredibly lucky in many respects.  My family is loving and supportive (I haven't told them yet, but I know it won't be a problem), my friends are really happy for me, and I live in a part of the country that's really accepting of this kind of thing.  I have good health insurance so it's likely that I'll have surgeries at least partially paid for.  I live in 2013 when there have been surgeries and a lot examples of people transitioning from male to female quite successfully.  And I'm grateful for all these things.


Thanks for letting me spill reddit, it's been a less than stellar week.

On the plus side, I gave myself a pedicure for the first time and it turned out really well.

I've been getting a huge boost lately from exploring outside the gender box I and everyone else assumed for me since birth based on what was between my legs.  There didn't seem to much of a downside to it, except for some stress of working things out with my spouse and the odd panic attack when I stopped myself from enjoying the things I'd been trying.

Last night I was at a meeting in an old mansion, and afterwards was waiting in their entry area for someone else to finish some after-meeting conversations.  I noticed my reflection in a mirror, and it just seemed wrong all of a sudden.  I turned away, and realized that the whole entry area was crazy with mirrors - every wall, not floor to ceiling but randomly placed everywhere you turned.  With every turn away from a mirror I turned right into another one, and it got worse and worse, the reflection just seemed to get more grotesque with each image.  I finally found a spot away from the reflections and stood there until I could leave, feeling very freaked out.

All that evening at home I found myself turning my eyes away from mirrors.  When I woke up and had to put in my contact lenses I was OK with my eye right against my reflection, but as I pulled back and saw my whole body I felt this strong reaction and almost ripped the mirror right off the wall.

Sudden, powerful visual gender dysphoria, when previously there'd never been anything stronger than gender 'meh'.  Just looking at my reflection as male actually hurts today, and there's this howling nastiness from the emotional pit I recently dragged myself out of that's calling to me and telling me that I've waited far too long and nothing I do will change it enough to matter.

Ye gods I hope this eases off a bit.

It'll be in our chatroom at https://www.icanhazchat.com/?room=genderqueer

Mic/Cam not required, but it might be fun to see your lovely/handsome/beautiful/cute/attractive face!

We are going to start at 8 PM EST on Friday, March 24. I will be on from 8 till 9, possibly longer.

The first bit is going to be a loosely moderated discussion. Our theme will be *identity*.

Who are you? Who are you becoming? What led you to your current state of self-awareness?

What are the words you use to describe yourself? Do the words vary depending on audience, place, time, or other factors?

Who is your 'my-your-me'? That's the person YOU think that OTHERS see you as. For example, I think people in certain situations may believe I am a butch lesbian. This is totally not in line with how I view myself, and may not be how others actually view me. Do your thoughts of how others may view you color how you present yourself? If so, how?

Is there a 'real you'? Could there be more than one, or none at all?

The Rules!

-You do not have to talk! You can just lurk, if you like.

-Whether or not you talk, please listen respectfully to others.

-You can use either cam, text chat, or both!

-All are invited! Queer, Cis, Questioning, Llamas, you name it!

-This chat is a safe space.

I was always having trouble identifying who I was as a person. I have had issues with my identity since I was 14 and began high school and possibly even before then as well when I was 11 (that's when the thoughts started to appear). I had always worn boy's clothes up until I was 14 (my parents were awesome and had no issues buying them for me). I had been made fun of a lot when I had turned 13, and when high school hit, I had enough of it so I decided to wear women's clothing (but a few sizes too big). 

Ever since the beginning of high school, I was questioning who I was. The women's clothes bothered me a lot. The summer before I started high school, I had gotten drunk at a beach party and ended up kissing one of my friends, and I had really enjoyed it, but was so confused. I had been called a lesbian throughout my entire high school career (even though I had a boyfriend for the first half of it), it was just a mess. 

Now, I am 21 going on 22 in the summer. I had come out as bisexual last Fall to everyone who was on my Facebook. A lot of people were supportive and didn't really get any negative feedback other than a few of my guy friends had made some rude ""joking"" comments about three sums etc. I was always still struggling with my identity even though coming out as bisexual helped a little. Gender-fluidity has truly given me the insight I needed to help identify who I am as a person and I have never been so happy. I truly feel that I am both genders on different days or sometimes both in one, and I am so happy that the way I feel about myself exists among others as well.



**~ Getting to the Point ~**

I just had some questions as to how to, well, go forward? I realize that I should just continuing being myself, but now that I feel comfortable with myself, I wanted to figure out ways in order to be more masculine since I have been hindering myself on the days that I do and it really sucks. I have longer, past-the-shoulders blonde hair (that I absolutely LOVE and would hate cutting) but I have seen suggestions like putting it under a hat or something to that effect. I rarely wear make up as it is. In terms of men's clothing, I would just wear shirts and then women's pants since I couldn't fit in the men's pants because I am too skinny. I'd just like some suggestions.

**TL;DR: I am a 21 year old, biological woman, and I have identified myself as gender-fluid today and it has made me feel comfortable with myself. I just want insight as to how I could get back into becoming more masculine as I had stopped dressing that way since I was 14 because of bullying and how to go forward as considering one's self as gender-fluid.**",,False,,t5_2r1c3,1368627107.0,,,True,t3_1edsbj,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1edsbj/i_have_finally_found_a_term_that_i_am_able_to/,

[x-post from LGBT],lemonchronicles,17,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/17er36/i_experience_gender_dysphoria_sometimes_advice/,"Okay, I'm going to try and keep this short, there's not much I can make sense of anyway.

I am biologically male, which is rather evident. Wide shoulders, somewhat masculine face, big frame etc. Sometimes this is fine, and I'll feel attractive, but other days it can completely tear me apart. I would much rather have a body that would allow me to change my gender expression at will, but any attempts to slightly feminise when I feel like it have resulted in scorn from my family.

I have also decided to change my name and title as a part of this, choosing unisex names and the title Mx. As much as I feel this is right for me, and my friends, co-workers and fellow students agree with me, my family are not feeling the same way. They feel it's too fast because I've only told them about my feelings recently. Any times I've tried to describe how much better I feel with my new name, I get laughter or accusations of being childish and selfish in return.

I'm not sure what I'm expecting in response to this post, though having more genderqueer or trans* people to talk to about this would surely help me out as even people I know who accept this, don't necessarily understand it.

My wife and I (m) are both a bit alternative, both bi, kinky, Burners, etc.  Just stating that to give a brief background, however we are also both mature, stable, responsible adults, we own our own home, she has a professional well paying job, I am an artist and a stay at home parent.  So we recently had our first and only kid (getting a vasectomy so it's for sure), and we are going to provide the best life possible and be the best parents possible.

My wife knows about my CD and is very supportive, I was actually in CD when we met, and she helps me pick out my CD outfits and do my makeup, etc.   I don't do CD 24/7, I consider myself gender queer and not trans, thus I don't want to be a woman or even look like a woman all the time, I am a person that likes having fun with his look, usually more on the effeminate, gay boy look or of course full CD or sissy look.  If anything, the look I like to have is very girly, girly boy look.

We both want to raise our child to be free thinking, open minded and non prejudicial, conformist or biased towards anything and this includes gender, gender stereotypes and clothing.  So if he wants to wear all blue and only overalls and jeans that is fine but if he wants to wear pink tutus and fairy wings with a tiara that is fine too, I won't push him either way or put my CD issues or beliefs on him, I just want him to know that he can dress and look however he wants and his parents will defend and support him in his choices.  Just as he can play rugby or dance ballet, it is up to him.

Now, I don't want this to sound selfish, but I don't think I should change my lifestyle in who I am at my core and get rid of my love and desire to CD and wear costumes, accessorize, wear jewelry and have girly or gay boy fashion sense, just so I can appear to be a""normal"" parent and so he won't be teased that his dad is a fag or whatever.  I hope that I can bring him up as an artist/costumer/burner/sculptor/etc, who will appreciate deviation from the norm and defend his dad's eccentricity and life choices.  In short, like most all parents, I hope to instill in him with what I see as the right values and morals.

Anyhow, the question and issue I want to pose to others is that right now our son is an infant and too small to understand, but as he grows older, assuming I don't decide to give up CD when around him and keep it to just private outings and parties, then he is going to see dad dressed up.  Thus I would love to know how other parents handle or plan to handle this situation.  How do you or did you intend to explain it, how did your child react, etc.  

Btw, in closing, I think it should be noted, as to me it makes a difference in respect to this situation, that I don't usually do the full CD with a wig and make up.  I do enjoy those things, but keep them more for parties.  My view on clothing actually is that all clothing is gender neutral and anyone should be able to wear anything they want.  Thus, when hanging around the house, I might slip into a tshirt and sweat pants or a skirt with leggings and a tshirt or jeans and a blouse, or jeans and a tshirt with pink panties underneath or any combination of anything.  Personally this is what I want my child to become used to and cool with, not with me looking like another gender or completely other person but rather just enjoying a wide variety and style of clothes.

Sorry for the length, but I have been wanting to ask this for a long time.

Like it says on the tin; this thread is for discussing things around the subreddit. I've been lurking through a lot of the drama unfolding over on r/lgbt, and one of the sensible suggestions that seems to keep popping up is that there should be a posted, open, and available set of rules to act as a set of guidelines for both the readers and the mod team. 

Right now, the mod team's just me, but we are still growing and we might need a new mod sometime soon. As it stands presently, we grow a little more every day and the workload isn't very heavy, so I figure I'll open applications for another mod when we hit a milestone like 1000 readers. I am, of course, open to feedback on this idea.

Rules! Yes, back to the bit about posting some standardized rules. At the moment, we've only had one person come here and post nasty, hurtful comments. Even so, I'm tempted to message them and strive to *teach* rather than to dismiss. More to the point, however, about rules. What should our rules be? These are rules that would cover everyone, so as readers you would be able to call me on it if I should happen to goof up somewhere, too. Personally, I do like to give people second chances, just in case, and I've been playing things by ear: If someone says something hurtful and I catch it, then I'll ask them to cool it, and if they continue then things will progress to a warning or even a ban. I do take a harder line on slurs; I feel that using slurs is reprehensible, but we're got an awesome community here, and fortunately that hasn't been an issue.

Also, flair! Flair is kinda fun, and I've always thought it looks neat. Right now we've got text-based flair, and I've been working on how to figure out image-based flair for a little while. I do very much like [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow)'s flag flair; it seems very sensible and professional. To be honest, though, I'm not exactly a fan of the genderqueer flag; I'll rally beneath it, but I just don't like the lavender and green combination. I need to ask the mods of [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow) how they got image-based flair up and running... and also, [/r/mylittlepony](/r/mylittlepony) had a utility running that would allow users to assign their own, custom flair at one point. All you needed was a tiny image to upload... I think that would be useful, because then everyone could pick whatever they feel suits them best, even though it would mean more work for me. Personally, I like the idea of creating a post asking for art from our community. That would allow us to have flair made by us, for us; I feel that would really encourage community participation and it would make things a little more welcoming and homely around here. I encourage this board as a welcoming space, and I feel it would encourage pride in our board. (Because people could say ""See that flair right there? *I* made that. How cool is that?"")

In summation:

1. Rules and guidelines: Let's work out some sensible rules together.

2. New Moderator: I'm planning on opening applications for another moderator when we get to 1,000 readers.

3. Flair: What sort of flair should we have? Should we go with [/r/ainbow](/r/ainbow)'s flag flair? Should we enable custom user-generated flair? (This may take a little longer for me to enable.) Should we issue a call for artists to produce brand new flair just for our subreddit here?

4. Old business: As always, I am open to suggestions and criticisms, if you have an excellent idea on how we can improve something, please message me and let me know!

Edit: Apparently I disabled text-based user flair while I was fiddling with the CSS to enable image-based flair.

Analogies work well for me, maybe this one will for you.  I found an article (source unknown) years ago about gifted students and today I suddenly found the assertion relevant to gender issues too:

Gifted students grow up in schools surrounded by peers who are intellectually or emotionally behind them.  It can be tough spending so much time with people when their interests seem so immature.  Furthermore, schoolwork becomes tedious and boring.  Teachers address this by claiming that it's your fault for being profoundly uninterested in kindergarten puzzles.  ""If you're so smart, you should be able to complete the schoolwork *and* understand how to make friends with your peers!""

They are correct - learning to do tedious tasks and make friends with relative duds is a good skill.  However, what our education system fails to understand is that there is a difference between *learning* how to do it and *living* with it.  Being forced to practice that ""lesson"" for 6 hours a day, day in and day out, for your *entire childhood* is nothing short of *torture*.  It's *abuse*.

The same applies to transgender issues.  You can, and already have, learned to play society's gender role.  And most transgendered people do it when they need to.  Living it, however, is something entirely different.  It is *torture* and it is wrong.

I keep remembering about when I was a child how I'd always dress like a boy, and have short hair, and do more boyish activities. I even once told my mom I wanted to 'be a boy' when I grew up... I was even jealous that boys could walk around without their shirt on. (I still am now actually :P )

I've been dressing more masculine as of late, just like I did when I was a kid, and it makes me feel so happy and at ease and comfortable to do so again. It makes me think that maybe binding my chest may help me feel even more comfortable in my own skin. It also makes my heart race at the thought that I may even be transgender.... Which leads me to more anxiety. I think about what would happen if I was? What if I came out and later on realized I didn't feel that way anymore? What if I'm just thinking too much on all this? Or what if my extended family just judges me? What will other people think? Will I be able to handle all this on my own, or should I get a gender therapist? Those are all things that keep rolling around my mind right now...

I don't really know if I am possibly transgender right now... I know I'm okay with being a woman, but my constant questioning has really gotten me to wonder, feel fearful, have a bit of anxiety, and to actually start thinking more in depth about my gender and who I really am.

So...I guess what this all comes down to is I'm at a loss, how can I get rid of all this fear eating away at me? Where do I even start? Should I get a therapist for all this? It's too soon for me to know if I even intend to transition considering I'm so hesitant on everything right now. I feel so frustrated and stressed with all my confusion and questioning. 

Also, where in the world can I find a good chest binder for a good price?

Around February of this year, in my last semester of Undergrad, I decided, ""Fuck it, Imma do what I want.""  I'm a biological male, 6'6"" and with a very masculine form, but I decided to start openly wearing makeup, nail polish and whatever clothes I wanted to.  For a solid three months I had a terrific experience expanding my own horizons and getting comfortable in my own skin and in my own ambiguous gender identity.  I learned in those months that there are such things as comfort, acceptance and love for people like us.  There is peace and community and normalcy, in some contexts, when you just decide to do it and let yourself be yourself.

It culminated in going to my spring formal in a dress and patterned stockings.  All of my friends were supportive, and it was perhaps the best night I've ever had.  They were all supportive, a few girls complimented me on my style choices, and on the whole the night was glorious.  A week later I wore makeup and nail polish at graduation, and later when I went out to dinner I kept the makeup and nail polish and wore capris with the same patterned stockings I wore to formal.  It felt great.  Here I was, out in public, looking genuinely good in a gender-ambiguous way, comfortable with myself.

(by the way, Roberts Wesleyan College in Rochester, NY, where I attended, was a loving, accepting community.  Somewhat surprising for its conservative theological base, but worth stating and commending here)

Anyway, I didn't get into grad school so I had to move down to Mississippi to live with my Mom and Step-Dad.  I don't have a job yet, and I can't seem to get one yet, so I can't move out onto my own yet.

I've tried even wearing makeup around them, but it seems like every time I do I'm met with disapproval, criticism and outright scorn.  I love my Mom more than anyone else in the world, but it seems like I can't do anything outside of accepted gender binary without her reminding me that my gender-ambiguous behavior is harmful to my employment prospects and my lifelong success potential.  I want to say that she's wrong, but living in Mississippi she's probably right.

I feel like I've gone from living life in an open field to living in a small room.  I already have the shock that I'm not in college anymore (I'm working on getting into ""normal"" grad school to become a teacher now) and on top of that I have to find a way to deal with the fact that I can't dress myself and present myself how I want to if I'm to expect any measure of normal employment and fulfillment, I have to keep myself confined to the binary.

I know how to ""just do it"", I know how to get over societal conceptions and hold my head high in stockings and a denim skirt.  That's not the issue.

I don't know how to stare down the person who loves me the most and tell her that she's wrong when I know she isn't.

I don't know how to stare down the harsh realities of employment in the deep south and still manage to be myself.

Staying in the closet, pretending, isn't an option after what I learned back in college, but at the same time I feel like the expression I crave is similarly no longer a viable option for pursuing the path of life that I want.

Can any of y'all give me advice on how to proceed or what to do?",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,,True,t3_1f46tc,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1f46tc/advice_on_life_anyone/,

Then in September I met a man, fell for him, and started to really question my identity. In October, I started to feel that I was transgendered (ftm). The identity crisis grew until I finally started feeling comfortable as male and my boyfriend and close friends were viewing me as male. It got to the point that I started therapy, came out to a family member and management at work, and talked to my doctor about referrals to endocrinologists.

There were always times that I second-guessed myself, but never like this - in the past few weeks my boyfriend moved out of my apartment and we sort of distanced ourselves and I have felt more and more feminine. To the point where I shaved my legs for the first time in months, changed the way I've been dressing ever so slightly, and I feel more comfortable in my own body. I still hate the idea of being oversexualized, objectified, or dehumanized as a female-bodied person, and I don't know to what extent I really feel female - but I feel more feminine than I have in months and am starting to miss my old ways.

I don't know if I'm genderqueer, genderfluid, or just really confused. It scares the crap out of me that I was so convinced I wanted top surgery and T injections and all that jazz - there are people calling me a male name and I'm embarrassed that I've even said anything to anyone. I almost feel like being with him made me feel like I needed to be masculine, somehow? I can't explain but it makes me feel crazy, like I was just trying desperately to have some kind of identity when I feel like I never really have.

I thought that if I ever told anyone about my own gender identity after my sister, they would write me off as someone who wanted to get into the spotlight after her transition.


So, I kept very quiet about the whole thing, after mentioning it to a very close friend about three years ago. Now that my sister's transition is actually happening and she is happier then ever, I've been considering telling her. It's been a very wild ride for her and has come with major depression and a whole lot of bad things for my family.

Now, whenever I write anything like ""16 Year Old, bisexual, Male"" the male part feels extremely weird. This has only happened since I figured out my gender identity, and I have no idea why. Is this some sort of Gender dysphoria (is that even the correct term?)?

I'm a male and for the past few days I've been wearing my wife's underwear.  It's made me feel radically better about myself and my life, but I can tell it's been bothering my wife, so I'd been trying to think of ways to compromise with her, make it easier for her.

I let my wife sleep in - she'd had a rough night, tossing and turning, so I just got a sleepy answer from her on what kind of coffee she wanted me to brew for her and went on with showering and cleaning up the kid's breakfast dishes.

I went back in the bedroom to get dressed, and she was still sleeping.  I gathered my clothes, and looked across the room to her dresser - the top drawer filled with soft, satiny, pretty underthings.  Then I looked at my top drawer in front of me, filled with fresh clean menswear like I'd been wearing, except this week, every day of my life for decades.  I picked up a pair of men's underwear, put it down again.  I looked over at my sleeping, loving, probably a little freaked-out-at-me wife.

I didn't feel right taking her things without asking, and there was something appealing about asking her for the pretty thing to wear.  Then this pleasant little voice said, 'You should try a day in your regular underwear.  You'll be OK, and you really should find out if you *want* to do this or if you *need* to.'

I pulled on a pair of men's briefs, and immediately felt a tightness in my head, my chest.  The little vocie said 'You're OK, you're just getting yourself worked up.'  I stood there, leaning on my dresser, taking deep breaths...then I pulled myself out of the room, like I was grabbing each muscle of my legs with a puppet string.

I made it two steps out the bedroom door before my knees went out from under me.  I was at the top of the stairs, felt like I could barely breath or think, this overwhelming feeling of disaster taking over my mind.

The voice came up again, encouraging me.  'You can do this.  You can work through it.  That underwear is only a symbol, you can feel happy and normal without it.  Your wife will like it that you're strong enough.'  On and on it went, pushing me forward.

I pulled myself up the wall and held on, trying to make myself go down stairs, and then I realized something.

That negative voice, the one that had been whispering to me for more years than I could remember, telling me that I was worthless and had made so many mistakes, told me that no one would care if I died, the voice that had gone miraculously silent the day I slipped on a pair of women's underwear...it had always called me 'you'.  *You* made mistakes, *you* wouldn't be missed, *you* could just step in front of that truck and it would be over.  The positive voice, the one that only started up yesterday, it always said ""I"" and ""Me"".  ""I"" am doing work that is important.  People love *me*.  *I* am going to be OK.

I grabbed yesterday's 'pretty panties' off the top of the laundry hamper in front of me - they were still nice enough, one of the happy little obsessions about this is being very careful not to spoil them when I'm wearing them - and ran downstairs with them, put them on, buried the men's underwear in the bottom of a downstairs laundry bin.

I tried to eat some breakfast, but was still feeling incredibly jangled, upset.  I wanted to wake my wife and talk to her about it but I wanted to calm down first, I didn't want to scare her.

As I walked to work I was apprehensive at first, but with every step my mood improved - the negative voice was still silent, the positive voice was slowly coming back up into my awareness.  I wasn't as giddy as I'd been the past couple of days, and I'm still a bit unnerved from the experience.

I'm hoping for some useful recommendations from the local physician I know of, since this experience has warned me that counseling is necessary sooner rather than later.  I'm not looking forward to talking this episode over with my wife, as I think one problem with our relationship is that she's needed me to be strong for her for so long that it scares her to think of me as having weakness.

I'm betting that I need to be very, very careful about the steps I take in whatever this is - because it looks like there are unexpected consequences to trying to go back.

**tl;dr:** I've been wearing women's underwear for a couple of days to generally positive feelings of self, tried wearing men's underwear and pretty much fell apart.

I am desperately trying to find a good community for me. I've been reading for a while here and this seems like such a welcoming and safe place.

I'm a FAAB andro, out as queer within the last year. I live in a VERY conservative area and presenting in a way that's comfortable to me has been scary.

I was just laying in bed before falling asleep and it just struck me that I don't feel like I'm a girl. But I definitely am not a boy. 

What I do know is that I've wanted to wear a binder for a long time. I think I drunkenly accidentally confessed this to a friend. I think. But there's a couple things preventing me from doing so. Mostly that I'm not sure how effective they'll be on me.

I already have a really flat chest. Like, hardly an A cup. This mixed with the fact I have a rather small frame anyways, I'm worried that a binder will do nothing for me. That it will just sit there and accomplish nothing. But even double-sports-bra-ing it isn't flattening me to a point I'd like (you know what I mean). I also tried pinning another layer of cloth to tighten it a bit and it didn't seem to accomplish anything. I would just really like to be able to wear a semi-form fitted guy's shirt without my 12-year old girl chest being visible (I'm 20, lol). Has anyone had this problem or have any recommendations?

ill describe myself first. white. biologically male. early thirties. most people register me as straight, but definitely not all. i exhibit tendencies i guess. i gravitate toward the envelope pushers in society. heavily tattooed people. subcultures of all kinds. anyone fighting for something. i tend to seek out gay males for friendships like a kid catching pokemon. i dont sleep with men but i sometimes find them attractive. 

the problem is that im only attracted to very-gay-leaning, gender-bending biological females. dont write me off just yet. *i see you reaching to click back.* this isnt a fetish. this is why im taking the time to reach out here. i have fantasies about other things. i dont type ""genderqueer"" into porn search engines. theres a difference between what gets me hard and what makes my stomach ache and my ears get hot. 

its been this way forever. i remember being a kid in the late eighties and this movie came on tv called ""Just One of the Guys"". its about a girl who dresses as a boy through highschool so she can enroll in a journalism program. i remember being fascinated with her. i hated the end of the movie **spoiler alert** when she went back to being ""girly"". i couldnt understand how anyone could think the dainty submissive soft-featured girl was somehow more appealing than the cocky square-jawed fearless rebel. 

anyway. i find most ""typical"" girl behavior extremely aggravating to be around. i cant stand the damsel in distress routine. i find perfume, makeup, and lingerie well... gross. i guess gross is the actual word. 

and then i see a skinny butch female. cocky. confident. wearing levis and a tie. swagger everywhere. ready to fight the world. and my heart dies a little because i think that fearlessness is for someone else. shes never going to fight the tide of society to stand bravely holding my hand. in fact she probably thinks my beard is disgusting. 

i dont know. what do you think reddit? am i confusing what i admire with what i love? does it even matter what the motivation behind it is? what about the obvious issues that would arise(mostly-gay-leaning remember) if i were to end up dating a person like this? does anyone else have a similar situation? 

also ive kind of accepted this is really what i am into and have stopped dating CIS (believe thats correct?) females about two years ago. so im also interested in peoples ideas on dealing with loneliness and living in an area where the general population doesnt give you many dating options.

So I've been identifying myself as bigender or dualgender for a while now, I'm biologically male, late twenties.  I was on /r/DualGender, which I hadn't gone to until a month or so ago, but I haunt /r/genderqueer all the time, and the DG people were mentioning 'phases' a lot.  Girl phase, guy phase.  This sort of makes sense to me but I personally hadn't heard of that or thought of it that way before.  

I just wanted to ask you all what you thought.  I feel pretty much like I'm both, pretty much all the time.  Man and Woman, all the time.  I always get jealous of the pretty girls with great figures, I always feel a little bummed that I don't have real breasts or a vagina, but I also always love my penis.  I always wish I could switch back and forth whenever I wanted.  Granted when I dress like a woman I feel more like a woman, so if anything that might be a phase.  But I sort of always feel like a man on the outside and a woman on the inside and also a woman on the outside and a man on the inside (depending on my presentation.)  Anyone else relate to this?  Is there a different term than bigender that I should look into?  I know that I'm just who I am at the end of the day, but I enjoy the community of knowing the ""right"" label.  

DualSpirit is how I feel.  Like my soul or what have you is male and female simultaneously.  I just wish it were possible to make my body able to switch back and forth as fluidly (as I know many of us do.)

One of the characters in an erotic novel I'm beginning is genderqueer and completely androgynous in appearance and presentation. In the context of the plot, this character is a god, a Trickster -- like Coyote, who was thought to be a ""two-spirited"" being with the ability to shift fluidly from one gender to the other or anywhere in between. In the realm of the gods, this character can be anything they please; in reality, they are female-bodied, with a mixture of femme and butch aspects all adding up to a totally androgynous look. 

The thing I want to ask your advice on is how to approach the pronouns I use for this character. Writing sex scenes while avoiding pronouns for one character is clunky and odd, so I need to know what pronouns *you* would like to see in a story.

Not for the sensitive, I suppose, but I could use some advice/support.

I'm a bisexual genderqueer female who has been in a committed relationship with a great guy for several years. I've always had a more traditionally male personality than most women, and over the last couple years, I've had progressively more issues with that. I like my makeup and my fancy shoes, but if I could snap my fingers and get a sex change, I'd do it in an instant.

I've been on birth control for a long time, and my doctor switched it last year, which killed my sex drive. I got it switched again to fix that issue, but I've found that my gender confusion has thrown a monkey wrench into things. About a year ago, I started masturbating while imagining I had a penis. It went from an occasional thing, to a constant thing, to a thing I did every single time. I can't remember the last time I didn't do that while masturbating. After the recent medicine switch, I'm finding I'm interested in sex again... but not as a female. I'm interested in having sex with women, possibly men, as a man.

I don't want surgery because I feel that it's too expensive and invasive for not enough physical return (absolutely not against it in general, but it's not for me). I'm okay with my female body, though periods and pregnancy absolutely disgust me. I'm stuck in it, for better or worse. I just don't know what to do about my physical gender not matching up with my sexual desires.

I've crossed dressed a few times but it didn't really give me THAT much pleasure or make me feel like I was in the 'right' set of clothes but I love the idea of being a beautiful woman.

Additionally, I really really love Pre-op Mtf trans women and when I look at them I sometimes aspire to be them but are sexually attracted to them as well. The other thing is that I have an endocrine disorder whereby my body produces only pre-pubertal levels of Testosterone (I'm 20) and so I'm actually on TRT, ironic huh. But without this I'm really tired, moody and can't concentrate on anything (I was like this for most of my teenage years before they did a blood test) but I still have these urges to cross dress.

I've always wondered how I'd change if I stopped this TRT completely and go on female hormones but I do like my male body, including penis and I still love both trans and cis women and see myself as a straight male. :(

I'm a genderqueer person who was assigned female at birth.  About a week ago I had my second visit to Planned Parenthood to renew my birth control prescription.  We'll come to that later.  

The first visit happened a few months ago, and it was great!  It was my first time pursuing hormonal birth control.  While I was raised with abstinence-only education, I did my part to research safer sex so I mostly knew what everything was all about.  Still, the doctor needed to ask me plenty of questions, and I had to give lots of answers.  Some of those were about my sex life, my gender, the medications I'm already on...everything went smoothly.  The doctor who had me was curious about my genderqueer identity, so we ended up having a long discussion on what exactly that meant for me and how I came to recognize and embrace my gender identity.  It was great!  They were eager to learn, and I was eager to share.  They thanked me for broadening their horizons, and I left that appointment feeling great with my first ever BC pill prescription in hand.

Fast forward three months.  Since I'm on so many medications, I was only allowed a few months prescription of BC rather than a full year to make sure that nothing went wrong.  I had a different doctor this time, but all I needed was a prescription refill so I expected everything to go as easily as it had the first time.  

That didn't happen.

After waiting for my name to be called, I was taken into an office where I was immediately questioned about my past.  The doctor noticed that I was on antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, the works.  They brought up my psychiatric history as well as my most recent hospitilizations.  I wasn't expecting to talk about my history of suicidal ideation when I just wanted to get BC pills!  I felt vulnerable and uncomfortable; the topic seemed absolutely inappropriate for what I was there for.

Finally, they brought up the notes that the previous doctor had left on my gender identity.  They thought that it was strange that I identified as genderqueer, and asked if I was sexually confused.  There is a lot of chaos and uncertainty in my life, but that is not one of those things.  If there's anything I'm proud and certain of about myself, it's my sexual orientation and gender identity.  I tried telling them as such, but they kept pressing me, explicitly suggesting that my depression, anxiety, and suicidal feelings were due to gender confusion.  

It hurt so much to be told that my problems were due to being genderqueer.  I'm plenty aware that I'm mentally ill, but to have that attributed to my gender identity was humiliating and insulting.  *Anyone* can struggle with mental illness.  I'm not messed up just because my gender identity falls outside the male/female binary!  I was expecting better, especially from a place like Planned Parenthood.  I don't always expect to be understood, but I do expect to be respected.  I don't think that's too much to ask.

I don't know what I'm looking for in posting this.  Sympathy? Commiseration? Insight from other genderqueer people who also happen to struggle with mental illness?  All I know is that it feels good to tell my story.  Thanks for listening.

I suppose I could have posted this in r/relationships or r/sex or in any other number of subreddits, but I think this community might able to offer the most insight into my girlfriend's difficulties.

K and I are both 23, have been a couple for about a year and a half, and have been living together since July. I am a queer femme woman. K prefers female pronouns and to most of the world presents as a masculine gay woman, but her identity is a bit more complicated than that. She strongly considered transitioning to male when she started college but eventually decided she is not a man. She's admitted to me that she also does not identify as a woman. Tentatively, she's used the term genderqueer, even though she hates how political that word sounds. My best way to describe her would probably be ""effeminate transmasculine queer person"" (not exactly a catchy title, but at least a combination of the ways she's described herself). Regardless of the way you put it, though, her gender ambiguity has caused her a lot of pain and angst that she's still struggling with.

We joke about K being stone butch. It's not totally accurate, since I'll touch her and go down on her and all, but there's a grain of truth. She's generally the fucker and I'm the fuckee. I have... mixed emotions about this situation. I do lean towards being a bottom, but I want to give her pleasure as well. When I'm focusing on her, she says something stops her from feeling it and it suddenly seems like she's floating above herself. Sometimes she thinks she might have orgasmed, but she can't say for sure since she feels so disconnected from her body. It's difficult for her to give me feedback about what feels good because of this. I've asked her to show or tell me what she does when she masturbates, but she told me she has this trouble even more when she's riding solo.

The other night, I asked K if this had anything to do with her gender trouble and she agreed that yes, it does. During this conversation she revealed that she wants to get top surgery. I've known for a while that her chest causes her some dysphoria so I ask how she wants it to be touched, if at all, but she always replies that she really doesn't know what she wants.

I guess I'm just at a loss. I don't want to pressure her, but in conversations outside the heat of the moment K's requested that I try to push her gently, bit by bit. But when we're in bed together, I'll go down on her for 20 minutes and she just begs to fuck me instead. It's not like she hasn't tried masturbating, or vibrators, or the usual bag of tricks. And while I want her to feel good and comfortable and horny in the body she has now, I also know that her dysphoria is very real and can't be fixed by run of the mill body acceptance spiels.

I guess I'm just asking for any suggestions you might have. I love K so much and just want to help her carve out a niche she feels alive in. Have you overcome similar problems? How would you like your cisgendered partners to approach a topic like this? What questions do you wish they'd ask?

Hey everyone,

I'm Dogenwolf, a guy who upon serious and lengthy consideration of the nature of genderqueers and genderfluid persons have finally arrived at the conclusion: This describes me and always has. I can't tell you how much of a relief it is to know that there is a word that describes my gender identities (plural).

I was born male but growing up always felt most comfortable alternating my dress between both genders and sometimes blending the two. I always felt a bit alienated even from my gay friends who were certain about their gender; even the guys who wear makeup when they go out to the club always identified as being very much male. I never knew what it meant to have a fixed perception of your own gender and now that I have a rudimentary understand of the term genderqueer, and a greater understanding of myself, I am *grateful* that I don't have a fixed gender identity.

I feel liberated, freed from my own expectations of gender conformity. I don't have to think of myself as a man or a woman because I am and can be all permutations of what those words mean to me, up to and including their total absence.

Two weeks ago I felt my identity shift towards the feminine and I followed the tide out. A week ago I felt a shift towards the masculine and I followed the tide back in. I no longer fight it, I move with it and it is *magic.* **I** am magic.

I also find that it's given me more security when it comes to my sexuality as well and I feel more inclined to investigate those parts of my sexuality that I felt were improper. I feel more secure with myself, so I feel no shame in them and, in fact, am proud and excited to be who I am, whoever that may be at any given time. It's fitting that I'm a Pisces (mutable water sign), too. The most notorious unstable sign, but I've found that in embracing my unstable identity I have found something incredibly stable and predictable. Yes, it shifts constantly like the moon, but now I *understand*.

Just wanted to say *hi* to all my fellow genderqueers and allies and say thank you for building this community for people like me to find solace in.",,False,,t5_2r1c3,1376686718.0,,genderqueer-ainbow,True,t3_1kiaxv,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1kiaxv/new_genderqueer/,

I am comfortable with society as a whole seeing me as a man. However, internally, I don't really see myself as a man *as opposed to a woman*. I feel that gender is a construct, and there are times when I feel more like a woman than a man, and that *most of the time* I don't feel like a **man** or a **woman** - I'm somewhere in between, or outside... or... something. I think genderqueer is a nice term for it. Maybe I'm a genderqueer man or something. But like I said, I don't mind the rest of the world not hearing the 'genderqueer' qualifier and just seeing me as a man when I'm out and about interacting with them (and I can be a pretty lady on my own, inside with some ice cream and a mirror :) ).

The one person who's an exception... is my girlfriend. She knows that I crossdress. She's fine with it, although she doesn't get involved herself. The thing is, when we first got together, she asked me to describe my sexuality to her in as much detail as possible, so she could really understand where I am on that spectrum. (To be honest, since I don't really believe in gender as a fixed thing, you probably won't be surprised to hear that I don't really have a fixed sexuality :p but the closest is bisexual). My girlfriend is asexual, so we are both in not-so-straightforward sexuality categories. She was really good about getting to understand my perspective on that, and early in the relationship we talked about sexuality a lot. (We don't talk about it much any more since we are comfortable with each other after being together for over a year now).

But she never has asked me 'please tell me about your gender in as much detail as possible'. So although she *knows* about my 'woman' side, she has never really acknowledged it. Every now and then I will say something about myself in a feminine context, and she often replies with ""but you're a man!"". Recently we were discussing something to do with 'geek girls' and I said something about myself, and she laughed and said ""you're not a girl!"". In this situations I usually shrug it off and say ""hah, well..."" and trail off without saying anything.

To be honest, it is not a big deal. If she sees me as a man, well, that doesn't change who I am. She has never been mean about it. I don't feel that it impedes my quality of life much or at all. It's just that at those moments, I guess the girl inside of me feels like she's being silenced, and the man (who gets most of the control of my mouth!) never stands up for her.

I don't know what to do. Is it worth bringing this up with her? Has anyone had to have a conversation like that? How did it go? What would be a good way to bring it up? I don't want to make her feel bad or overstate the situation... but I don't want to trivialise and ignore my identity around the most important person in my life, either.

Another complication is that my girlfriend is very interested in feminist issues. I consider myself a feminist as well, and have read up on feminism, but I am careful not to inject my male voice and speak for women or anything like that. I'm a white man, who is not straight but has a girlfriend, so is not obviously LGBT+ to the outside world. My girlfriend is not white, nor a man. I don't want to come across as sort of 'bandwagoning' myself into being a minority, or like I'm pretending the issues that minorities can suffer from are a big problem for me as well. This is especially relevant in that geek girl conversation - I'm sure every redditor knows that geeks who come across as women can have a pretty hard time sometimes. I'm in no danger of being seen as a woman by most people, so I don't have those problems. But I do consider myself *in some ways* a girl, and certainly a geek. So I don't want to be included in the group of 'people who suffer as a result of being both a geek and a girl', but I would like someone close to me to appreciate that actually I am both a geek and a girl, however atypical my experience of that is.

Thanks to TurtleTape for setting it up!

I have some ideas if you guys want to make it a more regular thing.

One: We should have suggested topic(s) that we come up with beforehand. This gives us introverts in the audience time to think about what we might like to say. Of course, we can open up the floor to questions, concerns, and updates from one another.

The topics chosen should relate in some way to gender identity and presentation, simply because this is the one thing we all have in common. Some tangents are fine, but some structure is a very good thing.

Two: I felt that there were two separate conversations going on at once- stuff happening on cam and stuff happening in the chat. It would be nice if we all tried to listen and respond to everyone. All should have a chance to speak. Questions posed to one another about a topic we all have plenty of interest in (Gender!) might help the conversation be more balanced between participants.

It was great to meet you all, and I hope we can keep having things like this! It could be very beneficial to us all.",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,genderqueer-pan,True,t3_1embnt,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1embnt/genderqueer_meetupchat_ideas/,

As I explored my gender expression, one of the first outward things I decided to change was to do away with a word I dreaded: ""girlfriend"".
So, we talked about it, and agreed to use ""partner"" ""significant other"" or ""loof"" instead. (loof is my favorite)

So my question to all of you is, as a genderqueer person in a relationship, what do/would you use? If your partner is also genderqueer, do you use the same one, or different ones? If your significant other is male or female, what do they prefer?

&gt;&lt;3 you are such a lover. Why can't you just be a boy so I could fly out there and marry you tomorrow?

I ask her why.

&gt;Because you'd make the best most caring and intelligent boyfriend ever. You pretty much have it all.

It was so incredibly flattering. Lately I've come to accept that, not only was I a tomboy growing up but I'm not an ally for the LGBT movement - I'm part of it. This was conflicting for me. Prior to a couple months ago, I would have never considered myself part of the community.


When I joined reddit, I watched a bunch of subs, and a bunch for LGBT and other queer issues, wanting to educate myself so I would never have to inadvertently stick my foot in my mouth and upset someone else. I only knew trans* individuals from a chat I belonged to online, so I figured hey, I want to know more, so I especially digged into trans* issues. Found a ftm (though not very friendly) chat, and wanted to learn more. The chat didn't last long for me, and I didn't find it helpful.


All while this was happening, I decided that I wanted to lose weight (as of this past August).  I have been told that I am a very attractive woman, and although on the chubby (for some) or just plain fat (for others), I decided – even if I was happy with my body, I would lose weight to be healthier.


As it went on, my partner didn't pay much attention to my progress and honestly didn't seem to care. It, along with our deadbedroom situation, it just felt like he had no interest for my body anymore, so between trying to lose weight, it being a frustratingly slow process, and finding myself ugly, I really began to hate my body. Before all of this, I accepted that I was a woman. I never questioned myself or thought of myself as genderqueer. It never was on my mind – even if I've been quite the tomboy as a kid and even as an adult.


Of the past few days, I've accepted that this body isn't “mine.” I don't feel like I am connected, and I even feel a disconnect from who I was two years ago, it's a lot to swallow. My mind doesn't feel 100% femme and I realized that some (not all) of my unhappiness comes with me feeling awkward in my body. I'm at an age where I'm supposed to dress quite feminine (especially as a professional) and I really just want to say “fuck you” to the system.


As I slowly lose more weight I think I will be happier with my body. I am hoping to feel at one with myself again, and accept myself again – I have absolutely no desire to transition, and honestly, I find dicks pretty damn ugly and I would hate to get bottom or top surgery. I'm at a body type where I would NEVER look good as a man, but I do look nice dressed somewhat masculine (I have described it to others as quite preppy or athletic). And definitely exciting, I will only look better as I lose more weight.


So those texts were absolutely amazing to read. I've thought about male names I would want if I were born male, and how I would live my life if I was a taller, with the successful life that I am striving to achieve now. Though I know I can never be someone's boyfriend, it was extremely flattering and just rubbed me all the right ways. I have not come out to anyone. I mentioned it to my partner before he left for basic military training but he has no idea to the extent that I feel. I am afraid that he will not accept me and will not want to be with me. But then another part of me finds that silly, as I'm not changing, I'm merely putting a label to how I've been my entire life.


I hope everyone's had a wonderful Christmas, or other holidays if Christmas isn't your thing (mine personally was terrible and I'm emotionally drained from family drama and bullshit).

1350091762.0,16,self.genderqueer,11e9a4,A better way to describe sexual orientation.,kabukistar,18,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/11e9a4/a_better_way_to_describe_sexual_orientation/,"Warning: wall of text ahead.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the [Kinsey Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Scale), made by Dr. Kinsey as a way to express sexual orientation as a gradient between straight and gay, rather than a binary.  It's a much more robust system than simply saying ""straight or gay"", but I still feel it's lacking in a number of ways. 

Namely, I see two areas where it is lacking: First, it fails to acknowledge that people have varying degrees of attraction overall (like asexuals) and not just varying objects of their attraction.  Second, it fails to differentiate between sex and gender with regards to attraction.  Maybe a person's self-identity is important to if you find them attractive, but their physical sex isn't, or visa versa.  Or possibly it's how masculine/feminine they are, regardless of either of the above factors.

I'd like to create a new scale/system for describing sexual orientation in a more inclusive/full way, and I'd like to get the opinion from the fine readers of /r/genderqueer.



Here's my ideas so far: basically, each person's sexual preference, rather than being represented by a number or a word, is best described by a matrix.  At it's most basic, it would be a 2x2 matrix like this:

    [A1 A2]
    [B1 B2]

You could have one of the axes (let's say the horizontal one) refer to sex while the other one refers to gender.  For example, say that everything in the left-hand row refers to someone who's physically female and everything in the right-hand row refers to someone who's physically male.  Then, everything in the top row refers to someone who identifies as male, and everything in the bottom row refers to someone who identifies as female.    So, if you're following me, A1 would be someone whose sex is female and gender identity is male.  A2 would be someone whose sex and gender identity are male.  B1 would be someone whose sex and Gender identity are female, and B2 would be someone whose sex is male and gender identity is female.  

Given this information, you can put a number (or possibly colour) into each of these cells to represent your level of interest in people that fit that description.  For example, if you only liked people whose gender identity is female, and can go either way on sex, your gender identity might go like this:

    [0 0]
    [8 8]


Conversely, if you only like people whose sex is female and can go either way for gender, then your matrix might look like this:

    [8 0]
    [7 0]

Both these people would describe themselves as liking women (based on the Kinsey scale), but they are, in a way, two very different sexual orientations.  Someone who's asexual, but romantically interested in everyone might have something like this:

    [2  2]
    [2  2]

Where-as someone who is only interested in people whose sex and gender are male, and who has a high sex drive would be more like this:

    [0  9]
    [0  0]

I'm thinking the scale should range from ""people in this group interest me about as much as your average rock"" to ""I would basically have sex with every single person in this group, if given the chance.""


Of course, the 2x2 matrix is the basic version.  You can make it more/less rows depending on how fine of a gradient you want it to be.  With gender, you would want to include people who feel completely separate from male and female, people who identify as feminine men, masculine women, etc.  For sex, you would want to make a space for intersex people as well as various points ways of transitioning for trans people.  Here's what a larger matrix might look like:

    [ A1  A2  A3  A4 ]  
    [ B1  B2  B3  B4 ]  
    [ C1  C2  C3  C4 ]  
    [ D1  D2  D3  D4 ]

I like my male body. If I was female, I'd probably like my body just as much, but my history is as male so that is what I am familiar with and prefer. So I confidently say that my physical gender identity is male, with the acceptance that this is my personal preference and that there is nothing *inherently* worse about being female-bodied.

However, it is everything else about being male that I have a problem with. I cannot accept gender roles, male privilege, the patriarchy, etc. The thought that the gender I identify with is responsible for such oppression of women and sexual minorities fills me with shame and frustration. Even more so than how I dislike the pressures associated with the social construction of masculinity, I feel guilt about the social pressures and discrimination I avoided by being born male instead of female. 

It bothers me that I am so opposed to the social connotations, privileges, and implications of being male but feel powerless to express this to others. I just want to be able to wash my hands of it, and say that although I am physically male, I reject the social gender identity that goes with it. Is it wrong to want this?

A good friend of mine started talking to me about a year ago about her husband. She confessed to me that he was transgendered, and had just came out to her. She didn't know who else to really talk to about this but knew I was all down with the LGBT thing so thought I was the safest one to talk to about it all. I gave her advice, listened to her, and let her know if she ever needed to talk I was here for her. 

What I didn't tell her at first was that I spent most of my early life looking into gender studies and always felt myself as being trans(f2m) I remember reading an article about a woman who got a sex change to male in her 40s - after she was married with children. It struck such a cord with me when I was a kid. I even went so far as to do a lot of research and think about reconsigment surgery. It wasn't until I was talking to a trans friend of mine about it, and I voiced my worries - I'm only 4'9"" and have a hard enough life as female, that I wasn't sure if I could be male and at this height. She suggested I try living as a female - something I was born as but have never really LIVED as. Even as a small child I always passed as a boy, I kept my hair short, my friends were boys, and in high school I even adapted a boy's name as a nickname. So I did.. I lived life as a female from age 19 onward. Fast foward to now - I'm married, with 2 kids. My husband knows of my past and my feelings - he's been with me since I was a teen - but admits he loves the female side of me. 

And with my friend talking to me about her husband, a lot of long lost buried thoughts and feelings are coming back. Like I've been lying to myself, or to the world, and that I'm doing a disservice to the trans world because even though I feel inherently male, I still live in a female body, but I don't want to live a half life. I don't want to have to feel like I need to justify myself in why I feel like this and why I don't think I can change. Not because I'm worried about my husband, or my kids, but because in some weird way I'm so adapted now to life as a female I don't know if I can ever be just ONE gender. I'm not really feeling anymore like I am just male, or just female, but like I'm a wonderful mix of the two.

and I guess I don't know, that for the first time in 10 years a lot of forgotten feelings are coming up and I don't know how to deal with them. I finally came out and told my friend I was trans, and so that's why I know so much, but I feel now like that was a lie, like I thought I WAS trans all those years ago but now? I'm not so sure.

Initially, they were supportive because I seemed happy and whatnot. After about a month, though, my mom became less and less supportive. She's been like ""you were born a girl and you should act as one."" It really upset me but I continued to dress in loose clothes and button ups. The beginning of summer, my step mom's kids came to stay with us and I had to come out to them. The youngest, Haven, was the most supportive. She helped me so much -- calling by my preferred name and pronouns. One day while I was out, though, she got into a fight with my mom's other kid, Ryan, and it made my step mom pull me aside and tell me that I need to come out to Ryan and his dad because she didn't want to see Ryan &amp; Haven arguing over whether **I** was a girl or boy. Haven and her brother have gone home and all but more and more recently I've been having conflicting feelings. I'm not sure if coming out was my best choice especially if this could have been a ""phase"" (I hate that phrase, really). 
My question is: what can I do? I love being able to call myself a boy but I also love dresses and skirts and frills. I've never been able to put a name to my feelings so I went with trans* because that seemed to fit the most at the time but when I found the term ""gender queer"", I realized that I shouldn't have jumped so quickly into coming out as trans. Any time I go out with my mom to get clothes, she questions me. Like, I was trying out dresses and she said ""I thought you wanted to be a boy"". How would I go about explaining everything to her and my step mom?",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,genderqueer-pan,True,t3_r7ill,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/r7ill/ive_been_creeping_here_for_awhile_and/,

Even more recently, I started cross-dressing in private without really understanding why I was doing it other than that I have been curious about what it would be like to be female since I was a teenager, and I find women's fashion interesting. Let me first state that I am not gender dysphoric; for me to have the confidence to let myself cross-dress I had to first really look at my body and realize that I really do like my male-body and I enjoy being male, whatever that means. 

What's got me thinking I am bigender is that when I am *en femme* there are subtle changes in the way I behave and think. I fold my underwear before putting it away, I think I move differently, I dance femininely, and I prefer music by female musicians. What's really got me freaked out is that when I am *en femme* I love wearing a bra, and what I love even more is being able to fill out the bra (artificially of course, using rice in tied-off pantyhose feet). Wearing a stuffed bra feels so natural to me, and I often find myself forgetting I am wearing a bra or have fake boobs, reminding myself only when they get in the way of my arms or vision. Yesterday I found myself wrapping my arms around my bust and enjoying the look and feel of my chest and wishing they were real and I could always have breasts. However, when I'm not *en femme*...this weirds me out, as I normally like my flat male chest and pelt of chest hair, and have no desire to permanently stop being male.

So, I think I may be bigender, which would mean I have separate male and female gender identities, and I switch between expressing my personality through my male identity and female identity. Does anyone else have experience with questioning their gender identity after they started questioning their sexual orientation? Also, can anyone tell me about bigenderism?",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,,True,t3_qrryi,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/qrryi/realized_i_am_likely_bisexual_now_think_i_might/,

Was married with another GQ (pretty as hell, she had a gay boy inside) and for the time she liked what we did, till the antipsychotics cut down her sexual urges. We divorced in 2007, but a range of reasons.

I am not ""easy"". I am naturally drawn to those halfway the gender polarity; butch girls, effeminate boys, maybe even other genderqueers. Problem is I live in a country of faux-tolerants - the Netherlands. It isn't as much as the Dutch are tolerant, it's more most of them are ""bourgeois"" and ""unimaginative"" and ""apathic"".

So I went dating. Sure I did the dark rooms, and got some **wide eyed stares** there. They don't often get my type who goes through ten cocks on a night. It's nice, but it doesn't leave me fulfilled. I'll do that about four times every year, plus some on the side, all quite safe.

So, where can I date best? What is the best place to find the like-minded and be left satisfied and happy and *with someone* ? Because the traditional dating sites do not have much power for someone who is *and* bisexual, *and* pansexual, *and* genderqueer, *and* rather intense...

It has been great fun. But yesterday I told him I was genderqueer and he does. not. get it. I've been trying to explain why it matters that he respect my gender and it's not working. I want to keep trying because he's not being purposefully hateful, just super ignorant. I'll give the highlights from his point of view so you can see what I mean (he's not a native English speaker so some of it might read a little oddly):


""For me you are just UnicornPower420, when I see you I dont think of you as a girl but just as UnicornPower420. Of course for me it does matter that you are a girl because i am not attracted to men but i don't see you as a girl constantly. Me not wanting to call you they or she or whatever you like is because i dont see any point in it, i enjoyed hanging around with you and having fun with you regardless of any personal pronouns. I respect that you feel different from others, and please dont say i dont because i am truthfull to my word but why should we dwell on such a difference of perception. I see you as a girl, you don't see it that way and i respect you for that but don't force me to do things which i don't believe in. I mean, I could bullshit you and say that I am totally comfortable with calling you they but i'm just not. I don't understand why you lose your respect for me when i am trying to be honest towards you. Having respect for each other doesn't mean you should totally understand each other but you let the other live his life like he wants too without inteference or at least it does for me.""


I told him to imagine he was saying those things about my orientation instead of my gender, e.g. even though I think of myself as bi he thinks of me as straight and I have to respect that, in the hopes that the analogy would make the issue make more sense, but it didn't seem to work. I even conceded that he didn't have to use my pronouns or be a decent ally or anything, just try to be understanding. I also told him that he's trying to put me in a closet to make himself more comfortable and that's shitty. That seems to have made him defensive.


""What I understand from your message is that you don't feel comfortable being around me while knowing that I think of you as a girl. I am not uncomfortable about your mixed feeling about your gender and i acknowledge it. I never said that you should act as a girl because i want you to. I only said that i perceive you as a girl and for me you are one.""


I don't even with this last part though:
""But having hurt feelings doesn't give you the moral high ground. I feel you are making no effort at all to see my point of view, your stuck in a loop of i am hurt and your wrong and you have to change. Don't you see that you are doing the same thing to me as you are accusing me of. You have seen a side of me that doesn't appeal to you and you immediately start talking about breaking things off. Well to be honest i have seen i side of you that didn't appeal to me directly but you let the other be because that is what you do around people, you give and take because you enjoy being around them so you forget about their less appealing sides. I am just not all pro transgender, not against it in any way but you won't see me standing on the barricades waving the rainbow flag. That is just the way it is, there are probably things i feel strongly about and you don't. But I'll give you all the room you need to give outing to your gender but don't expect from me that i become just as passionate about it as you. In a way you are doing the same thing as the anti-transgender people. You are like the believer who doesn't want to hear anything else then what appeals to his believes. You get shocked and upset when you find out that not all people share the same opinions on things. Well that is life, there are probably tons of people who don't like me or my opinions but it is there right to do so. Difference is what makes the world go around. This doesn't mean that transgenders should be beat up because there different but it also doesn't mean that everyone should agree with them. I always had a great time hanging out with you so why should we get stuck on this subject. I understand that being transgender is a major part of you and again i respect that side of you but also leave room for me to have my own opinions. Why are you setting all these rules and boundaries for us to hang out. You are not to weird for me or anything but please don't become like those zealots who can't stand a slight difference of opinion and want everyone to walk the same path, wear the same clothes and think alike because that is one of the few things i can't stand. I tried my best to describe my feelings, I hope you'll understand what i am trying to say.""

How can I explain that our opinions on this matter are absolutely not equally valid? Like it's so obviously bullshit to me but I don't know what to say about it that will make sense to him. I really don't want to give up yet since I have an opportunity to educate, but I'm at a loss here. Halp :c

I'm a 27 genderqueer, bio-F (not thinking of transition) but definitely on the more f2m spectrum, sexuality wise I'm also very fluid (pansexual its hard to say) but am going through a very asexual phase, and its interesting that my sexual and gender identity is now becoming clearer that I haven't been attracted to physical sex for a while. I've always been this way, (tomboy, androgynous, bi) but its not just in the way I act or dress, it's also me, at a very deep level.

So. I live in a fairly small, fairly conservative town. I came here to go to community college for cheap, after living in a larger, more liberal city.

I think in the city, my dysphoria wasn't as apparent, because I could present myself any way I wanted without being ostracized. Now, however, the restrictive ideals of the small town I'm is has forced me to either conform to their ideals about gender, or be treated like I'm less than human. At first I conformed, I'm not even sure I was aware I was doing it.

Over time gender conforming felt more and more like a prison, until I finally broke down and decided my mind was absolutely-for-sure not female. I still don't really know what my ideal gender is, but for now calling myself genderqueer and going back to looking more decidedly androgynous has helped. There's still the problem of how people here see me.

In the city I felt that people, if the judged me at all, did so based on how I chose to present myself. Here, however, it feels like everybody's view of everybody else is colored by what gender they're perceived to be. There are very strong stereotypes here about the differences between males and females, men and women. I've found that it only gets worse if you try to present as something outside the gender binary. I've noticed a gradual increase in disapproval from my bosses at work, though my co-workers and friends have been great.

**So today,** I went into a local Great Clips to try to get a kind-of androgynous, punk-ish haircut, and I'm sitting there, trying to explain what I want, and the lady that's going to cut my hair has to call this other girl over, and they're still not getting it, and finally the kinda get it, and one of them says ""that's too complicated"" and the other one agrees and I'm thinking ""What the fuck? I thought you were supposed to know how to cut hair! I could get this exact thing so easily in Portland!"".

Anyway, they decide that they can't even try the haircut I want (I probably should have left at this point) and offer to get me some of their hair-styles books, and ask if I want women's or men's. I don't want either, but I say mens, and of course ALL of the hairstyles are significantly shorter than I want, except for maybe a handful that are longer than I want. I really don't know why I stayed at this point, or why I picked the one I did, but by the time I got home all of this frustration just turned into a huge crying fit, and a vow to never get my hair cut in this stupid little town.

**TL;DR:** Small-town hairstylists have no idea how to do hairstyles outside the gender binary. I weep.",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,,True,t3_1a0806,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1a0806/haircuts_fuck/,

 I know given how long I've been looking at the material here it may be too soon for me to say something like this, but I still felt it needed to be said.

---

Ever since I was a young teenager, I've always felt something was off about me.  I've always enjoyed being a guy, despite these feelings.

I had tried minor crossdressing, and it did make make me feel better occasionally, but I still felt that something was wrong. After a while I had begun to question if the feeling I was getting was not that I wanted to crossdress, but perhaps I was just finding some way of acting out within the abusive household I was in.  After a while this lost it's appeal, and I never did understand quite why. Though this did roughly coincide with the time I got out of that abusive situation.

I've since kept going, being your typical cisgender male, but I've still felt something was wrong, I would see a pretty girl and I would get feelings I really didn't understand.  I would be attracted to them, but I would also have some negative feeling alongside it. 

About a year ago, I started making sense of these feelings.  I was jealous.  I was jealous of the way their clothes fit, of the way thier body curves, of the way they moved. I began to think maybe I was transexual, maybe I was exhibiting a mild bit of gender dysphoria or something, which considering I would occasionally fantasize about being a woman could make some sense.  However I had no desire to go through any of surgeries or that type of thing.  But as I started to spend more time considering it, I started coming to more realizations.  

I like being a guy.  But I wouldn't mind being a girl, either.  If some magic or sci-fi event were to occur and I suddenly swapped genders, I would be perfectly fine with that, it'd be status quo from the other side of the isle.  However, the more time I spent thinking about this, the more I realized that even that wasn't quite true.  As I've said, I like being a guy, and being overwieght like I am, I've always had a bit of a body image issue. 

Recently I began to notice that despite my excessive weight, and otherwise cisgender attitudes, I didn't mind what the weight had done to my chest.  I'm ashamed of the fat in my stomach area, in my thighs, in my arms, and my face.  But I'm not ashamed of the chest.  There's something there, something that pushes out.  Regardless of how unnatural it would seem I was happy with my fat chest.  But even up until week ago I still had gone nowhere with this.

However, I had once again started questioning if there was something *wrong* with me.  Why was I pleased about this some days, and some days where I felt like I wanted to rip my own skin off.

[Then I saw this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12u481/1_year_and_hormones_later_i_have_never_felt_as/) and while there wasn't anything specific in that thread, I began looking into the transgender side of reddit.  /r/lgbt, /r/transgender, all the sidebar stuff.  The lists of resources, the faqs, the posts in the subreddits.

/r/genderqueer really resonated with me, and with it's related subreddits I finally began to see things that touched me in a place I didn't know existed.  I started asking myself new questions about my life, and suddenly, I was coming up with answers.  Not to everything, but these were answers to questions I had never even known where to start, so I've really started getting a new understanding of myself.

Suddenly my life started making more sense than it ever had before.  I had answers to old questions and I had new questions which were getting some answers too.  And that brings me to today.

I've had a lot of time over the last couple of days to be introspective.

I'm starting to learn who I am.  Sure, I still have far many more questions than I have answers. But I'm learning about me.  And I don't think I could've done it without you.

Sure, there are labels thrown around, and I feel I may adopt one or 2 of them at some point.  For now, I'm content to just know that there's both a place where people are asking the questions and finding the answers I'm starting to consider, or even questions I haven't thought of yet. And that there is a place where I can talk to others when I really don't know how to interpret something myself.

The point of all of this is... **Thank you.**  Thank you for being here for others.  Thank you for being here for youself.  Even if I'm new here thank you preemptively for being here for me.  Just... thank you to the entire community.

As up front, I do apologize because I'm not familiar with what words are and are not taboo, or the lingo around here.

I'm a twenty-year old bi-(or pan-)sexual born-female. And, for most of my life I've been fine with that. I am a bit of a ""tomboy"" though. [I'm not overly girly, like shopping for dresses and shoes, I don't like going out with my ""girlfriends"" on every other date, I don;t put makeup on, etc. But I've.. also always wondered what it's like to be a male, and something more than just curiosity.  [Like if a fairy came up to me and offered me any wish except for the cliched ones of love peace, stoping starvation, etc. I'd seriously consider wishes to become a boy] 

But at the same time, I identify as a female. Even though I don't act extremely girly, I still /feel/ like a girl. I like make-up every now and then, I like wearing dresses every now-and then, I like being female. The problem lies when I think about having sex.

[This next paragraph is sexually descriptive]
Take in mind that I'm a virgin. I've only had one girlfriend (no boyfriends) in my entire life. I'm know I'm attracted to both male and females [physically and emotionally] but I just *can't* picture having vaginal intercourse. I *can't* think about having either a man (or a woman with a strap-on) putting something other than a finger/tongue into my vagina. It... quite frankly... grosses me out. I mean, I can imagine fingering and licking, and vagina against vagina. I can imagine using a strap-on (or even being a male and using my penis) into another female, I can imagine being a male and having anal intercourse (either me or the other man entering), and I can imagine having anal intercourse as a female with another male/female-with strapon... but
just having somebody put something into my vagina doesn't feel right to my imagination.
I don't know if it's because I'm inexperienced, or if it's because as a child I was felt up down there by people five years older than me against my will, or something else entirely.

And, I don't want to go through with a sex-change because I feel comfortable in my own body. I like my boobs, I like my hips, I like appearing and dressing, and acting like a female. I like my body, but it's just the vagina that feels weird.

Can anybody offer anything? Opinions? Suggestions? Explanations? Empathy?

I identify as non binary, born male with a soul that's mostly feminine and kind of masculine also :-) I am in the process of making small changes like growing out my hair, shaving body hair, etc to bring myself closer to the gender I feel.

I would also like to try low dose HRT (M to F), but am having a hard time finding information. I am hoping there are at least a few people here who may have tried low dose HRT. I will appreciate if you can help me with answers for a few questions.

1. What dosage constitutes low dose HRT ?
2. I have heard people say that taking a little Estrogen might get the body to produce more Testosterone. However, I have also read that the mechanism that produces LH which regulates production of T, cannot distinguish between T and E. So a lititle increase in E should at least theoretically decrease T production.
3. Does Dutesteride effect mental cognition (I have read this on a few hair loss forums) ?
4. Is it possible to go all natural if low dose HRT is all I want ? What is your opinion of the following regimen (Licorice + Spearmint Tea + Tofu + Soy Milk)
5. What kind of physical and psychological changes can I expect from low dose HRT ?
6. Are the risks of blood clotting also low when taking low dose HRT, or are the risks still comparable to regular dosages ?
7. If you are already in low dose HRT, can you please share your dosage details ?

Most folks that really know me, know this, but if you just looked at me, I'd probably look like a tom boy, boyish, or kind of dykey. Which is cool.

I have this friend who identifies as male, trans, and going to towards female. They've been doing this for a really long time, and are self identified experts. However, when they learned of my being genderqueer, they have been almost competing with me, and undercutting my gender identity regularly. 

This last event was when I had to go get some blood draws to check my hormone levels. (I had some problems with the girl parts, and they were trouble shooting.) Surprisingly I came up with some atypical values. Higher than average T for someone who has a more feminine look. I posted this because I'm really open, and everyone was joking about maybe I really am just that much of a man. I could care less, and turns out it wasn't the problem they were looking for, so shrug. 

My buddy came on, and then started nosing around that I'd have to have some unusual characteristics for that to be true, and then asks about my genitals. I respond with a ""what?!""

Then they send me a personal email detailing how my values are probably not really indicative of my gender status at all, and really got condescending. I told them I wasn't questioning their biology, but thought they were asking for my clit size which was way too personal a question to be asking. After that, radio silence.

I am kind of distancing myself from them because we can't talk about gender without them taking this trans authority position. I've been dealing with this my whole life (I'm old), and I think part of their issue is I am not heading to transition. 

How have the rest of you dealt with this kind of thing? I've seen other folks here have similar experiences. I'm seriously thinking of cutting ties at this point.

I'm a long time lurker and don't post very often to ANY subreddit, so this is very new and a little frightening to me. 

I'm a biological female and recently realized that I'm genderfluid. I've only told my good friends and my boyfriend, and everyone is quite accepting of it. I bought a tri-top binder a few weeks ago and when I wear I feel like the ocean has been drained out of my lungs and I'm finally the way I was always supposed to be. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm happy being female-bodied. I like to look very feminine sometimes, but most of the time I feel trapped. And my binder has quickly become something I'm not comfortable going without. But a few days ago I began to really worry about what binding (a little over half of the time) would do to my breasts. I really don't want them to be damaged or extremely saggy (shit, i hate that word). My boyfriend has also expressed this concern and I really don't want to become unattractive in his eyes.  

I've read that in order to keep this from happening you can't bind more than a few times every two weeks. And this is devastating to me. I really need some help and advice and I so appreciate anyone who takes the time to hear me out and offer their experiences or opinions.

I've found myself questioning my gender identity.  I know for sure that I am not cisgender.  After that, I'm less sure.  I definitely lean more towards ""woman,"" but I'm not sure that even that feels quite right.

Since coming out I've had a number of moments in which I thought I was absolutely sure that I was a transwoman.  I've had some moments when I thought I might be bi/tri/3rd gender or gender fluid.  I'm still pretty confused on the matter.

At this very moment, I don't *feel* like a woman as much as I do at other times.  Then again, I've been really depressed.  I've very much felt like I'm putting myself back in the closet, internally.  I've had thoughts like ""you just have to play with equipment you're given"" and I'm questioning whether the whole thing was just some kind of dream.

One reason that I didn't come to the conclusion that I'm trans* earlier was because I looked at my friend J (ftm; hormones + top surgery only) who was so clear about his gender identity and thought, ""I'm not like that, I must not be trans.""  8 years later, I know that there's a lot more to trans* than simply wanting to be on the opposite end of the binary.

Whenever I'm out and I see women, all I think is ""I wish I could look like that"" or ""I wish I could be like that.""  And yet, I know that I probably never will.  By the same token, I don't hate my body.  I mean, it's a nice enough body.  It just feels foreign.  And yet not foreign at the same time.  Familiar perhaps?

Not that it's actually based in science, but sometimes oI get the sense that I have too much testosterone.  I'm always too hot, I hate my sex drive.  I'll be trying to make friends with a woman and this voice in my head interjects and says ""fuck her; get laid;"" and it feels like more than just the typical struggle between lust and affection.  Like those thoughts aren't mine, like they don't belong.

**tl;dr** I often feel like I want to be a woman.  Right now I'm depressed and also questioning my gender identity.


I know that I don't have make any decisions about my identity immediately, but I'm struggling and trying to find some clarity.

* those of you have/are planning to transition, have you ever had moments where you kinda lost the feeling?

* other genderqueer folk, have you found some kind of happy medium that enables you to feel comfortable without HRT or surgery?

When I first came to college, I intended to figure out exactly where I fit into the gender spectrum. On one of the first days I was here, one of my new friends declared to everybody that they were genderqueer. I've been out for awhile, and just about everybody I was friends with was somehow aligned with the LGBTQ community in some way, so this didn't come across as strange. I was just filled with questions about what it was. When they explained to me exactly what that was, I quietly accepted it and began to think about myself. I had come out as gay when I was 13 but that never seemed to quite capture how I felt. I had questioned my gender heavily when I was 14 and told a friend about it. She was overwhelmingly supportive, and helped me get through some of what I now know is dysphoria. I had kind of played with the idea of telling my parents about it in hopes of maybe getting hormones to kind of delay some of puberty, but never acted on it. (By the way, I'm fairly ignorant in terms of hormones and have a few basic questions that I'll ask later.) 

Once I finally figured out what genderqueer was, I thought that I had it all figured out! All of my friends at school have been nothing but supportive, accepting my request to have gender neutral pronouns used when talking about me. They way I had thought of it, I didn't *hate* being male, I just wasn't a huge fan of it. I figured that there had already been 18 years as only being male, why not switch it up with a few female pronouns every now and then? Recently I saw the subreddit that was dedicated to timelines throughout peoples' transitions, and instantly saw how the happy the people in the after pictures were. I thought about all of those times I would break down crying when I looked in the mirror when I was a scared 14 year old and wanted to give myself a hug and explain that I wasn't broken, but that it was something that I should embrace and cherish and love. I knew after seeing the first person that had the same body type and facial structure at me transition from a handsome man to a beautiful woman and knew that I could be the one having the best time of my life.

After a random wave of dysphoria this evening, I decided that starting next year when I live off-campus in a house with my two best friends that I would spend all of my time in social situations as female. I want to inform my parents of this, and try to explain to them that I want to try hormones to possibly just block testosterone to some extent (Is that a thing?) I know that no matter what they won't be angry with me or tell me that I can't do that; I'm just worried that they won't understand, and want me to attend therapy to try to make me more male, rather than go to therapy to attempt to become the person that I want to be. 

Another anxiety that I have is transitioning in school. I attend a liberal arts school in a fairly accepting town, and I don't think I would encounter too many issues from students. I plan on transitioning for school during the second semester of next year which would *hopefully* be when I could start hormones as well. Would it be appropriate to e-mail my professors before the first day of class letting them know about a possible name and gender difference than what would be on their roster?

I see a lot of speech through out about identities and such. From what I know, there are those that associate as males, there are those that associate as females, and there are people who are gender-fluid, which tend to switch between the two. Is that correct? What do you refer to somebody who doesn't really care for or feel like they have a gender? For example, I am biologically male, but I don't really feel like a guy, nor do I really feel like a girl. I just feel like myself, to give a poor explanation. A person without a sexuality is referred to as asexual; is a person without an associated gender agender? Does it work like that?

I've started to dress a bit more femininely. To continue on the aforementioned explanation, I'm not trying to dress feminine because I feel feminine, but just because I like some dresses and some typically female clothing. Are there any good places that sell either androgynous clothes or female clothes that still fit a male (For example, I do not have breasts). [Here's an example of my body type plus the first dress I just bought!](http://imgur.com/a/C9SJW)

As I've started wearing dresses, I figure that it's good to shave my legs (plus they feel pretty nice now), but it's a bit difficult. How do you people get the upper-back of your legs, if you do shave? In addition, how  often do you shave your legs? My legs still feel like they're a bit stubbly, even after shaving with a three-blade women's razor. How could I get a closer shave? With my underarms, it's even harder to get a close shave.

I've told my parents that I'm going to be dressing a bit differently and they are fine with that, so I'm starting to dress around the house to get comfortable with my new clothes. Is there anything I should know before wearing these new clothes in public (I am a senior in high school and a student of a college)? I expect to get some odd stares at first, but that's not a big issue!

Thanks for all the help! Seriously, you guys are great! I hope to meet all 2,682 of you! I'll post more questions if I have any.

Hi. I'm Al.

So! I identify as androgynous, though I'll go through periods of fluidity. I don't really care, though it seems that all of my boyish or gender neutral clothing is always dirty whenever I am feeling more manly, because Murphy's Law. I've never really found my neutral tendencies to be bothersome, though I have to admit there are times when I am acutely aware of not being female (which is my sex).

I took a gender neutral name, have a nice gender neutral online persona, have a gender neutral pseudonym for my writing...

Have breasts the size of cantaloupes... 

And therein lies my discomfort. I can look on a mirror and be perfectly happy... As long as I don't look below my shoulders. Tried a binder once, borrowed from a trans friend of mine. Did wonders for him, just gave me torpedo uniboob. I've since lost some weight, and thank gods I've lost some there, too... Not a lot, but enough that I notice. Thought about trying a binder again, but I'm too poor to buy one right now. Not sure I'm prepared to drop the cash on it with such a risk of failure is at hand... But I really, really hate my breasts. Always have.

Hnn...

The other bane of my existence is that no one seems to get it. I have a penchant for cute things... Also, as an artist, I am very keen on aesthetics. For some reason these things are associated with femininity, and thus have been used as evidence against me and my gender identity. ""You like X-girlie thing, so you're a woman."" What about the X-boy things I like, or the gender neuter things? Or the fact that my likes and dislikes don't actually dictate my gender identity? I have a hard time trying to explain it to people... I get frustrated, especially when they try to get out of it by way of, ""whatever you say (even though I still think you're mental).""

And I have no idea how to explain it to my mother, much less my father...

They call me by my given name, though, and I can't stand it. My parents gave me a very feminine (and annoyingly old fashioned) name, and it doesn't suit me. I figure if I could make them understand the need for my neutral name, perhaps I could get them to call me by it, but... They're old fashioned folk, and, as I said, I have no idea of how to explain it to them.

I work in a grocery store. A couple of months ago I got my hair cut in a very short, boyish style. The first time a little kid asked their mum if I was a boy or girl made me so happy. Oh, how I wish I could have told them I was neither, because I think the kids can get it much more easily. I like my job, though, so I kept my happiness quietly...

I dunno... Maybe I'm having more trouble getting used to this than I thought I was? I have no issues with myself, gender wise, but often when I'm around other people I feel like I can't be myself, because to them I'm being ""that girl.""

Or, that the time for you to go trans has passed and it's too late in your life to do such. 

I used to be pretty depressed, and a lot of the feelings were because I wish I had born as a girl. The thing that really burned me the hardest is the fact that it wasn't until age 18 that I began to feel like that, a lot, and by that point I felt as if it was too late. I did research on transgenderism and transsexuality, and read stories about people starting hormone therapy and lifestyle changes as kids or as teens. It really made me feel as if I had waited too late, because physically I had developed into a male and I feel as if there is no going back, and doubt I can pass. 

Being 24 now I just can't fathom the lifestyle change of transitioning. I only came out of depression recently and still can't get over the fact that I've missed out on a lot of my life because of that, and feel as I need to grab what I can (which is life as a male) and just go for it. I only have one shot at my 20s and I think transitioning now would be more than I could ever take on. 

So given that, you may say that in all honestly, I am cisgender. But how do I deal with the want of having been born a girl still plaguing me?

I wear jeans and sneakers and hoodies, don't wear makeup, don't shave body hair, and cut my hair myself whenever it gets long enough to annoy me (shoulder-lengthish). I do not wear dresses, I do not wear skirts, and when I was made to as a kid there was massive dysphoria. I'm okay with my body, but personalitywise I feel a lot more male than female.

After some begging from my friends, I agreed to come, which now means I have to deal with the whole fucking clothing saga again. I just want to have a good evening with my friends, wearing clothing I feel comfortable in that doesn't attract attention to me.

So far my suggested options are:

1. Don't go. This is my usual choice. It feels wrong that I should have to be excluded from this event because of being bad at gendernorms, and I won't get another chance.

2. Wear a dress. NO. NO. This will not happen, however supportive my female friends mean to be when they offer to help me shop for one.

3. Wear a tux, like the guys. I'm worried this would attract attention. I am out as bisexual, so maybe my friends would just think it was me being weird like that, but I don't think I could handle strangers staring at me. Apart from being terrified of this attention though, I would be comfortable with the clothing itself.

4. Wear a suitably formal jumpsuit. If I can find one that's non-awful enough (but still formal enough), I could maybe do this.

5. ???

So, I don't really know what I'm looking for here. Maybe just a vent.


Basically my issue is that while I've recently started identifying as genderqueer after a lifetime of not knowing there was a label for my weirdness. BUT- I am also ""blessed"" by my birth body, which I realistically admit is a gorgeous example of the tall, lean feminine figure. To boot, it naturally sits at a ""perfect"" weight of slender-with-curves, regardless of what I eat or do. Women every day ask me if they can borrow my figure and metabolism please.


I have a lovely body. It's extremely aesthetically appealing and were I not in it I'd find it very attractive. But it's not MY body, and it doesn't reflect the way I feel or think 95% of the time. I don't really want it and to be frank I don't like being in it much at all.


I'm carrying a lot of guilt about not wanting a body I know I'm privileged to have. Anyone got ideas for how I can either come to terms with or move past this? I also don't know what I DO want my body to look like, since every time I try to think about it I get caught in the mindfuck that is what society tells those of us who are FAAB that we should want to look like. How do I explore what I want to present as without saying a grand ""fuck you"" to women who sweat and bleed to look more like I already do?

I normally opt for a short buzz-cut to a professional male's haircut (dude, I dunno, I just go into the hair cutting place and ask for a man's haircut). I don't shave my legs or armpits, but I have such little hair that it is hard to notice my legs as having hair at all, and wearing shirts that show the armpit will just as readily show the boobs to a severe degree. I will often wear tight-fitting undershirts, but again, with the size of my breasts, they end up looking like regular-sized large ones, instead of ridiculous-sized large ones.

I have moderately muscular arms and legs, but not enough to be considered masculine on their own. Bulking in the shoulders might make me look more awkward than masculine....but I'm up for trying it.

Also coming out to parents on Saturday.  How do I help them through this process in a reasonable kind of way?

I dated a woman, let's call her ""Jay,"" for almost two years and we broke up just under 2 years ago.  During our relationship, she was always pretty touchy about my gender presentation.  Even liking something that was colored pink caused her to freak out a bit.  

I started coming out about a month ago and I planned on waiting until next week when I'd be a bit more comfortable with everything and I'd be done with graduation etc.  I'll spare the details, but she ended up finding out from her old boss (who manages the concert hall on campus--who I know, but speak to very rarely) via e-mail.

This was all a day or two ago but Jay and I actually spoke about it tonight.  Understandably, she's pretty worked up about it.  I can sympathize and empathize with the confusion and mixed feelings, and I want to make things as easy as possible for her.  My real problem is that she seems to be jumping to a lot of conclusions, namely that parts or all of my feelings for her/our relationship were fake in one way or another.  This is absolutely not the case. 

She kept turning things around on me.  It seemed like she wasn't sure what she wanted to say or ask at the beginning, so I said to her that none of this changes how I felt about her etc. and then she chastised me for being presumptuous.  She was condescending and saying things like ""you need to understand how this affects other people, you need to help them through it.""  I  totally acknowledge that this is true, and it's something I""m trying to do.  Right now, though, I've been drowning in school work, I'm a 5th year and prone to long periods of hole-up-in-my-room-for-weeks depression, so I don't really have close friends here.  I haven't told my parents yet (but I do on Saturday. huzzah!), and I've only been at this a month. 

I've been thinking about my family too.  They're very accepting people, but there's going to be some hard emotions and a sense of loss for them, I know. 

I want to be as supportive and helpful as I can for people, but I don't think I should have to hold their hand through it.  I mean, this is a lot harder for me than anyone else. If anything, shouldn't there be people holding my hand?  I mean, I'm holding it together, but it's taking all I've got.    

Any suggestions on how to prepare?

Basically, I was born a female (age 15), but I've always maintained a sort-of tomboyish identity my entire life. I liked sports &amp; video games, hated dresses, but loved both dolls and action figures. Stereotypical stuff like that.

A couple of years ago, I started questioning my gender. I dressed really masculine, because I wanted to conceal how my body was developing. I hated growing breasts, and hips, and getting my period. I hated being a girl, basically. Sometimes when I was in public, people would assume that I was male, and at restaurants and such, would call me sir. I didn't mind, and I'd even introduce myself as a boy to people that I knew I'd never interact with again.

People in my life, specifically members of my grandmother's church, didn't like that. They would constantly complain to my family about how I expressed myself, judge, even hold prayers for me at church. I wasn't directly involved in this, because I had renounced my Christianity, but my grandma hated it. This was also around the time that I realized that I was bisexual, so I decided to just fake it, and embrace my feminine side.

I'm used to being a cisfemale now, but I'm beginning to question myself again. Something that triggered this is when I was reading about a trans*male's experience, he was gay, and said that while a girl, he was attracted to guys in a gay way. 

That's how I find myself attracted to guys. I'm attracted to them in a gay sort of way, and with girls, I'm attracted to them in a more straight sort of way. I don't really know how to describe it, it's just a relationship dynamic thing.

Another element to it, I have multiple kind of ""personalities"" that come out at certain times. Their identities are a gay male, asexual male, and lesbian female. I'm guessing that may have something to do with my confusion. They were bred of an episode of psychosis and loneliness.

Any advice on what to do?

TL;DR  I'm currently a bisexual cisfemale, has always questioned my gender and had to choose because of constant judgement. I don't feel completely comfortable in my own body, but I'm used to being female. Mental illness may be effecting my gender identity. In relationships, I prefer dynamic of a bisexual male, but my gender feels separated from that. Sorry if it's confusing.

She looked at me for a few seconds, visibly trying to work something out, and she then asked me ""so what pronoun should use? Should I use ""X""? I don't want to offend you or anything.

I replied with ""I'm not bothered with pronouns to be honest. Just call me whatever. He, she, X. I don't really care.""

This then left her looking extremely confused, and she eventually asked ""Why don't you use pronouns?""

I replied ""I don't want to make everyone scared about the possibility of offending me. As with you, you weren't sure, and I don't want to make anybody I know feel uncomfortable or to change the way they are.

One example is that I've been mentioning how little I like the word daughter. I haven't made any demands, I've made some suggestions, and this has turned into Mum's go-to issue.

I feel really lost.,notquitemale,15,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1c3wwg/new_perspectives_on_gender_have_lead_me_to/,"20/maab here... while I've had identity issues and self-esteem problems all throughout my life, I've never really seen my gender as an issue. In the last couple years, I finally accepted my sexuality as bi, and very recently as pan. Recently, I've been exposed very strongly to the trans* community; my sister came out to me as trans shortly after I came out to the family as bi, and an old friend I've reconnected with told me she was trans as well, and we've been dating for the last couple months (which has been amazing, and she may or may not see this and know who this is). 

About a week ago, I had trouble sleeping... for some reason gender identity was simply on my mind. With my new, personal connections to the community, I brought myself up to speed in trans issues, and sex/gender concepts. At first, I found it interesting in a very scientific sense. But for some reason, I started looking inward... and I'm not really sure how I feel. Still male to a great degree? Definitely. I like being strong and athletic, doing hard labor and being a man in bed. But... I don't feel overly attached to the label. I *love* the androgynous look, and I've been messing around in the mirror... occasionally I'll catch an angle or a glimpse that looks just... awesome. I'll once in a while catch this semi-vulnerable, feminine glance... and it just feels really right.

...and this all scares the shit out of me. I've had no real issue being male... but since learning about non-binary identities... they feel right in a way. I had a couple moments today where I was sitting alone, and I felt comfortable truly identifying as genderqueer... but they lasted all of 5 mins, and every other second has been filled with questioning. In a way, I don't feel like it's legitimate questioning due to how late it is in life and how comfortable I've always been being cis. Then I have moments where the idea of being an average, cis male almost disgusts me...

I just don't even know. I sure as hell don't want any of this. I just got comfortable with my sexuality, and just started meeting and dating some wonderful people. Now this... I all at once feel frustrated that gender even matters... then scared at the idea of questioning it... then happy at following who I really want to be... then sad and angry that I can't just be ""normal"". I know I'll always have a few people there for me, no matter who I find myself being. But this is a lot to think about... and either way, I can't wait to see my gf on friday to paint my nails for the first time \^_^

I don't think I'm looking for advice or anything really, I just needed a good space to vent. Thanks for reading if you made it this far :)

I have a vagina and I'm all about it, but when I was younger I briefly wanted to be a boy. I played with my brothers' toys (I only have brothers, 3 of them), I preferred to play with boys, I asked for boy toys for christmas on a couple occasions, I went through a phase in middle school where I dressed like a boy, in high school I watched dragonball z, various kung-fu movies, listened to metal/rock (korn, slipknot) drew and played video games and hung out with the grungy neighborhood skaterish guys. I love football (RGIII!) and have held traditionally male jobs (software developer, now a park ranger). All of this of course is in addition to doing girly things too. I had barbies and baby dolls and later hello kitty and all that good stuff too but I was never big on dresses or heels and makeup. I had the best of both worlds.
I have always been attracted to masculine guys but I'm getting married in a couple weeks to an effeminate guy who has been assumed gay in the past. Our story is worthy of a whole 'nother post but the point is there's even role reversal in my relationship.
I have never been bothered by the fact I'm female, only by people's reactions to it. I don't understand why it is so odd for a girl to want an rc car for christmas or for a girl to do boy things. The focus has never been ""why am I so weird"" but ""why are other girls so weird."" I guess I don't really experience gender dysphoria, most of the time I was worried about not being physically girly enough (small boobs, no hips). 
I have had crushes on girls but no sexual desires for women. I do feel like I ""think like a man"" 80-90% of the time. 
So my question to all of you is, am I just a tomboy? Is gender dysphoria necessary to label oneself as genderqueer? Are all tomboys genderqueer? I am not looking to label myself, I am comfortable identifying as a female, but I feel like this is a very blurry area. Or maybe I am like a cat that thinks he's dog; this is the only normal I know.

There's been a lot of times when I've been down because of life, depression, gender disphoria, etc and I've wanted to talk with likeminded peers. There's communities, forums, chatrooms, etc, for teens and for GQ/transgender, but, even after a lot of searching, I didn't really feel like I found what I was looking for, so I have some questions.

*How old are you all? Are there many other young GQ/TG/queer people that don't feel like they have a community that really fits them?

*Is there a queer teen community that has a good amount of GQ folks? I'm sorry if this sounds rude and it's nothing against any communities like this, but most LGBT places I've gone to seemed too... mainstream? They're great places, but a 'normal' LGBT place just doesn't seem to work for me.

*Is there interest in a community for teen/college age queer/GQ if there isn't a good one out there I'm missing? I'm not trying to reinvent the wheel if there are fitting places already, but if there aren't, I'd be interested in helping to start such a community. Forums + chatroom + resources would be great.

As a GQ/etc teen, it sucks that I can find a good teen community that doesn't understand being queer, or a good queer community that is full of adults who only care about adult issues, but I don't feel like I have access to anyone who is really 'like me'. I'm just tired of feeling alone, and if there's other young queers out there who feel the same, I'd like to help.

I am trying to get 1,000 people to complete a survey I've designed.

I already have several hundred but I'm not happy with the sample's diversity. Right now almost everyone is cis-gendered and 86% identify as straight. I'd love to get a lot of trans-gender, gender non-conforming voices in the mix. (You might notice the queer-dog-whistle of the colors I chose for the survey).

This survey is part of a larger project I am doing which is investigating some cultural reasons why so many of us are trying hard to create the life we want, yet we still don't feel great about ourselves or parts of our lives.

I would be so very grateful if you would maybe take this TOTALLY ANONYMOUS survey and then pass it along to others. It takes less than 10 minutes. Did I mention it's ANONYMOUS? Did I mention I would love more gender diversity?

I am not making any money off of this project. I am doing it on my own time outside of work (I was trained to do research). Also, I created this account specifically to get the word about about this survey. So no karma whoring here. Maybe upvote for visibility?

Though you are the first people I'm telling, and even though you don't know me, I'm glad someone knows. I feel... well, in a closet, I guess. I don't think I ever understood that expression until recently. I've been alienating myself from everyone (though it feels the other way around) over the last six months or so--now I spend most of my time alone if I'm not in class--and I don't know if telling people will make them more likely to want to be around me or if I'm the one who is afraid to be around them.

I also want to say that I'm in a happy, long-term relationship with a guy I love more than I can express in words, and I don't think he'll care, but I don't want to tell him, because I know it won't change anything. And I really don't want it to change anything. I realize that this is contradictory--so is everything in my life right now.

This past year, I've begun transitioning. I started using a new name and gender-neutral pronouns. I bind and pack when I feel like it. Unfortunately, I can't find work so when my last contract was over I moved back in with my parents. I'm in my late twenties.

As an Italian-American, I'm naturally more hairy than other FAAB folk. My mother 'taught' me to deal with this at twelve by taking me to a nail salon to wax my eyebrows and facial hair. As part of my transition, I've let my brows grow in and have taken to shaving my facial hair. My mother will not let the eyebrow thing go. She insists on taking me to the nail salon to get them waxed. I've tried telling her that I don't want to go. When she asks why not, I don't have an answer for her because I'm not ready to come out to her yet. Every few days, she whines about my eyebrows. I've tried deflecting her, but it always starts up again. 

Lately, she's kicked it up a notch by begging my femme friends to pluck them for me whenever they come over. This really makes my friends very uncomfortable since they are fully supportive of me. She also will order me to put my jacket on when she comes home to go get them done, as if I am a child. When I refuse, she asks why I'm being difficult 'like a teenager.'

Any ideas to get her to leave me alone? I can't believe I have to do this at my age.

For instance, I'm a transsexual female, but I think of myself as androgyne femme.

This has only been my experience, but those I encounter who use ""genderqueer"" as a primary descriptor have tended to be doing so politically, i.e. they use it to express their intentionality behind queering society's gender norms (often in a feminist context), not necessarily as a gender identity unto itself. Those who assert an identity have tended to have a more specific term they prefer when giving a name to their gender identity. 

Those I meet who use genderqueer as their primary identity have tended to be CAFAB. CAMAB (specifically non-transsexual) people who ""fit"" the common understanding of genderqueer have been quick to label themselves in other ways: sissy, faerie, male femme, prettyboy, and some even have taken on metrosexual as a sepcific gender identity. I have my suspicions on why CAMAB people and CAFAB people have such different representation, but I wanted to hear from you all.

I tend to be very masculine most of the time but I have frequent times my life almost weekly where I feel like I am a woman and just am very feminine with my behavior, dress, feeling the need to shave more of my body than normal, etc. I don't cross-dress but that is due to money and not being able to afford a new wardrobe.

 For many years I thought I should have been a woman and considered getting surgery but I now know this is not the case and would have been a mistake. None of this bothers me but I see terms like gender-queer, gender-fluid, and many others and I am trying to understand which would apply to me?

 As for sexual orientation, I identify as pansexual and some pansexuals say I am ""gender-blind"" but I was under the impression that had to do with the gender/s I am attracted to which then that would be accurate.

First of all, a bit about myself. I'm MAAB, and I identify as genderqueer. Initially, this was because I felt genderfluid and I preferred to use an umbrella term to describe myself. However, I've realised that when I'm not in an environment with lots of social interaction (such as school), I feel as though gender doesn't exist. It just doesn't manifest itself in any form.


This led me on to thinking that gender is a social construct, but this isn't the case, as I've had mild gender dysphoria before. Instead I started to look at what it means to be a man or a woman (excluding sex), and I can't bring up any concrete answers. The only answers I can think of are that they are terms to define how people act socially in relation to masculinity and femininity.


What I want to know is:

* what is gender without masculinity and femininity?
* what does it mean to be male or female (excluding sex)?
* are there other things than masculinity and femininity?

The problem is that though he might be willing to date me as I am now, he might want to distance himself or break up with me once I get further into my transition. The idea that he'd be willing to date me as a female, but not date me, the same person, if my body were more in-between sexes, kinda weirds me out. Frankly, it seems pretty shallow. I've considered talking to him about it, but I don't know how to bring it up, or if it's a talk we should have before or after I ask him out?

I am a 21 year old born a girl. When I was eleven I was going to go to another school and really, really wanted to go as a boy. I never fit in with girls (or, for the matter, anyone, ha.) I never did girly things. Never did barbies, tree houses instead.

I thought it was nothing for a while; just kept on being my own self. Kinda weird, didn't fit in, did my own thing.

Now I'm almost 22 and I think that I might be experiencing actual dysphoria. I hate the fact that I have big hips and boobs. I'm pretty tall and lanky, and I used to be really skinny... and since I dress in pretty androgynous clothing (usually a button down shirt and skinny jeans) when I was skinny I was mistaken for a boy a lot. 

Half of the time I feel more like a gay boy than a straight girl. I think that I'd rather be a boy, and I really don't like that I have the attributes that I do. 

However, I don't buy into gender binaries. If I really am a boy at heart, I am a really feminine one. I do like to wear dresses on occasion. Maybe once or twice a year. But most of the time, it's short hair, flannel shirt, skinny jeans, boy shoes. 

I'm really quite okay with the way that I present myself. I like who I am. I kinda hate my body, though. 

I have been in a relationship with a boy for a year and half now. I'll admit that a part of the reason why I like him is because he's never fit the ""masculine"" norm - he has a bit of a high voice, he cares about his looks, he even has a big crush on a male celebrity or two... I've always felt that we work so well together because I am a masculine girl and he is a feminine boy. The only other boy I loved, actually, thought that he was gay but decided that he was bisexual. Or pansexual. I dunno. 

I still don't often make friends with girls. I prefer boys, but mostly if they're gay or if they're in any way... not completely masculine. 

I really do think that I am not the identity I currently use. I am not a girl. I'm not a boy, either. I've never had anyone (or any internet thing) to talk about this to before. I'd really appreciate some input, even if it's just some validation. I had a roommate once who was FTM but later decided he felt more androgynous... but we never breached to my situation. 

I really, really want to bring this situation up to my SO. I am already working on losing the weight I gained that makes me look so feminine. I want to buy a binder, too, though, which is obviously something he will notice. I have brought it up in hints but nothing that warrants a real reply. Once in reply to an assertion that I like spooning him rather than vice versa he did say that it would be better for him if I had a penis, but I couldn't tell if he was joking. Ugh.

I have been struggling so much trying to determine which gender identity I fit under specifically.

I know I fit under terms non-binary/genderqueer but I was hoping to narrow it down possibly.

I am biologically male

I have no interest in transitioning as I am usually comfortable with my body. On the days that I am not, I wish I wasn't male but I don't want to be female.

I see myself as feminine but NOT female

Out of convenience and some necessity I present as male (not masculine)

Aside from outward appearances, I do NOT see myself as male in any way

I value gender neutrality in communication as my chosen name (soon to be legal) is neutral as are my pronouns.

I have tried to figure this out on my own. From other people I have asked elsewhere, I keep getting told I am maybe bigender or genderfluid but everything I see about what those are just seems wrong for me. Neutrois sounded plausible or gender-neutral as an identity. If I could choose what I ""wanted"" to be, it would be a neutral gender. Otherwise, right now I really have no clue.

Can anyone help with this? And while I know I do not need a label, I feel it is something I would feel better knowing.

I have a stereotypically fit/muscular male body and am fairly attractive in a ""cute"" way rather than a sexy masculine way, ie. I have a young looking face.  I used to be self-conscious about this despite also feeling good that I was attractive in someway.  It took me forever to realize that people actually thought I was attractive, basically I only gained confidence in my looks the past 1.5 years.  






**Now** I am the opposite, I am very happy that I have very little facial hair and body hair because I think androgyny is especially beautiful despite being able to recognize beauty in binary forms as well.  When I see androgynous guys (not fem ""fabulous"" gay guys, but more like guys you could actually mistake for the opposite sex due to potentially make up, hairstyle, and clothing style) I want to be like them and I basically develop crushes because I want them to tell me their secrets of how to live life that way to be honest.  











**I** am basically bored/frustrated (not dysphoric) with my masculine look and feel it doesn't fit me.  Masculine mannerisms don't really fit me all that well either, meaning I don't want to have to be ""the man"" in any specific scenario, I would rather just be me and if that means someone who is more submissive and feminine then I want that to be ok.  I have been dealing with a lot of frustration because I feel lesser than other guys who are super alpha male (feeling jealous that they can comfortably identify that way and I can't) but I also realize that I fucking HATE that attitude/way of presenting yourself.  I figure I am mostly frustrated because I associate that attitude with confidence and success.  I hate it but am ashamed that I can't emulate it and therefore will always be a failure in some way (despite succeeding in almost everything in my life due to a great family and parents).











**I** feel dumb for suddenly wanting to dive into all this feminine stuff now, like why didn't I do it earlier in life if any of it will really make me happier and more secure with my identity (is it just that I have finally gone over the deep end with my porn fetishes?)?  I didn't have a bunch of girlfriends growing up, in fact virtually all my friends have been male and only recently have I developed significant friendships with girls.  I liked sports as long as I didn't have to be overly aggressive which meant that despite my athleticism I could just not get my shit together for football and wrestling (why I wasted my time on that stuff instead of other things like gender modification that are interesting to me now I will never know, ok I liked the fit body it gave me and I was a huge conformist) But I am going to experiment and stop worrying if what I do is masculine or feminine and just be me.




**As** for sex: I have only had a few partners, 2 guys and 1 girl.  I am potentially addicted to porn and fantasy (my orgasms from it are much stronger than with partners, but I haven't been with someone who I was TRULY attracted to on an emotional and physical level yet) which is probably at this point 75% trans or cd, 10% lesbian, 15% gay.  I am not even sure what is a fetish and what is more normal anymore but I suppose it doesn't matter all that much because its a part of me either way.  




**I** used to think that I was fantasizing about being the dominant one when viewing these things, but I now I realize that I fantasize about being the submissive one 95% of the time.  I basically imagine myself in the feminine role, but I am not sure if its because the tabooness of being emasculated is turning me on or if its that I just like the idea of giving up my masculinity to someone else and embracing whatever is left with them.




**I** don't really feel like I fit in with gay dudes that well because two dudes getting it on is not hot to be me unless there is major differences in femininity and masculinity between the two partners which could be represented with big age differences or with one person representing and dressing femininely.  I used to feel super ashamed for wanting to be in this role sexually, but recently I have been like fuck it, I am going to just follow my desires.  I like forced fem stuff as well.  I have never cross-dressed and don't have a specific urge to, but I do want to explore how feminine I can make my face and potentially fem up my clothes a little in terms of fit and style.




**But** lets say I grow my hair out and thin my frame up and learn how to feminize my face ect.  My career goal is not a fucking fashion photographer or owner of ""insert random hip store/item line"" or an artist or even someone who gets by on low wage jobs where people don't give a shit what you look like.  I want to be in healthcare, specifically I want to be a dentist.  How am I suppose to develop a patient base and relate to them when the vast majority of society still thinks anyone who doesn't fit into gender roles is ""weird"" and therefore lesser.  What if changing myself gets me rejected from the interviews or I can't even attract patients because my appearance is to non-normative.  There doubts are weighing heavily on my mind at the moment.  



**Either** way I will DEFINITELY explore this interest of mine.  If it turns out to be more of a passing curiosity or just a form of sexual fulfillment (maybe I am just a fem gay boy in denial, even though I am already out as queer) then I can probably just compartimentalize it, but if it turns out I really like presenting myself this way it could lead to problems in the future.  I have an aggressive social side to me at times but generally I don't deal with criticism or bullying well at all (I have always blended in and didn't have to grow a thick skin basically) and am afraid of running away like a little bitch if anyone attacks me (or even mentions that I am weird) for representing differently.

Personal stories and advice welcome.,Rooblies,12,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/17rw1i/anyone_else_out_there_with_body_image_issues_that/,"When I was growing up, I detested the idea of becoming a ""woman."" I couldn't figure out why everyone spoke of it so highly. I was always a tomboy as a child. Around 11 years old, my breasts and hips started to grow. 

I wore sports bras that were too small to flatten my chest. I developed an eating disorder with the hopes my hips and breasts would stop growing. When I got my period at 13, I went into a suicidal depression for several weeks. 

By the time I started high school, I was 98 pounds. My hips and breasts kept growing. I could no longer fit into my tiny size zero jeans. I was absolutely disgusted with myself. I gained over 20 pounds within a few months due to being underweight and going through puberty despite running track every day and barely eating.

The thought of what my body was turning into made me want to throw up. Instead of the genderless, carefree kid I used to be, I was now turning into something that made me very obviously female, and these changes were only good for one thing: making babies (yuck!). I made my decision to never have my own kids well before I hit puberty. The thought of myself being pregnant and childbirth in general makes me want to vomit. 

I am 24 years old, but the realization that I did not have to identify with a specific gender did not come until a couple years ago. I had been dieting and exercising compulsively for nearly a decade because I thought I wanted to be thin (because I thought that's what would make me attractive), and then I realized recently that I had been doing it (subconsciously) with the false hopes of shrinking the fat in my hips and breasts so I would come off as more androgynous. 

Within the last year or so, I've worn sports bras 90% of the time. I go through girl phases and boy phases, but I also have phases when I want to be both, and when I want to be neither. Sometimes I have drag queen days where I dress over-the-top and feminine. Most people don't see me as a drag queen since I'm already a female, but that's how I feel on the inside so I don't really care what people think. There is no determination for what type of day I will have when I wake up or how long it will last.

Since I have some serious body dysmorphia, I have ""fat"" days and ""skinny"" days (those who have had eating disorders will probably understand that better). For a while, I had been wondering if my ""fat"" days corresponded with my masculine days and my ""skinny"" days corresponded with my feminine days since I felt more comfortable wearing tight fitting clothes on my skinny days. 

Recently I've realized that though they might be very loosely related, more than I thought. Yesterday was a ""skinny"" day. It also happened to be a somewhat masculine day. I wore skinny jeans, my boyfriend's t-shirt, sneakers, and a bandanna to hold my hair back (it's slightly shorter than shoulder length). I felt like a sexy, genderbending punk rocker and it felt so good. It was a good day.

I'm still going through a lot of self discovery and dealing with my eating issues every day. I have learned a lot about myself. Sometimes my body dysmorphia affects my gender presentation and sometimes it doesn't. 

I don't think I'll ever be truly happy with my body because it's still too curvy (meaning size of breasts and hips) for my liking even on my most feminine days. I really like being female, but I still think my breasts and hips should be smaller. Sometimes I feel like my body is a parody of a woman... the size of my breasts and hips in relation to my stature is almost comical, a gross exaggeration meant to be paraded around like a sexual object at some kind of sexual freak show.

",deadronin,13,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/17nr3e/the_problem_with_being_a_maab_androgyne_that_is/,"Wall of text.  So the other day I jokingly said ""I just want a girl to come and make me feel like a natural woman"" then immediately realized it was absolutely true.  I am fine with having a male body, but I'm an androgyne, I feel like I'm both male and female on the inside, probably a little more toward the female side.  Since it's not super possible to have a body that is both in the way that I would want I am fine with having a male body, but it makes me feel all the more feminine on the inside, perhaps to compensate.  

What this all leads to is I feel like I'm a lesbian in that I'm attracted to women and feel like a woman in many romantic ways, but the straight women I have been with have always been missing a certain je ne sais quoi that makes me feel like they are really seeing me as I am and not just a man who sometimes puts on a skirt.  I've discussed this on here with someone before, but it's been weighing on my mind a lot lately.  Not sure how to find a girly girl who likes my particular blend of gender.

The more I have uncovered, the more that has unraveled and I accept that it will be a long process to put everything back together.

Biologically, I am female, kept me in dresses and bangs until puberty hit.  Yet even then I had no definite grasp on myself or what I liked and disliked.  Coming to terms with my sexual attraction was one thing.  I identify as lesbian now because I am still viewed as female and it just makes things easier that way when it comes to explanations.  It's the other thing, the fence between masculinity and femininity, the one that I straddle daily and still don't quite understand about myself.  

I wrote about it.  Once.  The feeling.  The thoughts of it.   Since I really know no other way to express myself, I'll share it here:

""*As I write this, I feel their stares on the back of my head.  They are more curious than anything as of late and I do not blame them.  I am shifting and they have noticed that the ground around me becomes increasingly like sand.  Pretty soon we will all be washed out to sea and I seem to not care.*  

*They try to tether me but I shrug the binds off.  I smirk.  This is what I want, to be swept away and there is nothing to stop it.  Whatever lies beyond my understanding draws me in.  I want to be caught up in the sway, I want to be drenched in the unknown.*

*My dreams are harder to wake from these days.  Honestly, they are closer to memories and I cling to the afterthoughts like a child afraid of the monsters that lie outside of covers.  I wake and all I can wonder is who am I.  What is this body and why does this mind both reject and accept the fleshy confines.  Who am I to question such things.*

*I wish it didn't bother me, the wondering, but I cannot help this human trait.  I cannot help but to be absolutely bothered by my own existence.  Nothing makes sense and they just keep watching, waiting for me to make a move.  Pick a side.  I don't know where I belong though and that is the most troubling thing about this.*

*x &amp; y*
*They are just letters and yet they are much more than that.*  
*Am I much more than that?*""





I guess the real point of this post is.. I just tire of feeling lonely and isolated because I can't connect to myself let alone another.  All I really want is to find out who I am or at least know why I haven't yet.

Sorry for the rambling nature of this post. I get really nervous when I post online about this sort of thing. 

I really need help with identifying myself. First off, I am a 24 year old male.

I would say when I was about 14 years old I began to fantasize about being turned into a woman. I researched and was under the belief I was a transsexual for years and years. However, throughout those years I would have phases where I never even thought about being female.  I planned all throughout my lower years of university to transition to a female. 

I met my SO 3 years ago. She is wonderful and dating her pretty much made my desire to be female disappear. She doesn't know about any of this nor do I plan on telling her. 

I get in these moods where all I can think about is being female. Then I get into moods where I don't think about being female for weeks.  I try to battle that by playing games online exclusively as female and posting on sports and gaming forums as female. It helps... sometimes. 

Anyway, I stumbled upon this subreddit and found out about dualgender, bigender, fluidgender. Can anyone highlight what you believe I described?  It really has opened up my life since I discovered this stuff a few weeks ago. Because I always thought I was just pushing the feminine desires away because it would be too hard or difficult. 

But if I can learn how to embrace both genders than I believe I could live a lot happier life.

Thanks for reading.

I think noticed a page about the ""COGIATI"" which I know doesn't need to be taken super seriously, but when I took it I got exactly 0, right in the middle of androgyne.

So the thought has been there to start to more accurately reflect this, but I'm pretty new to the concept. I don't want to over-femme myself, cause that would certainly make me uncomfortable, but I also don't want it to be so obvious I'm male.

I talked about this with a friend, but all he did was tell me the side effects of anything I mentioned might help, but not things I necessarily want to do.

I guess, the easiest way to explain it is that I wish I was a hermaphrodite.  Instead, I'm female, genderfluid and, to put it simply, pansexual.  I'm sick of my female body, but the desire to be FtM isn't strong enough to seriously or jokingly consider it, especially since bottom surgery can't create functioning parts, it wouldn't be worth it to me.  Plus, I like my ladyparts, they're fun, top and bottom.  I just really wish I could experience both worlds at once.  Unfortunately, if my body matched my brain I can't even *imagine* what would happen to my relationships with others, sexually or platonically.

I feel most dysphoric when it's ""that time of the month"" whatever you want to call it, shark week I don't care.  But I don't want to get on birth control to stop it.  The potential feminizing effects are too much for me, not to mention the other side effects like weight gain and loss of libido, plus I've heard it can be unhealthy.  It's unfortunate that taking enough testosterone to do what I want also has similar side effects, plus seems to be potentially more harmful, because I would rather deal with becoming more masculine than feminine.

This is the first time I've felt so dysphoric, and I'm kind of hoping it's just a one-off time.  The worst part is that even though I want to stop menstruating, I'd be paranoid all the time that I was pregnant and I think knowing I'm not is worth more to me than not bleeding.  I wish I wasn't so young and that I didn't want to someday have kids, because then something like a hysterectomy might be an option, but it's not.

This is just an alt account that I'm posting from because I'm still a bit embarrassed about this.  I'm a 27 year old biologically male homosexual.  I'm generally happy being a man.  I guess by that I mean I wouldn't trade my penis for anything.

But at the same time, since I was young (12-13), I have always felt that some part of me was a bit ""girly"".  I always felt comfortable around girls and talking about girly stuff.  There was never, and is still never any sexual attraction to ladies.  Also, as far a sexual matters go, I'm exclusively passive when it comes to sex.  I'd generally say I like the more feminine roles I guess.  

When I hit puberty, things started to get way weirder.  On top of being sexually attracted to men, some...strange things started to happen to my body.  First of all, I grew breasts.  They ended up being large As/small Bs.  After getting checked by a doctor, mainly because of being embarrassed and confused about being a guy with boobs, they were definitely breast tissue and not a product of being overweight (which I never was).  Another thing is that I never really grew any body hair.  I have some very sparce hair on my arms and legs, but that's it aside from pubic hair.  Suffice to say, this has been a source embarassment and confusion at times.

All of this has recently come to a head for me since I've come out as gay a year and a half ago.  Since I've come to terms with my sexual orientation, now I've become concerned with my gender identity.  Very recently I've begun to embrace my femininity for the first time.  I've been buying some women's shirts/pants and so on.  I also got an androgynous haircut.  I'm still a bit afraid of wearing the clothes out in public, but I have been at home.

I dunno, I feel like I've been making progress, but I'm still *very* confused.  It's just that it always feels like some part of me is hiding at any given point.  Generally this isn't a big huge concern, but it really bothers me when I think about getting into a relationship that whoever I'm with will feel decieved if they meet me as more masculine and discover that I have a really huge feminine side.  Or if they meet me when I'm more feminine, they won't be interested in me because I'm not masculine enough.  I'd really like to know how other people deal with problems like this.  

I'm sorry for rambling, but this is the first time that I've ever really come out and said any of this stuff to anyone.  But it feels good to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Part One: The Road Less Travelled By

If I could go back nothing would change. It’s funny how the thorns that has dug into my emotional state for so long could be attached to flowers so precious, so beautiful, I’d gladly experience the pain again, no matter how great the feeling of a smooth life of it would be. But perhaps troubles create preciousness? If abnormal were normal, and normal is the worst punishment of all, should I ever really want my “abnormal” to conform to something I’ve so often thought of as a shallow disguise to fit in with an ever changing flow because “difference is scary” in the “everyone else is doing it” generation.

But it’s not a generation is it? Thousands of years of an ever changing cut and paste. Everything’s changing except what we want, and what we want is the status quo of what we understand, because majority rules, and the majority calls for oppression. Hiding behind a veil of “progressiveness” just because you treat one group slightly less like the dirt you wiped off your shoe. Equal rights are oppression of the majority, but excusing their faults cause ours are more grave. Love isn’t love anymore, love is a conditional response, and I haven’t fulfilled the requirements.

I tried to fill these conditions once. I submitted my claim, but time said no, and I was cast back into a searching tunnel with no flashlight. But when I find a little glimpse of light, I can’t follow it because our lights don’t “complement” each other. Because no one cares if it leads to the destination because my path isn’t the “right one.” I think Robert Frost had the right idea in that road less travelled by.

The path is rough, and the world throws rocks at the travelers. High school opened the door to it, but it slammed behind me. I never felt the path was wrong, but I knew as soon as I went through the arch I knew what I was going to leave behind. And so we’ve come full circle, because I tried my best to love, but did those I love do it back of their own accord or another condition? And once the door closed, the fear set in, that I broke the contract and lost it all, because my conditions were no longer met. So enough of the allegories, because this isn’t a veil, this is my reality. A reality where there’s no conditions, and the word “gender” means nothing but an arbitrary label of preference.

Part 2: A Monster Called Gender

Who could’ve forseen the irony of where it’d all begin? Under the watchful eye of those that would condemn me, my life changed instantly. His name is not important, but his presence was the only catalyst that mattered. In a world where everyone told me that it was wrong, it was the only thing at the moment that felt right. All I was taught was fear and pain and unquestioning obedience, but the moment with him was an oasis, no different than any moment I felt with a she. And the only thing that had felt so right in so long, brought forth the terrible realization of a world that’s so wrong.

Now let me make it clear, make no mistake, not once did I feel conviction for my path. But those that were the closest to me, or were they ever really close? Could I ever truly be close to those that would be the first to condemn the feelings of intuition. It was a fear, a fear so great that it clawed at the edges of my mind, screaming to be let out, yet it screamed in silence as I droned about school life. Being a “good Christian boy” during the day time, keeping the monster in quiet submission as I was taught to lead unquestioningly, because questioning was only a fast-track to damnation. And yet at night I could drop the façade, and meet up with him, feeling a sincere and innocent embrace that felt as though the monster of my fear were not just silence, it was a metamorphosis. The same thoughts in a different lens, where gender meant nothing, where even I could escape the cold gripping hands of the roles I was so often enduring.

But the transformation was just a temporary solution, and it returned in the day. Every day it grew stronger like a poison spreading through the veins of my thoughts. And like a ripping wound the pain grew and festered, until one day it punctured my heart. And the breeze was cold. A moment that cannot be written so eloquent, as would ruin its justice. For this was the most ineloquent and destructive, yet powerful and saving moment of my life. 

The breeze was cool, and search for no poetical language, what I say now is as literal as anything.  The window sill was large enough to seat me comfortable, but there was no comfort in any part of this moment. The ledge I sat on quickly began to feel like a lifting slope, threatening to slide me into the depths of the concrete below. But I was my own catalyst, and what I had grown to believe was the biggest threat of all. But could this be it? I stared down 5 stories and realized that the end I so bitterly sought, wasn’t what I sought at all. What I sought was an end, an end to gender. And the trip began slowly, painfully, and with much resistance, but I’ve learned so much, on how to live without it.

Part 3: Genderqueer?

It’s amazing how long something can hide. Feelings so ingrained from the beginning that I could remember, that I didn’t belong. “Boy” “son” “one of the guys” “dude” like mismatched labels being forced into the hole that didn’t fit. And yet why was I so often called it? Always being told what I should like, and what I should do.  Cars, workouts, and sports, as though there were a mold to fit everyone. And yet I was told there was only black and white, two opposites, the boy and girl. But with only two hemispheres, why did I feel like I didn’t fit on the map? It was as though black and white were all the same shade of grey. 

Is this why I couldn’t belong? Who could I tell? All my feelings cast aside in the name of redemption? And yet mind and body in a mismatch by the coercion of everything I had been taught. A match for positive and negative, but is love really all you need, when the one you love is a forbidden shade? In an ever changing test of loves endurance, harder by the minute, rewarding by the second.

Years have passed reversing through the window that almost closed the book. So much has changed, like a new lens fixed into my perception. Suddenly a black and white world so full of color. And suddenly I realize perhaps my love is not colorblind, but the love of all color, the ability to come close to the inherent preciousness of every color. And yet one has caught my eye, no not one color, but one person so precious, every color shines through. A love that colors could intertwine, a mixture of pure joy and innocence. And yet there was a color missing. In a world so full of color, could I still only see my shade of grey?

And yet I could never have forseen the liberator of my own colorless feelings. The kindness of a stranger, found through a simple connection of having left behind the same vice grip of condemnation. Pushing myself out of my shell, to see what I could truly be. It wasn’t a big store, but it had exactly what was needed to get a glimpse of the color hiding underneath the façade forced upon me from an assigned birth. 

Sizes too small, sizes too big, breaking the binary was hard to calculate. And yet it was such a wonderful time. Outfits of color, dropping the forced idea of masculinity, and yet feeling no femininity, but only me. Knowing full well I could be called “fag” “drag queen” and other useless empty words from the closed mind of indoctrination. But for those brief moments, full of laughter and blushing, skirts and v-necks, tops and capris, everything felt ok.

Everything felt as though it fit. The pieces matched, the colors fit, the binary shell I wore was gone. For those moments I could be me. And I can spare no thanks, no circular language for these individuals. And so it is with the ending of an ineloquent rant about the ineloquent past of genderblind genderqueer being shown true colors, I thank the ones that I have led me here. I thank Zach, though we speak little now, and though our encounter was rough around the edges, it pushed me to think, despite everything around us saying no. I thank all of those that have helped and supported me throughout my development, as you’re all too numerous to name, but to close to forget. I thank you Colleen for giving a stranger such kindness to feel alright with myself, and be able to see the color behind the binary the world has assigned me, it was one of the biggest steps in accepting myself. And finally I thank Sam, the wonderful colorbringer that has melded so well with me, and given me the most vibrant of colors in the purest of love, where I would not be today without, though we may be far away, our colors are never separate, and nothing can pull them away as we journey together to keep our colors, and show the world that gender is not a make it or break it condition, but love and only love. Because why the world may not believe it, and while it may be hard, it’s really really true.

Non-binary. Female. I'm happy with being a female. I just don't consider it a deciding factor for the way any other aspect of my life is. I dress the way I want. I dress in clothes that fit and look good on my body. I have a fairly androgynous style, though sometimes I will dress more feminine or masculine depending on my mood.

I'm going through pictures of myself on Facebook from this past weekend and I think, ""In all the pictures of me where I'm wearing women's clothing, I look absolutely ridiculous."" Maybe this is not so much a case of dysphoria as it is body-image issues. 

I look fat. Plain and simple. Women's clothing is typically designed to show off our curves. Some clothing is designed to flatter them. 

I am pretty fit (not to be confused with skinny), so I dress in a way that I think shows off my body without being too feminine. I usually wear skinny jeans and a tank or a t-shirt, and a plaid button down shirt. I guess I forget how wide my hips are or something, because when I look in the mirror, I like my body. I'm not too curvy (or so I think), so I imagine I can get away with looking androgynous while wearing skinny jeans. I guess not. Pictures tell a different story than the mirror. I have big hips. And I'm fat. And when I wear women's clothing, I look ridiculous because I don't have a particularly feminine body, even though I'm a healthy, fit female.

I got these black skinny jeans that fit me like a glove. I thought they showed off my super muscular thighs. I thought no other pants fit me as well as these. No. They just just accentuate my fat thighs and big hips. 

Today I put on boy's jeans and a wife-beater (is there another word for those tank tops? what a terrible word..). I felt good about the way I look today.

I'm thinking of writing up a Genderqueer 101 about the various flavors and nuances of gender. I often wind up explaining that gender is more of a cloud than it is a binary or a spectrum, and that it's important for each person to find their own way and discover themselves. I've been writing each of these posts wholesale for over a year now... I'm starting to catch myself repeating the same phrases and anecdotes. It's *almost* becoming formulaic: lead with data and information, follow up with encouragement to figure out what fits best for *the reader*. End with a reminder that people are always welcome to PM me with any questions they might have, and that there are resources available here, here, here, and over here too.

While this is important, and necessary, I worry that over time I'm becoming stale. Maybe I'm not providing all of the information I think I should be providing. So I think I'm going to write a bigger version with better links, better documentation, and more positive encouragement.

I'm a 23-year-old male-bodied person. I've always identified as a man even while being aware of the Transgender and Genderqueer communities, the difference between gender and sex, and the difference between gender identity and gender expression. I've always been most comfortable with a slightly feminine appearance until I've discovered Androgyny which I've found to be my ideal form of expression but neither changed my gender identity. 

I've grown my hair long my whole life, more than halfway down my back, and have a sense of body dysphoria relating to my facial hair that has lead me to pursue laser hair removal, otherwise I don't have any strong feelings about my body hair or other feelings of body or gender dysphoria. I sometimes shave my legs and always shave under my arms, but I don't feel strongly about having them shaved or not. In fact I don't feel really strongly in any way about appearing fairly masculine or appearing feminine. I'm pretty comfortable with either form of dress and don't really think of it as being super comfortable or uncomfortable. I feel fully at home if I'm presenting androgynously and it makes me extra comfortable to do so. I used to marker my nails black for a while in grade school until I felt uncomfortable about people mentioning it and only started painting them regularly (still only black) a year ago. Occasionally I'll wear eye-liner and I would do so more if I was better at applying it. I also wear concealer, mostly to try to cover up my 5 o'clock shadow. I have never considered myself to be crossdressing regardless of which sex my clothing was designed for. 

The most time I've ever spent questioning my gender identity was when I was dating a wonderful Trans woman that wasn't entirely sure whether I was Cis based on some of the things I expressed. The questioning went kind of like this: ""Hmm.. how do I feel about my body? This is a pretty okay shape. Penis? That's cool. How would I feel about breasts? Eh, not really into having breasts. I don't want to change my body. I'm not Trans."" I pretty much left it there and I've tried to avoid identifying my expression under the Trans* umbrella because I didn't match up to that idea.

I was writing a blog post tonight about being a ""Political Man"" in that I do all of these things but still feel that I should strongly assert my manhood because I think that being a man should include the possibility of skirts and makeup and it's better for society to do away with a lot of masculine tropes. I was also talking about the fact that I don't really have a problem with being misgendered because I have Cis privilege, all of this stuff.. blah blah.. the gist of it being that whatever I do while identifying as a man should be valid for men. Which kind of made me think about why I identify that way when I don't express that way, and whether I had any reasons OTHER than to make a political statement. I realized that I'm not sure if anything draws me to that identity other than wanting to do activism that targets assumptions about men. 

Now I'm feeling really lost. I don't feel like I fit anything I've heard about genderqueer people. I've always been comfortable in my binary, but I'm not entirely sure if that's because I'm just a man and that's that, or if I've shaped my conception of ""man"" to fit my identity for other reasons. I'm really confused and trying not to cry, and I'm not even sure why I feel like crying.

These last three weeks have been awful. I am fighting depression, having trouble getting dressed, leaving the house, interacting with family. My best friend, who knows about my gender problems, told me last night that it seems like I haven't been comfortable in my own skin. 

I'm not sure what else I can do. I am wearing almost entirely men's clothing. I bind, and my breasts are really small, so my chest almost passes. My haircut maybe needs tweaking. I think it reads more ""lesbian"" than ""male"". I'm not even sure I want to read as male all the time, but it would be really nice to get misgendered and not have people falling all over themselves to correct it. I got sir'd the other day and the guy apologized like twelve times and I said ""it's okay, you're mostly right"" and he said ""Why, that's an awful thing to say!"" :/

My body just feels wrong. My hips are too wide. My shoulders are too narrow. I have a classic hourglass figure. I can kinda hide it, but not entirely. My voice doesn't sound like mine. My name doesn't sound like mine. Hearing someone say my name makes me wonder who they're talking to.

I have been thinking a lot about where this all comes from, what's causing it. I'm not happy with some other things in my life too, this isn't all of it. I am making progress towards changing those things, but I just wonder if this is something to focus on since I'm largely unhappy anyhow. I wonder if I feel like I need to make changes because I am angry about what social things being a woman means. How much of this is social, and how much of it is who I really am? For some reason it seems okay to me if it's organic, but not if it's social. I don't know why.

I was thinking a lot about my childhood yesterday, trying to piece some things together. I was permitted to dress largely as I wanted until I was about 8. I found my kindergarten pictures, and I really do look like a little boy. My mom decided at some point that she'd had enough of having a tomboy and that I was going to be a girl whether I liked it or not. Around 8 years old, I started having panic attacks. There were a lot of other things going on - my mother was very controlling about other things too, but it hadn't occurred to me that the anxiety I had all through childhood might have been related to my gender. 

I'm wondering if it's time to start considering some more biological changes, such as hormones. I need to get in touch with my therapist again, probably. I'm fascinated by the idea of having a deeper voice and being able to grow facial hair. I'm drawn to that. But I'm also terrified. Those things aren't really things I can hide. I don't think I really want to go all the way male either.

I don't mean to offend anyone with this post, and I'm sorry if I use incorrect language to ask these questions.

Background on the lawsuit: There was a 6 year old girl who wanted to use the women's restroom at school. However, the school district wouldn't let her, because she had been born a male. The school district did offer to let her use the unisex bathroom or the nurse's bathroom, instead of the men's, but they wouldn't let her use the women's.

Questions:
1) What exactly is someone who is gender queer? I'm guessing that it goes beyond being ""tomboy"" or ""girly"". However, I don't understand the mentality.

2) Is gender queer coupled with homosexuality? For example, if you have someone who identifies male, does that mean that they will like females? What's the correct way to reference this attraction (homosexual versus heterosexual).

3) Is it possible for someone so young to be gender queer? I've heard (and this may be completely wrong) that homosexuality tends to come to light, once a person gets to be of an age where they acknowledge attraction. I know I thought about boys when I was in 1st grade, so is this just a problem of an adult (me) saying that the girl is too young to process her gender?

4) From the school district's side, what do you think would be a good course of action? At this age, did they offer the best solution that they could?

But I'm not sure how to come out more generally over for example FB. I've seen some FB coming out posts for people who are simply 'the wrong sex'.

But I have no idea how to say that I don't have a fixed gender in a way that wouldn't sound odd to someone who hasn't been in the LGBTQ community - The idea of the binary is reinforced a huge amount in our society - the concept of not always being one gender will be entirely alien to most people. 

The other issue I have at the moment is that I'm unarguably male in how I present at the moment. I have a beard, I have fat in all the wrong places. I'm not even slightly andro, let alone feminine - although I hope to be in time (If I can shift this goddamn weight without gaining muscle). So I'm worried that people will not take me seriously, or worse, will outright dismiss it as a phase. If I could present feminine I would, but as I've mentioned there are weight and family issues around that (It's hard enough hiding my shoes from my family, I couldn't imagine trying to wash any clothes as well).

I started reading Whipping Girl in bed last night, and then I couldn't sleep for hours because I was all of a sudden hating how masculine my body is (mainly my shoulders and facial hair growth). I don't think it was dysphoria, but it was a pretty unpleasant feeling.

I've spent today thinking and avoiding mirrors. I'm certain I'm not transsexual, since I don't want a female body and it's not my Y chromosome or genitals that are bothering me. I just want a more androgynous body than I have.

On an incredibly simplified scale of gender identity, Male|------|Female, I'd place myself barely left of centre. 0% female, and maybe 5% male. I'm fine with my name and masculine pronouns.

So what are your thoughts? I'm a very neurotic person, and it's entirely possible that this is just a temporary fixation. But I'd like to know if this is something I should contact a gender therapist about or if I should just continue exploring my feminine side.

Edit: thanks for the replies. Upvotes for all! I've come to think that I'm definitely not cis seeing as for the past week I've been having panic attacks that are only helped by applying eyeliner or shaving body hair.

    I am the faceless warrior, prefer do I this mask.  
    No needs for names or gender, things metal will outlast.  
    And if armor’s overused, even moreso as a symbol,  
    At least inspect the contours, a work of hands that tremble.  

    The body and the bulk, perhaps dismissed in jest,  
    Proudly serve my purpose; no more pieces to divest!  
    Ornate lines and flourish, engravings deep and bold,  
    These frame true my dignity, my burden still untold.  

    Mark me son or daughter (or cast me in between).  
    Distinction dulls in time, blade edgeless without sheen.  
    So few will pierce this suit, perhaps not more than one,  
    Lodged into its plating, a sword to twist and plunge.  

    But should the wielder loose their grip and strain to hear a sound,  
    A rhythmic clang of metal through its hollows may rebound.  
    For long has armor clung to flesh (or something out of reach);  
    And long has face been hidden, both their warmth and power leached.  

    Again I light the fire, crouching close and without fear.  
    Enveloped now in waves, soothing hope I must endear.  
    And for a time this metal glistens, reflecting all but shame,  
    Absorbing what it can, bending softly to the flame.  

    Is all such passion so produced, borne from one hot fire,  
    No other thoughts, no other dreams, no myriad desires?  
    Will the burning blaze return or settle down to rubble?  
    Will I kindle what remains or seize from endless struggle?  

    For if the blade embedded once could carry me thus far,  
    What might its master and I wield to further such a scar?  
    Could we crack this armored shell and rupture all the seals;  
    Expose the underneath but leave intact its metal peel?  

    Then might we try to reach beyond a site so neatly laid,  
    To find our warmth from other means not readily displayed,  
    To move beneath an empty sky, points of reference gone,  
    Journey through an undone land, protectors all withdrawn.  

    And pass would we the bends that wind to places barred from view,  
    Trudging forward, each solid step might seem like life renewed.  
    But we’d walk in solitude, past roads all marked with care,  
    Not to green and blossomed fields, to snow swept planes we’d dare.  ",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,,True,t3_sz2x9,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/sz2x9/a_somber_song_that_is_about_as_genderqueer_as_i/,

My basic question is that once you started questioning your gender, how did you stop yourself from just going ""oh I am trans obviously, if I don't fit into the binary I am in right now"".  And do you wish you were fully trans or completely comfortable with your assigned gender, rather than somewhere in between?

I [M20] started questioning my gender recently.  I cross-dressed and put some make up recently for the first time and loved it.  I incorporated it into my sex life and it improved it a lot, I found it easier to fantasize in a feminine role sexually when I had the trappings.  I felt very pretty in general and loved my feminine look.

I tend to think very black and white when dealing with personal identity, which I realize is kind of the antithesis of self-discovery and ""take things as they are"".  When I started to think about gender and why I liked reading about trans/gender non-binary stuff so much, I jumped immediately to thinking I'm trans, which logically I know is a little niave.

I don't really feel dysphoric, I am just not attached to my maleness much anymore at this point in my life, except that I know that it comes off well to others and allows me to be successful in my goals without any extra work or dealing with intolerance.

So, I guess, would it be weird of me to be disappointed that I am not trans and maybe just somewhere in the middle?  It would be more comfortable for me to know that I am ""this"" or ""that"" rather than this undefined thing in the middle that could be anything and is very hard for people to relate to.

And also, how do I know this all isn't just a phase because I am bored with life (seems a shallow way to live life)?

X-posting because this sub seems a bit more active and I'd really like to hear all I can about this

So basically, I've been thinking about where I fit on the gender spectrum and I realized I don't really know. I am AFAAB but from as far as I can remember, I've played mens roles when playing with my sister or other girls and wanted to be a woman when playing with boys.

I can never really decide what clothes I feel comfortable in as I seem awkward in both men's and women's styles and have always leaned towards neutral hoodie/jeans combos because of this. Occasionally, I'll wear dresses and feel so pretty and want makeup and long hair but then I'll want to chop all my hair off and dress more masculine. I get kind of upset when people call me ""girly"" or ""like a dude"". I usually feel the need to prove the opposite but get confused myself.

I don't mind being referred to as female pronouns, though it does sometimes surprise me (in neither a good or bad way) that people refer to me as ""she"" to other people as if it's the first time I've been referred to by it before. I apologize if this is rambly. I'm a bit scrambled right now.

I am comfortable with my body. I love having breasts and have gotten over the shame of my vulva/vagina that I'm sure most women go through, but I look at a lot of strap-on porn and I want one of my own just to wear sometimes. Though I'm with a cis-gendered man, I find myself sexually attracted to a lot of different people

I think I might be genderqueer because I don't think I want to present fully as either genders. I just kind of want to float but I'm afraid of committing to this in case this is something that people just do? I'm in my early 20's so I've had a little bit of time to figure myself out, but I feel like I'm a long way from it.

Last semester I dressed out in the girls locker room, mainly because I had feminine short hair and was wearing adrogynish clothing, and I didn't know there were any other options really. But over time I chopped off my hair, getting a fauxhawk, started dressing in slightly effeminate male clothes, and pretty much presenting as myself. The thing is I don't feel comfortable changing in the girls locker room at all at this point (used to be ok with it, but as I became more comfortable with myself the worse it got). I also feel like the girls feel uncomfortable as well. The main thing is I feel like I'm sort of tricking them when I change in there, and i feel fake and my dysphoria gets unbearable. I wouldn't be allowed to change in the guys one because I'm not physically a male, or a trangendered man. So that's out of the question. And I can't change in the gym teachers office because you have to go through the locker rooms to get in them. I just feel stuck... Any other ideas of where I could go?

I think going by ""she"" keeps me more closeted and makes it more likely for my friends to reference me being a girl. And, it's sort of weird that my friends who I am out to will still use ""she"" based just on my sex. I don't see a she when I look in the mirror, why should I give my friends more of a reason to?

My name is Sam. Short for Samantha. I have a weird history with my name. For a while in high school and early college I wanted to go by Samantha because to me it flowed better and went better with my last name. But before realizing I'm genderqueer I already was going by Sam (my work name tag even says Sam instead of Samantha, thankfully). Now that I realize this, and I'm slowly coming out to my friends, I've been thinking about the possibility of going by a different one. For one thing, when I go by Sam, people still assume the right to call me Samantha. Also, most Sams I know are girls so it's more often associated with Samantha anyways. 

A reason this jumped in my head lately is because the name ""Caleb"" appeared. I hadn't even really been thinking about changing my name, just pronouns at that point. Right away I thought about me going by it and it felt amazing for some reason. Now, this isn't a unisex name, it's considered a male name. I'm not the least bit binary identified, I don't even consider myself trans-masculine or in-between male and female. I'm just not a woman. My gender has no relation or connection to binary genders at all. So, that's in a way a drawback. But it also sort of fits because it challenges gendered names and also separates me more from being a woman than I otherwise would be. But it doesn't sound really masculine either, so it's nice. And I really like it. Another drawback is that I don't know how it sounds with my last name (alliteration, lol). But on the other hand it'll be a few years before I use it more officially because I'm not ready to be completely out. Another name I thought of was Morgan, because I always really liked the name, especially for guys. Most people I've talked to though, think it's more a girl's name. Which isn't a great fix for people thinking my name is feminine, but it also is a bit better because it would be safer for me to use as it's unisex. Another unisex name I like is Skylar, and it at least starts with my first initial. 

What do you guys think? 

*edit*: I feel like at this point the only thing keeping me from going with Caleb is how it fits with my last name. I mentioned these names to a friend and we both voted off Morgan. I miight still consider Skylar but I don't feel an attachment to it like I do with Caleb..",,False,,t5_2r1c3,1354593651.0,,genderqueer,True,t3_146qxl,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/146qxl/taking_more_steps_to_socially_transition/,

Even if no one reads it, it's important to me to get off my chest.

Anyways, for the past four or five years I've identified myself as bisexual, poly, kinky and a switch. Been fairly open about most of these and I'm surrounded by open and accepting friends at college right now which is great. So why not add another label to confuse people with right? 

For years my sister and closest friend have bugged me to dress up in drag for Halloween and for some reason this idea always made me really really embarrassed. I couldn't tell it then, but it was because the idea was rather appealing and I just didn't want to deal with it apparently. This year was the first year I decided to actually go along with the idea since my friend was going as a male for Halloween, we would have matching costumes. Sadly, the whole drag idea fell through when I didn't have enough time to get an outfit together, s.o instead I went as a lumberjack from Monty Python, complete with padded bra. 

The party was fun, but that wasn't what made me realize my genderqueerness. (If that is the right word.) While I was still in the planning phase of the costume, three customers at the store where I work mistook me for a woman (How that happened I have no idea, I'm a behemoth of a man with hair that is just starting to grow out.) Instead of making me feel embarrassed or peeved, I felt pleased. I distinctly remember thinking, ""Yes! It's working!"" and for the rest of my shift it was if I was walking on sunshine. That night, in an effort to be a bit more feminine I decided to shave a bunch of my body hair in the shower, something I've kept up to this day I enjoy the feeling so much. 

So I'm either genderqueer, fluid, bigender, or just have a giant fetish for crossdressing. One of those, not sure which yet. Still need to explore a bit, which brings me to my second and not as happy point.

I'm not in a good place to explore this at all currently. It's not my financial situation, my friends and family potentially rejecting me or anything like that, it's so ""First World Problems""-esque that I'm embarrassed to bring it up. I'm currently losing weight so quickly that it just doesn't make sense to buy any feminine clothing at all. Yup, ain't that a shame? 

It still leaves me with my hair, shoes and possibly makeup to play around with though. Not sure if I even want to play around with it until I'm smaller anyways. Must be impossibly hard for someone with a size 50 waist to experiment with clothing. I just worry though that if I don't start soon I'll miss out on my time to easily pass, or end up passing the time when HRT is feasible if I end up being trans. Not sure where I'm ending up with this so I want to keep it all open.

Thanks for listening to my ramblings. Or reading them. Or skimming them. Any of those.

For the last few days, I've been feeling very emotional and vulnerable, and I've been thinking a lot about my identity, my life, and where I'm going, and specifically I've been trying to think about gender identity and expression, and I just wrote this journal entry and wanted to share it.


**Monday, 8 October 2012, part 1**

Last night I couldn't help but think about gender, and in trying to understand my own gender identity.  I think I identify as genderqueer or dualgendered, two-spirited or fluid, or whatever way to describe that I don't feel strictly one way or another.  I have many times in the past found myself wishing I was female, more androgynous, that I was a lesbian trapped in a male body.  Sometimes I really wish I could change my sex at the push of a button.  I texted &lt;my friend&gt; to get her input.  Sometimes I feel like I'd like to see what hormone replacement was like, so I could understand how it affects my personality or if it would make me feel better or worse.  I've been thinking for some time now of some way I can express my femme, like painting my nails or shaving my legs or wearing a skirt.

**Monday, 8 October 2012, part 2**

I'm so gripped right now with trying to understand my own identity, and my gender identity in particular.  I've always fantasized about being the princess, the girl next door, I want to be the punk butch, the strong alpha female, the innocent naive girl, I want my image to reflect the way I want to express myself that day.  I've never defined myself as a male.  I think the world imprinted on me an image of what I should be, and I strove to become that image, but I've never felt that feeling come from somewhere inside me.  Of course I want things that might be considered masculine, I consider them human.  I want to protect my partner.  I want to provide for them and care for them, I want to be a good parent to my children.  Sometimes I do appreciate my male form, and I can put myself into that mindset, but it takes effort.  My natural state is somewhat in between.  I want to be held, I want to be nurtured, I want to be small, submissive, my male fantasies are all about being submissive, I imagine myself as female with a male.  I want to be able to feel deep emotional connection - I feel like I wish I looked more androgynous.  I wish I could change my physical form at will to reflect the way I felt inside and the way that it changes.  Someone I was chatting with online referred to me as a 'she', and I felt a little surge of excitement - my personality can be perceived as female.  I just wish my body could.  Past couple days have been very emotional for me.  I cried the other day just to do it.  I was watching something or listening to some music, and something made me sad and I just went with it.  I just wanted to feel my emotional self again.  I believe my life and upbringing, my attempt to fit that hypermasculine mold has crippled a part of me that I want back! I feel emotionally stunted, and I try and try and it's so difficult sometimes to connect to my own emotions and really understand them, and to communicate that to people and not bottle things up.

How do people deal with dysphoria? I've recently come to identify not as male (not entirely sure what yet; either genderqueer/fluid or agender), and dysphoria has really been troubling me. I've been noticing more and more the little things in which I *have* to choose between male or female (like today, applying for university) and the general public's (perhaps forgiveable) cluelessness to anything beyond the binary (recent examples include gender-specific poses in school photos), and it's really wearing me down, to the point where on particularly bad days I'm unable to bring myself to get out of bed.

And as such, it's hard to even consider asking people to use neutral pronouns, because I know it'd lead to explanations and prejudice and the like on a near-daily basis, and I don't know if I could handle that at all.

I've changed my name once before, to be rid of my middle name (for my grandmother who being compared to became a family slur for bitchy-ness) as well as my family name (it held the weight of a combination of various negative life/family experiences).

I've been identifying as gender-queer for a while now, at least in private with my SO and therapist, along the bigender spectrum. I usually use my given first and new middle names for the femme side, and two masculine names for the first and middle names on the homme side. I've gotten very comfortable with the contraction of the first-homme name, and have been contemplating incorporating it and/or both homme names into my legal name.

The only issue, I feel, is that it would feel and/or look too long (they actually sound really good together in a particular order). If I were to do that, it would look something like this:

*femme1 femme2 homme2 homme1 surname*

Complicating matters is that my SO and I would like to hyphenate our names eventually, in the event of marriage, which would make it even longer:

*femme1 femme2 homme2 homme1 surname-surname*

I feel that last one is getting into the realm of ridiculousness, but I really want to keep a balance of femme-to-homme names, and can't stand the idea of parting with my middle femme name (although if I have to I will). Does anyone have a suggestion or thoughts on this?

I plan to only use one first name with my surname in day to day life (switching between the two), and picking the femme or homme middle names if I'm particularly one gender or the other that day. I mostly just want to know if anyone thinks this is too pretentious or dumb looking to be buried in legalese somewhere, or if anyone has a suggestion for picking/making something simpler. Perhaps the two first names with a suitably epic ""middle"" name I could use with them both? If that's the case how do I pick something epic enough and not come off as a pretentious douche with a short name versus a pretentious douche with a long name?

For reference, if it helps, the syllables are as follows:

* femme1: 2
* femme2: 2
* homme2: 2
* homme1: 4
* my surname: 1

As the title suggests, I'm a bit uncertain about what gender queer really means and because of that I'm not certain if I identify with it. Sorry if my post becomes a bit long winded, I want to make sure I can give everyone an accurate vision of my current level of understanding.

I first came across the term gender queer when a friend (who I have since lost contact with) described herself as such. I tried to get a better understanding of what she meant, since I felt what she described could easily be applied to myself and didn't seem like anything really different. I was never able to fully comprehend the term, and the best description that came up was ""sometimes I feel masculine, sometimes I feel feminine"" with her continuing on saying sometimes she likes wearing dresses, and sometimes she likes wearing pants. 

I am still very much confused as to what exactly being gender queer is like. If I describe myself in terms of 'typically' masculine and feminine things, I fall somewhere in the middle. In terms of dress, it changes daily depending on whether I, myself, feel 'male' or 'female' that day, and I even feel that sometimes my personality changes slightly to exhibit features of the gender I am that day (it's not intentional, however, it feels like a natural change when I'm being myself). Growing up, I was often considered a tomboy. I wore male clothing most of the time, and was often mistaken for being a boy (especially since at the time I had a smaller chest). I'm never mistaken for a guy anymore, but I honestly don't think that I would mind. Even when presenting as female I sometimes wish people wouldn't think of me in terms of gender, but just another person. Perhaps that is a different discussion altogether. 

My boyfriend knows all about me and how I feel, and he was one of the first people I discussed gender queerness with. He also heard my friend's description and says that, from what he can tell, it applies to me. 

During masturbation I sometimes think about having my own penis, and it's a bit difficult trying to describe my feelings around this. I never really considered this as something abnormal (whether it is or not, I don't know). It just feels like sometimes a penis would be good. I don't really have a desire to have one for real, as in trying to get surgery, but I really don't care about having a vagina either. If I woke up male tomorrow, I wouldn't really be phased, and I don't really care either way.

I feel like I fit the description of gender queer (if I'm wrong feel free to correct me). At the same time I don't see the point of it. I'm female, and have no desire to get surgery to become otherwise. Even when I'm wanting to be seen as a guy I feel like it doesn't really matter, because I AM female. I think that a lot of my confusion has to do with the fact that (even when feeling like a different gender) I'm apathetic. I don't care if I'm male, and I don't care if I'm female... and because of that why WOULDN'T I just call myself female, since that at least applies to something physical. I feel like the idea that I may be gender queer irrelevant.

I hope you can understand what I meant in a lot of this post, it's the first time I've ever really tried to express my entire feelings on the subject.

from r/transgender)",spursdude92,11,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/r85i2/a_little_help_or_something_unsure_here_xpost_from/,"**I posted this is the wrong place yesterday, and so I've posted it here instead**

Hi there, the title is likely confusing and unclear. If that's the case, then it somewhat eludes to how I feel. For years I have felt this constant to-and-fro feeling towards being trans/not trans. And I've just been needing a little place where I can talk about how I feel without being judged. If you don't care for that then feel free to stop reading.

It all started when I was about 12 (now 19) when I started to get envious of girls over, well most things. From the fact that they got to dress a certain way, to the fact that their bodies looked a certain way compared to the way mine was starting to become etc (puberty's a bitch) but after about a year (at an all boy school) I kind of got comfortable with being a guy and was happy, playing in the football (soccer) team, Rugby team and water polo team as well as doing a little fencing at the school. I was ok with being a guy, but every so often would wonder what if I were a girl.

At 15 I started hanging around some girls from an all girl school close by and it started making me feel dysphoric again. I questioned a lot about myself, but obviously kept it all inside and internalised my jealousy and became self-hating.

It was at this time that I started truly writing music that I felt had any meaning and substance to it. I started to feel as though the fluidity and interplay of counter melodies I created symbolised how I felt about my gender, whilst the harsh, aggressive chugging riffs embodied my anger, which at first I was aimed at myself, but later became aimed at the world for making me think I couldn't express myself.

Fast forward to now and I suddenly go on reddit, I find people who talk about ""genderfluidity"" and the like, and get intrigued. I keep reading and I feel as though I identify with this idea of being somewhere inbetween Male and Female, being both and niether at the same time. I love being a guy at times, but at others I hate it... It's hard to verbalise how I actually feel, like there aren't the words in the English language to describe it (or that I just lack the eloquence to find the correct words). So I'm going to use a word coined by my younger brother - Omniflage, to mean when that all encompassing feeling when you feel odd or weird, like something is wrong but don't know why or when something isn't wrong.

The main issue I have is, how do I tell people, or express myself if I'm not even sure how I feel? Now for some the answer may be a simple ""just do what feels right"" but for me, with religious Jewish family (not my immediate family, but grandparents, uncles and aunts etc. who I see regularly) as well as my friends being wholly ignorant when it comes to this kind of thing, it's hard to do something without being scared or freaked out that something bad will happen.

I guess I don't really know why I wrote this, but I just needed somewhere where I could finally say exactly how I've been thinking and get my thoughts out there, so that I don't unnecessarily put a label on myself for someone else to understand my thoughts or so I don't try to fit myself into something I'm not. I'm still unsure as to who I am or how I feel myself, which may contribute to why I have yet to express this externally. I'm aware this is entirely incoherent and probably not worth any kind of read, but for me this has already helped in terms of being highly therapeutic.

I normally hate shopping. I don't really wear a lot of women's clothing, and presenting as female, and shopping for men's clothes can be irritating sometimes. This means I put it off as long as I can. It is also complicated by the fact that I want my husband to come with me because he is cool about my gender issues, and helps me feel less wretched about the whole affair. 

So here I was going into it kind of freaked out, and it turned out fine. We went to the mall, and after a couple of fruitless serches we landed in American Apparel. Not a normal shop for me, but the clerk was really cool. I tried on my stuff, and then when my husband put pink fingernil polish on the counter, the clerk didn't even blink when I said it was for the hubbies toes, not me. 

The second good experience was at Buckle? I had never heard of this store before, but one of the young male clerks cottoned on to things quick. He brought me cool clothes, gave me masculine jean suggestions to downplay my hips, and everything. 

I can honestly say it was two of the best shopping experiences I've had since I stopped wearing women's clothing. I mean, it's all good if I can just buy something and leave, but I do like to try things on for fit. 

I guess I was just really surprised I could go to the mall shops and get advice from a generic clerk on how to minimize my feminine attributes. It was really an unexpectedly nice experience.

I'm biologically female, but I'm working on transitioning to be more androgynous. I am ""absolutely fucking adorable"" apparently, or the way most people say it ""cute"". I don't mind being told that I'm cute or having my cuteness talked about, as long as it's just a short mention and then on to another topic. It also doesn't bother me as much when I'm called cute without being compared to any archetype of cute, where the subtext is left up to interpretation. That way, I can at least pretend it's a more gender-neutral or even masculine form of cute.

The thing that really gets to me is when conversation focuses on my cuteness for too long, or when I'm compared to particularly girly archetypes for cute (like shirly temple), or when it has do do with how cute I was with longer hair, etc. etc. Anyway, after a point it starts sounding less like compliments and more like mean-spirited teasing. Worse yet, these comparisons remind me of all of the things I like least about my body, all of the things I desperately wish I could change.

Last night I actually ended up leaving a gathering of friend--all but in a huff--because I felt so insulted and humiliated. At the time, however, my friends thought that they were complimenting me, or, at worst, participating in some light-hearted teasing.

I don't know if I identify at all. It kinda feels antithetical to why I'm doing this in the first place.

Which brings me to this-

I may have accidentally decentralised my identity. I have no preferred pronouns. I haven't changed my name, or id documents. I don't feel it's within my right to do so. Or more to the point, I don't feel it's -productive- for me to do so, as if my end goal is letting go of gender as an identifier altogether, and having others negotiate it in my place. I'm known very differently to separate people, even within the same circles. It feels like a very real reflection of the way gender is understood and utilised so it seems to me the most authentic experience to work with. Maybe that's what I'm seeking in all this; what gender can achieve, and how.

I was just sent a rather interesting question, and I thought you might be interested in the response I wrote. Here is the exchange in it's entirety. I didn't really get the chance to go into the kind of depth I would have preferred, but I think I answered the user's question. First, the question, quoting a comment which I'm pretty sure I'd left on /r/AskHistorians:

&gt; ""This is kind of funny because in ancient cultures, genderqueer people were valued precisely because they could bridge the gap between male and female and act as mediators between both groups.""
Seriously? That's kickass! Where could I read more about that?

Since your question involved genderqueer spiritual and shamanic practices, and there is a *lot* of ground to cover, I'll focus on just a few examples from each continent.

Start by looking up ""[two spirits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit)""... people who were formerly known as *berdaches*, but that term has since fallen out of favor because it's kind of offensive, like calling someone a prostitute. One of my favorite two spirit stories features an invading Sioux raiding party that was stopped in it's tracks by the mere presence of a single two spirit among the people they were raiding. Two spirits are considered to have a special connection with the spiritual world, allowing them to walk in many different social roles with ease, which in turn makes them very powerful shamans. 

There are several different varieties of two spirit traditions, different tribes had their own variations. The Mohave, for example, have a creation myth that features four genders: male, female, *alyha*, and *hwame*. The Lakota have the *winkte*, and the Navaho have the *nadleeh*. The Navaho actually recognize five genders, similar to the Bugis, below. (More on them in a moment!)

If you're interested in two spirits, I highly suggest these books: 

* [Two-Spirit People: Native American Gender Identity, Sexuality, and Spirituality](http://www.amazon.com/Two-Spirit-People-American-Sexuality-Spirituality/dp/0252066456/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)

* [Becoming Two-Spirit: Gay Identity and Social Acceptance in Indian Country](http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Two-Spirit-Identity-Acceptance-Country/dp/0803271263/ref=pd_sim_b_5)

* [Changing Ones: Third and Fourth Genders in Native North America](http://www.amazon.com/Changing-Ones-Fourth-Genders-America/dp/0312224796/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_y)

(I own the first two, I haven't finished the third.)

Even though ""Two Spirits"" are something of a Native American phenomenon, you'll find people in these social roles all around the world. Many of these traditions persist today. In Myanmar, the *acault* serve as spirit mediums. In Madagascar, the *sekrata* are considered to have significant spiritual protection. In Siberia, many Chuckchi shamans are what we would call genderqueer.

In southern Indonesia, the Bugis recognize five genders: male, female, *calabai*, *calalai*, and *bissu*. *Calabai* and *calalai* are what we would recognize as MTF or FTM transgender people, respectively. Meanwhile *bissu* exhibit all five genders as a single, harmonious unit, what we'd call genderqueer or bi gender. The advice of a *bissu* is usually sought when a Bugi has deep spiritual questions or is about to undertake a pilgrimage. 

In Bugi society, it's common practice and considered a blessing to have a *calabai* involved with the wedding preparations, and many wind up responsible for arranging the settings, the clothing, the makeup, the catering, preparing the venue, and running the reception.

[Here's the wiki article about Bugis and gender.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bissu#Bissu)

Similarly, in Kenya, the *mashoga* are biological men who assume female gender roles early in life and they are integral at wedding ceremonies. In modern times, the term *mashoga* has also become accepted as the Swahili word for ""gay.""

In the Dominican Republic, genetics has created a slew of intersex individuals, known as *[guevedoces](http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~issues/articles/13.1_Kelley_E_The_Guevedoces.html)*. Their society has changed to accommodate these people, coming to accept them as a third gender entirely. [Here's another link about guevedoces, though it's NSFW.](http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-guevedoces.html ""NSFW, link provided as an anthropological resource."")

A little further south, there are the *travestis* of Brazil and Argentina, and there are also the *quariwarmi* of the area we now call Peru. While *travestis* are modern, the *quariwarmi* were genderqueer shamans of the dual-gendered Incan deity, *chuqui chinchay*. 

Perhaps the most well-known modern group would likely be the [hijra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hijra_(South_Asia)) of India or the [kathoeys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathoey) of Thailand. To my knowledge, neither is a particularly shamanistic tradition, though there are festivals and celebrations which feature the *hijra* and the *kathoeys* very prominently.

Wearing it boosted my mood, my energy, made everything better...and not wearing it [made everything come crashing down hard.](http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/19s0km/gender_transgressions_pushing_back_hurts/)

My wife is trying to be understanding, but it isn't helping that I really don't understand what's going on either.  Her latest attempt to help consisted of her hearing me say ""I like the way this underwear makes me feel"" and understanding it as ""I like the way this underwear feels"".  She stopped by a store on her way home from work, and was smiling ear to ear as she handed me a pack of micro-fiber men's briefs.  She was sure she'd found the solution to all our problems, because this men's underwear, to her, felt and fitted the same as what I'd been wearing - I think she thought I could wear it and be happy, and all this would be over.

I thanked her and picked it up, and at her urging I tried it on.  She was so happy about it that it felt like the least I could do.  It was OK, I was allright - no emotional lift like *my* underwear, but no crushing feelings either.  We even made some jokes about her getting some just like it in her size if she thought it was so nice to wear.  Then she invited me to finish getting dressed and come downstairs to watch TV with the family.  She cheerily led the way, so pleased with herself for coming up with this clever fix for what was wrong.  I lagged behind, as the moment I thought of leaving the room wearing these I felt my legs go weak and I had to lean on the bed to keep from falling down.

I didn't collapse on the upstairs landing like the last time I tried to wear men's underwear, so that's progresss I suppose.  I did sit there downstairs for about fifteen minutes, responding like a robot to everything, even to something on the TV show where I was supposed to laugh, with a stomach twisting in knots and every muscle in my body so tight she could feel me shaking.

I excused myself, went upstairs to our bedroom and tore every stitch of clothing off like it was on fire.  I curled up under all the blankets in a corner of the bed, shaking like my body was coming apart, trying to make my breathing work properly again.

After a little while she came up and held me - worried about me, but I think a little angry that her gift hadn't fixed everything.  I told her I was embarrassed and ashamed at falling apart like that, but I didn't tell her I felt hurt because, at the moment, I felt like she would rather I was 'normal' than happy.  The feeling passed as she held me, and things felt much better that night.

That was two days ago.  Yesterday she was distant, diving into her artwork and being uncomfortable with hugs or kisses or anything when we passed close to each other.  This morning, before I got dressed, she was almost surly.  When I got her to talk, she said she didn't want to talk about this, she just wanted it to go away.  She told me about how when she was a little girl her mother got mad at her and ripped apart a pretty dress she just got that she really liked to wear, ripped it apart in front of her and splattered it with bacon grease - and how my wife wanted to do that to my new underwear, and hated feeling that way.

I passed her in the front room a few minutes later, on my way to work.  She looked me over, and in a voice made to tear me down said, ""You're wearing them, aren't you?""

I shouted at her ""NO I'M WEARING THE GODDAMN UNDERWEAR I'M SUPPOSED TO!!"" - pulled open my pants and showed her the white men's cotton briefs I'd worn all my life except for the past week and a half.  I was shaking so bad I could barely stand, even when I sat down my whole body felt like it was coming apart.

It felt like it was going to be a fight, it turned into a discussion.  She tells me it's OK, it's just underwear, I'm not doing anything wrong - she even tells me how much she loves the other changes I've been motivated to make, the way I care about my appearance at work, that I'm wearing my contacts so she can see my eyes, that I'm trying so much harder to connect with her.

She tells me she's not used to seeing me as a ""shriveled, shaking wreck"", and that everyone needs a ""crutch"" to feel good about themselves.  She tells me it's OK to wear these if I need it, since she won't have to see it...so it's OK as long as I hide it from her so she doesn't have to think about it.  She tells me that she thinks that part of what's hurting me is shame about what I'm doing, but I don't have to worry as she won't tell anyone.

I went upstairs to change, and she came up and saw me putting the finishing touches on my work outfit, and the way I was standing tall and smiling and happy even after all this...and she pushed past me with an exasperated ""Oh God"" as she went to throw some clothing on to take me up to work.

She was distant and short with me on the drive - it's only a minute or two, I usually walk but was running late today.  I'll see her at lunch and see how things are going, but it looks like things will be worse before they'll be better.  It's like she's mad that she can't make me happy herself, or mad that I can have something besides her make me happy - and frustrated that she hasn't made me happy in the first place.

I'm seeing my doctor to get counseling for me the day after tomorrow.  I'm going to keep encouraging her to get counseling for herself, and for us.

She is also reading it currently and so far finds it interesting.  I asked her if it covered any transgender issues relating to the Bible, and she mentioned something about how he used LGBT a lot in the book, but as we all know, LGBT does not always include the T.  I was wondering if anyone had read this book and could clue me in on if it did cover transgender issues, because if my mom could be swayed with a religious argument, it would make my life a hell of a lot easier coming out to her.  Although either way, this is very good news, because she currently doesn't believe that being gay is morally okay, and at least she is taking a second look for the better, and I am so excited I'm about to cry right now.  I'd go get the book now if I had the money, but unfortunately, I don't right now, so I was wondering if anyone knew anything.  Thanks so much.


EDIT/UPDATE:  So my mom went to the lecture and seems pretty swayed that being gay is okay, which will make my life a million times easier, and may make me come out to my parents sooner than I thought.  I found out she picked it up because there are people in her Sunday school class that believe all the world's problems are ""the fault of the homosexuals"" and she wanted to find a way to refute them, since my sister is out to my parents as bisexual and my mom was very offended by these people because of that.  My dad still thinks that being gay or trans is morally wrong, but my mom getting this book did open up an opportunity for a conversation with my dad, and he basically believes he should keep his opinions to himself and that his children will lead their lives differently than how he believes they should, and that it's our lives and our right to do so and he's okay with that.  I have convinced him to watch ""For the Bible Tells Me So"" at some point, since he's not really into reading and it covers the same subject matter.

[EDIT: Well, I somehow convinced myself to hit post on Facebook. I'll let you know how it goes]

---The post------

This is the hardest thing I've ever had to write, and if you're reading this I consider you a friend; so it's time to be honest with you. My only request is that you don't share this with my family. They don't know, and they'll need their own explanation in time, in person.

I've been running and hiding. For so long I've denied who I am, but I know that you stuck with me through my ups and downs. Some of you may have suspected part of this, for others it will be totally out of left field. Either way if you have any questions feel free to comment, or message me, or ask me in person.

The short version is that I'm gender-queer. This means that I don't happily fit in as either a male or female. I'm happy presenting as male most of the time, But sometimes I want to be more feminine. When I have to I can go for months at a time being male and relatively happy, but I feel much more comfortable when I don't confine myself to presenting as male. So sometimes I may wear something feminine. Currently it's most likely to be shoes, but in the future, it could be more comprehensive. I hope to one day be able to present as entirely female, or at least androgynous when I choose. In the mean time I will look like a guy wearing some female stuff. And I'm fine with that. It's how I am. and I hope you will be fine with that too.

I've known something wasn't right for a long time. Definitely since I was about 11 or 12, although possibly earlier. I had occasional forays into exploring my gender, but I only started actually questioning myself properly in my first year of university. And now after 3 years of questioning and learning, I've accepted who I am. I'm not always a male. I'm not always a female. I am who I am. I'm happy with the name &lt;BirthName&gt;. I'm happy with being biologically male. But I'm also happy with presenting as female, or androgynous. I'm happy with male, female and gender-neutral pronouns. I am happy with wearing whatever clothes I feel like. I am happy with me.

I've always been the type to wear T-shirts. I never really wear anything very masculine or feminine. But I guess I got sick of people perceiving me as a girl right away, because I'm agender. I just have a very feminine face or something?

But I've quickly discovered that I feel really.. awkward in men's clothing. Even when it really fits perfectly fine when I look at myself in the mirror. As soon as I leave the house I get uncomfortably aware of my ""feminine"" mannerisms. From the way I walk to the way I cross my legs when I sit or the way I slouch forward a bit in my seat. Has anyone else had this problem? I know gender identity is separate from expression, but what does it mean when I can't even dress in guy's clothes? Why do I feel so self conscious of my own feminine attributes? I don't get it. Another question I had is how long it took you to realize you're genderqueer. I'm going through this pretty late in life, and though a lot of things from my past make more sense now, it's strange to hear so many people say ""being called a girl/boy NEVER felt right to me"" or that they've always expressed themselves androgynously. I didn't really have that experience growing up, and I never really thought about my own gender identity in depth until recently.

I'm totally fine with the pronouns ""he"" or ""him."" However, I take issue with describing myself as a ""man,"" in the sense that I have no concrete definition of what a man is to begin with. Are there certain behaviors, qualities, and appearances necessarily bound to being a ""true"" man or woman? Can there be a such thing as an ideal man or woman who purely exemplifies these things?

For instance, I've never really been into sports. Or when my dad is mad at me, he says, ""now I'm going to talk to you like a man"" and starts yelling and swearing. Is being a man marked by aggression, strength, and emotional insensitivity? (I know that peoples' concepts of ""manliness"" can differ from this, but this shows that there is no absolute definition.) And if the ideas of a ""true"" man or woman don't actually exist, aren't we all genderqueer, in a sense?

Am I to be defined by a vague category that society assigns me? I'm also multi-racial, middle class, and left-handed. These things also play factors in who I am (more or less.) But I don't think any of these labels can accurately give someone an idea of *who I am.* To me, ""man"" or ""black"" are pretty empty ways of really describing an individual. Sure, there may be practicalities in identifying a person as such. ""Black"" can speak to the environment and past struggles a person has been in. But people can be pigeonholed with others who bear huge differences from them. To create this dichotomy of ""man"" and ""woman"" seems to ignore the vast diversity that can exist within each of these labels.

The only other person I've brought any of this up with at all is my half sister who I barely even know because she's lived in Washington my entire life, and a stranger I found from one of my friends on facebook who works for the Gender Identity center of facebook.

Basically I've been having tons and tons of mixed feelings about who I really am. When I was very young, like in second grade I've felt like I would be more me in a girl's body. I remember specifically praying to God one night as hard as I could, to put me in an alternate universe but as a girl even though my family weren't religiously involved in almost anyway. After that I started to second guess my self and tricked myself into thinking my life wasn't so bad as a male.

I've spent long long nights thinking about it specifically and now I just really don't know what I actually want. On one hand I find everything to do with being female interesting and feeling as if that's what I want, and I even just ask to go by my chosen female name and use a feminine voice when talking to other people online, though I have never shown them my face, and I make up a different past to explain my own side of things like some sort of compulsive liar, though I just really don't want to be a guy. I'm not trying to get ANYTHING from them besides them believing I am really a cisgendered woman.

And then on the other I hand I pulled myself out of depression from ""not being"" a female and was completely fine with being a male.

But I still can't help but thinking, like, I would be me if I wasn't ""QuestionablyGqThrow"".

It's all very confusing to me and I feel like there's two me's. One that's female and one that's male.

The only thing I am absolutely certain about my sexuality and gender identity though is that I'm pansexual

If anything I GUESS I would choose to identify as genderqueer or possibly bi-gender, but I still can't but help feeling I just want to be a woman in a woman's body.

I've been kicking around an idea for a clothing business. I, at 235 lbs and at 5'2"", have a hell of a time finding clothes that fit me. Once I find stuff in my waist size, I usually have a pair of pants that's got so much extra material at the legs, I could probably make myself a second pair. Finding shirts is also a hassle, especially nice ones. I have a thick neck and fairly broad shoulders, but...again, I'm very wee in the height area. 


I'm sure there's plenty of people around here who have problems finding clothes that fit them. I know my ex-girlfriend had troubles, being that she was close to 6'4"" and broad chested. And there's the other side, very slender and small gentleman. It's difficult to get out of the ""twelve year old"" looking phase when one's clothes all come from the little boy's section.


I also want to do something for the Genderqueer crowd, maybe find some way to make androgynous clothing. Any genderqueer people have suggestions as to what would make good clothing options? 


Basically, I just have this idea of being able to make a store for people who'se genetic makeup don't necessarily ""fit"" the usual store idea of what sizes should be for clothing. Primarily trans focused, of course, but honestly, I've known plenty of cis people who have had these same problems. I just don't have the technical knowledge to...well, really do any of this. I've been looking up how to open a small business, but that's definitely going to take a while to sift through.

1328633445.0,8,self.genderqueer,peu7m,"Hello, from a little bit weird guy.",wwwwolf,9,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/peu7m/hello_from_a_little_bit_weird_guy/,"It's funny how after hours of thinking I can't think of a better description than ""a little bit weird guy"".

It's probably easiest to just say the definite facts. I'm a bisexual male, notably leaning toward females. And I don't think I have any problems being a guy, physically speaking.

But mentally, well, that's a different question with completely odd answers.

I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that I *have* such thing as a personality.

I could say that it's starting to become clear to me that I have kind of a division between what I physically am, and what I am as a creative entity. My physical side is just what it is. My creative self is just... being creative, I guess.

People probably say that I'm roleplaying or something. I think that's incorrect.

I am a *narrator figure.*

The biggest revelations I've had lately have all had to do with the fact that I'm a writer, and how everything has something to do with the fact. Looking back, I can see that I'm one walking the path of words. My mission in this life is to tell stories. My mission in this life is to provoke thoughts through commentary.

And authors are supposed to distance themselves from the works. Good stories stand on their own. Solid facts stand on their own. But that is not how tales are told. People, surprisingly enough, care about who the author is, even when that's completely irrelevant as far as the story goes.

Which is why I become a narrator of some description.

This is so deeply ingrained in my personality that I can't shake it. I take the garbs of a narrator to make my way through a situation in life. I *become* the narrator. I find it easier to tell some kinds of tales by being a guy. I find it easier to tell some kinds of tales by being a gals. And people may have their expectations of some tales being told by men or women, but that's somewhat irrelevant; I just have to tell what I feel, and those feelings are somehow related to the narrator figures.

And mind you, it's still the *same output*. I don't mean that my writing would be purposefully adapted to use male or female writer clichés. It's just that I get my mind to the proper gear and manage to be somehow perceived as *something*.

And I feel comfort *being* these narrator figures. I feel comfort in building these storyteller agents. And yes, *now* we can get back to the roleplaying discussions: I enjoy character design in all forms. ...Maybe it's easier to understand this way: if I design a RPG character, I put my soul into that process, much the same way I put my soul in my characters and narrator figures. These fictional folks *are* me. They're my lenses for seeing the world in thousands of ways.

I now realise what exactly I meant when I realised, long ago, that most of my characters in my fiction have to have a *little* bit of my personality in them. Not total Mary Sues, but *something* little that may remind people who wrote this crud.

The key word here is ""comfort"", though. It's strange. I've posted on some other forums and listed my gender as female. That's how I identified my narrator figure as. That's what I *am*. And somehow I find comfort in that. Much like how I found comfort writing a tale in which a protagonist is female. And sometimes, I can feel comfort in being listed as male or exploring how a male character is feeling in a story.

This is all becoming clearer now. I was once thinking that it was just my online identity having a bit of gender confusion going on, but now I think it's just getting clearer that it's all coming back to what I really am: Yet another human being who is driven to inform and entertain, and who somehow has to pick a gender when telling tales.

I used to think it's completely irrelevant who I am, but I'm beginning to think that it may put my mind at ease if I just think of myself as having narrator personalities. A final curveball coming up: I just don't know what it says of me that my favourite ""narrator personality"" is just this tomboy living in my head. Maybe this is how oddness was destined to be.

Finally, here's [A random drawing I made earlier](http://fav.me/d4bayyd). Before all these strange revelations. =)

Not too long ago, I figured out that maybe (and by maybe I mean yeah totally entirely) guys weren’t my cup-o-tea. I was and am cool with that. So are the people I care about. Everyone has been supper supportive and it’s all been rainbows and butterflies…mostly rainbows though.

A little while after that, I started feeling weird about myself. That is the best was I can describe it. Just weird. An uncomfortable dust seemed to cling to my reflection whenever I looked in the mirror. 

I started to dress more masculine, cut off my hair, started wearing men’s clothes, so on and so forth. I felt better for a while, about a month? I never really thought it could be a gender thing. I just sort of took it as, “You’re just becoming your inner butch now that you’re allowed to be one.""

But(t) then dressing masculine wasn’t enough…I ditched the traditional bra for a sports. When I wore it, I looked almost entirely like a dude and loved it. I pitched my voice a little lower and started carrying myself like a man. It made me happy,

BUTT THEN I started feeling like shit about presenting masculine! I felt wrong still, so I went uber femme. I was happy again. I was a girl, absolutely sure of it… and a damn fierce femme girly girl at that.

Now…I don’t know…I get up, look in the mirror and my heart feels like it’s being smushed. I feel like a girl but also like a man. I get in the shower and want to die because I have lady bits and half of me is okay with that but the other half wants to chop them off and the third stronger part wants to be a worm so I don’t have to have any bits at all. 

I feel like a crazy person because I nearly cry trying to figure out what clothes to put on. A dress? No, that is wrong and make my chest feel all tight. A button up? nono get off me I want to crawl out of my skin. 

Hell, It isn’t even really the clothes that are bugging me. I’m okay flipping a giant middle finger to gender norms and dressing however the fuck I want. It isn’t about not liking dresses or men’s clothes. It’s so much deeper than that. I could easily identify as a chick and dress both femme and manish if that was it. 

Nothing feels right inside too. I feel like I’m caught between man and woman, even though I know there are so many more options than that. . I never thought gender could be such a huge deal. I use to just sort of shrug at the idea. Sure whatever, be what you want and lets move on.

Now, I don’t know what to do with myself…I feel ill in my body. I can’t be okay with who I am anymore. Just thinking about it makes me want to puke.

I don’t feel like a man. But I do. I don’t feel like a woman. But I do. I feel like both and neither. 

Is this gender queer? If so how the hell am I supposed to live like this??

I don’t know…I keep hoping one day I’ll wake up and know. I’ll be able to look at my crotch and say Yes or No. 

In short, screw diddly do gender, I want to be a slug. 

I've been lurking here for a while and decided I could try and ask for some advice or at least sympathy. Thanks for taking the time to read my post. You rock.

1369759370.0,9,self.genderqueer,1f7ha1,First post. Be gentle. I have no idea what I'm doing. Lots of questions and confusion. (long),nanuen,11,2,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1f7ha1/first_post_be_gentle_i_have_no_idea_what_im_doing/,"Hey peeps. As the title suggests this is my first post here.. I've just been reading and looking at the wonderful pictures you guys post (so much confidence!). 

Anyways.. until recently I never really questioned anything. But then the landslide started. I'm 28, and biologically female. And to put things into some context: I have a very free and accepting mother, but there was a lot of drama when she left my dad. My dad is a former jehovas witness and a grade A psychopath. And as expected, conventional gender roles and everything that comes with that were strictly enforced throughout my childhood.. and yet, ironically, I think he secretly wanted a son (but instead got two girls).. it was a very confusing upbringing, to say the least.

Anywhoo.. I continued to live in denial-land for the sake of my own sanity at the time. But I've always felt weird.. or, not normal. I've always liked guy-things, and wearing guy clothes, stuff like that. But I tried to be 'one of the girls' since that was expected of me.. but it never really worked out. It always weirded me out trying to be ‘feminine’, and overly girly clothes made me uncomfortable, and just wound up making me feel “hyper-sexualized” in a way. 

Whenever I showed any curiosity about sexuality and gender it was also swiftly and harshly dealt with, and I quickly ""learned"" that it was bad, nasty or ugly and not to be explored or questioned. Which ofc lead to even more denial on my part.. the emotional abuse was enough as it was, both at home and at school. I didn’t fit anywhere.. 

Fast forward a few years, past more than a few traumas (that landed me with a hefty case of ptsd that I still struggle with), to today. After a lot of therapy I've started to dig myself out of denial-land and started to realize quite a few things.. the first that I might be gender fluid, or that I might be trans gender? I honestly have no idea.. this is all new and unexplored territory, and I've been spending a lot of time reading pretty much anything I can come across about these things. If they apply to me, how I feel about it (how I feel at all). 

And ofc whenever I start to think seriously about these things, that little critical voice in the back of my mind always comes back.. “why do you care? why is this important? you’re genetically female and you like men, this shouldn’t be a problem”. But it is.. I don’t know who I am.. but I feel so silly about being 28 and still not knowing. Everyone else seems to be figuring out this stuff so much sooner, and just *knowing* more certainly. And I keep thinking about the girly things I actually do like.. but do I have girly-sides to me because I’m gender fluid, or simply because I am physically a girl. Hormones and shit.. Why should it bother me that I have girly sides? Aren’t I a girl after all? 

I don’t know.. I don’t really have any gender dysphoria going on either.. much.. I think.. I might have a bit of an issue with my boobs. And strangely I’ve been feeling so much better after I shaved parts of my head. I now have a sort of dreads-sidecuts thing going on.. it doesn’t look very feminine tho, that’s for sure x) 
I don’t think I have any desire for a gender change, although I have wondered what it would be like to be a guy. I’ve had dreams about having ‘guy-parts’. Would I be a gay guy in that case? I think so..or maybe bi. There’s a lot of confusion on that part in general too.. I’ve talked to some of my closest friends about this stuff and they’re very accepting and nice about it, but they don’t really know what to say (not that I blame them for *that* at all.. I wouldn’t know either). And sometimes I've gotten the occasional “you’re such a guy your bf is practically gay” (which is only meant lovingly, and I’ve found it reassuring to hear). 

So.. if anyone here has any insights or helpful tips or whatever, it would be much appreciated. Tbh I just needed to get all this stuff off my chest.

I've heard some people get upset at that idea, but I think it works quite well, if we separate the words ""female"" and ""women"" and make them no longer be synonyms.

For example, if you're a trans man, you're a female man. It doesn't make you less of a man or anything like that, it just means you were born with two X chromosome and a vagina, and thus, your sex is female. A manly, manly female.

Furthermore, a male woman is a woman, a female genderqueer is genderqueer, an intersex man is a man, and so on.

Basically, the idea is: Female and Male apply to sex, not gender, for ease of communication, especially with doctors and nurses who need to check a box on a clipboard for your care, or perhaps if you're sexually interested in someone but only attracted to one sex, rather than gender, so they want to know what's going on down there before things get serious.

The obvious fact that your genitals and chromosomes aren't the business of people who have no business knowing about them is still true. I've heard a lot of people strongly disagree against this idea of female and male being words for sex rather than gender.

I am 21, MAAB, and have mainly identified as a gay male since around age 16. For the last several years I have been questioning that identity. I have had general feelings of gender dysphoria through the years but have never felt like I could identify as female. However, I have become more and more uncomfortable with a strictly male identity, and have gone back and forth about it a lot. Last year I took a more gender neutral name with my friends and was open to them about being genderqueer. Having an awesome and diverse social circle, they were more than supportive. However, after 6 months or so I reverted back to my birth name, partially because of criticism from various family's members (who don't know anything about my gender identity, but had heard about the name change and expressed their dislike of it). The other reason was that I was starting to feel more secure about a male identity (though I qualified it by adding ""gender variant"" in front of it) and thought I could be okay with it again. 

Things don't magically work like that though. I've been through a lot lately, including getting medication for previously untreated bipolar disorder and anxiety. My general confidence and happiness has greatly improved. But my confusion and discontent about this continues. I'm afraid that if I keep going forward in my life without addressing this I will eventually crack. The thing is... I don't know how to actively embrace or act on my feelings. I like typical male fashion most of the time, and while I like wearing somewhat androgynous clothing at times and like wearing a certain amount of makeup when going out, it's nothing that people don't just attribute to me being gay. I dont want to change how I dress just to conform to social ideas of ""feminine"", and I guess its more of a body thing for me. I'm fairly tall and deep voiced, both if which I dislike, and more than that I simply don't have a feminine body type at all. I struggle a lot with my body image, and while I would never get gender reassignment survey (I'm happy with what is between my legs) I sometimes have such strong body dysphoria I feel suicidal. Though my parents are very accepting of my presented orientation, they seem much more ambivalent about when it comes to atypical gender presentation/identity, and I feel like they are both strongly attached to my male identity (especially my mother) whether I am gay or not. I am scared shitless when it comes to talking about these things with them.

So there's the long word dump I apologized for, and now I'll ask a few questions... Firstly, is it possible to get hormone therapy if you don't have a binary gender identity and don't want to fully transition to the opposite gender? Does anyone have any experiences or thoughts about this? Second, does anyone have any advice on how to embrace/express a more androgynous identity besides changing how I dress? Third, how can I address this when it comes to relationships?  I am afraid of getting into relationships because I don't want someone to fall for for me only identifying me as male. I want them to understand and accept my non-binary identity and feel attracted to it - I don't want to just have a gay boyfriend who sees me as an effeminate male. Am I over-thinking that, or am I justified feeling like it really matters?

Recently, I've stopped cutting my hair short due to a sudden desire to grow out my hair, and even got some cute bangs a week ago (mostly to get my hair out of my face). I've switched from light binding and exercise bras to basic underwire ""regular"" bras, as well as to more form-fitting clothing. I'm also wearing basic makeup almost daily, which is sort of new and daunting to me. Nobody at school or home seems to care or react much, although I've been getting more people saying ""you look nice/pretty today!"", which I honestly have no idea how to react to other than a quick thanks and an uncomfortable smile.

I'm not sure *why* exactly I've felt inclined to present myself this way, maybe I'm just testing the waters to see if I'm my comfort level with this is different from a few years ago. I really like how long hair looks, possibly because I've had trichotillomania for forever and that was never an option to try out before. I haven't shaved my legs and underarms in months, and so dresses and skirts come with tights and sleeves. I'm not comfortable with my legs or pits shaved, but I'm also not confident enough to have two ""clashing"" aspects of my gender identity expressed together in public (*someday, fuzzy legs and a summer dress!*). I honestly wish I could shapeshift my body whenever I felt a special inclination to whatever part of me I wanted to express the most on the outside. I could have shoulder length hair and lovely curves one day, and then the next just cut it all off and have a flat chest and be five inches taller. Alas, that isn't how it works.

Granted, it's just my expression that's changed, my behavior and personality is unchanged. I just needed to get some musings off of my shoulders, so thanks for reading :)

**QUESTION** Have you ever felt this way? Have you had sudden changes in what you wanted to express or try out?

I don't want to step on any toes. I know some of you are very confident in your gender identities, and have been for a very long time. Understand that I find androgyny very confusing.

So I'm going to make this brief.

When I was younger, I questioned my gender identity, but decided that it would be too hard to convince people I was something *else*. I've posted about this before on here. Here's a few other snippets:

When a friend in aromatherapy offered to design something for me, I asked for an androgynous scent. Something that could be either one. I remember describing it as an ambiguous sort of lift-anyone-in-the-room's-spirits. Also, citrus.

I have [a commented lookbook](http://imgur.com/a/vrkyb). I tend to point out the ambiguous properties as ones I want to have for myself. However, sometimes I worry that I'm just trying to be *appealing to everyone*, not true to myself - some sort of repressed self-esteem issue.

TMI alert: Although I identify as grey-asexual, the majority of my imagined/desired experiences include a sexually intersex/hermaphroditic individual; often with me as said individual.

Judging from the above moments, does it seem like androgyny is a part of me, or simply something I like? ",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,genderqueer-ace,True,t3_z70el,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/z70el/are_my_thoughts_an_identity_or_an_interest/,

So I'm genderqueer, attempting to present as more butch but still consider my body to be female (that's sort of complicated to explain), and recently I changed my name to Tom in a sort of unofficial way. My friends at school address me as Tom, and some teachers and staff are starting to do so as well.
What can I do to make my boyfriend more comfortable with this aspect of transitioning? I think, from what he's told me, he's worried about being perceived as gay, and I want to help him to see that one, I will probably just get read as a butch female and thus will just be ""a girl named Tom"" to the rest of the world, and two, that he shouldn't give a flying fuck what anyone else thinks if he's okay with me? 

Also, would it be safer for me to come out to his friends about this separately, or with him?

I usually put these thoughts on the back burner because I know that labels don't NEED to be assigned to things, but after reading a bunch of this reddit, definitions, I feel like I'd really like some insight.

So I am a 26 year old female.  I have been interested in girls since I was about 7, and my first experience with one was at that age and she was the same age as me.   
As I went through puberty I knew I liked guys too.  I was certain I liked males but I wasn't positive about females although I could not stop fantasizing about them, only in my fantasies I usually had a penis or was in another guys body fucking her!  Finally in my early adulthood I got to experience a few women, manly ones and girly ones, and realized I was most certainly bi-sexual, but I am still nervous as hell around women I am attracted to and it has greatly impeded my self confidence in even beginning to try out a real relationship with one.  Until the last two years, being in a heterosexual relationship with someone whos sex drive is MUCH lower than mine, I have spent a lot of time experimenting with myself, him, and my feelings about sexuality.  I remember being very attracted to cross dressers and (edited) transsexuals when I used to go to gay bars back in Canada (I live in the USA now), but I think all of them were into men as no one seemed to take my advances seriously.  I seem to be pansexual in that reguard...I think?  And then, I still fantasize about being with women as a man with a penis, but I never really THOUGHT about it until recently when my boyfriend took my very accurate looking penis dildo, placed it on my crotch and began to suck it as if it was my dick.  I hadn't been that turned on in a long time.  Now he likes when I experiment on him with anal, which is also arousing, but I feel so flexible now.  I have always been the submissive one, sometimes brutally so, and I love it.  Am I genderqueer?  lol.  I dressed like a boy when I was a kid, and only hung out with boys, and did boy things.  99% of my friends are still all guys, and the girls I maintain friendships with are always a bit dominant and masculine themselves.  Hitting puberty I think fucked it up.  Like I was too young to register the fact that society was pushing me into a gender roll that I didn't necessarily feel inside of myself.  I love being feminine, in dress and makeup, but there is this repressed masculinity in me I feel.  Not sure how to deal with it.  
  
Also, I have a whole bunch of questions to one day ask about my boyfriend.  I won't even get into that now.
  
Anyways, this was a rant I guess.  I really wanted to get this off my chest to a group of people who wont think I'm completely mental.  Also, ask what label I could apply to myself if I wanted to.  I see now that the genderqueer term has a pretty vast definition.

This morning I imagined another person's voice coming out of my mouth and almost started crying. It wasn't anyone that I knew. I just invented the sound.

""That's me,"" I thought to myself; ""that sounds just like me.""

I thought it would be interesting to imagine a feminine twist to my words.

My eyes were wet, but I didn't really cry. It's not right for a *man* to cry in public - especially while everyone around you is riffing off the music. I can enjoy the music too. I can smile.

*Smile*, God dammit.

Last night, I went to bed feeling tired and masculine. I had spent part of the evening talking about my bicycle - I learnt to fix it, the past week - and I spent the rest playing Guitar Hero or card games with other *men*.

I was Moosejaw, and I made a point of the fact I looked like a hobo. Everyone laughed.

And it was right.

I traded the bass off, for a while, to somebody that had never played. He said he could play Hysteria on Expert. He's got this. I walked around a bit, after explaining how the controller worked, (and selecting Easy without him noticing until afterwards). I came back after a few songs and asked if anyone was getting bored.

""Not really,"" the guitarist said. ""You wouldn't want to be a girl anyway.""

Not right then, no. Mostly. Some.

I said, I thought women and *men* were both perfectly fine human beings.

When I was a child, sometimes I would think I was a lesbian. I mean, it was a perfectly rational sort of reasoning, even if it was based off of faulty premises. ""I think I'm probably actually a girl. But I like girls. I think I like girls [I like being normal] more than I'd like being a girl. But I think you can have both? I think that's called being a lesbian. I guess I'm a lesbian, then.""

I never thought you could like both, or neither, or everyone - or you could be both, or neither, or either, or another. It never occurred to me that sometimes I didn't feel that way - that I was normal, at times. I thought the gender binary and your preferences were set in stone. I didn't always think much of it, and I didn't often think much of myself after that afternoon. I knew what people though of lesbians. I wasn't able to speak my mind of the issue. There would be problems.

It never even occurred to me that people wouldn't believe me when I say I am what I'm not. Perfect childhood reasoning, albeit without perfect assumptions or premises.

I always loved things that were split in half. A childhood, imagined super-person: a man who could take anything mechanical or biological, and incorporate it into his own body. The only comic book character I ever paid any mind at all to: Batman's Two-Face. Men and women that would dress up half in their gender's clothes, half in the other's - both piecemeal and [not](http://i.imgur.com/75P1Q.jpg). Drag queens, when I learned about them.

And the people that had more courage than I did.

I like all clothes. I know I'm missing a couple important parts and have a bit of a disproportionate body to be able to use most of the options, and I've always known that will be true. I wished it wasn't.

Once, I wondered if there was some drug or surgery I could have done that would make me always ambiguous, and avoid puberty, at the cost of most anything. Then I learned eunuchs aren't ambiguous, they're just eunuchs. And I was poor anyway.

And my parents would disagree, saying I'm interested in self-mutilation, trying to treat me instead of work with me. I knew that wasn't the right thing to do. Even a delay would be wrong and expensive.

Recovery through therapy is more important than completion. And I wouldn't even get that, of course, just a stern talking-to. It's hard being poor.

Some days I wonder what I am, still. I've been comfortable with every label at one point or another, although I've never shared that with anyone I really know.

So I'm a *man* for them. It pays the best. And I can donate all I earn to charity, which will help someone who can figure themselves out.",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,genderqueer-ace,True,t3_y47db,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/y47db/please_ignore_me_i_dont_know_why_im_posting_this/,

I would be very interested to hear how the language affects discourse about gender in general if anyone cared to talk about it, but my immediate questions concern pronouns:

I use ""they"" now. I am also female-bodied and usually read as such, so if I use ""het"" I worry that people will hear it as a diminutive referring to a female (or correct my apparent grammatical mistake and I will have to awkwardly explain why it's on purpose).

Is there any way I can respectfully suggest that she might want to reconsider her own feelings/identification?,helpafriendout,7,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/pxfdv/i_think_my_friend_feels_obligated_to_accept_the/,"I have a friend who is by commonly accepted standards female and her parents have raised her as such, but she seems very dissatisfied with that identification. She frequently says things like ""I wish I was a boy/I wish I looked like a boy."" She's very self-conscious about her height (I don't know her exact height but I'm 5'2"" and taller than her) and looks in ways that make it seem like she really resents the ""femininity"" traditionally associated with them. Today, she said she resents being identified as female. She said she ""knows"" she's female but finds it somewhat unpleasant or even offensive when another person comments on her gender. 

There are other times when she does seem to be receptive of female identity, though. She will sometimes (rarely) have a confident attitude towards feminine traits and female identity. When this happens I start to wonder if she would benefit from taking time to rethink gender, and possibly discover that she is another gender or even just rethinking what it means to her to be female. 

It seems like she is very upset a large portion of the time in relation to her experiences with gender. Much of this I presume has to do with her upbringing, as she has very conservative parents who have already given her a heaping load of bullshit over her bisexuality. I try not to be gender specific in general (I really only rarely find a need to be) and I am particularly sensitive around her because, well, it just seems like other people give her a hard time without even meaning to and I don't want to contribute to that. I'm sure gender issues would not ease her home and social life at all but she will be leaving for college soon and I suspect that starting to tackle the issue on her own might open the door to a more positive side of life for her. 

I want to help my friend, but I don't want to say or do anything inappropriate or make the situation worse. We only met last year but she is a truly wonderful person and I would be so happy if she found a way to be more comfortable with herself. If the best course of action is to let her figure out things by herself and just be supportive of whatever she wants, I will, but if I can do more I want to. I haven't had very much trouble with my own gender so it is hard for me to know what the most sensitive action is. Can any of you offer any advice?

**TL;DR** - My friend seems to resent female identity most of the time, I think she might be happier if she at least reevaluated her opinions on gender but I don't want to broach the subject in an insensitive way.

----------

**The Growing Use of Mx as a Gender-inclusive Title in the UK** - Version 1.8 - 2013-08-16

Mx was created as a standard title without convey gender connotations, and can be used by anyone. It follows the M* pattern: Mr, Ms, Mx. It doesn't require a qualification or career as Dr and Rev do. The x represents a wildcard character that removes gender. The title is pronounced Mux or Mix.

Example: Mx Sam Smith.

The following pages provide evidence of well-known companies and organisations accepting and offering Mx as a gender-inclusive title at the time of writing. The earliest example of a major company accepting Mx in this document is by the Post Office in October 2009.

I'd like to inform you of two things:

1) I'm fine, don't worry. Earlier was just a moment of weakness so to speak. ((Added for this post: I had a bit of a breakdown so to speak at school)

2) Over the past year and a bit, I have slowly come to the conclusion that I am most likely trans* of some sort. This does not mean that I feel I am a man trapped in a woman's body but that I do not fit in to either of the, what I believe are social constructs we have named 'gender'. This conclusion has caused me a great deal of stress but I assure you it is something that I am currently taking control of. The title, if you must have one, I would identify myself as is that of genderqueer. I don't know if its something you believe in but I do. I am in no danger and would strongly prefer it if you kept this information to yourself. My parents are somewhat aware of the situation but of course, these things take time to understand and comprehend. 

Thank You and I can't believe I'm actually sending this. As you can probably tell, I find it far easier to type than talk!

For a while I've wanted to see what HRT could do for me, but there were 2 sides to this:

- One side: Want to see what changes would happen to my body and how much more feminine I'd look with a thinner waist, budding breasts, fat redistribution around my face, ass, and waist.

- Other side: still happy as a male, dont want to lose my sex drive or ability to get an erection and have kids eventually. Live every day as a guy, no problems whatsoever seeing myself as one

I do hate all of my body hair, would love to get rid of it all with laser, permanently. That I am fully sure of. Would like to be more androgynous to pass more easily, but the lingering feeling of wanting to be a girl keeps eating away at me.

Does anyone know what is causing this, how can I remedy/help/focus it? It's a real internal struggle, no one to talk to about it (can't afford a therapist). Would never talk to family about it, and friends who know just think I'm a CD. I don't have many chances to dress yet, so spending time fully dressed won't happen for a while.

So I claimed this room on the site: https://www.icanhazchat.com/genderqueer 

I set it to 18+, which means not much, except it isn't listed on the main directory, which means no randoms get in, theoretically, and we don't have to police our language/topic of discussion as much.

Some bleak reality seeped in to the initial euphoria I felt from figuring out that many of the issues I'd been dealing with for years upon years - or, rather, *not* dealing with for years upon years, and just letting these issues crush me down - were gender related.

If I could push a magic button and shift over to being the girl I see in my dreams, I'd probably fracture my hand from hitting that button so hard.  However, I think I'm too old for HRT to do much more than some mental tweaking, and have too many family responsibilities weighing on my remaining earning potential to take any surgical steps (FFS, BE, etc.) that the magic E-juice won't help with.

Over the past few days it's felt like the most I can ever do is to be an awkward ugly guy in a dress, in an environment where there'd be almost no support or acceptance for that, and probably even some physical danger - and it would cost me almost everything to get there.  However, the episodes of dysphoria are becoming more frequent, and some of the issues that the initial burst of gender euphoria helped break me free of are creeping back.  The zombie that I staggered around as a few months ago, suicidal but too numb to do anything about it, was creeping around the edges again where I'd hoped I'd left him farther behind than that.

Yesterday I got out of bed before dawn because I couldn't stay there any more and listen to the roiling chatter in my head, and I ran two miles.  I'd never done it before, but I'd read some people on this subreddit recommending it, and I had to try something.  The rest of the day was grey emotional turmoil, but it was at least bearable, if scary.  The monsters were there, but a little farther away.

Today I ran it again, and it seemed to calm things down a little more, make my negative view of the path ahead, while still there, seem a little less catastrophic.

So things are better, but I feel like I'm literally running away from a problem for the time being.  Maybe I need this time to get over the unrealistic expectations my dreams are giving me so I can accept and make decisions on what's actually possible.  Maybe there's more possible than I'm allowing for.

I love long hair. I recently cut it off, but now I'm growing it back out again. I have a feeling no matter what I do, I'll always look female. My facial structure and lack of height and thick hair and curves just don't allow for ambiguity right there. And I'm okay with that. I just don't want to be ""ladylike"" and all that jazz. 

I always thought that once I moved out and got into college, I would go out and buy male clothing and binders so I could look male up until you got to my face. Now I'm starting to rethink that. I'm a sophomore in high school  right now, and usually before each new school year we get $200 for clothing from our tribe (I'm Native American, and the money from the casinos go to my people). I'm thinking about asking my mother if we can buy guy clothes for me this time around. Then I can switch between girl and guy clothing whenever I feel like it without any issues. 

I don't know if this is a wise decision, though. My parents are very open minded, and have been tolerant of me buying shirts from the men's section before, but I don't know how they'd feel about a whole wardrobe or if they'd even permit it. They also are not aware that I am any sort of GSM, they are under the impression that I am simply a very strong ally. I'm not sure I want them to know, and I'm afraid that if I tell them I want to buy male clothing they'll think I'm simply trying to upset this conservative town rather than trying to be comfortable with myself and my gender identity. 

Also, like I said, my town is very conservative, and I'm not sure how everyone else in my world would take it. And my extended family would probably be disgusted with me.

This will likely go beyond the borders of gender identity, and I hope I can get pointed in some good directions. It’s taken many hours of thought and months of considering before I made this post. If I use incorrect terminology, I apologize and will correct it ASAP. I know it’s way too long, but I need to get this all out and have someone – anyone – read it without major judging.

I am MAAB in my mid-twenties. I have an invisible physical disability that affects my motor control on my right side. It limits me in certain ways, but I have to tell most people its there. Since I can remember, I’ve struggled with personal identity, but it’s gotten worse in recent months. I know what my hobbies are. I know what my skills are, and I know what my personality is like. Everything else is negotiable. 

I have a disconnect with my body. I’m not sure what term can describe it. I have trouble recognizing or reconciling myself in images and videos of me. When I go to the bathroom mirror, I have no idea what to expect. When I look, it takes a half second or second for my brain to go ‘that’s me!’ regardless of what I see. It even unnerves me some to see that it moves as I move. I sometimes can look at a photo for ten seconds before I notice that I’m in the foreground. Since I was six or seven, I’ve thought about why I can’t just change my shape with just a snap of my fingers. The only times that I feel less awkward in that sense is when I have some sort of face covering: mostly masks and helmets.

I don’t like the feeling of being limited in the physical aspect of who I am. I don’t get tattoos for that reason. While I enjoy seeing them on others, the idea of permanency with my body scares me. To be clear, I don’t hate my body. I don’t shy away from photos. I can look great in photos and in the mirror, and still feel that alienation.

I’m a costumer/cosplayer.  I’m part of a charity group that raises money or helps others through costuming, on top of many other reasons. I’ve been on local news seven times in the past year, including recycled stories, and a few times in the papers. Becoming someone else is old hat to me. I mentioned helmets and masks before: when I can’t recognize my usual self in the mirror or photos, I’m happier.

The onset of actual self-exploration came rather late to me – I was so busy with high school and university, I pushed everything about me aside for the things I needed to get done. It’s only been in the eighteen months since I graduated that I’ve really started asking myself who I am. Being called a man feels all the way wrong and woman was worse. I’ve often thought of my genitalia so distantly that I think of it like soft clay. If I were to shove with the heel of my palm, it would just smooth out and I wouldn’t care.

One thing that kind of shocked me (and I’m still getting over) is that I’m probably asexual. The absence of any sexual desire at all meant that I had no ‘what I want’ axis to counterpoint the ‘who I am’ in some sort of human graph. Made it harder to steer, as it were. That’s largely a topic I’ll discuss in the asexuality subreddit.

About eight months ago I was introduced to the concept of genderqueer and fluid identity. At the time, I largely overlooked it as something I should think about. I thought I understood it as wanting to sit on the fence of the gender spectrum. I was somewhat wrong, we can all agree.

I should have taken to the signals of having no expectation for my body. Three months ago (which gives you an idea of how long I’ve been lurking) I came across [this thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/108alt/gender_roles_vs_gender_identity/) and the commenters (Ray in particular) made something resonate so loudly I could swear that I heard a tuning fork. I’ve done a great deal of pondering since then.

A little list of events that have poked at me about all this in the past couple years:


* In early 2011, a scheduling mishap caused me to grow my hair longer than two inches for the first time in my life. It ended up growing for six months. I was in a break room at work and was talking to a friend when I mentioned I was probably going to get my hair cut soon. Three female coworkers of an age with me, not even in the conversation all blurted ‘No!’ I was thrown for a loop. They all went on to say that long hair looked much better on me. I have ended up keeping it longer than average since then, to the chagrin of relatives. At its longest, the back and back/sides could touch the collar of a t-shirt.

* I’m happier in the mirror with long hair, the halo of it felt like a mane of courage. I oddly especially like it when its messy, though not dirty.

* While having long hair, I’ve had several people mistake me for female from behind during coat-wearing months. I wasn’t offended, I was pleased. Was unsure why.

* Being underemployed, I got a security license to do more work where I could. However, most security companies had the stipulation that men must have really short hair for safety reasons and to ‘look professional.’ Women can have long hair, though, as long as it’s tied back. I seriously questioned the logic in the distinction.

* I got my hair cut by a new person this fall, and showed her several photos of the previous six months. I was told that if these are dated accurately, my hair growth is almost twice as fast as others. When she cut it to security-job standards, I realized that it looked more feminine to me than my long hair. Seriously questioned myself on why it mattered.

* More and more, I see female-intended clothing and realize I could probably ‘rock that look pretty hard’

* I live in a very LGBT friendly city. One local geek hangout I like had two ladies’ nights that appealed to me, and included the fact that they are both accepting female-identified and genderqueer individuals. Seriously considered going, but some female friends would be at either event and I was so not ready for anything like that.

* For Christmas 2012, this past week, I had asked for a mannequin for my costumes. My brother gave me a headless female one for Christmas, perfectly wrapped so that none of it was showing but the paper was a second skin. My family got a kick out of it, and brought it to the dinner table for Christmas dinner and put it next to me, calling it by the female version of my name. You have no idea how strange it felt, considering they are rather conservative.

A bit of my verdict from these events and thought: I don’t think I have a gender identity. I don’t really have an urge to strive for androgyny, though the idea of gender expression is still an important issue. And it worries me from lack of confidence. In an ideal world, my gender expression would be no different than picking what sweater I want today. It would change every day. Very feminine or masculine, depending on my mood, like it were a red or blue shirt. 

Being a costumer/improvisation person, becoming other people is second nature to me. Different postures, stances, voices, you name it. But we all know costumes and cosplay isn’t real. I know they aren’t. The problem with experimenting with gender expression in the everyday for me is that as a (possible?) agender, is that it’s ‘fake’ – even to me. My current expression, as close as it is to my birth gender already, still feels like it’s put on. I think I lack the confidence to present the way I want because I don’t see it as being ‘me’, just ‘me today.’ 

I don’t want others to see this gender apathy as me playing games, nor as something that has to be super-serious all the time. I have the normal anxieties about what friends (who are largely LGBTQ friendly!), family, and employers would think about me, but I definitely don’t want others to think I’m a fraud for wanting to do whatever I feel like – even if it’s nothing out of the ordinary and call myself genderqueer. My family would definitely be the biggest hurdle, of course.

There are several LGBTQ locations (and a gay village) in my city, and several of them host genderqueer/trans evenings. I’ve been considering going, but my lack of commitment or divergent expression thus far would push me to the outside. I also feel that the moment I make any move about anything, all eyes are going to be on me and even if I cut things off it could all come back to bite me. I’m financially vulnerable and a misstep could hurt me hard.

EDIT: Just wanted to add, I live with two roommates, not my family. My roommates have no clue, either.

Does anyone have advice for this rambler? I have no idea how to proceed. ‘Coming out’ – if that’s what I should call it – would be hard even to my LGBTQ friends. Just pressing this submit button is a huge deal for me.

PS: If you think you know me personally after this exhaustive description, shoot me a PM to confirm or deny. I could use a confidential friend to talk to in my city.

This might well be something of a coming out, too, I don't know.

So, to start it out, I'm male. Have been all my life - I like my beard, I like my dick, I like everything about being a man. I don't have any desire to transition permanently, and I don't feel at all like I'm trapped in my own body - it's not really to do with visual identity, it feels more sexual.

I do like to cross dress - it started out with shoes, but it kind of moved over time, and it's becoming more and more prominent. There are times where I just feel...well, girly is the term I use, where I want to act like a girl, dress like a girl, be seen as sexy. I have a girlfriend, who I love a hell of a lot, and she knows I like to dress up. I've found myself wanted to be fucked, and to suck dick, but not with a man - just with her, and the obvious sexual aids. But this doesn't stick often - I might go through a couple of days feeling like that, before flicking back to wanting to feel like a man. I used to be ashamed of it, and I still feel a little weird about it, but it's lessening every day. I suppose I'd identify somewhere along the lines of genderfluid - I feel rather easy about it, that's the word to use, fluid - like I can happily flow in and out of guy-mode and girl-mode.

When I was little, I mean pre-puberty, I remember things.  Over the course of a couple hours I'd go from stuffing a training bra to shoving a sock in my underwear, from wanting to be a princess to wanting to be the prince that saved her.  I remember asking my mom what happened when two boys or two girls married each other.  I remember wanting to have a penis and boobs, I remember fantasizing about it.

It went to the wayside as I got older. I gained weight, became an outsider, stopped being active.  I started wearing men's clothes, cargo pants and shirts and cuffs and chains, then I got too big to wear cargo pants comfortably and gave in and started wearing women's jeans.  

I started writing gay characters, gay male characters, and it fit so well.  I hate writing females.  I guess now would be the time to mention I was born female.  I think about being a gay guy more than anything, I think about what it would be like to be in a gay relationship, and two summers ago I discovered the term girlfag.  A girl that identifies as a gay male.  That made so much sense to me.  I'd only ever had one boyfriend, and he lasted all of three weeks.  It was probably a good thing it didn't last longer, really.  

Last summer I broke down and went to the doc for anxiety meds, since I was losing sleep and eating my nails, the inside of my mouth (including cheeks, lips, and tongue), and the skin around my nails.  I got medicine, but refused to get a therapist, then I stopped taking the meds altogether because if I keep taking them then I would have to go to a therapist, which scares the hell out of me for some reason I can't quite define.  

I found genderqueer a few months ago and realized that defines me pretty well.  I like my long hair and sometimes my boobs, but I'd love to be a guy from the waist down.  But sometimes I like the idea of looking good and curvy in a pair of jeans.  I'm losing weight, which is good.

Then a couple weeks ago I got a new toy and decided to try it out and pulled up a video from r/gayporn.  Then I started crying, because I wanted what the guys in the video have.  Now I'm wondering if I'm trans, because I've got no idea, and I'm telling myself to wait until I've lost the weight I want to lose before making any decisions, and now here I am rambling on to you guys.

So, I need some advice. Do you think I would look okay with hair that short? That's how short I want it, but I also don't want to get a bad haircut and then be stuck with it until it grows out.

It's been a shit week when it comes to gender issues and I don't know where to even start, I just want to ramble/talk.

There are times when I feel like I'm faking, do any of you feel the same way? Like I don't particularly want to have top surgery, most of the time. I often feel like I'm exaggerating my feelings and dysphoria, like maybe I""m not actually feeling it as strongly as I make myself believe I am, which just makes feeling it all the worse. It's like ""Oh, I really want to compress my tits and wear men's scents and have a packer"" but the next day I may be perfectly fine looking female (increasingly rare).

Some days (like recently), just looking at a naked male is enough to set off the ""I hate myself and my body"" feelings. Especially if it's a fit male. I'm nearly 100 lbs overweight and I lack the willpower to effectively lose weight consistently (I've lost 45lbs over the past year, though, which is something), so I feel like crap when I think about it.

I envy MTF or feminine GQ or trans individuals, because you seem so much better represented in the community. Every day I see something about an MFT or feminine individual on some subreddit or another, often multiple ones at the same exact time. And I envy you and I resent it, as bad as it makes me feel to resent it. I try to offer help on here to as many MTF/feminine people as possible, but it's draining when the masculine/FTM group is so underrepresented. I feel bad about it, but I can't help but feel bitter about it when I see these posts.

I also feel bitter against the FTM community, because it's all about passing as a stereotypical male, but I'm not a stereotypical male. I have long, curly, thick hair and I love it, I don't want to get rid of it. If I were thin, I'd like the freedom to sometimes wear bikinis or other incredibly feminine clothing, while still having the freedom to portray myself as incredibly masculine if I was feeling that way on that day. 

I don't fit into any category I've seen as of now and it's so draining I often don't know what to do. I write about it, my most recent character is a transguy who I haven't had the chance to fully explore, but right now even writing him is draining because he gets to do what I can't, though at the same time I want to be able to switch between a male and female body at will. It's just incredibly difficult to think straight when I can't come up with a concrete idea of what I want my physical body to look like, and I needed to rant and stuff about it. Maybe some of you have had similar experiences or feelings and can relate, that'd be nice.

Also, further apologies to those wonderful femme folks who frequent this sub, I honestly have no hard feelings against you, whatever my post may say. I wish you all luck in your transformations and self expressions.

I am a 29 year old guy, married with 2 kids, and I'm pretty confused :(

Quick back story, used to try on my sisters and mothers clothes and underwear when I was a teenager, i've thought for a while that it was just a sex thing for me then, but thinking about it more I clearly remember wanting to always wear womens underwear, always wanted to go to sleep in them and wake up in the morning wearing them instead of boxers, but was terrified that my Mum or Dad would pop their head in at night to check on me and see, if the covers had fallen off or something. 

I joined the army when I was 19 and didnt really crossdress at all for years, fantasised about it, but never doing it, then when I was 26 I left the forces, met my wife and got married, had kids etc, I told my wife all about this, and she encouraged it, still does, saying that she loves me for who I am, not INSPITE of who I am, which is awesome , we've done so much in the past 4 or 5 years, and she's really made me slowly start to creap out of my shell, we go out shopping together for clothes, i've been out a few times fully dressed and made up, been to a MAC counter in guy mode and sat getting a foundation match in a packed dept store, started shaving my legs for a while and then actually started going out with shorts on + shaven legs, grown my hair long and started going to work in a ponytail, and this weekend, went and got ourselves some matching tattoo's, hers on her upper back and mine in a very sexy + feminine position on my hip, which I love!! This is all sounds great, and it would be, but its confusing the hell out of me, because I just don't feel like a guy, I get jealous of almost every attractive woman I see, its not the normal guy thoughts though, I want to BE them, not be IN them, is the easiest and bluntest (sorry) way I can put it :( I watch my wife getting dressed and I'm jealous of her curves and breasts and long thick hair that always looks good, she's said it before and I can't ever deny it, because its true, I want to be her. 

Not related to my gender confusedness, but kinda because it shows a lot about my personality, I've also always wanted to hook up with guys, talking to them on good ol' AOL chat when I was younger and arranging to meet up but then bottling it, I joined the army when I was 19 and spent much of my early 20's in the following cycle on nights out every weekend, go out with friends and get drunk, slink off to a nearby gay bar and hang around outside scared to go in in-case I knew anyone in there, go back home and immediately get on webcams for guys, arrange to meet up, bottle it incase anyone found out, rinse and repeat.

I've always been painfully shy, and pretty socially awkward at times, always terrified of other peoples opinions and what they would do or say about the things that I like/wore etc. I think i'm starting to shake this now, with a lot of help from my wife, I recently went for a day out to a farm with my little girl, wearing some skinny jeans, a long, blatantly womens, cardigan and my hair tied back and put in some plaits, something which I would NEVER have done as little as a year ago, i really feel like I'm finding myself, but I'm not sure who that person is. 

In a perfect world I'd have a smooth stubble free face, with a curvy shape and some boobs, which makes me sound trans, and for a while I thought I was (going on depression meds after imagining killing myself on the commute most mornings, and getting lost staring into a mirror thinking about stabbing my adams apple with some tweezers!), but I don't think I feel like a woman! :( and transition is also something I don't know if I could ever go through with, unless I was holding a gun to my head every night, but that won't happen as I am not desperately unhappy as a guy, and I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about coming out into the open with all that and being out there for friends and family to disown and the world to laugh and stare at as I pass in the street.

I kinda wish there was a button that I could press where I wake up as a woman tomorrow, with my relationship intact, and my work colleageus acting like I have always turned up to work in a skirt and heels :(

And thats my rant done, there's no conclusion, I'm not even sure if I'm asking anything in particular, I'd just really like some advice on this if possible.

Thanks

Sometimes I feel like I might be transgender, but I also like my body a lot so perhaps I have a dual gender identity. This sometimes makes me feel uneasy, and I feel torn between two different gender identities. I think I could be more content with who I am if I varied how I look throughout the year to allow the different parts of who I am to exist openly and freely. 

Another issue I am struggling with is I am attracted to a variety of gender presentations, I call myself bi-sexual (maybe I'm pansexual? I'm not clear on the terminology). I am trying to figure out who I want to be with sexually and romantically. I've never had sex or done anything sexual with anyone so it's hard for me to judge, somedays I am more sexually attracted to men or woman. I've only had monogamous relationships in my lifetime, so perhaps dating a man and a woman would work for me? I am romantically attracted to both genders. By the way I realize there are more than two genders, but for simplicity in my post I used the words male and female I hope nobody was offended. You are all beautiful!

I am a biological male seeking to hit a nice place in my gender expression between masculine and feminine.  My 6'6"" physique and other physical factors make this difficult at times, but like most of us I like to think that one way or another I find a way to manage.  I hang out here because it seems to be the most androgynous place on reddit, but (drumroll please for the pretentious declaration of how I essentially demand others utilize their language to identify me, oh damn, was that my speaking voice, sorry) I prefer to utilize the term gender-neutral.

Anyway, the reason I'm writing this post is that I'm simply curious if there are any others of you who, in addition to identifying as (insert gender identity here) happen to also identify yourself as Christian.

I do, and while I recognize that reddit as a whole has a tendency to be hostile toward Christianity, I'm simply curious if any of you identify as gender-ambiguous Christians and, if you do, how you work that out theologically, philosophically, scripturally, and in practice.

As for myself, I was raised a Southern Baptist, hung about garden variety north american evangelical churches for a few years and recently converted to Roman Catholicism.  I love theology and I'm fairly conservative, and I know that I always arrive at a few key issues in trying to intersect my gender identity with my faith.

Of course, there's the Leviticus prohibition on the wearing of the other gender's clothing, but I suppose it's easy enough to write that off as being a part of the law, and thereby not a necessary part of the new covenant in Christ.  There are some exegetical problems with writing things like that off, but that's one I can let slide.

Nonetheless, there are still passages in the New Testament which at the least seem to clearly imply that persons of separate gender should more or less be clearly distinguishable.  

Furthermore, it seems at least possible, and perhaps likely, that the writers of the new testament would have thrown intentional cross-gender or non-gender expression into the general lump of ""sexual immorality"" that they are more or less always declaring as belonging only to the realm of behaviors which are sinful.

Thus, while the scriptural text does not anywhere state ""men must wear pants and shall not upon any occasion wear skirts and makeup.  Neither shall any believer express ambiguous gender identity"", it does seem to at least generally hold gender expectations, especially those which are aesthetic, in a high regard.

On the other hand, there is the ever-wonderful passage in Galatians where, among other things, Paul states that ""now that all are in Christ"" there are no distinctions of race, class, or gender.  So maybe gender-neutral or cross gender expression is ""permissible, but not beneficial""?

Furthermore, at the base of all of these questions lies a kind of presupposition in one direction or another on the basic nature of gender-neutral or cross-gender sentiments.

It seems to me that one can evaluate cross-gender or gender neutral desires as 1) fundamentally a part of how God has created certain beings like myself (as more liberal theologians would be likely to say) 2) a ""natural"", inborn and not-chosen distortion of what is ""natural and good"", an indwelling sin which must be combatted i.e. psalm 51's ""in sin did my mother conceive me, in iniquity I was brought forth"" or 3) a psychological distortion which is the result of perhaps some abberant behavior at a point in my life, which is as such sinful and to be eradicated.

Somewhat obviously, I tend toward all of the interpretations of these matters that favor my gender-neutral expression and all of the suits, skirts, ties, nail-polish, cologne and makeup that come with it.  Nonetheless, I feel like I'm always holding these ideas in tension as a gender neutral person and a Christian.

Are there any others of you who hold to the faith and similarly try to express a state of gender-ambiguity?  What is your perspective on these matters?",,False,,t5_2r1c3,False,,,True,t3_1dj5bp,http://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/1dj5bp/just_out_of_curiousity/,

Before puberty, I was completely happy in my body. I never picked my friends based on gender, and also didn't have much of a concept of my own gender. I kissed girls and boys alike, and was fairly hypersexual at a young age. I do remember wanting to be able to ""pee standing up, because the ninja turtles did,"" and tried many times to try to be like a boy. But I don't remember wanting a penis or anything like that. Even still, I'm not all that concerned with removing my genitalia, they bring me a lot of pleasure.

Now that I am an adult, I have a very feminine body, and I really dislike it. When people call me pretty, it makes me upset. When someone says about me that I'm ""being just like a girl,"" I get upset. I feel like I am more proud when someone says something I am doing is masculine, but I don't really go out of my way to try to be masculine, I just feel that typical feminine traits like wearing make up and dressing up are stupid and a waste of my time. 

There have been times when I have wanted to not have boobs, or to see what it was like to have a penis, but I also really like having a vagina and I think that having one feels pretty great. I generally wish my boobs would go away and that they had never sprouted, but I don't want to change them for fear of losing sensitivity.

I feel really mixed up, I don't know if I just feel like gender is irrelevent or what. It changes with the day, and I'm not really sure how to explain it to people or to know how to dress myself or display who I am in that regard. Gender seems like such a confusing thing. I wish I weren't an attractive female, I just want people to see me for my mind and personality, and value that. Some days I don't even feel human. I feel a lot of disgust when people are attracted to my figure. Some of my friends have said that I might just have low self esteem, but I don't think this is the same at all.

I'm a genderqueer FAAB femme.  I feel like my gender is a mix of male and female, leaning towards more woman.  I like to pack, but wear feminine clothing and keep my breasts unbound.  I'm 21 and I live at home with my parents and 17 yo sister.
  Now a bit about my dad.  He's not a hater, but he does need some refinement as he can say some pretty offensive stuff.  He's very uncomfortable around any displays of male homosexuality and he tends to crack jokes.  He's even more uncomfortable to be around when trans* topics come up, to say the least. Again, nothing malicious, but comments about how he doesn't get it, misuse of pronouns, etc.
  I've been trying to offer less offensive alternatives for him to say instead, but to no effect.  This doesn't surprise me, as he's known for crossing the line with his ""jokes"" and being unable to recognize or curtail the habit.
  I'm obviously closeted to him now, but I'm out to my mom and my little sister, who are both supportive.  He doesn't know I pack and he has no idea I want to take T.  And I really want to take T.  I have a clinic scoped out and everything.  The last step before I can get started on that process is telling my dad.  This utterly terrifies me.  I imagine I'll do it in a hand-written letter format, like I did with Mom, and then email him some websites to check out.  Any other advice as to how I can possibly make this clear to him?  I don't know if he even has the capability to understand what a non-binary gender is at this point and I'm UTTERLY TERRIFIED that he'll just say that I'm confused, going through a phase, and/or that my gender isn't real.
