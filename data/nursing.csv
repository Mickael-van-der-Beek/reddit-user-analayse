1367204582.0,288,self.nursing,1dbb6n,"For all you new RNs, grad nurses, students, and prospective students. Here are some tricks for surviving school and the profession.",dennis09x,314,26,116,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1dbb6n/for_all_you_new_rns_grad_nurses_students_and/,"Out a year from school, did a year of med/surg and oncology. Just completed my critical care program and I am now a critical care nurse in an adult medical/surgical ICU.

Here are some survival tips I employed subconsciously that make life easier every step of the way (and in no particular order).

1) You're never going to learn/know everything... Deal with it. You'll just need to keep learning forever.

2) Things are going to change and get hairy, become a duck, let the water slide off your backs.

3) Transcend the cliques in school, become friends with everyone. These will be your colleagues one day, treat them as valuable resources and friends, not enemies.

4) Never be afraid to ask questions, a bad nurse is one who does not ask questions.

5) Do your best to become a calm, jargon free individual; your patients and their families appreciate the calm nature with down to earth explanations. They don't care how the tonicity of the IV fluid affects hydration status, or the exact physiological mechanism of ramipril.

6) Students, don't procrastinate. Leaving it till the last minute creates stress, stress leads to breakdowns. Use this philosophy for the rest of your career.

7) Go out of your way to help co workers. It won't be forgotten, and will pay off exponentially by creating a better work environment.

8) Buy a good pair of shoes, the extra 100$ will save you a missed shift worth several hundred more.

9) Learn how to give a damn good report. The better the picture you paint for your colleague, the better the care and easier the assignment for them.

10) If you feel something is wrong with your patient, ask the star colleague, ask the charge nurse. Just make sure you ask and not dwell on it until its too late.

11) Take care of yourself, eat and sleep properly. Find a good way to relieve stress. Exercise is always a good option. Drinking is an option too, but not a good long term one. I also keep fish, they are almost as relaxing as a massage when you sit and watch them.

12) Blackout blinds, melatonin, and a fan... Nuff said.

13) Students, real learning takes place in the work environment. Do good on your tests and study, but don't panic if you don't retain all the knowledge or if all the percussion you learned is a waste. Your future jobs dictate what skills will become most pertinent.

14) One that may be controversial for the students but worked wonders for me; In school, keep your head down and don't create waves with the teaching staff. Horrible teachers come and go, just because you don't fit their ideal nurse image does not make you a bad nurse, it just means you will become your own professional.
Suck up the bullshit and chant quietly to yourself ""Only X number of classes till grad, X number of classes till grad"".

-that's all I got for right now... I'll update it as I think of stuff. Hope it helps.

1348175400.0,191,self.nursing,107ofu,As per request. The survival guide!,OfMurseAndMan,214,23,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/107ofu/as_per_request_the_survival_guide/,"Those of you reading this are probably aware of the post that was submitted yesterday. There was a lot of interest (for this subreddit especially) on the subject. So... here it goes. 

**What this will be:** A candid discussion on what to realistically expect and how to deal with your first year as a nurse. How to survive, how to become a decent nurse, and how to approach the profession as a whole. 

**What this won't be:** All of the lollipop and sugarcane stuff you hear in nursing school. I won't be telling you how many pens to bring or what kind of shoes to get, that stuff doesn't even matter. I won't be telling you how to study for NCLEX, it's really not that hard anyhow (see, no lovey dovey stuff). 

**Disclaimer:** I am abrasive, I tell things how I see them with no coating. If you are easily offended, please move along. If you disagree, awesome, just back it up.

**What nursing IS:**

Nursing is first a foremost a job. We go cause we make money. If you didn't get paid, you wouldn't go. It's great you wanna help people, but you are there for the money. Realize that this is your motivation. You are going to make a lot more money (usually) than your peers, especially those that are graduating in their early 20's. Use it wisely, save it.

Nursing is a dirty job. You are going to clean up feces, a lot. People are going to cough on you. You will get spattered with blood. Someone will spit on you. You will find blood/feces/sputum in a random place on your body when you get home. I had a huge problem with this when I started, don't be a baby, you will get over it. Know your facts, transmission of illnesses from patients to healthcare workers is  ridiculously low. 

Nursing ages you. And I don't mean physically. You will emotionally mature way more than you expect. It was one of the biggest surprises to me when I started working. You are going to see horrific injuries, people die, people at their worst. You will watch someone die and be thinking of what you are going to have for dinner that night. You will makes jokes during a code. It happens, it's a coping mechanism. It's called Black Humor. You will begin to see patients as patients, not people. It happens, it's a coping mechanism. Don't feel bad about it, just don't let the patients see it.

Nursing is thankless...for the most part. Occasionally, patients will thank you. It will make your day. Don't expect it. Work hard at giving equal care to both the polite attractive 30 year old patient and the rapist in the room next to him. That is your job.

**What nursing ISN'T:**

Nursing isn't glamorous. Most people will have some fun story of their aunts friends sisters daughters in-law that is a nurse and how they think it's great. That's awesome, take the compliment, move on. Realize that you deal with death most days, people don't want to hear about what your day is like. People appreciate you. Take comfort and pride in that fact. However,  few aspire to be nurses. We don't get flashy citations, we don't bring in money for the hospital. Don't look for people to validate what you do, you have to do that yourself.

Nursing is not always fun. You will watch someone die. You will cry. You will be talked down to at some point, by someone far more junior than you and with far less knowledge. Some days you will be a glorified waitress. You will get burnt out. You will wonder, at some point, why you ever did this. You will make a mistake. You might even kill someone. 

BUT REALIZE: That despite all of these seemingly negative things. You will be a stronger person because of this job. You will learn as much as you apply yourself. You will get the satisfaction of being good at your job. And every now and then, you will hugely impact a patient for the better, maybe even save their lives. It is pretty awesome.

**What to expect when searching for a job:**

New grads have it really rough right now. You are going to have trouble finding a job. Don't expect to go right into the ICU. Our job is one of experience. School teaches you how NOT to kill people, that's it. With no experience, that is exactly how you are viewed. Take what position you can get, it will most likely be on a floor. Suck it up for a year. 

Work in a hospital. Unless your lifelong goal is to work in a Dr.'s office, go work in a huge teaching hospital. It will give you the experience you need to do whatever you decide to do. It pay better, you are more likely to find a job there, and you will learn more.

If you are a guy, you will get jobs easier. It sucks that this is true, but it is. There aren't many men in nursing, and those that are are in the ICU and ED. We are still rare in the nursing world, and you are viewed as a commodity. You still don't know anything, so don't let it go to your head.

**How to act:**

Did I say it already? Let me say it again, you don't know anything....ANYTHING! It's just fact. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Experience will teach it to you, but you are very much a neophyte. You need to realize it and approach your new job with humility. They taught you how to place an IV in school? AWESOME! You see that 18 year old tech over there? They would destroy you in clinical skills right now. Acknowledge them, be respectful and you will learn a lot from them. 

I made the mistake of being a cocky little punk when I came out of school. It made my transition much harder. I embarrassed myself by spouting what knowledge I thought I knew. I looked like a fool in front of a patient for getting argumentative with an attending physician, right in front of them. It slowed my learning, disenfranchised me to my peers, and made the docs dislike working with me. I eventually got myself in order......but don't do that.

How do you prepare? With an open mind. Getting this book or that book before you start is a waste of time and money. Your preceptor SHOULD teach you all you need to know. If they don't, then use the internet. Use your textbooks. But mainly, just go in ready to learn. Ask a lot of questions. Concentrate not so much on HOW to do something, but WHY you are doing it.

There are 2 types of nurses. Those that do what the orders say because that's what the orders say, and those that understand what they are doing, and why. Go to a cardiac surgical unit and take a survey of what receptors Dobutamine works on. You will be astonished at how many have no idea. Studies show the more educated a nurse is, the better her patients outcomes (hence the push for BSN trained RN's). Educate yourself. Learn why things work the way they do, the human body is awesome, find a passion for it and you will excel at your job and in giving quality care to your patients.  

**How NOT to act:**

Arrogant. I know I keep stressing this, but it is a huge problem of nurses coming out of school. You are built up in nursing school, they tell you how awesome you are going to be and how good of a job you do. That's all well and good, just know what you don't know. 

Story: I was precepting a new grad in the ED, level 1 trauma. Shit was busy. Things were going fine, but whenever I showed her something, her reply was “I know”. Well, I got irritated as she was unreceptive. So I told her that she was going to take over my patients, I had 5 at the time. I followed her around and made sure nobody ended up dead, and that things that got done needed to get done, but for the most part she was on her own. Within 45 minutes she was in the supply room in tears. That was the moment she started to learn. Don't make someone do this to you...

Realize that you will be disliked by SOMEONE on your unit. Don t' freak out about it. If you are one of those people that can't stand when someone doesn't like them, get over it. Nursing, as a profession, is”catty”. I know no other way of describing it. As a man, I'm spared most of it. But you women will have to deal with it at some point or another. Stay out of the gossip, do your job, learn. It will be hard, but it will make work (and hell, life) that much easier.

Okay, I think that's enough for now. We will see how this goes over and will decide if I'm going to do another. If you don't like this, tell me why. If you want to add to this, feel free, reddit's voting system will put stuff where it belongs.

Then I came home and tried to unwind from a long shift by relaxing and jerking it to some porn. Found a picture of a vagina on gonewild and it just doesn't look the same anymore. Any other male nurses experience this? 

I'm not worried about it, but just found it an interesting perspective. I handled the delivery just fine. no stereotypical male bullshit. Didn't faint. Didn't look away. Assessed for lacerations and skid marks. Assessed the placenta. All that good stuff. Went to eat dinner and then came home. Drank a protein shake and sat down on my computer. Thought I might as well rub one out to relax before bed and then it happened. I saw it and...it did nothing.

Mostly find it funny, is all.

I was so touched!

It was such a little thing but it made me feel like part of the team and as a new grad, what a great feeling! Maybe I'm delirious from lack of sleep and its making me emotional but I just wanted to brag about my co-workers and share my awesome experience with you guys.

I've never really previously thought about how my atheism would would affect my career, but the clash of religion between my peers and me became evident today during an ethics discussion. We were doing an exercise on who to exclude from a group of people to survive in a fallout shelter during a nuclear war scenerio.
All the potential people had descriptions of themselves and we were supposed to use the utilitarian model of ethics to exclude three people.

I was SHOCKED to see that the majority of the class immediately threw out the athiest for lack of religion over convicted drug dealers and a dying woman in poor health, though she was Catholic. Discussion then began about the importance of faith in dealing with patients...in a public university. (I should also mention that I reside in the religious deep south...)

I really don't know what else to say, other than hoping for some advice or stories about how your atheism has affected your career, whether you work in a public or private institution. Any input is appreciated!

I've been an EMT for about 5 years now too, so not much surprises me, or so I thought.

I just got done sending a kid to the cots after she came down complaining of a headache, when another student, about 12 years old, and his friend come bolting in my office. The kid is short of breath, red in the face, looking very puffy around the lips and looks like he's ready to faint.

All I can think at this point is 'OHSHITOHSHITOHSHITITSANAPHYLAXIS! WHERES THE EPI-PEN!? I DON'T KNOW YOU!' His friend is there, in a panic, and speaking gibberish. I tell the kid that's hacking up the lung to sit down and try to get some info, what's your name, are you allergic to anything, etc. His friend answers most of it.

It's at this point I notice a very strange, but familiar smell, I also notice the kid is sweating profusely. I at least chalk the sweating up to exertion from dying.

I'm grabbing all the tools I think I might need, BP cuff, SpO2, Stethoscope, penlight, CT machine... and still questioning his friend, as the kid is now crying. I look up his info in the computer and chart, he has no allergy history, only asthma, no wheezes.

Finally, I force it out of the kid and ask him, 'What were you doing??'

He looks at me, looks at his friend, and his friend pipes up 'He ate a habenero. Is he going to die?'

... the kid vomits all over my floor. 'I drank some milk to help the burning. Milk doesn't sit well with me.'

I sent him home.",,False,self,t5_2ra72,False,,,True,t3_1738v1,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1738v1/two_weeks_as_a_school_nurse_and_this_nearly_made/,

The other nurse looks at newbie and says ""momofone here has been a nurse FOREVER. She likes questions too. Feel free to ask her anything.""


Newbie has that deer in the headlights look. I had been furiously chart reviewing when they came up. But I broke out into a big smile and welcomed her and reiterated that she was always welcome to ask me anything.


They go off to visit the other wings. I sat back and realized something: Compared to the rest of the nurses in the building, I HAD been a nurse forever. There was the newbie, one nurse who is just into her second year of practice, the RN supervisor, and one other LPN. I had trained the RN back when she became an LPN and I had trained one of the other LPNs. I took a minute to think about the nurses in that building and I was damn happy with the mix. They are all good nurses (even newbie, she has loads of potential) and I was glad to be working with them.


It was odd to realize I was the senior nurse and so many others looke up to me a bit. Last night made me proud to be a mentor and trainer. I've come a long way from a wide eyed newbie.

I got out of bed and drove to my boyfriends house to find him on the floor having a fit of seizures, throwing up, and basically emptying every possible bodily fluid on the floor of his room- and immediately called an ambulance (I was furious at his drunk idiot roommate for not calling an ambulance before calling me, and for somehow mistaking this for 'drunk').  There was blood in his ears and nose.  I was terrified.  I had no idea what was going on, seeing as at this point in my life I was finishing my last semester as an art student and preparing to head out to California for an internship at an animation studio.  My boyfriend was passing in an out of death, and becoming increasing more unresponsive as time went on.  I did what I could remember of CPR from when I was forced into CPR certification classes when I Was in girl scouts as a child.  It felt like an eternity went by while waiting for the ambulance.  The paramedics came in, took him and left into the ambulance.  Four more ambulances showed up over the next ten minutes, and each pair of people piled into the one ambulance, every time the door opened I could see him being defibrillated, intibated, and fussed over.

He was life flighted immediately to a bigger hospital, and one again to an even bigger one, and yet another, eventually ending him in Pittsburgh's UPMC presby.  I followed him in my car across Pennsylvania, crying and completely unaware of what was going on. I heard everything from doctors claiming that he must have been using heavy drugs (I would tell them he wouldn't touch drugs, but no one believed me), to a stroke, to an aneurism- but no one knew.  When he arrived at UPMC I was informed quickly that my boyfriend had been born with an AVM, and had never suffered any symptoms, so when it ruptured it came out of nowhere. 

Over the next week I lived out of the waiting room, and eventually a hotel room waiting to hear what would happen.  My boyfriend couldn't talk clearly, and was experiencing living memories in his room from our previous trips to Pittsburgh, such as giraffes and elephants. (Before all this) He was very confused, and only slept when I was there with him holding his hands.  He lived in UPMC's ICU for a full week waiting to have a massive soft ball sized blood clot removed from his skull so he could beginning attempting to heal.  No one attempted to even pretend he would make it, some of the nurses couldn't even look me in the eye while I sat for hours next to his bed (he wouldn't let them place, or remove IV's without me there, insisting that he would die if I were to leave).  His vital signs faded in and out, as he was pumped full of drugs all day, every day.  After a week he had become as stable as anyone could have hoped, so they took him in for surgery.  I was so scared that the last time I would ever see him was now, him with tubes in his skull, tubes in his throat, tubes in his nose, and me with my head on his lap trying not to cry, while I told him I loved him and would be there the whole time.  He told me he loved me, and they rolled his bed down the hall.

There were no complications, and he came out of surgery, and was returned to his room in a drug induced coma.  The nurses told me he was sleeping and he would be for a while, so I sat quietly at his bed side and talked to him.  He woke up saying my name, and his nurses came rushing in to help him and do their inspections of him.  His blood clot was removed, the trouble zones cauterized, and his skull stapled and stitched.  

Over the next three days, my boyfriend's nurses tried to teach him how to do simple movements again.  He was left with full paralysis on his left side, to the extent that he couldn't move his face, see out of his left eye, or even release his arm from a clenched fist.  He could talk, and he remembered everyone, but was still fully confused about where he was.  All of his nurses were more than either of us cold have ever asked for.  They talked to him, they laughed with him, they talked to me even.  I remember one time I got so upset I went out and sat in the hallway on the floor by the bathroom and cried.  One of his nurses came out and sat next to me, put her arm around me and told me how much he needed me, and told me how important it was for me to be strong for him, so he could be strong for me sometime when I needed him.  I dried my eyes and re entered my boyfriend's room to find him laughing and joking with one of his male nurses, as the nurse was using a mirror to show my boyfriend his stitches and staples on his head and asking if he knew what they came from.  My boyfriend told the nurse that it was from a helicopter blade that sliced his head open in 'Nam.  (my boyfriend was 25 at the time- and was not in any wars- he works as a cook.) The male nurse laughed, as the two of them made up fake stories about the war, and talked as if they were best buds.  This nurse was so amazing with my boyfriend, laughing and talking, asking about life, sharing dog stories and pictures (they both had dogs), he asked my boyfriend every time he entered the room if he remembered what happened, and why he was there (probably close to fifty times a day for three days straight) until he finally could remember why he was there.  Another one of his nurses had a fabulous sense of humor, she understood how embarrassing it was for my boyfriend to be incapable of helping himself do anything, and went out of her way to make sure he felt comfortable.  I remember one time she came into his room and asked him if she could get him anything and he replied by touching my face with his functioning arm and saying no.  He then proceeded to get a full on erection, and then turned red and apologized- she laughed and said cheerfully to us ""well at least we know that still works!!"" Her fabulous sense of humor for things that otherwise would have been hugely embarrassing for someone made it possible for my boyfriend to feel okay about the things happening to him.

 There were four nurses specifically that went WAY out of their way to be great to my boyfriend, not only by providing amazing medical help, but also by being his friend- they didn't treat him like a problem they wanted to get away from, but instead they treated him like a person, with family, friends, thoughts, and emotions.  After about a week and a half (it seemed like months) my boyfriend was moved to a physical therapy rehab hospital in our home town.  When he left we was carted out on a bed, unable to move his left side still. (not even a finger wiggle.)  

The paramedics saved my boyfriend's life, and the nurses kept him alive and through their care, and hard work made it possible for him to be who he is today.  He since, has regained full movement, is finishing his final year at college, working at his job full time again, and is now acting strong for me while I go through nursing school (that nurse was right).  These nurses (at UPMC and Health South, his rehab facility) not only helped my boyfriend but they made me realize that I had made the wrong career path choice when I initially went to college.  I am now enrolled in nursing school and am on my way to becoming an RN.  I have hopes of one day being able to provide even HALF of the support, knowledge, kindness, and expertise of these nurses who changed both my life, and life of my boyfriend.  

On the off chance that even one of his nurses is not only on this website, but is able to identify with, and remembers this situation and my boyfriend and I, from both of us we would like to say Thank you.  He is unable to remember you, or any of his stay at UPMC, but I will remember you for the rest of my life.  You changed two lives for the better, and I want you to know how grateful and appreciative of you, and your hard work we both are.  We recently made a visit to the hospital, hoping that we might find some of you to say thank you in person, but we failed.  

If you are by some chance one of his nurses, I wanted to write this to say thank you, and to let you know that all of your hard work helped my boyfriend to regain movement, and he is living a normal life two years and four days later.  All of you nurses are some of the most amazing people on Earth, and even if you didn't have anything to do with my boyfriend's brush with death and recovery, I want to thank you too for every little thing you do at work every day- even if you think it goes unnoticed, just remember-  there may be someone like me who notices it, and appreciates it more than you may ever know.

For the bottom of my heart, Thank you.",,False,self,t5_2ra72,False,,,True,t3_zy9p8,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/zy9p8/a_thank_you_to_nurses_very_long_but_i_want_to/,

The patients and their families feel like my own family at times.  Sometimes I forget that they don't understand basic A&amp;P, and I'm usually good about doing the whole ""explain it like I'm five"" thing.  I have a really good trust system with my LTC hall families, but our mcr/ snf hall fluctuates every few weeks so once you build it they are out.

The other day cracked me up.  I had this really sweet little lady who I had only been taking care of for a few days.  We did labs and a CXRAY, I called her daughter to let her know what was going on and that I would let her know of results either way.  Positive.  Pneumonia, PO abt, lasix, neb treatments.  No catheter for the lasix as we are SNF and only cath for retention, prostate, or wound healing.

Her daughter came in and demanded to see the nurse.  ""ummm excuse me.  My mom has pneumonia and you guys aren't doing anything.  When I take her to the hospital for it they put a drain between her legs and it takes the yellow fluid out of her lungs.  Why didn't you put in a drain?""

I had to calm her down and explain that lasix is a water pill, how it helps move junk from your lungs to your kidneys, what a catheter is, why we don't pop them in just because she's going to be peeing extra, that we are giving antibiotics and nebs and indeed ARE treating the pneumonia.

Truth be it...  you can rarely be there for everyone when you want to be, or when they want you to be. You have to make choices. Sometimes the ones you choose will never thank you or even have the chance. At the end of the day, if you feel like you did your best, that is what matters. Good luck to all the future floor nurses!

1356013264.0,73,self.nursing,1561tp,Rough night in the ER...,Anthropomorphical,91,18,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1561tp/rough_night_in_the_er/,"I've been a nurse in the ER for 7 months now.  I have always felt as though I have done well separating my emotions from difficult thing I see in the ER.  Last night was a rough one for me.  I had a patient come in, a very healthy man whose only blip in his health history was a pulmonary embolism which developed due to an unknown cause last summer which he was treated for and recovered from.  He remained on warfarin to prevent subsequent emboli formation.  Two days ago, he was in a car accident in which the airbags deployed, but he denied needing medical attention afterwards because he felt as though he was fine with the exception of some bruised ribs.  Last night around 10 he walked in to the ED.  He complained of a headache and nausea.  He looked sick when he came-sweating, vomiting profusely, etc., but he remained in good spirits, joking and talking with me.  He had no deficits in his nuero exam whatsoever.  I turned the lights down in his room, gave zofran and fentanyl, and brought him down for a trauma CT of his head, chest, and abdomen.  When he returned from CT about 15 minutes later, I noticed something just wasn't right.  He what speaking as articulately as he had been previously, and his speech was slurring a bit.  I chalked it up to the Fentanyl and notified the doc of his changes (nuero function was still intact, save for his change in speech) and the doc also believed it was likely the fentanyl making him a bit loopy.  The first 4 mg of zofran had no effect on his nausea- he was vomiting in the worst way I have ever seen anyone wretch and vomit.  He stated the 50 mcgs of fentanyl I had given had only barely touched his headache.  I did not want to give any more fentanyl due to his decline that had happened after I gave the first dose.  He began to speak more nonsensically, and at that point I decided that I would have someone else tend to my other patients- I didn't feel comfortable leaving this man alone.  I brought him into a room better suited for critical patients, re-hooked him up to continuous cardiac monitoring and frequent BP cycling and stayed right in the room with him.  He decided he had to pee, and bolted upright in bed (barely able to hold himself up) ripping out his IV in the process.  I called in another nurse to help re-orient him and get him settled in again while I started another IV.  I knew things were starting to go south, and I let the doc know.  CT results came back showing he had a subdural hematoma.  I tried to explain this to the patient, but he did not understand what I was saying.  I asked him where he was, and he told me his personal address (BIG change from before).  At this point, his wife came.  We recognized each other because I had been her mother's nurse earlier this summer, and her mother had taken quite a liking to me, which the wife complimented me on.  Of course, she was very frightened- her husband at this point was not the man she saw when he had left their home to come to the ER mere hours before.  It was so sad, seeing her so scared, and him clinging to her like a baby.  At this point, the doc ordered dexamethasone and fophenytoin IV to reduce brain swelling.  As I was giving the fosphenytoin over a 15 minute IV push, the wife and I chatted.  Her husband was even talking to us, although not entirely oriented, when I began to push the med.  He appeared to settle down and be sleeping, when I noticed that his arms were slowly but surely beginning to posture rigidly.  I said his name, as did she, but he would not wake up.  I pinched his collarbone, nothing.  Sternal rub- nope.  Nothing would wake him.  I pushed back his eyelids and lo and behold, one pupil was dilated and the other constricted.  When I held them open, they seemed to scan the room, ever so slightly.  Not like doll eyes, but they were just kind of moving back and forth slowly on their own.  I don't think I have ever had such an ""oh shit"" moment since I have been a nurse.  He was a textbook example of a subdural hematoma, something that up until the point I had only studied in books.  To see that vacant stare though one blown and one constricted pupil...God.  It was horrible.  I called the doc in to update him, and he made the decision to intubate him before we sent him off to the nuerosurgeon the doc had been speaking with at a larger hospital.  I explained to his wife why we would be doing this, and tried to calm her fears by explaining to her that this if a very controlled situation being done in order to protect his airway during the transfer.  I didn't understand the gravity of the situation at that point.  I thought that he would for sure be okay- I mean, he drove himself and walked right into our ER on his own only hours before, how could he not recover from this?  He's a healthy man.  He'll be fine.  I made the mistake of telling his wife that things would be alright, he was in good hands, etc, because I truly believed it.  Intubation went smoothly, and after we were finished, he was on his way to the larger hospital.  When the man left, the doc said ""he's going to die.  If he doesn't, his brain damage will be so bad that he will wish he were dead"".  At that point, I realized the gravity of it all.  I felt horrible for telling his wife that things would be ok.  I wasn't meaning to give false hope.  And to think, I was one of the last people that this man cognitively interacted with.  I can't stop thinking about all of this.  Nursing care aside, I know there's nothing I could have done to prevent this.  I just feel bad for possibly giving his kind wife false hope, as unintentional as it was.  It's just a lot weighing on my shoulders.  I have never felt this sad about a patient as I do now.  How do you other nurses deal with these situations?  Can anyone give me tips on how to handle situations like this in the future?  I am just looking for some sort of feedback or advice, it would be ever so much appreciated.

Writing to hear myself type.,remf3,80,9,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/z81b8/hashing_out_a_night_in_the_er_writing_to_hear/,"Tonight was pretty busy in my little ER.  This isn't unheard of as a full moon always seems to drum up the business.  I killed my back and shoulder doing CPR on a guy who used steroids (along with many, many other drugs) and was so think I had to throw my whole body in to getting appropriate depth in compressions.  It happened mid shift of my 12, so I was pretty much fried after I was done, especially since I was the only one strong enough to get the depth.

Anyway, later we get in a young, teenaged kid who get manhandled in a football game today.  He had a headache and vomited a couple of times.  The reason it stands out is because the mother handed a note to the registration clerk about him having ""an extensive medical history.""  We all rolled our eyes, of course.  

Before you judge, ERs are always filled with people who, according to the pt's own research, defy every physiological norm known to man.  The pain is only relieved with 6 mg of IV dilaudid.  Or their metabolism is so fast that only 2mg Xanax will tough their anxiety, et al.

Anyway, turns out the kid had a weird form of cancer twice in his life.  Both time precipitated by uncontrolled vomiting.  Mom had good reason for worry it turns out.  We sent the kid and dad to CT and I stopped and talked to mom.  I ran my normal lines and all of a sudden mom just gushed out with every worry she had about her kid.  

Two rounds of hospital treatments had left her in constant fear that her kid would get sick again.  The tears flowed and she explained every fear that she had about him and his health.  I was really taken aback.  I sat down and I listened.  For one time today, I was able to finally sit and listen.  Maybe it was the story and the fears, maybe it was me being at 11 1/2 hours into a shift with a large dose of tiredness, but her story hit me right in the chest.  

As a parent myself, I realized that I harbor some of the same fears.  My kids are young and other than one episode involving stitches, the ER is a place to go and get popcicles and stickers, as far as they are concerned.  She had every parents worst nightmare, TWICE!  I couldn't even begin to imagine.

I sat and listened and choked back every response.  On her way out she stopped, shook my hand and thanked me profusely.  Had I not been a guy (or nervous about such things) I'm sure she would have been looking for a hug.  The only thing I did was give her kid a Zofran ODT and I listened to her story.

I know that we can't always sit and listen.  Medicine nowadays demands quick treatments or large patient loads.  We run and run and run in a near Sysiphean cycle of doing the same shit every day, no matter the department.  And, at the risk of sounding trite or cliches, I was actually given an opportunity to make an impact on someones life.  

Now, it's almost 1am and I still can't think about sleep.  I'm amazed that even after 12 years of this job, I still can find a bit of this time of emotion in my job.

Anyway, if I had something to wish on any nurse, it would be that at least once a month (if not more often) that any of you could have this type of interaction.  My management will never hear of it, I will never be employee of the month and there are somedays my patients are lucky if I shower before I come to work but dammit, today I was able to connect with another human being in a way that other people in other jobs will never be able to do.

I'm tearing the fuck up as I write this.  Ugh.  Thanks for the soap box.  As much as I hate this job sometimes, I love it so much more.",,False,self,t5_2ra72,1346574166.0,,,True,t3_z81b8,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/z81b8/hashing_out_a_night_in_the_er_writing_to_hear/,

We were out golfing, and suddenly, she became sick, started throwing up, and was very cold. It was completely out of nowhere. We had no idea what the problem was.

A few months later my dad tells me she is in the hospital, she isn't doing so good, and that we have to go there.

This is where you guys come in, she was sick, very sick. She wasn't expected to survive, to the point where after surgery she was put back together fairly hastily. The nurses who attended to her in ICU were incredible people, they helped us through our hard time, they were very understanding. However, against all odds (her chance of survival was apparently, very, very low), she survived. After that she now had to give herself IVs everyday, and go the hospital every week to buy her medicine. Again, the nurses there were incredible people, very nice, helpful and overall wonderful people. She made friends with them, and they helped her with anything she needed, even though they could have just given her what she needed and told her to move along.

This went on for about 17 more months, but in February 2012 she unfortunately passed away. She hated having to do her meds, having to eat food even though everything tasted like cardboard now, so I feel she's at peace now.

I don't know how you do it, I know I couldn't do it. Especially after seeing my aunt go through this, I can't stand being in hospitals. You see it all the time.

And that's personally why I want to thank you and your profession. You're amazing people who do amazing work. Work I couldn't do.

I am a Male RN that did an internship in a  trauma center during nursing school.  Capstoned on a Neuro unit, and now finally my first job in a  trauma center in one of the poorest counties in  my state.

With my new first job it has given me a lot of thought watching other RN's work, especially in the emergency department.

That patient that has been to the ER twice this month and you know by name...complaining about pain and wanting that Dilaudid ""stuff"", taking up all your time while your in his room.   You know that one, the life sucker.  The patient type you hate to see and want to spend the least amount of time with.  All you want to do is go and spend time with other nurses behind the station and bullshit about how much you haaaaaaaaate that patient in room 23.


I haven't been through ""the shit"" like some nurses have.  Less than a year under my belt as a new RN, much less an Emergency Nurse.  I worry about myself and my practice.  Will I turn into the gossiper?  The one that breaks down on a patient for something little?  Will I have that firey compassion in three years, three months, or even three shifts from now?

Or will I fall behind a wall of hate for the life sucker.  That patient that has no family, no friends, a cancer diagnosis, and wants to beat your ass because you were late with his Zofran.  Rolling my eyes as he asks about why I was late with it.  I can feel the frustration building and just thinking that at least when I get out of this room, there is an ""appreciative"" family down the hall that doesn't ask for much even when they are in pain.


Perhaps its my ""shiny new RN"" status that gives me these thoughts.  Shouldn't it be that patient that is a regular, shouldn't it be the patient that is depressed and has no one to talk to, Shouldn't it be that old veteran with a drinking problem? Shouldn't THEY get the care they deserve regardless of how I feel?

If you ever spent 15 minutes with me you would understand I give exactly zero fucks about how people think about how I act.  I can be a total asshole and a loving person all in the same minute.  Is it my job to give those hard patients the care they deserve? You're damn right it is.  

This is life, this isn't college, this isn't high school.  Cut the bullshit gossip.  I don't care about your husband and how he forgets to put the seat down on the toilet.  Care for your patient.  If your not in that room, charting, or doing something important your not doing your job.

It is our duty to care for those that can't.  If we are not doing this, we are not nurses and we may as well go home.

Up vote, down vote, I don't care.  Give your practice and your own philosophy a thought for a second.  Go the extra mile, care for that patient that needs it, even if you hate them.

1371126627.0,70,self.nursing,1g9i5h,"UPDATE: Need advice, how to report someone to the BON-- and should I do it?",wicksa,77,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1g9i5h/update_need_advice_how_to_report_someone_to_the/,"[Original Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1fy5nw/need_advice_how_to_report_someone_to_the_bon_and/)

I would like to thank everyone for their advice and encouragement. It was a difficult situation for me, but I am so glad I did what I did. I ended up meeting with my manager the following Monday and telling her everything I knew. I had written down everything with specific times, patients names and medical record numbers, and witnesses. I left feeling terrible, I was shaking and anxious and had a million bad thoughts racing through my mind (did i just ruin this girls life? what if this all backfires on me and I somehow get in trouble? will all the other nurses hate me and think I am some kind of backstabbing snitch?)

There is an investigation going on now and ""Sally"" is in the process of being officially fired. Her next scheduled work day happened to be that Monday that I talked to the manager, and she was greeted by security guards and promptly escorted off of the premises. They took my statements very seriously. It turns out my suspicions were true, and Sally was diverting narcotics and using them while working. The hospital has reported her to the BON. I am so glad I reported her and that no patients were killed because of her actions.

I have received nothing but gratitude from the other nurses, supervisors and mangers. Everyone has assured me that I had done the right thing.

I would just like to make a quick public service announcement to any nurse who witnesses suspicious behavior like this at work: REPORT THAT PERSON. trust your instincts. if it feels wrong, it is probably wrong. Sally was doing these kind of things for a couple months, and everyone noticed but no one had the guts to report her for some reason except for me. These were experience nurses with 5, 10, 20+ years of experience who didn't have the balls to say ""Sally is not being safe."" I have been a nurse for less than a year. So even you new nurses, trust your instincts and go with them.

Nothing is more important than keeping your patients safe: not your friendship with other nurses, not the other nurses reputation, not *your* reputation, nothing. 

Before I reported her I had a brief moment of doubt. I thought about how devastated I would be if my license was taken away or I lost my job because of some mistakes I made. Then I thought how I would be even more devastated if a mistake I made hurt or killed a patient, and how Sally just didn't seem to care what happened to her patients. I knew I had to do it, and if everyone thought less of me for it, oh well.

If you work with someone who is unsafe, or you have suspicions that they *may* be doing something unsafe--report them (edit: *to a supervisor*). Best case scenario: you were wrong, your claims are found to be unsubstantiated and you owe a nurse an apology. worst case scenario: you don't tell anyone and that nurse kills someone.

58 year old Mr. Blue (pseudonym) was admitted from the emergency department (ED) after an out of hospital cardiac arrest at the local bowling club. An automated external defibrillator (AED) and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was used by bystanders to get a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), with a total ‘downtime’ of 20 minutes.


**Issues**
The ED had commenced induced hypothermia on the now intubated and sedated Mr. Blue, using cooled fluids and ice packs. I was receiving care in the Intensive care unit and had pre-emptively placed a mechanical cooling blanket on the bed. I was aware of our hospitals guidelines, and felt competent in the procedure as I had experience with minimal complications. I had a nursing student with me and explained that we were using cooling to ‘protect the brain’ and briefly listed possible complications of cooling such as bradycardia, increased risk of pressure injury, shivering and coagulopathy. 

Upon reflection of what I was able to recollect to the student, I realised I needed to review more research driven evidence for self-improvement. As per the 'Induced hypothermia treatment' guideline (CCLHD, 2011) the target temparture of 33°C was reached and maintained +/- 0.5°C for 24 hours post commencement of cooling, using two sites of core temperature monitoring including nasal and indwelling catheter.


**Reflection-**
During normal functioning the brain receives up to 20% of oxygen and 15% of available cardiac output, during a cardiac arrest oxygen stores deplete within 20 seconds from cessation of cardiac output (Zeitzer, 2004). Reserves of glucose and adenosine triphosphate are depleted within 5 minutes and chemicals are accumulated, which can cause reperfusion injury when ROSC occurs (Behringer &amp; Safar, 2003). Reperfusion injury causes mitochondrial damages and cell death, and severity is dependent on duration of ischemia (Zeiter, 2004), such as Mr. Blue's downtime of 20 minutes. Induced hypothermia is thought to decrease metabolism and cerebral oxygen demand and also decrease intracranial pressure, leading to a more favourable neurological outcome and short term survival (Zeiter, 2004).

Possible complications from induced hypothermia to a goal core temperature of 32 to 34 °C include:


*  Arrhythmias- Temperature below 35°C cause negative chronotropic effects on pacemaker tissues, usually become bradycardic (Asare &amp; Lee, 2010). This was apparent with Mr. Blue whose rate was as low as 45, regular sinus bradicardia, with nil other cardiovascular comprimise.

*    Hyper/Hypoglycaemia- Form decreases in insulin secretion and sensitivity (Asare &amp; Lee, 2010). Strict glucose monitoring was commenced on Mr. Blue through arterial blood gas monitoring and finger pricks, who needed an insulin infusion at 7 units per hour.
    Coagulation- Platelet activity is altered below 35°C and for every decrease of 1°C, coagulation-factor function is decreased by 10% (Asare &amp; Lee, 2010).


* Infection- Hypothermia suppresses the immune function (Asare &amp; Lee, 2010). Mr. Blue was given prophylactic antibiotics.



*   Shivering- Thermoregulatory defence mechanism, can be combated with neuromuscular blocking and sedative medications (Asare &amp; Lee, 2010). Mr. Blue was given vecuronium, a neuromuscular blocking agent (MIMs, 2008).


*  Fluid and electrolyte disturbances- Hypothermia can induce diuresis, decreased renal blood flow can decrease urine output, intracellular shifts also occur which all can lead to depletion of electrolytes (Asare &amp; Lee, 2010). Regular magesium, potassium and phosphate monitoring was commenced on Mr. Blue.

Yesterday I was orienting in the Ped ER unit, and a 17/F OD came in, unresponsive.

As the tech on duty, I went in, buttoned the gown sleeves up, got everything ready to hook her up to the monitor and EKG as soon as the squad was out of there. My female preceptor came and pulled me out, and when I asked her why, she said that ""Guys dont do care on females."" and that it's ""always been this way"" and it's ""unofficial policy.""

Today, a 21/F came in by squad, she had been swimming and dove and hit her head. I went in to help recept her and get VS, and again, another female tech said ""I got this"" and closed the curtain literally in my face. When I went and got the ID band and pt stickers, I knocked, poked my head in the curtain, and said ""Here's her ID"" and I noticed the tech (who was setting up an EKG) pulled the sheet over the patient very quickly.

I'm pissed off. I'm pissed that because I'm a man, any time a young female comes in, I'm not allowed to provide patient care because evidently, men cant be trusted to not molest patients.

Fine, I'll give for the underage peds patients (even though its not like I was alone in the room - 2 nurses, an EMT and the pt's mother were all in there as well.) but adults? What the actual fuck.

What the hell am I supposed to do? Wheres this magic cutoff that makes it suddenly ok to perform patient care? if its not 21, then 25? 30? 35? 45?  Is it as long as a female on staff thinks the patient is ""attractive"" enough to warrant blocking me from working on them?

Why can I do bed baths and wipe butts for 90 year olds but I cant do an acute needs EKG on an overdose victim, or a neck trauma? I dont give a shit if theyre female.. In my view, to protect myself, patients arent even people. They're patients. If I view every patient as a person right off the bat, I'd get so caught up in caring about them that it'd burn me when one codes or strokes out.

Why is it unacceptable for men to provide care to females, but a 25 year old female tech can provide care to a 17 year old male? Why is it acceptable to prevent male staff from performing their duties? Why am I being treated like a sex offender just because I was born with a penis instead of a vagina?

She was up there for a little while and when I came around the corner I saw her talking to a doctor, discussing the plan for the day, and taking verbal orders. I had to interject and tell the MD that she was a student and not allowed to take orders, and that I was the RN in charge of the patient. The doctor said that he asked her if she was the nurse taking care of room 207 and she said yes. My boss saw this going down, and the student lost her opportunity for an interview. I asked her in private why she didn't tell him she was the student and that I was around back, and she told me she was writing everything down and would let me know after.

I round the corner to check on my other nurses and decide to tell one about the weirdness I just experienced. That nurse then tells me that she was just in another room and the patient said the exact same thing. Both patients a&amp;ox3 and ages were 33-66. No confusion.

Here is what I did to prepare in case anyone else ever finds themselves absolutely lost or terrified about preparing.
I paid for the Kaplan review but only went to 2 of the classes so I can't say that helped me BUT the online resources that were available are given full credit for my passing and why I was very confident going into the test. 
In 5 weeks, I did 100% of the available practice questions (Q-bank) and took all of the question trainers and practice tests... and no I didn't make awesome scores on any of them. I ended up averaging a 61% (in school thats terrible in NCLEX prep world, thats good). I also read (skimmed) through my NCLEX-RN Comprehensive Hogan text book doing a few chapters a day.
I took the test at 8 am, it cut off in 75 questions and took me about 40 minutes.
I did the ""Pearson trick"" and got the ""good pop-up"" but that didn't satisfy me so I waited about 4 hours then checked my state boards website and there it was... those two beautiful letters right by my name :)
Good luck to all those who haven't taken it yet and congratulations to all that have passed! Hope this can ease some worries, or answer some questions for at least a few of you.

Leaving IT at 30 years old to pursue pediatric nursing.,hiernonymus,58,11,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1h8uqx/i_found_what_ive_been_looking_for_leaving_it_at/,"Some of the life experience and transition stories I've been reading here have been very helpful with my search into nursing and finding out if it would be a good fit. Hopefully this helps someone else in a similar position find the courage to love what you do and accept nothing less. A life not lived doing what's right in your heart is a terrible thing to put yourself through, but sometimes that’s what it takes to get where you’re going. Everyone has the potential to live life to the fullest and to be truly happy. When I started truly listening to my heart and stopped listening to my culture, the world lit up before me and I've been following it since.  
 
 
&gt;“Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and philosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical gold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering its a feather bed.”
― Terence McKenna  

I used to be passionate about computers in high school and on into college. I spent a lot of my free time on the computer, made best of friends with the fellow nerds, and few others. I was an only child growing up with parents having divorced when I was three. My mother worked double duty in order to support the two of us and because of that, I learned and became accustomed to entertaining myself.  
 

After high school, I pretty much blew it my first semester after joining a fraternity with my best friend at a major university. He was a pretty smart guy and was double majoring in computer and electrical engineering. I figured I knew more about computers than him, so I matched his schedule and failed every class. Then, I blew it again at a local community college, but I did make some of the best artwork I’ve ever done in my drawing classes there. After three semesters of that nonsense, I just worked for a couple years. Somewhere in those two years is a call center and selling insurance to rural farmers. Then, I got a job as a cable guy. No long term goals yet, but I figured I’m good at fixing things and talking to people I guess. After being up on a pole one day in 100+ degree Midwest humidity, I decided that sucked, a lot, and that I wanted to finish school.  
 
 
On to DeVry, which amounted to not much more than a bought degree where previously graded study guides were allowed to be used as notes for the finals - the study guides being identical to the final. I didn’t actually learn much and just packed on a bunch of student loan debt, which now burdens me financially even though I make good money with benefits. I was also working full-time  at what amounted to a data entry job while taking accelerated courses at night during the week, essentially living under fluorescent lights and sitting on my ass all day, with my eyes and brain shot before I even got there. Paying attention in class was the only reason I graduated with a 2.75, which, for the amount of effort I actually put in, wasn’t too bad I guess. I continued my eight hours a day 90 words-per-minute job for a couple more years after graduation, with my hours getting cut, lay offs around the corner every week and then finally managed to get into a desktop support role for an IT consulting company.  
 
 
It was a huge relief to be able to get out of a cube all day, actually help people directly and take ownership as the only IT guy at my building. One and a half years into it, I'm worn thin. As a consultant, I was basically placed into what I have come to hear defined as a “toxic environment” and I barely even want to look at a computer when I get home.  This makes studying for certs difficult, but I did it anyway. This is compounded by the lack of privacy at home because for financial reasons, I’m forced to have a roommate. My empathy for helping people has turned into pessimism and spite, leaving in a bad humor almost every day. I hate what I've become because I remember that I used to be a fun loving, charming and charismatic guy. This was supposed to be a great career path – just get the experience, pass some certs, and make bank – but for the life of me, no matter what the money could be, this cold, static, systemic knowledge no longer interests me at all.  

 
&gt;“If you don't have a plan, you become part of somebody else's plan.”

In the last 6 months, I’ve been reading about and practicing meditation while absorbing as many positive things as I could in order to keep myself sane while dealing with an incredibly narcissistic roommate that had me cornered in my room after work each day because I couldn’t stand to be around him. That is recently behind me, but during that time, I found my heart again. I broke down into tears each time I shed away layers of ego by listening to podcasts and lectures about history, medicine, chemistry, philosophy, meditation, nature, biology and just about everything real I could set my eyes and ears on.  I listen to chemistry lectures that are way over my head but I find it fascinating. I’ve learned so much about myself and the people on this beautiful planet. Now, I know with all my heart that I want to be a part of it in a way that our future generations will be proud of and in a way that our ancestors fought for and allowed to endure. Nobody ever told me I was smart, but when I bounce the things I’m interested in off friends and relatives, I quickly began to realize that I have something going for me and I better damn well use it.  

 
After a friend recently got his RN, I began considering the field and doing my research. My uncle who I have bonded with serves as a medic in the military and works EMT on the side. I began comparing the duties and scholastic requirements of the various fields as I spoke with other RN’s and continued to get advice from people in healthcare. I knew I was on to something a few months ago when I was driving home listening to NPR and heard a story about someone who started a cemetery for the homeless and people who can’t afford to bury their family. That hit me hard. I knew then that my materialistic goals had already vanished and that I must pursue this path.  

 
The relationship between my father and I continues to be a struggle. He is an ill-tempered, OCD, soon-to-retire, born again truck driver who insults me any time I use “big words”. My materialistic and cosmetically augmented mother has settled for a comfortable suburban lifestyle afforded by marrying an insurance salesman and has since started a new family after separating the one I was born into at age three. Her marriage counselor at that time gave her simple advice, which I believe to be sound advice considering my relationship with my father over the years. That counselor told her to run as fast as you can. In my experience thus far, the people that I love, and who supposedly love me the most, are the ones who have hurt me the most. Yet, they have supported me in my struggles. Family is a hell of a dynamic to wrap your head around sometimes, but mine has made me who I am for better and worse. And when you build on the worse, it only makes you better.  

 
Long story short, which I always fail at miserably, I’ve always loved being around kids and I never want to forget how to be one. We are all kids who just got distracted by the demands of our culture or are struggling to overcome some kind of imprinting early on. I’ve always been able to get on their level and I value their pure, unadulterated honesty. They are incredibly smart and are almost never given the credit they deserve. Every person in life has tremendous potential but is often cut short by the simplest of things: lack of education, circumstance, or just plain shitty people. I’ve carried around some kind of jaded attitude toward having children myself, but I always suspected it just had something to do with not wanting to repeat a my father before me type story. During my search to regain the empathy I never lost, and to find out how I can use it best, it seems pediatrics is the best fit I can think of. If anyone on this planet deserves our attention, it’s them.  

 
After hearing other nurses share how these children often appreciate a father figure in the male nurses, it hit me again and I knew that I need look no more. I cannot think of a better way to get in touch with the true nature of the human spirit, both in my self and others, than to share the empathy and admiration I have for it with those who have not yet lost it. Hopefully I will be able experience life in its early years, in its greatest time of need, and death too I’m sure. Perhaps then, some day, I will be able to offer that experience to those who are in their later years, on their way around again, and share with them a way of being that like many of us was forgotten too long ago. It’s never too late to build upon your failures and regain your humanity, if not for the very sake of it.

A few years ago she decided to start her own business, Linda's Lids, making custom patterned scrub hats that give a little personality to the otherwise dull scrub uniform (and let her cut back to a couple days a week in the hospital). She's made patterns (men's and women's) from her and co-workers input. 
  
Anyways, you guys don't need to buy anything, but she is really passionate about this and gets so excited about her customers it's really touching. Every time I talk to her she gets really excited and tells me about all the new cities/countries she's sending hats to and any of the people that have commented on her Facebook page. She loves doing custom orders, you can even send her fabric that you like!  
  
I guess this is a bit of a plug, but I thought you might like to look at some good looking scrub hats from one of your own and the kindest most sweet woman I know. If you do buy something, send her a note if you like it or any feedback, she really does love hearing about it and responds all the time!

I'm sick of doctors treating me like some kind of idiot servant.  I'm sick of bending over backwards for patients, only for them to turnaround and treat me like shit.  I feel like a glorified maid.  I'm also sick of working in such an incredibly bitchy and bullying culture.  Why they hell do nurses treat each other so badly?!?  We have so much compassion for our patients but none for each other...!!!

I've felt like this for awhile and I have no idea how to change it.

Does anyone else ever feel like this?  If so how did/do you deal with it?  Maybe it's just time to leave the profession?

But I set it up for April 10th before I leave. I head home, see some friends, drink, and generally readjust to being a civilian, the whole time the NCLEX slips further and further into the back of my head.

Well, my Alarm goes off at 5AM on the 10th, I have no idea why. I snooze, collapsing into another drunken slumber for 10 minutes. It goes off again with the message ""Hey NCLEX stupid."" 

I hurriedly get up, shower, sober up with some coffee and drive an hour and a half to the testing site. In my Army class of 21, there were 4 women. Taking the NCLEX with me, there were 12 others, all women. Is this what it's like on the civilian side?

I start taking the test, the affects of a hangover starting to slowly creep into my brain. Lot's of med questions for drugs I'd never heard of, and select all that apply. Luckily a shit brick ton of OB and pediatric questions (My best area's) 85 questions and 34 minutes later I'm finished! 

I collapse in my car outside the testing site and sleep for four hours before heading home. Just got my results back today. I passed! Woohoo!! 

What's next? Well I had most of my pre reqs done for my ASN bridge at the local community college. I'm going to start that next May, following that I'm getting out of the Army and joining the Peace Corps.

Let's start with the why:  You want to deliver care, I want to help by advancing the nursing profession.  Nursing is a noble profession, with people that need support to do what we are put on earth to do.   Nearly all of the products out there for nurses are patchwork, it's time to change that.

The first product will be a website that will have new-grad eligible jobs in every state.  You will be able to save your own search criteria which will send daily updates to your email.  The site will be rich with resources and features, but know that these will be hand combed jobs specifically tailored for newly licensed Registered Nurses. 

If you want to be a Beta tester you can get full site access for free.  Beta testers are involved in working out the kinks before a website is launched.  If you are looking for a job, you have less than 12 months of experience, and you have 1-2 hours a week to answer questions, we want to help.

I love my job, and make a point to hide any frustration from patients and, usually, coworkers.  But... I think it can be healthy to complain every once in a while, to keep it all from bottling up.  So, r/nursing, what are the little (or big) things that drive you crazy?

* Lazy coworkers.  Lazy as in letting call lights go off without attempting to answer them, disappearing into other rooms when a bed alarm is sounding just to keep from dealing with that one confused patient, etc.
* Patients who need a million different things but cannot ask for them at once.  Don't get me wrong, I have *no* problem grabbing extra tissues for you, or bringing you a bowl of cereal, or adjusting your bed... but when I have to make three different trips in the space of five minutes to do it, it gets frustrating.
* Patients who have minimum sickness but maximum laziness.  You're here for abdominal pain, you can still push the fucking power button on your TV remote.  *RAGE*
* Family members that hover.  I don't mind loved ones hanging around, obviously, but when I'm in the room trying to get vitals or fix equipment, and there is a family reunion going on that refuses to so much as move out from around the bed, it pisses me off.
* Here's something really small and insignificant that mostly only gets me when the above issues have pushed me to the edge - if I come in and say I'm going to check your blood pressure, is it really *that* difficult to lift your arm?  We've done this before; you know the drill.  I'm going to put a cuff on your upper arm.  It's astonishing how many patients act like they don't know what you're doing when you're trying to heft their arm up off the bed and fasten a cuff one-handed because they just lie their like they're paralyzed.  (This one doesn't count for patients who are actually paralyzed, guys) :P

1371019246.0,40,self.nursing,1g6jnm,"After four months working night shift in the ER as a new grad, I'm tired, scared, lonely and depressed. Does it get better?",countrymouseGF,43,3,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1g6jnm/after_four_months_working_night_shift_in_the_er/,"Beware, wall of text to follow.  
Well, just like the title says, I was hired four months ago for my first nursing job, night shift in the emergency room.  I knew going in that working in the ER for my first job was going to be stressful, but I suppose I didn't know just how much.  

At first I was so excited and eager to learn--a few weeks after orientation started though, I came down with food poisoning and ended up a patient in my ER (the doc admitted me and I was kept over the weekend--after working with him for a while now I realize he did it because his shift was ending soon and he needed to discharge or admit all his patients).  I missed a few days of work and was called into the nursing administration office to be berated for a ton of puffed-up ""offenses"" I had committed, all because I was sick in my first 90 days and that's not allowed.  Ever since I've felt that I'm on their radar as a problem child, probably something to do with the fact that the NM looked straight at me and said, ""I'm watching you like a hawk, young lady, and the next thing you do no matter how small, you're out of here.  I'm giving you one last chance though.""  

Not long after that I went to night shift.  I've always been a night owl, so I thought it would be great.  I didn't realize what an isolating effect it would have on me.  I barely see the family I live with, let alone friends and loved ones who all lead normal day-shift lives.  I'm sure I could probably try harder to get out, but lately I don't want to.  

I'm not enjoying what I do anymore; I've literally helped to save lives but I still feel like I'm walking on a razor's edge.  The other night, a floor nurse filed a formal complaint because I didn't document my patient's NG tube output before sending her upstairs.  It was the first NG tube I'd ever dropped, and it was an honest mistake due to inexperience.  That doesn't matter I guess.  Now I'm just waiting to see if I'll be written up or fired.  I'm afraid of losing my job but I'm so miserable that I wonder if it wouldn't be for the best.  

On my days off I find myself sleeping the whole day away, and I don't enjoy anything I used to while I'm awake.  I spend the whole time dreading going back to work and just generally feeling tired and lonely.  I cry a lot for very little reason.  

I've struggled with depression all my life, but nursing was the one thing that made me feel like I was doing something worthwhile.  Now I just feel like a fuck-up newbie who's in over her head, not even able to maintain a friendship outside of work.  I dread every new patient I get, and I get 14-15 every night.  One night last week I was yelled at by the doctor and charge nurse for taking a minute to get a rescue into a gown--apparently she was cyanotic and tachypneic.  I thought she looked out of breath but mostly fine, and her sats were good.  Nope, I don't know what I'm doing and it isn't okay.  

Then all I have to look forward to when I go home is sitting around feeling worthless, tired, and alone.  

Is this normal?  Is this all because of work?  Does it get better?  Should I be more confident after four months?  How does anyone work nights and have a life?  

Is there anything anyone can tell me that could help?  I don't want to feel this way.  I love nursing, or so I thought, and I don't want to feel like it's sapping all my life and energy.

I highly suggest practicing these questions because they are as close to the multiple choice questions on the NCLEX that I could find!

Just keep at it, and eventually you get the hang of the tests. :)

[Link here! Lots of test questions](http://www.slideshare.net/thinkrn/kaplan-nclex-sample-exam-3)

Edit: I really hope this is seen because it really helped me a lot! I passed my NCLEX at 90 questions. All of my friends who took the Kaplan course seem to have passed right at 75 questions. I don't even know how to describe the test, except that it was very random. This is why I suggest doing lots of these questions because  the NCLEX was about what the priority nursing action would be under any circumstance and these questions really hit hard on that.

Yesterday I got to assist doctors with a trach removal! I drew labs, did about 4 dressing changes, had my vitals done &amp; charted ON TIME, got to do tube feeding, did all my glucose checks ON TIME, and it was awesome!

I had one patient who was injured in a motorcycle accident, who really took to me on Day 1. He made me look really good in front of the unit manager, so I'm hoping that comes across on my application when it's time to apply for the job. He was nice (albeit a little clingy &amp; needy).

It's by username  ""nerdtonurse?"", who originally posted it on Allnurses.com.*




**The Patient I Failed**



I met her one Tuesday night, and spent that night pouring Jevity into her tube, only to suction it back out. Her legs were cool and mottled, her bowel sounds were non-existant, and her blue eyes stared blindly at a ceiling she could no longer see. The MD refused to terminate feedings, but I held them since there was no digestion taking place. The woman was turned and repositioned every 2 hours, and each time, she moaned and gurgled as her lungs slowly filled with fluid. I whispered my apologies as I did the very things to her she tried so hard to prevent.


She knew what she wanted.

She'd watched her husband of 52 years die on a vent, and followed his wishes to remain a full code. But she knew that was not what she wanted for herself.

So, she wrote a Living Will, had it notarized, gave it to her personal physician, told all her friends and family what she did not want. She wasn't eligible for a DNR, as she was a healthy 89-year-old, but she knew what she wanted.

*""I do not wish my heart to be restarted through usage of any
chemical, mechanical or physical intervention...""*

Of her 6 children, one fought against her mother's decision, and it was this child, this one desenting voice, who found her mother collapsed on the kitchen floor.

*""I do not want any external device to be used to maintain my
respiration if my body is incapable of sustaining it on its
own.""*

The daughter told EMS her mother was a full code, and they intubated her on the floor of her kitchen. Once at the ER, her heart stopped, CPR was performed, and her heart was shocked back into a beat. Under the hands of those trying to follow the daughter's wishes, the woman's ribs cracked and broke.

*""I wish to die a peaceful, natural death.""*

She was then sent to ICU, where her heart tried to stop 3 more times. Each time, the broken ribs jabbed and ripped into the fragile muscle and skin as CPR was performed. Electricity coursed across her body and her frail heart was restarted a 4th time. By this time, the other children were there, but the act had been done, over and over. No DNR was written, and the Living Will fluttered impotently at the front of the chart.

*""I do not wish artificial means of nutrition to be used, such as
nasogastric tubes or a PEG tube.""*

Her swallowing ability was lost in the storm in her brain that had left her with no voice, no sight, no movement. A scan showed she still had brain activity; she was aware of what was being done to her. Including the PEG tube sank down into her stomach, and the trach in her throat.

*""I wish nature to take its course, with only medication to prevent
pain and suffering.""*

The daughter who wanted the mother to remain a full code also refused to allow narcotics to be given, stating she did not want her mother sedated, since she would ""wake up"" when the correct medical procedures were performed. Her nurses begged the doctor to write a DNR, and he said, ""the family can't get it together, and I'm not getting into the middle of it.""

*""Allow me the dignity we give to beloved pets. Let me die in peace.""*

I met her one Tuesday night, and spent that night pouring Jevity into her tube, only to suction it back out. Her legs were cool and mottled, her bowel sounds were non-existant, and her blue eyes stared blindly at a ceiling she could no longer see. The MD refused to terminate feedings, but I held them since there was no digestion taking place. The woman was turned and repositioned every 2 hours, and each time, she moaned and gurgled as her lungs slowly filled with fluid. I whispered my apologies as I did the very things to her she tried so hard to prevent. 

Suctioning improved her lung function, but would make her body tremble. Over the next 2 nights, she slowly died, all while the daughter demanded more interventions, and maintained that her mother wanted to be a full code. We had read the Living Will. We knew better.

*""Thank you in advance for helping me in the last moments of my life
to have a gentle, peaceful passing.""*

She had another stroke, and went back to the ICU, where she was coded until there was not enough surviving heart tissue to maintain a beat. Finally her heart was broken.

I took the NCLEX on Saturday in 75 questions, did the trick that night and was pretty sure I passed, but I found out officially this morning that I did! Yay!

However, the point of this update was to share that I was EXTREMELY glad I had memorized the lab values that I did for the exam! There were definitely a few questions I would have gotten wrong (and maybe I did, but I would have had less of a clue on them) had I not memorized the lab values. There were a few people who suggested that I was going overboard - and I don't blame them at all. With a huge bank of questions, it's possible tons of people don't receive any lab value based questions.

Just wanted to share that they were definitely worth knowing!

Also I'd like to return the favor since so many of you were very helpful for me when I was studying. If any of you have any questions about the NCLEX at all, I'll do my best to answer them.

This particular lady is a co-worker on a different shift.



Before the patient had passed, I kept up with the comfort measures, and my CNAs were awesome with keeping her clean and comfortable as well. When she passed, she had the most peaceful expression on her face. She truely was serene after so much suffering.



I dealt with all of the paperwork and such that a death incurs. The funeral home came and went. The daughter (co-worker) whom I had to tell about her mothers passing gave me the biggest hug and thanked me for taking care of her mother in what were her final few hours. I thanked her and told her that I couldn't have done it without the CNAs that were on that wing, and that it was an honor to have helped her mother out.



It was a short interaction, but it totally made my busy shift worth every single bladder stretching second.  That's all.

Am I just a naïve newbie?",combat_boots,38,5,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/183er4/i_believe_nurses_should_be_compassionate/,"I'm a Practical Nursing student. Today was my first day of clinicals. I went with a group (mainly women) ages 19-40(ish).

My classmates constantly made fun of residents behind their back. Laughed at how they smelt, told them to stop being bitchy, they had to eat whether they liked it or not, etc. They called them pet names, didn't introduce themselves, admitted they didn't wear gloves when they should've.

One student said that the other nurses at the nursing home were charting wrong, and she was trying to do it the right way and she was trying to get others to do it right too. Another classmate asked her VERY sarcastically ""Oh, so you're gonna make a difference, huh? How adorable! I'm gonna get that printed on a T-Shirt! Honey, you need to come back to reality!"" They started laughing and making fun of the idea that nurses were supposed to be ""compassionate"" and ""helpful"" and ""all that other shit.""

My teacher said she went on a cruise, and the safety instructor said that, in case of a shipwreck, you were to put on your assigned life jacket and go to your assigned lifeboat. My teacher told me she would never follow rules like that. She'd trip a little old lady, steal her lifejacket and jump in the nearest boat.

I admit. I bought into this whole ""Nurses are honest, trustworthy, compassionate, self-sacrificing, respectful people!"" I'm starting to feel like I'm the dumb little newbie with the naive attitude everyone's going to laugh at. 

Am I just a naïve little newbie? 

(ETA: A lot of people have pointed out that ""self-sacrificing"" isn't necessarily a good thing. I agree. Like, I told someone below, 'Honestly, looking over it, I think that was a bad choice of words. I meant more along the lines of, ""willing to go the extra (appropriate) mile,"" rather that ""completely sacrifice their own happiness for their patient.""'

We have had our clinical day and I just wanted to thank you all for your words of encouragement and support - especially Saeyia.  Your advice and perspective put me in a much better place leading into my clinical assignment.  I can't say thank you enough.

Except for the fact that it was sincere and honestly where I was at the time, I feel silly for my original post.  Obviously I'm more cowed by this bully and by my own sense of powerlessness than I had realized.  When it came time to actually do the assignment, I was already committed to being as fair and professional as I could be and doing the job to the best of my ability, but I had a sudden epiphany regarding my role as lead.  By the very nature of the assignment, my role came with it an inherent authority I hadn't anticipated.  

I don't mean that because I was lead, I was the boss for the day.  Not that kind of authority.  My job was to make the patient assignments for my clinical team and by doing so, I was solely in charge of whether the biggest bullies would be working together or separately.  I was able to find assignments that gave each student several interesting and challenging patients and at least one that was less heavy on the paperwork side, while still ensuring that nobody would be working with their ""partner in crime.""  It was fair, professional, and improved the productivity of our team as a whole.  

What an eye-opening experience.  Not only did the day go better than I expected (not perfectly.  I still had to deal with a low-level resentment and passive aggression from the biggest bully all day) but I learned a bunch about myself.  I am not completely at the mercy of the bullies (or anyone else).  I do have a certain autonomous authority over my own life that I should work a little harder to cultivate.

I now realize that, going into the assignment, I was being kind of a jerk myself.  I was so worried about how these ""mean people"" were going to affect my image and my chances at a ""good"" preceptorship, that I momentarily forgot I was supposed to be part of the team I would be leading.  Your comments helped bring me back to a better head space and changed my entire outlook on the job I had to do.

I was the leader of our team, but in actuality, I was holding myself apart.  Intellectually I know that a lot of it was a reaction to the actions and harsh words I've been having to endure behind our instructors' backs and on facebook, but I can't escape the reality that I am at least partially accountable for how things turn out.  If I make myself small and resentful just to avoid confrontation with bigger, meaner, more overtly aggressive folks than myself, all I do is suffer and end up feeling helpless while I continue to help power the cycle.  

So yeah, thanks a bunch, anonymous and supportive folks of Reddit.  You made a difference - and not a minor one.  I just thought you should know.

**TL;DR**  Day went way better than I thought, thanks in large part to you folks.  You inspired an epiphany because you're awesome like that.",,False,self,t5_2ra72,False,,,True,t3_19l0wk,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/19l0wk/update_to_nursing_school_bullies/,

I have heard many different answers to this question

In nursing school I was taught that any amount of air in IV tubing is unsafe (because of the risk for an air embolism) and needs to be removed before infusion. In my clinicals I have found 1/2 inch air bubbles within IV saline locks and have ultimately had to place a new IV because I messed up the old IV by trying to remove the air. 

I have also seen many nurses push air bubbles into patients as large as 2 inches of iv tubing, and none of those patients died.

Another thing that confuses me is a ""bubble test"" during a TEE. During a TEE I observed, the physician asked the nurse to push about 10 mL of NS mixed back and forth with air (approx 10 mL of air all together) to make it bubbly in a patients PICC line. How does this not cause air embolisms?

‘Twas the night before Christmas, and in each isolette
Little creatures were squirming and getting all set;
Machinery sat by their bedsides with care,
In hopes that good breathing skills soon would be there.

Day shifters were home all snug in their beds,
As visions of overtime danced in their heads;
While preemies on ventilators, and some on CPAP,
Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap…

When out in the hall there arose such a clatter,
The residents woke up to see what was the matter.
Away from the sink I flew like a jet
To make sure all was well at my baby’s isolette.

Some bilirubin lights with their powerful glow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to babies below,
When, there before my wondering eyes, it would seem,
Was an oversized stroller and a medical team.
With a handful of needles with which they could stick you,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nicu.

More rapid than eagles his specialists came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
“Now, Nurses! Now, Residents! Now, Neonatologists!
On, Social Workers! On, Respiratory and Occupational Therapists!
From the front of the unit! To the end of the hall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!”

Up to each baby’s cribside they flew,
With the stroller full of toys, and St. Nicu too.
And then, in a twinkling, they stopped at each bed
And tucked in the babies and got them all fed.

As I looked at my baby, and was turning around,
Down our aisle St. Nicu came with a bound.
He was dressed in red scrubs, and I could instantly tell
That his clothes had an obvious hospital smell;
A bag of stuffed animals was flung on his back,
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
A little red pen he held tight in his teeth,
And a stethoscope encircled his neck like a wreath.

He was chubby and plump, with a few extra pounds,
And I laughed when I saw him there doing his rounds.
A turn of his clipboard and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke few words, but came straight to my side,
And running down his face was a tear he had cried.

And laying his hand on the back of my head,
He gave me a nod, and slowly he said:
“Each night you come here you’re aware of the danger,
But your baby is loved by the One in the manger.”

Then the medical team gave a thumbs-up and smiled
And St. Nicu placed an animal next to my child.
But I heard him exclaim, as they rolled out of sight,
“Merry Christmas, tiny baby, and have a wonderful night!” ",,False,self,t5_2ra72,False,,,True,t3_15fir8,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/15fir8/merry_christmas_nicu_nurses_i_have_a_poem_for_you/,

It was very stressful for her because out of 300+ people they took around 40 to enter the program. It's so competitive and I cannot explain how proud I am of her. At the moment, I'm 22 and just graduated with an engineering degree and next week I'll be returning for my masters in engineering. It should only take no more than 4 quarters (graduate winter 2013) and then I'll go off to work after that while she is finishing school. She was accepted to her program this summer and has just started her 3-year nursing program at her school. We both know, and have already experienced, how much hard work our majors entail and how they are very demanding in terms of time and effort. However, nursing is much different than engineering in terms of what type of knowledge is learned. Instead of math and numbers, it's human anatomy and symptoms (along with so much more). I would love to know what kinds of things she'll be learning and how best to support her and keep our relationship strong. For example, yesterday she was going over what one of her class' activities is and she has to bring a bathing suit and bathroom supplies, for what we assume, is the students practicing bathing each other to learn how to do it correctly on patients. My ultimate goal here is to find out what other things she'll be doing so I can be prepared.

I know she wants to be a nurse more than anything and I have tried to be her biggest supporter through everything and I want to continue to do so. If you could provide any insight on what's going to happen in the next few years and any advice to make things easier on her, and our relationship, so she can succeed, I would be more than grateful.",,False,self,t5_2ra72,False,,,True,t3_zpoxh,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/zpoxh/girlfriend_of_7_years_has_just_entered_the/,

I'm a (mostly) healthy 23 year old F. In 2009, I caught measles after a freak outbreak (I had never had a booster shot coincidentally, and caught it from a little girl who was at the mall). After 5 days of consistently high fever, I decided to go to the emergency department. This was also around the time the swine flu was going around, so I was quarantined while the doctor ran some tests. My fever was 104F. The doctor asked me if I wanted to leave or stay, and I said I would come back the next day to run some more tests. Just as I was about to leave, I promptly fainted. They definitely made me stay then lol. But I had to practically beg for an IV drip so I wouldn't get weak (I wasn't able to digest anything but tea and toast). 

The next day, when I was supposed to be discharged, one nurse helped me get up and walk around the hospital. She reassured me the entire way, and showed incredible patience with my awkward, slow and dizzy steps. I leaned on her shoulder for support. It has been 4 years since that day, but I still remember her kindness. I wish I could hug and thank her now (was too sick at the time to process what was happening) but simply cannot remember her name.

Although that time in the hospital was absolutely miserable, it is crazy how I am still able to remember her after all these years. It is truly a thankless job, but I hope this helps someone reading this realize that YOU DO make an impact on your patient's lives.

TL;DR Was incredibly sick 4 years ago, nurse that took care of me at the hospital left a permanent imprint in my mind.

This might help some of you.  While this letter was written specifically for her resume, the concepts still apply to everyone...even people who aren't in healthcare.  I've helped a lot of my friends land killer jobs after I helped them with their resume.  One internal recruiter told my engineering buddy that he had the best resume she had ever seen....and he even paid someone $1,000 to write the resume that I made better.  Here's the text if you want to read it:

When I help people with their resumes I tell them, ""I can't write this for you.  I can only steer you to help you make it better for yourself."" So here's my advice.  First off, it just looks like a wall of text.  Someone in HR is NEVER going to read this entire resume.  There's just too much to read and they read dozens of resumes every day.  They don't have time to read them all word for word.  Also, When you state the position title (like ""medical staff associate"" or ""student nurse"" or ""reception technician"") I know what those positions are, and so do all of the other people who are going to be reading your resume.  You don't need to give me a recap of the things you did when you were there.  I already know what you did.  You did the same thing as the last ""reception technician"" I hired for the hospital.  You need to tell me the things you did WELL.  Like the part on reception technician where you said, ""ranked top three technicians for screens per hour.....""   That is information that I WANT to know and you have it buried as the last thing you tell me under a bunch of stuff that I don't care about.  The best thing you did at that job (rank at the top) is the last thing you told me about.  Why?  Make it the first thing you tell me.  You're a new grad.  You and every other new grad's resume that I see did the exact same thing.  I want to know what sets you apart.  What makes you different and better than the last resume I screened?  No one is going to look at your resume and say, ""Oh wow, she knows how to do endotracheal suctioning!""  Because you really don't know how to do it.  You may be familiar with it, but you didn't do it day in and day out for a year.  You did it for a couple of weeks.  So that isn't going to get you hired.  If you can think back to school and think of what you did WELL (and be able to quantify it....like you did in the ""top three"" statement, then that is the stuff that needs to be on your resume.  Everything else is just wasting the resume reader's time.  Also, nobody cares about you having your BLS.  Everyone has their BLS.  No one cares that you had your fingerprints recorded.  Everyone has that.  That's just wasting space on your resume.  Also, under skills you need to change that to ""Keywords"" and have a list of keywords that a recruiter's software is going to flag.  That's where you can put things like, ""eclampsia, endotracheal suctioning, critical care, intensive care, etc.""   Under certifications I would put ""Current: BLS, AZ RN license"" and that's it.  Look at how much space that saves!   Also, forget about cliche wording like ""problem solving skills.""  If you know how to solve problems, then tell me about a problem that you solved.  Give me instances in which your problem solving skills caused you to solve a problem.  Quantify.  Also, think long and hard about what I'm about to say:  ""There is a big difference between what you want to tell a future employer, and what they want to know.""  Put the things on your resume that THEY WANT TO KNOW, not what you want them to know.  They want to know how you are going to come in and kick ass and be the best nurse they've ever hired.  Show them how that is possible.  Put THOSE things on your resume.  Don't tell me what you did in school because I already know what you do in school.  You do the same thing every other new graduate did.  Tell me what you did *well*.  I hope this helps. 

p.s.  I didn't read your cover letter because nobody else is going to either.   If you're writing a cover letter it should be written specifically for the job/physician/hiring manager that is hiring.  It shouldn't be a blanket, ""Hi, This is why a random employer should hire me.""  It should be, ""Dr. Smith, I am familiar with your orthopedic practice here in Anycity, USA.  Let me tell you why I would love to work with you....""


I hope this helps.

Scared I wouldn't be able to stay up, keep up my usual pace, be on top of things. Mostly though, I really didnt want to have to wake people up when they are resting.

To my surprise I enjoyed night shift.

So anyway, the night shift was not as bad as I thought... actually I liked it. I enjoyed the option to give a bed bath to a bedbound patient who wanted it, and give them the time they needed because many others were sleeping. I enjoyed the interesting people I worked with. I also liked to see the dedicated families that stay overnight with their loved one. 

Of course I didnt like the lack of time I have with my own life.. but that would happen anyway with 12 hr shifts for those days. I got back on a regular night sleep the day after, so that wasnt too bad either. 

I am excited to be a night nurse!

I have reported 2 cards myself, and nothing has been done. This week I had some personal issues with the Administrator and have worried about retaliation on a professional level, and tonight when I came in it turned out another card was missing. Only people with access were the key-restricted nurse, who should NOT have had the keys but did for an hour, 2 CMA's and myself. For some reason this time they launched a full out investigation, and showed up to do random UA drug screens. I was the only one to pass my UA, and the others had opiates in their urine. Key-restricted has a convenient script for Lortab. Somehow instead of being cleared by my clean UA the focus has switched to if I may be selling the pills, because I mentioned I am broke this week. I think if I was selling drugs I wouldn't be broke, but that logic doesn't seem to make sense to them. I am truly scared for my license for many more reasons than just this instance, this is the worst hell hole I have ever worked, and am now to the point where I just don't want to come back to work. Would  it hurt me to just quit? Is there anything I can do or anything I should be worried about? To be clear, I did not take the damn narcs.  Sorry for the length, I am very frustrated right now.

1354704805.0,28,self.nursing,14bfwn,Some general advice for potential nurses,schlingfo,39,11,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/14bfwn/some_general_advice_for_potential_nurses/,"I see many submissions coming down the pipe with people asking advice about pursuing a career in nursing.

I thought I would put together a bit of information all in one place with this thread.

1)For anyone considering a career in nursing, I can't stress enough to shadow a nurse.  Shadow a nurse who works in a hospital.  That's where you're likely to work at some point in your career, and it's important to know exactly what to expect prior to starting school and shelling out a significant chunk of change.

2)Pursue your BSN.  I repeat, pursue your BSN.  An ADN is becoming increasingly worthless.  None of the major city hospitals where I work will hire ADNs, and there aren't many outlying suburban hospitals that will hire them in this area.

Yes, it can be hard due to various life situations.  If you are limited financially, your best bet is to complete your pre-requisites at a community college and then apply to the BSN program, many of which are as short as 15 months.  You will have to rely on student loans/savings/financial aid for a little over a year, but it's a much better alternative than trying to find a job as an ADN, all while knowing you're going to have to go back to school again to get your BSN.

3)Pick a school that is located near as many large hospitals as possible.  Clinical rotations are key to preparing for your position as a graduate nurse, and you don't want to be scrounging for clinical spots or be doing rotations in small hospitals with a lowish acuity level.

4)Ensure you have volunteer or other medical experience prior to applying to a nursing program, and ensure your grades are top notch.  The programs are EXTREMELY competitive.  My class had around 3,000 applicants for about 120 seats.  You weren't getting in with anything less than a 3.7, and you weren't getting in if you didn't have any experience in a healthcare environment.

5)When you are accepted into a program, expect to put in about 40-60 hours a week studying.  Speaking as someone who was a chemist and a medic in the military prior to becoming a nurse, the program is intense and if you don't make the most of your opportunity to study, it will reflect in your practice.

6)Make a couple of close friends in your nursing program.  It's going to be stressful, and having a couple of people with whom you can discuss things helps immensely.  You'll realize that you're not the only person struggling, and it will definitely ensure a healthier state of mind.

Those are the big ones I can think of for potential nurses.

TL;DR: Shadow, BSN, big hospitals, good grades, study, friends",,False,self,t5_2ra72,False,,,True,t3_14bfwn,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/14bfwn/some_general_advice_for_potential_nurses/,

This bothers me because, while I believe stats is a useful discipline that has its place, when I look at the elementary probability theory and extremely superficial flirtation with inferential statistics that comprise your typical elementary stats course, I can't imagine what a nurse would ever use it for.

Can r/nursing help me out here? Do you use stats to fulfill your day-to-day responsibilities? I'd like to make my class useful to my students if possible. Are there any topics you wish you had seen in your stats class that didn't get covered?

I was a bystander at the scene of a brutal motorcycle accident today.  The motorcyclist was probably going 55 mph while a guy going 35 mph turned into him, throwing him off the bike.  When I ran up to the guy, he was pretty much a mess (broken bones, not breathing).  Helmet was a foot away from him.  I pinched him arm to keep him alert.  
The cops showed up ushering us away. 
I have received news that he has passed, but i'm wondering.  If i had performed CPR on him right after the accident, would  there have been a chance he survived?

EDIT: Thank for your feedback, guys.  I've really been asking myself this question all day: Why didn't I do CPR?  I am a first year nursing student, and I do know CPR.  I could have jumped on him and started.  I was more focused on keeping him alert.  I feel quite guilty. 
He was not alert and when i went up to him he had around 3 bpm.  Very raspy and labored. That went on for about 4 minutes before the cops arrived.  
What made my dad frustrated was that when the cops arrived, they took one look at him and decided not to do CPR.  I believe that the paramedics performed CPR once they arrived after the cops.

I'm looking for stories about when you've committed errors, what happened to cause them, what the results were, and how they were handled by you and administration.  What would you do differently? How did it feel? 

I had a doozy of a medication error last week. I administered the wrong IV med at the wrong rate.  Thank God the dosage wasn't dangerous and the patient experienced no adverse effects.   I got a warning because I didn't follow the five rights. Which is true and something I deserve. I get that... I'm human, I make mistakes, I'm very lucky and because of this I'll do better.  

My nurse manager gave me an added penance. She wants me to do a poster about med errors and safety for the unit. Instead of doing the usual ""med errors are bad! Follow the five rights!"" I want to create something that underlines the fact that no one intends to do this, it's easy to be distracted and make mistakes, and this has happened to many people. In order to do that, I want to include anecdotal evidence and I was hoping to share your stories.

It feels like I'm taking a massive leap of faith as obviously I'm going to spend another two years in student poverty, and I'm saying my goodbyes to the world of laboratory work but I know Nursing is the best option for me and it will grant me so many opportunities which science will never be able to provide.  Additionally and most importantly I'm actually going to have a career where I feel like I'm doing something worthwhile, which I never experienced being in the lab, I just felt like a drone.

First, the back story:

1995-1996: CNA, Home Health Aid, Nursing home ass wiper.
1996-1998: EMT-B large city EMS going to Community College
1998-2004: Paramedic, worked in several large cities on the east coast
2004-2008: US Army Combat Medic. Baghdad 2005-2006
2008-2010: Finished BSN, obtained RN
2010-Present: RN,  Neuro ICU, Case Manager, Trauma Coordinator

All my adult life, I have scratched and clawed my way through this system trying to ""leave my mark"", only wanting to be involved in high end medicine, you know, the glory seeker mentality. Always trying to be the most bad ass dude on the block so to say. No fucking Med-Surg work for me. 

At 35 years old, I am left a jaded, cynical asshole. Only pleasant to the patients, a complete jerk to everyone else. Left with very little social graces. I have seen every horrible thing one human can do to another, I've seen every horrible thing a human can do to themselves, and I have seen the horror of war. I have treated strangers, I have treated family members, I have treated my ""enemies"". 

I left clinical nursing (not too far along in the old nursing career...lol) about eight months ago in order to try to begin to heal my fractured soul. It has been a hard road and I have the tendency to romanticize all the things I was doing in the past. Despite the damage I have done to myself as a human being I couldn't drag myself away from the nightmare. That's how I got tangled up in the trauma department as a coordinator. 

This week I saw 2 PAs quit their jobs, and a Trauma Service Program Director completely disregard everything that is really important about people simply to keep the department running. Everyone, everything, and every patient be damned, as long as the department looks good to the College. So, I quit as well, and went back to in patient case management.

I met a patient today that for some reason really hit me hard. He is a man about my age who is going to die in less than a year. He was in the hospital to build up his strength so that he could use what little time he has left on this earth enjoying his family. Nothing else mattered to him. Any treatment must be focused toward building strength and stamina, and then discharge. I mean, if you only have a few months to live, who the hell wants to spend them in a hospital?

The things this man is searching for are things we all tell ourselves that we hold dear to our hearts as well. When it comes down to it though, we are probably always lying to ourselves. That shit isn't important until you are shitting yourself, and feeling like an ass because you did something else instead of attend your daughter's first dance recital.

So, here I am, a piddly little case manager in a short term stay surgical unit. Do I make a lot of difference in my patient's lives? If I wasn't there, would it have a huge affect on them?  As Chuck Testa says, ""NOPE""

You know what though? I do help people, I do make a positive contribution to society, and I will never feel bad about being a ""minor player"". I've been on the other side of the warm up bench, and it's fucking hell.

If you made it this far, thank you for reading. I feel better just having gotten this off my chest. Maybe it will help someone else, who knows. 

What I know is that right now, I'm going to have a glass of wine and watch a movie with my kids. ",,False,self,t5_2ra72,False,,,True,t3_sj6wi,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/sj6wi/reflecting_on_16_years_of_seeking_nonexistent/,

I worked adult medical surgical for a year, disliked it immensely, however it truly gave me a foundation so when I progressed I had skills and knowledge to build upon. I feel sad for many new grads who are excited to graduate, pass their NCLEX and land their dream job and to struggle building confidence and the be nurse they aspire to be. 

Am I the only one who thinks we are doing new grads a disservice by hiring them into high acuity roles right out of school? Yes I understand some are successful, but wouldn't it be better to provide building blocks before taking care of critically ill patients - our new nurses would be better and more confident and our patients would be receiving better care.

**TLDR: Nurse that works on my unit is practicing unsafely, either with extreme exhaustion or using drugs while working. Has made huge, careless mistakes that have adversely affected patients. I have reported her to my supervisors, if she is not fired and reported to the BON by them, can I and how do I report her myself?**

There is a nurse on my unit, I will call her Sally. Sally has been a nurse for maybe 2 years. She has always been slightly lazy and careless, puts blame on the PCAs for her mistakes, leaves a lot of things for the night shift that she shouldnt, etc.

Everyone has kind of been letting her slide for a while because she's going through some personal issues at home I guess. She forgets to give some meds, night shift just gives them late. She didn't do all of her admission paperwork, night shift finishes it. She gives a shitty report, night shift knows to do their research before getting report from her. The list goes on, whatever, some people make mistakes and forget things.

The past couple weeks have been exponentially terrible. She literally NODS OFF during report. Repeats herself several times without remembering, doesnt know pertinent info on the patient, doesnt pass said info on to night shift, doesnt check new orders during her 12 hour shift, etc. it is very frustrating, but last night just takes the cake.

in the midst of getting a shitty, worthless report from her last night, I see that one of my patients to be had a blood sugar of 495 at 1600 and did not receive insulin yet as of 1900. This patient was admitted for severe hyperglycemia, it is his main issue. I ask what the deal is, Sally says a doctor was just in the room and she was waiting on the doctor to change to insulin orders before giving it. okay... When she left i immediately went in his room, rechecked sugar and gave the insulin as ordered. I had to skip his 2200 insulin because his sugar was ~100 at that time. I look in the chart and the endocrinologist had been to see the patient at 1700 and wrote an order that said ""give ordered insulin NOW, recheck sugar at 2030 and call back with results."" Pt ended up with a blood sugar of &lt;30 at midnight, had to call rapid response and give dextrose IV and monitor blood sugar q1h all night. Patient was a little confused (baseline), but he said he was so hungry and that he had not eaten anything all day. He is blind and an assist to feed, and I kind of believe him.

Another patient had an order for IV lasix q12h, profiled as 0900 and 2100. My 2100 dose was coming up as due, but it was charted that she gave the 0900 dose at 1900! I asked the patient if Sally had given her lasix in her IV around 7pm, and she said no, she hadnt seen Sally for hours, just once in the morning. WTF. I definitely didnt want to double dose the patient, so I called Sally at home and asked if she had given it, she said no, definitely not. She said she ""thought she cleared it off."" Why the fuck would you chart that you gave something you didnt give. Why would you chart it 10 hours after it was due? her response, ""I dont know."" I talked to my charge nurse, decided to give it and closely monitor B/P and urine output all night. Pt was okay.

Backtrack to before report, I hear a call bell go off so I go see what the patient wants. Its an oncology patient asking for her dilaudid, so I go grab it and start walking to her room to give it. I see Sally about to enter the room with some other meds, she says she'll just give it since she's going in there. I hand it over and sit down and wait for report. I look in the computer and she had scanned the meds and charted that they were given at 1900. She gives me report and afterwards ~1945 I hear the IV fluids in the dilaudid room dinging so i go in with a new bag. I walk in to see Sallys cow in the room, drawers wide open, dilaudid syringe sitting on patients bedside table not given yet, antibiotic IVPB sitting on counter ungiven, pt sitting there in pain saying Sally told her she would be right back 45 minutes ago. WTF. Then Sally comes in, and says ""oh I was just going to finish up in here.""  http://i.imgur.com/CRumsLk.gif

Upon further inspection, I found that 2 of the 5 patients she gave to me did not have assessments charted on the since the night before by night shift. All patients had meds given 6+ hours late, some antibiotics for surgical patients that have a specific time frame to be given. some patients had meds that were charted as given, but were still it the patients med box. One patients wife told me her husband had not been given insulin all day (it was charted that it was given), and his blood sugars were &gt;500 at both 11am and 4pm. No evidence of Md being notified (we are required to call for blood sugars over 350). She had charted that she gave him 11 units of novolog +9 units of lantus at noon and 1600, yet his 2100 blood sugar was still ~400.

Thats all I can remember right now. I wrote everything i could down, and handed it over to the hospital supervisor. I have to wait until monday to talk to my unit manager, but I have made up my mind that if Sally is not immediately fired, I will be putting my 2 weeks notice in. I do not want to work in an environment that allows people like this to have innocent people's lives in their hands. i do not want to live in fear of losing MY license because of her mistakes, and I dont want to spend my entire night cleaning up her mistakes anymore.

So there I am, trying to keep everyone alive, while my 2 yr old ""viral illness"" has a temp of 35.2, heart rate of 65, really weird mental status, falling BP... And I need to go push Ativan on Mr. Seizure and protect his airway. All the other nurses were off with their equally sick patients and it was just a mess. 

Somehow everyone made it through and shock-y kid went to ICU, seizure kid stopped misbehaving, and I charted it all. Got help from the charge nurse when she appeared. But my big worry is I still find myself feeling totally lost when this happens. We aren't supposed to have such high acuity kids on this unit but sometimes they just crash. I really didn't know what to do to prioritize so I ended up just following the ABC's and protecting the airway of the seizure patient first, but I'm worried I made a mistake and my kid in the ICU might have suffered from it.

(this is my first attempt at an edit/update. hope this is correct)

Edit: Well, in case if anyone is interested... I started capstone today. The day began with me re-introducing myself to the charge nurse (I spoke to her on the phone a few days prior). She was awesome and helpful. I explained to her that I would be on the unit for a total of 160 hours during the semester and that I would be following the same nurse for each of my ""shifts."" 

Then the nurse arrived. She had no idea that she was going to have a student for the day. She seemed quite upset. As the day went on, I realized that she probably had no idea I would be with her for another 148 hours after today. When I told her, she was furious. Fortunately, she was a great teacher throughout the day so I don't feel like I missed out on anything. Also, let it be known that I am thankful for her help. 

On the other hand, I am not going to feel comfortable when I return. She literally said, ""Please excuse me, I am going to go yell at my boss now."" I apologized and told her I really appreciated her guidance but I still felt guilty and embarrassed. (Sure, you might be thinking ""who cares if you are comfortable, you are there to learn."" Which is true, I just want to gain as much as I can from the experience without feeling like I'm this huge burden... because it is clear that I am a huge burden)

I'm a third year student nurse in the UK and have my final 3 month consolidation placement in a Care of the Elderly ward. This clinical area (but not ward) was my first placement where I learned my essential nursing skills such as personal care and observations. It will be a great placement for bringing together all of my knowledge and preparing me for the role of a newly qualified staff nurse.
What i'm a bit anxious about is caring for patients with dementia and providing them the best care that I can. I have unfortunately seen substandard care with this patient group and I do not want to conform to bad practice. Does anyone have ideas of how to communicate more effectively with this client group? Even personal experiences with families and examples of what you would not like to see a student nurse/ nurse do.
Some ideas i had was to write down things, keep a picture of them by their bedside and we have health policies, one called the Dementia Strategy and documents we can use in ward areas called This Is Me ( A hospital passport which gives us information about the person, their likes and dislikes, their worries and provides a more holistic understanding of the person).
Also any other tips for my final placement? I'll have management experience of working closely with the Charge Nurse/Ward Manager to implement ways to improve patient care, running the ward etc.

I am having such a hard time feeling compassionate and dealing with these patients. I feel like I'm not using my brain at all and like I'm passing meds, cleaning patients, putting them on and off the commode, etc. If I at least had some critical thinking to do, I'd be okay with all the physical labor. 

I certainly don't mean to dis any non-ICU specialties. I just have to admit that I've never been good with walky-talkies. I'm good with those too sick to talk, comatose or sedated, intubated patients. I admit that. 

So what can I do? I don't want to switch jobs. We are super short-staffed. I get called every day. I don't want to bring it up to the people who make the assignments because they can't help it. All our patients are crappy right now and we are short staffed to begin with, so they certainly don't need me to give them a list of the patients I can't tolerate. 

I've been really really happy at this place. I feel like this is just a short term thing going on in our unit with the type of patients we have. If it remains a problem, I'll definitely leave, but right now I'm looking for some tips on how to get through it and change my attitude. 

**TL;DR Our patients suck lately. I'm losing my compassion. How do I cope?**

**UPDATE**: Thank you everyone for the thoughtful and supportive responses. I really appreciate it. I'm taking all of your advice to heart. I think at this point, I really need to consider a change in specialty. If I have frequent vacations and a wonderful hobby that I love and I still can't stand to go to work, then I really need to consider changing specialties.  Thanks again. Will consider an update if anything changes and is worthy of an update :) ",,False,self,t5_2ra72,1345650388.0,,,True,t3_yjzyg,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/yjzyg/feeling_burned_out_and_lacking_compassion/,

I encourage everyone looking into nursing to keep your chin up and keep applying! Work as hard as you can and move up the ladder until you get a position as a CNA/LPN on the floor/at the place you want to be. You'll be more likely to get hired! Not to mention there are lots of opportunities out there through hospitals to fund your education. It's worth it to get your foot in the door first!

I don't know whether I am just sensitive to the behaviours and moods of those around me but I feel emotionally exhausted at the end of almost every single day. Both units that I work on are physically and emotionally draining but what unit isn't right? I work with people who don't want to be in hospital, have few coping mechanisms and are often (justifiably or unjustifiably) unhappy with almost everything while I am run off my feet looking after them and trying to give them the best experience possibly while remaining empathetic and understanding. But i just feel like a punching bag for so much of the day. 

I just feel like saying to my patients: I GET IT! YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE AND YOU THINK EVERYONE IS DOING A BAD JOB AND YOU KNOW BETTER EVEN THOUGH YOUR LIFESTYLE IN EVERY SINGLE WAY SAYS DIFFERENTLY AND IN SPITE OF IT ALL AND THE FACT YOU JUST TOOK OFF FOR  7 HOURS, CAME BACK HIGH AND NOW NEED 7 HOURS OF WORK CONDENSED INTO TWO LET ME RUN AROUND DOING IT WHILE YOU TRASH TALK EVERYONE. OH AND I WON'T GO TO THE BATHROOM OR GET A DINNER BREAK WHILE IM AT IT SO I CAN START YOUR THIRD IV THAT YOU'VE RIPPED OUT!!

buh. don't get me wrong- i do like my job. I like my unit and my co- workers try to be as helpful as they can, but i can only take so much aggression, passive-aggression, snide comments and insults. I KNOW that people are experiencing some of the worst, most stressful moments of their or their family member's lives and i try to remind myself that and remain calm and let things bounce off me, but sometimes by the end of the shift I just want to be rude back to people! I realize that this doesn't ever, EVER help and so i avoid stooping to that level, but i just don't know how to absorb less of the negativity if that makes sense... 

I am considering going into emerg but i am worried that that will be an even higher stress environment with people lashing out and behaving even more poorly than normal and it already bothers me so much as it is.....

sorry, this is a huge rant...but it has helped to vent... if anyone has had similar experiences/frustrations and found a way to deal with the emotions effectively I would be incredibly grateful.

When I was at peds I watched the nurses take lead on what do to for a baby in respiratory distress. The doctor was asking what they thought, and they knew what to do.

I have spent the better part of the last 20 years in various IT positions - tech support, web design, ecommerce management, marketing, etc.

In Jan 2009, my 61y unmarried, unattached, mostly healthy father (to whom I am an only child) suffered a brain stem bleed and multiple cerebellar infarcts. Amazingly, he was still in his right mind, though his voice was barely a whisper and his speech was slow and slurred. He had bilateral movement and strength, but was severely ataxic. He had also lost the ability to swallow.

Sadly, his Neurologist/healthcare team failed to immediately impress upon us the extent of the injury to his brain and how unlikely it would be for him to rehabilitate. Our only prior experience with stroke was limited to his sister who had a left parietal ischemic CVA 16y earlier; and she was living on her own with help from her daughters for groceries and anything that required driving.

Two days after he was admitted to ICU, his pulmonary function began to decline. We tried Bi-Pap, but it wasn't doing the trick. In the middle of the night, alone and afraid, I made the decision to ""save"" him when he went into respiratory arrest. Over the following days, I was hurried along the path of trach and PEG - all the while being told it would be ""more comfortable"" for him. Not once did anyone - MD, RN or even LSW - explain to me in no uncertain terms what his prognosis was. 

It was only after taking a leave of absence from my job and being bedside with him for 6 months of only mildly successful PT/OT/SLT and my own research via his medical records and Google that I realized how dire the brain damage was. At that point, I was finally able to get an MD to talk with us frankly. However, by then we had already been shuffled from ICU to LTACH to SNF/Rehab. We decided to change his code status to DNRCC and begin weening from the ventilator.

As if all that wasn't enough, his Medicare benefits had run out and I had to return to work or risk putting myself and my husband on the streets. So on top of trying to accept that he wasn't going to ""recover,"" I also had to leave him alone in a nursing home all day and sell everything he had accumulated over his lifetime at ridiculous auction prices to reduce his assets enough to qualify him for Medicaid.

Following five months of steady mental and physical decline, he passed just before Christmas 2009. 

I tried to get back to my life over the next year and a half, back to a job that I used to love. But I just could not continue dealing with the petty office politics and whiny eCommerce customers - did they not get how insignificant their ""problems"" were?

I decided I needed to do something that affected the bigger picture; something that made a significant difference in the lives of human beings. I reflected on my experience with my Dad and remembered many of the really wonderful RNs (and a few of the particularly terrible ones). And that, my fellow redditors, is where I found my inspiration to become a Nurse.

I enrolled in a 30-day STNA (Ohio) course in June 2011, did some home health care for a few months and was hired into a local hospital as a night-shift, med/surg patient care tech last November. I have to say that, so far, **I LOVE my job!** I adore my patients and I have frequent moments of inspiration from the lovely ladies (sorry, no male nurses on my unit at night right now!) that I work with.

I'm just now digging into my science pre-reqs at my local CC before I apply to an actual Nursing program. Planning on pursuing ADN -&gt; RN -&gt; BSN.

My other pt codes and doesn't make it after working on them for an hour.  
Near the end of the day, my instructor pulls me in front of the group and berates me for not giving the pt who was weaning off the vent a bath because ""EVERY pt gets a bath, everyday!""   
My co-assign asks what the hell I'm doing when I go into the room with a bed bath, I tell I have to give a bath, and she goes and gets into it with my nursing instructor.   
I'm then yelled at at post clinical for 'complaining' to the nurses on the floor about my instructor, and given a remediation.  ",,False,self,t5_2ra72,False,,,True,t3_udryj,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/udryj/whats_your_worst_nursing_school_clinical/,

Why is it that this particular task has been relegated to on the job training rather than learning it in school?

**Edit: Here in NYC of the few nursing schools I've asked, insertion of IVs is not only never taught, it is never done by a student during clinicals. It's practically ignored. I don't understand why it's OK to ignore such a fundamental skill. Seems many of you have practiced it in some way or other. Also, in the schools around here practicing *anything* except blood pressure and vitals on another student NEVER happens. Even lifting each others shirts to do abdominal exams was too much. Although, in the BSN program at my school during the physical exam class students can volunteer to allow their abdomen / breasts to be examined.**",,False,self,t5_2ra72,True,,,True,t3_sdigc,http://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/sdigc/why_dont_nursing_schools_teach_students_to_insert/,

At first, we each had 1-2 shifts per week, which is fine by me as I am also in grad school. This pattern went on until June.

When I started, our clinic manager made the schedule. One of the other RNs asked around February if she could take over that duty, and our manager OK'ed her to do that. The RN doing the schedule kept us at 1-2 shifts/week each, which continued for a few months.

In June, she cut me &amp; the other new RN to 2 shifts/month. This month, we each got 1 shift. She gave herself and the other, most senior RN, all the other shifts (amounting to 5-6 shifts per month each).

I was NOT happy about this, and I emailed her after she sent out the schedule, asking what the deal was. Her response was a) she has seniority, so she gets more shifts, and b) that's what happened to her when she was new, so ""that's how it is."" 

The other new RN &amp; I plan to speak to our manager about this tomorrow. We want to see if she's OK with this scheduling routine, or if she was unaware (which I suspect is the case). We plan to ask if the other RN can be relieved of her scheduling duties, or if she can be coached to distribute shifts more equally among all of us.

Incidentally, I am scared shitless to do this. I'm afraid of retaliation. But knowing that I am afraid to even talk about this in the first place makes me realize that I really need to do it. I am feeling bullied, and I'm worried that if I bring it up, I'm going to be further bullied.

Anyway, the **tl;dr** version is: taking issue with how another RN schedules our shifts, talking to the boss tomorrow, afraid bad shit is going to happen. Thoughts? Tips? Words of encouragement?

I am graduating in two weeks and just took my final exam of nursing school today. I am so excited to be done with this chapter of my life and move on to the next, but it is also a little bittersweet for me as I am sad to be leaving behind all the wonderful professors and nurses I've gotten to know. So, fellow May graduates (or anyone feeling a bit misty-eyed), I ask you:

1) What totally surprised you about nursing?

2) What experience had the most impact on you?

I'll start:
1) Naked people... naked people everywhere! Not ashamed of it, but before nursing school I had very limited direct patient care experiences and was a bit of a prude. The first day of clinical I was so shocked to see how not modest people were around health care professionals.  Definitely took some getting use to. 
2) So many... but right now I'll go with the new diagnosis oncology patient who cried in frustration to me and I comforted. It meant so much to me that at the end of the shift she told me what a wonderful nurse I would be- I felt like I had actually made a difference to her.

After doing all the admission things, charting my assessment, etc. I went in at 1850 to see if the family needed anything else, had any more questions, etc. (I work in peds, the patient was very young.)

The mother asked me about an antibiotic the patient had just started that week for something other than the admitting diagnosis and I said I would talk to the doctor about getting it ordered.

When I left the room, I got a call from both IV team and CT and the nurse I was giving report to was waiting for me. So despite writing down about the antibiotic, I completely forgot to both pass it along or do something about it.

I feel terrible! The parents were both crying and upset about their child's admission and I feel I might have added to their stress.

I had an otherwise great shift where I recognized a baby showing signs of withdrawal, a first for a new nurse like me, and something the previous nurse had missed. But I can't stop thinking about what I forgot to do!

Most popular questions (by repetition and upvotes) seem to be:

* Male nurses

* Differences amongst advanced practice nurses (PhD, DNP, NP, MSN, CNM, CRNA, etc...), and the 2015 requirements

* Differences amongst nurses (LPN, RN, ADN, BSN, CNA, etc...), including whether ADNs are outdated

* Different types of nursing jobs

* Can I be a nurse if....? (including anxiety, depression, DUI, tattoos, etc...)

* Snarky questions, and anything involving dealing with bodily fluids

* NCLEX prep

* How to get into nursing school, and what to do once you're in

* Job hunt and job interviews

**EDIT 2:** Alright folks, the Google Doc is up! I'm going to make a new thread asking for contributors to answer the FAQs.

I'm wondering because I've been pretty set about becoming a nurse since high-school, and I've completed all the prerequisite coursework for my bachelors and now I'm gaining experience in the Intensive Care Unit at a hospital before applying and transferring into a BSN program. I love learning about health and nursing, but I don't enjoy working in the ICU nearly as much as I thought I would. I tend to smile a lot and I'm really friendly, but I've noticed that the nurses don't seem too happy and rarely smile. 

The more I work in the ICU, the more appealing teaching becomes. I have an equal amount of passion for reading (especially classic literature) and science (disease of the human body, med terms, micro). I decided to go with nursing because I don't have the money or the time to be in med school, and nursing pays well, has job stability, and I have career opportunities abroad and all over the states. Teaching pays much less, has less job stability and opportunity, and there are less opportunities abroad and throughout the states.

I was looking to be a psych nurse. First semester: So close to passing, but I couldn't manage prioritizing. I re-took Nursing 1 and managed to pass because I focused on prioritizing. I moved on to second semester which was Med-surg and psych. I enjoyed the psych part a lot and decided I wanted to be a psych nurse instead of aiming for CRNA from there. 

Now with nursing 2, my grades have just hung around the border line (75 and above is passing). I talked to my professors about how to improve my grade, but they didn't help. I had to figure out my own mistakes. Med surg had 2 tests and psych had 2 tests and then there was the final. I realized that on med surg I focused on what the disease was, not the so much on nursing care on the second test. During the 2nd psych test, I didn't pace myself during the test and that had brought me down. Now on the final, I failed by 0.7 points. I felt like shit. Still do. I'm not out of the program. I gave a shit about clinicals unlike some of my other classmates. I didn't cheat like some of them did. I looked at the test today, I did very well on the psych portion, but got a 74.7 on the med surg. I was pissed. I got outstanding reviews on my clinical evaluations, but clinicals were either pass or fail. 

I've been at the same community college for 4 years. I've made great friends in nursing, but I haven't answered any of their texts since I still feel ashamed about failing the program. Still in shock about failing. I wanted to be a psych nurse. 90% of my friends were made through nursing. It just sucks leaving the program.
