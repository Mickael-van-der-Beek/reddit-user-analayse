Maybe there could also be a 'monster radar' type app that scans in all directions around the phone.

Perhaps include a printable QR code that when placed on the wall with make a monster show up that you can 'zap' out of the way.

I'm usually on the lookout for decent looking apps (#HOLOYOLO), so I made a list of apps that always seem to find their way on my phone. Maybe you guys might find a new app or two or even suggest better alternatives.

I like and use almost *all* of [Google's apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Google%20Inc.&amp;hl=en). It's great if you're within Google's ecosystem like me.

You can download it, but unless you have a network login for the company and permissions to get into the tools, you can't use it.  

The app has our helpdesk ticketing address as the email contact.  We never get contacted about the application, but I got an email from some guy who was saying he can post as many good reviews for the app as we're willing to pay for.  Naturally we just ignored this, the app isn't for public consumption, reviews don't matter.  A couple of weeks later I got another email from the same source as the first warning that without his services, our app could lose business.  I checked in the play store and saw that there were dozzens of one star negative reviews with comments like, ""Ruined my phone.""  I checked our ticket history related to the app to see if there were any problems like this, and the only ones we've had were for a user whose permissions on our end weren't configured right.  

I emailed the person back and told him it isn't meant for the public, it's on the app store for our convenience and it doesn't matter how many bad reviews we get, the app is fine and only meant for internal users who report no problems.  He replied that it'll be too bad if google takes down the app because of so many negative reviews and we need his services.  

I got the gist of his message, he's probably spamming negative reviews to force us to try and ""Hire him"" to counter the negative reviews.  The admins are taking it up with google, but I thought I'd share with you that on top of fake good reviews there are people spamming apps with negative reviews like mobsters who shake people down for protection money.

We created this app to figure it out for us. It uses your location (GPS or manually set) to find the price of stations in the area (similar to gasbuddy), but also factors in the gas that you spend in actually driving to the station.

A station farther down the road might have gas for $3.50 vs the one down the corner at $3.55, but it might actually not be worth it to get gas at the cheaper station. 

We would really appreciate some support and help getting us noticed!
**If you save $.25 using this app, it pays for itself in 4 uses.**

Edit: Thank you all for the responses and constructive criticism so far. We are listening to your suggestions and ready to work on creating features that you would like to see implemented in the future. We have a few plans **(big ideas)** that we are working on... not ready to disclose them right now for obvious reasons of getting them stolen.

Edit2: Here are descriptive app pictures explaining how the app works- as kushanj1 requested: [pic1](http://i.imgur.com/Mcv4iq6.png), [pic2](http://i.imgur.com/R81oCbs.png), [pic3] (http://i.imgur.com/9G7mcBB.png), [pic4] (http://i.imgur.com/XpDfBmA.jpg), [pic5] (http://i.imgur.com/p0HOtYv.jpg)

Edit3: Here is the current list of new features that have been requested so far and will be implemented in the next update. Feel free to leave a comment with anything you'd like to see.

* Inside settings page:

* Allow showing gas stations in the list even if price is N/A or last updated over a month ago. (Some people are reporting not seeing all stations in the area, this is why. We figured those stations wouldn't help you make your decision anyway so we took them out of the list)

* Add feature to calculate time taken to drive to/from station as a function of hourly pay/ (value of personal time per hour). (Is it *really* worth it to drive out of the way?)

Edit4: **One long week later** we have finally made an update with the features you all requested. It should be available to download within a few hours (whenever google play decides to update our page). Those of you who purchased the app: leave your feedback here and please rate the app on google play- it helps us get noticed and only takes a minute. 
We also released a *free* lite version of our app for those who just want something simple: [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appwizards.fuelwizlite)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ui.LapseItPro

Well basically I managed to implement something very unique in this version that will improve dramatically it's usage, now it's possible to capture your time lapse videos without the need of the app being in foreground, actually it's not even necessary that the screen is turned on ...

Yes, you can capture your time lapse videos while driving and use the ""maps navigation"" app simultaneously, you can capture time lapses in ""hidden mode"" with it either in background or with the screen completely disabled and etc ... just to give a few examples.

We also added the onion skin feature in this version so people that like to do stop-motion can see a transparency of the last frame so they can properly prepare the next shot ...

So everything is great right? Even more because I decided to just give the app for free for the weekend in this sub-reddit :)

Only thing I ask? PLEASE, test the new features, test the capture modes in your devices, in the settings go to ""background modes"" and read the differences there and let me know what and what not work and your device model.

Also test the stop motion mode and tell me if the picture is perfectly aligned with what was being previewed ( You can change to stop motion mode in the capture screen, tapping the menu button that shows how many pictures per second will be taken ).

Another thing? Can you UPVOTE this post? Yes, you are getting the app for free so it would be great if you can click the arrow if you liked it.

Also if you liked so so much the app, you can always support it's development buying it in Google Play.

I haven't heard anyone recommend Firefox mobile, only Dolphin and Chrome, which are still great, by the way.

However, it's so fluid and refreshing. It doesn't seem like a forced, uncomfortable desktop port and I love the way they organize the tabs, especially over Chrome's unwieldy rolodex-type thing. You can easily get a hold of your tabs, your private browsing tabs and your tabs which are on the desktop Firefox.

One shortcoming is full screen browsing, which I think Chrome does best. Firefox doesn't have it yet, but I have no doubt they'll include it soon.

I still have Chrome and Dolphin installed, but Firefox is the only mobile browser I have *enjoyed* using.

Round about the time Reddit was raising pitch forks against SOPA I was reading a sci-fi book (whose title and author escape me now) which had a world where all the citizens voted on laws via their implants. 

I thought it would be awesome if we had the technology to do that instead of having to rely on politicians to represent our interests. Then I realized that we did (well minus the implants of course ....). That everyone holds in their hands a device which can be used to vote on a bill before parliament.

6 months of learning Android app development later I give you CONSENSION:

I'm currently tracking bills before parliament for the following countries:

United States of America

United Kingdom

Canada

Australia

New Zealand

South Africa


I'll be adding State or provincial bills over the next couple months and hopefully getting down to local or municipal government by early next year.

It still very basic and a far cry from my final vision for what it will be but I'd love to get some feedback from Reddit before unleashing it on the world.

edit 1: The app is also currently only available in the above countries.

edit 2: *** This app is only compatible with phones or tablets with telephony hardware ***

edit 3: I've uploaded a new version of the app with several changes thanks to the feedback I have received so far. It can take a few hours to be available so if you want to wait for it keep an eye out for version 1.31 to show up.

I don't know about you all, but i tend to use my phone with one hand, while walking, or listening to music in the car, and having to loosen my grip to hit back or end is a fairly large annoyance as the buttons are at the top of the screen- plus i have to look to make sure im not hitting something on the screen vs the menu. 

I noticed recently that in poweramp, you can move the menu bar to the bottom(the button used to change equalizer and bass on the fly). As a result,  you aren't forced to ""jump"" your thumb to the top of the screen and can still securely hold on to the phone.

Users: how would people feel about moving menu bars to the bottom, closer to your thumbs reach, as opposed to the top? (hate to say it, but apple was smart in forcing their notification bar in an upward fashion. im sure this was to avoid lawsuits and i know you can change this with nova gestures, but to me this is a basic thing that should have been implemented as stock a long time ago)

Devs: How easy would it be to implement this in future updates or at least allow the option to do this? Poweramp is one of the only apps I know to allow this(i'm sure there are more I do not know about). 


Examples:

Pretty much every brower: why not put the url at the bottom so i can reach it more easily? if i wanted to sit down and search i would use a computer(extreme example but you get it, usually you're on the go if you're using your phone)

Gmail/maps: same thing, place the back/delete/archive bar at the bottom of screen(I know you can swipe, but not everyone uses this). Search bar at the bottom of maps would be clutch since 90% of the time you're in the car navigating so averting your attention to push a button is a big no-no. noticed this yesterday as i looked for a BK in my area--half the time i was pushing on the map as opposed to the search bar because I couldn't look away from the road=frustrating(I know, i shouldn't be doing this, but lets be real, we all do it from time to time)

Phone dialer: phone/recent/people menu is at the top, why can't it be at the bottom so i can easily switch between? 

Even the reddit apps could use a redesign by placing the frontpage/menu bar at the bottom. 

I know this isn't a huge issue, but these are computers and they should be tailored to our needs(especially given how far custom roms have come), not the other way around. To me, this seems more like a UI change as opposed to new coding, but I may be wrong.

My dad has been programming for a big portion of his life. For most of that time, he worked on IMB mainframes in assembly language. Just recently, he wrote a very simple android game in java. It is not original, and it is not very complicated, but he tried really hard and wrote the entire thing by himself. Even more recently, he got his first review. It was very vague, short, and most importantly, negative. He was, of course, very crushed. I was wondering if some of you guys could try out his game and give an honest and more detailed review of the game. I'm not asking for five-star ratings – you can may not like it at all. All I ask is that you try pin point the flaws, and maybe even a few of the good things. That way, he won't be left to wonder about what was wrong with the game.


Thank you in advanced!

First a quick story (you can jump to the TL;DR): No so long ago, I decided I wanted to develop games and interactive apps for different platforms. I got really lucky, and a company hired me as a freelancer to develop a software they were planning to include in a tablet for launching next August. This was at the end of the last year.

I suggested them an interactive desktop for kids (the tablet was family oriented), with a lot if interactive elements so the desktop could be like a game itself. They liked the idea and I started to work on it part time, combining it with my full time job and family.

Some weeks ago, I got fired from my job, and instead of feeling miserable (well I feel like it a little bit, but not too much: being fired never is easy) I realized how lucky I am now for being able to work full time in something I like and, hopefully, will pay the bills (for now).

So here it is, an interactive desktop for Android, that can be easily switched by changing the default desktop (just press ""exit"" and it will ask for your default launcher). I'm really excited as it is my first big app designed and made by myself. It maybe has some rough edges, so here's where I need your help, I need your feedback.

The company that hired me is called MILAN (like the Italian city), so the app is called MILAN Playground. Here is a promo video (I made it myself too! including the music!):

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFmk8_xni3Y

Here is the Play Store link: 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runawaybits.milanlauncher

The app is currently free, but sadly it will be a paid app (using an unlocker app) starting from the next update in August, with the tablet launch.

**TL;DR**: I wanted to develop games and interactive apps, a company hired me as a freelancer, I got fired from my full time job, the app is almost ready, I want you to try it.

http://www.xda-developers.com/android/swiftkey-flow-beta-available-for-free/ 

Swiftkey is the greatest thing ever for anyone with a touch screen. My god. This is literally fantastic. Even if you're not a swype fan, the predictive on this is amazing if you take the time to learn the settings. 
Did I mention it's $3.99 in the Play Store but FREE for the BETA  which is actually the SAME EXACT version WITH SWYPE?! 
Yeah, it's like that...

You'll also want to search out Quick keyboard switch app for ease of access. 

&gt;AFAIK, the beta on swiftkey has an expiration date on each build and these public betas were mainly just because of the Flow/swipe typing feature

 -- Might need to check into this, I'm a notorious cheapskate pirate. I don't have time for petty details such at this! I was too busy learning to make Gif animations lol (http://i.imgur.com/MI83D.gif -- There is no app for this, I'm using http://i.imgur.com/X0u0O.gif tutorial lol)


* Color Note

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.socialnmobile.dictapps.notepad.color.note&amp;hl=en 

Color note is this nifty little app that allows you to make note cards, check lists, and other stuff. Highly intuitive and very user friendly with no extra gizmos to bog it down. 5/5 stars no doubt. It's amazing for cross out lists (To-Do) and you can even put it on the Lock Screen to quick open to take notes on :D
+ With SwiftKey taking notes is easy as pie. I'm texting at like some absurdly high word count right now with minimal error. Aww yee brb sunglasses. (⌐■_■) aww yeee

* Elixer 2 

https://play.google.com/store/search?q=elixer2&amp;c=apps 

Elixer 2 is actually so complicated it boggles me. I don't understand why or how this is FREE. This literally is mind blowing guys. 10/10 would download again.
I've only had a smart phone for 9 days now, so that might be a factor in my 'zomg' but still.... Basically (yeah right...) this thing is a custom Wigget maker, battery monitor, wifi settings, custom settings, everything settings, super customizer on steroids on super crack! It's got so many awesome settings it'll blow your minds. It feels like I'm on a rooted device with all the options this thing gives. You can create custom icons and other such things down to a core level like battery voltage o_O. Try it. It's FREE! 


* My Boy Free

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fastemulator.gbafree&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5mYXN0ZW11bGF0b3IuZ2JhZnJlZSJd 

A very simple and FREE GBAEmulator. It doesn't come with ROMS, but you can always just Google those and put them on your Adroid. I literally was dumbfounded at the power of this nifty contraption called a ""phone"". I was like ""I wanna play pokemon"" no longer than 35 seconds after the inception of that thought and punching in ""Pokemon FireRed noGBA rom"" did I think ""hmm...I wonder if GS3 can run this?"" Sure enough, it can. So yeah... Free pokemon on a screen better than my original GBA? Yeah, no. Technology has gone too far O_O
http://i.imgur.com/n80o9.png

* SkEye

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lavadip.skeye&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5sYXZhZGlwLnNrZXllIl0.

SkEye is this pretty awesome stargazing app. Basically, you point it at the sky, and it shows you what stars you're looking at and what consolations are there. It's pretty nifty, and minimalistic. I like it :)

* Skype

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5za3lwZS5yYWlkZXIiXQ..

If you don't know exact what Skype is shame on your! SHAME! 
It's video chat / AIM / Contact Book.

* Nova Launcher 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS50ZXNsYWNvaWxzdy5sYXVuY2hlci5wcmltZSJd

This is basically a new desktop for lack of better explanation. It's very very very customizeable, and used in tandem with Elixer 2 is just fantastic. It should be noted that this app is technically free, but feels more like a trial version. My oppinon is the prime version is well worth the few bucks. 

* QuickPic

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.alensw.PicFolder&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5hbGVuc3cuUGljRm9sZGVyIl0.

QuickPic replaces ""Gallary"" 
That's really all there is to it. It's awesome. Try it. It's light weight and easy to use.


* Landscape Wallpaper

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lwp.superluminar.swallpaper&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImx3cC5zdXBlcmx1bWluYXIuc3dhbGxwYXBlciJd 

LSW is basically what it sounds like. It turns your photos (ANY OF THEM!!) into a ""scrolling"" background. Go watch the video :) it's easy enough to use, but very basic in nature. 


* Scanner Radio

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scannerradio&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5zY2FubmVycmFkaW8iXQ..

Great for Fire Fighters, and Cop Watchers alike! This widget app is fantastic (when it works). You can listen in to their radio :) 
It's perfectly legal FYI. 


* Easy Battery Saver

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easy.battery.saver&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5lYXN5LmJhdHRlcnkuc2F2ZXIiXQ..

It's exactly what it sounds like, and even shows what apps are eating your data. 

* Image Viewer 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.codein.gifviewer&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm9yZy5jb2RlaW4uZ2lmdmlld2VyIl0.

It just makes different file types easy to open, for example GIF animations will now properly render in Gallery (or QuickPic). It has other features, but personally I just got it so Gifs would work -shrug-

* CurveFlash (Brightness Level For Example)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.curvefish.widgets.brightnesslevel&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5jdXJ2ZWZpc2gud2lkZ2V0cy5icmlnaHRuZXNzbGV2ZWwiXQ..

This is basically for people who want very quick icons for their settings and don't want to learn Elixer 2 (I found Elixer after I found this as I downloaded this day 1 with the phone). They work pretty well, and I still use the brightness short cut on my unlock screen.

* PolarisViewer 

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infraware.polarisviewerupdater_D2VZW&amp;hl=en

This will properly allow you to render a ton of different file types, including but absolutely not limited to MSWORD_Files (.DOC and .DOCX) 
It's amazing how well it works considering the more popular versions seem to suck balls and bombard with adverts and kill battery and not render properly. 

* Light Manager LED (for the S3 Light Flow seems to have issues on some models) or Light Flow (for everyone else?)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koo.lightmanager&amp;hl=en

Hmm. This one baffles me. Please go watch the video, but basically it just changes the LED on the front of your phone to custom colors. I personally can't get mine working, but that's probably because my AT&amp;T phone is different than my friends -shrug- However, from what I've read the S3 has some issues with LED and unrooted phones (lol look at me sounding like I know what I'm talking about :3 I'm a newbie.)

* Llama (Location Profiles)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kebab.Llama&amp;hl=en

This smart little app seems to know where you are. Based on that information it can do stuff! What type of stuff you ask? Well, after going to bed and letting it ""scan location"" for 8 hours (which honestly you only need 5 or 6 minutes) it now knows where I live :o. As soon as I walk out of the house, the ringer is silenced (I hate ringing), the alarm clock is disabled (also when in class, although I haven't set a defined area for ""in class"" yet) encase I'm up early, and wifi is turned off. When I walk back into ""HOME"" all of that turns back on :o and Skype loads up and so does my alarm clock so I can reset it :o
It's awesome!

* The Akinator Genie (sorta not free)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.digidust.elokence.akinator.paid&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5kaWdpZHVzdC5lbG9rZW5jZS5ha2luYXRvci5wYWlkIl0.

Alright this guy is $1.99. That's too much in my opinion as it's massively entertaining for maybe 25 minutes tops. I'm cheap, what can I say. That being said, you can load this up online FREE, so you all need to check that out. What is it you ask?
Let me just tell you up front that you wont ever feel comfortable with computers again O_O
You pick a ""character"" real or fake... and it knows. IT KNOWS O_O Don't think of it as 20 questions, it's not, but it knows. IT KNOWWWWSSS O_O

* Kingsoft Office 5.3.1 (Free)

This is apparently like Power-Point, without the actual screen show maker. It seems rather legit. I haven't tested it, but as it was listed here this one seemed worth noting. It seems to make graphs and organize spread sheets and have a ton of interesting features, that someone like me probably end up just making art out of. 


____________________
That's all for now guys, I'll update this list as I find more interesting / help full stuff like ALARM CLOCK PLUS

If anyone has any other great apps feel free to post them here. As well, I'm looking for a good place to get some discounted screen protection for my naked phone so she doesn't die if dropped :D
________________
Now I personally have a Galaxy s3 (I've never even owned a smarty pants phone before 9 days ago as of 1/8/13) so I'm not really sure the deal with the rest of this...But I know for the s3 there is a preloaded widget called ""Favorite Apps"" which is great to customize your ""home screen"" with. It's like a shelf for your icons :O As well for those who don't know (I've met a few where I work) it DOES COME WITH A FLASH LIGHT called Assistive Lighting Widget. Just thought I'd let you all know. ohheycaniblogspamhereabit -shiftyeyes-

In about 5 minutes, I just set up a new profile to auto accept incoming calls while I'm in my car.  It speaks the incoming name (or number if it can't ID), waits 3 seconds, accepts the call and puts it on speakerphone. 

I also have an NFC sticker in my car that triggers a profile to turn on bluetooth and GPS, launch my music app, and start playing music.  It also puts the timeout on my phone to a minimal level so the screen isn't always on.

I have profiles that detect when I'm at home, work, or connected to a known wifi.  It then turns off GPS and mobile data, sets volume levels (ie. vibrate only at work, ringer high at home), etc.

I have a profile that detects when I've left work, and half-way home it turns on the GPS, gets my current speed, and sends an SMS to my wife to let her know I'm coming home.  The speed lets her know if I'm stuck in traffic or moving quickly.

Much like above, any incoming SMS messages can check my speed and if I'm moving faster than 15 K/H then it auto responds that I'm driving and that I'll respond when I can.

I have a menu pop up when I plug my phone in.  It has 3 options, one for car (turns on GPS, and starts navigation), one for home (turns up screen brightness, volumes, etc), and one for night (silent mode, quick screen timeout).

Anyway, that's about it.  I've seen people say that there are free apps that do most of what Tasker does (Llama for instance), but they don't.

Then it asks you to buy the pay version. The Paywall is $7. I use FoxFi and it has been useful and transparent. It works without root (tho I have root). 

The update of last weekend (Sat Nov 17) changed everything.  FoxFi now disconnects every 20 minutes and offers you a chance to buy it for $7. There --it's disconnected while I was writing this--. 

It was a surprise to find it crippled into _nagware_ and within their rights but... If I buy it will they change it again? How do I know? I bought the pro version of a recording app only to find that it wouldnt work in Canada since I couldnt connect to the internet there to pass their paranoid theft check for each use. _H8._

- I think this is my opportunity to find out about the alternatives, just to educate myself. I've had some experience of buying an app and being ""ehh"" about it afterwards. FoxFi has been excellent so far tho one reviewer reported disaster that happened only after purchasing the new model. Then it's bought forever. ^(Edit: I just found out that FoxFi Pay will not/does not support Jellybean so I would be buying a deadend program that won't work on my new Nexus. The price is for old tech use only.:( Just guessing that they will _charge again_ for a Jellybean version.)

But not a single one is finished.  everything is missing features that have been surpassed by others... hands down.

I've been using google music on my phone since it came out, I thought/still think cloud storage is great.

Google music still sucks at: 
 
*  metadata
*  tracking duplicates
*  ignoring local files
*  music selection
*  availability

Metadata/duplicates:  How hard is it to sync metadata between my local computer and the cloud?  If I rename the file, google music manager should be able to notice that and change the filename on the cloud served file.  If i edit something even easier such as metadata, google should be able to update that!  Its bullshit that I have to delete  the cloud file, and then reupload it with the correct metadata.  that or, edit the metadata twice!  its silly that they cant watch for changes.  The metadata editor on the cloud is 'ok', but i still have problems with it: it fails to update files (minutes) and it fails to edit all files if you select multiple files.  I've never had a good experience adding thumbnails, I've given up on that front.  

Ignore local files - I'm fucking tired of this mess.  I have google voice, and in order to listen to voicemails, i download the mp3.  now I have fuckton voicemails that are in google music.  I have audio lectures (about 70) that get added, and the way they are i have to remove each individual one.  Random ringtones.  Random mp3s.  Its a fucking mess!  All I want is to tell google music where my music fucking actually is, and to ignore the rest of my phone.  Say goodbye to ever getting to use shuffle when you've got hour long lectures just waiting to be played.

Using the app is sometimes annoying.  you click something and click back, instead of leaving you in the middle of the list, it starts you at the top again.  If you're on random, the playlist doesnt move to match the now playing song--it just fucking sits there.  if you accidentally click somewhere wrong, you've just selected a single song, instead of the album, and you've cleared your playlist.

thumbtack icon doesn't dissappear if you dont have data.  I fucking know I want to download music to my phone!!! when it has data! right now my phone doesnt have a connection, so let me delete the fucking notification and or have it not come back in 2 minutes!

This is just a small app I've been developing which can install the CM apps (with expanded usability) such as the Messaging app or the DSP Equilizer on any 4.1 and above ROM (May be some issue with PA, let me know) **as a system application** (Therefore, it is a root app that writes to your system directory)

I've only tested it on my nexus 4, but it should work on any device.

Installation routine is pretty simple; open it, hit install, do the same with any others, then reboot your device.

[Check out the XDA Thread on it here](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=44309947#post44309947)

Feedback is greatly appreciated :)

The usual bs: I don't take any responsibility for breaking phones, breaking ROM's, any damage to your device especially spontaneous combustion. There is a section labeled ""code"" in the thread, so all code used to write to the system directory is explained and justified, non of it is malicious.

The idea behind this, any ROM (Especially stock) that i've used i find myself missing the apps that CM comes with, so this should make the process a lot easier.


**Edit:** I'm gonna release version 2.0 at some point either late tomorrow or Thursday, the problem is this current version is just spaghetti code, its pretty messy. I've planned it, I'll build try and build it asap, tomorrow or Thursday.

**Edit:** Version 2.0.1 is up (2.0.0 crashed everything, in typical android style).

**Edit:** Version 3.0.1 is in the works

I put this on XDA, but i'll put it here as well

Managed to get server stuff working (apart from one massive problem, but I think it's my ROM that's causing it), and it'll be put on the play store when I get enough money ",,False,self,t5_2reen,1376651756.0,,,True,t3_1jsyyu,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/1jsyyu/cm_app_downloader/,

[Screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/PzDfF#9mbhO)

The main features:

* Browse any subreddit
* Swipe between images to go backwards or forwards (new images are loaded automatically)
* Ads can be disabled.
* Toggle Nsfw images on/off
* Supports decoding Imgur URLs and albums
* Sort by age and category (Hot, Top - All Time, etc)
* View a post summary with title, upvotes, subreddit, comments, submitter
* Pinch-to-zoom on any image
* View animated Gifs
* Share posts with other apps
* View the full post on the Reddit Mobile site (or open it in another Reddit mobile app)
* Images are cached to avoid repeated downloads, available cache size will vary by device.

I am trying something new with this app i'm calling ""RateWare"".  Ads can be disabled at any time via the settings menu, in exchange for disabling ads I ask that users rate the app in the Google Play Store.  It works on the honor system, you don't have to e-mail me for a key, all I'm really looking for here is more ratings and more reviews - whether they be positive or negative.

I tried to find other examples of RateWare on the market, but I was unsuccessful, if anyone has encountered other examples I'd love to hear of them.

I'm releasing the free version with the features above, and later a Pro version that includes additional features like:

* Logging in
* Loading subscribed reddits
* Upvoting and downvoting posts
* Saving posts
* Saving images

It will be a bit of a hybrid between freemium and ad supported apps.

1359397353.0,34,self.androidapps,17fvq1,DZero - An app that uses NFC for something different,NAMOS,48,14,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/17fvq1/dzero_an_app_that_uses_nfc_for_something_different/,"Hi /r/androidapps,

I was hoping to get some feedback about an app I've been working on that uses NFC tags to create conversations allowing people to share comments, pictures, links and eventually much more but only with the other people that have been physically close enough to the object in question.

Despite a small amount of downloads there's already a DZero tag somewhere in London to which someone posts pictures of paintings, a club of some description where people leave messages for each other and some Ingress players in Canada have been leaving DZero NFC tags to trade lighthearted taunts whenever the other side seizes a portal.

A single topic e.g. ""Ingress players in New York"" *could* be written to hundreds of tags meaning that each tag at each portal would launch players into the same conversation or to just the one, it depends on your use case.

Other ideas I anticipate people using the app for are;

* [Dead Drops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_drop) - Could be interesting?
* Tables in a bar / restaurant - leave reviews / recommendations or chat with other people in the bar anonymously 
* Indie brewers / cooks etc - Add a DZero sticker to bottles of beer / beer pumps and get feedback from people who've actually had a bottle
* As information points - Imagine if next to the price on a shelf there was a DZero NFC tag allowing you to read what other people have said about the product

Anyhow, the app is free to download and doesn't have ads so if you have an NFC capable phone and some NFC stickers to hand then try giving the app a whirl.

1361737705.0,37,self.androidapps,195cm2,Nomination for worst mobile apps - Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC),TomEnom,45,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/195cm2/nomination_for_worst_mobile_apps_canadian/,"**Summary**: The CBC News app is the main Android application for Canada's best known media organization.  It is advertised on multiple media, has been updated 5 times over 2 years, and has been downloaded between 100-500K times.  Yet it has a rating of 2.3 (on a 1-5 scale), has only recently got to the point where it doesn't crash at start for most users, and provokes frustration, anger, and embarrassment for those users who are able to run it.

**Detail**: The CBC has four mobile apps available [here](
https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=CBC+Mobile).
For non-Canadians who aren't familiar with the CBC, it is more comparable to the BBC then PBS.  The CBC was the 6th ""most influential brand"" in Canada in 2012 (see [here](
http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=5983)).

The News app, with a rating of 2.3, is the most prominent and by far the most popular.  It is two years old this week, and has been download between 100K-500K times in spite of the fact that its rating would ensure that it is at the bottom of all search results, and would stop most users from trying it.

The app took a long time to get past the point where it would immediately crash on common Android devices.  But once they managed to get it so that you could get to the first screen, things didn't get much better.  In short, these apps pushed the boundaries of bad in all categories, including functionality, design, and stability.

The reviews make for painful reading - an account of frustration, embarrassment and shock.  [Here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.cbc.mobile.android.cbcnewsandroidwebview&amp;reviewId=bGc6QU9xcFRPSEFIazQyNlpjbzBtcDNkY1JUQWpMejBiX2NxRWE3U2d1LW9nR2h3SkNvWnFIUzAzS3FIbFlHUlpPTVpCZ1AxS3EtN19ybmg3X28xbWhHMlE) is a review of the latest version that reminded me of an important point: ""Not fixed still for latest version. Useless app. Is there no lower rating than 1 star possible? Crashes instantly upon startup. Unbelievable. Can't you steal or borrow someone else's great news app, as there are loads out there? And stop keeping on advertising it on the radio until it actually works.""

Yes, the CBC is spending real money promoting this app across multiple media, and have been for a long time.   It has been strange to hear these ads knowing that for most users the app will simply crash.

So, I would like to nominate the CBC Android apps for a prize as worst mobile apps.  Is there actually an award for worst mobile apps?  I'm not aware of one.  Perhaps reddit could do something?

The only vector on which they might lose in their bid for the worst app award, is that the app has actually gotten better over time.  I suppose that an app that got worse with each version could challenge the CBC for the worst app award.",,False,self,t5_2reen,False,,,True,t3_195cm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/195cm2/nomination_for_worst_mobile_apps_canadian/,

I was wondering if anyone would be interested in testing out my first app.

Last month both my grandpas turned 90 and I wanted to see if I could help them get online by buying them tablets (Asus Fonepads.) It's a pretty big problem in our family that most of my relatives live quite far away from the grandparents, so we really need to find ways to stay in touch online.

I couldn't really find a launcher / user interface that would suit their needs specifically on a tablet, so I built one myself together with help from my friend.

We've made the icons super big and easy to read and actually the layout changes depending on whether you hold the device in landscape or portrait mode. 

We'd actually like to develop the app a bit further, and we could really use more feedback from other people and their Older relatives.

The Launcher is totally free to download at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.proto.ui

**Here is a quote about DolmusDriver from IGN**

“The nation of Turkey has its own kind of taxi cabs called “dolmus,” which will only leave from where they’re parked when enough seats inside have been filled by passengers. Dolmus Driver HD, then, is kind of like Sega’s Crazy Taxi – only with a whole lot more virtual people crammed into the backseat as you thread your way through traffic at unsafe speeds.” - July 19 Game Debuts, IGN

The school has some great technology to help her read, but it is in a separate room from her classroom (available to all students that need it, which is good) and for short quizzes or assignments it isn't really practical for her to leave the class.

Me and my wife have been looking for a solution for this and I think I have found something that works most of the time.

I installed Scanthing from the Google Play store. This lets you use your phone's camera to scan typed text (such as a question on a quiz) and send the photo to Scanthing's servers to OCR it. Scanthing then sends this back to your phone as text. I can share this with Talk - Text To Voice. This app came installed on my phone, but can loaded from the Google Play Store. Finally, I installed SVOX Classic Text to Speech Engine, and the SVOX US English Grace Voice and set these up as the default Text to Voice apps for Talk.

Now, I can have my daughter take a picture of the question with the Scanthing app. Crop the photo to just the part she wants with a few finger swipes. Send it for OCR conversion (requires Wifi or 3G). Share it with Talk, and listen to the question. The entire operation takes about 1 min for short text and is about 90% error free.

List of Apps needed:

Scanthing

Talk - Text to Voice

SVOX Classic Text to Speech Engine

SVOX US English Grace Voice (or any other voice you wish)

I work in a hotel, we aren't supposed to have our ringers on. But sometimes it's the only way for my boss to get in touch with me, so I'd like to be able to get his calls and texts, and those from others on my team.

What you need:

- [""Tasker""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en)

- [""Wol Wake on Lan Wan""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benfinnigan.wol&amp;hl=en)

- [""NFC Task Launcher""](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher&amp;hl=en)

- Some programmable NFC tags

- The ability to have your PC 'Wake up on LAN'



The general principle here, is to have your phone send packets to your PC when you perform an action (in my case, by swiping an NFC tag just inside my apartment door), which the computer takes as an indication to power up.

- Step 1: Turn on Wake up on LAN via the BIOS (or UEFI) on your motherboard. I'm not going to go into detail on this step, as it will vary from board to board, however it should be relatively simple to turn on.


- Step 2: Find your MAC and IP address for the PC you want to start. In windows 7 this is easily done by opening the Network and Sharing center, clicking on the blue 'Local Area Connection' button in your active network, or equivalent if you're using wireless. From there choose 'Details', then pick out the 'IPv4 address' and 'Physical Address'.


- Step 3: In the WoL app, create a new event, name it whatever you like, then add your MAC address and IP address into the appropriate fields. For me, the port field wasn't important (I left it as 9), and I left the rest of the fields as default. Press save and go back to the main screen for the WoL app. At this point you may want to press on the event you just created to test whether the packets you're sending actually wake your PC.


- Step 4: Open tasker and go to the Tasks tab. Create a new task and name it something like 'Wake PC'. Add a new action to this task, and select 'Plugin', and then choose the WoL app. On the settings screen which appears, click 'Edit' and choose the appropriate event you just created in step 3.


- Step 5: At this point, you can choose to create some action to perform, to send the packets to your PC. I chose to use NFC tags, however you could easily use tasker to trigger the event using any criteria you wish! To use the NFC tags, I wrote a new tag via the NFC task launcher app. From the main page, click the + to create a new tag, then select 'New Task' from the tag type choice. Name the tag, then Add the 'Tasker' Action from the list (tick the box and click next). Click the magnifying glass and select the task you created in step 4. From there just follow the on screen steps to write your tag, and you're done!

I write this from the fortunate position of having everything work almost first time when following the above steps.

Today I finished my first - at least a bit useful - app called ""Copy&amp;Paste"" (I did few before, but nothing serious).

Copy&amp;Paste allows you to write down your frequently used phrases such as email address, web address, phone number etc. and easily copy them into clipboard. You can then paste them everywhere you want. It´s that simple :)

You can remove items from the list by long-pressing them. App on its start creates a notification, so you can access it easily even when you are working with other apps.

Few things coming soon, such as settings (option of turning notifications on/off, starting app on start-up etc.) :)

Please feel free to download my app and give me some feedback. Thank you :)

I like the idea of Fitocracy, but it only has one view point and I am using a TF300T with the keyboard always attached.

I can deal with the one option in view, but this is the following I'm looking for in a fitness app:

* lists the exercises and tells you how to complete them
* Allows you to set-up your own routines from various activities
* Possibly have activities/badges/rewards/etc. to encourage me to work out (as I don't like asking friends to use these apps, and don't seek friends on these apps usually)
* Possibly free to at least try out. (If I really like an app I will buy it, but I go through many apps until I find the one I like.) 

What I don't care for:

* calorie Counter
* a running one (I don't run, and won't get into until the weather is warmer, and the snow is gone. 


Other fitness apps I want to find are:

* Yoga ones (okay this is basically the only other one I want.); an app that goes through the steps of yoga, is good for beginners. 

**Background/ Conclusion:**

I used to use Wii Fit (and EA Active) for my exercises, but my balance board died officially (claims I'm standing on it when I am not even near it.) So I have a little fitness experience, but not much. Therefore it is time to find an app that is suitable for a beginner, who kind of knows some moves, but needs help tracking routines, and learning new exercises. 

**Update on What's been tried**

* Bodbot - I like this app so far, and to those wanting to try it, I recommend setting up the online site  account first to be able to select the equipment you have available for use, and other more customizable sections.
* Jefit - Not a bad app, but personally not a fan of it. Had lots of exercises, but it felt like so many of them require gym equipment, and I have not broken my comfort zone to go to a gym yet. (Maybe one of these days though)
* Runtastic - Looks great for those who have a phone and can get outside for a run. Right now these type of apps are no good to me, so I skipped testing the rest.

I'm calling it ClearMeOut and it's just gone [live on the Play Store here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.indivisible.clearmeout).

I'm not expecting this to be anything amazing but since the OP never responded to my PM I figured I'd at least share it here for anyone else who might get some use out of it.

Keep in mind that it's still in development and isn't polished in any way.

[Weather Alerts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.katzmatt.dashclock.weatheralerts) is a DashClock extension that displays the current National Weather Service alert status for your current (or a set) location. The extension requires Android 4.2, and the [DashClock Widget](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.nurik.roman.dashclock&amp;amp;hl=en).

Here are some screenshots, to get an idea of what it looks like: http://imgur.com/a/8zuJU

The latest updates contain options to use the full or mobile version of the national weather service website, as well as better filtering for non-alerts, like weather outlooks and short term forecasts.

You can **[purchase the extension in the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.katzmatt.dashclock.weatheralerts)**, or (if you just want to try it / don't think a DashClock extension should cost money) you can [download the APK here](http://katzmatt.com/android/weatheralerts/).

I'm still new to Android development, and this is my first app, so if you have any feedback please let me know. I've quickly made changes to the app at the request of several different users, and will keep doing so whenever possible. Keep in mind that I want the extension to remain minimal, just like DashClock, and that I'm already looking into adding support for other countries.

If you're more visual, here's a video I recorded: https://www.dropbox.com/s/f6jrkwo09fr2zgw/HardRock.mov The first minute shows the app, the last three minutes is a very cool demo. I'll be sitting here all day answering questions and taking suggestions. Ask me anything and I'll respond immediately.  

Breadcrumbs is an app that allows you to see what's happening at all your favorite places - all in one dashboard. Instead of going to a business' Facebook page or a Twitter page or relying on your newsfeed to show you info you want to see, simply ""Remember"" a business and you can manage all of that information in one place.  

http://breadcrumbs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/phone-places-list.png  

What's cool is that a business doesn't have to participate in our program for us to provide useful information about them. We match Foursquare locations with social media pages (currently only support Facebook) and so Breadcrumbs works for a business whether it's located in San Francisco, San Diego, or Cedar Rapids.  

The coolest part is when a business is participating in our program. If you're tracking a business and you're in the area when they've got something going on, you'll get a notification encouraging you to drop by. Since you only receive notifications from places you choose to ""Remember"", there's no need to worry about spam.

I feel like I finally started utilizing my gadgets to their full potential (relative to an average user who doesn't code or do any programming) and I want to go meta with this and share with you lovely people my app list.

**Samsung Note II**


[**Feedly**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.devhd.feedly&amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5kZXZoZC5mZWVkbHkiXQ..) I use this for RSS feeds to blogs and sites I like to follow replacing Google Reader.

[**Currents**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.currents&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLmN1cnJlbnRzIl0.) Google's beautifully done app.  It contains a huge selection of news sources for a variety of categories and countries.  I find myself keeping up with Slate, Vice, The Independent, Smithsonian, Forbes and many other online magazines over at Currents.

[**Flipboard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flipboard.app&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImZsaXBib2FyZC5hcHAiXQ..) Again a very smooth and beautiful UI that could overlap with Currents in relation to content but still has a selection of sources that Google Currents doesn't have (and vice versa).  

[**News Republic**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mobilesrepublic.appy&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5tb2JpbGVzcmVwdWJsaWMuYXBweSJd) For more direct news on current affairs rather than analysis and reports, News Republic (especially with their more recent update) is very prompt and aggregates news from different sites (you can also exclude sources you don't trust) depending on your chosen category (similar to the way Google News works).

[**Springpad**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.springpad&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5zcHJpbmdwYWQiXQ..) Not so much a news aggregator (although it can be used as such if you follow people's 'notebooks' on Springpad - but I choose not to use it that way) I use it to save webpages or contents that I would like to keep for future use.  So for example if I found an interesting cheesecake recipe somewhere, I would save the link in my food recipes notebook.  If you install the [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/springpad-clipper/eclcnlepmfepnccogfjdafhhlgcfdmnj?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) and [Chrome app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/springpad/fkmopoamfjnmppabeaphohombnjcjgla?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) on your PC you can always have quick access to your notebooks.

[**Pocket**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5pZGVhc2hvd2VyLnJlYWRpdGxhdGVyLnBybyJd) This app (and Chrome [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocket-formerly-read-it-l/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) and [app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pocket/jijgclgmgjipgefcnnnibgllfonlfdap?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) ) allows you to save articles for future offline reading.  As there is no data connection in the London Underground, I find myself opening pocket on my device to read one of the many articles I stumbled upon while surfing the net on my PC and didn't have the time to read them then.

I use the above apps in conjunction with [**reddit sync**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laurencedawson.reddit_sync.pro&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5sYXVyZW5jZWRhd3Nvbi5yZWRkaXRfc3luYy5wcm8iXQ..), [**StumbleUpon**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stumbleupon.android.app&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5zdHVtYmxldXBvbi5hbmRyb2lkLmFwcCJd), [**Pinterest**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pinterest&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5waW50ZXJlc3QiXQ..) (I used to have a folder full of cool photos and images that I wanted to save until I discovered Pinterest and uploaded everything into neat categorized boards and started following other people with similar interests - a very nice social network based on images), [**Google+**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.plus&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5nb29nbGUuYW5kcm9pZC5hcHBzLnBsdXMiXQ..) (having interesting people and pages in your circles always provided me with relevant content in my newsfeed, but their recent Communities section just opened up a whole new life in this amazing social network) and [**Facebook**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5mYWNlYm9vay5rYXRhbmEiXQ..), [**LinkedIn**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.linkedin.android&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5saW5rZWRpbi5hbmRyb2lkIl0.) and Twitter ( [**Falcon Pro**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jv.falcon.pro&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5qdi5mYWxjb24ucHJvIl0.) ).  Just to do my part in spreading relevant content, I found it very simple to share with any of these apps on my mobile device but on my PC it was a hassle until I started using [this Chrome extension.](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/addthis-share-bookmark-ne/cgbogdmdefihhljhfeiklfiedefalcde?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)

**Asus TF201 tablet**


In my tablet I have the exact same app list I use on my phone (except for Facebook I use [**Friendcaster**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.senab.blueNotifyFree&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInVrLmNvLnNlbmFiLmJsdWVOb3RpZnlGcmVlIl0.) since the official app doesn't support landscape tablet view) plus the following apps.

[**BBC News**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bbc.mobile.news.uk&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImJiYy5tb2JpbGUubmV3cy51ayJd) I'm in the UK so for more local news I would check this app which is surprisingly really well done.

[**Economist**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.economist&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInVrLmNvLmVjb25vbWlzdCJd) Without paid subscription you can't read everything, but you are allowed to read their weekly editorials for free.

[**Financial Times**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ft.news&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5mdC5uZXdzIl0.) Again you need paid subscription to view all the content, but they do allow reading 10 articles free every month.  What's nice about the app is that it automatically makes all content available for offline reading everytime you access it.

You can imagine with all these apps you simply have so much content to go through it's absolutely incredible!  It's truly a beautiful age of information we live in ladies and gentlemen and I feel with such systems there is absolutely no excuse for people not to be intouch with the world around them.

I had just about managed to do it before with Tasker, but it was a bit messy. Today I found this app:

I need an app like the default gallery on my old phone [(Nokia N8)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WouHlGccaQ&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL1188E2047787D3A3&amp;feature=results_video). It just showed all image and video files in a grid/list (excluding album art, and system files) arranged by the date they were shot or added to the phone. It was so much easier and straightforward. And sorting was done by tags. If I had 500 photos in a grid I could just select ""donwload"" tag and see only those that I've downloaded from the browser. Tags were presented in a handy [word cloud](http://images.dailykos.com/images/user/14898/biden_word_cloud_large2.jpg). It did most of the things automatically but offered personalizing in just a few clicks.

I downloaded many gallery apps (F-Stop Media Gallery, PicsArt Viewer, Gallery ICS, QuickPic, ) and still nothing comes even close. I really don't understand why there are so many gallery apps and they all look and work the same way. There's literally absolutely no differentiation whatsoever.

So here is the list:

**Anti 2.0** - primarily hacks old windows computers  , has port scanner and network scanner

**Piik** - sniffs images on the network 

[**Applent market**](http://applanet.net/) - ""never pay for a single android app again"" - this. is their moto - however , their server is currently down , and i did not test it (this app was removed from the android market). ""full of dodgy malware thanks to the Chinese users putting them there"" according to icky_boo .

[**Aptoide**](http://aptoide.com/cli_install.html) - this is the real deal , install with **[Aptoide repos](https://market.android.com/details?id=es.paraisoft.android.aptoiderepos&amp;hl=en)** (to add repositories) - it searches apps on user created repos - 1 word - awesome - every deleted app from the market is there

[**Droidsheep**](http://droidsheep.de/?page_id=23) - arp poisons your wifi router - hijacks fb and whatever else sessions , can email u the cookies - works like charm

[**FaceNiff**](http://faceniff.ponury.net/) - supposed to be like droidsheep , but i found it less effective

[**Hack A Droid**](http://getandroidstuff.com/hack-droid-android-download-app-v42/) - kinda like anti : port scanner , banner grabber , host scanner , and a not-working router cracker

[**WeirdVoice**](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.weirdvoice&amp;feature=apps_topselling_free) - spoofs call and voice (deleted from market) - first few calls free , then charges some minimal fee for every call - awesome program - works . thou the spoofed voice is kinda lame . these voice spoofing are rare guess , i didn't find any others that work outside us.

[**WiFiKill**](http://dj69.bazaarandroid.com/app/net.ponury.wifikill/16/61897) - disconnects computers from your wireless network - i tried it on my laptop - didn't work - but people on the inter say it works

**Better Termianl** - you must have a shell , i use it for pinging , ssh , and dns resolve testing

**Penetrate Pro** / [**Wireless Cracker**](http://apps.bazaarandroid.com/app/com.firebird.wirelesscracker/18/46112) - supposed to crack wifi , they have like green light for wifis they can crack , nothing from where i sit , air-crack is defiantly better

[**WiFiFoFum**](http://www.appbrain.com/app/wififofum-wifi-scanner/com.dynamicallyloaded.wififofum) / [**Wifi Analyzer**](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.farproc.wifi.analyzer&amp;hl=en) - shows info about wifi networks around you

[**Router Brute Force**](http://m.bazaarandroid.com/appview.php?appid=49312&amp;pkg=evz.android.router_brute_force_ads&amp;vers=1.2&amp;app=Router%20Brute%20Force%20ADS) - they say it works , well not my router

[**Network Discovery**](http://www.appbrain.com/app/network-discovery/info.lamatricexiste.network) - nmap / network scanner for ur android (anti is also supposed to do this - but this is the best network scanner i tested so far)

i was surprised not to find any imei changing apps :(

All I really need is the recording, but it would be a bonus if it could have GPS tracking, speedo etc.

It has some features I haven't seen in other apps before, which is why I made it.

I'm looking for some help determining some of the custom settings that are available for various device models.

Some of the features are

 - Configurable Menus.
 - Multiple Interface Options.
 - Real time crop with secondary live preview screen.
 - Adjustable Focus and Light Metering areas.
 - Configurable Environment setting options to load multiple options at once. Change the entire interface or just change two camera parameters at once.
 - Full In App help.
 - Last but not least, access to custom, hardware specific camera settings and features that are limited or cannot be used in standard camera applications. 

This last the one is the one I'm looking for some help with. For those who want to try out the free version I'd really like to know what non standard features you found in your camera, and obviously the device model/version.

Any problems I'd really like to know about ASAP. This is version 1.0 so there are probably going to be a few issues with some devices.

This app is for relatively later model Android 4.0 and up devices. It can be a little processor and memory hungry because of the nature of some of the options, so if you have an older or slower device it's probably not for you.

Thanks for reading. I'll reply to any questions as soon as I can. I'm located in Aus so keep that in mind if I don't answer a question for a while.

I heard about this app, I think about a year ago? I got it because it was free, small, and looked neat. I have no artistic skill whatsoever, and I rarely use it. If I want to ""pass a note"", as it were, I'll use this to write it on the screen, and show somebody. Good for if somebody can't hear you, or hand signs just don't cut it. ;)

But I really found a niche for Markers at a kids' birthday party last year. For some reason, kids really like me. Probably because I never tell them to scram when they approach me, and I'm really tall, and I treat them with the same respect I treat adults (e.g. if they talk, I listen). And of course when the smartphone comes out, they all think it's a toy and want to play a game on it. I only have boring adult puzzle games like Shortyz, so I ""made"" a game.

Here's what I do: I let the kid take a picture of something, or I take a picture of them (rear camera is 8MP, front is only 1.3 on my device) and then I share it to Markers, and I let them draw whatever they want on it. I will then email the drawing to the parents. They can use it as a tablet/PC wallpaper, print it out, whatever, it's up to them. Of course they probably get a print, because I tell the kid that's one thing they can do with their drawing.

People put their kids' artwork on their fridge, and pictures of their kids on the fridge. So why not a cross between the two?",,False,self,t5_2reen,False,,,True,t3_18f0dz,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/18f0dz/ysk_about_markers_free_drawing_program_by_an/,

I've currently tried FreeCiv, which is in a beta. I wouldn't call it playable, because the GUI is a buggy trainwreck, and doesn't explain anything like the original Civ2 does.

I also gave that original version a try - well, the PlayStation version, using FPse. Severe graphical glitches, and the PSx controls are a bit awkward.

I also briefly tried the original Civ using dosbox, but keys and stuff didn't work like I'd expect, not even with a physical keyboard connected. The unmarked extra keys are much too cumbersome.

I'm hoping there might be some lesser known projects around that are playable. My device is an Iconia A200 tablet. Not a supercomputer, but is fairly decent. 1GHz dual core. ",,False,self,t5_2reen,False,,,True,t3_w8p2o,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/w8p2o/civilizationlike_games/,

Introducing Send2Phone!,aecker22,34,12,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/q9y5s/ever_wanted_to_send_a_file_straight_to_your/,"Website: [Eckstreme.net](http://eckstreme.net) Market link: [Send2Phone](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.eckstreme.android.send2phone)

I've been working on this for the past couple of weeks and I felt it's finally ready for release! I'm mainly looking for bugs and requests, let me know how it works for you!

Basically it lets you easily send files from your PC to your Android device. You have to install the app on both your Windows PC and also your Android phone/tablet. Once installed, just login and it will add a context menu when you right click on a file that will allow you to send that file to your android device.

If you are behind a router, you might need to forward the correct port (default 8888), or you can change the port at [change port](http://eckstreme.net/s2p_change_port.html).

I already know about some other file transfer apps that could essentially do the same thing such as dropbox, but I just wanted an easy and simple way to send files quickly. Overall, I'm pretty pleased with the result.

Anyways, I know it's not very feature filled and doesn't have too many options, but I just wanted to get the framework of the app down first. I'm working on adding a lot more features like customizing the folder to save files in, multiple file sending, no need for port forwarding, eliminating the file size limit (~20MB, haven't tested much), and much more.

This is my 2nd app on the market (first real one). It's a lock screen app, which allows you to check weather, change music, see missed text messages, control music, and more without leaving your lockscreen.

Making the app was a great experience, as I am not a programmer (hardly a graphic designer in fact), and placed an ad on Reddit about getting coding for my design. I was contacted by and went with a great company Studio Symposium. We ended up doing a revenue share with reduced cost to program the app. It was a very interesting experience and I would be happy to answer any questions.

Please email info@whitegorillamediainc.com or post here if you encounter any bugs or have any suggestions. There are a few known issues with the notification bar on some models and with album art, which we are working through.

Thanks for your support!! Looking forward to hearing what you guys think!

EDIT: The awesome crew at Studio Symposium took care of the notification bar issue, and we are releasing the update to the app right now.

I'm taking it out of beta now, as it has almost all features for day-to-day redditing. For the moment, the app is completely free. I might decide to make a paid version is it proves the app is of value in the future.

I'm wanting to know what features YOU want in your reddit client. I use this app every day now, and I want to craft the best reddit experience there is.

Here is the current feature list:
- Discover!: Find subreddits by finding subreddits related to a given subreddit. For example if you are in android, Discover! will recommend androiddev, androidapps, nexus7 etc. I'm constantly working to improve the database and recommendation system.

* Upvote/downvote
* Reply to messages and comments
* Share posts: Using the standard android share system, you can share a post to facebook, text message, gmail, twitter etc.
* Inbox
* Horizontal swiping between subscribed subreddits
* Swipe to hide posts
* Filter posts by author: Removes all posts in a given subreddit by a single author
* Filter posts by domain: Removes all posts in a given subreddit from a specific domain
* Filter posts by subreddit: Removes all posts that were originally from another subreddit. For example if you are in All, you can filter out specific subreddits.
* Filter NSFW posts: Option to hide posts that are nsfw
* NSFW Thumbnails: Option to hide thumbnails on nsfw posts
* Filter posts by score: Only show posts that have a score greater than a given number.
* In built web browser
* Browser options such as viewing the desktop version of sites.
* Block browser pops from the inbuilt web browser

EDIT:

* Now supports author's flair text in comments
* Fixed the nexus 7 bug identified by /u/dragid10
* Beta testing new features: Multi Account &amp; Subscribed Subreddits Syncing &amp; Management

It's Daniel Duley - better known as Mosfet, one of the original KDE developers. Well after a long absence from any type of coding I decided to take Android/Java for a spin. Since the result seems pretty stable I figured I'd release it as a beta and let people try it out.

It's a newsreader, you can read about it in the description. On a technical level it's made out of fragments for the site list iconview, rss parser listview, webview, and a video podcast player I couldn't get working right yet (MP4s...) The fragments are in a ViewPager so you can swipe back and forth, and there is a HorizontalScrollView for different feeds on the same site. It's basically a news app I made for myself but I think some other people might like it as well.

You can download it at: 
http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mosfet.test.htmltest

Edit: I've gone ahead and unpublished the app because of the problems with high dpi displays. It's giving people a bad impression. If the reddit community is willing to help I'd love for some of the people who had problems to email me. If I can get some screenshots of the errors and possibly send you some apks to try that would be wonderful. My email is mosfetdev@gmail.com.

The problem is I looked at my code and it seems to be correct. I figured we had a font size issue but everything is using scaled pixels like they are supposed to. Running it in the emulator also seems okay. So I really need someone with one of these high resolution devices, (ie: Nexus), who is willing to lend a hand. I'll of course give you credit in the app about dialog if your willing to help.

I've tried to make it simple &amp; aesthetically pleasing. I hope to publish it on the market and possibly put it up for 99c, but I'd like you guys to try it out and give me some feedback first..

Also if you can come up with a better name that would be great.

At the moment it does most things fairly well - but you can't create playlists and there is no enqueue function, which I think is highly sought after.


Thanks!


Another Music Player
[Link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player)


EDIT-

I've published the app now (free), so you guys can check it out on Google Play.. Probably more trusty that way.

Keep bringing the suggestions, I'm likely to act on most of them, I want it to be the best one out there! 

Disclaimer: I may not be capable of delivering the best music playing app ever. (I'm a civil engineer) 


Link updated ^^

But here's another.. 


[Play Store Link (Free)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=another.music.player)


EDIT 2 -  Maybe I'll keep the name..?

EDIT 3 - Just confirmed not working on HTC Desire HD.. I tested it on someones phone at work. I'll fix this ASAP.

EDIT 4 - So it's crashing on a certain screen size, it's not the just the HTC Desire, but I've fixed it. Not sure if I'll update it yet or wait til I've added a couple more features, so that updating isn't too frequent..

EDIT 5 - Fixed the crashing, and made some other improvements. Gonna try and fix most of the stuff talked about here.. But I've also gotta try not to put out updates to often or it will get annoying for you guys!


By the way.. Tell your friends too!!

EDIT 6:

So I've compiled a bit of a list, based on your feedback:

To do list (in no particular order)

1. Fix album art stretched on larger screens (vertically).

2. Add enqueue feature

3. Editable/renamable/creatable playlists

4. Make google play playlists compatible

5. Fix notification controls for all versions (none in API 2.x)

6. Check out lockscreen controls and see which versions support them

7. MP3 tag editing

8. Album art downloading

9. More persistent caching for images

10. Fix the now playing/widget bitmaps from going to default whenever service is dead

11. Check gapless and ensure it's working properly

12. Fix bug where service pauses momentarily when screen is unlocked, after it has been runnning for a bit

13. Add a stop button &amp; cancel notification button where possible

14. Add landscape Mode

15. Support tablet screens

16. Add File/folder browsing

17. Put the widget text above the controls rather than below.

18. Sort out force close when scrolling in album list (occured on 2.3.7)

19. ""Genius"" type automatically generated playlists

20. Recently added list

21. Sort artists by Artist Album (or add category)

22. Add genres category

23. Check fit on Xperia mini pro &amp; simlar screen sizes (seekBar out of view)

24. Add a 4 x 2 widget &amp; include shuffle &amp; repeat

25. Notification/lockscreen controls on droid x (and similar phones/apis)

26. Change the viewpager tab strip to a ""less distracting"" colour

27. Improve the icon?

28. Media volume control throughout the app

29. Make sure lockscreen controls are removed once service is dead.

This is my first 'real app'.  I started programming over this Spring Break weekend.  It allows you to set alarms based on the best time to wake up (based on average sleep cycles).  It also allows you to judge when the best time to head to sleep is based on 90minute REM cycles.

Background:
I'm a senior bioinformatics student who sleeps on demand.  My week consists of 20 school hours, 30 study hours, 15 work hours, 5 hours with my professors, and any spare time with my wife and son.

I want to sleep 12-14 hours a day.  I'm almost impossible to get up.  I started using [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me) around a month ago.  It thoroughly improved my sleep habits and feeling during the day.  I wanted an Android App that set alarms based on these cycles.  I rely heavily on the ""I am going to sleep now button, when should I wake up.""

I decided to create my own app, even though there may be others, because I wanted to learn about the platform.

Foreground:
I like the Android environment.  I also think if I ever had a decent idea, I could create some decent resume sauce.  I did not realize that certain devices support permissions, but do not actually let you access the apps.  My galaxy S2 from ATNT supports the SetAlarm permission.  My galaxy S2 does not support opening the built-in alarm application.

Best thing learned:
queryIntent() generates a list of all things that can handle your intent.  If the size is 0 or points to null, toss an exception, horray.",,False,self,t5_2reen,False,,,True,t3_r2fb7,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/r2fb7/dev_sleep_cycles_tries_to_regulate_your_sleeping/,

I know aDosBox and AnDosBox are both out there, but they're slow to the point of being unplayable and I figure eliminating a middleman would be to the benefit of both speed and battery life.

I know little to nothing about programming, so this is more a general question of how this might be done. How would the original (engine) code be handled, if at all? Would the entire game need to be re-coded into java or something? What about assets -- are there specific formats that must be used, or can the old ones (usually just container files) be used with the right coding? I sort of understand how one could handle input, so that's pretty much taken care of.

Again, more a conceptual thing, as I have no idea how to actually do this stuff. Is there a set of rules for handling C/C++ in java or is it all handled on a case-by-case basis?",,False,self,t5_2reen,False,,,True,t3_qd7d4,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/qd7d4/porting_opensource_dos_games_over_to_android/,

1370522738.0,21,self.androidapps,1fsc4s,PSA: Be weary of anti-theft apps and their claims! (like Cerberus.),jkrill,34,13,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/1fsc4s/psa_be_weary_of_antitheft_apps_and_their_claims/,"I've loved this app since it came out. I paid for it, and it's been installed on my Nexus 7 and Galaxy Nexus since I've owned them. Unfortunately, we never truly know how well they perform until it's too late. Previously I used Prey, and this caution applies regardless of the application (unless it includes some sort of guarantee).

My Nexus 7 was stolen in Puerto Rico. This device is WiFi only, and WiFi was spotty there. So when I opened up cerberusapp.com and selected my device, there was no surprise it couldn't connect to it. However, after contacting Cerberus support, I was assured that sending the ""Start emergency mode"" command would cause emergency mode to be activated next time the device connected to the Cerberus servers. 

Fast-forward 4 months. I have my devices set to snap a photo and email me if the wrong pass code is entered twice. Out of the blue, I received one of these emails from my Nexus 7! It was a lovely photo of whoever was now enjoying my tablet: http://imgur.com/DzVp099. Unfortunately the photo had no additional information (EXIF or otherwise): no GPS coordinates, and *not even the date the photo was actually taken*! The email time stamp indicated when it was *sent* to the Cerberus servers, but there was no way of knowing when the actual image was taken! It could have been taken months ago and just finally connected to WiFi and sent the image along. I immediately logged into Cerberus, but the device was no longer connected. I sent a few more ""start emergency mode"" commands just for good measure, and waited. About a day later also emailed Cerberus support. They confirmed there was no additional info to be gained, but they *were* able to tell me that the tablet had last connected to the Cerberus servers a full 18 hours or so AFTER the image was sent. And this was definitely AFTER I sent the emergency mode commands again! But I never got the emergency mode alerts that should have given me the tablet's location. I followed up with support to find out why my tablet never actually went in to emergency mode even though it clearly connected after sending these commands. But they appear to have stopped responding to me at this point. Or maybe they're still investigating. I'll update this post if I hear back.

**But the moral of the story is**: You never really know how well these applications work until it's too late. As in my case. The tablet SHOULD HAVE sent me it's location as soon as it connected to the Cerberus servers. But it didn't. Twice. And there's no explanation from the developer. I loved this app when I didn't actually have to rely on it, but now I'm very, very weary about it.

1361877801.0,20,self.androidapps,1995ud,Gainos Fresh Wallpapers - Auto changing wallpapers and Daydream screensaver from the best photos on Flickr,alinium,31,11,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/androidapps/comments/1995ud/gainos_fresh_wallpapers_auto_changing_wallpapers/,"Hi guys,

I'd like to introduce my app: **Gainos Fresh Wallpapers**. It auto changes your wallpaper with the best photos on Flickr at the interval you choose. It is also one of the handful of apps that comes with Daydream functionality allowing you to view a stream of Flickr's 'Explore' photos with a Ken Burns Effect.


**Features:**

* Images are selected at random from the 'Explore' stream at Flickr (http://www.flickr.com/explore/).
* Remembers last 10 wallpapers so you can go back and choose one you previously liked.
* Choose to change the wallpaper as frequently as 10 minute to as slow as once every week.
* Enable Daydream mode on JellyBean+ devices to start screensaver when device is docked.
* Share images with your social networks.
* Works well with tablets and phones. For high resolution displays a higher quality image is downloaded.
* Choose to download new wallpapers only over wifi to save cellular bandwidth.
* Minimal interface that stays out of your way. Just start the service once and forgot about the app.

So I started looking around and found LightFlow. Well, the full version lets you do all kinds of apps without needing to be rooted so I thought I would try that out by downloading an APK from the internet to see if it worked (I had all intentions of buying it if it did work). When I tried it out, it was terrible. The interface was beautiful but nothing actually worked. Not a single LED notification went off for me. 

Then I thought it may have been the apk I got so I went and downloaded the free one from the official google play store and it didnt work either. It worked a little better, but not the way its supposed to.

The reason I made Medicine Reminder was simple - I kept forgetting to take my blood pressure medicine which is not just inconvenient but rather dangerous. 

All the similar apps I found are way too feature packed - I have to take my medicine once a day at any time. All I wanted was it te remind me every morning. I didn't want sound or vibration notifications, just a simple message to status bar for then I wake up. 

Medicine reminder only has 1 button - for marking that you have taken your medicine today. Every morning at 7 AM it throws a status bar notification reminding you to take your medicine. It disappears once you press the only button in app. 

The app is free (and ad-free) and currently localized to English and Estonian. If you wish, I can add other localizations with next update (it's so simple it only has few text strings to translate).

Could you please try my new app ""Brake Indicator"" and let me know what you think. I very appreciate your feedback to know how to improve my app.


App includes speedometer and GPS-based G-force meter and allows users to control average daily braking/acceleration G-force for many days. The idea is to calculate average daily braking G-force and acceleration G-force and show historical graph.

&gt; Have the ability to change the settings and functionality of certain features of the app

&gt; Much, much more extras



Installation notes:
Drag app onto the drive of your phone either via USB or download through the phone's web browser.
After download/getting it on the phone, if you have downloaded it through the phone, you can go to the notification area and tap it and use Package Installer, if through usb, you can navigate to the file through some file explorer (Astro is a free android app that does such). Navigate to the file through your file explorer and install using Package Installer. *Note: You may need to allow installation of non-Market apps in your system settings on your phone*

Enter the promotional code provided in the email that was sent to you and you should be all good. (Setting the live wallpaper should be the same as any other, just hold on the background of your phone with 1 finger until a selection pops up asking you what type of background do you want to set, go to Live Wallpapers and when it shows Gallery3D select it and let it load on the screen to give you the proper preview, then set as Wallpaper).


Thank you Reddit and hope that everyone can enjoy our live wallpaper as much as we enjoy making them. =)

I've been relying on Google Calendar since I've been an android user, and while it serves much of my needs, I wish it could do more than schedule appointments and set reminders. For example, with my previous (physical) calendar/organizer, there were spaces on each day, week, and month, for me to write notes, to-do lists, etc.

Integration with Google Tasks helps a bit, but I still find the functionality isn't all there for me. I know I can put due-dates on my tasks, but I'd like to have a to-do list for a particular day/week/month, and have that list saved on that day/week/month so if I go back and look at that same time period, I can see what I did, what I missed, etc. Also, if I complete a task on google tasks, there is no date associated with it. It'd be nice if when I check something off my list, it makes a note of it in my calendar indicating when that task was completed.

There are a couple apps in the Play store I've wanted to try, but have been having some issues. I installed the free version of beOrganized, but it always fails to launch on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus. CalenGoo looks interesting, but there is no free version, and I don't want to pull the trigger on something I haven't really experienced.

Can anyone vouch for these apps, or suggest something to suit my needs?

Electrum has actually been out since 2009, but I constantly add new features! The latest features allow playing the drum pads with a MIDI controller, and also the ability to load MIDI drum patterns. 

There is a demo version you can try, although that does not have the MIDI controller ability just yet.

Song selection?  App features?  Are there any other ones I don't know about?

I've been using Spotify for a while, and I like the song selection and everything, but the app drives me to the brink of insanity.  I'm still using the old app (the dark grey one) which has some issues on 4.1+ (crashing, weird navigation bugs where you have to click things twice - things like that) because I absolutely cannot use the newer versions.

I don't know what's going on with the Spotify dev team, but the newest version of the application is utterly useless.  

- It doesn't work with MP3's on my phone, which worked flawlessly and integrated into my library on the old app.

- They took out the damn ""Library"" section.  WHY?  It was there before, why would you remove such a fundamental thing?  It's just all playlists now.  Honestly, there are two really basic things I want a music app to do.  Play my music, and organize my music.  This app succeeds in only one of the two.  It absolutely baffles me that they would remove the Library, a basic alphabetical layout of all of your songs.

- It now takes three or four clicks to star a song (going through a menu or two for each song), whereas in the old version it took only one.

- The ""filter"" option - which was in the old library - is gone.  I used to use this to quickly find songs in my library by typing the first few letters of a title or artist.  Now if I want to find a song, I have to actually search Spotify's entire catalog, even if it's in my library.  I can't easily navigate to it, because...

- Everything is in ""last added"" chronological order.  What the actual fuck.  It's bad enough that I have to organize everything by playlist (which I don't really use), but even the ""starred"" section - which lists all of my songs - is in order by the most recently starred or added.  There is no way to alphabetize songs, no way to filter by artist, album, title, or any other meta data.

I have to admit, I did something stupid.  I signed up for both Rdio and MOG at one point, but since I was busy with other things I never really had a chance to build a library with them and spend some time with the apps before the free trials ran out, so I'm hoping other people have had more thorough experiences with them and can recommend something else.

[[Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accusoft.usbscannerfree)]

So I'm a developer involved with a fun project at work, where we directly communicate to the scanner via the USB bus to bring documents to your SD card as [JPG, BMP, TIF, PDF]. As far as I'm aware, this is the first time something like this has been attempted on Android. I was hoping I could get some feedback from this sub-reddit, as to scanners that work / don't, good UI, bad UI, did you like it, etc.

We've been testing a number of the most popular mobile scanners on Amazon &amp; will have a hotfix out for a number of scanner drivers / features [aka calibrate] within the week hopefully. Additionally, we're going to be working very actively with the SANE group and scanner manufacturers on getting any missing scanner drivers up and running &amp; to submit patches back to the open source community. It's also built to integrate nicely with apps like Evernote, Gmail, etc. [aka scan directly to a file attachment].

*Easy to use score keeping app for playing snooker.*

**Features:**

* Quick and intuitive user interface. - Just press the ball that was pocketed to add on the points.
* Save multiple games and return to them later - Have ongoing games with your friends!
* Edit the table - Play a short game with less reds, or adjust a handicap.
* Undo function - With history for whole frame.

There's also an [online demo version](http://snooker.rickels.co.uk) available.

I've tried to adhere to the Android style guidelines as much as possible, and concentrated on making the interface easy to use. I'm a web dev during the day, so PhoneGap was the easiest way in for me. I was worried it wouldn't feel native, but it seems to be really responsive.

It's my first app, so I'm sure I've probably made some schoolboy errors. Any feedback would be great, thanks!

i previously used [root call blocker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fahrbot.apps.rootcallblocker.pro) and call master from the same dev.
but not only is the ui quite ugly, both also have some sort of ugly drm, where the application has to connect to the dev's server every so often and then sometimes forces the user do update or it stops working. it also transmits data every day, not only over wifi, but the mobile network too.
and to top it, if the app doesn't get root access, for instance after an ota system update, it constantly shows an annoying popup explaining that is has no root access, every few seconds, that can only be removed with either root access obviously or an uninstall.
the developer is also quite arrogant, so talking to him isn't easy...

anyways, those are my reasons to look for a new solution. i'm currently trying [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vladlee.blacklistplus), the ui doesn't look to good though :(

I logged into the Swype Beta installer (why doesn't this thing just store your info? Probably the same reason Swype isn't in the Play Store) and it's letting me download it again. So, maybe I just got a corrupted download. Just putting it out there, you should back up the app before installing it. A broken Play Store update would be easier to fix.

Swype beta update *seems* to work, but it cleared data. And then wanted me to sign up for Swype Connect again, on the same email address as always... I've ""registered"" for this so many times, is each one after the first just the same as logging in, or what? Guess I'll find out when I try to cuss on it.

This is a fun little silly game that has you popping colorful pigs so you can harvest the sweet bacon found within!

**The Basics** 

Bouncing pigs are coming at you, tap them to pop them. 

Each pig adds to the Bacon Meter, builds combo counter, and rewards points.

If the Bacon Meter is full, X2 score, if it empties, you lose. 

Hit the pigs on the first try and don't let any get past to build a high combo, the combo counter is added to your score with each pig you pop. 

Don't pop the bomb pigs, they will destroy all pigs on the screen, which wastes bacon and lowers the Bacon Meter. 

___

As mentioned before, currently the game is free with no ads. I would like to keep ads out of this game, as they just annoy people. The end goal is to have a free version (what you see here with graphics and audio updates) and a paid version, which will also have access to DLC, which will be free cosmetic changes (like hats for pigs and new backgrounds)

I am making a kickstarter to try to raise enough dough to get an online scoreboard up and running. Right now it is only local score.

A few months ago I asked on r/Android about ways of automatically moving files around my phone. I was getting annoying by different camera apps saving stuff all over my phone. Some in SD DCIM, some in their own app folders, and some in the external_SD DCIM folder...   

I recently found this tiny free &amp; adfree app called **[FolderSurveillance](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.z589.foldersurveillance)**   

It's incredibly simple, and let's you create folder/file tasks (moving / copying or erasing) and automate them.  Here is a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/qcHuU.png) of one of my tasks, which moves photos from the SD card camera folder to the external_SD card folder.

The app is tiny (73k) and requires no funky permissions. Although you might want to install [OI File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager) if you'd like this app to let you browse for folders / files. Otherwise you would have to type in the path to the folders you want it to automate.   

Anyways, I am in no way affiliated with the app or the developer. Hope some of you might find this useful!

You can track beers, liquor, cigarettes, money, ""custom"" item and specify them (kind, brand, currency) too.

Once again, I would love feedback. The only thing worse than not getting any buyers was not getting a single reason why nobody wanted to buy the app.

If you like the game or appreciate my effort, please consider buying the no-ad version by the same name (but without the ""Free"" part). I plan on adding more features to the full version in the future.

It is a social locations sharing application, something similar to Foursquare and the like, that allows you to Tag(check-in) places/locations.

**Features:**

*  Users can Tag locations and leave a message
*  View Tags that were created by friends
*  View Tags for locations that are close to your current location from any user
*  Has a Locator service that when enable will allow your friends to see your current location in real-time.
*  View friends location in real-time if they have the Location service running.
*  Invite friends via SMS

**Things I plan to add:**

* Allow users to add photos/video to Tags
* Allow users to invite other users to their friends list
* Allow users to filter location list by category when creating a Tag
