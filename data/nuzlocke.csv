This is a randomizer program that takes a different route to the Reasonable gen3 randomizer recently released - instead of randomizing one set of games extremely thoroughly it aims to randomize every Pokemon game equally well, if not as thorough. It fills in the gaps of other randomizer programs by allowing full randomization of Gen4 &amp; Black2/White2 ROMs - something that could only be previously partially achieved using cheats.

Right now it supports every main-series English ROM, and can randomize the following things in them:

 * Starter Pokemon
 * Wild Pokemon
 * Trainers Pokemon
 * Pokemon Base Stats
 * Pokemon Types
 * Pokemon Abilities
 * Pokemon Movesets
 * TM Moves
 * TM/HM Learnability
 * Static Pokemon (e.g. given by NPCs, buyable at the casino, etc)
 * The moves that Move Tutors teach, in certain games where they are particularly significant.


The [download is here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/downloads/detail?name=UPRandomizer-120a.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=) and you can get the source code [here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Frandomizer)

The [version which doesn't need an external config directory is here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/downloads/detail?name=UPRandomizer-120a-InternalConfig.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=). Use this if the original complains about missing config files even after extraction.

Future features:

 * Much more support for non-English ROMs
 * Foreign language support for the program itself
 * More cool ASM hacks that you can apply to the games to customize your experience a little bit further.

Feedback, criticism and suggestions are extremely welcome. This was very fun to make.

Here's the deal, I'm in a battle against a bug trainer, and switch training my Togepi. Before I switch out on each Pokemon, I'd use Metronome for the sake of seeing what it would give me.

So first Pokemon comes out, it's a Cascoon. Metronome came up with nothing interesting, so I switched out and kill it.

Next Pokemon, Beedrill. I send out Togepi again and use Metronome...

...Ingrain.

*Fuck.* (if you didn't realise, Ingrain stops you from switching out).

I manage to defeat Beedrill with a few Metronomes, Sweet Kisses and potions, *only two left to take on*.

Next up, Silcoon. Shouldn't be too hard, only has Harden anywa- *shit, I have 1 Metronome PP left...*

Metronome gave me Amnesia, +1 attack but nothing useful.

Next option? Sweet Kiss it to death... except I only have 4PP left... The confusion took it down to less than half health, but the problem was lying in that I had two attacks left...


*Growl and Charm*


After around 30 useless Growls/Hardens, I watched the poor Cascoon struggle itself to death. Up next? Beautifly. Here's the situation:


Togepi lv12 (w/ Ingrain)
2 Potions
Growl
Charm

*vs*

Beautifly lv 10
Absorb


This might take a while.

As it turned out, Absorb was doing 3 damage points per turn to me, but I was healing 1 each turn thanks to Ingrain. Throughout this I continues Growling/Charming, but it didn't affect the Absorb.

I soon used up my two potions, and Beautifly ran out of Absorb PP... More struggling it is then. Thanks to the -6 attack and Ingrain, struggle was dealing 1HP damage to both Pokemon. But Beautifly had more health than Togepi.
There was nothing I could do about it.
All I could do was use Charm unsucessfully as I watched Togepi being slowly murdered.
All that effort for nothing, I was going to lose him.

But suddenly...

*Togepi has no PP left. Togepi used struggle.*

*Beautifly fainted.*

I had been using a Linoone named Delilah (and earlier a zigzagoon named Rosco)which had pickup, so I went to my items to use my pp ups before the battle.  Not only was I suprised to find I had 20+ pp ups, making pp a non-issue, but I also had a whopping 43 rare candy's I had amassed over the course of my journey.  This meant I got to raise each of my pokemon 7 levels, from 60 to 67.  Although I did have to grind to get to 60, having about 7 free levels on each pokemon (43 on the whole team) made the elite four an easy sweep with no losses.  
The moral of the story is to never overlook a seemingly weak or useless pokemon, as they may make your journey a lot easier.  I guess that means Nuzlocke worked, making me appreciate pokemon I never would have used otherwise.  
TL;DR: Pickup is OP shit.

* Torchic (Level 8)

* Electabuzz (Level 7)

* Phanpy (Level 7)

I just got to Petalburg and I head to the beach on the west to take on some trainers, having confidence in my team. I walk up to the first one and what does he throw out? 

A motherfucking Shedinja.

Now I go do some quick research to see if any of my pokemon can damage this dude, turns out that not a single one can do damage. So my plan now with this information is to use all of the PP with the pokemon who has the least (my Electabuzz) untill I can use struggle and take him down. I've got 5 potions and an Oran berry so I'm feeling pretty good. After what seems like forever, with only 3 PP left out of all of his moves, having used every single potion and my Oran Berry,  and the Shedinja's defense as low as possible, he kills my Electabuzz. I send out my Phanpy, knowing my fate is sealed. 

But then the cunt of a pokemon Shedinja ran out of moves. 

He used struggle.

He is hit by recoil. 

**HE FAINTS**

FINALLY!!!!! I BEAT IT!!!! I CAN""T FUCKING BELIE-

He sent out another Shedinja, and I had to watch him slowly kill the rest of my team.

1366400180.0,53,self.nuzlocke,1cp01k,Fitlocke - Getting fit while playing Pokemon!,aftersexpancake,61,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1cp01k/fitlocke_getting_fit_while_playing_pokemon/,"Hey guys,

Today, I had plenty of free time in the afternoon - I had nothing to do. I read about the Nuzlocke Challenge a while ago, and decided to give it a try on my old NDS. As I started to play (Pokemon Diamond, btw), I literally couldn't stop, but I felt some guilt for not doing my daily exercises. And then BAMM, and an idea was born.


I started to do exercises based on my actions in the game. This kept me interested in playing the game, and I also had the feeling that ""this day was not completely wasted"". Long term, this can be an effective method to get fit for someone, who plays alot of Pokemon, and otherwise would had no interest in doing exercises. Short term, it really helps dealing with all the frustration we all get during the game (when my poor Piplup died by an epic crit at lvl10, I did push-ups until I collapsed - and while I still felt sorry, I could get rid of that feeling of ""okay fuck it just revive him/start another game/etc. and move forward.""

My current system for Fitlocke is:

**- IF YOU DEFEAT A WILD POKEMON:** 7 Push-ups

**- IF YOUR POKEMON GETS A LEVEL:** 7 Sit-ups

**- IF YOU CATCH A POKEMON:** 7 Squats

**- IF YOUR POKEMON DIES:** An exercise of choice till you collapse!

**- IF YOU DEFEAT A TRAINER:** 5 Push-ups, Sit-ups and Squats

**- IF YOU DEFEAT GYM LEADER/TEAM LEADER/RIVAL:** 10 Push-ups, Sit-ups and Squats


While these numbers don't seem much, in a 1-hour Pokemon session you can easily do up to 200+ from almost everything.

NOTE: This is only an idea, I use for making Nuzlocke more fun and to keep myself fit. I'm open to improvements and tips, if you got some. Also, sorry for my English, it's not my first language. [but feel free to be grammar nazi and correct me, I want to get better. :P]

Have fun!

Had been doing my Nuzlocke run of Randomized Emerald. No losses yet, and feeling pretty good about my team. So while at the 5th gym, I faced off against a particularly cheeky trainer with a Slakoth in the ""Recovery Room.""  I figured my Hitmontop could easily shrug off a Scratch or whatever and OHKO with a Revenge...

Something is wrong, I thought.

""Odin used REVENGE."" 

Doesn't Revenge usually go last? Slakoth survives with 1 HP.

""SLAKOTH used COUNTER.""

Well shit. So now I'm out of a Hitmontop. But was a real dick move by Slakoth and I really liked that Hitmontop so I stick it to the man and keep using it. One trip to the Pokecenter later I enter battle with the last trainer before Norman. 

This time it is my Hitmontop vs. a Zangoose. This thing looks dangerous so I use a Bulk Up. He uses Slash which takes me to 60% HP. I heal up and he uses Swords Dance which is fine, because I'll just take him out with a Triple Kick. No, Zangoose doesn't like that and decides to survive and OHKO me with a crit. Well that is fair, I shouldn't have kept him anyways. I send in Pidgeot for the cleanup. 

But Nuzlocke has rules and Nuzlocke doesn't like it when people break those rules. Ace Trainer uses a Hyper Potion, Quick Attack barely scratchs Zangoose, Zangoose proceeds to Swords Dance again and sweep my team.

So uh, don't mess with Nuzlocke I guess.

That left Piertotem the Golem with 19 HP to stand alone versus a Dragonite and a Charizard. Several Hyper Potions and way too much adrenaline for comfort, and he did it.

I don't know how to re-randomize theirs or the pokemon of trainers). I just encountered a trainer in the first trick house with a Wobuffet. My Gengar, Spooky, was the first in line, so he was sent out. I quickly attempted a hypnosis to save myself, but it missed. ""Wobuffet used Destiny Bond!"" My blood ran cold, and, in a desperate attempt to save myself, I went to google.

Today I learned that Destiny Bond wears off after a turn. It saved Spooky.

I continued to spam Hypnosis with abandon after I learned that he could survive. Once it hit, I Night Shaded the heck out of that Wobuffet, occasionally re-applying sleep, until it was down. Spooky came out alive.

It occurred to me that r/nuzlocke may appreciate this tidbit, just in case some of you did not know. Hopefully in the future this will help someone stall out and then defeat a Wobuffet without the loss of a beloved teammate. (:

TL;DR, Destiny Bond's effect only lasts one turn. You can leave with your teammates intact.

Happy Nuzlockeing!

My Starmie (Ringo) was apparently able to survive a +1 X-Scissor from that monster, with a whopping 3 HP.

I lost my Dewott early on in Driftveil one level before he evolved to Clay's Excadrill. That was bad enough, but then I lost a Joltik almost immediately afterward to a random Zebstrika (also one level before he evolved).  And now, I just went through my absolute worst death, just before Victory Road.

By far, my favorite Pokemon on this run has been my Krookodile, ever since I caught it at the Desert Resort.  (I think part of the reason I liked him so much was because of the aforementioned deaths.)  But, he's been my most reliable teammate, and got me through a LOT of rough spots. I freaking loved that guy.  

And then, just after we defeated Drayden, we went to Route 10 and battled the first Trainer there.  My Krookodile was out first, and the girl sent out a Scrafty.  I expected to OKHO it with Brick Break, and almost did.  But the Scrafty survived with the tiniest sliver of red left.  And then it OHKOes me with a critical hit Hi-Jump Kick.  I have never been so upset over a death in my life.  I'm honestly choking up right now.  I know it's just a bunch of pixels but...man I can't even get the willpower to continue anymore.  The team seems so empty now.

Basically, I wanted to put myself on even ground with my rival.  If Gary MF Oak can get through half the game with less than a full team, why can't I?

So in my run I will consider my trainer to start the game with a belt that **can only hold one Pokemon at a time**.  After each rival battle, you gain another ""belt slot"" that allows you to carry **one additional Pokemon**.  You keep going like this until you reach the normal max of 6.  

So, for example, you get your starter and have a battle.  Win and you are now limited to **2**.
You'll soon run into him again.  He will have 2 and you will have 2.  Beat him and you will have a limit of **3**.  This does mean you won't be able to have a full team of six until **after** your 5th Gary battle (*which is the infamous Lavender Town one after the S.S. Anne*).  

This also roughly mimics the number your rival has through the game.  There will be one battle where he outnumbers you by one and one where you outnumber him by one, but that is pretty even.  I think it will make the rival battles through the first half of the game have a real risk/reward to them.  It will make the moment you can finally have a team of six feel so dang good, instead of hitting that shortly after beating Brock and being able to win much of the game due to superior numbers.  

It doesn't prevent you from your standard catching rules (at least in my version).  You enter a new area, get your one catch, but you have to deposit down to your current party limit as soon as you can.  You just have to manually simulate the way a game treats you when you have a full team.  It teleports to the PC and you can't use it unless you switch out.    

I haven't figured out a better name for it, so I've just been calling it a RivalLocke clause to your typical Nuzlocke rule set.  I have searched around but can't find anybody who has done this, but I apologize if this has been done before.

1359263607.0,31,self.nuzlocke,17ctfe,"A lot of people have been asking about different ways to Nuzlocke, so here's a list of some fun ideas!",ImDumbIrl,36,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/17ctfe/a_lot_of_people_have_been_asking_about_different/,"1. Limited number of Pokecenter uses ( for example, 1 use per town, gym leader beaten, etc.)

2. Typelink! This is a cool idea started by /u/Artegan which is best used on randomizers. Basically, you can catch a pokemon that shares a type with your last one. If you caught a Lapras on one route, you can either catch a water type or an ice type on the next route.

3. Deity Nuzlocke. This is another great idea, also by Artegan. The rules for this one say that your starter is your god, or deity. This pokemon MUST survive throughout the entire game. You must sacrifice the rest of your team if it dies.

4. Monotype Nuzlocke. This is a fairly simple idea. The rules are that every pokemon on your team has to share a type.

5. Themed Nuzlocke. This is a neat idea that you can be really creative with! Some themes could be Christmas ( pokemon like Sudowoodo,Delibird, Snover, and Stantler). There are a lot of pokemon that could fit in with other themes too, like Luvdisc or Ludicolo!

6. Comic or Story Nuzlocke! This is pretty self- explanatory, but I think it belongs here. Basically you either tell your Nuzlocke story through a comic strip or by writing a story.

7. Randomizer Nuzlocke. Everyone probably knows about this anyway, but randomizers make the wild pokemon completely random ( and sometimes the trainers' pokemon too!) 

8. Character Runs: These are also pretty fun. You take the team of a character ( for example, Blue) and you use their team that they use in game. You could also draw from other sources, like a Tv show.

9. Destiny Run: This is best done on R/B or Firered/Leafgreen, but it could be done in other generations. You use a random number generator 6 times and the numbers correspond to what pokemon you will use! You use the 6 pokemon chosen by the RNG or their pre evolutions, as long as they're in the same chain.

10. One Team Challenge: In this, you can only use the first six pokemon that you catch. However, you can skip routes if you wish. But once a pokemon dies, you can never have a full team.

I'm not sure if this helped or not, but I hope it did!

After recieving my badge from Sabrina I decide to take the cycling road to Fuschia... worst decision of Houdini's life. I'm fighting a lvl29 Mankey and he gets a karate chop off the open to put Houdini down at 60% HP. Houdini uses Psychic to take down the musclehead to a sliver of health. The mankey proceeds to outspeed me with fury swipes, 1st strike-Crit: Houdini at 20%, 2nd 3rd and 4th hits: Houdini at 1 HP... I proceed to pray to all of the various gods (in vain) Mankey lands a 5th and my all-star for Poison gym is gone.

* 2. only allowed to catch the first sighted pokemon in each route/cave (now I allow only 7 total pokemon)
* 3. The starter pokemon must be released after catching the first wild pokemon (i think starters are way too strong, I have gone through every game since gen 3 with only the starter, because it was faster)
* 4. Pokemon centers may not be used at all
* 5. Pokemon that have just been healed to *full* hp/status via an item, may be put into the PC to restore their PP
* 6. a slot must be open in the party to catch a new pokemon, to avoid it going to the pc and being fully healed without using an item.
* 7. only healing items/pokeballs may be used/bought/sold. HM's can only be used outside of combat. You may catch hm slaves if you have no other pokemon that can learn the required HM. HM slaves may not be used in battle *at all*.
* 8. 2 form pokemon may evolve at level 50, 3 form pokemon may evolve one time at 33, and again at 66.
8b- rule 8 may be ignored on 1 pokemon, if you choose to keep another pokemon first form forever.

*I am new to nuzlocke, but very experienced in competetive pokemon... I decided to start with my favorite game, soul silver. (though I would have chosen silver if my cmos battery wasn't dead)*

**Here is what happened**-

&gt;* used the trainer ID to determine my starter, it was cyndaquil, so my rival will be using tododile, probably the hardest possible, but oh well.

&gt;* after all the initial nonsense of starting the game, I caught my first pokemon: Pidgey Level 2, named Rock. At this time cindaquil was released. I also purchased some items, most importantly 2 antidotes, and some potions.

&gt;* Then I proceeded up the next route to quickly catch a 2nd pokemon. I got lucky and got a Weedle which I named Jazz. 

&gt;* So now I have 2 pokemon, and some potions.. time to try to get them higher in level..   I went to grind with pidgey in his home route, so i could find other level 2's for him to fight..  The first battle was pretty fierce, it was a speed tie, so I couldn't ever tell which would go first, and right before i was about to land the last hit, the enemy went first and got a critical hit for the win..  

*Rock my very first catch became the first fatality*

&gt;* So now I am in a pretty sticky situation, I have only a weedle... But luckily this weedle was higher level so he could safely grind a bit on the lower levels. I could only grind so much before i was down on potions, and I knew i had to start moving to the next town or i wouldn't have enough potions to make the journey with my lonely weedle.. 

&gt;* Weedle happened to be perfect for the journey because weedle being a poison type is immune to the main threat of the enemies, poison.

&gt;* I stumbled accross the south entrance to the dark cave, i knew i wouldn't be able to see, but it was a perfect opportunity to catch a new pokemon..  So i walked in, expecting something bad, and boy was I excited to see one of my childhood favorites: Geodude! I was kind of risky trying to catch it with a weedle, but i had no other choice.. after poisoning the geodude, and using a potion to keep weedle alive, i was able to catch the geodude, which I named ""Punk"" and gave an antidote. It was only level 4.  but it was the perfect type to grind against all the normal attacks which is resisted very well, it was also a perfect pokemon to fight Faulker, the flying gym leader. once I reached the next town, I was able to heal up at the pokecenter, and get some more potions. 

&gt;* I was very skeptical about entering the bellsprout tower with Punk(geodude), has a 4x vine whip would undoubtedly ohko him, even if he were higher level, let alone worrying about crits. So I decided that I needed a bit more firepower before that. I went to the beginning of the next route to catch another pokemon. I wasn't too impressed at the time, but I managed to catch an ekans(Rapps). Between ekans and weedle, the bellsprouts were no match and I gained some money from the trainers.. Also, I was really excited to have cought another pokemon within within the tower, which was a Rattatta. I could only think ""hyper fang yay"". I named Rattatta: Techno.

&gt;* So immidiately after the tower was finished I knew I needed to gather my money/potions, and start training Punk(Geodude). But I decided to try to train Techno (rattatta). It started out fine, but after a potion or 2 was used. 

*Techno ended up victim of a critical hit from a wild rattatta and become fatality #2.*

&gt;* After that loss, I was pretty short on potions, but luckily Punk(geodude) was pretty easy to train agaisnt normal types and didn't require a lot of healing as it usually took 1 damage per hit. Eventually Punk(Geodude) learned Rock throw at level 11, and I knew that was my chance.. I only had 1 or 2 potions left, so it was do or die. Faulkner did fall though, with the combination of rock polish and rock throw, geodude beat the roost user.

&gt;* In the next route I had to use Rapps(Ekans) a lot in the next area due do the poison and grass types. If there was ever a normal or rock type i changed over to Punk(geodude). Things went pretty smoothly to the 2nd gym.. I ended up catching 2 Zubats, one in the cave, and 1 in the slowpoke well, and another Ekans which was lower level. (Trance, Beat, and Appes Respectively)

&gt;* The bug gym was cake for Punk(Geodude), who was now level 22. Rapps(Ekans) was level 17, and the rest of the party was pretty low level. Now this is where the run gets fun..  as I am going to leave town 3, I get challanged by my rival, which i was completely un-prepared for. I lead with Rapps, and killed 1 of his pokemon no problem. Then he put out croconaw..  Rapps was doing ok, but was in danger of a possible critical death, and I hadnt seen croco use any water moves yet, so i figured I might be able to switch into Geodude, and do a quick magnitude and kill him..  I got 1 magnitude off which did right around 50% of croconaw's health.. Good, one more and I was in the clear.. but unfortunately, croconaw was faster and decided to finally use water gun after about 10 turns of everything else. Punk(Geodude), level 22, my strongest pokemon became the third fatality, and easily the hardest to take so far. Rapps(ekans) came back out to finish off the Croconaw and Zubat that remained. Which pushed him to level 18.

*Punk the Geodude, my 3rd catch, and strongest pokemon is no more*

&gt;* On my way to goldenrod, I picked up another weedle(Rave), and I missed a rattatta due to a critical hit. Once I got to golden rod, I went north to fight the trainers for money, and catch some more pokemon in the park and route 36. I got a Drowzee(Waltz) and yet another weedle(Drumstick) lol..    After buying some fresh waters, and grinding for a while, I had Rapps(ekans) at level 26, and Waltz(Drowzee) at level 20. I figured this should be fine to kill a level 17 clefairy and level 19 miltank.

&gt;* After fighting my way to the goldenrod gym leader, my party of 6 was in tact..  I had all 3 lower level weedles (Jazz, Rave, and Drumstick), 2 Ekans (Rapps and Appes) and Drowzee(Waltz) ready to roll. Unfortunetly in my overconfidence, I didnt feel the need to buy more fresh water with the money from the trainers in the gym, so i went into the battle with 2 fresh waters.. and I felt extremely good about Rapps(ekans) just learning stockpile...   

&gt;* So Clefairy goes down without too much trouble from metronome.. but right when miltank came out, i realized one fatal flaw in my plan.. ATTRACT.   Miltank was able to attract Rapps, which was supposed to be my trump card here. I paralyzed miltank with Glare, and the proceeded to beat on her, but it wasn't doing much, and I literally didn't get a single s.def reduction off with my acid attacks..  So I would just sit there stockpiled up with defence, and pray for paralyzed, and pray for my moves to actually work...   I thought maybe i could PP stall into struggles, but that time never came at all. Eventually, miltank would get lucky via crits and multiple rollouts, which would force me to switch several times qucikly killing off the weedles, and then even drowzee was forced to fall..  After everything was said and done, It was down to Rapps, who was low on PP, zero healing items in stock... and a massive chance to do nothing due to attract. I don't even beleive it right now, but It came down a few turns of miltank being fully paralyzed, while Rapps was immobiliazed by love, and then Miltank flinching from bites..  and on the last turn when Rapps had only 3 hp left, Miltank missed the rollout, and Rapps got the last bite off and one the battle. 

*Jazz the weedle, 2nd captured pokemon was dead*

*Waltz the Drowzee also dead*

*Appes the ekans, Rapps' partner in intimation tactics, RIP*

*Rave the weedle, dead*

*Drumstick the weedle, gone*

&gt;* After all was said and done, Rapps(ekans) was the sole survivor, and had to watch all of his comrades new and old get slaughtered. The only one left was Trance the zubat who had been boxed for the battle. So many shattered dreams..  All those times I imagined Jazz being a beedrill, and Waltz being a hypno, crushing the elite four...  Just faded away like dust in the wind.

&gt;* Rapps and I decided that we had to go to the elite four, because too many would have died in vain if we didn't go all the way now.



&gt;* In the next route, I caught a hoothoot(hiphop), and Stantler(Tango). Stantler seemed to be an awesome addition, rocking hypnosis, STAB stomps, and intimidate. Too bad it was so short lived. In the next town I proceeded into the burned tower...  the surprise battle with my rival went a lot better than expected, as Rapps(ekans) was untouchable with Stockpile boosts. I also caught another Rattatta(Dubstep) here.

&gt;* But the saddest moment of all time had to come before I even left the tower. I wanted to beat all the trainers in the tower for the money and experience, and I knew that Rapps could do it easily. So I am up against a level 18 charmeleon, which has been intimidated. I figure he is going to use special fire attacks, so I stockpile just to be sure I'm not in danger. and then I figure glare to make double sure..  So after 2 embers, and a bunch of other fights, Rapps(Ekans) is down to around 40/67 hp, no real danger from this charmeleon who is dealing about, 3-4 damage per ember right? But then after glare misses, the charmeleon goes first next turn with a nice little move called Dragon Rage.

&gt;* As I watch Rapps Health plumet, I kept thinking, no... no NO.. It can't possibly deal exactly the damage that I had in HP? I must have 1 hp left.. just 1, please god..   Rapps Fainted.  

&gt;* My spirit was destroyed, but I had to keep going. I'm not exactly sure what happened after that, but stantler came out and got ohko'd by dragon rage also. I know he had more than 40 max hp, but maybe in the greif i hadn't paid attention to the current hp..  Stantler fell as well, and the rest of the team were just lambs to the slaughter. Ending my first nuzlocke. 

*Rappes the Ekans, level 28 Lie here*

*Tango the stantler, we didn't know eachother long, but you were a great pokemon*

*Trance the zubat, you were meant to fly*

*Hip-Hop the hoothoot, you were absolutely useless*



&gt;I am currently attempting it again, but doing much better. I am thinking about possible doing a comic, but I would need to develop a lot fo skill in writing... so I decided to try some nonsense here first.. and this was quite a dramatic experience for me.. so I had to document it somehow. lol ",,False,self,t5_2setk,1366287884.0,,317,True,t3_18dx26,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/18dx26/extra_hard_rules_and_a_minor_story/,

This way when they crit, you wont be caught off guard. 2) Guard your fucking rock and steel Pokemon like your mother's life depended on it.

* And, never, ever think, ""Oh, he has a weakness, but he'll live,"" or ""I'll just use Metronome once, nothing too bad can come of it, right?"" - [AnEpicPerson](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c2wrcc1)

* 1) Grind like hell (I know this has already been stated, but it needs to be said again! YOU CANNOT GO THROUGH THE GAME UNDERLEVELED AND EXPECT TO WIN!!!)
2) Try to get a well-balanced team. Don't just pick your favorites out of your catches, because some of the Pokemon you don't like could be the ones to save your ass. I used to hate Zubat, and then I nuzlocked with a Zubat/Golbat and he saved my ass many times (and then Gary Motherfucking Oak killed him DD:)
3) Unless you're doing a blind run, Smogon, Bulbapedia, and Serebii are your friends. Use them to get info on the Gym Leaders, E4, and Rival battles so that you aren't surprised. - [Akitcougar](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c3jh130?context=3)

* I think it's important to note that many people end up finishing their Nuzlocke runs with a lot of cash. SPEND IT. Potions etc are extremely important. - [RadiantSun](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c3qelg4)

* A good way to counter explosions is to find a Pokemon with [Damp](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damp_%28ability%29) or a sturdy ghost type, preferably Dusclops, Cofagrigus, or Sableye because they'll probably survive other attacks. If you are caught against an exploder without defense, you can use fly and have a chance of not being hit, but your best bet is to switch to something with high health or, if worst comes to worst, your weakest link.  
EDIT Also, if you're playing first gen, avoid the move Rage like the plague. The mechanics here trap you in it until either you or the opponent dies. In all games, avoid Thrash, Petal Dance, Outrage, etc. - [copernicusthursday](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c4d1wox)

* Watch out for hyper fang, I'm not entirely sure why, but it seems to kill of one of my Pokemon every game. Having fewer Pokemon can actually make the run easier. It's riskier as well though. When you get a fishing rod, remember that you can go back and catch something in a lot of the towns. It'll probably be a Magikarp most of the time, but that's good too. Traded Pokemon get 1.5x exp, try to look for trades in game as it helps a lot with grinding. In FireRed and LeafGreen, you can always get a Diglett or Dugtrio in Diglett cave. Dugtrio is a great Pokemon to have since he has great speed, attack, and learns a lot of great moves Remember that pokemon like Kadabra, Haunter and Gravler can't be evolved if you're playing on an emulator. Have fun! - Kaielll

I recently started my first Nuzlocke ever. I'm on a DS copy of HG, using the rules, 1: Fainting is death, 2: Only catch the first you find in each area; no duplicates, 3: No legendaries/masterball, and of course nicknames. Through my playthrough, the main thing I was noticing is that I experienced very few deaths compared to the accounts and comics I had read. Through the first seven gyms, my only loss was my Golem, Gooch (3 - 27).

Then, I hit Claire.

I had gotten a bit cocky, as my team was fucking fantastic. Gengar, Nidoking, Togekiss, Starmie, Meganium and Jolteon. The latter was a real winner; I'd lucked out getting a modest Eevee, and this Jolteon, Firo, was a powerhouse, especially with Choice Specs. I had been kicking ass, essentially. However, this carelessness led me to make two mistakes. One was simply not levelling enough for the battle with the eighth Leader; I was overconfident that my super-effective hits would be enough. Two, I neglected to check what Kingdra's weaknesses were. So after my Starmie Aegis swept the floor with her Dragonairs, I put out Firo to match her Kingdra. Even at a level deficit, I was positive that with over 100 Spa, Choice Specs, and STAB Thunder, I had it in the bag, lest I missed. Once it hit, I did a double take as Kingdra's health bar stopped in the red with what apparently wasn't a super-effective attack, and I watched in horror as it landed a Hydro Pump that tore through Firo, regardless of his fairly good Spd.

Before I could even recover from the shock of losing him, I had switched into my Togekiss, Apollo, who had my next best defenses with some strong special attacks as well. Suddenly, critical hit Hydro Pump... OHKO.

I had it easy. I did not yet understand Nuzlocke for what it truly is. I guess reading about these tragedies wasn't enough - I had to experience it. However, I have not given up... not yet.",,False,self,t5_2setk,1346720650.0,,,True,t3_z5wuo,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/z5wuo/how_the_true_darkness_of_nuzlocke_was_suddenly/,

I managed to catch a wild Shedinja early on around Rustboro. What an interesting character to involve in a nuzlocke! 1 HP, but so much immunity. I felt that he had great potential. I was so careful with him, never let him face an enemy who could potentially know a super effective move. I protected my fragile warrior diligently! 

But then a tragedy struck that I had not forseen. My ghostly bug went up against a humble fisherman's Tentacool--a safe opponent I thought. Tentacool quickly inflicted confusion with Supersonic and immediately after, my Shedinja took his single precious HP with his own claws. I don't know why he did it... maybe Tentacool really did twist his mind, or maybe he could not endure the hardship of the nuzlocke challenge. Either way, it was a devestating and tragic loss. Let this be a warning to fellow Shedinja trainers... confusion hits hard.

Going to push on, but I'm a little depressed:( I guess Mr Krabs will have to do for now

Is your ROM glitching out? Color glitches, black screens, pokeballs turning without anything being sent out? All of the above even? Well that's a measure that nintendo does to stop pirates, and if you're trying to patch a ROM hack such as Storm Silver, then a pirated file is the only way.

GET ON WIF IT, WHAT'S THE SOLUTION!? Whoa, whoa sorry man. The answer to all your problems is here!

http://www.mediafire.com/download/74qgcvm4uv11qh7/HGSSrudolfpatch%28U%29%28EU%29V2.rar Password is dth

So here's what you gotta do. Download the file, extract it to your desktop. Now DL a Soul Silver .nds file, available from Cool Roms or such. Put them next to each other on the desktop for convenience. If you've DLed everything correctly, you should have something like this. http://imgur.com/Qds66CX

Now the next part is the simplest, just drag the .nds file into the hammer logo. You should get a notification that the patch was successful.

CONGRATULATIONS, you've patched that .nds file! You should be good to go now. Simply load up the Soul Silver.nds file from before, but now it's patched!

Hoovy's note: occasionally you'll still get a graphical glitch, just save and reload. It should be gone. GOOD LUCK DUDES.

edit: not trying to be cocky, but maybe this could get a sidebar? A lot of people have this problem.",,False,self,t5_2setk,1370210278.0,,333,True,t3_1fi7xo,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1fi7xo/tutorial_on_how_to_patch_a_soul_silver_rom/,

My name is BlackLightAttack, I run a very popular Nuzlocke series on YouTube, and I want to ask you something!",BlackLiteAttack,28,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/purn3/hi_my_name_is_blacklightattack_i_run_a_very/,"Hey there r/nuzlocke. My name is Nick Jenkins, better known as BlackLightAttack on the interwebs. You may have seen my Leaf Green Nuzlocke series posted here ~weekly. Although my videos don't have the same sort of viewcount as videos like Pokemon in Real Life and Pokemon Awesome, they are the first video search return for ""Pokemon"" on YouTube. The first episode in the series has over 250,000 views as of this writing, and every subsequent episode eventually crawls up to 50,000 views after enough time.

Anyway, enough with the statistics. Want do I want from you? I want your opinions! My first series is coming to an end soon, as in the latest episode I just defeated Giovanni. This means I need to start thinking about what I want to do for my second series.

I believe I've decided on Pokemon Platinum for my next run. LG is a remake of the games that I originally started on as a child, and Generation IV is the generation that got me back into the series as a teenager, so I thought it'd be appropriate. 

Now, here's where you guys come in. I've been thinking of deviating from simply running the Nuzlocke, and doing something else entirely. A randomizer could be fun, but I believe it's only available for Emerald right now? Anyway, I think an Egglocke (Eggscramble+Nuzlocke) is the way to go because 1) it's something different, and 2) it gets the community involved.

Would any of you guys be interested in seeing/helping me do an Egglocke, or would you rather watch me simply Nuzlocke Platinum? I would probaly do Egglocke rules set up like this:

&gt;1) If a pokemon dies, it's dead forever.

&gt;2) Must catch the first pokemon in every new area.

&gt;3) If the catch fails, no new pokemon for that area.

&gt;4) If it succeeds, the caught pokemon is brought back to a pokecenter to be exchanged for one of the eggs I have received.

&gt;5) In the interest of time, I'll keep a pokemon with Flame Body or Magma Armor 
in my box to aid in hatching eggs more quickly, although it may never be used in battle.

&gt;6) In the interest of time, I'll Pokesav myself 99 Rare Candies. They will be used on a new hatch to bring it up to the level of the wild pokemon it was exchanged for. In exchange for this convenience, I am absolutely forbidden from ever using a Rare Candy on a pokemon after its initial hatch-leveling. 

&gt;7) All eggs must be legitimate and bred in legitimate games. No unbreedable pokemon, absolutely no legendaries, no adjusted stats or abilities, etc. 

&gt;8) Nicknames :D

Of course, as each new egg is received I will give the Original Trainer a shoutout in the video, and probably give feedback on their choice of pokemon (""Oh sweet, a Pawniard! Interesting choice!"" or ""Oh, another Rattata! *I will kill your family.*"")

So what do you guys think? Egglocke or continue with traditional Nuzlocke? If Egglocke, would enough people be willing to contribute here or should I take it to r/pokemonscramble? Lemme know!

(p.s., I'm not asking for any eggs right now, I haven't even started the game and most likely won't for a while yet - I have to finish LG first! I'll certainly let you guys know if and when I'm read to start accepting eggs.)

**EDIT:** Sounds like you guys are interested! That's great. There is some concern about whether or not I will be able to actually receive a trade on a emulator, but it's not a problem because I do own an R4 card.

Please check here before posting a question about rules of a Nuzlocke run, as it could be answered. If it isn't here, please also use the search bar before posting to see if it's been answered already. If there is a question you feel should be answered here, or something should be changed, please tell me! Also, please note that most of these answers are just what most people would say, but it is your Nuzlocke, so you don't have to do what everyone else does.**

**The most commonly asked questions of all time:**

**I changed the rules a little, is this okay?**

Of course. This is your Nuzlocke, go for it!

**What game should I Nuzlocke?**

If you're just beginning, go for the game you're most familiar with. Willing to put yourself through the worst playthrough of Pokemon you've had? See below.

**General**

**What is the most challenging game to Nuzlocke?**

BlazeBlack, VoltWhite, and other hacks are generally much harder than the actual games. However, if you don't want a hack, choose the game you are the least familiar with. You won't know what Pokemon are in each area, etc. To help with this, you could set rules so you can't use Bulbapedia, Smogon, or any other walkthrough or informative site to help you. Additionally, you can add a lot of rules to make it harder- no PokeCenter, etc.

**Why is a Nuzlocke called a Nuzlocke?**

In the very first Nuzlocke run, the player had a Nuzleaf who looked like a character named Locke from the TV show *Lost.* It was the first Pokemon he had caught other than his Treecko, and so it was decided to call it a Nuzlocke challenge, because of the ""Nuz"" in ""Nuzleaf"" and the ""Locke"" in ""Locke.""

**Catching Rules**

**What are the standard catching rules of a Nuzlocke?**

Usually, you may only catch 1 Pokemon per area. It is the first Pokemon you encounter. If it faints or flees, you may **not** catch anything else from that area.

**At the beginning of a game, when you have no access to Poke Balls but must encounter a wild Pokemon to go on with the game, does the first Pokemon I encounter on a Route count as the only Pokemon I can catch?**

Most of the time, these Pokemon do not count. However, as soon as you have access to Pokeballs, it does count, and you may only catch the first Pokemon you see with access to Pokeballs.

**On some Routes, there is grass and water. Can I catch a Pokemon from both?**

Most of the time, no. But keep in mind it is your Nuzlocke, if you want to you can. If there is a pond in, say, a city, then you may, as the city would count as a different area.

**Does each floor of a cave count as a different area?**

Usually, no. If there is a Pokemon you want on a different floor of the cave, you will have to Repel your way to that floor and hope you get the Pokemon you want, if you haven't banned Repels (as some people do).

**Are forests and caves considered a part of the route they are on?**

Ususally, no.

**In the Safari Zone, do all 4 areas count as different areas, or is the Safari Zone just one giant area?**

In most Nuzlockes, you can catch a Pokemon in each area.

**Do gift Pokemon count as a catch for that area?**

Normally, no, however, I have seen a few people say yes.

**I don't have any Pokemon that can learn an HM needed to move on! Am I allowed to catch another Pokemon for this purpose?**

Yes, however, you may not use it in battle.

**What is the ""Dupes Clause?""**

The ""Dupes Clause"" is optional and says you can opt to or opt to not catch a Pokemon you have caught and try again, for a Pokemon you have not caught. You may try again until you encounter something you haven't caught. This rule is very variable- you can choose not to catch a Pokemon you have, you are NOT allowed to catch a Pokemon you already have, etc. Some people are able to try three times. If the first, second, and third Pokemon encountered are all duplicates of a previously caught Pokemon, the third Pokemon is the final Pokemon- you can either take it or leave it.

**What is the ""Shiny Clause?""**

The ""Shiny Clause"" says you are allowed to catch any shinies on a Route, whether they were the first Pokemon or not. Whether you use them or not is up to you.

**Am I allowed to have more than six Pokemon? Can I use the box?**

Of course! Unless you want to try Vitehite's ""Empty Box Mode.""

**Fainting Rules**

**What are the basic fainting rules in a Nuzlocke?**

If a Pokemon faints, it is dead. You must release or permabox it, or permanently box.

**Am I allowed to use Revives?**

Using a revive would be like bringing a Pokemon back to life, which is going against one of the main rules of a Nuzlocke. A Nuzlocke is supposed to make the game harder, and this could take away the challenge. If you want to, you can use them, but that wouldn't be considered a Nuzlocke.

**Do I have to release a Pokemon if it faints?**

No. You can also Permabox, or permanently box it.

**My whole team wiped out! What now?**

If you want, you can make a new team using any Pokemon in the box, or consider it ""Game Over"" and start again.

**Nicknaming Rules**

**What are the standard nicknaming rules of a Nuzlocke?**

You must nickname all your Pokemon, in order to have a larger bond with them and have it hurt more if they pass away.

**Do I have to follow this rule?**

No. This rule is very optional.

**I forgot to nickname a Pokemon!**

Go to the Name Rater as soon as he is available and change your Pokemon's name to that. If he is not available until later in the game, be sure to call it by a name until you can.

**Other**

**What is BlazeBlack/VoltWhite/SeaGreen/ScorchedEarth/Etc?**

These are hacks, usually intended to make the games harder or improve the typing, moveset, etc. of Pokemon the creator of the hack believes should be in the official games. These games are unofficial and can sometimes be messed up, freeze, etc.

**Okay, so where can I get on?**

I'm not good with hacks, but basically, you must download an emulator, a clean ROM of the game, and something else, like UnRARx or something? If you need help with a hack you would like to Nuzlocke, please **do not consult this FAQ** as you will probably end up exploding your computer.

**I caught a Haunter/Boldore/Graveler/Kadabra/etc, is it okay to give it to my friend to evolve it and have them give it back?**

Normally, yes. If you are on a ROM on your computer, it is also okay to hack it and make it so giving it an evolutionary stone/item/etc will evolve it.

**In Gen 5, can I ""Audino Grind?""**

I have never seen anyone *not* do this- Audinos are great to train on in Nuzlockes.

**How can I tell you about my Nuzlocke?**

There are plenty of ways to do this.

* A screenshot run- Take pictures on your ROM when someone dies, an NPC says something stupid, etc. Add plot to it or not, what ever. Good examples of these are [Tailes](http://s7.zetaboards.com/Nuzlocke_Forum/topic/8554659/1/) and [Haberdasher,](http://s7.zetaboards.com/Nuzlocke_Forum/topic/8538130/1/) to name a few of my favorites.

* A comic- show us your artistic skill! An amazing example of this is [Petty,](http://pettynuzlockelg.smackjeeves.com/) one of the most famous Nuzlockers of all time. 

* A written story- I don't have any good examples, because I'm not the biggest fan of them, but if you're an author, you can always try this.

* Just tell us! Not plot or screenshots, just tell us who passed away or who you've caught.

**Where should I grind in &lt;game&gt;?**

There have been many posts about this, please use the search bar.

**Am I allowed to breed Pokemon in the Day Care?**

Personally, I only breed once- it's a new area. It's your choice, though.",,False,self,t5_2setk,True,,,True,t3_le82u,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/le82u/nuzlocke_faqcheck_here_before_asking_a_question/,

Some of you guys know me, I've been working on /r/PokemonZetaOmicron for a month or two (a fangame for the Pokemon series). 

One of the interesting things I've added to this game to separate it from the others is a Nuzlocke Mode, which forces you into a Nuzlocke Challenge (to help you if you lose your nerve) (it won't actually delete your Pokemon, but it will stop items like revives from working, and Nurse Joy will refuse to heal your Pokemon if a fainted one is in your party).

However, I want an incentive for the average player to actually try out a Nuzlocke in the game. I thought I'd ask you guys: what kind of bonuses could a Nuzlocker use in a game? Nothing game-breaking, like boosted stats or legendary Pokemon, but something useful anyways.

I was recommended to come here, because I suspect you guys have plenty of these ideas due to your experience (I've never beaten the Elite 4 in a Nuzlocke myself :P)

A couple of suggestions I had were:

- Item forms of HMs, so you can make full use of your Pokemon's movesets

- New TMs, possibly OHKOs for different types(?), that can be purchased by a Nuzlocker

- A ""graveyard"" area with a grave with the names of fallen Pokemon on it

- ""Nuzlocke Balls"", essentially a heal ball with a higher catch rate, for those moments 

- If your entire party dies, and you ""lost"" the Nuzlocke, the nurse will inform you of this and you can continue the game outside of the ""Nuzlocke Mode"" and without the bonuses thereof

Just post below on some things you've used that's helpful, sayings, items, moves or whatever!


Tip Edits!

From ***Chipperz***: Grind. Grind grind grind.



From ***Derpynerd***: When you can, farm berries. They're a decent early game medicine source.

Remember the damage variation for an attack. The next one could be as much as 2.33 times stronger than the last hit, factoring crits.

Substitute blocks status in all but R/B/Y.

Crits were based off of speed in Gen I. If something's fast, expect it to Crit often.

From ***Pitchy***: always make sure you're stocked up on potions and antidotes. ALWAYS

from ***Didgeripoo***:  Moves like swords dance, nasty plot, cosmic power, work up, calm mind, acid armor are your friend. If you can get a mon in and set up around 3 of these, you have a good chance to sweep the battle.

Always have a back up. Think you can take Morty with your Crobat that knows bite, or your Umbreon that knows a dark type move? Good, having confidence is great, but have safety net that can let you get a heal in, or finish off that tricky opponent. Relying on one mon for a major battle can be the end of you.

from ***surferdudeX***: Always think: If they have any type of priority move, can it kill me? If yes, switch out or heal.

from ***Ehan2***: Don't underestimate the following TM moves:

Toxic = can be used to beat an opponent you wouldn't have a chance against otherwise

Light Screen/Reflect = absolute LIFESAVERS in a Nuzlocke, they'll make your more frail pokemon seem extra bulky

Rain Dance/Sunny Day/Sandstorm = Great for powering up water/fire moves and improving the defenses of your rock/ground/steel types respectively

and most importantly...

Attract! Absolutely saved me at the Elite Four when I had only 3 pokemon left. Put it on a female pokemon, as most enemy pokemon tend to be male (I don't know why). This will immobilize enemies and let you set up to sweep.

from ***More_Oboe***: Make sure you know your foe's movesets instead of just paying attention to basic typing. For example, MANY fighting types know Rock Slide...Zebstrika usually knows Flame Charge...things like that. I've lost too many because of a bad switch-in to an opponent I thought my Pokemon could handle.

Also, I would personally recommend having at least ONE Pokemon with an attack that can't miss. Chances are, you're going to run into a foe that's going to spam double team (cough Wallace's Ludicolo cough), and the last thing you want is to be stalled out because you can't land a hit.

Don't underestimate the opponent. Ever. Don't do it.

This was already kind of mentioned, but putting any status affliction on the opponent can be a lifesaver. On the flip side, always be prepared with Full Heals to cure your own.

(Pssst. Also, if you're playing R/S/E, the area around Mauville Town...I think it's routes 117 and 118...are fantastic for training once you get the PokeNav working. There are 7 Trainers you can re-battle, two of which are breeders, and they're all very close. It's made grinding ridiculously fast, even without the speed up button)

from ***maxpower2001***: I don't always abide by this rule, but: Try to make sure you have a type advantage against the opponent. Fighting with a Pokemon that is weak to your opponents just because that Pokemon is one level behind everyone else on your team can lead to death.

from ***JulianGiraffe***: Abilities are underestimated. I would highly recommend studying up on Gym Leader and Elite 4 teams. Especially on difficult hacks.

from ***WillFerguson***: Trainer battles are your best friend for learning your mon's ability in certain situations.

from ***ManOfEpic***: Never give up. It seems simple enough, but I've given up and now my departed ones lay forgotten on my PC

from ***Bunghole95***: goes without saying but be careful with your pokemons moves. i usually like to have a move that is super effective against itself i.e my charizard that knows rock slide can sweep any fire types if needed. can help in grinding when the wild pokemon are the same type as the one you are grinding

It also goes without saying to use a variety of pokemon even if you don't like them. remember that a nuzlocke makes you use pokemon that you would never use. i never liked the zubat line but i used one and now crobat is in my top 20 pokemon

also always assume that moves that hit multiple times such as double slap will hit the maximum number of times

from ***WilliamSchnell***: Never, ever underestimate an opponent's move just because it has low accuracy; even moves with 75% can still hit a surprising number of times. Even if you've used Sand-Attack or Smokescreen a billion times, be prepared.

On the flip side, it's not a good idea to pass up accuracy for power. Surf, for example, is more reliable than Hydro Pump.

Finally, if your opponent is low on HP, DON'T use a weaker move to conserve PP. You never know whether or not it will knock it out.

from ***DrawingDead0***: On pre-gym grinding: Usually, there is a trainer in gyms that has a single high-level Pokemon. If you can comfortably that that down, you're good to go. That Pokemon is usually close to the average level of the Leader's Pokemon (hacks excluded), and the Pokemon's sweeper should be a fun fight, but shouldn't destroy you. It'll be right in that sweet spot. This is especially helpful in blind nuzlockes.

ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS assume the next hit will be critical. You don't want to be caught by surprise.

Don't ever underestimate a potential catch. Rattata can be a monster with STAB Hyper Fang, Plusle/Minun are great as electric types and the Vanillite line grows up to be way boss, especially at the Dragon gym. In a Nuzlocke, we are beggars, and we can't be choosers.

Experience should only be a concern when grinding. When that gyarados is coming out, don't switch to Bellsprout because you think she needs to level up. Take no chances and use Magnemite. I've lost many a Pokemon because they needed to ""catch up"" to the others and I put them in a fight they couldn't win comfortably.

from ***HawkwardPlatypus***: Watch out for pokemon with the move pursuit (such as raticate) when switch grinding as this can be fatal to frail ghost and psychic types. Also pokemon with selfdestruct (such as koffing and geodude) can take down much higher level pokemon without much effort so when grinding against these try to use fast moves that can take them out in 1 hit.

from ***N7DKPIG***: Surprised this hasn't been mentioned: Don't give up or get discouraged if your starter or a favorite poke of yours is lost. It's never easy to watch your best friend go down before your eyes, often when you least expect it, but that shouldn't instantly put an end to your run. Keep pushing, get revenge, and fight on.

Also, in a similar vein, NEVER rely on just one or two strong Pokemon. You'll get careless, slip up, one of them will die, and you will cry. Trust me...

from ***KainTehDragon***: In HG/SS take the time to grind up at the Pokeathlon. They sell good items (evo stones) and there is no risk to your Pok√©mon! Before the you beat the Elite Four, it's pretty much the only way you can get some of the evo stones, unless that one picnicker happens to find you one (I've been on my current run of HG for 30 hours and she hasn't called me once).

Also, don't hesitate to leave some of your weaker Pok√©mon at the daycare to get some free xp. It beats tediously grinding them up if something bad happens to your main team later down the road.

from ***HoshieGirl21***: I don't know if this'll help but here are some things I follow.

Don't underestimate any Pokemon. While you play a regular Nuzlocke, you are able to catch any Pokemon. Make good use of any Pokemon you are able to catch. Even if they are known as generally weak Pokemon, you never know what you'll get in a Nuzlocke so you have to make do with what you get. It might end becoming one of the most useful assets for your team.

Also try and create as many move combos as possible such as Focus Energy and then using a move with a high critical hit ratio or Defense Curl and then Rollout.

from ***Reese_Ridley***: Remember that critical hits override stat changes. I once had three Iron Defenses up on my metagross in Black 2 and Ghetsis's Hydreigon killed me with a critical crunch ;_;

from ***Silverbits***: Using vending machines for cheaper healing items is underrated. 200p for a Fresh Water that heals 50hp, versus a Super Potion for 700p to heal the same amount? I don't mind tapping a button for a while to buy them since you can't just say give me 10 for the money savings.

If you ever get paired up with a partner that heals your team after each battle, GRIND FOR YOUR LIFE!

Be wary of common typed moves that are on Pokemon you wouldn't expect. Things like a lot of Pokemon knowing Bite (Dark type) can be costly when training up Psychic and Ghost type Pokemon.

Pay attention! Don't let your mind wander while training, or you will only have yourself to blame.

Have fun! We do this for entertainment, don't lose sight of that even if you have some serious losses.

from ***Ederek_Cole***: Give yourself benchmarks when grinding for each Gym, and reach that mark with each Pokemon before challenging the Gym. For instance, in SS I made sure everything in my party was Level 30 before I even attempted it, even though I only used one Pokemon in the Gym itself.

This does three important things for you. 1) It keeps you from getting discouraged by grinding. You have a clear goal to hit, which makes grinding less tedious. 2) It keeps you from being caught off guard. If I had only trained up a Dark-type for the Gym, and then the next trainer I fought was a high level Machoke or Machamp, then I would've lost my strongest Pokemon. Which brings us to 3) It keeps you from having a single ""strongest Pokemon"", which ties into what was said earlier about not relying on any one or two teammates.

from ***Keuhlenhake***: This is my personal motto, but if I EVER get a steel type, use it. Steel types have saved my ass more times than I can count in a nuzlocke",,False,self,t5_2setk,1364230131.0,,333,True,t3_1ay3pl,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1ay3pl/nuzlocke_tips_and_tricks_second_one/,

I noticed in the second battle with him that his Bayleef was a massive pain in the ass, and that my Pidgey didn't even scratch it. My now Pidgeotto didn't do much more this time against it. I lacked any other counter for it except my Croconaw with Ice Fang. It was risky, but my main way of damaging it. 

Its combination of poison powder followed by magical leaf left me with very few windows of attack without having to switch out into my Bellsprout which I used to sleep it then proceed to heal and switch back into Croconaw. With his aggravating use of Synthesis all the time I never really made much progress. After a while my Bellsprout was starting to drop in health. The fact that it was also poisoned did not help. 

With nothing that could fight it effectively except a poisoned Croconaw with red health I desperately looked at my party. I noticed my under leveled and neglected Butterfree of level 12. It had Sleep spore I recalled. Uncertain of it being able to tank magical leaf I open up its Bulbapedia page to check its resistances against grass. A large grin spread across my face when I noticed its double resistance to grass. Its low level still worried me, but I thought I could be able to tank it with at least half health. Boy was I wrong. My lovely Butterfree then proceeds to dodge every poison powder, and tank every magical leaf with well over 80-90 percent health left. I healed my Croconaw back to a healthy state and beat the fucking shit out of that grasscunt Bayleef.  

Marco the Butterfree now has an Honorary Position in my party, and will not be neglected after his heroic performance! 

Please! Go ahead and share your stories of unexpected heroism!

Currently, I am in Hearthome City with three badges, having just beat Fantina only a few minutes ago.

The only Pokemon to survive that fateful fight is my darling Shellos named Sansa (level 26 currently, quiet nature in case anyone was curious). She's all I have left, courtesy of a few rookie mistakes on my part and a few bullshit critical hits. 

I know the rival fight is right up ahead, and I know he has a Roselia on his team at this point in the game, which spells death for my last Pokemon. Sansa is only four levels away from evolving, but if anything that's even worse for her, as her weakness to Grass is doubled again with her secondary Ground-typing. 

I think I'm going to grind up to 29 (shouldn't be too difficult), and challenge my rival then. I don't really think I have a chance in hell at winning, honestly. I had a good run though; I got farther than I thought I would.

Humor me in my last moments and grant one request, my fellow Nuzlockers, and consider it my last. I won't ask you to remember me. I'm not a Trainer worth remembering. I made too many mistakes for that. 

Just remember Sansa, the Shellos who secretly only wanted to be a Contest Star, but life thrust her onto the battlefield.

I've never done any sort of web comic or anything, but I've always thought the idea would be neat.  I'm mildly artistic, and so I think I'm going to give this a go.  Part of my New Year's resolution was to output more creativity this year, and I think a web comic would be just the way to do it.

This is basically a sketchy, rough-draft, preview thing... I don't know.  An 'interest check,' I guess.  Who wouldn't want to read a comic about a 28 year old, hairy, tattooed smoker trying to make his way through Sinnoh?  New to reddit, newer to nuzlocke, but you all seem like a friendly bunch.  Hopefully I can get the first comic (basically what you're seeing here) out in a week or two, fully colored with text/plot and all.

His high special defense got me through many sticky situations. And how he's dead. :(

https://dl.dropbox.com/sh/opb8xcv4zrc8tgj/W2kamyY9el/Randomizers/B%3AW%20Randomizer.zip?dl=1

It is a randomizer ""patch"" that you run on a rom and it can randomize near everything, starters, random encounters, and on some roms even trainers.  It works like a charm, with the one small exception being in B/W, the original starters show up, but when you actually confirm, it gives you your random starter.

Example:
I chose a picture of Tepig, and right after it says ""Noire received Mienfoo!""

So all you have to do is use save states to check each starter and you're good to go.  It randomizes everything including fishing and surfing, and I've had no issues with it.  Although I notoriously fish up Dialgas...like 70% of the time.

Anyway, I just like this option as I'm a fan of more variety and 1-694 is a pretty sweet deal imo.

Next up is kingdra and after a long fight and two full restores I was all out of options. All pokemon except Blaze are low yellow and Rocky has fainted :(. Tails is on the field and after taking a Hydro Pump it is on 2hp and Kingdra is still on green health. Figuring that a switch would just kill a different pokemon I stay in with Tails and use thunder hoping to make it easier on my other Pokemon and not black out.

This is where the magic happens.

I've found the rule fun because it forces me to constantly update the move-sets of my team.

But as the comics flow in, I think it's important that we establish a few rules to make sure the subreddit is easy to read and navigate (thanks for the idea christophski).

From now on, if you wish to submit a Nuzlocke comic, please follow this simple(ish) template in your title:

¬¶

**[***name***]**'s **[***pokemon version***]** Nuzlocke: Part **[***number***]** 

¬¶

So, if I started a Sapphire Nuzlocke, my first comic would be called **Quantumsheep's Sapphire Nuzlocke: Part 1**. My next one would be **Quantumsheep's Sapphire Nuzlocke: Part 2** and so on. 

The community will become familiar with the name's of the redditors submitting their favourite comics, and can find the latest updates easily. 

I hope that makes sense to everyone. Enjoy r/nuzlocke.

1356141484.0,23,self.nuzlocke,159dgs,Pokemon 3rd Gen Reasonable Randomizer (x-post from r/PokemonROMhacks),LAT10S,24,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/159dgs/pokemon_3rd_gen_reasonable_randomizer_xpost_from/,"Hello r/Nuzlocke,

The [Reasonable Randomizer](http://code.google.com/p/pokemon-reasonable-randomizer/downloads/list) is a Java program that can modify the starter pokemon, wild pokemon, trainer pokemon and movesets of any pokemon game from the 3rd gen. It works with FireRed, LeafGreen, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire, and with English, Japanese and French ROMs. The Reasonable Randomizer is different from other randomization programs in that it offers options for limited randomization, which means it won't simply pick any random pokemon from Bulbasaur to Deoxys, but instead limits the random pokemon to choose from based on factors such as evolution state, pokemon strength, pokemon habitat, and type specialties.

I've hosted the program on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pokemon-reasonable-randomizer). I've also included the Java source code with the program, if anybody is interested in seeing it. [Here](http://i1196.photobucket.com/albums/aa401/Impiety0/UI_zps14106ba7.png) is a sneak peak at the user interface, for a visual explanation of what it does.

#Randomizer Features:

+  **Unevolved starters** - You have the option to make randomized starters unevolved. 

+  **Limit wild pokemon randomization based on strength** - this makes it so that every wild pokemon that is replaced has roughly the same strength as the pokemon that is replacing it. This means that it will be very unlikely to find pokemon like Groudon in Route 101 and pokemon like Weedle in Cerulean Cave.

+  **Limit wild pokemon randomization based on habitat** - this causes the randomizer to replace wild pokemon with pokemon that have the same habitat. Selecting this option means that you won't find, say, wild Blaziken while fishing, or wild Horsea in the middle of a cave. 

+  **Limit Trainer pokemon randomization based on strength** - this causes every trainer pokemon that is replaced to have roughly the same strength as the pokemon that is replacing it. It means that Youngster Joey won't end up with, say, a Ho-Oh, while Lance doesn't get pokemon like Rattata.

+  **Trainers retain type specialties** - choosing this option will cause type specialist trainers to only recieve pokemon that match their type specialty. For instance, Misty only gets Water pokemon, while Bug Catcher Holden only gets Bug pokemon. 

+  **Rival retains pokemon** - the rival's last pokemon will be kept constant throughout the game, except for when it evolves. 

+  **Rematch trainers retain their pokemon** - trainers that can rematch will keep the pokemon they originally used. The program keeps track of the evolutions as well, and can add new pokemon to the trainer's party.

+  **Trainer pokemon get randomized movesets** - the reasonable randomizer program doesn't pick completely random moves; it cobbles together random movesets from the pokemon's naturally learned moves, TM moves, egg moves, and tutor moves. You also have the option to use advanced movesets, which are predefined movesets that are strategically coherent. I basically used Battle Factory movesets for the advanced movesets, as well as Smogon for legendary pokemon.

UPDATE - Release version 1.1 of the randomizer.

So I was wicked excited when I got to her today, totally prepared to face her. Everyone was ready, I had a game plan, and I was going to own her. 

I led with Riddick the Ampharos, who destroyed Gyarados with a well placed Discharge, only 40 HP worse for wear. Mal the Red Gyarados destroyed her two Dragonairs, dipping down to yellow health but otherwise in good condition. Now its my six vs Kingdra.

First up is Fender the Alakazam. Choice Specs Psychic.... leaves Kingdra with 1HP, followed by Sitrus Berry. Critical hit Hydro Pump takes my special powerhouse from me. Riddick comes back in to finish the job. Discharge again leaves the Kingdra with 1HP, and a Hydro Pump silences him forever too. In comes Larz, my trusty Feraligatr. I go for Ice Fang as Clair Full Restores. I miss. Dragon Pulse. Ice Fang... misses again... Larz goes down to another Dragon Pulse. In comes Catie the Nidoqueen, who Body Slams the Kindgra on a Hydro Pump miss and gets the paralysis. A shadow Claw brings the Kindgra down to yellow as Catie dies to a Hydro Pump. In comes Avery, the Rattata-turned-Raticate who was not in the top percent. Yet, here he stands, in his eigth Gym Battle, standing atop the bodies of his fallen team with no fear in his eyes. Hyper Fang! Kingdra uses Hyper Beam. This is is, Avery. I watch his health go down, down, down, and he SURVIVES with 31 HP. Two more Hyper Fangs and Kingdra finally goes down.

So here I am, with a Raticate and a Gyarados, about to grind for the Elite Four. This is gonna suck.",,False,self,t5_2setk,False,,,True,t3_wuu8e,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/wuu8e/soooo_clair_sucks/,

One of my first catches was a Marill named Daniel. At first, he was a lackluster member of the team but he eventually blossomed into SO much more. He confidently led my team into any situation, rolling out some devastating hits onto the enemy team. I thought he was unstoppable. Then came Wiona.

Daniel led the team that day. I sent him out of his Pokeball and he bounced around, ready to fight as usual. Following a single spoken command, he condensed his body into a sphere and started slamming into her Pokemon. He went second, but it didn't matter for her first Pokemon, as its attack little damage. As she sent out her Swablu, a smirk crept onto my face. What could this tiny bird do? I would soon find out.

Wiona drew a line across her throat with her finger, and her Swablu let out the most cursed of all melodies a bird could sing. Daniel and I recoiled in pain, and though I regained my composure, I noted that a malevolent purple aura surrounded Daniel now. He took down the Swablu in one hit, then immediately became more pale. He then took down her Pelipper in one as well. With her Altaria, however, he would not be so lucky. An almost full-powered Rollout left it with a slimmer of health. After that, the malevolent aura choking him now, he stumbled around for a few seconds before finally falling down and dying a bloodless death. I cried as I sent out my Swampert to punish the pesky Altaria with an Ice Beam.

One quick note, you must have a cheat that allows you to catch trainer pokemon.
1. Once a pokemon has fainted, it's dead (DUH!)
2. You may only catch trainer pokemon.
        -there are no restrictions as to how many you can catch.
        -you may not catch gym leader, elite 4, rival, or other important trainer's pokemon
3. You must nickname your pokemon
        -the names must be mean or insulting in some way.
4. After obtaining your 1st trainer caught pokemon, you must release your starter(never said this was emotionally easy)
5. You must defeat any important battle(gym, rival) the 1st time. For everytime you lose, you must release the last pokemon you used.
         -this does not apply to elite 4

I hope you will try this out and let me know of anyway I might be able to improve this. I plan to try it and get it up here asap.

First of all, Brawly can't even damage a Sableye in Emerald. In Sapphire he has only Knock Off, which deals barely any damage. So it's essentially a freecard for his gym. And Norman, who I hear a lot of people get wrecked by, can only hit you with Faint Attack.

1363014702.0,18,self.nuzlocke,1a32by,I just had a heart stopping experience in my Diamond run.  I have to share my story.,MaiLittIePwny,20,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1a32by/i_just_had_a_heart_stopping_experience_in_my/,"So I'll begin in Solaceon Town (The one with the daycare).  I've named all my Pokemon after Ottawa Senators, the hockey club.

Still reeling from the unfortunately quick death of Neil (Stunky), I decide I'm ready for Sinnoh's rainy route 215.  My team consists of Alfredsson (Monferno), Silfvrberg (Buizel), Zibanejad (Vespiquen), Latendress (Bibarel the HM Slave), and the egg from Hearthome City.

I get into route 210, and catch my new ~~best friend~~ dust collector, Greening the Kriketune.  Boxed.  I clear out the trainers, and move on to route 215.  I catch Bishop the Ponyta, and heal up.  *I'm in it for the long haul.*

I wipe almost everything out on the route with Zibanejad, because Vespiquen is hilarious.  It was slightly underlevelled to begin with, so it seemed like a good idea.  I had no clue.  I'm grinding through, and am down to 3 Moomoo Milks and 1 Hyper Potion I found.  Last set of trainers are in sight, so I heal up and dive right in after using a pair of milks.  Double Battle.

Zbad and Alfie are first up, vs a Glameow and Monferno.  Mach Punch demolished Glameow, and Power Gem, through the power of a critical hit, wipes the floor with Dennis' inferior Monferno.  Round 2.  Fight.

One sends out a Gyarados, and the other sends a Kadabra.  *FUCK.*  Vespiquen needs some health, so I Heal Order.  I Flame Wheel on Kadabra, and it *misses.*  Uh oh.  Confusion lands on Monferno, bringing it from 100% to a sliver of health (5 hp).  Gyarados uses Bite on ZBad, and Vespiquen takes it like a boss.  I got lucky.  Very lucky.

I get Alfredsson the hell out of there, and decide my only other option is Silfvrberg, the Buizel.  I know it's risky, because I love that thing, but I can't afford to let Monferno die.  I send it out and Power Gem Kadabra.  Somewhere around 30% of Kadabra's HP is drained, and it uses Confusion in retaliation.  Couldn't be any more than 20% damage.  Unfortunately, Gyarados used Thrash, and brought Buizel from 100% to the red (3 hp).  I'm shitting my pants.  I can't take this kind of abuse any more, if they decide to attack the same Pokemon, I'm flat out dead.

Moomoo Milk heals Silfvrberg on Zbad's turn, and Silf's Aqua Jet slams into Kadabra.  It's in the red.  I need to survive just one more turn.  Kadabra attacks Vespiquen (whew), and Thrash takes Buizel back to the brink of death.  Repeat the process, but with my last potion; Kadabra is dead, and Gyarados is confused.

Buizel is full HP, Vespiquen is less than half, but they both attack.  I know I need to do some damage to this Gyarados.  I hope for confusion, but get no such luck.  It hits Buizel with a Bite and brings it below half.  We're pounding away on this stupid Gyarados, and it Thrashes on Vespiquen.  6 hp.  My heart stopped.  I thought it was over.

On that turn, Gyarados fell, and I had a hefty serving of humble pie.  I almost got KO'd about 6 times in there.  One crit would have ended my entire run.

Be safe out there guys.  You never know what kind of monsters you'll run into.",,False,self,t5_2setk,False,,e,True,t3_1a32by,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1a32by/i_just_had_a_heart_stopping_experience_in_my/,

Only one task remained - defeat Red atop Mount Silver and claim the title of true champion for myself.
Tragedy struck when during training, Azul was taken by a critical hit from one of the Elite Four's pokemon as I trained for my fight with Red.
I was so disheartened that I quit. I moved on to other Pokemon games, other teams, accpeting my defeat.
Fast forward to today. I found my copy of Soul Silver in my desk drawer and remembered Whiskers and Carnivore. Maybe I could forget the journey, but they could not. I got back in the game. I grinded those two all the way up to level 90.
Determined, I scaled Mt. Silver on my massive Gyarados in no time at all. I faced Red there on that snowy slope and with my two Pokemon, crushed his entire team. Finally, after so long, victory is mine!

Things have been kinda rough. I'm right before the 8th gym and I've lost 6 Pokemon before, 4 of which, I planned on having in my final party (Benzy the Roggenrola lvl 17, Ariadne the Munna lvl 24, Olive the Tranquill lvl 31, and Tempus the Sawsbuck lvl 34). 
My team had some holes to fill, and since I was about to face the dragon gym, I figured that I'll put Jack the Vanillite in my party. I hadn't touched Jack since I caught him, just left him in the PC to sit. So I put the lvl 20 in my party, and I grind. I grind like nobody's business. I grinded like a dirty whore at senior prom and got him to lvl 44. And these babies aren't easy to train. He had more experience at 44 than Katano the Samurott has at 48 - by about 20000. Anyway, I get him to 44, and knowing that he evolves at 49, I decide to start working my way through the gym and then get him to 49 before the gym leader.
Jack was a little dragon slayer. OHKOs everywhere. I was proud of Jack. And then, it happened. A Druddigon comes up to the plate, and I used Ice Beam thinking I've got it in the bag, but the Druddigon stays alive, just barely. I start to panic, he's not supposed to be alive still. And then, Druddigon used Revenge. Super-effective, double-powered Revenge. I wanted to quit. I wanted to revive Jack anyway. But I kept my promise that I would not cheat. All that time, effort... gone, wasted.
RIP [Jack the Vanillish] (http://i.imgur.com/ue3BQ.jpg) at lvl 45

For my starter, I was extremely lucky to have Flygon as an option.  I chose her as my first companion, so logically she had to be named Rose.  Shortly after, we caught a Tyrogue named Mickey.  The two were inseparable.  Those two alone defeated over half the gyms.  As we went along, we caught other Pok√©mon to join our party.  Several were lost; most notably Wilfred the Diglett and Ianto the Spheal, falling to Wattson and Liza and Tate respectively.  The worst loss, however, was yet to come.

I was entering Victory Road.  I'd done this before, so when Wally approached, I was ready.  He led off with Altaria.  I led off with Mickey, now a Hitmonchan.  Despite Altaria's typing advantage, Mickey's ice punch made short work of Wally's Altaria. Wally's next pok√©mon was his Gardevoir.  I wasn't surprised, knowing Gardevoir had a huge type advantage against Mickey. I pulled Mickey out, sending out Rose.  Rose's crunch would easily put down Gardevoir in just two hits.  As I switched, Gardevoir used a Future Sight attack.  Following this, Rose used crunch, while Gardevoir used psychic.  In the second turn, I told Rose to use crunch again.  However, Gardevoir being the faster pokemon, unleashed psychic first.  It was a critical hit.  I watched as Rose's hp dropped, fearing.  But I breathed a sigh of relief as it stopped with 10 hp remaining.  Rose's second crunch finished off Gardevoir.  But then Future Sight hit.  

It was the worst way I could imagine her going.  She battled like a leaf on the wind, coming down battered but successful, only to take an unsuspecting killing shot.

So I was thinking I'd run an egglocke, but no... I need something better. So I figured what about a monotyped egglocke? Mmk, we're getting somewhere... now let's make that egglocke RANDOMIZED.

Allright, I think we have a thing here ladies and gentlemen.

--------------------------------------

Here are the rules and regulations:

* The Game we'll be using is Soul Silver

* I'll be using an RNG to choose my random type

* To qualify as a usable pokemon it's final evolution *must* contain ___ as its primary type.

* I'll use another RNG to select my starter from a list of applicable pokemon.

* Each route I will attempt to catch the first pokemon I see. If successful I will then trade that pokemon for an egg in my box. If I fail, I must wait for the next route before grabbing a new egg.

* No legendaries

* I may only carry 10 of any item at any given time, ever. This is to represent the limited backpack space.

* The backpack cannot have more than 50 items total

* Pokemon Centers are fair game. 

* Gift pokemon will be traded for eggs.

* All pokes will be nicknamed

* Faints will result in releasing.",,False,self,t5_2setk,1369199643.0,,,True,t3_1ete5x,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1ete5x/any_interest_in_a_monotyped_randomizer_egglocke/,

Basic rules, shinies and dupes clause. First caught pokemon was Pippin the Hoppip, I boxed it almost immediately as I had my Devin the Chikorita. After that I caught Juular the Gastly and Joseph the Geodude. Those three made the first two gyms basically walk-throughs. 

Everything seemed to go well, I was catching more pokemon and leveling up the ones I wanted for my team. First dead Pokemon was a lowlevel Bellsprout, which I used as Cut slave.  Then all started going downhill. Forgot my Gastly's other type, poison, and took a Magnitude 8 from a Trainer's Diglett straight on. During furious grinding for the tough third gym I lost a Wooper named Willie.

After leveling up my team around 20 I felt ready. I had a battle plan for the Miltank all thought out. I was going to use Reflect with Devin, then go for the kill with Joseph. I was hoping Rollout would be greatly weakened by both the Reflect and Joseph's rock type. I was wrong.

 I lost three pokemon to the ravaging Miltank, and the last one in my team, a freshly caught Pidgey named Heather, had 3 hp left. And Whitney thinks I'm mean...

EDIT: Trying to make this work. Withdrew two pokemon from the pc, Oskar the Geodude and Erin the Rattata. Caught Oskar in case my first Geodude got swiped, should have knocked some wood back there. The worst thing right now is I have no-one who could use Cut. So if I can't catch a pokemon who can, I'll have to forfeit and start over :P

EDIT2: Had my new team set up, with Oskar the Geodude, Pippin the Hoppip, Erin the Rattata, Hedwig the Hoothoot, Heather the Pidgey and Marion the Pinsir and who do I stroll into in Burned Tower? That's right Geralt Motherf**king Rival. Totally not ready for this I fear the worst. He starts with a Haunter, Erin changes to Oskar who's going to ram that Haunter to the ground with some seismic action. 

Lick, Magnitude .... 4. Well that didn't work. AGAIN.

At this moment I was feeling faintheaded. Not knowing what was up against was terrifying. So was the next move.

Curse. 

I hoped I could kill his pants with the next magnitude and change. Sure enough, magnitude 8 faints Haunter. The terror in his plans finally reveals itself when he changes into Quilava. I had no-one else to take on that Fire-type, so I healed and started throwing magnitude's here and there. A crit later I was way past quarter health. Quilava had just a hint of red left after my last magnitude. R.I.P Oskar, lvl 6-19. The worst was thinking how greatly Oskar would have done against the Magnemite and Zubat...

My team was Pagliacci, an Infernape; Balaclava, a Crobat; Zuzu, my late replacement Raichu (taking the place of my recently deceased and much loved Staraptor); Echarpe, a Floatzel; Marcellus, an Espeon; and Carni-Kiss, a Gengar. 
As a side note, I've never had a Gengar before despite being one I've always wanted (no one around who plays Pokemon to trade, forever alone ololol, etc.). When I saw the wild Ghastly as my catch for the route, I was excited, knowing I was moving and one of my friends at my new house played. I could have my Gengar.
The Elite Four went down fairly easily except for Aaron (Echarpe used Surf and bashed through Bertha and Flint, Carni-Kiss took down Lucian) due to most of his bugs knowing flying moves, which ruled out my Infernape and put the burden on my Crobat for the most part.
I had heard rumblings of Cynthia from my friend for a while now, but I didn't want to spoil the surprise and so didn't look up what she used. She opened with her Spiritomb, which went down with two Shadow Balls from Carni-Kiss, but was left with low health. She followed with Lucario, so I sent Balaclava out. After a Fly (a poor move, not knowing that Lucario knew Stone Edge), I pulled Balaclava back and sent Pagliacci out to finish the job. 
Next came Togekiss, which was quickly dispatched with two Thunderbolts from Zuzu. I was nervous when she sent out Milotic next. I knew I would probably only have one shot, and had to decide between the sure Thunderbolt, or the risky Thunder. In the end, I decided on Thunder and was lucky enough to get a critical hit, one shotting it (I later learned that her Milotic has Mirror Coat, which would have been awful if it had gone off).
Roserade. Seriously, Cynthia? Pagliacci uses Flame Wheel, Roserade goes down. 
So it had come to this. She sent out Garchomp, and the floor dropped out from under me. Dragon/Ground? That easily dispatches Pagliacci, Zuzu, and my others wouldn't have lasted long against Cynthia's signature Pokemon. I had to make the difficult decision.
I sent out Carni-Kiss, weak and battered with only 34 health, and hoped to go first. I used Destiny Bond, and I said goodbye to my first, and last, Gengar as I got hit by a Flamethrower, finishing us both off and securing the victory for her brethren.

This kickass little guy, names Floyd, soon became my best friend. Together we rolled through the first two cities pretty easily due to his Water/Flying type. Mauville was a stretch, and Floyd, now a Pelliper, was left at 4 hp, paralyzed, facing a full hp Manectric, with no Pokemon left. If I used a super potion, Manectric would wipe Floyd out with Thunder, which almost happened a few seconds earlier. With one final hope, I use ice beam (not very effective, but even though it's 1/2 damage it was still the strongest move). Critical hit. Battle over. From then on, I made sure Floyd was 20 levels higher than everyone. His moveset was Shock Wave, Ice Beam, Surf, and Wing Attack. He swept through almost everyone he faced. I admittedly neglected the rest of my team for Floyd, who I shared a bond with. There was no question that Floyd would end up on my Elite Four battling team. We rolled through the 4th, 5th, and 6th gyms, with no problems. Floyd, now over level 50 should of had no problems fighting anyone. Until...
Fresh off of getting our 6th badge, I was cocky. I didn't need to worry about types, because who  could possibly take out lv. 51 Floyd? I figured I would roll all the way to Lillicove. 
Double battle.
Manectric.
Thunder.
I thought his hp would stop falling. I had no reason to believe it would take out more than half of his health.
His health that was falling.
And falling.
Over. All over. 
In an instant, Floyd fell. I scratched out a win in the battle with a level 28 Swalot, named Gloop, and a level 21 Sandshrew, Slasher. They are the highest level members of my team. 
Time to return to the caves, and train. To rally around what's left, rebuild, and never forget those lost.
Never forget Floyd :/.

I loved reading the Nuzlocke comic, and am a fan of Pokemon, as far as the creatures and whatnot go. However, I have almost never sat through an entire Pokemon game, and figured if I'm gonna go for it, I'm gonna go big!

I decided on Emerald, since I've only played Yellow and Crystal, figured I may as well keep the 3rd chain going. I picked up my Torchic, lovingly named Kaizen, and went on my way.

First catch was a Wurmple, who I named Nibbles, followed by a Zigzagoon named Ruffles. I leveled them just fine and caught a Poochyena, named Scruffy.

Scruffy was USELESS.

We go past Briney's shack and start fighting a green-dressed girl. All she had was a level 7 Zigzagoon, no big woop. Ruffles kept pounding away at it, whittling it down, while all the enemy did was growl and tail whip.

Suddenly, Critical Hit. Ruffles has fainted.

Out of rage, I made Kaizen torches the shit out of it. From that point on, I decided to make sure my Pokemon are at least 1.5x the level that my opponents are.

Smooth sailing until Rustboro. Been having no luck catching anything, stupid Abra. I go into the gym, and my Dustox handily takes care of the three trainers.

When I got to the leader, it was a massacre.

I had no idea she would have such high levels. I ran in full gusto, right into a slaughter.

No one survived. No one.

Especially Scruffy.

Round 2, here I come. This time, hopefully, I can make it past Gym #1.",,False,self,t5_2setk,False,,,True,t3_pi4x9,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/pi4x9/a_nuzlocke_according_to_someone_who_rarely_plays/,

I was grinding up my buddies A LOT after my first loss (Sofia, the Starly).  I didn't want to lose any of my team (again).  However, just today I was thinking, ""I plan on making a comic about all this, and it's not going to have any exciting bits if there's never any sense of danger!""  It appears I didn't have to worry about that.  I waltzed through the second gym, and breezed through that Team Galactic building... until I got to the top.

Jupiter has only two pokemon.  I figure, ""Easy!""  My Turtwig, Tyrone, is pretty beat up, but it's okay.  He can sit this fight out.  There's five others that can handle this chick.  I send out Olivia the Onix to deal with her Zubat.  I'd been OHKOing zubats like crazy with Rock Throw.  Jupiter's Zubat uses Giga Drain.

Olivia dies.  Olivia, the fucking ONIX.  THE UNSTOPPABLE ROCK MONSTER IS FUCKING DEAD.  Peter Ponyta, get your ass out there and avenge her death!

Peter Flame Wheels that asshat into oblivion, and then the real beast comes out to play... SKUNTANK.  Peter gets pretty beat up, so I pull him out and send in Suzette the Staravia.  The first pokemon I ever caught after being given Tyrone the Turtwig.

Night Slash crits.  Suzette is dead.  This can't be happening.  Please, God, no.  I can't have lost her.  Not my Suzy.  Not my Suzy.

Bilbo Bibarel, you're up.  You were the next friend I ever made, right after Suzette.  I raised you up from just a goofy little Bidoof.  Avenge your sister.  Night Slash OHKO.  Bilbo dies.  I feel sick.  My chest is tight.  My stomach is turning.

My family is dying and I can't stop it... and it's my fault.

I'm not thinking clearly.  I don't know what to do.  Peter and Tyrone are both injured, and I can't lose either of them.  I CAN'T.  I send out the only other pokemon I have with me, Phyllis the Psyduck. Another OHKO.  Phyllis is dead.  I'm numb.  I can't believe what's happening.

Peter is too hurt.  Tyrone, it's up to you.  He goes in and instantly takes a hit taking him down into the red.  I heal him up, and the rest of the fight is an agonizing back an forth of Skuntank ripping Tyrone apart while he chugs potions and gets in the occasional, barely-effective Razor Leaf.

Tyrone finally, thankfully, defeats the Skuntank, but it doesn't feel anything like a victory.

Olivia, Suzette, Bilbo, and Phyllis are survived by Tyrone and Peter, and we will carry on in their memories.",,False,self,t5_2setk,False,,,True,t3_1d2851,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1d2851/jupiter_just_broke_my_heart_four_times_platinum/,

I  just beat the E4 with my relatively under-leveled (shame on me) party and lost some really good friends but found a new appreciation for my Noctowl Velma. With a pretty strong SpeDef stat, she was able to take a lot of the beatings that otherwise would have felled lesser pokemon throughout the course of the game. Her access to Psychic moves, and my crude SpeAtt EV training,  allowed her to sweep two E4 members alone and her early-game Normal typing + access to Psychic moves made her my go-to against any and all Ghost types.

As an aside, I understand that it is in the nature of a nuzlocke run to bond and depend upon pokemon that you normally would never do so, but are there any members of your current or past teams that really stood out amongst the rest? More specifically are there pokemon that, due to pre-nuzlocke biases, you came to depend upon due to their movepool, stats, typings, game environment, etc.?",,False,self,t5_2setk,False,,y,True,t3_1anyih,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1anyih/unexpectedly_reliable_pokes/,

Simply put, I've hit a rough patch since the beginning of February. As soon as I moved into a new apartment, my job decided to cut our department's budget, and they dropped my hours and pay by about 50%.

Since then, I've had to get a second job, and it's filled up the rest of my time and energy. On the longer days, I get up at 4am and get home by 8pm. It's not easy, and it leaves little time for the Nuzlocke since it's on an emulator on my computer.

Hopefully, in the next couple of weeks, things will be easier to balance and I'll be able to get back to Skadi and all of our favorite characters.

Sorry for the wait, and sorry for the wall of text.

1. ""Normal"" nuzlocke rules apply: only allowed to catch first sighting per route, faint=death, nicknames compulsory, Battle style=set.

2. Once a Pokemon is caught and put into the team, it is a **locked in** squad member until death.

3. A cap is set before the start on the number of ""reserves"" can be kept in the PC. Reserves can be caught under regular rules at any point, and can be promoted into the squad in place of a dead teammate but not a live one. if the number of reserves exceeds the cap, reserves must be discarded

4. (optional) Each time a gym is defeated, you can have one ""freebie""- you may switch one live squad member with a reserve. This must be used before leaving the city in which the gym, this is set to avoid stacking them or gambling on new captures. The switch is **permanent** unless another freebie is used to switch back or the switched in teammate dies.

**And that is just about it, and also where you guys come in. I would like to know what you think of this rule, what version you would like to see me play and also suggest a naming theme. I will select my favorites for version/names out of the chat, but it has to be something i can run on an emulator. Thanks all!**

There have been a lot of threads lately about where to find ROMs, where to get randomisers, how to make your VBA/Emulators work, etc.

While all of this may help with the enjoyment of your gaming experience, it is not specifically relevant to this subreddit. 

If you have any issues with emulators/ROMs/randomisers, I'm afraid you will have to do a Google search, or perhaps check out /r/PokemonROMhacks for more information. Threads of this nature will be removed in future.

Thanks for your cooperation.

The idea is I'm gonna do a Nuzlocke run of a gen 3 or below Pokemon game. I can only do gen 3 or lower because those are the only ones that I can emulate on my laptop due to hardware restrictions.

Rules: Nothing too extreme. I'll be able to use items and visit pokemon centers. If a pokemon faints, release it or perma-box it.

The interesting twist though, is I let /r/nuzlocke  decide my starter, and which pokemon I can catch in each route. Instead of catching the first one that I encounter, I go online and look up which pokemon appear in that area, and poll Reddit. Which ever pokemon from that area gets the most votes is the pokemon that I have to catch.

I can play any of the pre-ds pokemon games, but I'd rather not play gen 1 or any of the hacked roms.

So....whaddaya think?

EDIT: I also plan on taking and uploading screenshots for important events, like additions/losses to the team, gym victories, etc.

EDIT: Vote for which game!

I don't know why it's doing this, but you have to turn off safe mode to view the poll, but I assure you it's just a poll to choose which game I'll play: http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/569747

EDIT: Okay, for a while there Silver and Crystal were tied, but Silver finally pulled ahead, so I'll be playing Silver. Now it's time to pick my starter :D

http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/569764

EDIT: Holy shit! Out of nowhere, Totodile went from have zero votes, to the majority, with 17 votes (60%)!

I guess I'm playing Totodile :D

Ready to pick the pokemon I'll pick up on the first route when I have pokeballs?

http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/569773

EDIT: Vote for the pokemon I'll get from route 30!

http://www.misterpoll.com/polls/569791


BIG EDIT: Okay, so for Route 29 Sentret and Rattata tied, so I'll catch which ever appears first.

On route 30, it looks like I'm catching a Kakuna (Thanks, thanks a lot).

Story - Heartgold Nuz. At Bugsy I have a no-turning-back rule where once I start the gym, I can't heal in the middle, and came in underprepared with too few potions. I also have a three-on-three rule, or two-on-two or whatever with Gym Leaders. My team, Tala the Sentret, Flex the OP Geodude and Seth the Slowpoke, new to the team and underleveled.

Seth is out first. My strategy: set up on the Metapod and Kakuna with curse, then see if I can't fuck up the Scyther with my uber-buffed Attack and Defense.

I did not see U-Turn coming.

Scyther out first, and I panic. I'm like fine, bitch, we'll play it that way - Go Flex. U-Turn does substantial damage, but I'm alive. No worries. I potion up. Now I'm down to a measly Super Potion, but I figure it all works the same. I spam Defense Curl like my life depends on it while the Metapod tackles me, barely scratching me. I max out defense and rock throw, and down goes Metapod.

In comes Scyther, again. I'm thinking, ""It's cool. Higher level, higher defense, outrageous stat buffs and a double type advantage - I'M COOL, RIGHT?! Wrong. U-turn again, CRITICAL. AT THIS TIME OF ALL TIMES. Double damage. Ignored stat modifiers. Dead. My beloved Geodude, dead.

Now I'm panicking. Tala and Seth have a long, hard-fought battle with that GODDAMN Kakuna and his Poison. I had to use my final Super Potion to beat him and THREE FUCKING ANTIDOTES. Then comes the Scyther. Two U-turns and I'm swept. Done. Three of my best, gone.

Thankfully, I didn't bring Razor, my Bayleef into the battle. I still have a Zubat, a Bellsprout, a Rattata and the Togepi at my disposal. No available catches though. I'm going to train the Rattata, Zubat and Togtic. No way am I going to risk my Bayleef to this bastard.

I have to now take a long walk to clear my head. I am actually *sad* about losing these bros. Hasn't happened to me in a long while, but here's the weird part: I'm glad I'm sad. It's what Nuzlocke is all about, right? Tala was my first catch, and without her, we wouldn't have beaten Falkner. Flex is a boss that has never been in the red until Bugsy's accursed Scyther. And Seth was new, but I love Slowbro, and I was so excited to have one. I'll miss them dearly and fight on. I can't wait for the fuckers to see the power of Supersonic, double resistance to Bug and STAB Hyper Fang.

**TL;DR Swept by Bugsy due to horribly timed crits and poor planning. Actually emotionally affected by it, and kind of happy to be in touch with the essence of the Nuzlocke. Now I'm grinding for revenge. And it will be sweet.**

I wish I had thought to use a cheri berry or paralyze heal before my attack... Scar, I will use your death as a way to learn to anticipate critical hits in any situation, and become stronger for it.

I could've been walking in there with my Braviary poisoned, not an antidote in sight. 

Maybe it was my lack of sleep. Maybe it was the fact that I was on a bus for 9 hours with nothing to do. Maybe I just wanted him to die. I don't know exactly why I did this, but I went to the Pok√©mon league with 5 good members, and one under-leveled Braviary, Richard.

I had already swept through the first four opponents, and after several full restores, I was under the impression that I was ready. I used Dr. Craw (Bisharp) for almost everyone, and my Mushii (Musharna) for everyone else.

Before I talk about Alder, lemme fill you in on this rule I had. Ever since I picked one up, I kept one max revive on me, as a backup. I would only use it when I reeeealllyyyy needed it. I already let several others die, deeming them unimportant enough for the max revive. It was my one and only second chance.

I walk in, up the stairs, and we talk a bit and the battle starts. Accelgor was the first one, I used Zyzyx (Chandelure) for fire, and got Accelgor and Escavalier out of the way real quick. 

Druddigon got a critical hit and took out Zyzyx in one hit with Night Slash. I was devastated. I called out Thing (Throh) and smashed him thoroughly. 

Bouffalant got a tiny hit on Thing while I used my max revive on Zyzyx, and Bouffalant was gone, after scratching Thing. I called out Zyzyx yet again for Vanilluxe for a OHKO, and that's when I was informed that Volcarona was my obstacle between Victory and I. I was forced to call out Richard for the first time. 

Volcarona used a Quiver Dance, and I used Air Slash. I was super effective, and unharmed. Volcarona used overheat, and Richard was no more. I used Thing's Superpower and took whatever was left of Volcarona's HP. 

I was the champion, but I felt stupid.

Now I have a level 68 Tyranitar, and things are going smoothly, aside from my inability to fly. I still have a LeafGreen and Platinum Nuzlocke, but I love Generation V so much, I didn't wanna do anything else.

For my part, I'm doing a Pokemon Black run, and found it overall too easy- losing only one pokemon through the first 7 gyms. But the dragon gym was a bit daunting- no ice moves on my team, no real way to get an advantage (beyond abusing Audinos). Fighting through the trainers, I found two good fighters still:

**Bongo** the Darmanitan with Sheer Force was just able to crush things with his excellent speed and Hammer Arm. He also had some Bright Powder, I hoped would help offset the total lack of defense. To my surprise, he was joined with **Song** the Unfezant who did surprisingly well in taking down some of the trainers. **Song**, with her natural Super Luck carried the Scope Lens, mostly because I found it appropriate. It never was a good idea, and I am fully aware of that. (there is no theme in my names; these two just happen to be similar)

His first two got taken out no problem. Then Haxorus was out and I freaked. I wanted this thing down as soon as I could- it had to be **Bongo** to take it out. Haxorus tanked like it was nothing, just dragon dancing it off. It was clear that if I lost one, I would lose them all, and it wasn't in my favor considering I was also destroying my own speed with Hammer Arm.

**Bongo** would not make it. Destroyed in an instant with a dragon tail, but Haxorus was in the red. **Song** still had Quick Attack. We can still survive!

""Leader Drayden used a hyper potion!""

Maybe there is some way. I have an X Defend, right? My gigalith might be able to tank it out. Maybe he'll dance some some and I can... something. But **Song**, you're gone. Just... try Fly, I don't even know.

Haxorus comes in with the slash, **Song**'s life bar goes down- yellow, then red, then... 27 hp?? WHAT. **Song**'s last gift will be this fly, I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but we'll need it. It won't kill Haxorus, but it's like **Song** is saying, ""I don't blame you."" Except that...

It's a critical hit. Haxorus fainted.

I... **Song**!! You are some kind of turkey sized dragon slayer!",,False,self,t5_2setk,False,,61,True,t3_1e9uaq,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1e9uaq/your_most_epic_moments/,

The first pokemon to ask to join your team is the only pokemon to join your team in that dungeon

If it faints, you have to release it or never use it again

Legendaries are optional, but if it does join your team, you can't use it on your team for dungeons

After you can go solo, if you use your partner and it faints, you have to release it or never use it again. Also, if you faint after you go solo, you have to pick a different pokemon and you can never play as ""you"" again

So, what do you guys think?

EDIT: I've decided to come up with a few optional rules as well

Must only walk to heal, can't use berries

Can't use apples when you are hungry, only elixirs, gummis, berries, etc.

Can't restore PP, once it's gone, it's gone and you have to wait to make it out of the dungeon

If the dungeon has two different levels, i.e. Steam Cave, Upper Steam Cave, you can count that as two separate areas for getting pokemon to join you. Or not

I've been having a ton of fun lurking the Nuzlocke board and reading the comics and was thinking of trying my hand at one, I've done a couple Nuzlocke runs that have failed horribly and thought I'd make a comic about a new one- so here's my question to you....What version would you like to see a comic of?

I wasn't too worried because i had enough Xdefense for everyone, and cherry knew swords dance *and* slash. instant crit death in gen 1. cherry mowed through abra, but kadabra was much tougher. cherry took her down though, and gained a level! i taught her flamethrower, and was ready to take down alakazam. alakazam was faster than i thought and set up a light screen, and got a crit hit on cherry, making her faint! i had to bring out my snorlax, Lazyboy to finish him off. 

after the battle. the evolution animation begun. i had forgotten, charmeleon gained a level! before my eyes, she evolved into charizard! i figured what was the use, with her fainting, but when i checked my pokemon, she had about 30 hp! evolving gave her hp, bringing her back to life! i knew it was meant to be, and allowed it. and me and cherry went all the way to the hall of fame.",,False,self,t5_2setk,False,,,True,t3_qe7w4,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/qe7w4/the_charizard_that_made_me_believe_in_miracles/,

Back in the beginning, I had my starter bulbasaur, and my rattata which was my first capture, as well as a few miscellaneous guys that I didn't care too much about. I was doing the Nugget Bridge when my beloved rattata got hit by a critical hit and died. I was heart-broken to have to release my first capture. My team took a major hit as well, because I was only focusing on Bulbasaur and Rattata at the time. 

Fast forward to Cinnabar Island. I was in the Pokemon Mansion. I was just kind of rushing through, using my Vaporeon to wash away the firey pokemon residing within. I came across a random Raticate. Since I was in a rush I just clicked run away. The raticate was too fast so it declined my run. Irritated I clicked on surf. The raticate barely survived the attack. I was switching my move cursor over to quick attack to land the final blow, until I noticed something. It had failed to catch my attention previously but the Raticate was red. I was in a battle with a Shiny Raticate and I tried to run from it and kill it. Overjoyed, I threw and ultra ball capturing my second ever shiny pokemon (my first was a shiny electrike, but I used pokeradar in Platinum, so this is my first random encounter shiny) It was a god send it was faster than my Vaporeon preventing my escape and didn't die to my surf. It does however make me wonder, if I have seen more shiny pokemon in my days and just dismissed them without thinking about it. I will forever cherish this Raticate and use him sparingly in the memory of his deceased brother. Might even be a good idea to send him to Platinum, then White now so I'll have him there with no worries. 

Remember, if a cherished partner ever dies on you, to keep your head up. You never know who you'll run into later on.

By randomizing the starters I ended up with Mudkip, who turned out to be a female so I named her Zora (Zelda lore).

We missed out on our opportunities to capture Ralts and Shroomish early on the game (boo for low percentage appearances) so Zora and I were alone as we trekked through the early stages of the game to Dewford Town. We luckily picked up an Aron (Spike, from Land Before Time) in Granite Cave. He was much too young to have any real purpose, so we began bait and switch training him once we reached Slateport.

As the good older sibling, Zora time and time again absorbed the damage from hits as Spike grew up. By the time we passed through Meteor Falls Zora had fully evolved into Swampert, and I had grown beyond attached and fond of her. Eventually Trapinch (Sparx, from the Spyro the Dragon games I loved as a kid), Cacnea (Shactus) and Anorith (Wolverine) joined our party of two to make a family of five.

Shactus wasn't around for long, as he fell victim to a Critical Hit from a Goldeen, but the other two leeched of Zora's power behind Exp. Share as we progressed through the journey. Zora was everything you could expect from a starter and more-- a loyal and tank of a team member. Although my team had a glaring weakness to water and grass, we persevered on. She had participated in well over 90% of the battles that had gone on thus far.

We arrived at Mt. Pyre and soon engaged in a double battle with a pair of Psychics. We found ourselves up against a Wobbuffet and he Destiny Bonded Zora. Unfortunately--- I had nubbishly mistaken the use of Destiny Bond for Perish Song in this battle--- and I took down Wobb with a Surf the following turn-- and he took Zora with him.

Playing on an emulator, I had to minimize the screen and process the events that had just transpired. Shellshocked would be an understatement to describe the degree of emotion that I felt--- a sudden wave of sadness and wishing that it had been another Pokemon would have been taken instead-- but not Zora... not Zora.

We laid her to rest there in Mt. Pyre at Level 47. Our resolve grew stronger after that-- Spike matured into Aggron soon after and Wolverine became Armaldo. Sparx wouldn't be alive much longer either-- as a level 44 Vibrava he succumbed to a C/H Selfdestruct by an Electrode in the Aqua Hideout. I buried him alongside Zora.

In blind and raging fury, I challenged the Lilycove Gym with just two Pokes, and Spike/Wolverine performed admirably to honor their fallen family members. I picked up a Staryu (Starscream) and plan to continue our journey soon.

I quicksave mapped my file right before releasing Zora-- so in an alternate reality she still exists, and I can see her from time to time still alive.",,False,self,t5_2setk,False,,,True,t3_okr6u,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/okr6u/gone_too_soon/,

I know if you are new to this, it can be very confusing whether or not you are breaking any rules, but the basis are these:

* If your pokemon faints, it's dead and you have to release it or box it permanently.

* You can only catch the first pokemon you see on a route, and only one per route.

(Note that I copied these DIRECTLY from the sidebar, which is a tool that very few of you seem to use.)

As long as you follow those rules, congrats! you're nuzlocking! any other rules are ABSOLUTELY up to you. here are some common ones:

* Dupes clause (if you meet a pokemon you have already caught, you can try for another one)

* Gift pokemon are just that: gifts, and aren't counted as a catch. (this means free pokemon, magikarp salesman, free eggs, and casino pokemon; really anything you don't have to catch.)

* Mandatory nicknames

* tradeveloutions= completely legitimate

* no legendaries

Keep in mind, these rules are COMPLETELY optional and you can also make your own to adjust difficulty. Look at Vitehite, for example, he adds rules all the time to make his 'lockes *even more* challenging.
The point is, nuzlockes are what you make of them, and as long as you follow the basic rules you are doing it right. Don't get caught up in the details- do what you want! Happy 'locking!

**TL;DR: Rules aren't as important as you think, just have fun with it.**

I can now stop panicking every time I have a battle!

My strategy was simple - only have three dedicated pokemon for battling, and raise them to high levels. They were Chester (Grotle), Buzz (Luxray) and Aqua (Vaporeon). Tragedy struck my starter as Jupiter wiped him out in Eterna. That left me raising two pokemon, which worked out really well. Both of them had good defences and Buzz covered Physical attacking while Vaporeon covered Special attacking.

My backup support (HM slaves) consisted of Chopper the Staravia, Freckles the Bidoof and Skull the Cranidos. Squidward the Tentacool joined briefly at the end to Waterfall me to the League.

All six joined me as we Sparked, Surfed, Crunched, Ice Beamed and Shadow Balled our way through. Only Buzz and Aqua were able to battle, so I had to be careful. The Elite Four always used to consist of me + a stock of Revives (and the precious Max Revives i saved for the final battles). This time, I had zero. When we got to Cynthia, my battle bros were both on level 70. I knew we were good enough. But a little slip up could destroy everything.

It went great! Unfortunately, Squidward and Skull were 'sacrificed' to help heal my two battlers. Chopper and Freckles survived, which was really important as they were my cheerleading squad throughout the game. A notable mention to Easter the Probopass too (he survived!), who gave me peace of mind earlier in the game against those dreaded SelfDestruct Geodudes.

What of the casualties? Despite hating the idea of a Death Box, I tried it out this time and I loved the idea. It spurred me on to beat everyone (especially in my final confrontation with Jupiter... bitch.). Of course my starter's death was the toughest, RIP Chester. I also found the death of Candy (my Buneary) to be almost the hardest to deal with. A few others died too, like Grill the Ponyta and Cyber the Porygon. RIP guys.

I can't wait to trade my survivors over to HG and see them walk behind me, and join my team over there. I'm gonna miss the excitement now. The Nuzlocke run has been the most enjoyable runthrough of a pokemon game ever.

1365999242.0,17,self.nuzlocke,1cdby8,Just completed my first nuzlocke; it feels great.,MyLittleDarkKnight,18,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/1cdby8/just_completed_my_first_nuzlocke_it_feels_great/,"Just completed my first nuzlocke, which was on Black 2 normal mode. What a nerve-wracking experience. I didn't realize how intense a nuzlocke would be until I lost my first Pokemon, a Sunkern, almost immediately after catching it.

I think my number one expense in this run was Super Repels. There are so many trainer battles in BW2 that if you fight all of them as well as some Audinos here and there, you should be good without having to grind as much on weak wild Pokemon. Lucky Egg was a godsend.

I went through a bit of a crisis prior to the Elite 4 when I realized that I didn't have a way of handling Shauntal's ghost types. I didn't have anything in my previous catches that would be effective against Shauntal and have good synergy with the rest of my team. 

So I looked up the Pokemon available in Victory Road and found that you can catch a Zweilous in one specific room, but it only has a 20% appearance rate. I bought tons of Super Repels and made it to the room, crossing my fingers the whole time that the first Pokemon that appeared would be Zweilous. I was almost crying when I saw it appear.

I trained every member of my team up to at least level 60 and evolved Zweilous. Thanks to that Hydreigon, I was able to make it through the Elite 4 with no losses, though there were a few close calls against Iris's Lapras and Archeops as well as Grimsely's Scrafty.

This is the team that made it all the way. The level they ended up at is listed first, followed by the level they were found at in parenthesis:

* Mencken the Hydreigon - 65 (50)
* Blitzer the Walrein - 63 (40)
* Ochs the Gliscor - 62 (37)
* Turner the Volcarona - 61 (35)
* Bly the Gothitelle - 60 (24)
* Sinclair the Cofagrigus - 60 (19)

The path to the Elite 4 was not without its losses. These are the Pokemon who died along the way:

* Day the Sunkern - 7 (2)
* Pulitzer the Magnemite - 22 (13)
* Zorua the Zorua -27 (25)
* Murrow the Stoutland - 33 (4)
* Cronkite the Pignite - 35 (5)
* Marconi the Sandslash - 49 (20)
* Buckley the Crobat - 52 (32)

Other Pokemon who were with the team for a long time and didn't die, but didn't make it into the Hall of Fame. Their contributions should not be ignored:

* Greeley the Rattata - 18 (15)
* Hearst the Trubbish - 27 (14)
* Capote the Azumarill - 41 (26)
* Talese the Zangoose - 57 (32)

I suppose the next step for this Nuzlocke run is to complete the biggest post-game challenges as well: including Alder, the Black Tower and a rematch with the Elite 4. That's going to be tough.

Im STOKED!

Team: 
59 female Courtney the Camerupt
57 female Fi the Minun
50 female Edge the Skarmory
53 male Forsaken the Banette
52 male Broski the Hariyama
56 male Powderpuff the Walrein 

Elite Four Breakdown, if Anyone Cares:
MVP: definitely goes to Powderpuff, he was a tank, took a ridiculous number of hits, crits, and statuses, powered thru situation pokemon like Kingdra (OMG KINGDRA. It was a bodyslam fest. Kingdra's bodyslams paralyzed 14 of 15 times. No joke. He used all of them before i could load an X attack or two and body slam him back to oblivion. Thank Arceus for Leppa Berries is all I gotta say!) Powderpuff used a similar tactic on Milotic.

Acts of Heroism: Courtney was head to head with a Tentacruel. One surf would have 4x damage KO'd her. Fi, luckily, got a thunderwave in before taking a sludgebomb crit, and this gave Courtney initiative to crack an earthquake (paired with soft sand) to destroy tentacruel. Never underestimate thunderwave!

Forsaken also recieved a tactical set-up from Fi on Ludicolo, which gave him the opportunity to do a curse and then heal up and weather the surfs. 

Honorable Mentions: Broski would have played a larger role if he had not been taken out early by a perfectly aimed Sheer Cold. No one saw it coming : /

Pivotal Moments: 

Fi's Death: Pre-battle, I had banked on Fi's abilities for Wallace almost exclusively. She was killed halfway through, and I thought we were goners. I sent Courtney in, I admit, as a sponge so I could pop a heal before getting either Forsaken or Powderpuff back in the mix. I took a gamble with earthquake and it payed off. Team Morale surged.

The Ludicolo Onslaught:
Forsaken was barely surviving surf hits. Ludicolo was paralyzed, however, and when he succumbed, Forsaken was able to pop curse and then a hyper potion before falling back into the surf onslaught. This was a really risky tactic, however, because if Ludicolo got even 1 critical, Forsaken would've been lost. I commend his bravery.

The Nuzlocke Run is an exercise in strategy, tactics, self control, determination, and faith. It was a rewarding expenditure of my time that I do not regret at all.
