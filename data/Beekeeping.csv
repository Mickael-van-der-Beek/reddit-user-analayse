1332857256.0,36,self.Beekeeping,rfunj,"Watching, catching, and moving my first swarm... aka the best story I have about beekeeping yet. ",pippx,38,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/rfunj/watching_catching_and_moving_my_first_swarm_aka/,"**sorry for the wall of text, but this is basically a short story about my most recent adventure with the bees**

Some of you may remember my rather frantic post about a week ago - I was seeing swarming activity in my yard and didn't have a clue of what to do with them. So what did I end up doing? Nothing. Because the bees did nothing. I watched as the swarm cloud got smaller and smaller until there wasn't a single bee in my yard that wasn't busily going into or out of one of my hives.

So I had a normal week of school, gardening, and bee watching. 

This weekend was a mini vacation at the beach for some friends and I, and when I finally came home on Sunday, I was completely exhausted. I walked into my bedroom to unpack, and what to do you - the bees were swarming again! However, this time is different - they aren't just sitting in my backyard doing nothing. They are actually traveling. Panic!

I go outside and watch as the cloud moves (quickly!) from my yard into my neighbors yard. My husband joins me and we start to wonder - *are they going for that tree? Will they go farther? What are they doing?* Eventually we realized that the bees were all clumping together on a yard swing that the wind had knocked over. Clustered together on the back of a seat cushion, they were hovered there about a foot off the ground. 

I called my beekeeper friend, and he relayed the following instructions: Get one of your empty boxes, put it on a make-shift stand, spray the bees down with sugar water, then shake them off and into the box. 

I send my husband inside to make sugar water while I try and figure out how we're going to do this. I don't think one person can lift the swing and hold it while the other is thrashing at it, so I call over one of my neighbors (who, conveniently, has been very interested in my bees and asked if I would install a hive in her yard). I ask her ""Want to come catch your bees?"" and she, thrilled, arrives with her daughter to help. 

The process went pretty smoothly - lifted the swing, wet the bees, beat em into a box. I got stung twice on my right boob (my first sting!), but we watched as the bees made their way straight into the box.

We decided to leave them until it got dark, then examine their state and see if they would be moveable. The answer was pretty much ""no"". My husband and I went out, lifted the swing, and moved the box from the ground to a wheelbarrow. There were still a lot of bees attached to the cushions, and I worried that if I moved the box, I took the chance of leaving the queen behind on the cushions. So I wet them down again, then used a broom to sort of scoop/sweep the cushion bees into the box. Most of them got in, but there were still a good amount on the swing. I decided to leave them overnight, hoping that when the sun woke them up the next day, those on the cushions would realize there was a better location in the box, and move there.

And, lovely intelligent bees, they did just that. So last night, my husband went out and examined the bees. Everyone was in the hive, safe asleep. I took a few dishtowels and blocked the front and back entrance, then covered the top with an old towel (I didn't have a lid for them, so they had a Rubbermaid lid on top that wasn't quit doing the job). 

Then came the hard part - moving them. The neighbor whose yard they had landed is in the process of fixing a drainage problem in his yard. Our neighborhood sits on nothing but clay, so water has been pooling in his yard, specifically right in front of, and beyond, his gate door. He's been adding sand and gravel to it in hopes of improving draining, so right now, there is about 8 inches of water-soaked sand and mud between me and the bees, and my yard. 

I gently lifted the wheelbarrow and started making my way through his yard. The sand and silt made it tricky, and at one point my husband had to jump the fence and come lift the nose of the wheelbarrow out of the muck. But we made it to my yard, and took a little breather. I had my husband retrieve a big blanket from in the house, just for added bulk around the bee box (both to keep them from flying out as well as to keep them a little calm [this is me making wild guesses about bee psychology right here]). 

Then, the walking. I walked those bees half a mile, through a dark neighborhood, wheeling this large, blanketed box all the way. Many a car drove by, and I wondered what they thought I was doing. Baby smuggling? Robbing people? I dearly wanted someone to stop and ask so I could say I was transporting bees!

Finally we get to the house of my neighbor who has wanted a hive in her yard. It's about 9:00 at night, but the upstairs lights are on, so I ring the bell. Down comes her husband in his pajamas, and when he realizes what I'm here for, his face lights up and he goes running up the stairs to get his wife. They both come down, and we start the process of planting the bees. 

I had no idea what would happen when I lifted the blanket. Would they stay calm? Would their reaction be cartoonish, whooshing out in a flash flood of bees ready to attack? We lifted off the big blanket, and no movement. I lowered my head to the box and could hear a gentle murmur of bees inside. We lifted them out, make-shift base and all, and set them on the square of bricks that her husband had set out for the hive to rest on. We gently straightened the box, as it had become quite crooked on it's plywood and 2x4 base, then removed the towel from up-top. No bees flying around menacingly, so I pulled away the front and back blockers. Slowly, a few bees crawled out and walked around the outside of the hive, crawling in through the entrances and top. 

Seeing my bees in another yard was so cool. I talked to the neighbors about putting in a water feature somewhere so the bees would have fresh water, as well as the kind of activity that they could expect. I also explained that there was a chance the bees would leave - because we moved them within 2 miles of their original hive, the potential for screwing up their internal compass was there. I told them I'd be checking the hive every day this week to see what kind of activity was going on.

The whole time I was wheeling them down the street, I felt like some kind of bizarre bee themed underground-railroad. Sneaking through the night with this box of bees, tucked safely under an old blanket. It was seriously one of the coolest things I've ever done with my bees, and I just had to share it with you guys!

I had not been in this bee yard for about a week. Last week I lost a hive and the wax moth had moved in. So I took the frames out and I had basically taken the nuc box and flipped it upside down on the ground. Well I figured I would place the box in the rack and and clean up. While not even thinking about I grabbed the box and man handled it and than got my a bunch of angry bees crawling all over me. 

Apparently a swarm moved in shortly after I flipped the box as there were 3 small pieces of comb but also there were a good number of bees in the box. So with my pride hurt and a few other places on my body I put the box back. If the bees stay I will move them to better accommodations this weekend.

I've been stung 8 times at once before, and I think a total of 14 stings in one day before. Every time in the past has only been an annoyance. I'm in Texas, and it's been about 70 degrees for about a month.

While checking the mail, I noticed 100 or 200 bees flying around the entrance of my front hive. They are being robbed. I watch from ten yards away and a bee stings me on the back of the hand. I turn and run about 100 yards, to the house. I ran because I didn't want to chance another one getting me before I could walk away, and running is fun.

Get into house, get knife and scrape sac out. Stinger breaks. Head to bathroom, and get tweezers to pull stinger out, all calm and mellow. Then the itching starts. OMG, the itching. Everywhere and all at once. I hop into shower so I can rub my skin rather than scratch. By the time I get wet, I can start to tell that things are getting bad fast, and I'm past the point of caring about itching or scratching.

Hop out of shower, and go vomit in toilet. Get up and walk to phone. Call neighbor because I'm alone and ask for benadryl. Neighbor is on the way. Hang up. It keeps getting worse. Vision starts to black out and some tunnel vision. I start breathing faster now. Notice a lump in my throat. Get up off bed, and head to desk for epipen. Hard to move, no energy, all muscles hurt. My abdomen feels like a slab of pain. Keeps getting worse. Really no swelling at all.

Call 911. Open pen and give address to operator. Ask if I should give myself shot. They don't give medical advice. ""I'm fixing to give myself the shot."" Stab leg with epipen, and watch the needle go through my thumb, and shoot the stuff inside it at the wall beside me. I know I have a really sad and disappointed expression on my face.

Some amount of the shot must have made it into my system. Within a minute, I start feeling better. All of a sudden the tunnel vision stops. My breathing slows seconds later, but the lump in my throat is still there. Tell the 911 operator I am feeling better. Another minute passes. Feel much better. Tell her to cancel the ambulance. Thank her. Hang up. Call neighbor, who is at the front gate. Give combination to gate. Look in mirror on way outside, and I'm red as a beet with a ghost white face and red eyes. Go home with neighbor to keep an eye on me. 

Took neighbor 18 minutes to get here. Pretty remote out here. Ambulance told operator they were half way here. From the moment of itching to epipen squirting at the wall was about 8 minutes I would guess. 911 call was less than 13 minutes. I would guess 5 or 8 minutes. From the bee sting to itching was about 2 or 3 minutes. Maybe 4. Was in shower maybe 1 minute. Lump in my throat went away in about ten or 15 minutes after shot. Maybe 25 minutes.

I was scared. I don't think I was hyperventilating, but it's possible I was. The blacking out and tunnel vision started before the heavy breathing. I was concentrating on not passing out. I think I was close to that.

Things I did right: Kept the epipen in an easy to find and grab place. Called neighbor and 911. Used epipen. Kept consciousness.

I have no doubt the epipen made it stop. Got better in like 30 to 40 seconds. After a minute or two, I felt like things were getting close to normal. Epipen made it stop getting worse, and then get better.

From when it started, it kept getting worse, and that was the scariest part. I didn't know if it would stop getting worse.",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,False,,,True,t3_184e1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/184e1o/got_stung_once_today_had_a_reaction_used_epipen/,

I had my first hive die after a winter due to varroa.  Then last year i bought 3 packages of bees.  One hive died or left, I think that was my error more than anything.  The other two ended up dying over the winter.  All three hives had issues with getting very much brood though and I suspect there was a batch of bad queens or something.  They were marketed as Minnesota hygienic.  Anyone had any experience with those?  

Anyway, I have an order in for two more packages of bees and am hoping for the best.  I have decided to go with Italians as that I what I did the first year and they were excellent at producing brood and honey.   They wont be here until next weekend so for now (until today) I am a bee-less beekeeper with a bunch of empty boxes.  

I have one hive sitting in my backyard with a few combs in it and today I witnessed a swarm take up residence in it.  It was an awesome experience to see first hand.

We were having a birthday party and had my whole family and some friends over when someone mentioned a huge cloud of insects flying by off in the distance.   I walked closer and immediately noticed it was a swarm.  They flew right over the crowd of us and went right for the empty hive.  They all bearded on the front of the hive and  within about 5-10 minutes all the bees had entered the hive.

Needless to say, my faith in beekeeping has been restored and I can barely believe that me and my whole family were able to witness such an awesome event!",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,False,,,True,t3_smacp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/smacp/amazing_experience_today/,

I successfully removed the swarm, gave them some honey and thought all was well. But ever since the swarm (when they found out I had bees), the bees have been 'chasing the wife out of their yard' and she is 'terrified to leave the house'.

I have moved the bees far away from the property line and pointed the entrance away from their yard. These are also really docile, friendly bees. I've never had a problem in my yard and I have a one year old running around outside, and none of my other neighbours have had any trouble and the neighbour's husband hasn't experienced this either.

This morning, she came over and had a tantrum about the bees, like full on 5 year old meltdown style. I'm really not sure how to respond, I've tried to accommodate her, the bees aren't aggressive and I am well within all bylaws.

**Update**
Thanks for the sympathy - I offered for her to put on the bee suit and let me come check out the problem in her yard, but that just set off another rant unfortunately. The bees have a good water source, so I don't think that is the problem, but good suggestion. I let her know that none of the other neighbors have had a problem, but according to her, that is because the bees have 'targeted' her and now think of her specifically as an enemy. Logical reasoning has gone out the window. 

She's so worked up she has started screaming profanities at my family while we are out in are yard, and this morning she sprayed my one year old boy with the hose. We are going to speak with the police tonight - all this because of a gardener who hates honey bees! Good times! :P

With the free time I've had I began to branch out with my interests.  

After reading that the US needed 100,000 more beekeepers I started reading about Bees and I think Beekeeping might make a suitable career for me.  So I have a few questions.

**Should I consider going back to school to study Apiculture?**

I can't seem to find degree programs, mostly a course here a course there kind of things.

**What would be the most effective way to find work/experience?**

I've tried contacting the few beekeepers I've met locally.  Long Island seems to have very limited Beekeeping opportunities but I'm not opposed to moving anywhere.

**Is there any chance any of you need a smart, hardworking, and friendly assistant who is eager  to learn?**

I figure I might as well put it out there.  I'd work for peanuts.

Recently the new head of the Apiary division of the Florida Dept of Agriculture decided they are going to bring back enforcement of a law that basically makes all feral hives pests. You now are suppose to have a Pest Control Operators license in order to be able to charge to do bee removals. 

http://swfbees.com/blog/?p=219

Just today the lobby group the Florida State Beekeepers Association that is suppose to represent beekeepers just sold out every small time beekeeper to a group that does not effectively or by design represent them. A group call the Honeybee Technical Council . With a demented sense of pride the FSBA stood with the governor as he signed an unconstitutional bill into law making the Apiary Division now the bee police. 

 http://www.flsenate.gov/laws/statutes/2011/586.161

The HTC can now make whatever codes and ordinances they see fit. The only recourse a beekeeper has now is to sue the state of Florida. 

The Florida State Beekeepers Association leaders are shown here with the our governor (a convicted felon) signing away the rights of beekeepers.

Yeah. This winter sucks. We're alternating 3-4 days of 50F+ weather with 20F- weather. Just a few weekends ago, I witnessed several hundreds of them having their cleansing flights. Every time I've topped off their feeder, thousands of bee heads have popped up through the hole in the inner cover to find what smells so good.

There was a baseball sized group of bees left, dead and far too small to keep themselves warm. No queen in the middle. Somewhere not too far from my bee yard there's a big pile of dead bees who thought they were going on a tropical cruise...poor girls.

I'm gobsmacked.

They arrived Friday and when they were still there the next day I realized the universe was telling me it was time to put up or shut up about keeping bees. After calling the bee hotline and getting some advice I went off and bought a basic hive and a veil.

The transfer of the bees was surprisingly easy. That evening I checked on the hive and I could hear what sounded like hopefully happy housekeeping. 

This morning I came out to check and I saw no traffic in or out of the hive, and a couple dead bees at the front. There is no strong humming sound from the hive but it is still occupied. There were still bees at on the branch they had swarmed to -- the bees were starting to clump up again so I moved that clump the best I could to the hive.

So I figured the best way to journal my experiences as a beekeeper would be to keep a blog. At best it'll interest someone enough to get started in beekeeping or a fellow beginner can see my issues and how they were solved. At worst it's a nice journal to keep track of my hive notes and to record what I've achieved. Oh, and I'm also a homebrewer so I'll be brewing mead at some point.

If anyone also has a beekeeping blog and would like to reference each other I think that'd be a pretty cool thing, so feel free to pm me :)

About me: I'm 26 years old, back in college full time, and will have my Associate Degree at the end of the year. I plan on transferring to University of Florida next year for Entomology with a specialty in bees and social insects. 


Location: South Florida

Methodology: I'm really interesting in the treatment free methods of beekeeping and have been reading a lot about it.

Bees: I'm three days in with my nuc of Italian-Carniolan and have installed them in their permanent hive box. A feral colony should be acquired in the next week or two as I've made plans to assist a beekeeper who consistently does at least one swarm/cut-outs per week. The plan is to grow both and split both. 

Hive setups: Currently running a Langstroth setup with plastic foundation. Once my hives are split then I plan on switching two of the splits to foundationless. Experimenting with a Warre' hive and Top Bar is something I'll do at some point since I really enjoy crafting. I also have interested family who I'm thinking of making a Top Bar for as a Christmas present.

Side goals: The reason for getting a feral in addition to supplied nucs is because I would like to develop my own queens. Mixing the proven ""survivor"" traits of the feral bees with the characteristics of my Italian-Carniolans, which so far have been very gentle and extremely busy with their brood rearing + honey/pollen gathering.

I'd like to branch into small scale pollenation next year or commercial queen raising next year. It'd be nice to focus on the bees as a small scale operation instead of relying fully on part time work while in college.

**tl;dr I'm 26 and in South Florida, newb beekeeper, starting a beekeeping specific blog to record my beekeeping going ons, langstroth hives to begin with, Italian-Carniolans + ferals, treatment free, goal is to brew mead + build up to small scale pollenation and queen production.**",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,False,,,True,t3_1cukvw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/1cukvw/started_a_blog_to_journal_my_experiences_as_a/,

1360001781.0,21,self.Beekeeping,17vmeo,Hello Reddit Beekeepers! My 7 year old came up with an excellent question about bees that we may be using for her science fair. Can you help?,phnx0221,24,3,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/17vmeo/hello_reddit_beekeepers_my_7_year_old_came_up/,"Location: Phoenix Arizona

We have three very large (approx 4'x4') rosemary planters in our front yard that are pollinated by hundreds of domestic bees every year. Because we live in a desert climate, the bees are active almost year round, and there are many times where I will walk outside the find the rosemary crawling with 100-200 bees. They are very docile and we've grown an appreciation that we can work in our garden in the midst of them with no problems. We really love our bees.

One of the neighborhood kids told us that the hive is not far away, in an irrigation hole across the street. My daughter and I will go looking for it today. When we found this out, she had two questions:

* If the bees are gathering pollen primarily from the rosemary, will the honey have a rosemary taste to it?

* (**This is her potential science fair question**) If the bees gather pollen primarily from one flower (in this case, rosemary), and use that pollen to feed the larvae in the cells, will the ""baby bees"" grow up with a preference for that flower? Will they pass other flowers if that kind is near?

I'm wondering if any of you can help with the answer from what you've seen with your bees, as well as any recommendations for how we could test this. Beekeeping ourselves, as much as I would love it, is not an option. However, I do have friends with beekeeper connections that I could utilize.

Thanks!

Edit: formatting

**Edit 2**: I really appreciate all of the informative answers you've given. It seems we really have a lot to learn about bees and the different types of things they will forage for! We learned that while our rosemary planters seem large and abundant to us, there are many more sources of pollen or nectar around. This is definitely true, as we live in an urban community with a lot of gardens and a lot of livestock. Even if rosemary were the only flower available, this single diet would be seriously detrimental, if not fatal, to the bees, due to lack of constant availability.

We have learned a lot from you Beekeepers and bee enthusiasts. Thank you so much for your time, links, expertise, and advice. We'll be looking elsewhere for her science project, but we'll definitely be watching our bees and learning more about them. 

Thank you, and happy beekeeping! :)",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,1360084012.0,,,True,t3_17vmeo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/17vmeo/hello_reddit_beekeepers_my_7_year_old_came_up/,

While I was not around, a wild hive was noticed in a derelict building. The owner wasted no time in hiring an exterminator to eliminate the hive. The exterminator opened the inside of a wall enough to find the hive, then fumigated. He charged $200 for this, and did no clean-up. When I saw the results, I knew that the remaining comb/honey had to be removed to avoid later infestation of pests. The exterminator contacted the owner and advised them that this task should be done. This task fell to me. Sadly, I have no pictures. 

The hive completely filled the space between one pair of studs on an exterior wall, and was expanding into the next cavity. The comb within the full space was very dark, and I expect this hive has been there at least 3-4 years. New comb could be seen in one corner at the bottom of the space, and the top of the next cavity.
  I filled a 4 foot kiddie pool nearly level to the top with the wasted comb/honey. I was sorely tempted to at least recover the wax, but was concerned about residual toxicity from the fumigant. 
  When I began, I saw a few bees (6-10) investigating, trying to gain access to the hive. As work progressed, and honey began to pool on the floor, 6-10 became at least hundreds, robbing that ruined honey. If I were not aware of bee behavior, I would have been concerned. I was nearly done when the man I work for came out for a look. You should have seen the look on the face of this rugged tough guy of 76 when he saw the mass of bees in the air.
He could not wait one moment to dispose of that comb. I wanted to merely dump the contents into an established burn pit, knowing that bees would rob all of the honey in short order, and be gone, and that the wax would make the next pit burn a bit more interesting. He would have none of this, as he was concerned about the continued presence of the robber bees. He insisted on burying the old hive immediately.  
   There was just one problem, I was not done cleaning out the last bits of comb. Without the mass of comb/honey to keep the hundreds of bees busy, I was surrounded by a cloud of curious foragers. This exceeded my comfort level by a few hundred bees. And I decided it was best to let them finish up whatever honey was left, and that I will do the final clean up at a later date.


tl/dnr: Hive found, people scared, hive killed, I had to clean up, lots of robber bees exceeded my comfort level.

I did not intend for this to become a book, so I apologize.
I am wondering if capped honey in a hive that was fumigated would pose a hazard to the hives of robber bees? Perhaps it was best that the remains were buried. Would the wax be recoverable? Of course, it would be best to know the fumigant used, alas I do not.

I collected my first bees from a swarm a month ago (in Auckland). They were up in a tree and we easily shaken into a box and taken home. 

I've built a top bar hive out of found materials, spare parts and wood scraps. The main building material is a thin but sturdy aluminium sign board with a sheet of plastic in between the metal sides (I don't know what the stuff is called). The hive has a removable bottom (which was useful when I first introduced the bees), but I've decided to keep it off. Summer is just starting in Auckland, and our winters are fairly mild.

They seem to be happy and well fed by the city foliage - none of them have tried to sting me yet :)

This group harvests honey in a way that allows the hives to recover so the forager can return in about 5 months and re-harvest.  This appears to be a unique behavior among honey-collectors in hunter-gatherer societies and I am trying to learn more about it.   

I was wondering if anyone here has information about honey-bee behavior in response to hive destruction.  In particular, how much honey can be collected while still allowing the hive to recover, what types of insults will result in the colony moving to a new tree... and other related issues.  I am also looking for more basic information on expected density of hives in different regions, particularly in Africa.

Maybe some of you work with wild hives in southern Africa (I know that farmers in that region do occasionally harvest honey), but even folks with domestic setups may be able to point me in the right direction.

Thanks.

And the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower, and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers. A bee-keeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey. Another bee-keeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely, says that the bee gathers pollen-dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the bees existence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the bee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first, the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes, the more obvious it becomes that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension.

My first mistake: 
My first hive was a five frame Nuc, and since it was a Nuc there was a lot going on, so i was fascinated. I opened the hive to see what was going on way to much and it caused the bees to abscond. This was even more problematic since not only did I loose the core of my hive, but I only had a single queen cell (bad luck).  I was able to get a queen locally which helped save the hive. 

Second Mistake:
In that same hive, I may have been to aggressive in introducing a new queen and while they didn't kill her they didn't accept her. I ended up having to get another queen and pinch the one in the hive. The hive ended up with a very strong showing late in the year and I ended up with about 40lbs of honey from the hive.

I have just received a call from one of our fellow beekeepers to tell me that one of their hives was stolen this past week.

Our hives have become  targets of knowledgeable thieves. Its not an easy task to move a hive of bees so its someone with knowledge of how its done.

What can we do.

Keep your hives out of the public eye

IF you have remote locations, Set up game trail cameras to photograph any visitors. Primarily on the trail coming and going from the hive location or at the hive location.

BRAND (or paint) your equipment with your name or other identifying marks, so if it is stolen it can be identified later.

Strap down the hives to make it difficult to move.

Notify authorities if your hives are stolen to at least make a official report incase someone else gets their hives taken.. A case can be formed then…

Network with other beekeepers in the area to keep a watchful eye and ear.

She triaged our situation; identified and taught us a bunch about Honey, Solitary and other Bees; chatted up our 9 year old (who had a beekeeper visit at school last year, so considers himself in-the-know); told us what to look for (a ball of bees!); schooled us on terms like ""beeline""; and offered to help us set up our own hive.

Do you guys have any suggestions on how I would be able to start a hive?  Contact a local beekeeping guild to see if anybody has some ""free space""?  I stupidly started building my own hive before checking the local regulations...but I **really** want to start my own hive.

The hives aren't as round and symmetrical as they could be, but then again, bees would take a hollow tree as their home.

The hives are prepped with a small wax starter strip, and sticks to give the comb more strength when handling the hive. The only thing I didn't do yet is plaster the outside of the hives with cow dung, to water- and weather proof them.

~~Waiting for a swarm to start a colony with.~~

Edit: just got a call. Half an hour later, the swarm has a new home. The hive will stay there today so all stray bees can find it. I'll pick them up tonight, feed them and they can fly again tomorrow.

Edit2: they're home, in my back garden. It's evening here, so not much is happening anymore. Tomorrow they can fly.

It's always better to go in with a plan rather than just saying, ""Hey, I want a hive. Make it legal!!"" So what do you think? How should I present my case?

I'm thinking about a few restrictions that would make it more palatable for them. How about the following:

* Maximum 1 hive per 1/10 acre, up to a maximum of 4 per acre.
* Minimum of 8' between the hive and neighboring property
* If the hive is less than 30' from the neighboring property, there must be a solid barrier at least 5'6"" high in line of sight between the hive and the neighboring property OR the entrance to the hive must be higher than 5'6"".
* You must notify all neighbors within 100' of the hive in writing of the proposed design and location, giving them up to 30 days to file a protest before putting it in.
* The hive must not be put in a place where it can become an ""attractive nuisance"" for children.
* There must be a source of water on your property, closer to the hive than any water feature of a neighboring property.
* Restrict the queen type to Carnolian or Italian or ____?

My dad is a beekeeper as well and he suggested transferring a frame of brood from the stronger hive to the weaker hive. Has anyone tried this before? Do the brood need to be at any particular stage? Do I just knock all the bees off and transfer the frame by itself?

This is the second time my hives have been checked, first one I was by the side of my mentor who looked at all the frames in both deeps and pronounced that all is well, and I even tasted a bit of spring honey from some burr he scraped off.

Today was my first solo. It's is a lovely sunny day, no wind, it was about 11:30 AM so many of the bees are out and about. I fired up the smoker, had on my jacket and veil and gloves (rubber, not leather, may reconsider, read on...) and was trying not to quake in my boots. Literally boots, worn under a long dress. First hive, all's well, lovely sweet bees, and frames 1 and 10 are almost drawn out completely in the top deep. Bunch of burr comb, with larvae in it, stuck to the bottom, which puzzled me. Do I leave it or scrape it?

Realized that it might be a good idea to have pants on when I felt a bee up inside my dress, resting on the back of my thigh. So I smoked her, and proceeded calmly with my inspection and put everything back, smush free.

Put on long pants.

Inspected the second hive, and these girls were much noisier and pissier and someone stung me on my finger through my glove. To my noob credit, I didn't drop the frame (kept staying to myself, Bee stings are *good* for you!), but I did chicken out a little and did a much lamer inspection, because their comb was drawn even more in the top hive body, and because they were annoyed with me.

Closed up (probably a little rougher than the first hive, or, as I like to think, I was more *confident*) without further incident, chucked the gloves, scraped out the stinger, and am waiting for my heart to stop pounding.

Am wondering if I ought to (not today) go address the burr comb or just figure the bees know what they're doing. And also wonder if I ought to put the shallow honey supers on, or do I let them get the deeps chock full of honey for themselves to get through another NY winter? And, lastly, if I do put the supers on, should I use queen excluders? As with all I've learned re beekeeping, there are conflicting opinions. 

FWIW, I am trying to be the least interventionist I can (I do provide water, in a poultry waterer), but did not give them sugar water. I almost feel guilty about robbing the honey when it's time. But not that guilty.

Thanks in advance for your advice.



TL;DR 1) Is it okay to leave the burr comb at the bottom of the frames
   and 2) Is it too soon to put the honey supers in (these are a first year hives, from nucs)
and 3) Do you guys use/should I use queen excluders?

EDIT: It's four days since I posted this, sun came out, and I re-checked the hives (no gloves and no stings, yay! I WAS much gentler and more careful, jhdawg). One was bursting with bees, frames 1-10 were filled on top, so I put the excluder and medium honey super on. (I couldn't move the top deep to check if the bottom deep was full too, it weighed about 100 lbs and I couldn't lift it alone! I hope that's okay.)

The other hive does not have comb drawn in frames # 1, 2, 9 and 10 in the top deep. There were visible larvae so I assume my queen's good, right? I plan to wait a week before checking that hive again to see if it's ready for the super. Or two, if you think I can go that long. Any idea why two hives on the same 1/3 acre property are so different in terms of drawn comb?",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,True,,,True,t3_i0g0p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/i0g0p/so_my_first_solo_hive_inspection/,

Out of curiosity I was researching bees and beekeeping. It sounded interesting so I asked a buddy who just moved into a house with a 5 1/2 acre lot if he had any interest in beekeeping (we had previously talked about him letting me grow hops on his land so I thought he might let me do that as well). Much to my surprise, he said there was already a two-frame apiary there.

He doesn't seem to have much interest in maintaining it himself, but he said that I could do it if I want to. He thinks the previous owner left a bunch of equipment. He knows there's a smoker, and he hasn't looked for it specifically but there's probably a hive tool and protective suit in the basement somewhere.

Assuming I have all the requisite equipment, how do I get started? The hive is already well established, so what's the first thing I should do? 

My buddy lives about 40 minutes away from me. With traffic (I live in the DC area) it might be more, but I could probably get out there once a week for at least an hour or two if need be. Is this enough time to make a go of it?

I've been looking at books on amazon, and I saw a thread on here from a few months ago with a couple book recommendations such as ""The Practical Beekeeper: Beekeeping Naturally"" and ""The Beekerper's Handbook"". Which is best for a beginner?

Any other general advice? Is there some sort of FAQ or other websites somewhere you guys could point me to?

This is its second season.  They came out of winter very strong, but in late march/early april, i opened them up to expect brood, but was met with an extremelly angry hive and many drones(potentially a laying worker).  They produced a queen cell which i let hatch with 3 frames of bees.  In the remaining frames, i attempted to introduce a mated queen, who was dragged out of her cage and balled until dead.  Once the new queen(that the hive had laid) had hatched, mated, and begun laying, i remerged it with the rest of the hive.  This was in late april.  Her laying was sporadic, but i passed it off as her being young.  However, as they entered June, her productivity hadnt increased at all.  I went out today to find the hive queenless again.  Is potentially just a very weak lineage?  I am strongly considering a merge with a strong hive to at least make use of the remaining workers(there are maybe 2lbs of bees at most now).0",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,False,,,True,t3_1hn8pf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/1hn8pf/the_perpetually_queenless_hive/,

My question is, does it take a specific amount of royal jelly for a larvae to ""switch on"" the queen phenotype or could it be a gradual process in which a larvae being fed royal jelly requires a constant/minimum effective dose over a period of time? If the latter, would there be any evidence of ""semi-queen"" phenotypes?


I'd like to look at the gene expression of a number of genes during the epigenetic changes that take place in queen differentiation, see if there are any patterns or cascades. 

Does anyone know where I could find more info on this? All the papers I've read simply say that queens are fed a diet of almost exclusive royal jelly and workers get none after 3 days after emergence.

I started keeping bees last year with five hives.  Two of them died before the winter hit (mostly due to my piss poor beekeeping I'm assuming) and the other three made it all the way to the spring.  I bought an additional thirty-three packages, made two splits, and caught one swarm bringing the total up to thirty-three.  I lost two again throughout this last season bringing the total number of production colonies to thirty-nine (although not all produced a surplurs of honey).  On top of that I learned to rear queens and produced about twenty nucs, all of which I'm sure are going to die because they were made up to late in the season and didn't produce enough honey for the winter and I was to lazy to feed.  It was more of an experiment then anything.

Long story longer, last year the three hives I had made no honey, I wasn't expecting any honey from the twenty-six packages this year simply because of last years experience.  By the end of September it was apparent I was going to need an extractor and [this](http://imgur.com/tHkC1) was the result.

Did a hive split (with multiple queen cells left in) on May20 and the math I've been taught is that the new queen will emerge on day 19 or so - Jun8.

Did a hive inspection on Jun16 and not a single egg found. We did find two hinged open queen cells and found one queen.  The next time I can go in is Jun24 and the plan is if she's still not laying by that point, she be removed and a frame of eggs put in from my other very healthy hive.

The thought of killing her is awful!  Heck, I feel bad about a bee dying when I get stung.  I will do it though but would love to hear from anyone who many have experienced a similar thing.

I've also been told that it's a good idea to wait a few hours between removing the queen and putting in a frame of eggs.  It gives the hive the chance to realize that they've lost their queen and when they get the new eggs, they start making a new queen right away.

Oh, and how the heck do you catch a queen?  I'm also curious if taking her home and freezing her is more humane than stepping on her.  Yup, I'm a softy.  If I see a bee suffering though, I never hesitate to take care of it....

I surrounded the area in cedar shavings.

I temporarily blocked part of the hive entrance to make it smaller. 

Three directions around the hive have 10+ acres of open field with tall grass, weeds, and trees.

Thank you in advance.

While I was gardening today I watched (what I later counted/estimated to be 120-130 as I skimmed them out of the pool) groups of bees fly into my pool. Bees have been coming all summer, 1-2 at a time to get pool water. These bees usually stand on the edge/wall and get their water and leave (and a few will end up drowning in the pool). Today the bees came in groups of 10 to 15 and rather than standing on the edge, they flew directly into the water. Then another group would follow them. They had no interest in me or anything in the area (and I didn't disturb a hive). Anyone know anything about bees that might explain this behavior?

UPDATE: I went out this morning and there were well over 150-200 bees floating in my pool (these ones weren't so lucky b/c I wasn't there to fish them out). I read a few places that leaving an alternate water source might help--so I put out a bucket of water with a ruler sticking out of it (so they could grab on and get out if they overshot their landing)--no one was in the bucket, but I have never seen so many dead bees before.

I have two supers but only 2 frames in the lower super have comb/bees (most of the bees stay clustered between 2 frames). I checked 1 week ago and the queen's laying and there was about a total of 1 frame of honey stored. There's been a cold snap here in Austin the past few days with lows around 30-35 and highs in the 50s and 60s. 

I checked them again today with the plan of feeding them, and I noticed maybe a dozen dead bees on the bottom of the hive and on the bottom board at the entrance, and the rest of the girls were moving pretty slow.

I removed the empty upper super, and replaced it with an top feeder half full of 2:1 sugar:water syrup, and placed a makeshift entrance reducer of newspaper (no wooden one came with the hive). 

Is there anything else I can do to ensure the health of the hive??

Thank you !

So springtime is upon us in the Southern Hemisphere, which means it's swarm season. Yesterday, inspected my strongest hive which appeared to be very crowded, and in danger of becoming honey-bound but with no queen cells (swarm or supercedure) apparent. The queen in said colony is about 14 months old (a winter supercedure). 

I thought, ""Great! The queen is still young enough that she won't swarm"". So I popped a honey super on to keep the brood nest open, and off I went. 

Fast forward to about 1pm- they swarm! Bees coalesce into a blob on a tree. Go inside, suit up, and sally forth to catch them- they've gone as quickly as they arrived! And now there's a HUGE beard on the original hive, fanning like crazy.... Did they just swarm and then change their mind?

TL;DR: Can a swarm leave the hive without a queen, and then return to the same hive within the hour? 

UPDATE: Thanks to everyone who commented! Re-inspected and found that the hive was just as full as before, and two queen cells on the bottom of the frames on periphery of brood nest. May trigger a debate here on swarm v supercedure cells, but that says swarm cell to me. Bees subsequently swarmed ~10 days later; captured them and boxed them up. 

Lesson learned: Swarming can start earlier in mid-coast New South Wales than the literature suggests, and queenless 'false' swarms happen. ",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,True,,,True,t3_k5tkg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/k5tkg/a_queenless_swarm/,

What if I created some sort of cooler that ran off solar and a thermostat. How would that affect the bees during hot times? Would they have less girls on hive cooling duty, allowing them to be more productive? Would it suck the moisture out of uncapped honey? Could this idea really work? Would the bees seal it up? Would they recognize this as a convenience?

So I get home and search for 'solar powered bee hive' and sure enough, I wasn't the first person to think of this. Not only does this article answer all of my questions but it gives me design ideas: http://www.csmonitor.com/The-Culture/Gardening/diggin-it/2011/0224/Solar-powered-beehive-coolers-increase-yields     And here they are for sale (although I don't see a price anywhere) http://www.beecoolventilators.com/need.htm

1366241670.0,12,self.Beekeeping,1ckhsb,When cut outs don't exactly go right,brendhan,15,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/1ckhsb/when_cut_outs_dont_exactly_go_right/,"So today was the day we removed bees from a drain pipe along the bank of the canal. The drain pipe was part of an older system and wasn't in active use. 

The hive had been there for at least 3 months but not more than 6 months. This was one of those where the age of the hive was a factor but not a great one. The drain pipe went into one the many canal water ways that exist in south florida. They prevent sofla from becoming a swamp again. The pipe was about 10 feet from the top of the canal bank. Since the canal water level was low it was almost another 10 feet to the water line. 

The water was about 12 inches deep but the muck would suck you in for another 3 feet easy. The wall of the canal bank is basically sugar sand. When the survey was done it was noted the bees came with attitude. Just approaching the pipe caused them to not like you. 

We had set for today to do the removal. We knew this hive was a bit larger than some of the other drain pipe removals we had done. So we were going to do things a little different today. Some of those ideas worked. Others not so much. 

We had to dig back on the drain pipe and find the back part of the nest. That was done by shoveling the sand from the sides and top until a small pilot hole drilled in the top showed there was no more comb. It is important to note the sand on top of the pipe served a purpose for the hive that was a negative for us later in the cut out. 

The bees were not happy but after about 20 minutes just buzzed more than they actually stung us. I wore my veil for the initial bit and took it off later. Mike wore the jacket with the built in veil for the cut out. Mike probably lost 20 lbs in water weight. I did pretty well myself, but that is because I wore black. 

The plan of attack was to uncover the pipe and use a sawzall to cut the drain pipe and lift up the upper half and put it on saw horses and then cut and frame comb. 

My first factor is young comb does not stand up to vibrations well. It will collapse under the vibrations of a sawzall or a diamond blade. Old comb holds better. This works well as a rule of thumb with a hive on a tree limb. Note this a metal pipe, a rusty metal pipe. 

The digging and the cut went pretty well. It took 3 sawzall blades because of the thickness and angle of cut. All seemed to be ok. We decided to work on the canal bank when doing the final cut out. This was an incorrect decision also I will explain in a bit. 

Also did I mention it gets warm in south Florida? And things actually conduct heat in Sofla. 

So lets get to brass tacks. Rust is flaky and not the prime example of tensile strength in a metal. The vibrations from the sawzall did not cause the comb to break they caused the rust to separate from the pipe. The bees literally built their nest on a layer of rust. When we cut and lifted the the top half of the pipe most of it stayed in the lower  pipe. You could see the rust layer on the top of the comb. Some of the comb stayed with the pipe. We got about 50% of the hive to stay with the top half. 

So now we are in scramble mode to rescue the part of the comb left behind in the lower half. The upper half is on saw horses embedded in the bank of the canal. So we spend about a hour and half getting comb into frames and trying to rescue bees and vacuum them. Did I mention the sun?

The sun is now warming up the pipe sitting on the saw horses. A dark metal that is absorbing as much heat as fast as it can from our generous sofla sunlight. Did you know bees wax has a very low melt point. Literally as the finishing is being done on the comb in the lower half the upper half is starting fall off the upper piece. And as the commercial says but wait there is more. 

We decided to work the pipe on the canal bank because the upper area was next to a parking lot. We did not want people getting stung. However just as we are almost finished with the upper part of the pipe the sugar sand gives. The upper part and the last piece of comb fall into the canal. We rush and get it. Bring back up with a minimal loss. Just as we finish where we had dug out the pipe where the lower half remained the sugar sand had avalanched into the lower half. Fortunately most of the bees had been vacuumed out. We also believe we got the queen with the vacuum. 

What I would have done differently in hindsight is interesting. We could not cut with a diamond blade on an angle grinder ( no torches either- melts comb) the vibrations still would have caused the separation. However I would not work it in the sugar sand if I had the choice again. Getting the pipe up on the grass would have also meant about a 10 degree difference. I also would have tried to work it under a shade basis if possible. I may also have place rods through it before we lifted it and secured the rods to the upper half to move it up in one piece. 

The sand that covered the back end of the pipe also kept the pipe cool. I probably would use a sprayer with water to keep the pipe cool before during and after the cut. 

What did we lose? Probably about 100 lbs of honey and 20% of the hive population. What did we gain? A lotta wisdom about the next one. 
Even after all the years, I still learn.

tl;dr bees removed from pipe, sand and heat caused a lot of problems.

At my place in Austin, Texas, I live in harmony with two bee colonies who have made my house their home. Originally (3-4) years ago they built a hive with a low entrance behind one of our tool sheds. Shortly thereafter they sent off a swarm which made itself comfortable in the corner of my garage apartment. The bees seem to be hard working given the frequency of their swarms, as well as docile, having only been stung once by them. 

We would never kill or poison them, although we did think about getting them removed since from what I understand they will expand as much as possible. I was wondering if there was any possibility of farming these bees from their already established colonies, it would seem to be much more practical than anything else (removal, relocation, etc.).

We have houses all around us but all of them have big back yards. I was going to set up a hive in the far back corner of the property but it's near our swimming pool and our dog had reign of the entire yard. We do however have a sunroom with a relatively flat roof that can be accessed by the attic window.  I was considering using the roof as my area as it would be out of sight out of mind and away from the dog.  
  I was reading about people setting up rooftop hives and thought about doing it myself.  Any beekeepers out there with experience with rooftop vs backyard in a suburban setting?

I drove them home and despite knowing that they might be a little anxious from the jostling decided to install them right away.

Well, the unfortunate part is that my order for hive tool, smoker and suit still hasn't arrived.  So, this meant I was doing it au naturel.  The nucs were taped shut, so I cut the tape on the first, and opened away from me ... and all hell broke lose.  I held it together and remained calm.  I walked away and gave them a couple minutes, put on a pair of tight gloves, zipped up my collar, and slowly transferred the frames to my hive.  No sting.  There's probably 1000 or so bees buzzing all around that hive, so I'm going to wait an hour before opening the second one.

I didn't pause long enough to inspect the frames but I did notice that there was a tremendous amount of burr comb.  So much on one frame, that I had to take an extra out of the hive.  That's probably a mistake, should I put it back in when they calm down a little?

Any advice for a brand new bee keeper?




EDIT: Well, 30 minutes later it looks like it's nice and calm out there ... time to unleash fury number two!

My bee buddy, who so far has been too busy to show me how to do a proper inspection, says no. The dude I bought the nucs from (I have two hives) has all but disappeared, canceled monthly ""bee school"" three times now, but also said no, they'll find water. So I seem to be on my own.

I noticed today that they are stopping under the garden hose nozzle, which drips. So that's kinda good. Problem is, it's RIGHT outside my kitchen door, and on top of the recycling bin lid (of course it is! now I'll worry if every time I lift it I am crushing a bee...). 

Should I move the hose so it drips elsewhere, further away? Tighten it so it doesn't drip at all? It's not like they don't have water around here--I'm in a wooded area, and half a mile from a reservoir. And I'm trying to be an intervention-free beekeeper, i.e. no sugar water, no mite meds, etc. So a natural water source seemed the most preferable.

The population as a whole was only slightly less than when I checked at the start of May so it looks like things are about to get super busy.

What should I do?",Davin900,12,3,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/1iiiw1/queen_stopped_laying_so_confused_what_should_i_do/,"So I'm a first year beekeeper. I've got two hives. The first hive (Hive A) was doing really really well but then one day we were inspecting and we noticed several queen cells nearly complete. Other beekeepers had told me that if you see them you should just go ahead and scrape them off unless you need a queen for another hive. So I scraped them off.

As that inspection went on however we noticed that there was next to no brood in this hive. And then we panicked... We inspected everywhere and didn't see any evidence of a queen or the queen herself. So I put a brood frame from the other hive in to buy some time.

Called some other beekeepers, they said to get a new queen in ASAP. I ordered one from another state, had it overnighted for a whopping $60. Put her in last Friday along with more brood. Checked on the hive Monday and witnessed the bees attacking the new queen. Had no idea why but they weren't taking to her.

Fast forward to today! I'm doing another inspection, no sign of the new queen. I assume they've killed her. :-( But then on the very last frame of the bottom super, who do I see... THE OLD QUEEN! She's been alive the whole time! But still no brood!

So here are my questions:

1. Why did she stop laying? Could it be the heat? Does this just happen sometimes? Will she start again?

2. Should I remove her and spend more money on another new queen?

3. Should I cut my losses and just combine the two hives?",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,False,,,True,t3_1iiiw1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/1iiiw1/queen_stopped_laying_so_confused_what_should_i_do/,

A swarm one year, and 60+ lbs of honey two years in a row.  Last year my goal was to work the hive for most or all of the season without once wearing my gloves.  I'm a bit clumsy, and the gloves make things much harder for me.  Bad enough that I've nearly dropped frames because of the gloves.  So, it was very unfortunate that my Italian queen last year decided to be a real nasty bug.  Every time I got into that hive I immediately attracted a following of guard bees who would harass me the entire time I was working the hive.  I decided that she was getting replaced before the next season, no matter what.  

So I did a little research on the various types available to me, and settled on a Carniolan queen for this year.  They're supposed to be gentler than Italians, build up faster in the spring, good producers of honey surpluses, and, they like to swarm at the drop of a hat.  It is of course the last point that has me most worried.  

So, what advice do you have for a beekeeper moving from Italians to Carniolans? I'm actually installing a second hive this year, so will have two hives full of the little ladies for the first time.  Very exciting!  I just hope they don't all swarm off first thing.  I typically get into the hive for an inspection very regularly; once every 2 weeks and usually on a weekend.  Is this often enough with Carniolans?  I've heard that a swarm can issue even before the replacement queen is ready to hatch, and their cycle is 16 days from egg to hatching, so maybe I'm cutting it a little too close?

Now that I am a new home-owner, I can finally start to what maybe can become a new hobby and fascination for me.

I just recently have subscribed myself to a local beekeepers club, so I hope I can get some training and lessons there, but I still have a few questions for which I can't find an answer anywhere. So, I was hoping you guys could help me out a little.

first of all: **what time of the year is a good time to start a new colony**? My guess is that june, july are considered good months to start. If that's the case, I think I want to hold of keeping bees for another year to get some schooling and training done.

Which takes me to my second question: **how long does it normally take to be proficient enough to keep bees**? I want to be sure that I treat the bees with the respect and care they need; something I don't think will work if you have little knowledge about beekeeping.

Thirdly: I'm confident that bees can thrive in almost any environment. Currently we see more and more urban beekeepers which all have success stories about thriving bee colonies. Now I do not live in an dense urban area myself, but I do live near a highway (well close enough for bees anyway) and close to a fairly large lake.
([link to google maps: city centre of where I live](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=linkhout&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=50.968103,5.136881&amp;spn=0.046539,0.126514&amp;geocode=+&amp;hnear=Linkhout,+Limburg,+Flemish+Region,+Belgium&amp;t=h&amp;z=14)) and I read that a large body of water could be troublesome for fatigued bees when they return, fully loaded, to their colonies. Is this something I should bare in mind? **Does a large body of water or a highway close to the beehive have an effect on the population of the bees? More specifically: is the given location good, good enough, or bad**?

Finally I was wondering **what would happen if you don't harvest the honey**? Do you still need to feed them with sugar water? Would they have a higher/lower tendency to swarm? The reason I ask this is because my main motivation for keeping bees is not to harvest the honey, but to create healthy colonies of Apis mellifera bees which are native to where I live.

Built my own golden mean hive. Got a swarm last night, put it in today. They absconded and swarmed on a branch. I cut off this branch and put it in the hive. Then I saw another cluster around the size of a grapefruit. I cut this off and put it in the hive as well. 

Now they seem to finally be settling in to their new home. However, the hive is full of branches. I can see this being a major problem if they build comb quickly and entangle the branches. I want to get in there right away and take it out however I already spent much of the  morning trying to get them to stay and am worried that they are already stressed enough. 

I received advice from an expert to whom I relayed this story that I should wait 3 days before taking the branches out. But there is a lot of branch in there and I saw on someone's top bar blog that their bees built a top to bottom comb in one day. What do you all think? How much comb can I expect in 3 days and will pulling these branches out wreak havoc then?

My friend picked me up 6 deep used boxes /w some frames for the amazing cheap price of $30. the boxes look rough but *okay.*  There are a bunch of old frames with plastic foundation, and some frames have old black gross looking comb. On inspection, I spotted a couple of small worms or grubs retreating into holes in the damaged parts of the grungy comb. Also there are about 40 or so dead bees head first in the cells of another frame.

Am I right in assuming something bad happened in the hive(s) and the old comb is likely not safe to use? Would it be ok to remove all the old black comb and put fresh foundation in the frames, or might evil still be lurking in the wood? Does anyone know what the little worms/grubs might be? possibly moth larva? Any other thoughts /stories about ""bargain"" beekeeping equipment?

A few days ago I posted my queen bee lament [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/iqipl/where_oh_where_could_she_bee/).

On Friday, I quickly opened the hive to finish adding the remainder of the fames to the new super and managed to get all in except for two.  Between Monday afternoon and Friday, they'd filled the space where these frames were supposed to go with amazing burr comb.  They work so fast!  I didn't have my smoker or brush with me so decided I'd go back on the weekend to make space.

That brings us to today.  I'd decided ahead of time that I wouldn't ""inspect"" the bottom super, only have a look through the new frames to see if I could spot eggs.  Not only did I spot tons and tons of eggs but...I spotted the queen!  And damn, isn't she a pretty one!

The comparison photos I've been looking at really don't do justice to how different from the others she really looks.

Next weekend I need to go into the bottom super and harvest one of the honey frames - one of the two honey frames that were a part of the nuc.  Last weekend it was so heavy that I could barely lift it and it was starting to get so big that it was merging with one of the ones beside it.  It's been recommended to me to harvest the honey from one side only so I'll give that a try.

My plan so far, and research is continuing:
  Start collecting materials for building 3 top bar hives.
  One set of top bars will be modified as cut out frames.
  Hive one, will be ready for purchased bees.
  Hive two, will be ready for a possible cut out.
  Hive three, will be ready for whatever opportunity pops up, ie.
  cut out, swarm collection, perhaps a second purchase.
  The only commercial equipment I plan to buy, is a suit, and a smoker.

My city requires hives to be 30ft, from any property line, and signed permission from immediate neighbors.

Therefore, I hope to rely on friend and family for placing my hives.
My brother has a small property,  and is unafraid of bees.
He keeps a small tank for growing aquatic plants, but mostly maintains it because of the huge traffic of bees that use this as a source of water. Often, in a dry year, any available dry surface on this tank is covered with bees and wasps collecting water.
**Question** could there be benefits or problems from this bee traffic for my hive/hives.(should I check a few of these bees for mites?)
I have two additional prospects for hive locations:
A friend is starting a [CSA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-supported_agriculture) and this could be great for both of us. This property also has an existing bee tree from which I hope to catch possible swarms.
Some other friend have a small nursery, on a larger acreage, which is very close to my brothers property.
I don't think I will have a problem finding convenient places to place hives.

I plan to start small, and if I like it, the hope is to grow it gradually from any sale of honey, or by products. (self supporting hobby, I hope)

Additionally, there is at least one beekeeper, in my area and I plan to contact him after the holiday confusion settles down. I know he used to have a retail location that was bee related, mostly selling honey, and beeswax crafts. I no longer see a store front, but he is still using the business name. (I assume he had a fairly large operation)

I will post things related to this endeavor in this thread from time as needed. Any advice, or information will be greatly appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,False,,,True,t3_eq1c1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/eq1c1/i_am_going_to_start_beekeeping/,

After recently joining Reddit, driven by the recommendations of many friends and useful things that I have found here, I may as well become involved in the subreddit of my passion: Beekeeping.

I was first exposed to Beekeeping when serving as an Agriculture Volunteer with the US Peace Corps in The Gambia (2011-2013).  I loved it there.  I came back to SF Bay area in January '13 and started building my hive numbers on a shoestring budget.  I currently manage 11.  That's enough for a serious hobbyist.

I'm wanting and willing to expand to 40-50 in the 2014 season.  I have a really good idea about how to bring top-bar beekeeping to the USA as a economically viable way to beekeep.  I am going to incorporate some of the wisdoms shared by Wyatt Mangum, Ph. D (check out www.tbhsbywam.com)  into my own beekeeping practices.  I have a vision plan to eventually pollinate with Top-Bar hives.

for those beekeepers who are reading this, I recognize that a top-bar centered operation is a different method of beekeeping than more than 95% of US beekeepers.  But I have seen it work in developing countries and I would liketo bring those lessons and wisdoms home to the USA.

Finally what I am asking people on this subreddit to do is explore my kickstarter webpage at http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/625857222/beehives-for-the-hercules-community-garden/

And watch my video.  I am happy to share all that I know about beekeeping with this community.

3) which means if we DID take the bees, we would really only be able to take the bees themselves and no comb / stores. 

Is this even reasonable? I can't find a way in my head that even sort if makes sense, even if we end up having a super mild spent again. 

I'd love to bring the whole hives over as is, but I'd hate to accidentally spread some unknown disease unwittingly. I know the laws are in place for good reasons (well probably).

We have an educational bee hive set up and recently the Hive died after being functional and healthy for about 5 months. I was hoping to explain what our hive setup is like and if anyone has any ideas as to why this may have happened and if there is anything glaring about our setup that may have contributed to the failure of the hive. 
Basically our setup is that the Bee Hive is indoors with a 1 ft. pipe that is through the wall to the outside on the 2nd story. The bee box is actually made of plexiglass so that children and adults alike can actually see the working hive. The building temperature is a stable 63-65 degrees every single day. The lights are turned off at night though sometimes the cleaning crew has them on until late. We do not cover it at night but maybe this is something we should have done. The box has plenty of room inside of it with sheets for combs as well as a sugar water dispenser that is easily excessible. Our facility is in a temperate california climate and I believe we most likely lost the queen while it was still beautiful outside. We noticed the numbers slowly decreasing untli there was only a few live bees left by last week. The hive survived for about 4-5 months before this actually happened. I have no idea if there is anything that we could have done differently. We have a bee keeper who is a little off(aren't we all) and isn't the most social person. He was great about checking the hive every couple of weeks and when it failed said that it happens and he didn't really have any answers. I think he's great but I was just hoping for, I don't know, some kind of advice or really anything that may help. Thanks and if you have questions I'm more than happy to answer them.

Catch a swarm, or ask a friendly beekeeper for a swarm or split (a few frames of brood and food, perhaps with a young queen). Your new colony will be quite small and not too intimidating for the fresh new beekeeper, so inspections are easy. They might need feeding, but will manage fine on their own overall.

After observing them all summer long, you'll have to make sure they will survive winter (enough food, healthy, varroa treatment etc). And then you'll use the winter to learn more about beekeeping, which will be a lot easier, because you have some practical experience.

When spring comes, you have a colony (hopefully) and can start doing the grownup beekeeper's stuff and go for the honey. And when your colony didn't survive, you can buy bees like you intended to do anyways, but you'll have almost a year beekeeping experience by then.

I've done extensive research and still have a few questions, I'm hoping reddit can help.

 * Space: the hive is about 4 feet long and will most likely be quite spacious for my initial package of bees (3lbs). Do I need to make a separator and extend the bee's space as the colony grows?

 * Ventilation: right now the only way that air will get in the hive is through the entrace and the tiny spaces between the bars (which I understand bees will glue). I'm reading mixed advice on what to do for ventilation. What should I do? Is this any different during the cold winter months of New Englans?

 * Entrance reducer: by how much should I reduce the entrace and for how long initially?

 * Hive placement: the spot I'm looking at is fairly wooded with an apple orchard. Should I maximize space around the hive? do bees prefer shade or sun? should I try to find a field instead? What if said field gets harvested for hay? And again, is placement any different during a cold winter?

When I expressed an interest in starting up a hobby hive (no plans to sell honey or wax, just use it myself and share with family and friends), he recommended I read up on the Jackson-style hive. I understand that the benefit of this type of hive is that it combines the simplicity, flexibility, and minimal start-up investment of a top bar, while utilizing traditional Langstroth frames so that honey can be easily harvested and separated from the comb (my friend has the extraction equipment that I can use).

I do have a few questions:

* I've read that most Jackson keepers use full-size brood frames, but elsewhere I've seen that these larger frames are not ideal for honey because of the weight. Is this a legit concern?

*  Part of the appeal of the TBH is that the top bars are wide enough that when they are butted together, the form a ""ceiling"" for the hive, while still allowing bee space so that the bees will create comb along the bars and not across them. Is there conventional wisdom for ""filling"" the gap at the top between the Lang frames when used in this configuration, or does it just end up being a single-layer, oversize Langstroth hive with gaps between the frames?

First winter as a beek and damn, I miss my girls!

I'm stopping by the hive about once a week right now, just to have a quick look, clear off the lower entrance platform and stick my ear in the upper entrance to listen to their low hum,

To my eyes, each time I go, there are a fair number of dead bees on the entrance plantform and right below it on the skunk board.  A rought estimate would be 20-30 or so per week.

Is this normal?  About half of the dead bees are in a desicated condition so my guess is that these ones have died in the hive and were brought out when the weather was warm enough for some housecleaning.  The other half are in perfect condition so perhaps they are the ones that stepped outside for some fresh air and the cold was too much?

So far Vancouver has had a very warm winter and a drier than normal one as well.  Daytime temperatures reach about 6-8C and at night it hasn't dropped below 3-4C in quite some time.

When I was up there last week, it was a sunny day and about 8C.  A few of the girls were out sunning themselves and it was lovely to have one of them hang out on my hand for a bit!

Towards the end of next week there are predictions that we're going to have highs of 10C.  If there is a dry day at that temperature, would it be safe for me to open the hive and have a look or should I just leave them the heck alone?

I realize that it's a bit early for an oxalic treatment, but with the mite drop I was still having after formic, I was afraid I was going to lose my girls over the winter.  I'd also double checked and there was no brood in the hive.

The oxalic was done via drizzling a week ago - the standard 50ml from a syringe.

Friday last week (6 days after oxalic) was the first time I was able to stop by the hive after treatment.  It was pouring rain, and much to my horror, there were dead bees on the entrance platform and skunk board.  I felt absolutely sick.

There I was in the bucketing rain, in the almost dark, on my knees in the mud, trying to get a look into the entrance to make sure there was movement.  Yes, I lean towards the dramatic!  Looking back at me was a large number of little black eyes, so I chilled out about the possiblity that I killed my entire hive!

I then took the time to count the dead bees and there was 28.

Since it was a sunny day, I went back again on Saturday to clean off the mite board and put a new layer of grease down.

Holy bee bottoms! I have never seen that [many](http://i.imgur.com/nYyR2.jpg) mites in my life!  It appears that the oxalic did a real number on the little [buggers](http://i.imgur.com/8UVdk.jpg).

I started last April with a 4' long top bar hive I built and a 4lb package of bees.   It went pretty well but I have had to contend with a fair amount of cross combing, I have found a big bread knife sure helps when working the TBH.   I also had very good luck with feeding syrup in gallon size ziplock bags with a few small slits for the first few weeks the hive was getting established.

I took a pretty hands off approach and only harvested about 30lb. of honey through the last part of the summer.  They did well and filled the entire hive, they have a ton of honey to get through winter so I am hopeful I can split the hive this coming spring.

The main thing I have learned here is that the bees know exactly what to do, and staying out of their way is one of the best things to do.  I just ordered 3 more boxes of bees and will be placing some hives on a farm a few miles from my home this spring.  I still have to figure out if I want to do Top Bar Hives or attempt the standard lang hives.

Long Lane is a supplier in my region and it struck me to try this. What they said about heat and condensation traps made a lot of sense. Since this summer was the first time I've used screened bottom boards (and LOVED them) I was wondering what to do with them in the winter. 

After much debate about whether or not to replace it with an old solid, I've decided to leave my screen on for the winter. I was able to fit a thicker hollowfill piece of plastic (it looks like corrugated cardboard but it's white plastic) in where the varroa-counting grid went.

Seeing as my girls' house has  a partial windbreak, I was thinking to tape shut the slot where the plastic went in so the wind doesn't whip through it. Maybe pin prick some drainage holes in the lowermost-tipped part of the plastic itself?

Any advice or folks in cold climates who've left screens on all winter? What were your preparations and experiences?

However, I have a few questions...

1.  I wanted to build my own hive, and I have found some plans.  I was originally going to cut the lumber myself and build it from scratch, but started wondering about hive kits.  What would you recommend?  I am perfectly comfortable with my skills in terms of cutting/assembling the hive myself.

2.  In terms of the frames, what sort of foundation do you prefer?  I've heard that manufactures foundations aren't the best for the bees since they have uniform sizes.  What are the other options?  Can I place completely bare frames (no honeycomb or foundation) in my soon-to-be-hive, and have success?

3.  Do you ever catch your own swarms?  Buy nucs?  Where do you get your bees?

4.  What are some helpful tips or tricks that I should be mindful of?

Thanks for all the feedback, any suggestions will be greatly appreciated!  I also plan on photographically documenting the process as I build/grow my hive!

tl;dr I want to start a bee hive, but have quite a few questions!

2) What are the best treatments for mites?

I have a top bar hive that I check on yesterday. The bees seemed pretty slow, much less activity than before, and I noticed some debris that had been pushed up between the bars in the center of the hive. Could this be wax wing moths? I know I had some last year, after my hive collapsed. What would be the best solution to this? I was hesitant about diving in and opening the whole hive before I knew what to do. Any ideas?

Thanks.

Came across [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/wrqiz/midair_bee_collision/) in r/funny today and it gave me a much needed laugh!

It was a pretty stressful spring: split done to prevent swarming, the parent hive swarmed anyways, queenless in both my hives for way too long and queens unmated for way too long.  

Everything was looking great in both hives two weeks ago with very healthy queens in both and laying like mad, but when I checked on my bigger hive today, the queen was no where to be found, no eggs and no larvae with a scattered capped brood pattern.

Thankfully there is one queen cell in the works (capped and starting to get nice and long) in the big hive and my small hive is still doing really well.

A laugh though is always appreciated! :o)",,False,self,t5_2qtzm,False,,,True,t3_wsvc3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Beekeeping/comments/wsvc3/much_needed_laugh/,
