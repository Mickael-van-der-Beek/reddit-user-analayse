1347772466.0,495,self.IWantOut,zykw2,Getting Out and What It Means To Me.,Wrongdonald,618,123,418,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/zykw2/getting_out_and_what_it_means_to_me/,"So I've spent 4 of the past 5 years out of the US.  At first, I was bitter because I did what everyone told me I should do:  go to college, get good grades, save your money, meet a girl, get a job.  I, like many of you, was unfulfilled and I didn't understand why, because again, I did what everyone thought was the smart thing to do.  My job options sucked, so I got out.  

I got out for two years, and it was the time of my life.  The best friends I have I met then.  It was, at the time, a truly miserable experienced.  I ""got out"" to one of those countries that is so fucked up, it probably won't continue to be a country much longer.  I was poor, I was sick, I was scared.  I was alive.  

I spent a year in the US, recovering from that.  I got a nice office job on salary, my girlfriend moved in, I bought a dog (Duckie).  Then it started to drag, and it started to suck.  The dog died (parvo, which I didn't even know was a thing, until it was too late) and so did I.  I got out again.
  
I went to paradise and learned it wasn't all it's cracked up to be.  I found myself in one of the most naturally beautiful places this planet has conjured, and I watched millions of poor, uneducated hedonists mess it up beyond repair.  I tell my friends they should go now, because in 10 years, all its charm and beauty will have washed away.  I was poor, I was scared, and I hated the job that sponsored me.  
When I think about it now, I'm sad because I will never have it that good again, at least with enough youth to enjoy it.  

At home, things were either grey, old and decaying or that new, shiny white they paint on school and hospital walls that allows no humanity to spill or stain them.  Everything was either old and decrepit or new and hostile.  I saw a lot of pain and weariness in the eyes of my friends and family, especially those who lead the same life as when I got out for the first time.  

Still, I gave it a shot.  It was home, it was safe, and I could make it work.  Or at least, I tell myself that I could make it work.  That's a gamble that means all of your chips are on the hand that says your future happiness exists in Smalltown, USA.  That boasts, your future happiness is attainable, affordable easy, and all you have to do is sign right here.  I read the news, I saw the town and I read the eyes.  After two interviews with people who hated their own jobs, I realized that they probably resented their families.  If they hated their job and their families, they were miserable.  I realized that if they hate their jobs, at a minimum, they'll make me hate mine.  I got out again.

I find myself in a new, strange place.  I'm in the ""honeymoon phase"", so it's all exciting, vibrant and new.  I'm a child here, so it's filled with wonder.  I'm alive, wide-eyed and joyful.  

I got out to know myself.  It's the most profound and important advice anyone has ever given me and I consider myself cosmically fortunate it was given to me enough times to stick.  I saw that for me, getting out was a way to further my knowledge, my independence and my contribution to this world.  Each time I've gotten out, I've returned smarter, healthier, with a deeper sense of spirit and purpose.  I avoided becoming a statistic by getting out.  

However, my first mistake was bitterness.  You can't rage-quit your country.  I didn't know then, but I know now:  there is no holy grail.  No country on Earth is without flaws, annoyances, inefficiencies or pointless bureaucracy.  There will be things you love and things you hate about any place you go, if you don't think that's true, you haven't been there long enough.  

For me, about 3 months is the honeymoon phase, and after that the small annoyances start to pile up and calcify.  I think that's why vagabonding (if you want out and you haven't read that book, you're wasting everyone's time, including yours.  It's by Rolf Potts.) is such a popular way to get out:  you experience the hot, passionate romance of exploring a new place without the frustrating, dirty, or brutal sacrifices of a long-term relationship.  It's getting out as a summer fling, not as a serious relationship.  

The long-term is what I have left to discover.  I've yet to ""seduce"" a country into letting me stay there forever, and I may never.  This may be my last trip ""out"" and that will be fine with me.  Before I make another leap of faith, lugging my life around in two heavy bags, I will appreciate my own home.  I will give the US another go, and from the sounds of a lot of these informational requests, many of you should do the same.  I still believe that you can lead any kind of life you want there, but it requires a great deal of sacrifice, effort and dedication.  Sounds a lot like the price of freedom, to me.  

If I do become a full-time expat, it's not out of bitterness, philosophical protest, or spite.  It's because I'll dedicate my life and career to the search, to the road and to the wind.  It's because that's how I feel alive, when I am watching the world zip by through a window.  That window, on a bus, a plane, a train, a car, or just out of the corner of my eye is how I want to live and die.  That's where my soul thrives, watching the world whip past.  I hope my current ""outing"" will answer if that's the path that awaits me.  

In closing, don't get out due to desperation, anger or disgust.  Your unhappiness will follow you, plague you and consume you.  Get out because you are passionate, curious, or excited to share yourself.  Get out because your comfort zone ends when you hand over a boarding pass.  Get out because that's when life puts you at your best.  Get out because getting out is the story you will tell your grandchildren.  Get out because the road beckons you in a way that you feel deeply, in a way that moons beckon wolves and the tides, or in a way that you know, while it will not always be easy, exciting or fun, it was impossible to resist.  Get out because it gives your senses purpose, your mind an edge and your soul a challenge.  Get out because you want out, down to the cells in your bones, for all kinds of reasons, good and bad.  Get out, and hopefully, I'll see you there.

1303822189.0,232,self.IWantOut,gxqar,"I have gotten out, and out, and out (currently on my 4th country 8 years later) - a few tips",shinjirarehen,262,30,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gxqar/i_have_gotten_out_and_out_and_out_currently_on_my/,"I just found out about this subreddit and spent some time looking through threads. I left the US 8 years ago and have since lived in 4 countries on 3 continents long-term, complete with visas and jobs, with no special help (financially or family connections, etc). Now I feel like the whole world is open to me, and I truly believe most people can do this if they want to. I've learned a couple things along the way.

* Get a college degree! I am the first person to admit that the US has many many problems and fails at many things, but it's still true that if you can do it without taking massive loans, a degree from the good US university is top-class. US degrees have worldwide credibility, and many countries have immigration requirements that make it much easier to get a visa if you have a degree (in anything), and for some it's nearly impossible without one. If you can get a master's even better! If you can study abroad for a year while getting your degree, do it - best way to learn the language and make connections in a new country, and make sure it's really for you.

* Take advantage of organized programs if you don't have many ties in another country yet. There are so many - Working Holiday (US citizens can work in NZ and Aus *super* easily, Canadians have even more options), JET program, WOOFing, Fulbright and other fellowships, study abroad/exchange, volunteering/peace corps/etc. Having a structured way to start is a great first step and you'll be able to go on independently after that.

* Learn the language! If you're aiming for somewhere that doesn't speak your native language, learn the local one. This is something you can work on while preparing to make your move. People say English is the international language, and while many people do speak it everywhere, what's important while job hunting is the language of local business. If you're up for a job against someone who has the language and you don't, you're going to miss out. Also, if you don't learn the language you're very likely to get stuck in an expat bubble in your new country. It's a huge challenge, but don't be lazy - do it!

* Do NOT mess around with laws, visas, taxes, etc. Don't try to game the system. Don't sneak around. Yes, visas are one of the biggest headaches known to man. Yes, tax and legal systems can be amazingly complicated, especially in another country. But if you screw up, it will come back to haunt you. If you get caught trying to dodge getting a proper visa, it's likely you will get banned from the country you wanted so much to go to. If you lie to an employer about your visa status you are shooting yourself in the foot for future employment. Not worth it! Do your research and fulfil the visa requirements. Be realistic. Even if it takes a long time, and requires endless paperwork, walk the straight and narrow if you're serious about making a life in a new country.

* Don't underestimate culture shock. You will grow as a person and learn so much, but there are huge challenges. Even going from the US to the UK/Europe or Australia, while on the surface it might seem very similar compared with Africa or Asia, can be deceptively challenging. Sometimes when things are superficially similar is actually a bigger shock because when you scratch the surface you find out things are subtly different in profound ways you never expected. Learn about the culture shock process and allow yourself to experience its ups and downs without getting frustrated at either yourself for not adapting or your new home for not being what you expected. It's all part of the experience! Also, don't be surprised when the novelty wears off and you find you've simply traded whatever problems you were escaping for a new set of problems and a change of scenery. There is a downside to every place, but learning about the world through your own experience is its own reward.

* Make the effort to keep up with people important to you, both back home and those you meet in your travels. Be aware that if you're leaving family and old friends, you are the one removing yourself from the equation and you bear the burden to keep in touch, especially if you're moving around a lot and hard to catch. It's so easy to let important people slip away, but much as you may want to get out, there is simply no replacement for family and old friends. Something you only realize only after getting way way far away is how precious it is to have someone who understands your background implicitly (language, culture, etc) to talk to when things are rough or you need perspective. Just keep mind they may never fully understand your new experiences and don't hold it against them. The new people you meet are great sources of info, advice, and couches to sleep on when you visit their countries! Some people I've met traveling I thought I'd never see again, but ended up becoming very important to me after life takes unexpected turns. Keep up your facebook, etc because you never know! 

* Keep a US address, bank account, and drivers license if at all possible, because it really comes in handy sometimes, and they are very hard to get back once you let them go if you're not physically there. Also, don't forget to vote absentee and file your US tax returns (even though you're likely not going to need to pay anything if you're not earning in the US). A huge benefit to being an ex-pat is having a foot in each world, so don't give up your US presence while building your new one overseas.

If anyone has any tips like these to add, please do! Or if anyone has questions for someone who got out and just kept going, feel free.

EDIT to add a big one I forgot to mention:

* Don't be attached to your *stuff*! Multiple times in my life I have sold everything until my life fit in a suitcase (or even just a backpack) and it is the most freeing feeling. I have moved internationally so many times, and no matter how much I thought I cut it down, inevitably I get to the other side and think ""ugh, I really didn't need half this crap"".

I'm passionate about expatriate life and I want very much for people (Americans like myself in particular) to achieve their goal of experiencing another culture. It makes me proud to talk to another American who has gotten out and I love dishing out advice to aspiring expats. 

That's the problem with a lot of the posters here though. They're not aspiring expats, they're people sick of their jobs, bored with their hometown or just bored with life in general. **This is not a good reason to move overseas.**

Living in another country is an exhilarating, frustrating, difficult and character-building experience, **not an escape hatch**. To the potential posters of IWantOut, please know that if you're unhappy in your life now, you're going to be unhappy abroad as well. If you're broke here, you'll be broke there as well. 

Moving overseas doesn't immediately make you Julia Roberts in *Eat Pray Love*. That's not how it works. Your motivating factors in moving abroad ought to be internal rather than external. Get out because you need to live overseas to (experience my grandfather's country/learn Chinese/follow my love/etc) not because you're trying to escape your (bad job/debt/depression). 

The playful title of this subreddit does my cause no favours — but that's because I think those of us who live abroad can get a chuckle out of the idea that you just hold up the sign like the little reddior man in the logo and get out. We know facetiousness of that cartoon. Aspring expat do not.

###DISCLAIMER  
I worked as a legal assistant for an immigration lawyer in Canada so I'm fairly familiar with our immigration system, but *please* consider this to be as reliable as Wikipedia: a good starting place, but not legal advice or guaranteed accurate. I would hate for anyone to trust that everything below is totally accurate and be disappointed as a result. I'm happy to edit this post as time goes on - comment any feedback!  

###IS CANADA A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE?  
It has its flaws (domestic and international travel is expensive if you're used to Europe, our winter is quite cold, etc.), but overall yes. For the most part, Canada has:  

* Friendly, polite, accepting people
* The most diverse population of any country in the world (really!)
* Low crime (visitors are surprised that flower shops often leave all the flowers out overnight unprotected)
* High quality of life (good food, culture, etc.)
* Huge natural beauty and a love of the outdoors (more than almost anywhere else on earth)
* Acceptable labour laws (much better than America, especially for minimum wage employees)
* Excellent customer service (People who work in shops and restaurants, etc., are generally much friendlier here than anywhere else I've been - probably related to previous point)

It's certainly not a perfect country, but I've travelled to ~30 countries and lived in four, and Canada is the only one I'd want to live in permanently. That said, you should definitely visit first! Canada is the second-largest country on Earth, and cities/regions are extremely different from each other: Canada has deserts, cities, farming areas, rainforests, fishing villages, suburbs, mountains, hundreds of islands, and more. I'll talk about my impressions of major locations of interest at the bottom of the post.  

###HOW DO I IMMIGRATE TO CANADA?  
As is the case with almost every country on earth, you can't move to Canada without special permission from our government. There's no point getting too excited about Canadian life or spending a great deal of time discussing it if, in practice, you have no claim to Canadian residency. Step one is finding your local Canadian embassy/consulate/high commission, wherever you are. [This](http://www.international.gc.ca/ciw-cdm/embassies-ambassades.aspx?view=d) is the complete list of websites for Canadian foreign offices in every country that has one. Their staff and website will be of enormous assistance to you, and details (mostly about the third program) may vary depending on where you're from. They can help.

Without further ado, the three main ways to live in Canada for more than a month or two, ranked from hardest to easiest:

* As a [Temporary Foreign Worker](http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/eng/workplaceskills/foreign_workers/index.shtml). Requires a job offer from a Canadian employer in advance. Unless your skills are in high demand or you have a strong international reputation for your work, it is difficult but not imposible to find a sponsored job here. Part of the process is that the employer has to demonstrate that a foreign employee is necessary for some reason (i.e. shortage of domestic employees in the field) - they must prove that the job was advertised substantially within Canada and that they were unable to fill it.  

* As a [Federal Skilled Worker](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/index.asp). There are three streams of this: PhD students studying in Canada, those with an offer of employment, or those without an offer of employment but with experience in a ""Priority Occupation"" (i.e., something Canada needs more of). Here's a 2010 version of [that list](http://www.visabureau.com/canada/priority-occupation-list.aspx). There's no current version available because applications are temporarily closed for the Priority Occupation category until some time in early 2013 when rules may be changing. For FSW applicants, they grade your application out of 100. Anyone who gets above a 67 is generally accepted, on a first-come, first-serve basis until quotas for each category are filled. Here's [a sample test](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/assess/index.asp) that can help you estimate what grade out of 100 you'd score. It'll ask how many years of full-time experience you have in an occupation with NOC codes of 0, A or B. To work out what qualifies, find your job [here](http://www5.hrsdc.gc.ca/noc/english/noc/2011/SearchAlphabetical.aspx) (there's a search box too, bottom left sidebar) and if the 4-digit code starts with 0, or the second digit is 0, 1, 2 or 3, it counts for this question. For any category of FSW, you need at least one year of *full-time, paid* experience in a job that meets this regulation (starts with 0, or second digit 0/1/2/3). You'll get points for how well you speak our official languages - you only need to speak one, but you get more points if you have even some skills in the other (English and French). If your application is just below the 67 mark, take basic French lessons for a month.

* [International Experience Canada](http://www.international.gc.ca/experience/intro_incoming-intro_entrant.aspx?lang=eng&amp;view=d) (Working Holiday). Every year, thousands of people age 18-35 (age requirements may be more strict in some countries) can come live *and work* in Canada for up to 12 months. This is basically first-come, first-serve and NO QUALIFICATIONS ARE NEEDED. You can live and work anywhere in Canada, no limits, for 12 months, and do not need an employment offer in advance - it's up to you to find work. **Applications will be opening within the next few weeks for 2013** and they are always filled quite quickly (within a few weeks/months). Each participating country is allocated a specific number of spaces per year  - check with your local Canadian foreign office for your country's info, or it should be on their website too. You may be able to reapply for further 12 month periods if you wish, but this is not guaranteed - speak with your Canadian embassy for details, as each participating country has different policies about reapplying.  

##Alternative: Study in Canada

* Canada also receives 1000s of international students every year. [This page](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/study/study-who.asp) has all the details about how to study in Canada. I won't get into what universities are good and bad, but in my opinion, Canadian universities are very good quality, and cheap for international students compared to American or British schools (~$9,000-20,000 CAD per year for tuition). This is still quite expensive, which is why I don't list it as a standard method of coming to Canada. All you need is proof that you have been accepted to a Canadian educational institution, proof that you have enough money for school and living and return to your home after, no criminal record, and generally good health. There is no limit or quota for this program - Canada can accept all students who meet these requirements. You may be able to be employed while in Canada as a student, and the website linked has details on that too. After graduating, you can live in Canada for 3 more years and [may be eligible for permanent residency and citizenship after that](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/study/work-postgrad.asp).  

###WHERE SHOULD I LIVE?
Canada is the second-largest country on Earth (after Russia). Although we are larger than the US, our population is approximately 10%. Approximately 75% of Canadians live within 160km (100 miles) of the US border. Brief comments about some popular cities:

* Toronto: I'm from here and therefore biased. Largest city, pop. 5.6m. Built on a very large lake, over 100 parks, over 100 libraries, great nightlife, lots of culture, busy city. 

* Montréal: Extremely beautiful island city in Québec, pop. 3.8m. Hard but not impossible to find work here without good French. Historic city, with best nightlife in Canada and best arts scene. Relatively low cost of living. 

* Vancouver: Hosted 2010 Winter Olympics, pop. 2.3m. Expensive but great place to live. Big city, surrounded by Rocky Mountains and ocean. Fantastic for outdoor-lovers.

* Ottawa: Our capital, pop. 1.2 million. Major employer is government. Must visit while you're here as it's beautiful and the capital, but can be hard to find work - not recommended to move here unless seeking government work and/or you're bilingual.

* Calgary: Home to Canada's resource extraction industry, pop. 1.2m. Possibly the easiest place to find employment due to rapid economic growth, but not a very exciting place to live. (Sorry, Calgary.)

* Halifax, Charlottetown or St. John's: Some of the nicest small cities are in Atlantic Canada. Can be friendlier/easier to get to know. 

*A note about language:* Canada has two official languages, English and French. To immigrate, you will need good language skills in one language, but not necessarily both. Canadians use English in all areas of Canada except the province of Québec and some parts of the province of New Brunswick. (Outside of these areas, only 1 in 10 Canadians can have a conversation in French!) If you do not live in either of these places, English is normal and you will never need any French at all. 

###HOW DO I GET A JOB IN CANADA?
The answer to this varies depending on what job you're looking for, where, and your experience, but most employers will want a résumé listing your past jobs/experience/education, and a cover letter - same as in the US. The letter should introduce yourself and explain why you think you would be good for that specific job, ending with information about how to contact you. If the job is minimum wage (retail/food/etc.), the tone of the letter should be professional but friendly - Canada is casual compared to Europe, but a little more formal than the US, if that helps. Job websites in Canada include www.monster.ca www.craigslist.ca and www.kijiji.ca but there are many more.",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,1358721635.0,,,True,t3_14f1j1,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14f1j1/the_friendly_canucks_big_guide_to_how_to_get_in/,moderator

I got a job as an English teacher in Central Kalimantan (middle of the jungle!). It's voluntary but I'll still get paid a little. It'll definitely be enough to make a living there. I found a house, I'll be living close to some of my friends. 

Indonesia feels like home to me, I also have family living in Jakarta, I've been there a few times before.

I'm currently in the middle in the process of getting a visa, but even if that doesn't work out I'll still be able to enter the country and get a visa there. 

I've been working around 50 hrs a week on a crappy minimum wage job for what seemed like ages to be able to pay for my ticket. And it's all been worth it!

i am a 35 year old man from Israel. i am married with a perfect 2.5 year old boy and one on the way. i am currently working in a very large company (3500 employees) as a CTO in charge of integrating and implementing storage, Vurtalization and storage systems for large scale companies.

 i have more than 20 years of hands on and management experience in the field but unfortunately these days it is even hard to finish the month. the fuel is 8.4 $ a gallon the electricity for a 3 bedroom apartment (very small) is around 250-300$ a month. the water and city taxes are through the roof. the monthly payment for my kids kindergarden (5 hours a day) is around 500$ and although my salary is above average, we are struggling. my situation is better than most families and although my wife was against moving to another country, she has finally decided that enough is enough.


people tell me that living abroad is not the perfect life:

- you will have antisemitism (not like here were people are trying to kill you from left and right).
- you will not be able to save a dime (but at least i will be able to live a normal life) 
- your kid will never know what it is to be an Israeli (these days i think it is only a plus). in fact i don't feel like an Israeli any longer.

i can contribute to any IT company and will be a very valuable employee but i would appreciate anyone who is looking for an CTO or and IT Senior personal that will take the chance but will never regret it.
if you cant help me, i would appriciate if you can upvote this request so more people will see it. thank you in advance and i hope i will be able to post in the future the following headline ""REDDIT changed me and my family's life forever) :)


EDIT 1: sorry - forgot to complain about 2 more things. 1) the nice Iran war in a few months. then it will be very nice to live here 2) we will never ever ever be able to buy a house. for a 4 bedroom apartment the price here is around 580k$
thank you for the upvotes :)
BTW the avarage paycheck here is around 1900$ and rent is around 800-1000$, 8.4$ per gallon and mcdonald meal is around 7-10$


Edit 2 - thank you all for your replies.
i love reddit even more now - all the people here taking the time to help me and suggest advice is priceless.

* Your age. Some countries care.
* Your education background. Some countries require degrees. Others don't.
* Your *real* job skills. Be specific. IT skills could mean ""I have 8 years of experience building enterprise-scale OLAP systems with Oracle and .Net"". or ""I installed a sound card on my mom's PC"".
* Any language skills (including English, if it's not your native language)
* Any criminal convictions? (A throwaway account is OK :)
* Are you willing to consider alternative destinations?
* Temporary or permanent?

And last, but not least: **what is your nationality and where do you live**? I can't believe people keep forgetting to specify the latter, but they do.

I’m always reading fascinating discussions on Reddit and other sites about what it’s like to live in different countries and cities around the world, but I’ve found that the same sorts of questions appear time and time again and the best answers end up scattered across different threads and websites.

I decided to build istorical.com to try to foster a community where you can find out everything you’d ever want to know about what it’s like to live in Barcelona, Tokyo, New York City, or wherever else you dream of. You can view and discuss videos, and read and post answers to questions about what the local people are like, the cost of living, things to do there, local culture, nightlife, healthcare, unsafe areas, social rules, and much more.

As of today, istorical.com is a collection of 196 countries, 2,540 cities, 154 videos, and more than 95,000 questions begging to be answered. I’m building this alone, and it’s been extremely rewarding and educational, but also incredibly challenging for me to get even friends and acquaintances to post on the site. If you answered even a few questions about what life is like in your city or country, or a city or country you’ve traveled to or lived in, I would be incredibly grateful.

And of course, I’d also love to hear about any feedback or bugs you encounter, as well as features you would prioritize improving or creating next.

Thanks for reading, and maybe even for answering a question or two on istorical!

EDIT: [Forgot the link!](http://www.istorical.com)

SECOND EDIT: Woo-hoo! Didn't get downvoted to oblivion!

New questions: 
What would it take for you to answer five questions about your city or the country you live in? Does it just seem too empty right now to be worth posting in?

And would you be annoyed if you were private messaged out of nowhere and asked if I could quote one of your comments from elsewhere on Reddit and post it as a new quotation-answer on istorical.com? With attribution and thanks to your reddit username and a link back to the comment on Reddit or your Reddit profile? The quote would be displayed right alongside the rest of the answers to a question but with huge quotation marks around it and the credit to you for writing the original comment or whatever.

LAST EDIT:

So much great feedback! Bugs to be fixed, ideas I hadn't considered, and good ideas about marketing! And lots of good answers posted by Redditors from all over the world today. The reaction has definitely shocked me. To any Europeans just waking up, you guys seem to absolutely be the ones I need to court for answers!

I've been following this subreddit for quite a while, and I finally want to share what I experienced while living abroad in different contexts, countries and times of my life. I will talk about my experiences, pros and cons, and advice for people who want to experience living in a foreign country.

---**Experiences**---

I'm an Italian in his mid-20s, currently living in a big italian city. I've been abroad three times, and they've all been very different experiences:

1) **High School Exchange Student**. I was 17 at the time, and I moved in the countryside of Washington state (USA) to attend one year of high school. When I got there I was barely able to speak any english. This experience has been the most powerful, because of the age, the duration and how immersive it has been. At the time, facebook and skype weren't popular, so I had minimal contacts with the people back at home. Most of the english I know today comes from that experience.

2) **Erasmus Programme**. In my early 20s, it is a scholarship-based programme offered by the European Union to students in order to study abroad. I spent a semester in Spain, in Andalucia. All in all a great experience because of how beatiful the place was, and because of the awesome international environment created by this programme. I had friends and roommates from all over the world, and I'm still in contact with lots of them. I also had incredible vacations around the world, hosted by these friends. I didn't know any Spanish at all, but for an Italian, it's sort of cheating...

3) **Visiting Scholar for Thesis work**. All italian degrees require a thesis work, and I wanted to use this occasion to go abroad again. Through my professors, I was able to contact a professor in Ohio State University, and I asked him if I could do my thesis work over there. He said yes and invited me over for a semester with a J-1 VISA. I didn't have to pay tuition and I also got a scholarship, which helped quite a bit. In general, I always had rent/tuition covered when I studied abroad.

---**Considerations about living abroad**---

I will list some positive and negative aspects about spending some time abroad. Those are purely subjective, but they might be useful to anybody who is considering moving to another country.

**PROS**

- **Open-mindedness**: Staying abroad forces you to be in contact with people with very different backgrounds and outlook on what they expect from life. This kind of interaction had a huge impact on me, as I included all those diverse views into my own way of seeing things. The result is that I became very flexible in accepting and understading people's choices. If before I imagined life more like a straight line, with certain steps that seemed expected, almost dogmatic, now I see a world a possibilities.

- **The possibility to reinvent yourself**: Have you ever thought how you would be if you were born in a different family, country and context? What if you could start all over and fix certain bad habits that you can't get away from in your everyday life? Moving abroad is such a drastic change that it really feels like starting again. I feel like I created a better self abroad compared to the one in my own country. Sometimes the root of our problems and dissatisfaction can be found in the way we did set up our everyday routine and, even if we recognize where the issue is, the power of the habit is so strong that it's actually very very hard to change things. Moving abroad can disrupt this routine, let you start all over again and, at least in my experience, set up a happier lifestyle. The bad part? Usually those bad habits waited for me back in my own country...

- **A world of friends**: Making strong frienships with people from all over the world is actually an awesome part of living abroad. I was able to visit so many countries because of friends hosting me, which makes traveling 200% more interesting. Not only it becomes very cheap to travel, but it also mean that you will have a friend as soon as you get there to welcome you, usually willing to show you how things truly are out of the touristic side of a certain place. Living in Italy also gives me the occasion to give back, which is also very cool.

**CONS**

- **You will always be a foreigner**: Wrap your mind around it, if you grew up in a certain country, you'll always be a foreigner if you move somewhere else. I've met many Italians who lived abroad for like 30 years, and they still act as italian as they never left the country. This fact is not necessarily negative, as long as you face it and accept it. The country where you grew up defines your cultural background so heavily that there is not really a way around it, it will always be ""your country"", in the same way as you will always have a mother tongue.

- **Language barrier**: this one is pretty obvious, but I had to say it. It doesn't matter if you studied the language of the country you want to move in, for a long time you'll still be left out of what's really going on in conversations between locals. It takes a lot of effort to catch the humor, the jokes, the fluency to really be active in conversations. This can be frustrating, and it is also the reason why you'll be attracted more by the expats and international community, where not only you can have normal conversations, but they will also understand better your experience and connect with you much quicker. 

- **Romantic relationships**: The fact that I moved abroad so much is not the only reason, but certainly is a strong element that caused me to not really have a long term relationship until now. The constant mindset ""oh well, I'll be leaving soon anyway, not really worth it to focus so much on this relationship"" really impacted my ability to create a meaningful relationship. I've actually become a little cold on this side, because of a couple of very hard experiences in the past that made me reluctant now to throw myself into a relationship with difficult future prospects. The fact that you'll be attracted more to people with international backgrounds doesn't help, since you double the chances that one of you will leave at a certain point.

---**Advice for people that want to live abroad**---

- Don't underestimate the problems connected with obtaining a VISA for the country you want to move in. I pretty much gave up with moving to the US for now, as I really don't want to deal with the hardship of the immigration process at the moment.

- There is no perfect country, but there are countries that suits you more than others. For example, I don't feel that the Italian culture fits me well, and I feel much closer to the US lifestyle, although I don't think the US is ""better"" than Italy.

- Visit the country for a few months before you move there for good. Expectations can be very different from reality.

- Don't expect things to go well the first weeks/months you move abroad. Life will most likely be much harder and frustrating than the place you came from. Don't worry, it will get better quickly.

- When abroad, talk to whoever you get the chance to. You need to get out of your comfort zone as much as you can, or it will take forever to make friends (although, as usual, it's also a matter of luck to be in the right place at the right time).

- Research in advance every kind of information you possibily can about the new place. Even looking how the real estate/renting system work in a certain city or country can save you a lot of frustration (I experieced first hand that renting a room in Andalucia and in a US college compus is not exactly the same thing....)

- Don't go live abroad to escape or if you are depressed. You will most likely bring your problems with you.

---------

Now that I graduated, I plan on keep travelling and live in other countries. Luckily companies seem to love my CV full of international experiences, togheter with a M.Sc.. I graduated a month ago and I already have a few interviews lined up for jobs in Germany/France. Wish me good luck :)


Well, this is it, I hope this wall of text was useful to somebody. If you have questions, don't be afraid to ask!

**TLDR;** Go abroad, worth it.

At Agrista, we are looking for both experienced software developers and talented developers with less experience. We are also hiring network administrators. 

###Agrista
We are a small company, but growing fast. Our team comes from all over the world: China, Romania, South Africa, United States, and Germany. In the office we work in English. 

We work hard, but we also have a good time. A hot lunch is cooked by a volunteer member of the team every day, we unwind after a long day with a foosball match, and our office is located in a quiet and idyllic section of Munich in an old farmhouse converted into office space.

###Munich
Munich is a lovely city, great for cycling (being relatively flat), and it has a good public transportation network. It is easy to live here without a car. In the city, you have the fantastic English Garden for outdoor recreation. If you are into skiing or hiking, there are mountains less than an hour away, and many hiking and biking trails are even closer. There are several lakes easily reachable with the suburban train lines. There is a large and active expat community, so it is easy to meet people based on your interests and make new friends. 
###Language
Having recently moved to Munich myself from the US, I can tell you that it is possible to get by here without knowing German. English is very widely spoken. That said, if you want to learn German, there are lots of schools in Munich, and we hold an informal weekly German lesson in the office as well.

###Jobs
As I mentioned we are looking for:

* Junior developers
* Senior developers
* Network administrators

We work with a number of platforms and technology stacks. We aren't looking for people who know a specific language or framework, because we believe talented developers who know the fundamentals of computer science will fit in and learn our platform quickly.

###Perks/Benefits
Some of the perks/benefits we offer are free lunch, 25 vacation days per year in addition to sick time, and there is a spare private room at the office where one person can stay on a short term basis while he or she looks for a place to live, depending on availability. As a worker in Germany, you will automatically be part of the health insurance, unemployment, and pension systems.

###How to apply
If you want more information or have any questions, feel free to PM me. If you are interested in applying for a position, link your CV or resume in a PM to me, or contact me and I will provide you with my email address.",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,1370560485.0,,,True,t3_1fsjda,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1fsjda/want_out_have_it_skills_work_for_an_awesome/,

Yes, i know, i have to suck it up and do stuff that i don't like. Well, everytime i do something i don't like, i lose the will to do it, it takes me a long time and i do a half assed job.

I always wanted to be a conceptual designer for video games. Character concepts, monsters and such i really love that and i like to think im good at it. I always wanted to work for Valve, but i wouldn't be suprised if that dream didn't come true.

What i want to know is, is the US still a good option for a country to move to? I've had several people who moved from my country telling me it's great over there (i guess when compared to the shithole of my country) but at the same time reddit blasts in my face how shitty the US is, and Americans want to move out of the US, prefferably to Canada.

So tell, me is it good or not? It will probably be better for me, since at least in the US i can eat like a normal human being.

Help will be appreciated :)

For those new to /r/IWantOut, I wrote the [How to Ask for Help](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/qb8jc/how_to_ask_for_help_in_riwantout/) and [Overseas Exile](http://www.overseas-exile.com) links in the sidebar. I post here relatively frequently and have helped several people move abroad. I've been successful enough at it that my wife and I (both serial expats) have started a company whose goal, amongst other things, is to help people move abroad. Part of that is international IT recruitment. The founder of this subreddit, /u/ohstrangeone, has given me permission to post *relevant* job postings here.

Our company specializes in helping companies willing to sponsor work permits (or the local equivalent).

**The Jobs**

Our latest client is a company in Hanover, Germany, who is hiring for four different positions.

* Front-end developer: you're an expert with HTML/CSS/Javascript (jQuery). You're good at design and it's a bonus if you're comfortable with Photoshop, GIMP, or other related tools. You also understand the important of user interface design. It's a strong plus if you know Perl or are willing to learn. You'll primarily focus on the back-end, but if you can sometimes hack on the back-end code, that's a bonus!

* DevOps. Yes, we know the term is often poorly defined, but as DevOps, not only will you be responsible for keeping their systems up and running, you’ll also have the ability to shape the operations management product all your colleagues are using. You will be there working with the dev team to help them build the right ops management system. One of your first tasks will likely be to help the team build a robust continuous deployment system with easy deployment/roll back capabilities.

* Two strong Perl devs. You'll be familiar with testing, ""modern Perl"", and refactoring. You should function well in a team environment and be able to mentor other developers. You'll get the best equipment and rather than open plan, developers get to work in offices with only two or three other devs.

**Why work in Hanover?**

* Lots of asparagus!
* 500k people
* University city, cosmopolitan
* Capital of Lower Saxony 
* Largest computer fair in the World (CeBIT) 
* Greenest city in Germany (forest, lake, parks, rivers) 
* Perfect for bikes, perfect public transportation 
* Low rents (much lower than Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Köln/Düsseldorf)
* Low cost of living 
* Centrally located train station, 15 minutes walk from the office 
* Airport 30 min from the office (by public transport) 
* 1.5 hours train to Hamburg, 1.7 hours to Berlin

**The Company**

They're located in Hanover, Germany. They're stable, profitable and they've been around for over a decade. Hanover is a beautiful, bike-friendly, mid-sized town in the north of Germany. The cost of living is low and the quality of life is high. It's a green-friendly town and hosts one of the largest Oktoberfests in the world.

Oh yeah, you also get thirty days vacation :)

And yes, we're still hiring. Don't think of this an an ""old"" post :)

***Update 2***: I am, as you might imagine, swamped with private messages from people. Please bear with me. I also have a job to do, a wife to keep happy and a baby to feed :) If you don't hear back from me in a couple of days, ping me again.

**Update**: To clear up a misconception some people have had in private messages to me: I am not a headhunter. I'm one of their back end developers and the company is happy with me trying to recruit people.

**Note**: Though I'm a long-term Redditor, I realized that this might be perceived as spam, so I took the trouble of first getting the approval of [ohstrangeone](http://www.reddit.com/user/ohstrangeone/), the /r/IWantOut/ moderator.

Background: many of you already know me through my [Overseas Exile blog](http://overseas-exile.blogspot.com/), particularly since I'm mentioned in the [/r/IWantOut FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/gy8yn/stuff_for_the_faq_help_me_build_our_faq/). I'm an American living in Amsterdam, previously having lived for years in the UK, the US (duh) and Japan. If you're reading this subreddit, there's a very good chance that you'd like to figure out how to move to another country. Here's how: my employer, [booking.com](http://www.booking.com/), is willing to *pay you* to move to Amsterdam. 

Take a look at [our job openings](https://booking-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.welcome&amp;category_id=2726&amp;company_id=1006&amp;version=1&amp;startflag=1&amp;parent=IT%20&amp;levelid1=2726) (new openings appear constantly). We're hiring plenty of Perl, Android and iPhone devs, DBAs, network admins, system admins, front-end developers and so on. I'd tell you what a great company it is to work for (and it's true), but you've heard it all before and why would you believe me?

Besides, **we pay you to move to frickin' Europe!** If the idea of sitting on the side of [a beautiful Amsterdam canal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canals_of_Amsterdam), enjoying a Grolsch and eating *bitterballen*, surrounded by people from all over the world sounds appealing, a great place to work is just an added bonus.

As for Amsterdam: I've travelled extensively over Europe and I think it's one of the most accessible European cities for Americans as English is spoken almost universally. The city is very beautiful, has around a million inhabitants (depending on how you count them) and is about 700-800 years old (again, depending on how you count). We have more canals than Venice and a rather unique architectural style. In my opinion, walking down the [Prinsengracht at sunset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/onefiftyeight/3968105514/) is one of the loveliest walks in the world.

We're happy to hire rock star IT people, but we know that most developers are not rock stars. That's OK. We just want good, solid people who don't drool too much. If you think you might be a fit, you can drop me a line here and I can send your resume for you and let our HR know directly (disclaimer: if you get hired, I get €1,000 for that). If you dont feel comfortable with that, you can [apply directly for the job openings](https://booking-openhire.silkroad.com/epostings/index.cfm?fuseaction=app.welcome&amp;category_id=2726&amp;company_id=1006&amp;version=1&amp;startflag=1&amp;parent=IT%20&amp;levelid1=2726).

The hiring process is simple: if we think you're a fit, we try to schedule a phone interview. If that goes well, we will probably fly you to Amsterdam and put you up in a hotel for a face-to-face interview. If you like us and we like you, we will pay your relocation costs to Amsterdam, including putting you up in a short-stay apartment for your first month while you figure out where in the city you'd like to live.

Oh, and you also get five weeks *paid* holiday (this is normal in Europe). Hop on a train and spend a weekend in Paris. Take a 25 minute flight to London. Take a two-week road trip through Eastern Europe knowing that when you get back, you still have three weeks of vacation left.

If you have any questions about Amsterdam, Europe or the job, let me know and I'll try to answer them.

I have to say this is really jumping the gun. 

The question before that should be, what decent paying jobs can you get back home? If you can't answer this first question, then you won't get any typical work visa, period. 

Subsequently, if you are not likely to qualify for any skilled jobs (as determined by the host country, but the list for these is usually very similar among countries), then your best chance is to go to a country that has a working *holiday* visa arrangement with your country, where you can work odd/part-time jobs for 1-2 years. This visa is probably the best option for a lot of people here who just want to get out, but for some reason is commonly down voted. And of course, a very common way young people get out is to TEFL (teaching English) in various countries that are desperately in need of native English speakers, usually in East and South-East Asia.

You can't expect to start a career in a foreign country with nothing unique to offer. You'll have to already be somewhat established before other countries will welcome you, as ironic as it is.

I mean, do you people really think that another country, especially a developed one, is going to roll out the red carpet for you just because you happen to speak English and want to go there?  Fuck no.  

Your first step should be learning a valuable skill.  Engineering is good.  IT is good.  SOMETHING useful.  Just being American is not useful.  People seem genuinely surprised that simply being from the ""greatest country on earth"" somehow entitles them to live and work anywhere they want.  I see this way too much. 

Also, be prepared for huge fees to be involved in the process.  Seriously, what did you expect?  I mean, to go to the U.S. legally, someone will end up paying $5,000-$10,000 in fees, why would you be shocked that other countries would expect the same?  

Are you really serious about moving to a certain country but you have no marketable skills?  Then grow up and consider marrying in.  This may require you to do difficult things like developing basic social skills and making commitments, but fucking seriously people...

I estimate my time to be worth about $25 an hour so if I am going to do say 24 hours of work beyond what I would would to donate (8 hours preparing, 16 hours at the sale itself) and get $400 (which would surprise me frankly) then I would be looking at a net loss of $200 plus a giant headache because that is what yard sales always are.

I'm happy to edit this post as time goes on - comment any feedback!

**IS CANADA A BAD PLACE TO LIVE?**  
Last time, we started with the benefits of life in Canada, and glossed over the negatives. So this time, I thought it might be helpful to start with some negatives. This was hard to write (because I'm a patriotic Canadian and couldn't think of much), so Canada-h8rs, please chime in. For the most part, Canada is:

* Colder than you may be used to. Do *not* underestimate how frustrating this can be. Many immigrants really struggle with this. Not only is it unpleasant, it's a nuisance. In winter, we wake up 30-60 minutes early each morning to shovel our driveway (which can be hard, back-breaking work), and remove the ice and snow encrusted on our entire car. We may have to do the same upon leaving work. You are legally required to keep your sidewalk clear of snow and ice (for safety), which many mean shovelling daily. Public transport and roads are all much slower in winter. We have less sun in winter - it may be dark at 4:30 or 5pm depending on where you are. If you're from Iceland, this is no big deal, but if you're from Costa Rica, you may not enjoy this. 

* Kind of like a more boring, less famous USA. Try naming 10 famous things in America. Now try naming 10 in Canada. Sure, we have cool stuff here too, and I would always choose Canada over the USA, but it's never going to have the same glamour as moving to the USA. 

* Not free of bad people. It's a terrible tendency of this subreddit, and Reddit overall, to glamourize certain countries, Scandinavian countries and Canada especially. In my experience, Canadians are some of the nicest people on earth, but we DO have crime, we have corruption, we have rude people, we have racists, we have homophobes, we have sexists, and if you stay here long enough, you'll see all of them. Just like any other country.

* More expensive, compared to the US and most non-European countries. This is very hard to quantify. Dollar-by-dollar, most things are cheaper in America. But our minimum wage is substantially higher, and people tend to get paid more for whatever in Canada than in the US (except in some fields, like medicine or law). But our taxes can be higher. But you don't have to worry about medical insurance, and our universities are cheaper. Our rent is hard to compare nation-to-nation. So it's all a bit complicated. But a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, a MacBook, your cell phone bill? All of these will cost more in Canada than in the US. (It's because distribution is expensive - Canada has EXTREMELY low population density. Small market spread over huge area.)

**COST OF LIVING**  
Actually, [this site](http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=Canada&amp;city=Toronto) does it better than I can. That link's for Toronto but they have other cities too. Cheaper than most of Europe, more expensive than Latin America or most of Asia. 

**DAY-TO-DAY LIFE**  
A few people asked about what life is like day-to-day. This seems like a really boring section to me, being that it's my life, but who knows, maybe this will be different from what you're used to? If you're American, this'll be dull! I'll talk about a typical work day for me when I used to work in a shop in Toronto. 

**7:30am** Wake up. I live in a quiet, residential neighbourhood with tall trees lining the streets. Head downstairs and have some Cheerios and milk for breakfast, and maybe an orange. If I get up earlier, I have time to fry up an egg with toast, but normally I don't. Have a shower, shave, brush my teeth, get dressed, grab my bag. 

**8am** Leave the house. It's January so it's somewhere between 5C and, like, -12C, so a coat and waterproof boots are important, or else feet get wet from the snow. I walk three blocks to the bus stop, take the bus to the subway station (10m ride), and then take the subway four stops (8 minutes). Get off and wait 10 minutes for the second bus for about a 15 minute ride which stops outside where I work. This whole thing costs $3, or a monthly pass is about $125.

**8:50am** Head into my local coffee shop, across the street from my job. The barista knows me because I come in most mornings, and greets me by name. We chat while she makes my drink ($3.50). I cross the street to show up for work.

**9am** Work starts! I work in a store with mostly people my own age (18-25) and the managers are really great people, so this goes by pretty fast. I make minimum wage, which is $10.25/hr and lunch is unpaid, so that works out to around $90/day before tax. But I can also make commissions, so a good day might be $120. I work 9-6 with 30m for lunch and a 15m coffee break. I should bring my lunch with me but I'm lazy and normally go buy a crepe across the street for $7-8. Oops. The guy who owns the place is Swiss and also knows me by name.

**6pm** I head home, same as above but in reverse, another $3. I cook dinner when I get home.

**9pm** I might text friends to see if they want to meet up downtown and maybe go see a movie or hang out at a bar, or I might stay home and watch TV/go on Reddit if I'm lazy. Our drinking age is 18 or 19 depending on where you are. A normal, decent bar charges about $6 for a pint glass of beer, or $4-5 for a bottle. A rum and coke is normally $4-6. Movies are $8-15 depending on the cinema and if it's 3D. We have a lot of live music in Toronto, so sometimes I'll check event listings and see what's going on that night. I'll try to go home before 1:30am when public transit shuts down, because a cab home from downtown will be $15-20. Some nights, I bartend, which is a great job if you can get it. It's hard work from 8 or 9pm until 2am or 3am, but I can pull in $200-300+ with tips. 

**FUN IN CANADA**  
[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cotGh4Lu29M) is actually a good place to start, showing Canadians having fun. These are Canadians, not tourists, in the video, but note that it's biased towards outdoorsy stuff (as opposed to cultural stuff), and that it shows ALL OF CANADA…so not all activities shown are possibly in all parts of Canada, obviously. 

In Toronto, we have many Broadway plays come direct from NYC. We have incredible live music across Canada, especially in the East, among our small island provinces. Montréal and Québec City are like a small part of idyllic France in Canada, with cobblestone streets, outdoor cafés, public gardens, and a tremendously active arts scene. In the West, we have the huge city of Vancouver surrounded by mountains - perfect for an urban nature-lover. Canadians are proud of and love their outdoors in all seasons. Most born-in-Canada Canadians I know can do at least two of skating, skiing and snowboarding. (And we'd be happy to teach you, too! I've taught at least three immigrant friends to skate.) 

Many middle-class and upper-class families own cottages, which are like small second homes in very rural areas, often ""closed"" in winter, that families drive to visit on weekends or during summer vacation. They tend to be on lakes, and many cottage owners use their cottage as a base to swim, canoe, sail, skidoo, seadoo, jetski, tube, fish, wakeboard, surf, trampoline, hike, hunt, etc. etc. Canadians will often invite friends to their family cottage. Many Canadians travel in winter to ski resorts on mountains for a few days of skiing/snowboarding and, for younger Canadians, partying. Canada is huge enough that whether you love museums and theatre, or surfing and hang-gliding, there's a part of Canada where you'll be happy. 

**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WATCHING**  
[This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrA4V6YF6SA) is an American news anchor, Tom Brokaw, explaining Canada for 6 minutes. It was recorded for the 2010 Winter Olympics, which were in Vancouver, Canada. It's an incredibly good explanation, makes me all tingly as a Canadian, and has a lot of great video of Canada. I cannot recommend this enough. 

**UNIVERSITIES IN CANADA**  
[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14f1j1/the_friendly_canucks_big_guide_to_how_to_get_in/) talks about how to study in Canada, but doesn't talk about universities. To summarize: about $9000-20,000 in tuition per year for int'l students, but you'll probably be able to permanently live and work in Canada after. 

Where should you study? That's a hard question even for Canadian students. Universities commonly included on Canadian students' ""top picks"" include University of Toronto, McMaster University, Queen's University, Dalhousie University, McGill University, University of British Columbia, and University of Waterloo. (McMaster, Waterloo, Toronto, Queen's and McGill are particularly notable for sciences. Toronto, McGill, Dalhousie and UBC are particularly notable for arts. Yes, Toronto and McGill are notable for both.) Those are all large universities of at least 20,000. 

I attended a small university and much preferred it - more personal attention, friendlier environment. Small schools worth considering are Emily Carr (for visual art/design), Mt. Allison, Memorial University (least expensive in Canada), Acadia University (especially for biology, kinesiology, business, music, music therapy, recreation management, pre-med), St. Francis Xavier, and St. Mary's. If you want a relatively large city and a small university, look at Memorial and St. Mary's.

I have nowhere else to turn. ",anharmonica,78,15,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/ns1w9/my_life_has_hit_a_complete_dead_end_i_live_in_the/,"Okay reddit. Here's the basic story:

My life has been shit I've been trying to put back together for over seven years. My shit started when living at home, though I escaped that (or I thought). 

I moved out on my own and sought what jobs I could (living in a fucking coal camp doesn't give many options when you're not big for the coal industry). 

Since then I've tried and tried to survive here and there. 

My brother killed himself last year. My crackhead father tried to kill himself this year and I had to miss work and go in debt to ""save him"" though I didn't want to be in that position. 

At this point, the love of my life decided she was destined for a completely different life of something I could never provide. Out of the blue, I was told to ""get lost"". Nothing negative was ever said for three years with this. 

I never even saw it coming. 

Said person is now happily married and has a child on the way which I had no clue about as there was no communication for the last four months. 

My job sucks, though I do have several skills. 

I have just enough money in my 401k and am young enough to cash it out and live off of it for a few weeks/month or two. 

I really, REALLY need to head west. Somewhere west of the Mississippi and secluded (as in, desert or wilderness BFE west). 

The catch is, I'm really lost. I have no clue where to go. 

I've thought about just driving and looking for a beautiful place that I'm at peace with and try to find a job there. 

That's reckless given my current situation financially (I have a car, really my only financial issue). So I can't go without work forever. I would also need a place to start over and live anew with whatever few things I can pack in my jeep. 

My skills are as follows:
-6 years of call center experience with supervisor duty
-2 years of drafting and design at a local tech school and about a year of surveying experience in the field. 

I'm really an outdoors person and would love to be in that type of field. 

I'm ready to start talking to people and making plans, but the only thing holding me back is where I'm actually going to go and not having some chance at a job somewhere to pay my bills. 

Additionally, I'd like to mail my roomie each months rent until he finds a replacement. I don't want to leave him hanging. 



I'd be more than willing to work on something small to start out. So long as I had cheap room/board and a job, I could always move up. 

I just NEED to start over. 


I'm lost in the world, Reddit. My heart pounds with every second I'm still here. 

Help... Please.

Edit: wow, Reddit. This was amazing support. More than I had anticipated. I went to bed last night but awoke to these inspiring posts. I thank you all and will take all of this advice collectively to move forward with a plan. Thank you again.

***New edit: Thanks again guys, I'm trying to respond when I can here at work. Maybe more when I get home, we're kind of busy tonight. You're all inspirational and your words have been taken to heart for this future change.

I tried this post in AskReddit a few weeks back and I got downvoted to hell and back. I heard that you guys, including the expats among you, might be able to give my wife and I some good advice and thoughts. So here it goes:

For many reasons, the country of my birth is disappointing me. The outlook of the US economy, our crumbling public education system, spiraling healthcare, paralyzed political system, unemployment, ballooning debt, general anti-science rhetoric, etc make me think that this country might not be the best place for the future of my family. I know that the long-term severity of many of these problems might be arguable, and a more passionate person might fight to change the system instead of (cowardly?) fleeing it, but moving really seem like the option my wife and I might take. We excited at this as a chance to broaden our horizons and start ""fresh"" in a new home.

Foreigners, ex-pats, and even fellow countrymen, what other countries offer the best opportunities for a born-and-raised American? If it adds specifics to the discussion, I am finishing my MD and my wife is a RN (both with significant student loans, which we are planning on paying off regardless of our moving decision), and we are very 'liberal' in our political views (although I still welcome any perspectives from our conservative colleagues!). We have minimal fluency in Spanish and French. We don't have any family outside the US.

Our timeline for making a decision is about 5-10 years, until the time we are financially stable and can make the final decision to jump. The big ones we are considering are the UK, Canada, and Australia. I wish there were more options but as a future medical professional (and with all of the vocabulary and verbal interactions that it entails), I feel confined to pick a country with English as the primary language. We hope to be able to visit these countries before making any big decisions.

Any thoughts on these three countries? They all seem ""better"" than the US by many social and economic measures, but there are other factors we are considering like location (ie near US vs near Europe vs near Asia), geography, climate (we are spoiled by four seasons here), culture, attitudes towards immigrants, etc!

Thanks for the advice and help. This would be a huge, life-changing decision, but our discussions concerning moving are becoming more and more serious!",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,False,,,True,t3_mtfmv,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/mtfmv/my_wife_and_i_are_unhappy_with_the_way_the_us_is/,

The thing is; life isn't quite awesome for mid-low class... I feel my country hasn't given me anything. It is taking everything I work for instead, one thing at the time.

Yes, we have public health care (which sucks), and yes, we have a public university (which you can't attend to if you have a job), and yes, we have rather good beaches (in snobby places). But that's far from being everything a person needs to live comfortably.

I've put together a list of reasons of why I hate my country, and the reasons I have to leave:

* Taxes are high as fuck!  
Uruguay is the country with the most expensive cars in the world (and we are not talking about freaking Lamborghinis here), they have ridiculously high taxes and lack ABS, air bags or approved seat belts. You can see a car's price skyrocket to above twice the manufacturer's price. [Here is a graphic explanation of this (Spanish, but you can just look at the picture)](http://www.elobservador.com.uy/noticia/204609/el-auto-es-mas-caro-en-uruguay/).
We have one of the the highest basic VAT in the world (22%).

* Groceries and everyday stuff are expensive.  
Above bullet's consequence.

* Public transportation is slow and inefficient.  
I obviously don't have a car, so I have to take the bus everywhere I go. These buses aren't frequent, and take around 3 or 4 times longer to arrive to a given destination than it would take with a car. Shit, sometimes I walk and arrive faster than on a bus.  
You would think ""just use a bicycle"". [No way, Jose](http://www.hark.com/clips/twhckndgph-story-of-the-hippo), people can't drive properly and it's not safe to do it.

* You can't live with just one job.  
My mother is 50 years old and has 2, totaling 15 hours of work on weekdays, and 4 hours on Saturdays. All the money she makes becomes bills, paying for the loan she asked for to buy the house, and food. She should be enjoying herself at her age, but she's working like never before instead. This hurts me a lot. She didn't want me to work until I was of legal age, luckily I was able to get a job by that time.

* We work our asses off for pennies, and feed scum.  
The government takes a percentage of our hard-earned wage and gives it to slackers and thieves who don't work, they are the people who rob our stores and steal us in the street, threatening us with a gun, a knife or a gang of thugs down the corner. That's called ""equity plan"" and it's supposed to help balance wealth.

* People are depressed, in general.  
No wonder why they are...  
70% of Uruguay's population has at least mild depression, and we have the highest suicide rate in Latin America.  
I've witnessed 2 suicides while sitting in my chair at work (jumped out the window) and 1 while walking down the street (same).

I want to leave this place and start over in a country who gives opportunities to the working class... but I have no idea where to start from...  
I am just a 22 year old computer programmer and student looking for a change in his life, and Uruguay won't give that to me.",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,False,,,True,t3_13xx1j,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/13xx1j/iwantout_uruguay/,

You become less of you because you now have to process a lot more information about the environment or about new social norms, etc. Where you used to make jokes about certain subjects or in certain ways back home, you now stay a bit quieter because your brain is 2 seconds slower and/or your humor doesn't translate well yet.

Even if it's ""just"" to Canada (from the USA).

Cost, civil, legal issues aside...

I know many of you want to leave due to social reasons such as the rampant ignorance from religious-conservatism. Maybe you're gay, an atheist, etc and you live in a red state... there's blue states, you know. If you don't live in the Northeast or West Coast, you should try it. New York and California are not Texas or North Carolina when it comes to gay rights, women's issues, etc. Portland Oregon... that's all I have to say.

Or, maybe you want to move for tax/cost reasons? Good luck finding a western civ nation with lower taxes (and cheaper cost of living) than the US. Maybe you live in NY or CA, where taxes are too astronomical for you... you could always move to Texas or New Hampshire, you know. (There's even a liberal sect of Texas, it's called Austin, and it's awesome.)

I know it's painful to live where you're probably ""stuck"" but please, give another state a try first. It's easier to ""undo"" any damage from moving, and just plain easier to do. For example, it's much easier to have a job lined up in another state, than trying to find a job as an immigrant in another country, then trying to also get work visa AND sponsorship, etc.

Plus, you can have a *real* job; there's only so many ""teaching English"" jobs to go around (and frankly, not everyone is qualified to do it).

So I didn't loose any money nor did I send them any sensitive documents. 

I'm gonna leave this post up, because it might make others more aware. This was a particular well planned scam. My colleagues and I were both fooled. 



I'm overjoyed at this moment, and still cannot quite grasp the reality. I might even still believe that this is a scam/ joke. For the last ten years I've been wanting to live South East Asia. After college, and finding myself in the construction industry to pay off student loans in Texas, I scored a job in Shanghai, China. The project here is ending in a few weeks, and I figured I'd just head to Thailand and teach English until something else pops up. Today I singed an employment contract with Exxon, working in Malaysia. I will be handsomely payed, working half the hours I am working now (from 80 to 40) and finally can live the expat dream. I'm 33 fucking years old, have no expenses.  

Sorry, I'm not trying to brag or anything, but ever since stepping foot in Thailand ten years ago, that is all I've been working for, thinking about. 

And thanks to all the people on here who have made it and have given me hope and motivation with your posts and stories.

So I'm posting it again in hopes that I, and other knowledgable folks on this subreddit, can help some more people out.

First things first: I'm not an immigration professional, lawyer, or in other way formally qualified to answer your questions.

That said, I am in the process of immigrating to Quebec, and, in my seven years here, have helped many others through the process from immigrant to citizen. I've taken several people to permanent resident landings in Lacolle, helped dozens of people apply for work and study permits, done a permanent resident landing myself, and have lots of tips and tricks to get through it as painlessly as possible.

Feel free to ask about immigration in general, your case in particular, or any other bureaucracy affecting newcomers to Quebec: driver's licenses, taxes, social insurance, French language tests, et cetera. Also feel free to ask about any of the less official aspects of immigration to Quebec.

Let's start a conversation. Et, bien sûr, il va sans dire qu'on devrait pas hesitez à répondre en français.

I'm an American working in Canada on a temporary visa which I can extend indefinitely and turn into a permanent residence, barring any unforeseen circumstances. Cool stuff.

I used to live in Syria. I had a girlfriend there. I'm also a girl, so it was pretty under wraps. I left when Syrian-American diplomatic relations took a downturn and, well, I had to leave. Being American and her being Syrian, there wasn't really anything we could do about it anyway.

However, now I'm a temporary worker in Canada. Apparently, I can apply for an open work permit for a spouse - even a female one! - if I work at a certain skill level (which I do.) Also, shit has hit the fan in Syria and we both want her out of there.

So, any idea whether it would be feasible to marry her and get her over here? How hard is it for the spouses of temporary workers to get work visas? Also, could we get married in, say, the embassy of some country that allows same-sex marriage? Sorry if it's a stupid question, but considering that her passport is toilet paper and we're both women, actually finding a place to tie the knot seems to be a pretty difficult task.

Any ideas?

My girlfriend and I are Canadian Redditors living in a small city in B.C., close to the US border. We've talked it over, and decided that if anyone is interested in possibly moving to our great nation, we'd love to help out.  Obviously very few people are just going to pack up and leave the US, sight unseen, so we figure if anyone is interested in taking a mini vacation and seeing if Canada is right for them, then we'd love to open our doors. 

We don't really know what would all be involved, but I figured something like a little bit sight seeing, job searching, economics scouting (house, gas, food prices, etc.) and of course a hockey game or 2. 

We would probably ask for a little bit of money, just to cover gas and food prices, but not much. We're not trying to make a profit off this, just help some people out. 

As for us? We're 25 and 26, I work full time, my girlfriend works from home. We enjoy video games, board games, movies, hockey, and other stuff. I'm a car guy, and I fly in my spare time. She is in to baking, painting and books. Obviously we'd like to get to know you a bit better before anything happens. 

Anyway, it's just an idea we've been kicking around. Tell me what you guys think!




UPDATE: Thanks for all the kind words guys! I didn't expect such a positive reception! I've replied to a few PMs, and I hope to be able to work something out. There are a couple hang-ups right now. Namely that I'd need to take time off from work to be a gracious host, and I can't afford that right now. Also, with my girlfriend working from home, that complicates things a bit.

* We're all fluent in English (accent and all), my mother isn't completely fluent though, but she's ok, just her conversational English that isn't perfect.

Here's mine

Mine was more luck than anything. I got my first taste of Europe when my Mom decided to take me to Amsterdam for a 4 day weekend.  I experienced enormous culture shock the few days I was there and it was that amazing feeling that left an impression on me. Something about the historic architecture, the casual smell of weed smoke while walking down the street, and the highest concentration of gorgeous women I'd ever seen, made me realize that I would absolutely love to live in Europe. I remember specifically passing by a beautiful Dutch girl about my age, and she gave me a smile that made me melt inside.

That was when I was 17, I went back to Amsterdam the following year after I graduated high school with some friends, then went to London the following year after that. I had a deep desire to live in Europe at that point, but had no connections or opportunities that would get me there. 

I ended up joining the Air Force, jumping in pretty blindly just to get out of my hometown. I went into an open job category where they could basically put me at any base, in any job relating to electronics. The day came where we found out our assignments, I pulled mine up on the computer and it said Ramstein AB, Germany. I was so damn excited that I hugged some random dude next to me.

I got to live there for two years, get paid enough money to go travel pretty frequently, and also had paid leave. While I was there I went to Amsterdam 4 more times, London again, Brussels, Berlin and Munich, Prague, Valencia, Barcelona, Interlaken, as well as a bunch of little towns throughout Germany. Had the time of my life and now I'm infected with the travel bug. I plan on living abroad again at some point, hopefully Australia this time.

Anyhow if I manage to save even one person or family from some life-altering trouble with the IRS, it'll be worth the negative karma.

Some background: The estimated number of Americans living abroad varies from 4 to 7 million, and in 2010 the IRS received fewer than 300,000 tax returns from them. So, if you're in that majority, this message is for you: **flying under the radar is going to be much, much harder starting in 2013**. This whole post is for you, too.

[There's this new law called FATCA](http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Specials/Rebuilding_the_financial_sector/Spotlight_on_banking_secrecy/New_US_tax_law_could_have_disastrous_effects.html?cid=8520476) that's coming into force in 2013 that we should all be aware of. Google it. It's basically going to make hiding from the IRS nearly impossible. (When I say ""hiding"", I mean everyone who's abroad who isn't filing, whether they know they should be or not.) For those of us who are filing, the IRS has hired thousands of [new auditors](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE7A363X20111104?irpc=932) in their International Division, don't be surprised.

I work very closely with experts in US expat taxation, and I've been researching and dealing with the issues for six years now. I thought I'd offer some of my knowledge to any redditors out there who have questions or want to discuss. If I don't have immediate answers, I can get them quickly from people who are experts on the matter.

Here's some good reading material on the subject for all you expats out there:

* [American Citizens Abroad](http://www.aca.ch/joomla/index.php) is one of your best friends out here.
* [WATCH OUT](http://www.aca.ch/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=492&amp;Itemid=46) for the new FATCA filing requirements
* [Random blogger news](http://www.usexpatriate.blogspot.com/)
* If the subject *really* pisses you off, [go here](http://renunciationguide.com/), the information is all very accurate.
* A [small book](http://www.uscms.org/uscms_at_work/working_cern/taxes/ExPats%20Guide%20To%20Taxes%202009.pdf) that covers the details, but is becoming out-of-date.

Here are some things that are important to know if this information has taken you by surprise:

* There is a ""Foreign Earned Income Exclusion"" of around $91,000 that will make *most* people's tax liability zero *if you file*. If you haven't been filing, you can still benefit if you come clean and back-file all the years that haven't been done. **If the IRS catches up with you before you file, YOU LOSE THIS EXCLUSION**. The sooner the better.
* The new FATCA rules will very likely see your foreign checking accounts declared to the IRS. If you haven't been declaring, the IRS is going to suddenly know where you are. Additionally, don't think you will be protected by your host country's privacy laws: most US tax treaties seek two things: avoidance of double-taxation *for foreign nationals* and a guarantee of free exchange of information to assist in taxing Americans abroad.
* These laws are NOT just for the ""rich."" Everyone gets shafted more or less equally in the eyes of the IRS. Don't make the mistake of thinking none of this applies to you.
* These laws apply equally to green card holders who have left the US. It doesn't matter if you're not a citizen and don't live there anymore.
* If you are self-employed and you're not in a country with a [social security totalization agreement](http://www.ssa.gov/international/agreements_overview.html) with the US, my heart bleeds for you. Find a good tax lawyer.
* If you are abroad and you've been filing yourself or with the help of programs like TurboTax, beware the rabbit hole is veeeery deep. The rules and regs are complex enough that you are almost certainly NOT filing correctly. Those thousands of new IRS auditors I mentioned earlier are looking specifically at you.

Ok, wow, sorry for the wall of text. I'm always open for questions and will do my best to get a correct and expert answer for you. This stuff *really sucks* and we're all in the same boat...

EDIT: Typos and added some info.

EDIT: **Lots of folks are asking about TurboTax.** My experience with it is from six years ago, and I found it wasn't really sophisticated enough to take me much beyond filling out the extra forms (like the 2555) myself. It may have improved some since then, I don't know. [Read this](http://taxes.about.com/b/2006/02/02/software-for-expatriates-tax-question-of-the-day.htm). Considering the unknown complexities and pitfalls of expat tax filing, my honest suggestion would be to have a tax professional prepare your taxes the first year, and then you can use that as a model for following years to file on your own. My personal experience is that my first attempt at it was an utter failure, even with a dead-simple tax situation. The return that I prepared and the one my wife's accounting firm did *were nothing alike*. To this day I cannot fathom how they take two numbers from me (gross and net salary) and produce *65 pages* of tax return.",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,True,,,True,t3_n3r52,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/n3r52/friendly_psa_for_americans_already_living_abroad/,

The stereotypes range from the usual (obesity, fast food, ignorance of other countries, war mongering, slutty, etc.) to the ridiculous. And every time that I have to clarify to people that my culture cannot be summed up by what they've seen in Hollywood and/or the news, I become a bit more jingoistic (horrible exaggeration ). 


The statement that borderline upsets me is a comment on America's ignorance of the rest of the world. I think to be told that the place I've grown up is full of ignorant people, is in itself an ignorant statement made a lot by people who've never actually stepped foot in America. Also, whenever people tell me that, I try to ask them to name one state capital (considering my country is 3 times the size of this continent and good number of the states in America are bigger than some of these countries). Verrrry few people can name a state capital (most common answer - New York, NY --WRONG it's Albany--) a lot of people don't even realize that Washington DC is not in a state at all. 

Anyways, half-rant, half-question. I find myself slowly on the path to jingoism (exaggeration) thanks to the ignorance I face abroad.

Not to say I regret getting out, I just have never experienced so much stereotyping in my life!!! And to put that in perspective, I'm a black female. By comparison, America's never ever made me feel like I have to be defensive about something I couldn't help. But Europe sure has. 


Also, if one more European makes some smartass comment about Americans only eating fast food, pizza, and hamburgers, they will be eating my fist. 

Edit: I don't mean I'm becoming jingoistic literally I was just exaggerating (luckily) I was just in a frustrated mood while writing this. Don't worry I don't have it in me to hate others for not being born on a certain plot of soil :)

Edit 2: my mention of the states is not because I expect people should know them in actuality.

Before you say that I can earn good money in my current position by working with international employers, I should say people expect a lot of work and pay very little for people who work from a third world country, and frankly, freelance is getting very rough lately.
I have finished an university in economics, this year I took my diploma (license diploma), but I won't say I'm very good at it.
I intend to take a master degree in IT, so that I can be proud of what I'm doing and help myself in finding jobs.

Did you regret anything?",apiRequest,67,22,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1hhn44/if_you_you_or_someone_you_know_have_done_it/,"Hello guys,

Ever since I have stepped out of my parents house(and became independent), I have been aware of my mortality. I know, I wouldn't live forever and as such I don't want to waste my time and stay in just one place without even seeing the beauty beyond the wall. I don't want to stay in one place for a couple of days either, perhaps a couple of months will do. I just didn't want to be stuck and be like everyone else - find a job, get married, buy a house, have children, grow old and rot. It just sounds so daunting! I wanna live an adventure! I don't want to be confined in a dark room, browsing the internet, banging my head against a wall as I ponder what the solution is, all day long. 

:(

Somehow, the people I've talked to about my plans weren't very supportive. They always told me to just buy a house and settle down, because one day I'll be old. But.. but.. To me, that sounds like equivalent to dying. I have pondered so much about this. The money just kept on rolling, and I barely spend a dime of it because I didn't really know what kind of material possession I wanted to buy. I would like to travel though. I wanna go out and just live an adventure, be lost in a sea of strangers and meet people and party and do happy things that normal people do. *I don't really go out much at the moment, but I wanna change that, I wanna push myself to do something before it's too late.* 

Anyhow, sorry for the long wall of text. I'm really glad I let that out. It's kinda hard to make conversations when everyone is glued to their screens. I've been reading, doing some research left and right, but somehow, I wanna know, if you (you, or someone you know) have done it (traveled and worked and lived, hopping around different countries), where did you start? Where did you go? What challenges did you face? And how was it in general? Did you regret anything?

The company I work for offers relocation packages for US/Canadian citizens and will help you sort out visa, living arrangements, etc.

The position is for Tier 3 of information security incident response in a major multinational company. This is **not** a 24/7 kind of deal - we work 9-5 (or 10-6, or whatever floats your boat) in the GMT+1 and then we go home. You would report to me directly, so I can vouch for the following being accurate.

You would be:

* Responsible for handling critical information security incidents (leaks, attacks, etc.).
* On the team that tunes and configures our security monitoring equipment (SIEM, NIDS, homegrown tools, etc).
* Involved in InfoSec planning and R&amp;D.

We can offer:

* Relocation, as discussed.
* 5 weeks paid vacation.
* A solid training/certification program.
* Home office several days a week.
* Ability to influence a growing information security organization of a major international company.
* I can guarantee that the work isn’t boring - we have strong a R&amp;D function embedded in the team this position is open for, we do projects, and you will have a chance to dedicate a portion of your time to learning, side projects, research or pursuing ideas you had on your morning commute.

(Actual) qualifications:

* 1-2 years experience in an information/network security field.
* Experience with a SIEM product - ArcSight is preferred.
* Excellent written and oral communication skills.
* Good understanding of network architecture concepts.
* Very good understanding of information security, latest trends, best practices and concerns.

Note that qualifications/requirements are not set in stone, but if you don’t meet most of the above, you're going to have to be really strong at something else.

Nice to have, by no means required:

* ACSA, CISSP, GIAC, similar.
* BSc. or equivalent in computer science or security is a bonus.
* Programming/scripting skills.
* Understanding of data-mining techniques, cryptography, endpoint forensics, and related fields.

My father is on his last course of treatment he will receive for his pancreatic cancer. If the costly whipple procedure does not work, he will forego any further treatment. Upon his demise, I inherit a little under $400k of property from him. Combined with my $190k condo, figure 10-15% lost in fees / taxes, what have you... Ignoring my current income... I'll be looking at $500k spending money... and no realistic ties to this place. I anticipate dying at his age of the same thing, considering my mother died young of cancer, too...

...But I don't want to buy some island...

...I want to survive in solitary confinement on a tropical island.

I'm well aware of the dangers of piracy, native peoples, insects, diesease and governments finding an expat hiding on a protected island. I'm well aware of the psychological maladies I will incur... there's more to it but I may enslist having a few others join me later on since I realize I'm in a unique position to assist others.

I own a 45-55' trawler I call the downeaster Alexa. If written elsewhere on reddit and another site about being a liveaboard on it until my dad fell ill last year. I've since erased the details until I'm certain I've wrapped up all loose ends and even still, as much as I'd love to write about every little part of my adventure, I must leave some obvious vagaries, though nobody has reason to go looking for me.

**My Resume**

- 3-year Liveaboard on a former fishing trawler that I've converted myself.

- I've disassembled and reassembled every part of my boat including near every element of the engine.

- Spent 3 months in the Yukon in a wilderness survival school for backpacking and canoeing. 

- I've backpacked the entire Appalachian Trail twice (NoBo and SoBo)

- I'm an okay fisherman. Haven't had a ton of practice, but can certainly improve in this regard.

- Electrician, Mechanic, Carpenter, Survivalist, Hermit.

Before anybody brings into question the livability of the downeaster Alexa, I've been a liveaboard on it for 3 years and have traversed thousands of nautical-miles in it. With much more fuel aboard (I haven't exactly run the numbers but...) I believe it is capable of crossing the atlantic in 3-4 weeks, but that is not my intention. I would likely have it hauled to several hundred miles near where my final destination be. Since I am in the Homework Stage, I'm trying to figure my destination.

So my questions boil down to:

- Region

- Emergency Wuss-Out Exit Strategy

- Nutrition

**Region**

This is where IWantOut comes into play... I'm looking for tropical but I figure the Bahamas is off the table. I'm looking for uninhabited islands with very little chance of being contacted by other persons. So my best guess is the Pacific Archipelagos... Melanesia, Micronesia. Problem is, I'm not geographically savvy with this area and so this is one of my first steps towards making a move.

I don't intend on having all my supplies brought out there willy-nilly and hoping to rough it. I will be doing research on the region and hopefully find an island that meets my needs, but once finished I do intend on either ""beaching"" the downeaster Alexa maybe 30' in-land if humanly possible (Winch / Trailer) much less likely pulling it into some cove... or more likely disassembling it to make a new shelter. I'm figuring a one-way trip and will prepare for one, with exception to bringing some camera and bookwriting supplies should I decide to return to civilization to cash in on my experience.

I'll be making likely two trips to the region I intend to inhabit beforehand including ""my island."" I'll have satellite photography taken of the region and investigate possible historical ones to see erosion issues. 

**Emergency Wuss-Out Exit Strategy**

It doesn't appear that LiFePO4 batteries would remain usable for 25-30 years as a ""just in case"" to throw into a Shortwave Radio, so it looks as though I'll need to bring a separate generator (other than the Alexa, which is diesel and could lose it, it could gum up or the engine could eventually fail.) Since Propane is the next most common fuel that hosts a generator and doesn't have an expiration, I may be forced to keep a spare tank (how much do they leak over decades?) in a sealed container with the generator as a back-up kit.

I figure there stands the possibility that nobody may return my call or assist in bailing me out, but it's more of a sanity reason. I have an Ocean Kayak as well that can be used for fishing or leaving the island.

**Nutrition**

Maybe I should be in r/PostCollapse on here. I don't intend on bringing enough food for 25 years, for certain. I realize I will be relegated to fishing, crabbing and what have you... but for good measure I figure I should bring a 55-gal drum of rice and 55-gal drum of beans just in case, no? Condiments, Salt, Seasoning?

I'm capable of making water, the Alexa has a 300GPD water maker which can also be run on generator that can be used for obviously a limited time... I'm no stranger to making stills for desalination, or catching water in a basin.

I landed in Australia almost exactly 5 years ago.  It became my home.  I left in the US a mother I loved but had a very tempestuous relationship.  I never thought I was American, I always knew I was British. I liked America in a superficial way but knew I didn't want to stay and could never make it my home. I was too scared to go back to Britain, to tired to deal with the family stuff, living up to the memory of my recently deceased father. 

I landed in what I thought was going to be beautiful sunny Australia. Unfortunately I made the mistake of choosing to move to Tasmania in the middle of the southern Winter. I walked out of the Airport in Shorts and a Tshirt into one of the coldest days Tasmania had had in a few years.  It was a shock.  

I moved into University Accommodation and found myself in a niche of my own. All the other English speaking foreigners were on exchange.  I was the only International there for 3+ years. Except the numerous Chinese and Malaysian students.  I quickly got lucky.  After about the first semester people realised I didn't belong in the Exchange group that each semester was born anew and semi segregated itself nor in the almost entirely non or poor english speaking International Asians.  As a result I quickly fell in with a group of 6-8 hard drinking Aussie lads.  I, for all intents and purposes, became Australian in their eyes, one of my greatest accomplishments.  They are my best friends and I am lucky in that I am one of the few left in Australia, so as I prepare to leave I have numerous very good friends spread around the world.

WE quickly built up a horrible reputation for raising hell and getting hammered on a regular basis.  We went on insane Road Trips (Melbourne to Perth and back). I made friends that I would do anything for.  I also outside of this group developed a relationship that is not more important or better, but different.  I became friends and quickly more with my next door neighbour in my 3rd year. He was a fresher and I was Lifer as the slang goes. No there was nothing erotic about it, but I found after a year that I had the little brother I had always wanted. In almost everything I liked but my mates didn't, he did. 

I haven't had as much success with the ladies down here as I like, but I've had some so I'm not complaining, just didn't meet the one that I wanted to.

I wasnt the high flyer in School and am still struggling to finish what I started (I only need two more units but cant bring myself to complete them) and am gonna have to finish them up online with the University of London and then transfer them.  I found a great job ($22 an hour, little actual work). 

And I have had fun.  More fun than I thought I could.  The sort of fun you cant plan but spontaneously finds you on the way (he best sort).

All this and more that I cant put into words have made Australia and Tasmania more than simply the place I am, they have become my home, which has been nice for someone who never felt like they had one. 

But all this is coming to an end.  My visa is running out and there was no chance or reason really to get another.  

So I don't so much want out as Its just time to be rambling on. I cant go back to America as I was never a citizen and lost residency for leaving for so long, but that never really bothered me, in fact it made things easier. I'm reminded of the anecdote of Pizarro landing in the new world and burning the ships so his men were motivated forward into what they had come to do. Thats what it was like when I lost residency. I had worried about it until it happened and then it was like a breath of fresh air.

So Monday I'm leaving.  I know the end of the line at moment is London, but I doubt Ill stay in the UK or even tell my family that I'm there.  In fact I plan on being a ferry to Holland before the day is out. Fortunately one of those good mates is in Holland and I have a couch for a while.  So at the moment it looks like my next place at least for a few months is Holland.

I loved Australia and recommend it to anyone who can come down. 

I have been wanting to write this for a while but finally have the reason.  I don't know what the percentages are on here but anyway.  Some of you want out.  Your home is boring or doesn't feel right.  I don't really know what that felt like.  I think I'm something of a minority on here but I think there are at least a few of us, that represent the other side of IWantOut, IWantIn.  Some of us move around for Jobs or experiences. Then there are those who do so because we have never known anything but, with no place to call home other than where we lay our head, searching in vain hope for a place to call home.  Its sad but its liberating. Sometimes I get angry. Why couldn't I have been born raised lived and died in a place I knew was home!  Other times I feel like one of the most liberated people on the planet. I can go anywhere, with nothing tying me down. Its certainly one of the more unique experiences god or the universe has given someone and I do feel lucky sometimes. 

Im not sure Ill ever stop moving or find a home unless I meet the 'one' who is enough reason to stay somewhere and make it my home.  Wish me luck, and good luck to all the other vagabonds out there.

Anyways, I'm hoping you guys could give me some tips and information. It's not that much of a problem to get a student VISA, so my main concern is... Where should I live?

Things I like and prefer: Technology, computers, science, gaming, sports (Football, soccer, basketball), fashion, clothing, live musical events, the outdoors, the sun (I've had enough snow and cold so far).

I've been looking into the places I'm most familiar with. Miami/Florida, California, New York, Washington... So I need a place where I can study, have fun, enjoy the weather, doesn't cost a fortune to live (Especially housing I would assume?) and isn't filled with rednecks :).

1352053969.0,42,self.IWantOut,12me6r,"I got out... and now I have no idea what to do or where to go. I feel LOST (x-post, r/AskReddit).",NuclearTunaSandwich,53,11,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/12me6r/i_got_out_and_now_i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_or/,"Let me preface this by saying, I am happy with my life so far, I am not severely depressed or anything. I am still young, and grateful that this is happening to me at 25 instead of 55. But I know that I am currently floating without a sense of direction, and if I don't figure something out soon, then it's possible that I could be living under a bridge. I feel like I have climbed up a tree but broke all the branches on my way up, so there is nowhere to go and no way to get back down.

I'm a female, 25 years old. I spent 5 years studying theatre at a state university in the U.S. I am good at what I do, I put my heart and soul into my acting studies and I was told on numerous occasions that I was the best student in the department, talent-wise but also in terms of motivation and drive. My professors were encouraging me to apply for the greatest graduate programs in the country. Then I hit a rough patch--depression, end of a long-term relationship, my father suffered from a couple of strokes... and I started doing poorly in my classes. I lost my financial aid.

Now, I only have ONE last class requirement to obtain my degree, but I owe money to my university, am unable to receive financial aid, and therefore I am unable to finish my degree. I literally have one more class to take, JUST ONE, but I would need 3,000 to pay off my current debt and another couple thousand in order to take the class. So I've pretty much scratched that off my list of possibilities, since I don't make enough money to raise that sort of dough by next autumn. The course is even a long-distance learning course, which means I could take it from anywhere in the world, but I totally blew my chance to pass it due to going through a period of depression and lacking motivation to apply myself.

I took a spontaneous solo trip to Europe while going through my bout of depression, I took a great interest in France and, long story short, decided that I wanted to go there. So I did, as an au pair and to obtain my certificate to teach English as a second language (I now have my TEFL certificate). I am now beginning my second year in France working as an au pair, I have a 1-year visa and it expires next September. I currently take French classes and I am slowly paying off the 1500-dollar tuition with each small paycheck. I have until September to figure out what to do with my life, and it's doubtful that I will be able to save up any money.

I have always been a person with extreme drive and motivation, I have a deep love for research and studying, and I am the type of person who masters everything that I put my mind to. I would love to go back to school, but don't know how I could do that in France (or Europe in general) without having thousands of dollars to support myself. I thrive in situations in which I am in charge, or where the environment is constantly changing, and where I can apply myself creatively, but I don't know how to find this sort of work while abroad. I don't know how to find any sort of work while abroad, aside from being an au pair or teaching, both of which do not make me feel happy or fulfilled.

I feel really unlike myself because I suddenly have no idea what to do or where to go. I want to continue living in Europe (France in particular) after this year, but I don't know how to do that except by being an au pair. I don't want to be an au pair anymore, childcare is not and never has been my dream. There are so many things that I could do and be happy doing them because I am a person with many interests. More than anything, I'd love to go back to theatre, but I'm not even sure how to get into auditions here in France. My French is not fluent yet. The original reason why I wanted to come to France was to study theatre at a particular school in Paris, but I don't have the money and the school does not have a financial aid system. I feel... fucked, with nowhere to turn.

Any sort of advice in any way would be greatly appreciated. Maybe you've been in a similar situation, or know someone that has. Maybe you know something that I don't.

**TL;DR: I was obtaining a degree, got depressed, failed my classes, lost financial aid, don't have the money to take the very last course that would grant me my B.A. in Theatre. Working as an au pair in France, not really happy, need to develop a goal to work towards, but I have no sense of direction and don't know where to start my search. Wish I could continue my work in theatre, no idea how. Wish I could go back to school to research anything, really.**",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,1352066041.0,,,True,t3_12me6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/12me6r/i_got_out_and_now_i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_or/,

I dont think it really matters what country I try to run to, the world economy will find me wherever I go so that I will forever be working more for less and less.  I need about $250k or so to escape the economy completely but in order to get that money I will either have to tie myself to the economy and working 5 days a week for the next 20 years or do something illegal.  If I borrow the money then my whole plan does not work as I need the time to build my house and set up my garden to support me and my family.  I am planning on building an earthship with a permiculture garden, about 20 chooks and a couple of sheep and pigs.

Plan looks like this:

$100k for 5 acres of land
$10k for a second hand digger (about 10 - 15 ton)
$20k for a kitset garage
$20k for solar power
$80k for basic earthship parts, this will vary a lot depending on whether I can find recycled wood and glass.
$10k for plumbing/water storage
$10k composting toilet and septic system
$10k for diesel/gas and other things I have not thought of.

I am planning to put up the kitset garage first with the solar system on its roof to power the build of the main house, we will live in the garage until the house is ready, the digger should speed things along when it comes to making the house and sculpting the garden to suit permiculture, I used to drive a 10 ton bulldozer part time so a digger should be easy enough to pick up.

What have I forgotten?  Permits?  Is there anything else I need to consider other than food etc while I build everything?

Alternatively, if you have moved to the US, what things should I be aware of in the process?

On that note, I am relatively lucky as I will be moving to a great job in San Fransisco, on a L1A visa.

Takeaways so far:

* I am lucky to be moving to San Francisco. 
* However stay out of the Tenderloin
* **Take an extra look at my health-insurance, chances are it's less than optimal.**
* Public transport is bad, but I should be ok'ish in San Francisco.
* US is great... if your are successful, preferably in a big city.

One idea that I had which was also the idea of a number of other people, was to purchase the island of Isla Guafo in Southern Chile.  It is far enough off shore and it has the size. It is about the size of Washington DC including Arlington and Alexandria, VA.  It has the climate of Maine or Vancouver.  It is lush with Natural Resources and it use to be for sale for a mere $7M.  Then they found rich coal deposits and it has been leased to Chile's larges coal energy company.  BUt it doesn't mean it couldn't still be purchased. 

So all you have to do is level a runway, dig some roads, set up a fish processing plant, a wood pulp and sawmill and start colonizing.  As long as 30% of the island stays as a natural reserve, chile was willing to sell it.  THe island also has geothermal energy and is sitting in one of the worlds riches fishery locations.  It is also right along the shipping lanes for boats heading to Antarctica and Patagonia for research and tourism. Could be a stopping point with the right port.

I have about USD $7,000 in the bank and I want *out*.

A few weeks back I contacted this professor who is an immigration proponent and asked him what would be the best way to get back into the U.S. He said, very matter of factly, to come in on a tourist Visa and just hunt for work.

Even before he recommended this to me, I was thinking about doing something like it. I have a friend on the West Coast who said I could crash at his for awhile. I know there's a large Asian-American population on the West Coast, so perhaps I would be able to find a sympathetic ear.

I first left the UK at 27 more or less on a whim because I was offered a contract in Switzerland and I thought ""skiing every weekend"". I loved it and stayed for 3 years before going back to the UK. Now I'm 45 and I've spent the last 11 years in Brazil where I've two children now 7 and 9. In these 11 years I've been the victim of a home invasion (armed gang in my house, tied up me + family) and twice victim of ""lightening kidnapping"" (basically a carjack / kidnap where you get driven to a bank ATM at gunpoint to take out cash). Brazil is a beautiful country and I love it but lately it's just getting too dangerous, seems to be getting worse with crack-junkies with guns not caring about consequences and people being assaulted in daylight, people we know being killed in carjacks; I don't want my kids to grow up with this violence (crime + traffic accident deaths). I live in Rio Grande do Sul which is considered one of the safest states.

Our two top options right now are Australia (Sydney or Gold Coast) and USA (likely Florida, or perhaps California if we can afford it). Reasons:
- climate
- culture similar to our own
- crime stats
- education
- prospects
- language
Some of you might question the whole gun crime thing in the USA, but I tell you compared to Brazil it's nothing.

USA is slightly ahead on location grounds for visiting family (Brazil/UK). My wife and I speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, German and the kids just the first 3 but we'd be fine even in Spanish speaking areas like Miami.

I have very marketable skills but would probably go for an investment / entrepreneur visa and start some import / export business using my contacts in Brazil. Australia might prove more difficult as they have the 45 age barrier to some visa types.

Selling up everything here (hot property market and relatively strong currency is a help) will put around USD 2M in the bank.

Does anyone have first hand experience, advice, anecdotes of moving a family of this age to AUS or USA?

It does seem like this provides Celta certification,  but prepares you for the TKT. Is this worth the time and money of someone with vague plans to teach English abroad in a non-English speaking country? 

The Groupon description: 
Like a pair of toy handcuffs, language unites people, and like a pair of cuffs with a missing key, the language bond can last a lifetime. Forge linguistic connections with today's Groupon: for $79, you get a 120-hour Advanced Certificate online course from TESOL Express (a $599 value).

TESOL Express equips English-speaking tongues to teach one of the world's most useful lexicons to non-English-speaking students. Advanced Certificate classes prepare learners to pass the internationally recognized Teaching Knowledge Test at their leisure with sessions available online at any time of day, which can open doors to securing English-teaching jobs around the world. Budding lexicographers pack their knowledge receptacles with lessons that break down the English language into digestible morsels, as well as with the fundamentals of lesson planning and classroom management. TESOL Express's specialist modules, which are elective courses that reveal tips for teaching young learners and managing large classes, keep soon-to-be teachers' minds as agile as a cheetah on a televised dancing competition. Additionally, a personal tutor is on hand to shepherd students through the course.

After successfully completing the course, students receive the TESOL Advanced Certificate, which they can then fold into a paper airplane and throw at a globe to divine their future teaching destination. Alternatively, a contact database allows graduates to search thousands of language schools around the world to discern their ideal location. For more details, check the [FAQ page here.](http://www.tesolexpressonline.com/pages/TESOL_Express_FAQ)

**Update:** Well I pulled the trigger. The consensus (here and on other forums) seems to be:

A. The course won't teach you much at all, definitely won't leave you prepared to teach English to speakers of other languages. There's no in class practice, nor supervised teaching.

B. In much of the world the certificate you'll receive for this course won't get anywhere. The school is self-accredited, whatever that means, and in some places this certification won't get you doodly squat.

C. In other parts of the world, especially Asia, there are companies that just want a piece of paper, something that says you have some sort of qualifications. That's worth my $79 right there. 

D. Finally, the course supposedly prepares you to take the Teaching Knowledge Test (although it doesn't include it) which *is* internationally recognized and is accredited by Cambridge.

I'm here in London since the second week of June, and I'm living a roller coaster of emotions; sad to say, this roller coaster never goes up enough, and pretty much every night leaves me crying alone in my shitty room, and that's it.

I think that if you are not after a qualified job (that is to say a job that requires a degree and that you have experience in), you can't move out. Nowadays, it seems you can't even think of living on your own. It's sad, it's thoroughly sad.

Goddamit, here it's full of vacancies! One out of three shops has a ""looking for sale assistant/waiter"" outside. And I can't understand who and how is chosen for these jobs, because I've met far too many sale assistants with great difficulties in understanding even the simpler of the questions, while I have to use my pretty good English just to say ""fries are ready"" in a fucking McDonald's, paid 4£/hour after taxes, which you know is a ridiculous amount if you even dare to rent and take the tube here in London.

I'm deeply sorry because my girlfriend was coming after me; it was an heavy decision for her to take, and now I think I'll have to tell her ""Hey, I'm sorry, let's not do it"". But you know, I turned 20 one week ago, and I have a good amount of money left in my bank account; if I think that I have the choice between going back to my sunny country, spending a summer drinking with my girlfriend and having dinner ready at home, etc. etc., and staying here, with this ridiculously crappy weather (ok, I know, it's the most rainy summer since 1795 or whatever, but come on), working like a slave to afford a room where the other flatmates don't even bother flushing after taking a dump...

Fuck it guys. I guess I'm doomed. I understand this is my future, staying in a crappy kitchen of a restaurant and living in a shithole, furthermore in a doomed country which is Italy where I'm going back, but ok, let's make him wait.

13 years ago, my mom forcibly relocated us kids here to America to live with our dad. I am a Canadian citizen, but my dad is a US citizen.

I've been stuck in this legal limbo (Originally from Somalia,  came to the states as a small child under asylum, left to move to Canada under different name and became citizen, returned here and live under asylum status with original name. Confusing, I know) ever since. 

It's basically impossible for me to stay here now because the path to a green card expired many years ago. I have a degree that is essentially worthless now because no one will hire me. I can't walk in to the Canadian embassy because I have no documents to prove who I am. Luckily I'm positive that I can at the least return to Canada under my asylum identity and from there restart my life. I don't mind having to redo school and Uni 

I need to know what steps I need to take to begin climbing back into University. I have a business degree now and Im sure I can do it all over again, no problem. I know of the Canadian GED program. But then what? Is there a community college? Is it possible to just skip right into Univeristy after the exam? It's been so long since I've been in school in Canada (left after 9th grade) that I forgot what steps there are. 

I was looking at Centennial College (I'll be in Toronto or Calgary, but preferably Toronto. There website is confusing me. Is there a way to transfer from there into a 4 year school (ex. UofT or Ryerson)?

Please help. I'm under severe stress and have been gloomily thinking of sucide these past few months. This is the only ray of light I have left. Otherwise, my life will be working fast food (got student loans too) and  basically a life of poverty.

PS. This is a throwaway account. I came here a couple of months ago to ask but forgot my login details.

* **High School Diploma**;

* Languages: Excellent **Italian**, flawless **English** (well, it usually takes me 2 days to totally lose the accent, then I assure you, it's perfect - **ESOL certificate**, if it helps);

* Experience: **customer service** (really handy guy, but just the basics: ""Need help? - Oh yes, let me check if we have a shirt of that color""); **waiter** (clean the tables and the ground, take orders, bring dishes, etc.); **data entries** (worked as coordinator in a delivery agency; take the calls, put datas in PC, assign to deliver-boy); **Graphic/Web Design** (I'm a freelance, self-taught, now attending an online course. Being hired as a trainee/apprentice/junior Designer would be my dream);

“When I was very young and the urge to be someplace else was on me, I was assured by mature people that maturity would cure this itch. When years described me as mature, the remedy prescribed was middle age. In middle age I was assured hat greater age would calm my fever and now that I am fifty-eight perhaps senility will do the job. Nothing has worked. Four hoarse blasts of a ship’s whistle still raise the hair on my neck and set my feet tapping. The sound of a jet, an engine warming up, even the clopping of shod hooves on pavement brings on the ancient shudder, the dry mouth and vacant eye, the hot palms and the churn of stomach high up under the rib cage. In other words, I don’t improve; in further words, once a bum always a bum. I fear disease is incurable. I set this matter down not to instruct others but to inform myself.

When the virus of restlessness begins to take possession of a wayward man, and the road away from Here seems broad and straight and sweet, the victim must first find in himself a good and sufficient reason for going. This to the practical bum is not difficult. He has a built-in garden of reasons to choose from. Next he must plan his trip in time and space, choose a direction and a destination. And last he must implement the journey. How to go, what to take, how long to stay. This part of the process is invariable and immortal. I set it down only so that newcomers to bumdom, like teen-agers in new hatched sin, will not think that they invented it.

Once a journey is designed, equipped, and put in process, a new factor enters and takes over. A trip, a safari, an exploration, is an entity, different from all journeys. It has personality, temperament, individuality, uniqueness. A journey is a person in itself; not two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless. We find after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us. Tour masters, schedules, reservations, brass-bound and inevitable, dash themselves to wreckage on the personality of the trip. Only when this is recognized can the blow-in-the-glass bum relax and go along with it. Only when do the frustrations fall away. In this
a journey is like marriage. The certain way to be wrong is to think you control it. I feel better now, having said this, although only those who have experienced it will understand.”",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,False,,,True,t3_q1yk8,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/q1yk8/chills_every_time/,

I wasn't born here in the first place, so I don't have a patriotic affinity to this country, and politically speaking, my sensibilities align much more with a Scandinavian outlook than an American one.  I realize I'm probably going to get the usual ""They don't want you"" flak, but quite frankly, it's starting to seem like the US doesn't want me either.  I'm also currently living in Syracuse, so the winters don't really scare me anymore.

I have a Poli-sci Bachelors from Princeton University, which could help give me an edge when it comes to employment, but who knows.  I'm also currently finishing up the final semester of my Masters in Library and Information Science (with a certificate in Digital Libraries which basically overlays XML, database, and IT on top of a library context).  Basically, I have some skills, I just don't know if they're good enough to make it a simple transition.

It is my impression that the United States no longer values the idea of sharing knowledge for the common good, and the state of librarianship in this country is a dubious affair.  It is an aging profession that needs to modernize in order to survive, but that impetus to modernize is being choked by overzealous protection of intellectual property at the behest of moneyed powers.  I won't go into it too deeply, but basically, from what I have read, the Scandinavian countries (aside from all the things I already admired) really value their libraries, and are embracing the transition to digital forms of knowledge-sharing.  One of my classmates had guest speakers from Finland and Sweden skype into lecture, and tell them about the libraries they worked at, and she said she pretty much fell in love with them, but would never be able to leave the US.  

I want to explore the possibility of visiting at least one of these countries first and then deciding whether a move would be possible, but I'm not sure which would be the easiest transition.  Just as a quick-and-dirty summary, what are the main differences between the three, in terms of things I might not know just by browsing wikipedia?   (I wouldn't pass up Denmark or Netherlands either but I'm looking at the big 3 first.)

Consider a developing nation.,justmejeff,47,11,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/iyd6r/want_out_consider_a_developing_nation/,"Just wanted to throw this out there. I lived in Canada for 25 years and moved here to the Dominican Republic about 2.5 years ago.

I think there might be a mindset that says DR = Haiti and many imagine extreme poverty, health and government issues. This is not (always) the case.

*Personal Backgroud*: I had it easy considering I transferred with my employer when our client needed to find a low cost solution (I work with an international contact center company doing online PR and Marketing). I came to the country for 8 months ""all expenses paid"" and helped setup the call center part of the business (training representatives). This gave me a chance to explore the country as a ""millionaire"", since I was making Canadian Dollars and had no expenses. Obviously I saved a ton of money in that time also.
I ""officially"" transferred to a job here in August 2010 and took a severe pay-cut as well (I really couldn't continue to make as much as my boss ;) ). I have no regrets.

PROS: 

* **No visa, residency required.** If you come here don't expect a to hop into a career right away. Many ex-pats are working in call center type environments. Don't let this discourage you, as you will make higher then average income because of your English skills.

* **Drinking in the streets.** I know Reddit likes its booze ;)

* **The people.** Of course, this will vary in your experience, but most people here that you would meet (knowing only English) are really friendly and genuinely WANT to engage with you. 

CONS:

* **Lifestyle.** Obviously, you will not live as well as you did in NA/EU. My first apartment didn't have hot water for example. Some locations will have power for only 12 hours a day. You have to budget well if you are coming with little savings. 

* **Mindset.** Obviously Latin American culture (and island culture) is much different. You will never assimilate here, you are always a guest (which is better then a tourist!). If you can't adapt (or don't want to) this isn't the place for you.

I just returned to the US after five years. I am only visiting. But every day I have been back I remember why I left in the first place.

There are things I love about the US, but in general being back is scary and people are more desperate than I remember. It feels like things are just getting worse. There is this sense of *every man for himself* that doesn't exist in my new country.

Americans (aside from the /r/iwantout crowd) don't realize that their society is broken. So there is know way for them to understand what they need to shoot for or how to rebuild it.

I met this girl today from Ukraine when I went to rent a car. She has lived here for a couple years and works at the car rental place. When she was walking me out to the car she asked me how long I was going to be in the US, I told here maybe a few months, but heading back to my new home soon. (safer, better standard of living, etc., etc.). She looked me dead in the eyes and with conviction in her voice said, ""this place scares me. everything is so poorly made. I don't feel safe here. People here don't see how bad it is and they aren't working to make it better. I am leaving in a couple years.""

Keep in mind, she is from Ukraine. She came here for a better life. Now she wants out too. If nothing else she validated my emotions when I returned.

It is impossible to change the masses to see what the problems are. There is no way to get people to stop worrying about abortion, women's contraception, or more wars. The media, the politicians, everyone is moving along with a momentum that will not slow down in our life time.

My only advice for all of you Americans wanting to escape: start thinking of yourself as a visitor. This will make it easier for you to distance yourself and stay focused on relocating.

I am 15 years old, turning 16 soon, and I want to go somewhere else for a while when I'm older. I know things may change by the time I am old enough to travel, but I just want some basic advice on what I can do now to achieve my goal and want to know if you guys think it could work out. I want to live in Germany. I'm from Canada, I come from a very loving, upper middle class family so it's not that I want to get out because of family trouble or problems with my country's economy. I just want to experience a different culture, live an interesting life and have some stories to tell. 

I plan to go to university after high school and my parents definitely expect me to. I enjoy science and want a career in something that has to do with astronomy. I speak both English and French fluently and I'm beginning to learn German. As I said earlier, I have a great family and I wouldn't want to leave them behind forever, so I don't plan for this to be permanent. I don't *need* to live in Germany, I just want to live somewhere in Europe (or possibly Asia) and since I find their culture and language very nice I kind of decided on Germany. 

I hope this information wasn't too vague for you guys, I'm not asking you guys to come up with a complete plan of everything I should do to get there, just tell me if you think I'm wrong in wanting to do this, or what I should do, etc. Thanks  :)

After recovering I clawed my way through recovery, re-trained myself in a new industry, obtained a Associates Degree in Applied Science, graduated with Honors. Worked for a Health Care Corporation for 10 years, was promoted 3 times. However my damaged spinalcord haunted me, despite working for a Healthcare company they failed to care for my needs. In 2009 it became obvious I would not be able to work through the pain any longer. Applied for Social Security Disability, TWO years later I was finally approved. After two years with out my income we lost our house, and our way of life. I can not explain the frustration of trying to fight through the pain and get the health care I need. Despite now having Medicare that certainly does not solve the problem. One example, my actual cost of prescription drugs for pain management is over $1,000 a month. Which means I will be in their donut hole of coverage in just over 5 months. For those that don't know what that means for several months I will have to pay out of pocket for the entire cost of those drugs till I reach the maximum out of pocket number. When you are on a fixed income, that is nearly impossible. I just want my health and my life back. I desperately want to go back to work in the career I love. It has been clear I can't do that in this Country under the current Health Care state. Is their a Country out there that would care enough to help me get my health back and be a productive member of their country?

Edit: Just to clarify, I certainly don't feel that America destroyed my life. This is the land of my Family, the land of my birth. The Health Care in this Country is the problem. Fighting for months to see a Specialist, only to have 15 minutes with the Doctor to review 16 years of medical problems does not work. I believed Health Care worked here too, till I needed it. If you have a major health problem, one you have to become your own Advacate, two you have to know as much or more than the Doctors about your paticular health issue, three you have to speak with authority and demand what you need or they will pat you on the head and send you away with a little perscription.

1268212717.0,29,self.IWantOut,bbix0,Avoiding some of the culture shock - how it works in Sweden and why.,vonadler,33,4,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/bbix0/avoiding_some_of_the_culture_shock_how_it_works/,"Hi all. I have seen a few IamAs and selfs here that describe a massive culture shock between ango-saxon societies and Sweden. I am Swedish, but lived in Ireland for a year and a half and worked at a US corporation and I know some of the differences that can make coming to Sweden a real shock to ango-saxons (mostly Americans). I'll list a few things and let you ask questions.

Note that many of the things I list are valid for ""established"" people, ie those over 20, having a job and their own home. Among college students, young and people living alternative lifestyles, I don't know enough anymore (I am 30 now) to say what goes.

Making contact. Swedes are afraid of conflict, contact and things that deviate from the social norm in their every-day dealings. Note that when the every-day deviates from the norm, so can social interaction. People talk and help each other in blizzards, when the subway is hopelessly late etc. But normally, you don't talk to people on the bus, in the subway, in the line at McDonald's or other everyday places. Swedes socialise and meet new people in circumstances where you go to socialise. Bars, pubs, parties, when being introduced to people and in clubs and societies.

You will probably feel very isolated if you go here, so here's a few tips.
If you have a friend, ask him or her to introduce you into their social cirkle. ""Hänga på"" (join in) in informal social events is common. You'll be introduced and expected to talk a bit about yourself and ask questions about the others. If you find you have common interests with someone, try to pump them for information about where you can partake in that interest. Chances are there's an association or a social group doing it that will allow you to join and meet even more people.

Be aware though that you should probably not ask directly if you can join in. Since Swedes are non-confrontative, it puts the other person in an uncomfortable position. The correct way to do something like this is to ask questions about the event and say that it sounds like fun and you wish you could do something like that. Either you'll be invited or your hints will be ignored, which spares the other person of confronting you with a direct no.

Which brings me to the next point, social interaction. Swedes are very non-confrontative and rarely ask or reply indirectly if it is a negative. Instead, problems are or confrontative people are ignored. You can see it with field sales reps trying to attract people in a mall, with an empty rign around them in a crowded space and people looking the other way pretending not to see or hear. Same thing if an alcoholic or disturbed person talks loudly on the bus - people look the other way and pretend not to hear. Normally, most people can pick up the ignore-vibes and know that the subject is not wanted and move on to other topics without glitches in the social oil.

Swedes are rather nationalistic, but not in the flag-waving gung-ho type way. We like to think our welfare is the best, our society the least corrupted, our summers the brightest, our nature the finest, ur culture the most peculiar and our industry the greatest. In many cases our standards are high, in other cases we tend to become insular and arrogant, especially in some parts of the countryside. In short, we can whine about things in Sweden, you can't. Not very fair, but if you want to fit in, that is how it is. You can point out differences and complain about the darkness and mya funny anecdotes about culture clashes, but you cannot whine about Sweden. If you do, people will smile a bit stiffly, start to ignore you and think ""We'll why did he come if he did not like it?""

Sweden is very eligaterean. Few thigns piss people off like people flaunting their wealth and being arrogant about it. Modesty is a virtue. Bragging is considered impolite and jockying for position uncivilised. You are allowed to be successful as long as you are modest about it. A few weeks ago we had a blizzard in Stockholm and the subway had to lose down. The replacement buses were too few and people crowded up trying to get home from work. At Liljeholmen, about 1000 people tried to get on the buses and one man forced himself in front of a young mother with a child. When she protested, he said something along the lines of ""the right of the strong"". Another man then went up to him, punched him the face and told him ""you're evidently not that strong, get to the end of the line!"". 

Weed. It is illegal to be under influence of illegal substances in Sweden. The police can forcibly bring you to the station and test you if they think you might be under influence. While many Swedes think it is your business and no-one elses what you smoke, having a too drug-liberal stance will make you deviate from the social norm.  Stoners are viewed as ""peculiar"" people with little ambition and work ethics. Smoking indoors, tobacco or other stuff is a ground to evict you from a rental contract in most places - you are destroying the paint/wallpapers with your smoke and if you are not evicted, you will surely be asked to replace them at your own expense when you move out.

Swedes take off thier shoes when they come indoors in private homes. In offices and public buildings, where a cleaning firm handle taking care of all the water, sand and gravel that is brought in during 3 of the 4 seasons, it is not needed. Many Swedish homes have beautiful wooden floors that are ruinged by gravel, hard heels and black rubber sole shoes. If you feel uncomfortable going around shoeless, you can bring indoor shoes that you change to, just make sure your host is aware that you do use indoor shoes.",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,False,,,True,t3_bbix0,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/bbix0/avoiding_some_of_the_culture_shock_how_it_works/,

Oh my god. Leaving my country forever? Can I do that? Will I ever fit in abroad? I didn't feel ready to make that kind of commitment - but maybe I never would. Maybe this was the best time?

So, expats, were you ready to leave when it happened? Did you sing and dance your way down the jetway? Were you scared you were making a huge mistake? Did you not really think about it much?

People always say that's a good quality to have... and maybe it is.
I am a 16 and a half year old male born (unfortunately) in Paraguay, still living there. I finished high school at 12 (nothing special, high school is pretty damn easy here, and you can finish it early if you're not a lazy bastard, besides I didn't have much of a normal life, let's say I finished both school and high school without actually going to classes). After graduating in 2009 I entered into the biggest university of the country, with 13 (I lived in the capital), to study a career that I realized I didn't like 2 years later, I was studying Electric Engeneering, and I was doing terrible, I didn't study enough and spent my hours playing games at home. Before turning 15 I realized 

I was an idiot, and in those past years I never really thinked about my future and what I really want to do in life, I didn't care about anything. My father got a very well-paid job (relatively) in 2011 in another city, so we moved there. This is when this bad feeling on me started. I began going into another university wanting to study a career I knew I liked (Informatic Engeneering) this time, turns out the university doesn't have it, and the ones who have it are very small, poor, no really worthy universities (and even good universities are awful in Paraguay). So instead I began Computer Science, not a huge deal, really, but it's something that bothers me.
The thing is, I absolutely despise everything about the place, and not just the city, the whole country, since I moved here I started to see how wrong everything was, you see, Paraguay is an awful place, full of hateful, ignorant and stupid people (consequences of poberty I guess), at least in the capital, there are a few people who share my interests, even if they are very little, but in the city I am currently living, is hell.

I'm not sure how can I describe it with writing, try to imagine... a favela in brazil, now imagine it as big as a city, and awful city, where everything is wrong, awful people, full of poberty, ignorance, awful organization, awful streets, awful houses, awful traffic, awful noise, and it's a small city, in the middle of nowhere, and there's nothing in it, apart from some companies and shopping center, there's really no other place for entertainment here, no cinema, no theater, no good recreational areas, there's nothing to do here, seriously, it makes me laugh sometimes. And I don't want to stay here, I want to escape from here, I want to go somewhere else, that's all I want, I can't stop thinking about it, every day, I feel like I can't take it anymore. I need a new life, and I fear this will become worse if I go on like this. I realized that I never been truly happy in my life, never before, I know that if I could just go somewhere else, a nice city in a good country, meet nice people, and study in a good university I would be the happiest person, I just want to have that oportunity, but it seems I can't, and this is killing me.

I know I sound like a crybaby, if someone told me this, I would probably just say ""get over yourself man"" or something, but I'm really not ok, this is not something I can deal with, I would not be writing this if I wasn't truly desperate. I feel like it's not fair, I have so many dreams and things I love, and I just can't see myself achieving them as long as I'm here at this country, I want to start a new life now.
And I honestly can't see myself wasting more years here, already been here almost two years, and they have been the worst years of my life. I don't think what I feel is depression, I think depression is worse, but it's very overwhelming, and if I keep going like this I'm sure I will enter into that stage :( And I hate having this feeling every damn day since I wake up until I go to sleep again, I feel like nothing I'm doing matters, I just want to curl up and cry all day, well, I actually do it some times. I'm writing this as a last resort, asking for advice in the internet most times is anyway, I just need some advice from anyone. All I want is just to have a chance to go study in a nice country, in a nice university, just that will make me so so happy. Maybe Argentina or Uruguay, don't see the other countries being better than Paraguay, really. But my real desire is to go to a really good country, like the UK or Canada. But I have no idea how to do this, it's not fair, I know I am capable of a lot of things, but I am stuck here in this country just because I was born here.

I love Europe, the cities, the places, the history, the culture, the people, all countries has its problems yes, but I feel like Europe (most of it) are the best countries to live, and how a country should really be in this century and decade... but not South America, not Central America or Africa, and I had the back luck to be born in the first. And I don't know what I do if I just keep getting stucked here. This is not just whim, this is a need for me. I need to get out of here to be the person I want to be, and be happy.

Now the reason I'm posting this here is because I need some advice on how to achieve this. How to go study into another country? Just get out from here, and go to a good country. I had a perfect score in all of school and high school, surely that counts for someting? Some scholarship? My father's base salary is around 1550$, but he does extra hours, so he ears around 3000$ monthly, but there can be some times when he can't do extra hours, so just ears the base salary. But apparently, according to my parents, this isn't enought to move to Buenos Aires (the closest place I would like to llive) and study there (bugger).

I speak English and Spanish, so my choices are kinda limited to just Argentina, maybe Urugay, Canada, the US, the UK and Spain I guess. My absolutely dream place to live is the UK, hardly the best place in the world I'm sure, but better than all those other choices.

I probably sound like a complaining moron right now, I'm not very good at writing about how I feel, just consider when I say I feel bad, that I feel VERY bad.

So how can I move from here? How can I go study to another country? I'm so desperate right now. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Maybe get a scholarship, maybe go to an embassy and beg to take me as a student? Save money?

Any advice, just anything, I would really appreciate, thank you :(

AMA.,courters,39,9,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/19j3ve/iama_american_coming_up_on_6_years_in_europe_who/,"Not sure if this will gather much interest, but here are my vital statistics:

* Six years in June. Started in Paris where I worked for a fashion company out of the gate. I was between Paris and London. The Eurostar was my time off. I 100% got a visa due to nepotism. 
* Transferred to Budapest. Left the company to work for a destination services provider. Did that, switched to another one in Budapest. DSP work was as office manager, HR generalist, RFP/RFI (bids and tender process), and coordinator for accounts. DSP's handle the immigration and relocation work for incoming expats belonging to major corporations; ie, we'd settle and deal with the local immigration of, say, a Coca-Cola employee in any of the locations our company had the contract.
* Moved from Budapest back to the UK (this time to Birmingham), where I worked in-house global mobility for expatriates departing the UK for continental positions with the company and America. 
* Now in Tallinn, Estonia because my partner is the expat, wha-hey! He is a computer programmer who works for a shiny company that starts with S and was acquired by Microsoft. He is British. I freelance and consult in the field.
* I make mistakes and I love this subreddit because people are able to fill in the gaps. I know the Hungarian local immigration the best, but I worked with Hungary, the UK, the USA, and now, in order: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Greece (very, very rarely), Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russia (hands up, I still don't understand it and dreaded and still do when I have Russian work), Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Ukraine! We contracted work to Finland, Norway, and Sweden, and I have quoted for them in terms of immigration and services, but know more about incoming expats from there than people going there. I dealt with people of all nationalities entering and exiting, quite a lot of Americans. In my capacity, I saw what positions most expatriates were in and the businesses we did work with. Because of confidentiality, I cannot name companies, but I am happy to report industries. Ie; Finance is a great industry, there are a lot of accountants moved around and English is key. 
* Education: BA in History from an Ivy, MA in History (if you want to know: it's on genocide). No one, I repeat *no one* has cared about where I acquired my BA from. Employers have delighted in my MA, but are not interested, really, in my subject.
* I speak English, Czech, and German. My French has drastically diminished, but that's a conversation for linguistics! Hungarian, poorly, but excellently when I am drunk (as is the way with Hungarian!), and very, very bad to non-existent Estonian. My father is from the Czech Republic, but I do NOT possess citizenship; however, I am going to go through the process very soon. I haven't needed it. 

Working for a DSP is great as is working in-house. I have dealt with expatriates on both ends: both on the ground or incoming, and on the ground and departing. I worked for a service provider first, which made me an attractive candidate for in-house mobility management; a facet of HR for anyone interested. Why? Because I understood the processes so I was able to offer unique insight. This cinched my visa in the UK. I am very lucky to be in my field and will happily answer any questions I can about trends for expatriates and what life is like, as an American, in Budapest, the UK, or Tallinn.

All of my searches have yielded a plethora of placement organizations that connect you with opportunities with NGOs on the ground. But I'm finding such placement organizations have a lot of negative reviews as they essentially cut ties with you once you're on the ground. Once they have your money, that's it. I would feel much more comfortable connecting directly with the NGO rather than going through these placement organizations. But it's impossible to find such NGOs with searching online! On another note, financing is not an issue. I understand many volunteer opportunities require the participant to pay to cover living and travel expenses and I have no problem doing that.

I've applied to an engineering school there, and will hopefully get accepted after taking the entrance exam in Finland. If I do then I have to prove I have 6000 Euros(proof of living expenses), along with health insurance when I go to apply for the student visa(250 Euros)....in New York City. I live in Ga. The test is April 25th and they don't tell the results until the middle of June. So I have to go to New York, apply, wait a few weeks, and then fly back to Finland again to stay. Anyway - I don't know any banks that are willing to give a student loan to study abroad at a tuition free school. It's funny because banks will give you ~50k no problemo if you go to a school here in the states or any tuition costing school. Or even a living expense loan, as long as the school is on their ""list of schools"" but mine is not. I realize they don't want to give it to me to put directly in my bank account. But what is stopping me from taking a loan from my previous school tuition for an insane amount, then taking whats left and just using it to go to Finland. I'm trying to avoid this option and in reality I don't even have enough time to do it. I cannot take a personal loan because I have no one to cosign with me nor do I have any credit.The thing is, it would COST MORE for me to finish my program HERE in Ga than it would to go to Finland and study for 3.5 years. Also, I have around 3 years left, and I refuse to live here for the rest of that. I would burst. Even if I don't get accepted, I still want to move there. But that means I would need to have a legal marriage for a resident permit, and I'm not sure how my girl's family would feel about that. Finland does not give permits based on engagement either, unless you've been living together; which we haven't been. I would be happier working a 9-5 flipping burgers(no offense to burger flippers) at a McDonalds in Finland than living here. My family is ignorant and not supportive at all, and I have no friends, no car anymore. I live at home and cannot leave. It's making me deeply depressed. I feel I am imprisoned here. I want out.

English (American) is my only language. No criminal convictions.

I'm considering the idea of living abroad temporarily (2-3 years) while continuing to work and further my career.  I have visited several countries where I think this could work: Norway, Sweden (preferred), the UK, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand.

I'm pretty sure that if I were in my 20s or 30s, I wouldn't have any trouble finding interesting work abroad.  However, at my age, I haven't the faintest clue whether or not this would be possible.

Any pointers would be appreciated, especially from older Americans living abroad.

Running through my head the obvious question is ""why don't you just stop moving?""

Hey all. I'm an American citizen interested in immigrating to the Netherlands for the purpose of finding work and living. I am male, 24 years old, and a graduate of the University of Tennessee business school with a bachelor degree in Logistics and Marketing. My job skills are marginally relevant at best- I've only ever had summer jobs, either waiting tables or working in a factory- nothing related to my degree. The type of work I end up in really isn't a big concern for me, as I found my degree area rather boring; I'm willing to take pretty much any work that would allow me a reasonable amount to live on. True to the American form I can only speak English (4 years of Latin in high school doesn't really help), although I am very eager to learn a new language. Basically, I'm 1) Sick of America, and 2) Of the mind that it's impossible to have a perspective on anything if you've lived in one place your entire life, so I want to get out for a few years at least. 

**Where to move**

I've been researching a move to Western Europe for over a year now, more so now that I've graduated and been unable to find a decent job. The Netherlands is my first choice (Amsterdam specifically), but I am definitely willing to consider other options in Western Europe if the Netherlands is impractical for whatever reason. My current top picks after NL are Belgium or Czech Republic, but again, I'm not dead set on anything at this point except moving out of the US. The move will be permanent, as I plan to stay no less than 2 years (potentially more, but I try to keep my plans as open as possible since nobody knows what will happen in 2 years).

**Why I chose the Netherlands**

* Egalitarian culture

* Friendliness of the Dutch in general, particularly with regard to foreigners

* The fact that the Dutch are so good at English (better than most Americans in my experience), which seems like it would make the transition easier as I learn Dutch

* Lots of museums, art, old buildings, and other cultural attractions (speaking of Amsterdam specifically, only city in NL I've been to)

* I wouldn't need a car

**And finally, my questions**

1) According to the ‘Residence in the Netherlands’ document ([link](http://english.ind.nl/Images/ind4012-vvn-eng_tcm111-326109.pdf)), I will not need an MVV (Regular Provisional Residence Permit) since I am a US citizen. I will, however, need to register with the Municipal Administration (GBA) for my place of residence when I arrive. I am wondering what the best course of action would be regarding registration with the GBA, since I won’t be able to look for housing until I am in the country. 

2) Next I will need to apply for a Residence Permit at the IND desk after 3 months. But, as I understand it, I will also need to arrange for a Work Permit with an employer in the Netherlands in order to gain a Residence Permit. Since I do not currently have a contract with a Dutch employer, will this pose a problem in finding work, since I will not yet have a residence permit? 

3) Will I need to take the Civic Integration Examination if I don’t need an MVV? And if so, will this need to be successfully completed before I arrive in the Netherlands?

4) What are the options like for teaching English in the NL? I feel like I have a good command of the English language and would be able to pass any proficiency tests no problem. And since I don't yet speak Dutch, I would likely be placed with more advanced students where the curriculum would consist mainly of carrying on a regular conversation in English (per a family friend who taught English in China). Might this be an option?

Thanks in advance for any help. I tried to keep this as short as possible, but didn't want to leave anything out that might be important, so I can fill in more details wherever necessary.

Here are some of mine (I am aware I still may encounter some of these problems in other nations however I couldn't imagine having all of them in a place I would want to go). Oh and I currently live in the United States.

War, this is one of the biggest reasons. The US goes to war every five minutes or at least it seems that way.

Lack of Universal Healthcare.

Way too many conservatives. I can't tell you how many times I have been harassed and in some cases even threatened by conservatives because I'm liberal.

Circumcision, I can't believe something so bizarre and barbaric could exist in a first world nation. The only nation on my list of potential moves that practices this at all (besides Jews and Muslim minorities) is Canada and even there it is a much lower rate (around 14% now as opposed to US average of 50%).

The US has terrible sex education and extremely high STD rates. I had to explain to an adult man that girls start there period around the age of 12 (he thought it was 18). He didn't believe me (and called me a pedophile) so I got a girl to explain it to him.

People of the US are also extremely prudish, it's as if the human body were ""the devil"". OH NO A BREAST ON TV AHHHHH!!! 

People of the US are xenophobic and nationalistic as hell.

Americans are stupid and I almost feel as I am Joe from the film Idiocracy sometimes.

Ive been called a traitor just for wanting to move to another nation.

Things like Glenn Beck and Fox News exist in America.

I would like to live in a place where I don't see people holding signs with dead fetuses on them (or at least not as much).

Is there anywhere in the world where I can talk to a stranger somewhere and they don't look at me as if they are saying ""Why the fuck are you talking to me"".

Even though I'm straight, I would like to live in a place with better gay rights.

I also want to live in a place with a lower crime rate and also less police brutality.


I have a personal story as well. I used to be very patriotic when I was younger, so much so that I joined the Navy. While I was there I was threatened for being different and just for not being a psychopath like them. I remember having people bang on my door in the middle of the night saying they wanted to kill me. Some even said they were going to rape me. I got out for pretending to be suicidal and I have a deep hatred for the US military. Ive tried explaining to people what they are really like but no one believes me. I hate being in a stadium and seeing military people being honored and cheered for (trust me they are a bunch of disgusting and evil red necks). Yes now I know every country cheers for there military but the big difference for me would be that if I were somewhere else, those people in that military never did anything personally wrong to me therefore I have nothing against them. Ultimately I would view renouncing my US citizenship as an act of revenge against the US military. 

Also I have mild aspergers syndrome and when I was diagnosed (shortly after getting out of the Navy) they told me I will always pretty much be a ""foreigner in my own land"". So if I'm always going to be different, wouldn't it make sense to just leave the country? At least if I was foreign I would be expected to be different.

Also my childhood here if full of bad memories. I remember cars driving by and throwing bricks and me and being screamed at. I remember people pretending to be my friend only so they can play some kind of sick joke. Even now Ive been harassed by older overweight conservatives just for having different beliefs. I had the realization a few years ago that almost everyone who has done anything bad to me has been an American.

I'm currently a junior in college and 23 years old. I plan to attempt my move after I graduate. My family is well off financially and willing to help me move.

Considering my incomplete list, what nation do you think would be good for me? Canada, Most West European Nations and Uruguay are the ones I'm considering now. I speak English and French (poorly) but could always learn something else.

Edit: More reasons, US doesn't use the metric system (this one really annoys me)

Only two political parties to choose from (and they are both crap).

Also yes everyone I know every place has it's faults and problems. Nowhere is perfect.

Also I know how to leave and things like that, I'm going to attempt to get an internship and do a study abroad program. Also in case you are wondering I have never lived anywhere else but I have visited many. I made this topic only to tell you some of my reasons for wanting to leave and asking other people their reasons.

1290173226.0,29,self.IWantOut,e8mtd,My experience obtaining Italian citizenship through jure sanguinis.,mindtehgap,31,2,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/e8mtd/my_experience_obtaining_italian_citizenship/,"I just discovered this subreddit, and posted a response to a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/dg5w0/dual_italian_citizenship_anyone_got_it_any/) that was several months old about Italian citizenship via jure sanguinis.  The OP of that thread asked me to post it in a new thread so more people would see it, so here it is.

My qualifications for Italian citizenship were:

* Great Grandfather, born in Italy in 1896.
* Grandmother, born in US in 1925.
* Mother, born in US in 1957.
* Me, born in US in 1977.

If you can trace your lineage unbroken back to your Italian ancestor, there are 2 main things that could disqualify you. First, understand that the Italian ancestor renounces Italian citizenship when he gets US citizenship. So only his children born before then have inherited his Italian citizenship. I was lucky, because my grandmother was the oldest of 5 children and was the only one born before my g-grandfather became a US citizen. A poster in the other thread said that they renounce their Italian citizenship when they apply for US citizenship, but this is not the case. Over a period of several years my g-grandfather applied, then had my grandmother, and then actually was granted US citizenship. His declaration of intent to become a US citizen says that he intends to renounce his Italian citizenship, but it is not actually done and official until US citizenship is granted. This makes sense, because otherwise a person would become stateless in the meantime, and possibly forever if US citizenship was denied.

The other possible problem is that women were not able to pass their Italian citizenship to their children until 1948. Again, this did not affect me because my mother ""inherited"" the right to citizenship from my grandmother due to being born in 1957.

The cost to gather the documents will depend on your specific situation. I paid nowhere near the $1000 cost mentioned by the OP of the previous thread. If you don't know your family's complete history and have to pay a researcher to dig it up, then of course that will increase the costs. The only costs I paid were for the official copies of documents, apostilles (more on that below), and then the final fee for my passport. How much this costs you will depend mainly on where your family documents are located, since every courthouse/government agency has different fees. I think the most expensive document for me was the apostilled copy of my marriage certificate from the US Virgin Islands, which was $25.

How long it takes for you to gather these documents will also depend on your situation. I live in Harrisburg PA, which is the state capital, so that made a lot of documents easy for me to get. And my great grandparents lived in a little town less than 100 miles away, so documents from there were not difficult either. Here is the list of what I had to track down, and where I got them from:

* Great grandfather's birth certificate: I wrote to the commune in Italy where he was born (Isca Sullo Ionio) and requested this. Surprisingly I received it in only a month or so. I used a form letter on the web that was already written in Italian to request this.
**EDIT**: here is the link to the form letter: [http://www.circolocalabrese.org/resources/letters/index.asp](http://www.circolocalabrese.org/resources/letters/index.asp)
* Great grandparent's marriage certificate: Northumberland Pennsylvania county courthouse. This was only an hour drive for me.
* Great grandfather's US citizenship/naturalization record: This was also in the Northumberland county courthouse, although from everything I have read, these are usually found through the former US Immigration and Naturalization Services which has now been absorbed into Homeland Security. I don't know if the location of these records has to do with when it was filed, or what.
* Birth certificates for me, my wife, my mother, and my grandmother, as well as death certificates for my great-grandfather and grandmother: All of these came from the PA Department of Health. Since I live in Harrisburg, I could just walk into the office and request them.
* Marriage certificate for my grandparents and parents: These were in the Dauphin county courthouse, also in Harrisburg.
* My marriage certificate: Via snail-mail from the USVI.

OK, once I had all these documents, I had to get apostilles for them. The best description I can give you for an apostille is that it is a certification from a head of state that guarantees to a foreign country that a document is authentic. Documents from Italy do not need an apostille. I requested that my marriage certificate from the USVI be sent with an apostille. And since all the other documents were from Pennsylvania, they were apostilled by the PA Department of State. Again, this was very easy for me since I live in the capital.

Now that I had everything needed, I had to present them at the Italian consulate for my location. For me, this is Philadelphia.  For some people, this presents a huge delay because I have read that some of them are backed up so much that appointments are not available for a year or two. For Philadelphia, they did not even take appointments - you just show up during their public opening hours and present the docs at a window. BTW, the hours that the Philadelphia consulate was open to the public: 9am until noon, Monday, Wednesday and Friday - The European work-ethic stereotypes hold true ;) Another hassle for some people is that the consulate they need to use is very far away. Philadelphia, for instance, has jurisdiction for as far south as North Carolina. Thankfully I can take the train to Philadelphia in less than 2 hours.  You are required to use the consulate that has jurisdiction for your location.  Even if you are willing to go to a different consulate that has a shorter wait time, you are not allowed. 

The man at the consulate went through all my paperwork, and once he decided it was all in order I filled out an AIRE - Anagrafe degli Italiani Residenti all'Estero. It's a registry of Italian citizens that are living abroad, and I chose to have it filed in the commune that my great-grandfather is from. I guess you could choose to have it filed anywhere in Italy, but I'm not sure. You are supposed to update this whenever you move, get married, divorced, have a child, etc.  A few months later I got a letter telling me that they have sent my documents to Italy, and I was now able to vote, etc.  About a year later I paid the fee and got an Italian passport, and successfully used it in the EU line at Heathrow immigration when I went to England.

Some random thoughts about the whole process:

* Drawbacks? None so far, although I almost certainly would not be able to get security clearance if I wanted to have a job with the federal government. I weighed the likelihood of that, versus the fact that the law could be changed in Italy at some point in the future and I would miss out (IIRC, this offer of citizenship was only made into law in 1992). I decided that it would be better to get it now. My sister had an internship with the NSA in college that required clearance, and they did ask a few questions about me. But she did get the clearance in the end, it just took a little longer.

* Most consulates require any documents not from Italy to be translated into Italian, and I believe some require you to use translators from their official list. This will certainly add time/expense to the process. When I applied, Philadelphia was not one of these consulates, although I have read that they do require this now. Which brings me to my next observation:

* The entire process for this seemed to be very inconsistent, depending on the consulate and even who is working when you submit your documents. As I said previously, not all consulates required translations. I have read that some consulates will want birth and death certificates of the non-Italian spouses, and others do not. Also, the man working at the consulate decided right then and there that my documents were acceptable for citizenship. They don't send them to Rome for an ""official"" decision or anything like that. I was just surprised that something like obtaining citizenship in a country could have so many inconsistencies and variations in the process. I would have expected it to be much more rigid and much less dependent on the whims of a particular office or staff member.

If anyone has any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.

I suddenly had the brilliant idea to find a nanny or an au pair position, and I spent an entire day filling out profiles on 3 different sites. On one particular site I received over 50 messages in 2.5 days of families expressing interests in my over qualification in the job- 25, female, psych major, activities coordinator certification, cpr/first aid certified, etc. One of the messages I received first was from a woman in Genoa, Italy. It sounded like a dream come true. In a week I had a one way flight booked, no visa, and little time to pack. I did a TON of research before I went and towards the end I had lots of hesitation- but I thought it was just nerves. This was my first time out of the country, you see. The biggest concern of mine was the pay- 70€ a week. I thought it would work out okay though, as I am used to living on little money.

I arrived in Genoa 3 days ago. I have been completely consumed with anxiety ever since. Because of the way things worked out with my trip over here, my 11 hour flight, my layover in Berlin, and now the anxiety I've experienced while here, I have gotten about 12 hours of sleep in the last week- if that. I will fall asleep for an hour or two late at night and wake up an hour or so after in a panic, unable to fall asleep for another 3 hours minimum. I also quickly realized that I am much too old for this job. After being on my own for 8 years and self sufficient, it is hard living under someone else's roof and rules. She is incredibly demanding and even the simplest things that don't effect her what so ever have to be controlled by her. I also feel I was not clear on my job duties until after I got here, when she emailed me a outlined list. I am expected to do 70 hours of work a week for 70€.

Today the anxiety, the exhaustion, and learning to deal with her came to a head, and I couldn't deal. We argued for awhile, had calm conversation for awhile, and then she decided it was best if I left. I have to be out by Sunday.

r/iwantout, I have no idea where to go or what to do with myself. I have little money. My dad purchased my flight over here, wanted me to stay the 90 days I had promised myself to stay which having no visa would allow me, and the flights out in the next week are hugely expensive. I feel like a huge disappointment to him and a bad investment in general.

Is there something I can do to earn a little money under the table while I wait out cheaper flights? I don't mind (and would prefer) relocating- probably to the UK as I only speak English and don't think I would be of much help anywhere.

Is there something different I can do to fix this situation I'm in (stranded in Europe, not the au pair gig) instead of tucking tail and (hopefully) heading home?

If you were me, what would you do?

**UPDATE:** I could not stay there any longer and left earlier today. I did not get paid for any of my time there, aside for a 20€ cab ride to the train station. Currently I'm in a hostel in Milan feeling at least 1000% better. I am happy and anxiety free for the first time in a week. I'm going to Germany on Friday where I'll be staying with a friend for awhile. I can wait out a cheaper flight, or house sit for 70€ for a few weeks. So far I'm leaning toward the latter.

Most of these posts don't seem to bring up the question of residency or citizenship through marriage. I know there are many resources using which we could figure out the exact guidelines, but the articles seem to be vast and intricately-worded.

Could anyone offer any help? I'd be very grateful for a layman's explanation, any suggestions, or good reading on the subject.

.... 
I mean uh... dip into my 401K.

**Background details**
 - Have $26,000 in a 401k with Fidelity investments.

 -Need money to pay rent(due Saturday), taxes(due Oct. 17) and my credit card balance(due a month from now)

 -I'm in Taiwan, where I'm trying to start a new life. No plans to return to the US anytime soon.

-Have been unemployed since Dec 2010 so there has been no income recorded for me for 2011

**Ideas I've found from googling**

-~~Should I roll the 401k into a traditional IRA, and withdraw from that~~?(answer turns out to be yes)

-~~Can I claim ""hardship"" since I'm trying not to be evicted from my apartment?~~(answer turns out to be no)


I figure about $4000 cash in my hand will pay my taxes(i filed for extension), my bills and let me live here long enough to get back on my feet.

**Update**: Being unemployed eliminates the ability to borrow from for my 401k. I can't borrow from it, but i can do withdrawals.

My plan now is to roll over into a traditional IRA, and then ""borrow"" money from that. The payback period is 60 days(the remainder is counted as a withdrawal) but I will be able to pay back some of the $4000, and it will be better than doing a withdrawal of the entire $4000. 

**Update 2**
I just setup an IRA which I am rolling over $5000 to. I will be able to withdraw from it next week to my bank account, and I'll have 60 days to pay as much of it back as I can. Everything else gets counted as a partial withdrawal. This solves all my problems while minimizing my tax liability and is my best option. 

The tax liability is also reduced because I will have extremely low income for 2011. Any income i earn will be Foreign earned income, so hopefully I will just take a 10% hit of whatever I can't pay back, shouldn't exceed $500, if that.


Thanks guys! And I know it's hard to believe based on this post, but this is actually the first time I've ever been in debt. I usually have my financial shit together.

So, long story short: I'm originally from France, immigrated to Canada in 2005, became a citizen in 2009 and I'm living in Ontario. I came to Canada on a working holiday visa in 2004 when I was 21. My permanent residence application was processed in a record four-month's time (yes, I'm proud of it!).

I'm pretty knowledgeable about immigration: once you go through the process everything is suddenly much clearer. But I remember how confusing it was to me when I first looked into it...

So, feel free to ask me anything about:

* the working holiday visa
* permanent residence in Canada
* life in Canada in general
* the citizenship process

**EDIT**: I'll reply to everyone little by little, no worries. Just give me a bit of time :-)

Meanwhile, just wanted to post a few useful links. Yes, some will be from my website because it avoids repeating always the same thing, it's just easier. Promise, it's not spam, it's relevant.

* [Citizenship and Immigration website](http://cic.gc.ca) is the official website of the ministry. You can find all the forms here, as well as plenty of info.
* [How to immigrate to Canada](http://correresmidestino.com/tag/how-to-immigrate-to-canada/) is a ten-post series I wrote a while ago summarizing all the main questions and basic info. I link to the index of the posts.
* [Immigration](http://correresmidestino.com/category/immigration/) is the tag I used for all the immigration-related posts on my website. 
* [The British Expats wiki](http://britishexpats.com/wiki/Category:Canada) has some good articles although there are a lot of blank pages. Still, relevant.
* [Settlement.org](http://www.settlement.org/index.asp) has good info for those coming to Ontario.

I feel like I'm slowly going crazy thanks to this meaningless rat-race where I have to choose between eating and paying the rent every month. It's like being on life support, I just make enough to keep myself alive so I can go to my job every day. Travelling, going out to bars or buying anything for myself is not an option.

It's not that 'useful' but I also have classical graphic artist skills(I'm a printmaker by trade) and sometimes I paint as well. I'd like to do some digital illustrations in the future but I'm not that experienced with this.

I'd like to go to a place where I can build my career without losing my mind, or where I can simply get by and study at a university at the same time. Since I'm a dirty post-communist eastern-european I don't really have high expectations for living standards. I have scotland, denmark and sweden in my mind but I'm not sure about the costs of living and the language expectations in the last two. How much do I need to save up before so I can pay for the rent/food in these countries untill I can get a job?

Quick back story, I am a 27 year old white male, speaking English with some poor basic Thai and Russian. I have worked as an EMT/Paramedic for the last 5 years, in an ambulance, as a hazardous construction medic, search and rescue, and in the emergency room. Before that I worked on cars, computers, did handyman work, taught CPR and Anatomy/Physiology as a medical docent, and popped residential and commercial (semi-legit) locks for a living. I've got to see and do alot of cool shit with my life, like stopping someone from bleeding out 600 feet underground and 400 feet underwater, riding on an ATV in the middle of the desert doing CPR on the back, and helping perform a post-mortem c-section. I am very thankful for all the opportunities, friends, and family I have had. Now, onto my predicament...

Recently my EMT/Paramedic license expired. I don't have any other licenses or certifications. I don't really have the cash or desire to re certify in this particular field. Most medics in this town (Las Vegas) make less than 14 an hour, and I am type 1 diabetic without health insurance. My living expenses are quickly rising with the lack of health insurance and I have no more sources of income besides the occasional job on craigslist doing any of the above mentioned. I really love working in my field, more than anything else, but politics and cash have made it exceptionally hard for me to keep going. I feel like my life is falling apart and I don't have the money to go back to school, so life has gotten pretty depressing. 

As soon as I heard myself say this, I wanted to smash my face into the concrete. I know that lots of people out there have it alot worse than I do. I have 2000 dollars left, and bought a one way ticket to Beijing for 550 dollars. I have already sold most of my possessions, and my affairs are in order. I have spent alot of time browsing this sub-Reddit as well as others, and I believe I have everything I need for getting around. I have made a list of things I have going for me and things I have going against me. 

**Going for me**:

1) I have acquired an amazing variety of skills that I have grown competent in over the years. I can do EMS, life guarding, fix cars, fix computers, fix most basic electronic devices, hang drywall, almost anything with construction including safety, plumbing, some carpentry, pick locks, teach archery and CPR, search and rescue, etc...however, with the expiration of my EMT/Paramedic certification, none of this is 'official'. Also, no college degree.

2) I have no strong needs for 'quality of life'. I don't mind sleeping outside, in the rain, camping in parks or outside of cities, bathing in sinks, sleeping in sleazy area's surrounded by less than desirable characters. I've stayed in areas so bad that I have been stabbed in the face, in the shoulder, and in the stomach. It hurt like hell, but its not something that I freak out about. Its life, right? Just another story. 

3) I am great with making new friends and telling stories. More than once here in town I have went to a dive bar alone and wound up crashing at a new friends house. 

4) I am fantastic with quick-thinking/working things out on the fly. I have a nose for getting both in and out of trouble, and has led me to many interesting times, both good and bad. However, I don't want to be starting shit in foreign countries, it seems rather disrepsectful on my part. 

**Going against me**:

1) I am leaving with 2000 dollars in my pocket, and not much else. Ticket has already been bought, leaving my house on July 13th and leaving the country on July 15th. No going back now.  

2) I have no solid plan, and I have no idea what I am doing or where I am going. As soon as I touch down in Beijing, I plan to visit Bangkok to visit an old girlfriend who offered a place to stay for a few days, and then just roam. I have no way back, and once the money runs out, I know I am probably screwed. 

3) I am diabetic. I have good control over it, I usually let it run a bit high to prevent myself from seizing either at work or overnight. Medication is cheap overseas, but I am more worried about food once the money runs out. 

4) I really have no strong sense of self-preservation left anymore. I have seen alot of death and alot of life in my time. I would be lying if thoughts of suicide (lots of EMS personnel wind up committing suicide at middle ages) haven't crossed my mind. But I believe this to be inherently stupid because I have no idea what the rest of the world is like, or what it has to offer. I figure the least I can do is see as much as possible before making any rash decisions. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing while travelling. Point is that I don't care what happens to me anymore.

5) People are telling me that this is 'running away'. I have no real response to it because on some level, they may be right. I am not as good at life as I thought I was, or I am just so tired of everything else here.


I am taking a small/medium military 35-liter pack that I can fit 2 pairs of pants, 4 shirts, 4 boxers, and 3 pairs of socks in, as well as a pretty small but spiffy med-kit for real emergencies (not first aid) (I will always be a medic first). I have a roll up hammock that compresses to a 2x2x2 square that I used to sleep in when I was homeless. Plus a towel, some rope, a fold-able 6x4 foot canvas sheet, a good knife, and a leathermen. There's enough room for about 2 days worth of food and water (stuffed it with Ramen and 3 quarts of water), plus a small pot that I use to boil water/food when I go camping. 

So, Reddit, I would like to know what else is out there. What should I be doing or seeing? Am I an idiot for wanting to get out so badly? Do you think I can find work, either illegitimate or legitimately? Most of all, do you think I can find a purpose out there, something to change my perspective? I don't want to see the touristy crap, I want to travel through rural areas, learn some culture and language, do and see things I haven't done before. 

Please, share any advice, comments, concerns, or criticisms. All input is welcome, and I thank you in advance.

What do you have to give up,jellyjamss,32,9,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/17qrmp/how_scary_was_it_for_you_to_start_your_new_life/,"i know this is probably not the best place to seek personal advice but i really have no one else to talk to about my problem.

To make a long story short, i met this girl from my old job and started dating her. We've been together two years but had to seperate after the 3rd year because her visa expired here in the u.s. she happens to be from thailand.

After she left, of course like anyone else would be i was really sad for awhile. But hanging out with friends and working alot of hours etc got my mind off of it, and we've been apart for about 2 years.

Fast forward to now, i've saved about 8k and planned on getting a student visa to study thai in bangkok. She's been waiting for me all this time, and its finally about to happen.

But now after finding out my plans my family is doing everything they possibly can to stop me from going through with this.

They've called thai/american embassies trying to flag both of our passports, and actually going out of their way trying to find anyone who can possibly stop me from entering thailand, and her from entering the u.s. ever again. And she even came into my house and stole my passport and birth certificate while i was at work.

While i do understand that this could be a bad decision, i do know the girl is not after me for my money considering her family has more than mine ever could.
My family thinks shes just using me to get an american visa and to steal my money ( which i dont have any ) But would that really be such a bad thing to marry a girl to help give her a visa?

I usually have a hard time trusting people, but I'm a good judge of character and know this girl doesn't want anything from me except for... me.
I'm so confused and dont know what to do, im 26 years old and right now I'm torn between a girl and a new life.... or a family that loves me but is over controlling and way to protective and manipulative.

I'll start!,ggqq,32,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/15fsa7/memorable_experiences_during_your_travels_ill/,"I was wondering if any of you have collected any memorable experiences through your travels? I had one just earlier this month.

I was in Japan for two weeks from early December and I have to say that I LOVED it. The sights, the smells, the taste - everything about the place was magical.

I just wanted to share what was actually my first (and incidentally, most memorable) experience in Japan. I hope you're keen for a long read.

My plane had just touched down in Tokyo from frosty Beijing. The temperature didn't really shock me, but I was still adjusting, still mystified in awe of my surroundings. The first part that hits me of every new country I visit is the language. Signs, maps, general chatter - Before this, the only Japanese I'd known was from watching far too many anime series.

As I wheeled my luggage to the platform, still contemplating whether or not I had purchased the correct ticket for the metro, I spotted a  girl in her late teens. Leg warmers, ballerinas, freckles; you get the picture. She was extremely cute. Plugged in and tapping away at her phone, I took the empty seat next to her, thinking she wouldn't notice.

However, because I often forget that I'm actually ethnically Chinese and that all Asians (as much as we like to deny it) actually look exactly the same, she immediately took out her earphones and talked to me in Japanese. All I could make out was the first few syllables before I flipped out. ""toire..."" (I know that means toilet, because I took Japanese for a term when I was at elementary school, and the teacher would always make us ask in Japanese when we needed to go and refuse if the students got it wrong. It's a rather cruel practice, now that I think about it)
Anyway, as I said, I flipped. I lost my fucking cool. I mean before I got there, I had read up a lot on Japanese culture, their customs, what's offensive, what isn't.. etc. so I immediately go into apologetic foreigner mode, which went along the lines of *Apology-explanation-follow up apology* using some of the few words of actual Japanese that I know.

She stumbles ""Ah! Uhh.. I want.. to go..... uh..""

""To the toilet?"" I proclaim.

""Hai! Can you..."" *Gestures towards her luggage*

""Sure, I'll watch your bags while you go to the bathroom"". 

I smile at her. A smile means the same things the world over.

As she gets back, the train approaches. She thanks me for watching her bags and prepares to board. I ask if it goes to my stop (because Tokyo's metro system is unnecessarily complex) and she tells me it does. Awesome. So I hop on the train with her. She takes a seat on a different side to me and starts tapping away at her cellphone, so I can do nothing but sit there and follow the stations and cross reference them to the map I have. There seemed to be a lot of stops that weren't on the map however, and I became increasingly anxious as to when I would be reaching mine.

Eventually, her stop came up. She got up and got ready to get off. She fidgeted with a folded leaf of notepaper in her hands.

No.

Fucking.

Way.

She walked over to me and handed me the note. In it, she described the directions to my station, noting where I should change stations, what time the trains arrived, which platforms they were on; everything. And all in both English and Japanese too. She had been on her phone researching and translating the directions for me.
And at the very bottom, she had written - *Welcome to Japan. Have a nice day!*

She nodded at me as she disembarked, but all I could say was ""Thank you"". It was literally the cutest thing that I had ever seen. You have to understand though - coming from China, where people often wouldn't even move out of the way for each other in the street, this was fucking heart-wrenching - to see that there were actually people that were this nice. I felt like a jerk just being amongst those people. It gave me a really good first impression of Japanese people as a whole.

Do any of you know of specific examples?  The reporting in the U.S. would have you believe that there is no place around that'll accept deposits from Americans.  That would seem to create a high barrier for expats as they would have to move their money out of U.S. banks and convert it to the local currency on a frequent basis due to the inability to maintain a local bank account.

A friend recommended this subreddit and I thought I should give it a try. I really could use some good advice. Bad advice is welcome too but the good kind might be more useful. My story might be long so bear with me.

I've wanted to live in the US for as long as I can really remember. After graduating from Oxford University with a law degree I went to California to get my master's degree. After that I sat (and passed) the NY bar exam. I now have a license to practice law there. I then worked for a company out in LA who was going to transfer me to NY when it came to the time to get a new visa. However, my boss is an idiot and he got my application for a work visa in too late. Now he wants me to apply for a j-1 which I'm not really eligible for because I don't have work experience in the UK. I had to self-deport a few days ago and now I'm back in the UK. I had a great life in the US: great friends, a beautiful apartment, and a job that was helping me pay off my debts. Now I'm back and probably soon to be unemployed and living with my mum. I lost all my independence and I'm incredibly heartbroken. I haven't lived here in the past 2 years and I'm completely unsure about where to start. My qualifications, experience, and contacts are in the USA and I'm unsure about how to get back.

Can anyone give me any advice or help?

-I'm 21 living in California.  

-I'm a professional body piercer (no I don't work in some sketchy garage. I work at a shop with a very good reputation.) and I have been for over 1 year. I started my apprenticeship when I was 18.

-As far as school I don't really have much. I have some basic EMT training but not enough to become a actual EMT.

-I am attempting to learn French to help my chances of immigrating.



Some info about my girlfriend

-20 years old and has lived in California her whole life like me.

-Education is no more than mine

-Works in a Deli

-She does have family in Canada but she knows nothing of them and I'm fairly sure they don't know she exists. So I don't believe it would do us much good but I could be wrong. They are also in Ontario I believe.



We have both traveled to British Columbia and we loved it there so much, we want to leave the states and live there. I've been thinking about searching for piercers in BC to see if I can land a job there but I don't know how Canada sees piercers. In California I fall under the category of ""unregulated activity."" I know landing a job before I get there would help me financially but I don't know if it'll help me immigrate. Regardless I want out but I'm really not sure where to go from here.


I would prefer not to study there. I don't even know if I have the option considering how my grades were in highschool. I also fear student loan debt and that is just not an option for me.

Most lists I've seen make Vancouver, Sidney etc. the best cities to live in, but I think that's mostly biased towards English-speaking people, with American mentality. For example, my preference would be a nice sunny weather, good healthcare, good nightlife and a 1st world economy. Money is not the top priority so I don't care how much i earn as long as it's enough for basic needs and nightlife. I don't have a need to buy iPads and similar stuff. I also wouldn't want to work as much as Americans do, so that disqualifies most US cities, and I'm guessing Canadians also work a lot, so Vancouver is off the list too. I would need at least 4 weeks of vacation, which is the standard in most of Europe. Berlin would be a good city because it has everything I need, but the weather is maybe not so good... but it's not too bad either. I'm also not sure if I could get a job there without speaking German first. Because of this, some city in the Netherlands would be a good pick, because they usually don't demand that you speak Dutch before you move there. Learning the language afterwards is fine, even better if there are some free courses for immigrants. However, their weather sucks a bit more, and I'm not too sure if I'd like the Dutch ""direct"" mentality.

I know absolutely nothing about cities in East Asia, is there anything comparable to what I just wrote above? I've met some people from Hong Kong and they seemed really cool, but I'm not sure how easy it is to get a work visa there.

Both countries are greatly appealing to me, but I have read about some occasional difficulties people have had immigrating from the US to Canada (which strikes me a bit odd).

I just read a few accounts of fairly easy migration to New Zealand, however.  Of course, the accounts weren't that specific in how long/arduous it was to attain residence in the long haul... but it seemed that at least getting your foot in the door was relatively easy for these people.

This said... I'm a university student in the IT field, so I probably won't have problems either way.  I could either study more, or apply as a skilled worker, right?  But if one nation is somewhat easier than the other to acquire ultimate citizenship, maybe that's all the difference it will take to decide upon which (though I do love the crap out of BC and Nova Scotia)

So here goes; I'm a 20 years old finnish guy who wants out. I have no futher education than high school. I've worked in retail (hardware store), construction sites, done some basic gardening jobs etc. 
I've been thinking about packing my backpack and trying the expat life in Cambodia. And oh yes, I got this far without saying I want to teach english or do some NGO stuff. 
I speak fluent english and I fucking love chatting with strangers and I am very extrovert so I have no problems building a social network in a new country but I do have a bad habit of being very impulsive.

I spent a month in the country last fall and absolutely fell in love with the capital Phnom Penh. I made friends with some expats and the expat community seemed very honest and awesome to me.
Every expat who I spoke with told me that expat life in the capital in very glamorous if you like the ""wild east"" atmosphere and a weird lifestyle. 
I only know the absolute basics of khmer but I'm willing to learn the language and I know that the country opens up a lot better if you know the language.
My friend has an appartment in the city with AC and internet and it's like 150 dollars a month.
I'm very aware that because I only spent a month in Cambodia I was stuck in the legendary ""honeymoon phase"" so I only saw the good things about the country and ignored the bad things. But I still want to go.

But as my very nordic self tells me to get straight to the point so I will: 

How easy is it actually getting an english teaching job there?
I was offered some jobs and people told that you don't need a certificate or to be a native english speaker, just speak the language fluently.
I plan on starting with a tourist visa and see how it goes. I don't mean to permanently move to the country just live the expat life as long as I want to and after that just travel around Asia.

Another question is that how well can you live by an english teaching job in there?
I don't have a hedonistic lifestyle and last year as a backpacker I spent like 600 dollars in a month (including trasportation, accommodation, touristy stuff, nightclubs etc.) and I heard you can get maxium of 1000 dollars a month from a teaching job?",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,False,,,True,t3_1ierwc,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1ierwc/finland_to_cambodia/,

I have two felonies: a) Trafficking in a controlled substance and b) Trafficking while in possession of a firearm (rifles in the trunk/boot). I was arrested in 2004 but not convicted until 2006, so the convictions are 7 years old. I was sentenced to 30 months in prison.

I don't offer excuses, as there are none, but I would like to offer a back-story. I grew up in a physically, emotionally and verbally abusive home which I was kicked out of as a 16 year old. It wasn't an option to drop out of school, so I slept in my car and on friend's couches while I completed my high school education.
I started dating a girl whose father turned out to be an area drug dealer. Seeing the money he was making, looking at my own circumstances, and not necessarily being of sound mind or judgement at the time, I decided that if I was to get ahead, this was the way to do it. It wasn't. I was arrested and sentenced to prison, which was the best thing that could have happened to me.

Since my release, I have completed a BSc in Business Management, graduating Summa Cum Laude, equivalent to a UK ""First"". I have been consistently employed full-time, and recently gone back to school to become a .NET/SQL Server programmer.

I'm currently in the US, thinking of moving to the UK. My wife is English, so I would try to come in on a spousal visa, if I can pass the character requirement. The convictions will be considered ""spent"" under UK law in 2016, ten years from the conviction.

Questions: Is there any chance I would ever be able to get a programming position in the UK? Would I have a better chance waiting until after 2016, when the convictions are spent? (I assume the employer would still find out about them through a background check.)

TL;DR:

Two felonies from 2006: Trafficking in a controlled substance and Possession of a firearm while trafficking. BSc Management (Honours: First). Training in .NET/SQL server. I've been consistently employed for years in a professional capacity, in a position of trust, and I have great references. Convictions will be spent in 2016.

It occurred to me that I'm young and may not have the opportunity for this later on, plus, it could give me some interesting work experience.

Brazil has been somewhere I've always wanted to go. Rio de Janeiro would be my first choice of location, but after that, I'm not too concerned as long as it's a major city on the coast. 

I have a bachelor of arts in economics and I minored in finance. Ideally, I'd like to get a position at a venture capital firm, but anything remotely related to economics and/or finance would be great for me.

Did I mention that I don't speak a lick of Portuguese? I can understand a small amount when I read, but that's about it. I am willing to learn the language though.


Any suggestions?

**EDIT:** Thank you for the responses. 

Do Brazilians have a general perception of Americans? 

As mentioned, I studied econ/finance, but I didn't go to an amazing school. How are American universities perceived down there?

**EDIT 2:** Thanks again for the responses guys! You have all been very helpful. I will contact some people on LinkedIn at VC/PE firms down there and see if I have a chance in hell. Otherwise, I'm not opposed to teaching English as this is probably the best time in my life to make a move. 

Not sure if it makes a difference, but I'm 25 years old. No obligations. No kids. No girlfriend, but maybe that could change in Brazil :-) . My work experience is some nonprofit work (leadership role) and a long internship that I just finished up where I did M&amp;A advisory at a small PE firm.

**EDIT 3:** As far as cities go, how are Salvador, Recife, and Fortaleza?

My biggest concern concerns jobs. All the time I hear how hard
it is to get a job and how underpayed young college graduates are. Is this true everywhere? My father tells me its true for unskilled workers and that people like me have it waaay easier in the states, on the other hand he is an unskilled worker and thus gets the perception of one.

Now if we talk about mobility around the U.S., I have no trouble with it, my father resides on Dallas but he constantly moves all around the states working, so I am open to settle anywhere. My plan is to permanently reside on the U.S.

One of my friends, a PhD student at McGill, was telling me recently how a lot of his friends had been moving to Mexico City to do their dissertations, and generally would not come back. 

If any of you are American artists or intellectuals you probably can relate to how impossible it is to survive in the U.S; every city is too expensive, you spend more time working shit jobs than being creative, etc. I have heard that Mexico City is inexpensive, pretty, has good public transit and cheap rents. I grew up in Arizona about 100 miles from the border so it's a familiar country to me. The plan would be that I would get by through freelance writing gigs, only I could get by working a lot less in Mexico than I would in the US (hopefully). My Spanish is also decent.

short version: I am a poor artist, I want to live as cheaply as possible and work somewhere pretty and boho and cheap and Mexico City sounds awesome.

I was wondering about these things, though:

* how easy is it to move there/get a visa as an American with a masters degree?
* how cheap can you get a room there? Is $100USD/month unrealistic?
* is there a large expat community? A large or open intellectual/writer/artist community?
* what neighborhoods might be best for someone trying to do what I'm trying to do? 
* what resources would be good for finding housing? I've found a lot of online stuff but from what I've found if it's advertised online it's already too expensive for me.
* should I be considering somewhere like Buenos Aires instead? It seems like it might be much more expensive in comparison.

I thought I made the right choice.  My health care was fantastic and virtually free, my entire masters degree cost less than one course at a private US college, the people were intellectual for the most part, and the economy was great (and still is).

I love it here! The language, the people, the weather, the natural beauty... it's a wonderful place where I would seriously consider settling down. The one drawback concerns gay life here. It's not so much that the society is overtly or strongly homophobic, but the culture isn't really conducive to the development of gay relationships, particularly relationships in which one of the parties is a foreigner. 

First, I don't think the problem is necessarily a lack of venues or resources to connect gay men but rather a different framework in which people approach their sexual orientation/identity. Every guy that I've had to opportunity to go on a date with (4 or 5) has been closeted. Taiwan is also a very family-oriented culture (as in, parents often live with the oldest male and children often don't move out on their own until they're married). Of those men I met that were interested in a relationship, any discussion of how I might eventually fit into their family life was met with a, ""You think too much."" Furthermore, as a foreigner in a fairly ethnically homogeneous society, I am often approached for the novelty factor, and I'm therefore suspicious of whether or not men are genuinely interested in knowing who I am as a person. 

I'm writing this post to solicit advice and anecdotes from other LGBTQ redditors (and advocates!). Where have you had the most positive relationship experiences as an LGBTQ immigrant (or traveler) from the West? Has anyone had the experience of finding someone from their native culture who was willing to emigrate with them? Have you managed to make a relationship work in an oppressive situation? 

I'd like to point out that I'm not overly concerned with legal issues (being able to be legally married, etc.), but rather with attitudes/norms within the gay community (e.g. how open gay men are to exclusive, long-term relationships, the extent to which they tend to be ""out"" in social circles, how they navigate family life, etc.). I'm not particularly interested in Western countries, but anecdotes from anywhere are welcome. I really love this part of the world, but the prospect of being single for the rest of my life isn't very appealing. As someone who has been out since early adolescence, these are issues that I haven't ever thought about confronting. I'm sure things will end in a compromise, but I'm not sure what I'm willing to give up or what's reasonable to expect... Thanks in advance.

I currently live in The Bahamas and I have 10+ years of experience working in the IT field at a corporate level as well as computer shop work. I only have basic certifications but I feel my years of experience should outweigh that. Still I am currently working on getting higher level certifications so that my paperwork easily matches with my real world knowledge.

I would like to get out and I have been exploring the options of European countries, South America, Australia and Canada. So far it's been rough to say the least. For one thing most places seem to only be concerned with candidates that have a bachelor's degree. This shortcoming may be my greatest hurdle to overcome but also the fact that I am so far away from these places and from a such little blip on the map. I really don't know how to turn this around.

I have applied to a few job openings posted online in various places through the use of indeed.com and CareerBuilder (mainly in the U.S.). I have also applied for many of the job openings in the mining industry in Australia. They have IT jobs available as well as other positions that I personally would not have a problem doing however I have been turned down for some of these and for others I have not received a response. I have done the Canadian foreign worker assessment on which I scored a 67 which is a passing grade and I have spoken to a Canadian consultant but it seems my only real option there is to visit Canada and search for a job while in the country before my stay is up. Even then it would take 6+ months before I got the ok to begin work.

I don't feel it is a must that I do something IT related but it seems to be the best chance that I have at this point and still so far my attempts have failed. If anyone can offer my some tips or advice I would greatly appreciate it.

**Note:** I currently provide internet marketing services for a few clients which allows me to work from anywhere but right now it's really not much. I have been trying to get more clients but it is extremely difficult to do from my current location. This is due to the fact that most serious clients prefer to meet with you in person or through someone they know. Freelance websites are over-saturated so I have not been very successful with those. If I could get more clients it would be much easier to visit various places to look for work and residency. This would also be a way of showing customs workers that I can sustain myself while in the country.

I just came back from Uruguay (Am in Argentina now) where I was doing research as well as visiting friends and absolutely enjoyed Montevideo.  Having lived in Colombia, Argentina, and Peru before, it was a nice change of pace. I truly do feel my best when I am here and often times even thinking about not having an opportunity to stay and then being forced to go back to the US just breaks me down.

While I do admit the cost of living was ridiculously high and not adjusted for local salaries (inflation is a crippling problem), I was amazed by the city, the people, the friendliness, and the overall atmosphere.

I have recently graduated from university with a BA in Modern Language and Linguistics and another in Political Science (Comparative Analysis with a focus on Latin America and Control of Corruption/Human Rights). Fluent in English, Spanish, and have an intermediate level of French. While I was accepted to grad school at the University of Alberta in Canada to do the MA in Latin American Studies, I am taking a gap-year in order to teach English in Spain under a grant.  

But I really, really want to go back to Uruguay to do my MA at the University of the Republic.  They have a program in the Faculty of Social Science that surpasses the program at UA.  Given that my goal is to work in Latin America and transplant myself down here for good, would it be reasonable to do so?

Is there anyone here who has successfully moved to and stayed in Uruguay? 

Is there anyone here who has studied at the Universidad de la Republica? (Uruguayan or foreigner)? It is a free institution for everyone so the issue of tuition payments would be counter-balanced by actual living expenses (rent, transportation, food, etc). How are foreigners received? 

How bad is the residency process? I have been reading and poking around and there is a lot of missing information as well as some fairly mixed opinions. Many say an immigration lawyer is the best route to take but others say it's manageable if you take care of all your paperwork beforehand (which goes without saying in most cases, methinks...)

Uruguay does have a high rate of unemployment, but does being an English speaker in a country where English is now just starting to gain a foothold in the education system possibly give me an advantage? 

Reading this forum gives me hope but I am trying to be realistic as well.

- Male, 25

- French nationality, living in France

- degree in English 

- experience : mainly worked crappy low paid jobs

- taught English privately (kids) but nothing steady 

- speak : French, English, Spanish, (Portuguese 50%, going to Brazil soon anyways)

- no criminal record

I mainly want out of France b/c I've lived most of my life in a high crime area and by high I mean HUGE.

People rarely mug you for your money here, they just want to beat you, burn you, humiliate you...for fun...
Cops are useless.

Second reason is the lack of employment :

I graduated in 2008, right when the economy crisis hit us hard, haven't been able to find a job since. Except Mcdonald's...

Tried to study something else, but there's a strong ""racial profiling"" problem, can't change my skin color so :/

I lived in other cities in France, but came back here b/c the unemployment was WORSE or housing was way too high.

Unemployment and crime in France have been crazy for the last 5 years, but the media and the gov try to hide these facts.

I'd like to start over, be given a chance to prove myself, to find a real job, I'm aware my lack of work experience is a huge handicap, but there's almost no industry left here, I'm not being lazy or whatnot I moved to other cities for temp work, but that's all left :/

    First of all, is it as great as it sounds, or is it pointless? One thing that every resource says is that you need to already have a job lined up in the EU. If by this they mean ""you need a company to sponsor you,"" wouldn't that mean the minute you quit that job your card is no longer valid, AKA the same as a regular work visa? Or does it just mean that you need to have a job and you apply for the card completely independent of the company?
    Second, the blue card information reads as if every country has it and offers it (except a few like Ireland and Denmark), but why the big fuss about Germany implementing it recently? Is it just a ""concept"" to most countries and only a couple (like Germany) are actually giving them out? If a country doesn't offer blue cards, will they still accept them?

I'm going no where, no friends, living with my parents, at a piece of crap college.. I can't even drive I just want to start over.  I have no real career because like I said my community college is a joke and I just feel like I'm so far behind in life and have wasted so much time supporting my family.  My family is basically non supportive to me back, it's a long story so I'll spare you details. My parents *are* supportive but really only so much they can do and are still fairly close minded themselves. 

When I discuss about how **I** want to move I just feel like they are very negative towards the idea just because *they* can't just pick up and move (due to fear/laziness themselves). I've spent like 3 years helping them find jobs in locations where **I** wanted to go also and they just never follow up! I figured since I can't go alone how about they come with me.. or often times they get the mood to ""want to move"" too. I have done their resumes and countless nights looking for jobs... they never transfer licenses.  I've gotten people to call for job followups.. they sometimes ""aren't in the mood"" to answer the phones.. I give up. This has been going on since 2006. I'm at the point where I'll just sell or trade in my other crap like my gaming systems, books and whatever else.. I just don't even enjoy them anymore, I don't enjoy anything anymore really. I don't have a real extended family support like most either. It just seems like i'm stuck supporting them for the rest of my life. 


Anyone CURRENTLY under 25 ever moved away anywhere without a real life? I know most of you have degrees or experience in something but I don't. I simply want to move across the country (USA) but it just seems like I have no way at all of doing so. I'll take food stamps or whatever, I don't care as long as I'm gone from here, I don't have money or real education anyway. I wouldn't mind going to a francophone country either as I am studying it on my own but like I said I can't even make it in the US it seems. I've tried to get a job but even McDonalds isn't hiring where I am. I have to wait 6 months to apply again. I live in a small town that does not offer much whatsoever plus i don't have a license so yea. I've posted a shorter version on reddit before and all I got was ""LOL youre 25 and haven't figured out how life works by now i dunno what else to say"" I hope this subreddit can either help if not I'm willing to read your stories as motivation.

I will be graduating soon, and will work for a year, before (hopefully) entering an MA program in Germany in 2012. 

Some background: one of my undergrad majors is German so I have at least a basic working knowledge of German. My other undergrad degree is also in the humanities. 

My question is this: how can I make money to support myself in Germany while I am in graduate school? I have heard getting jobs there is difficult. However, grad school will cost a lot less than it will here. I am considering getting a CELTA certification for teaching English -- how difficult do you think it would be to get a job teaching English in Germany? 

My second question is, how difficult do you think it would be for me to live/work in Germany after I finish graduate school? (I haven't decided what MA program I will pursue, but it will likely be in the either in the Humanities or Social Sciences, or a business program). Do you have any recommendations of what fields might lead to a decent career in Germany for a non-native? Or, would you know of any websites that give info about jobs in Germany, and how difficult it is to find jobs in different fields?

I went to the local Portuguese consulate recently to apply for my dual citizenship.  My father was born there and we have all of his documentation, so there's no real 'loophole' I'm exploiting and there's no contention about me being legally capable of obtaining the citizenship.  However, I had to look around for the Candid Camera crew after the following exchange:

Consulate Person (CP):  ""What is your marital status?  Single, married...""

Me:  ""Sing...""

CP: ""Divorced?""

Me:  ""Yeah, well, I'm single because I'm divorced.""

CP: ""Oh okay, what's your ex-wife's name?""

Me:  ""Herpie Le Derp.""

CP (Without missing a beat and thinking what she's asking for is completely reasonable):  ""Okay, you need to contact her and get her original birth certificate which we will keep here.  You also need to get a lawyer both here and in Portugal.  The lawyer here must take the marriage certificate and divorce documents and translate them into Portuguese.  They must be then certified by the consulate and sent to your lawyer that you've hired in Portugal who has power of attorney to act on your behalf to register the marriage.""

Me (in utter disbelief, picking my jaw up off the floor):  ""No, no.  Really, what do you need?""

CP:  ""I'm not joking.  You have to go to the county courthouse and they can give you a copy of the marriage license if you don't have it. (I do)""

Me:  ""That's okay, I'd hate to have to go to ELOPEMENT LOCATION 3,000 MILES AWAY.  That'd be silly.  But isn't the rest of this kind of excessive?  You guys expect me to contact someone I divorced and ask them for an original document like a birth certificate?  There's a reason we got divorced.""

CP:  ""OH, you got married in 3,000 MILES AWAY?  Well, in that case, you have to contact the consulate there.  They have to translate the marriage license and certify it there for you.  Then they'll send it here and have us certify it.  Then you can go to your lawyer and continue with the steps from before.""

Me (still frantically looking around for a camera crew):  ""My God.  Okay, what's next?""

CP (typing and printing a document):  ""Here's your temporary birth certificate.  We'll send you a permanent one in the mail and then you can come back in and get your ID card and Passport.  In the meantime, try to get that marriage issue sorted out.""

Me:  ""So can I still get the ID card and Passport if the marriage isn't yet 'registered' so to speak?""

CP:  ""Yes.""

Take a wild guess if I'm going to do ANY of the marriage registration malarkey she outlined for me.  (Unless someone here can tell me I can get in deep, deep piles of shit by not).

So in case you're thinking of doing the same, just be ready for trolling and close minded attitudes (although there were also good answers).

   

Anyways, I've searched this subreddit for simillar situations but didn't find many so I decided to just post anyway.

   

*I turned 19 this year (and I'd bring my boyfriend along who is also turning 19 this year)
    

*We both finished high school (I finished with an average of 15 out of 20 and took classes like geography, philosophy, psychology, english, sociology) and we both finished a IELTS academic test with high scores
   

*I don't have any real job skills. I'm still not sure what to do but I would like to do modeling, photo editing (since I was about fourteen I started learning about positioning for photographs and taking pictures and editing them and i'm pretty good at it and could get better) or makeup (i've also always loved makeup and i'd like to do special effects i'm still trying to decide between going to university, a makeup academy or both).
I also have some interest in interior design, astronomy and something computer related (not as complicated as programming though, I don't think i'd have the ambition for that). I also have blue hair so right off the bat it makes it harder for me to get a normal average job (at least here in portugal). My boyfriend however is a normal looking guy and he's thinking of psychology, anthropology or journalism (right now he's working in a hotel so he's getting some decent work experience).


*My language skills include portuguese and english (i've been in contact with the english language since i was a kid), a little bit of spanish and i can understand slow spoken french.


*No criminal record for either


*I have a canadian dual citizenship



I've been considering going to London for a long time because i love it (been there 3 times and visited a uni there last year) but I'm also considering other countries that might be less expensive to live in.
So far, besides London, I'm considering germany (there's a program that pays for 3 years of some specific courses and has an almost guaranteed job), Canada (maybe Montreal, because it seems like a good country to live in from the light research i did, I have the advantage of dual citizenship and my boyfriend has some relatives near Vancouver) or maybe some nordic country like sweden. Also my dad is currently living in Miami (he lived in canada for a long time that's how i got the dual citizenship) but I'm always hearing how visa's are a bitch to get and in comparison to canada it seems like a worse choice.

I'm now finishing my gap year and i'll either move abroad around september or stay here one more year depending on how it flows.

Oh and economically speaking it's tough. It's feasible but I figure I'd have to have a pretty tight budget.

So does any of you here have any personal experience they could share? Maybe a fellow portuguese with an emmigration story or just someone who knows someone who did something simillar.

**About Me:**

 I'm a 21 year old Cuban male, born and living in the US. Long story short, I lived a middle class life, step-father left my mother at 16, I left my senior year of high school to work in my father's business, saved some money, my dad died without a will, I spent money on lawyers to contest his assets, his wife took everything, leaving me with said lawyer bills. I have $12,000 to my name and I want out and to get in control of my life.

**Pros**

I want to move to Spain. I have a good command of the English language, my Spanish is neglected, but 4 months of real effort and it will be up to scratch. I have an excellent work ethic. Never been arrested, much less stopped by the police. 

**Cons**

I have no college degree, slap that onto the fact that I left high school to work and earned a frakking GED. This is where I feel things might simply not be possible.  

**Goals**

Ideally I could have a job teaching English, or something that will allow me to live frugally. My main goal would be to study. Now this might seem like a stretch, but I could take out a loan for that. My credit is clean. The main problem is finding a university that would take me. Even one that can be used as a stepping stone. Point is, I'm looking for a second chance. I've made some shitty decisions in my life and I'm sure some of you guys can commiserate.

Long story short, I'm an American PhD student who will be in the US for the next five years completing my specialization in environmental risk analysis of oil, gas and geothermal well-site operations. I am (obviously) fluent in English and nearly fluent in French (written and oral) but I'd have to brush up on my technical language.

My SO is a civil engineer and PhD student who is completing his specialty in urban planning from the perspective of water resource management.

We're both committed to becoming career academics and are highly dissatisfied with the recent political attack on the National Science Foundation (NSF) along with the general decline in quality of life here due to a myriad of factors of which I'm sure many of you are aware.
We're also concerned that there really isn't significant political will here for either of us to be effective instituting the kind of changes we wish to see regarding long-term planning on a regional or national scale. Also, I don't want to get into politics too much, but we generally don't agree with the wars, bank bail outs, etc.  

So, if I can't move anywhere for five years, why be concerned now? Well, I understand that moving and acquiring a visa or citizenship can be a long process and, through our studies, each of us will have the opportunity to spend a semester (or longer) in a different country to conduct our respective research. Therefore, we'd like to compile a list of countries where a) our skills would be more useful and appreciated and b) we could raise 1 to 2 children in a safe area with rich educational opportunities. 

Admittedly, I'm not a very worldly person -- I've only been outside the country to do work for Engineers Without Borders in Honduras -- so I'm not sure where to start. All I know is I need to get out of here. Germany seems reasonable because they're investing heavily in energy infrastructure and have the right government policies in place in order to encourage the adoption of alternative energy technology. 

Oh, we don't mind leaving the continent as neither of us is particularly close to family and we've been living in Miami for 7 years so we already know what it's like living someplace where English isn't the default language.

Any thoughts from other scientists or folks who have left the US for similar reasons? Did you regret leaving? What didn't you consider that you wish you had? Are we being stupid for leaving our home country for these reasons? 

Where should we head to?

It's been my dream for a long time to work 100% remotely while traveling. Or, you know, to travel without having to work, but I am in my late 20s and do not have enough money to retire yet ;) 

I've been working my current job for about a year. I started out working onsite at the company I work for in the midwest, then I got permission to work remote half time, and now I got permission to work remote 100%. I will still come back a few times a year, because I think it will be good for me, and I will visit friends and family. I do great work, and I am lucky enough to have a kickass manager, whose trust I have earned. I'm able to do all my work (network engineering) without being onsite.

I'm moving out west (USA) to work remotely and also work on a business I started with my business partner. Toward the end of this year I will head south of the border, and become a nomad, still working full-time, making my way from Mexico through the Caribbean and Central and South America. I speak fluent Spanish, and I am lucky enough to have been to Mexico several times and to have friends there, and in other Latin American countries. I have spent a grand total of 6 months in Mexico, and I've been to every country in Central America at least once, and I've been to Colombia a few times. I'm sure I'll travel Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia as well, but I know I could easily spend a decade in Latin America.

I don't foresee losing my job anytime soon, but if I do, I'll just get another 100% remote job - they are fairly easy to come by in my field, especially with my connections.

I guess I don't have much else to say. I just thought I'd let you all know how I have been working on being able to work remotely and get out for a long while, and it's finally paying off. Feel free to ask any questions.

I’m not married to this idea though and it’s more important that I go at all than that everything be perfect.


To answer the questions in the help doc first:


Age: 31
Education: Bachelor’s in English / French, Assoc. in Communications, Certificate in Internet Programming (from 2001, hehe)

Job skills: I’m a film editor so I’m proficient in Final Cut Pro &amp; Avid, I’ve worked for several years as a cook, I taught English in a French school for a year, plus various experience tutoring, translating, and editing texts peppered throughout.

Language skills: Fluent in Spanish &amp; French, high intermediate Portuguese, basic / intermediate in: Russian, Italian, German.

Convictions: not yet

Alternative destinations: I’d like to stay in SA but I’m open to different locations within
Temporary or permanent: both though I’d like to wind up in something semi-permanent

Nationality / location: American, live in NYC.



So why am I asking for help?  My window for making this decision is short and I’m having trouble sorting through all the information.  I feel like I might be trying to do two things at once and I want to find a compromise.  My inspiration was the idea of spending some time without a set destination and living with almost nothing, but on the other hand if I eventually want to settle I have to think about bringing more stuff, like my laptop, and finding remote / local work that utilizes my higher-paying skills.  To state that more succinctly: I want to vagabond and then ideally work as little as possible so I have time to focus on writing &amp; art.  I’m willing to compromise on all of this but I don’t want to be without a net.



Some specific questions:


How much money do you really need to “go with nothing?”  I’ll be leaving with a few thousand bucks tops.  My bills are around $100/month now but may go up a bit from student loans.  I want to avoid sticking around in the states to save up more because moving would put me in more debt than traveling would.


A lot of places want to see an exit ticket to give you a visa.  How do you resolve this while keeping things open-ended?  Is it different when traveling by land?


If anyone has experience with this, what is the reality of doing remote work in video editing / translating / writing?

I don't have immense amounts of experience, but in this point I'm willing to take jobs like Desktop Support or Hardware repair instead of sysops just so I can get established in the country.  

I suppose I'm looking for a bit of assurance from strangers in a similar situation as I, or for someone who has definite knowledge to tell me how to go about it.  It's difficult to stay positive when everything you apply for gets rejected.  Feels like I'm an idiot when I know that I'd be able to fill those positions flawlessly.

I'm my mid 20s, with a BS in Business, fluent in English and Spanish, conversational in Mandarin &amp; Tagalog, and with almost 5 years of Help Desk experience, among other things. I've always had the travel bug and I've been out before, the longest being 8 months in Asia. I've been back in the States for 9 months now, and I'm ready to go back out.

Its been my dream to go to Australia for years now. Between the weather, surfing, rugby, the laidback attitude, and how happy the country as a whole is compared to the rest of the OECD, it seems like the perfect place for me. I know its not perfect, but there's enough there to make me wanna check it out.

I've done some research and I'm generally familiar with the WHV path to sponsored employment, and eventually I would look to get permanent residence or citizenship (if everything works out). I've also seen a 2 year visa option for recent graduates who meet the government's wanted job list criteria, and I have to look more into that. I originally planned to do a combination of WWOOFing and migrant farming to build up cash, see the country, and qualify for the WHV extention before seeking out a more permanent job more along my career path that would sponsor me.

However, what I've read recently shows that its going through a downturn of sorts, mostly due to China. The mining boom seems to have ended, and I'm concerned that if I go to Australia in the next few months, I'll have a difficult time getting decent work, if any at all.

So my question is, is this a bad time to go? This has been my dream for the last several years, but I dont want to jump in blindly and set myself up for failure. Am I making this out to be worse that it seems? Or is this a valid concern?

Alternatively, I was also thinking about Canada, which may not have rugby, surfing, and a subtropical climate, but single payer healthcare and a functioning society sound nice.

Now first of all let me state that I have absolutely no idea about all this immigration legal stuff so I'm sorry if any of my questions here are stupid. I'd just really, really like to help her get out of the place she dislikes so much and move to Berlin.

I know what associations people generally have with ""German man meets Russian woman"" and fittingly enough, the first comment over at /r/germany was:
&gt;Make sure she's not trying to rip you off ;)

Don't worry about that part. I'm not looking to marry her (or anyone) and in fact she'd rather I didn't need to get involved in her efforts to move here at all. But I know how horrible German bureaucracy can be and want to help.

How can she legally move here without a proper employment? She's 25 and a freelance illustrator and designer and said she will definitely try and go job-hunting but from what I understand the chances of success are fairly slim, aren't they?

* The cost, by my estimates, is going to be between $25-30,000 USD for the initial year.

* I'm from an incredibly low income family and qualify for nearly all forms of assistance in the US (Pell Grants and such), though I'm not sure how much that will help me overseas.

* I don't have a large savings of my own.

My troubles happened almost 25 years ago and everything was handled in one proceeding.  Basically, I was a stupid teenager (a highschool dropout), got involved with the wrong crowd and had some B&amp;E's, and a theft by taking auto.   No violence.  No sexual crimes.  No drugs.  No jail time.  Released from probation early, and have been clean since. 

I've maintained gainful employment throughout my adult life.  I eventually got my GED and an AS degree, and started a part time landscaping business while working full time during the week.

I have a strong background in IT - web development, databases, server admin, tech support. 
I grew up on a farm and am experienced with operating heavy equipment.
I know a smattering of elementary French, and less Spanish. 

I'd like to stay on this continent, but would totally consider Europe or pretty much anywhere that doesn't have a built-in hatred of Americans, and is relatively safe and stable. 

I understand that Canada is a definite no, as is the UK.  I've read that Chile might be an option.  Are there any other south American countries I should consider (or avoid)?  How about Greenland, Iceland, or any of the western European countries? 

* Edited to add - expungement wasn't an option in my case.  My public defense attorney failed to bring First Time Offender plea, which is prerequisite in having a record expunged in my area.  I tried valiantly to have this corrected years ago, no luck (lots of empathy and 'sorries').  I did get my rights restored and am even able to run for office (no desire to).

Passport acquired, travel plans are made just not yet set in stone (tickets not purchased yet). I have several connections in New Zealand and have always wanted to visit there, seems like such a lovely place. Not to mention it's geographically closer to other points of interest for me, like Fiji, Australia and SE Asia.

Now, I have some questions:

I work for an online company, I am aware that I can not 'work' on a tourist visa, but since my work is remote based does that constitute 'work' in the eye of the NZ Government? It's not like I'm getting some job as an illegal immigrant doing dishes in a restaurant. More like, chilling on the couch in my room pounding away at the keyboard.

The company I work for is small and rapidly growing, there is talk of trying to relocate and register it as a NZ based business so that I can live there permanently. Any idea on what would need to be done to do that legally? We have a New Zealand based employee, who, if needed could be the 'on paper' owner of the company until permanent residency was acquired. Not sure if that is illegal or not. My concern is that when I go to visit for a month, I believe I can not legally re-enter the country for another year or 18months. I'm not 100%, but the time there was going to be spent looking at potential office space and finding out what needs to be done to become an adopted kiwi. Of course, plenty of time will be spent hiking, on the beach, and doing touristy things too.

I am sad because I truly want to live abroad once for a year at least.  I wanted to do it in college, but the only way I could do that was if I paid for it myself.  Well...if I can't work then I can't go abroad.  

I guess I should be happy that at least I have a full time job with benefits (or at least that is what I hear.  Not sure until I actually start).

But I feel really sad.  I may get a chance in a couple of years to go abroad after I get some work experience in this company.  Maybe go teach English abroad then.  But I really fear it will too late then.

We are visiting her family in Hong Kong for a few weeks, then considering living in China, at least for a few months. I have a few connections there, and they're interested in giving me a steady, full-time job (I work in the film industry).

Feel free to ask questions.",woopsnetsend,25,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/wukbc/my_journey_has_started_us_to_uk_as_a_student_feel/,"So I been planning on going to England as a student for a couple of years now and it is finally happening. I submitted my application to the university in England late June and got accepted today, if everything goes according to plan I should be there in the middle of September. That's if my visa doesn't get denied but I meet all the requirements so it shouldn't be an issue.

I was born in the US but grew up and went to school in Mexico before moving back to the US when I joined the Air Force so I was a little worried that I wouldn't meet the academic requirements at the universities in England. Thankfully I was considered a matured student and my work experience helped a lot.

I'm also extremely lucky to be able to qualify for the GI Bill which will cover like 95% of my tuition fees and living expenses so everything is set.

This is how I made it happen.

I moved to Mexico and enrolled at my local community college in the US. This allowed me to get a feel for school since it had been so long and I wanted to make sure I would be okay with it. This time everything was a lot easier, I felt more mature about things and actually enjoyed the classes which lead to a 4.0 GPA. Moving to Mexico also allowed me to save a ton of money even though the commute from home to school in the US was around 3-4 hours a day on the way there and 2 hours on the way back.

I got a job while in school and managed to balance work with school, then again the job was amazing and I was working from home as a freelancer so I had a ton of flexibility with the hours, but I had to spend hours and hours looking for that perfect job.

Started the process over two years ago, even though I only really been saving for around 9 months the process of getting everything approved and doing research on schools, budgeting, schools, etc has been in the works for a long time.

The scarifies I've made a long the way will allow me to attend school overseas for 3 years with little to no debt.

* I am a British Citizen as well as a United States Citizen! I do not need information on how to acquire a student or work visa, or citizenship. I have my passport and British Citizenship through Birth Right (my mother was born in Kent.)

* I am currently living in Central Florida.

* I am 19 years old. I will be 20 years old when I move (if I do.)

* I plan on leaving the end of spring semester in 2013 (Late April/Early May.)

* When I leave I will have my 2 year A.A degree. (I am aware that the UK does not recognize two year degrees but I have a question concerning transferring my credits.)

* I have some work experience, but not professional work experience. I worked at Universal Studios for a brief period of time when I was 16/17 and I worked at Publix Supermarkets for almost a year from the time that I was 17/18.

* I do not have ANY criminal record in the United States at all.

* English is my first language, I do not speak a foreign language at the moment but I plan on learning French and/or Italian.

* I have been to the UK before in 2009. I went to the Isle Of Wight, Hereford, Oxford, London, and Wales.

With that being said, I have a few inquiries about the best areas of England, my right of abode in the UK, education, and things of that nature. This post may be kind of long-winded but if you can answer my questions, please bear with me. I would really appreciate your help and input!

**Places I should visit/consider moving to**

I am planning on taking a trip to the UK this year in the off-season around mid to late December until early January to visit family/friends and to get a general lay of the land before making the big decision to move. I definitely plan on going to Kent, Brighton, and Liverpool as my family and friends live mainly in these three areas. My plans now are to  spend a considerable amount of time in Brighton as I have considered moving there for quite some time. However I would also like to visit other areas in case there is a better place for me out there! Therefore, I would like to know the best places for a university age student to visit. College towns, cities with a good night life, or just generally awesome and interesting cities.

**My right to abode as a non-natural born citizen**

As far as my right to live in the UK: On my British passport it says that I have the right of abode in the UK... Period. However, I have been told that even though I am a citizen I still need a certificate of naturalization since I wasn't born in the UK. Can anyone confirm or deny this? Any explanations or instructions would also be appreciated.

**Money and work**

Money will not be an issue, at least in regards to my available funds for moving and settling in. I have already saved a considerable amount of cash for this venture and my funds by next spring will be more than sufficient. However, having enough cash to maintain myself after my funds have run dry is a different story. I will, of course, need a job. Therefore, with my minimal work experience, what are my chances at getting a job (non-professional) to help keep me on my feet?


**Education**

As aforementioned, I will have my A.A degree upon my departure. For those who are reading this who are unfamiliar with the American education system, an A.A degree is a 2 year degree which basically states that you have completed your general core classes for university which may or may not be geared towards your choice of study for your desired profession. In my case, I will have a general A.A; This means I will have completed courses in areas of study such as math, science, humanities, history, and various elective courses (in my case, mainly business and humanities.) Additionally, I am aware that a UK University will not recognize a two year degree, as they are non-existent in the UK. At the moment, I do not plan on attending university immediately upon moving. But when I do plan on going, will any UK universities recognize my credits from my college in America? In other words, if I wish to pursue a three-year degree in England will ANY portion of my two years at university in the US count towards my degree in England?

**TL:DR**

**My questions:**

* What are the best places in the UK for a university age student or just in general?

* As a Non-natural born British Citizen who has already acquired their passport will I need a certificate of naturalization in order to stay in the UK?

* With minimal work experience, what are the chances of me getting a decent non professional job (part time or full time) in order to sustain myself in the UK?

* Will any of my credits from my two year general A.A degree in America transfer over to a UK university or college?

I am 29 y/o.. blond as hell, 6ft tall; I have traveled a bit through europe, central america and australia.. but never alone, and never in the 'rugged' way I am planning on this trip, and never for an indefinite period of time.

My questions are two fold, I guess.  I make my living as a programmer.. i have some connections in the states and can pretty likely get work; especially if I lower my rates to what would still be 10-50x average income (per hour, at least) for most of the places I am going.  

What kind of issues will I run into getting work from the USA, as an expat?  Can I make near the same kind of money working in my field down there?

Also, what are some things I should look for / be aware of when looking for a place to settle?

The dream/ideal situation is getting a decent plot of land with fast internet that I could bring a bunch of like minded family and friends to.

I've studied a bit about the social uprisings that have happened over the last decade or two and have a lot of respect for it; a big part of what I want to accomplish while traveling is getting a good feel for the peoples' struggles there.

I am definitely not trying to go down there and have a swank existence, at least for the traveling bit.  I want to be comfortable, but would like my money to go a long way and am willing to rough it quite a bit, couch surf etc.

I get the impression that as a loner white guy I am probably a target to a lot of people, though I really suspect that my outward appearances will probably make me seem less juicy than the typical rich american tourist.

And I think I want to go to Argentina.,jenniferwillow,32,14,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/l5nwg/i_think_i_want_out_and_i_think_i_want_to_go_to/,"Everyone who has been paying attention to US politics knows that things have gotten out of hand.  There's insane drug laws, attitudes towards education, healthcare, finances, the politics are a mess, the religious nuts are out to take over everything, there's so many laws everybody can be convicted of something.  The list goes on and on.  It's like the grains of sand that eventually make up a beach, albeit a polluted nasty beach with a few nice spots.

So my wife (we're lesbians) and I were talking today about future plans.  She's currently going to premed school.  I have a MA in archaeology.  She's getting fluent in Spanish, it's been a while, but I'd probably pick up the language pretty quickly again if immersed in it within a year.  I also do tech support for Dell.  I'd love to actually get into farming (strange path, to go from archaeology to tech support to farming).  And this would not be my first time on the international living abroad rodeo.  I lived in the UK for just over a year while in graduate school.  So I've done this before, but it's been nearly a decade and a half, and this is a country with a different language.

I'm honestly not sure what questions I need to be asking.  I'd like to maybe convince my wife to look into medical school in Argentina.  We'll probably finish up undergrad here in the states (currently in Nashville TN).  I'm not sure what the policies are in Argentina regarding medical school for foreign students.  She's very smart, much more so than I am.  I know undergraduate schools in Argentina are essentially free.  Not sure about financial opportunities for med-school though, or even what Med schools to look at.  She'd like to work out in the country/rural areas if that helps.  As for me, I'd like to do farming of some sort, but if I need to do something else to support her while she's in school I'll do it.  In terms of farming I'd love to raise cattle and sheep, and grow medical plants.  I know those are not yet legal though, but neither are they here in the states.  

So, that's where we stand.  An interest but no certain plans.  What do I need to be looking at to make this happen?  Is this a good idea?  Any negatives I need to know about?  Positives that I don't yet know of?

Can anyone help?",steamwhistler,28,6,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/klszs/i_want_to_move_from_canada_to_the_us_ill_have_an/,"Guys, just found this subreddit a couple days ago and I'm hoping someone can give me advice. From what I've found online, the easiest and most-distributed work visa is the NAFTA visa. You can get this if you have certification in any of the professions [on this list](http://www.tnvisaexpert.com/overview/nafta_job_list/). I'm 23, and I'll be finishing my degree in English at the end of this year, but I have no certifications otherwise.

The reason I want to do this is because my girlfriend is American, currently going to school in Texas. Once she finishes, which will happen around the end of the summer or christmas of next year, she'd like to live in a coastal city like Portland or Miami. Vancouver is also a possibility but I think she'd prefer to stay in the US. So, I'm not exactly sure yet what state I'm aiming for but it will be wherever she is.

I'm also not clear on some basic aspects of this whole process. Can a non-US citizen apply for a job, and then use the job acceptance as the basis for obtaining a green card?f Can a company do you a favor by agreeing to fill out a bunch of paperwork that explains why they're hiring you instead of a local?

I'm contemplating hiring an immigration lawyer just to explain every facet of this to me, because some of the information I've found is conflicting, and plus there's just so much of it. My girlfriend gets super-pissed at me whenever I point out how difficult it will be for me to get a green card, because some friends have told her about people they know who got work in the US like it was the easiest thing in the world.

One more thing: Yes, I've thought about the marriage possibility, but that's a last-ditch option right now. We've been an item for a couple years but have only spent about 4 months together in-person, and it's not the right time in the relationship, or in either of our lives, to be getting married.

Any advice on getting work in the US is hugely appreciated...

Fell in love. Married. Got a green card. She is missing home and family. Moving to Germany may be the only way to save the marriage.    

I am 30 years old, have a BA in MIS, and have been working in IT for the last 10 years, currently at a large software company. We are multi-national, but many of the jobs in Germany are either software development, or administrative, none of which I have a lot of experience in.    

I don't speak any German but I am more than willing to learn. I have been to Germany (NRW area- Cologne, Dortmund), and I loved it. I have virtually no debt, just a student loan that with my upcoming tax return and cashing out about as much stock, I could have paid off by mid-Feb. I am definitely what you would call risk-adverse, but I seem to have a lot of things going for me if I did decide to go: German wife, no debt, no kids, decent sized 401k.    

Though the thought of it still scares me, only because I am worried about not finding work. This may be unfounded but I'm hoping other Americans in Germany, or German citizens can comment. If I could find work as an American, hopefully in the field I am experienced in, and without having to speak a lot of German (at least not right away), I would do it. It's scary for me, but the thought of living and working comfortably in Europe, especially Germany with my wife, sounds like a dream.

I'm from Norway. A long time ago I fell in love with a girl from Japan, both mid 20s. We've been together for a long time now and we've been playing with the idea of getting married many times...unfortunately it seems about as realistic as winning the lottery.

Neither one of us has education that one could say as being in high demand and thats where the problem lies.  I'm just a regular teacher (though im starting to get tired of it and wondering if I should get another education...), and she is basically the same having worked as a teacher and in nursery schools. So in the end we both have an education thats related to education in one way or another...(none of us majored in education though..)

So basically, if I move to Japan -&gt; I won't find any jobs -&gt; We are fucked.

If she moves to Norway -&gt; She won't find any jobs probably -&gt; We are fucked. And you basically can't live on one persons income here, its just not built like that. I think she is more likely to find a job thats ok paid here though.

I can speak Japanese, but I don't have any in demand skills. She doesn't speak Norwegian well, but yeah I think its an easy language to learn.

For years I have had an obsession with Europe and I’m trying to get some real advice on potential careers that are both realistic and would allow me to have a decent amount of job opportunities there. 

I was stationed in Italy and Turkey for a couple of years and I’ve had the privilege of traveling to Slovenia, Austria, Switzerland, Germany, France, England, and Ireland, so this is hardly a rash, spur of the moment idea without any prior experiences of traveling there. I honestly and wholeheartedly want to move my wife, my two Dachshunds, and myself to Europe in order for us to start and raise a family there.

Before I get any further I want to point out the fact that my wife is from France, so that already alleviates ‘some’ of the headache of actually acquiring proper residency permits to start off. Also, I’m aware of the necessity of learning the language in which ever country I might be able to live in, but I’m trying to find potential jobs that might allow me to work with English while I’m learning the local language.

I’m currently half way through a bachelors degree in Psychology, but I’m more than willing to change my major in order to be more employable and have a viable career in something useful in Europe. I have a natural inclination towards psychology, history, and working with people so I would like to find something that is in some way shape or form involved with one of these things. 

So at last…What are some careers that would give me the option and flexibility of being able to live in a couple different countries in Europe? I appreciate all help and suggestions!

So, to sum everything up, i'm from the UK, currently studying at a good University and am due to graduate with (most likely) a first class in Economics Bsc. I have had work experience placements with large financial firms in London &amp; Thailand. I can also speak fluent spanish if that helps.

I **LOVE** America. I've been every summer for the last 7 years, and have been pretty much everywhere. If I could move i'd want to move to either San Francisco, Los angeles, New York, Palm Springs or Phoenix. 

From my understanding of the visas, the main problems are..
1. No firms will sponsor me because it's too expensive and I can't really offer anything that an American graduate can't.
2. I can't get the work experience Visa (18 months??) until I have 5 years experience.

I'm looking to pursue a masters degree (either in UK or US), or maybe even a pHD if it'll help me live in the US permanently. 

What are my best options?

I've been working on a PhD for about 6 months now with the promise of payment, but also with the notable lack of it. I'm getting that sinking feeling that the money I need to survive (not greedy, just want to be able to afford food and shelter for the duration without borrowing off of relatives any more) will not arrive, and I'll be confirming whether or not this is the case this week.

If that is what's to happen, that I won't have any cash coming my way from college for the next 3 and a half years, then I think it's time to fly the nest. It's always been my plan to leave eventually, but I hadn't previously entertained the possibility as early as I am doing now.

Ideally, I'd be looking to continue/start a new PhD in my field (Maths/Electrical Engineering - Digital Signal Processing). At the moment, as my options are limited here (Ireland) and there are no appealing options in the UK, I'd appreciate any advice anyone can give/knows on good research centers in North America, with regard to Maths or Electrical Engineering or Physics.

If it helps, I also speak German, Russian and Arabic. I can't see them being much use in the US or Canada, but you never know... Thanks in advance!

I've been doing a little bit of research and the vast majority of jobs are teaching English and require a college/university degree. I don't have that. I came straight out of high school and went straight to corporate, office jobs where I've been working ever since.

I don't really want to go to uni and doing so now would kind of defeat the purpose as I don't really have the cash for it (I'm debt-free, however) and I'd be closer to (or over, depending on the agree) 30  by the time I was done.

The places I've been thinking are places in Asia - like China, or South Korea or Japan. I think I could pick up new languages and I'd be willing to learn. But nobody seems to want people without degrees.

Any success stories about doing things like this? I don't want to immigrate permanently (although it'd be nice, I'm kind of tired of living where I am) but I would like to make a go of living overseas for a year somewhere completely different to what I'm used to.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the replies. Looks like I'm shit out of luck. Time to start looking at other options.

Masters degree in Europe feasible?,mattyice87,26,8,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/102zfc/usa_masters_degree_in_europe_feasible/,"   Hello and thanks for taking the time to read this. The quick back story is I'll be 25 in November, have a (useless) bachelors in Political Science from a state university and was lucky enough to get a job right after graduation. I've got about 2 and a half years of decent work experience and no debt (other than my car). I live with my girlfriend who is in a similar situation, but we both feel very stagnant in our jobs and where we live. 

   We both have a passion for traveling but haven't been able to do it very much because it's so expensive and we don't make a lot of money or get a lot of time off. We recently got to go to Ireland for a week (we drove 800+ miles while there and saw so much, amazing trip) and we absolutely loved it, but it just made us want to travel more. 

   I've been wanting to get my masters degree and recently found out that some EU countries have very low (or no) tuition for international students. This seems like a great way to further my education (especially considering I would have to take out $20k - $25k for tuition alone even in my home state) and live abroad, two things that I want very badly to do. We're pretty flexible about where we're willing to live, but I've been looking about Munich and Amsterdam and they both look amazing. I don't want to ramble so I'll get to what I have questions about:


* I know nothing about student loans. Do I have any good options for financing my masters if I'm attending a foreign college?


* I know it depends on the school, but do I stand a chance at getting in to halfway decent European universities, or am I wasting my time? (3.41 GPA from a US state university, over 2 years of work experience)

* In what order should I tackle this? Apply and get accepted to a school, get financing figured out, get my visa, then move?


* We don't currently speak anything other than English, but would be willing to learn as much as possible before we travel with the goal of becoming fluent speakers while we live there. I've read that a lot of the masters programs I'm looking at are taught in English, so it wouldn't be a deal breaker if we're not fluent on the day we arrive, right?

1345473851.0,19,self.IWantOut,yivw9,"I see a lot of people wanting to go from US -&gt; UK. I just received my visa, so I'd love to answer any questions!",tachyons22,20,1,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/yivw9/i_see_a_lot_of_people_wanting_to_go_from_us_uk_i/,"Hi r/IWantOut. I've been on this board for just about the whole time that I've had this account. I notice that there seem to be a lot of ""I want to go to the UK from US how do I do this"" type posts, and it's a little frustrating that a) you can't search to find previous posts, and b) you can't search on Google to answer your question. /rant. 

Anyway, I just got [my visa](http://i.imgur.com/nBa6m.jpg) (my photo was embarrassing, so I replaced it with my cat) and it's valid for the first year of my four-year programme. I went through all the loops and did all the jumps, and managed to come out alive and successful. I do plan on acquiring UK citizenship in the future, so I also know quite a bit about other types of visas.

A few things that I'd like to point out for those that are considering the UK:

* People will judge you when you tell them of your plans. I worked at a small Italian restaurant which was like a second family, and they would ask me about England. Things that I've heard from them or the customers that have overhead and proceeded to talk to me about it include: ""Their healthcare sucks. You'll get sick and no one will help you."" ""Their dentists suck, don't go there."" ""Everything is so expensive, you'll hate it and come back."" ""Why would you leave America? It's such a great country."" ""Just don't stay there too long! You might meet a British boy and marry him. Don't marry Europeans, only marry Americans.""

* You'll find out that most people don't understand basic geography. They seem to associate England = London. So whenever someone would talk to me about it a second time, they'd always think I was going to London (because they're the same thing, right?!). Or they think that Scotland/Midlands/some random place they've heard of is an hours drive from where I'll be studying (Kent).

* It's expensive. I'm sorry, but that's the truth. The application is expensive, the living is expensive, everything is expensive. I'm lucky where I don't have to pay for travel expenses, but if I did I don't know how I'd be able to add those costs plus shipping all my stuff (~$200) plus going to uni ($17k) plus renting a flat and living there (~$1.4k/month).

* Talk to your parents about it (if you're under-age, as most of you seem to be). My senior year in high school I was certain that I was going to attend l'Université de Montréal, and my parents were on board. I wound up not applying (personal issues at the time), then took a gap year. When I said that I wanted to go to England, they thought I was joking, but they are extremely supportive now.

* If you want to get a Tier 4 visa (the one that lets you go to school there), you have to know what your major is. None of the ""I'm going into my state uni undecided and plan on switching my major around 2 or 3 times"" bullshit that happens in America. There is no ""Undecided."" And if you aren't 90% sure, then don't apply. If you want to switch at a later time, you don't have to make a new visa unless the major you're switching to lasts longer than the one you went in on (which it will if it's a completely different subject, i.e. Architecture -&gt; Astrophysics, because you'll have to take all the courses you've missed). If you want to switch before you've applied, it gets a little more complicated because they have to issue a new CAS. However, if you want to switch to a different uni, you do have a make a new visa application.

It is an easy process, just a lot of stuff that you have to do. So if you have any questions, whether it's now that I've posted this or in a month when you've used that search function instead of making a new post (way to go!), feel free to ask.

* [Panajachel](http://correresmidestino.com/panajachel/) is the main touristic point and probably the most tacky village. Mostly a main street with a market and services for gringos... great views on the lake though. Lots of people who visit the lake only stop there.

Ireland and the UK, being the only two English-speaking countries in the EU, seem to be my only hope for gainful employment. I speak French after having lived in France for a year, but much of it is gone now to the point that it's not enough to land a job. I assume most people are focusing on these countries for similar language reasons as well.

This is the brief research I've done so far for just Ireland:
There are three ways to work in Ireland as a foreigner, in order of ease of approval it seems to be: intracompany transfer, green card (salary of 60k+ euros, or just 30k+ euros in certain industries), and work permit (no salary restriction). These are explained here: http://www.fas.ie/en/Job+Seeker/Working+and+Training+Abroad/Recruiting+outside+Europe.htm

Green card requirements go into more detail here: http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/employment/migrant_workers/employment_permits/green_card_permits.html

And the FAS/EURES websites for looking up jobs are here: http://ec.europa.eu/eures/main.jsp?acro=job&amp;lang=en&amp;catId=482&amp;parentCategory=482 and http://jobseeker.fas.ie/
If you don't qualify for a green card, then your potential employer must have posted their opening on those websites for at least two months without finding a suitable candidate. I assume, hopefully, this is a either-or situation, as there are almost no jobs in the EURES database for Ireland (100 jobs across all industries, and over half of them seem to be for French or Finnish speakers).

Finally, a list of ineligible occupations: http://www.djei.ie/labour/workpermits/elements/ineligible.htm

Yet, its saying about 500 euros for an EU student (which I am not).  

Edit:  I'm interested in studying Biology.  Not sure if I want to look at Forestry, Marine Science or Medicine yet.  

I'm also in the 3rd term of my German sequence o.O  I'm sincerely interested in taking classes in German!  That would be cool.  n.n


**tl;dr How much should I as an American student (not being an EU student) expect to typically pay per semester/year?**

Edit: Here's what I've found.  Edit: Fixed cost of living from 10 months to 12.

* 500 euros = Current typical tuition per semester
* 800 euros = Typical Cost of Living Per Month (varies from about 600-900 euros depending on location)
* 200 euros = Fee per semester (This is on the high end, but is at the University of Cologne which I'm considering.  Most vary from anywhere between 50 to 175 euros)

* 500 euros • 2 semesters = 1000 euros per year in tuition
* 800 euros • 12 months = 9,600 euros per year in cost of living
* 200 euros • 2 semester = 400 euros in fees

9,400 euros per year

1 euro = 1.43 United States Dollars

11,000 euros • 1.43 = **$15,730 per year**

Does this look right to you guys?  Are there any things I'm not considering?  

And yes.  This is somewhat on the expensive side.  I'll continue looking into other countries like Norway.

**Second, much cheaper option with input from Countvontroll (check out his comment for some good information):**

* 0 euros • 2 semesters = Free tuition at most public universities
* 700 euros • 12 months = 8,400 euros (This really depends on where one lives)
* 100 euros • 2 semesters = 200 euros per year in fees (Dependent on school)

8,600 euros per year = **$12,298 per year**

I apologize if this is a common type of post.  I figured I'd just throw myself out there and see if anyone responds.  (Thanks in advance if you do.)

I'm nearing the end of my sophomore year in undergrad, from where I will be graduating with a double-major in philosophy and anthropology.  I'm a capable, professional person, and I most certainly don't mind enjoying life, so I want to find something that reflects what I am able to do.

Primarily, I don't want any bullshit.

- I'm not independently wealthy, my parents don't have a lot of money, and I'm going to have the most minor of loans to pay back once I've graduated.  I am NOT concerned about how much money I'm going to make after the fact, which explains the philosophy degree.

- I *love* anthropology, and would not at all mind if there was a realistic opportunity for me to continue incorporating it into my life.

- I am competent at speaking English (using proper grammar, strong vocabulary, etc.), and I have had some experience with instruction before (though nothing professional-- I've done some close work with a high school marching band as an assistant director).  Teaching English in a foreign country (a poor one would be good) is completely acceptable... maybe even preferable to whatever else I could be doing.  It doesn't have to be fancy.  I just want to be somewhere where the focus is on people rather than profit.

- I'm 20 years old.  I have a large family and they tend to not give very much support to novel ideas.  (This could be a problem.)

So, IWantOut, do you have any general, or even specific, suggestions?  My post-graduation plans are non-existent, but I'm open to pretty much anything.  I might just need some help finding a direction.

I qualify for everything on that visa, which isn't a problem (I'll be graduating mid year, and I'm planning on arriving about November).

I was just wondering how people actually GO ABOUT getting a sponsorship? This sounds really dumb... but do I write the companies a letter? Ask them to ""sponsor"" me? What's in it for them?
I know there are websites supplied however they seem to have to include you in their program where you pay a fee (usually around $1500) but you still need to find a sponsor and a job offer before you leave. Then on the other hand, there are some other companies that ARE the sponsor, and you don't need a job offer before you leave and can find one at your own pace once you arrive. (eg: http://workandtravelusa.com.au/programs/work-and-travel-12months/options-and-costs/) However they are also quite pricey.

What I am getting at is, can I accomplish this alone without having to pay these ridiculous fees that the exchange companies are asking? $1500 average NOT including comprehensive health insurance, accommodation, flights etc is a LOT of money, and really who doesn't want to save money where they can?

So please, can you share with me how you got your sponsorships? And as for job offers, why would employees wait for you to turn up when they can hire someone equally as qualified from the US?

I have done some initial research into jobs in the area receiving interviews etc. However, most companies are put off by the lack of a VISA. My options as I see it are:

1. Keep looking, targeting larger companies with the resources for VISA sponsorship
2. Move over as a tourist and conduct job hunting that way.
3. K1 VISA (She's a dual national), however that looks to me to take around 6 months.

US ----&gt; New Zealand,vitojohn,22,5,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14qt2c/i_eventually_want_out_us_new_zealand/,"This is not an immediate thing, I still want to finish my schooling here (Graphic Design) and, of course, save enough money up to make the move. This post is more focused on getting advice from other NZ'ers on what I should be getting prepared for/what I can start doing now to speed up the process of being ready to get out. 

My girlfriend and I would eventually love to live in New Zealand. I'm still working on my degree/portfolio and she has her LVN. She'd eventually like to return to school and get her RN, but that's on the backburner for how. How is the current job market for these two careers over there (if anyone knows)? From my own research, the general economy seems to be ""not good, but not bad"". I'm not a whiz at understanding economics, though.

Also, I understand the cost a living is a bit higher than the US. Any US expats care to comment? What should I be expecting as far as general grocery shopping and living expenses?

We're not ""fleeing"" our lives here or anything, just kind of fed up with the United States government, and essentially the society in which America is becoming. You would think that, as a nation with so much diversity, people would be learning to get along better with those who aren't the same as them...but it just seems to be getting more polarizing. People don't even know their own neighbors, and everyone just wants to rush through life as fast as possible. From the people I've talked to about NZ, it has been presented to me as a place where life is taken a bit...slower? Not sure if that's the exact term I'm looking for, but coming from California and living smack-dab in the middle of San Diego and Los Angeles, everything just seems so saturated and fake.

I've just got a few more questions, which I'll bullet-point:

• I'm Agnostic-atheist (girlfriend is a nonpracticing catholic) and while I don't feel ""militant"" at all about my lack of beliefs, I'm tired of how strongly religious people react when they discover that about me. Is religion as important to people in NZ as it is here? 

•When the time comes to job hunt, should we be looking in smaller areas, that are more desperate for people, or are the larger cities more ample with opportunity? 

•How is the internet connection over there?

•What is your opinion on the current government? I understand that everyone has general distaste for politicians, but do you at least feel you can trust your government?


And for now, that's pretty much it. I would be greatly appreciative of any other advice that any expats or NZ'ers could give. Thanks in advance!",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,False,,,True,t3_14qt2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/14qt2c/i_eventually_want_out_us_new_zealand/,

You guys were great on helping me get my situation squared away for moving to Australia and that is currently in the works (cross fingers)...as I keep reading new posts I am noticing a trend, especially as we get closer to elections here in the US.  ""I HATE THE USA FOR X REASONS, AND I WANT OUT, rabble rabble""....  I understand that folks have come here for guidance, but I think there needs to be a way to offer a basic understanding of a few things.

1.  Grass is always greener on the other side.
2.  Do you really know how things work in the country you want to go to, or do you just believe it's better?
3.  Do you understand in the slightest what  the minimum requirements are for where you want to go.
4.  Do you have anything to offer, work experience, education?
5.  Do you even speak another language?
6.  Just because you live in the USA, doesn't mean you speak and write it well enough to teach it.

* 23 years old
* B.S. in Neuroscience
* 1 yr sales experience with an international pharmaceutical company after graduation
* Born and raised in USA
* Fluent in English and completely communicative in Spanish (circle talk)
* No criminal convictions
* I am pretty set on Buenos Aires - I want to make it work
* Wanting to live there 1-3 years
* I plan to have $10,000 USD in savings by the time I leave

Alright, so I graduated with a B.S. in neuroscience in summer of 2011 and immediately began working as a pharmaceutical representative for an international pharmaceutical company. I am still currently working for this company. 

I am planning on giving my two weeks notice mid-September and moving to Buenos Aires on October 1st of this year with my 21-year-old boyfriend (no undergrad degree, American, a bit of Spanish). That gives me four months to do what I need to do before I leave. 

I should have $10,000 USD by the time I leave. We are very low maintenance and plan on getting a one bedroom apartment in the city. My biggest concern is finding us jobs that allow us to sustain ourselves beyond the savings we will be bringing with us. In fact, I'd like to not use too much of that savings if at all possible. 

The other large problem is that Argentina does not provide a working holiday visa to Americans, so I think that the maximum visa they provide is 90 days. I definitely want to be there longer than that. Does anyone have any advice on how we could go about living there for at least a year?

My biggest question is where do I go from here? Is this a realistic plan? I have a passport, so do I need a visa or is it the kind that they just stamp once you arrive at the airport? Again, we are very low maintenance. We just want to live there, become fluent in Spanish and have some good experiences. Of course, we don't want to have any crazy trouble either.

Thank you so much in advance for any advice!


**EDIT TO ADD** Again, the biggest concern is the visa situation if anyone is comfortable commenting on that. :)

**EDIT 2:** I'm not expecting of course to make anywhere near the sort of money I am making now in Argentina - just enough to sustain a very very cheap lifestyle.

I lived with her there for 8 months on a study abroad trip as well. The relationship ended but my interest in the country hasn't. 

I'm finishing my Master's degree in Chinese Language in Columbus this year, but I have no intention of living in China. I want to create a plan to move to Finland for an extended period. I will be in a good amount of debt (66k~) at the end of this program in the US so I think employment would be the best option. I'm aware that that is incredibly difficult though and am flexible in how to go about doing this.

I have a bachelors in Political Science and shortly will have a Masters in East Asian Languages and Literature (Chinese). If anyone is familiar with Finnish companies or organizations that would find this background useful please pass them on. I am trying to compile a list of possible employers in country that I could contact.

The other option is studying. I haven't ruled this out but it will difficult given my finances. I am planning on taking a Masters in Economics at the University of Helsinki. The problem is I will need to locate atleast some part time work to support myself and pay my US student loans. Does anyone know the availability of work for international students in Finland? What are the regulations for student workers? 

Keeping in mind, I do plan to learn Finnish but it will be at least a year before I can operate in the language effectively. 

If anyone has any general information that might be helpful I'll take that too. I have a year to prepare and line this up.

*Edit* Since I will have to pay student loans in dollars, I will have to keep an American bank account. Does anyone know of a good way to transfer money between European and American bank accounts without accruing too many fees?

*Edit - 2* If anyone has some tips specifically about finding employment in Finland that would be highly appreciated. I tried to find employment there right after my student visa had run out but in those 4 months I was unsuccessful. The employment route seems to be the best way to go because after two years of employment it seems that one qualifies as a permanent resident, with all the rights that status entails.

As a lot of other users on this sub, and the TEFL sub, I too want to make a change for myself. Excuse the venting; the next 2 paragraphs can be totally skipped. They'll be explanations as to who I am, and how I got to this point.

I'm an Asian American guy, 24 years old. Born and raised in Oakland, CA. I'm the son of two refugees from the Southeast Asian highlands; we have no home country, and other peoples consider us mountain folk. As a lot of you may understand, there was a definite clash of culture/identity growing up. My mother completed high school, starting from the 8th grade. My father has no education. They've made a great living for my family. They too are really Americanized, but hold some of our Mien customs to high esteem. This was rather passed down to me, and it would push me to excel.

I've graduated from UCLA, after a 1 year stint at USF and 2 years at Laney College. It took me 5 years to do so, and in that same sense, I lived in West LA (what a shocker compared to East Oakland) and Rome, Italy. There was a sense of ignorance of me when I was still living at home &amp; in the Bay Area -- same friends who really got no where, same acceptance of the status quo for people within my community. Once I got out to LA, that shit changed my life. I hadn't known what it was like to not not look over my shoulder while walking anywhere by myself. It was a complete shock. And I fucking loved it. I began to look at my hometown with a bit of dissidence: ""life"" can't be how Oakland had shown me! I went out to Europe to study abroad, and lived there 5 months. This, totally screwed me up in 2 ways: 1. why the hell was I never fortunate enough to experience such a thing, and 2. this study abroad trip will end, eventually. Which it did, and I returned to graduate and ""come home""

Flash forward to june 2012, I've returned to Oakland. I left June 2010 (with 2-4 day visits back), but now am home full-time. Honestly, it feels as if nothing has changed. My friends are doing the same ol' shit, the city is the same (with the exception of an invasion of yuppies and hipsters, but they're cool). I am having a hard time grasping this sense of ... simplicity. Life moved in fast forward for 2 years, and now I find myself becoming complacent and picking up where I left off prior to the departure.

My plans are to teach english abroad, as are a lot of folk. I have background in teaching (although not formalized). I spent a total of 5 years at an after school program at the elementary school I attended as a kid. I really want to make a return to Europe (I loved Italy and it allowed me to meet my relatives in France for the first time). I have read a lot of threads on the CELTA certification, which is the one I will take. 

I'm curious to know the positives &amp; negatives of taking CELTA here at home (SF has a University that is certified by Cambridge), versus taking it abroad. Finances won't allow me to pack up and move at the moment, but I do have enough to get the certification out of the way now. The plan would be to move to Europe (and crash my relatives' place in Southern France) while looking for a job.

As the title says, right now I'm a Spanish PhD student that expects to hold the dissertation in early autumn. The thesis subject is Temporal Data Mining, which apparently is regarded as an attractive field. Unfortunately, I don't have any ""real"" experience in IT, and my IT skills (such as web development, DB management or sysadmin skills, for instance) have become a bit rusty over these last few years, so it would seem that my best bet would be aiming to continue in this line of work. Whether the job is in academia or not is not really important (to me) right now, although I do have some experience as a TA due to the grant I held.

According to the Citizenship and Immigration Canada page [CIC](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/index.asp) I'm eligible for the IEC initiative that would allow me to work there up to one year, if I understand correctly. However, if possible, I would like to work there ""permanently"" (basically until I'm deported).

My main questions here are:

* 1) A PhD in Spain is considered worse than worthless. Is it the same in Canada? Should I desist looking for a job there until I manage to find some real experience?

* 2) I speak what I consider to be fluent English (the dissertation was written in English and, for what it's worth, I passed the CPE exam last Christmas), but I do not currently speak (any) French. Is it necessary to speak French to be able to move there or can I learn it while I'm there? I also speak some German, and I took an intermediate (B1) level a couple of weeks ago, although the results won't come until October.

* 3) If I understand correctly, I need to have a job offer before applying for any kind of work permit. Am I understanding correctly?

* 4) Is there something else I should be taking into account that I seem to be missing?

While I used to be a developer now I lead a team of four and do things that are more on the operations side.  I don't do much else and it's gotten incredibly boring (not to mention our management in our department has steadily gone downhill).  I've been applying like crazy to jobs in Europe and other parts of the US with my current company and I often don't even a response. I've had a total of two interviews in 18 months and didn't get either. I really, really want out of where I currently live.  So clearly my skills aren't useful. My plan is to take some computer science classes online, do some of my own side projects so I have some code I can show and go from there.  …and possibly learn some German.  Obviously it'd be great if I could get a computer science degree but mine's in business and I don't have the time or money to get another one.  So it looks like I'm stuck here for another ridiculously hot summer (I live in one of the southwest's poorest cities) which is dead depressing because my goal was really to get out of here to anywhere this year.  Not gonna happen now.   Sorry, just needed to vent a bit and possibly offer a cautionary tale. I think my plan is fairly solid, it will just take a good 6 months to a year to fully implement but I'm always open to suggestions and advice.",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,False,,,True,t3_1ebe5h,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1ebe5h/just_need_to_vent_not_even_working_for_an_mnc_is/,

I have a BA in English Literature and I've got a lot of experience tutoring and teaching English. I don't have TEFL or CELTA certificates. My Vietnamese is pretty fluent; I can't write it, but I can read some.

I thought that since I could speak Vietnamese I would have a slight advantage at finding a teaching position there. But recently, I've been hearing from people that schools in Vietnam want white people to teach at their schools. I guess it makes them look more legit if you're a non-asian from Canada/US, Europe, Australia etc. Is it true that looking Vietnamese puts me at a disadvantage at finding a job there?

I was wondering if the teaching thing doesn't work out, are there job opportunities for Vietnamese-Americans there? I also do photography and write and would love to maybe find a job in the tourism or magazine industry.

Ok, let me try to give some context on my current situation first. Sometime very soon, this month for sure, my SO (29/m) and I (26/f) are getting married in a super informal, rushed ceremony so that we can apply for him to get Canadian permanent residence and move in with me finally after 4+ years long distance.

I'm getting worried though. Looking over all the immigration forms and stuff, it seems they expect quite a lot to prove the legitimacy of the relationship. I think it'll be easy to prove we're a legitimate couple, with years of daily chat logs and plenty of travel documents (though only a handful of pictures together -- we're not really picture-taking people), but our marriage on the other hand, I'm getting worried.

I mean, it IS a marriage of convenience in a sense. We wouldn't be getting married before living together if immigration wasn't at stake. The way we talk about it, we don't even plan to call each other husband and wife until we have a formal wedding with friends and family sometime down the line after we've lived together for a while and are sure that's what we want. But we really want to be together, and that's worth the risk of getting married before we're 100% ready.

I'd love to hear from other people who've gone or are going through spouse-sponsored immigration, especially to Canada but other countries too, and especially anyone whose marriage was strictly for the purpose of getting the two of you together when otherwise you would have waited to tie the knot or never gotten married. Just how much proof of the legitimacy of the marriage, not just the relationship, do they demand? How critical are they of that sort of thing?",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,False,,,True,t3_1dq180,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1dq180/question_for_anyone_whos_gotten_married_and/,

1367173552.0,16,self.IWantOut,1da8r8,How to minimize chances of getting scammed? Finally found a law firm to help get EU citizenship! (Father was born in former Portuguese colony),,21,5,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1da8r8/how_to_minimize_chances_of_getting_scammed/,"My father was born in Goa (part of India) back when it was still a Portuguese colony. That makes him eligible to apply for Portuguese nationality, after which I can apply for it and get a Portuguese (EU) passport. 

I've done a lot of research on the process, and it is very difficult to get this citizenship. When Portugal was forced out of Goa, they left in a hurry and didn't take Goan residents' records with them. The application process is tough, because the Portuguese government needs to ensure that you are really entitled to Portuguese nationality, due to many Indians who forged documents to make it look like they were born in Goa.

This has led to my biggest challenge with this, which is that the process for application is not clearly defined at all! Every Portuguese embassy and consulate in various countries, as well as many different Portuguese law firms I've talked to, have all given me different answers about the process and what is required. Some have even told me it is not possible based for our particular situation.

I have finally decided after much research to move the process forward. I emailed several law firms in Lisbon, Portugal who claim to do Portuguese nationality law (and specifically stated Goa somewhere on their website) and found a lawyer who seems to know what she is talking about, but I'd like to know how to do my due diligence to ensure I won't be getting scammed in the process. There are at least a couple of ways to get scammed that I can think of: one is that the process costs between 1000 and 2000 Euro (similar fees quoted by the other law firms as well), so it's a lot of money to lose; the other is that we will be providing a lot of important documents to them, like original birth certificates of me and my parents, marriage certificates, and passports, as well as power of attorney, and it will cause a lot of problems to have these things lost/stolen/destroyed or misused/abused.

So I want to do some proper due diligence to make sure I won't get scammed. I'd like to get your opinions on the firm itself (any red flags?), as well as your help in seeing if there are additional questions I should be asking (see list of questions further down), and any other ways to find out if it is a legitimate business or a fly-by-night operation.

The website of the law firm is http://www.cscadvogada.com and the lawyer's LinkedIn is http://www.linkedin.com/pub/clara-da-costa-csc-lawyer-portugal/63/845/b1b).

Here are the pros:

* Their email response times aren't that bad
* The website seems decent enough
* The English (on the website and in their email responses) are good enough
* Google street-viewing the address (http://goo.gl/maps/8F4nM) seems to show that it does exist, even though it doesn't look totally professional. The gold sign in the middle of the street view I've linked to seems to say 'ADVOGADOS' in all capital letters (Portuguese word for lawyer)

Here are the cons:

* The website has a very low Alexa rank (6,800,000)
* archive.org has a record of it going back to only July 2010 and the whois records show the domain was registered only in November 2013 (even though her LinkedIn profile says she worked there from 2007)
* Her LinkedIn profile only has 6 connections
* The law firm seems to be just a one-person operation

What are your first impressions? Trustworthy? Or do you see any red flags that I might be blind to?

Also, I am sending an email to her with the following questions. Are there additional questions I should be asking?

* How many Portuguese nationality applications have you worked on for people born in Goa that were successful?
* How many Portuguese nationality applications have you worked on for people born in Goa that were unsuccessful? Why were they unsuccessful?
* I see you have posted your LinkedIn information on your website, could you please add my father ([provide link]) as a contact? I have told him about you.
* Are you the only lawyer at your firm, or are there other lawyers who will be involved? I ask because I've heard the Portuguese nationality application can take a very long time, and I wonder who we could contact if you are unavailable (vacation, illness, etc)
* How many years has your current law firm been in official operation?
* Does your law firm have any office or presence in Goa itself?

What additional ways can I be researching how legitimate they are? It's one thing to send the law firm itself a list of questions for them to answer, but there's no guarantee they're being truthful. But maybe it would be overkill to look up the company in the Portuguese corporate registries or do other forms of due diligence... I realize I might be being paranoid: should I just let it go, or am I doing enough (or not enough, considering the cost and the sensitive documents I'd be sending them)? So what else should I do?

EDIT: Another idea I will try is to have a quick phone conversation at some point before deciding to go forward with it, just to make sure the number listed on the website works, and that the lawyer sounds trustworthy and is able to communicate clearly.",,False,self,t5_2r5hw,1367177490.0,,,True,t3_1da8r8,http://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/1da8r8/how_to_minimize_chances_of_getting_scammed/,

Definitely would like something related to my degrees, but I'm down for anything really, though preferably related to government or international bodies.

I had planned to go to graduate school for SE Asian Studies, hoped to do research in Thailand and Laos. But the director basically said I was not qualified (I also thought she was a huge elitist, but whatever). I have not heard back from them but I've decided to not go to graduate school.
