What.The.Fuck. Literally smelled like compost. It took everything that's bad about tabasco and everything bad about cheap whisky and multiplied it into one gag-fest of a bottle. One ounce into a full can of pepsi ruined the pepsi. There are no words to explain how bad it was.

This is not the fault of the gifter - they had no idea.

**TL;DR;**

**I go to the LCBO, random store (not sure if it's where the bottle came from), no receipt, open bottle, no idea of the cost of the bottle (hadn't googled it then) and explain how absolutely terrible the taste was. They told me I could get an exchange, so I got an exhange bottle (Beefeater, as I was in the mood for Gin&amp;Tonics) and was off.**

All they needed was my number, addres, name, etc, I assume so people don't abuse the system.

If liquor stores were independent, I can't imagine it would be this easy. Since they have a monopoly in Ontario, it's impossible for me to have bought the bottle anywhere else, right?

The ATVs bugger off, like they've been startled.

The next morning, I walk down that trail, to find that they were pulling apart the log fence along the trail, so they could cross onto my land. Jerks.

I think about how to repair the fence, and visit that spot again the next morning. This time I find a dead deer there. WTF?

The drivers had wrapped some 1/8"" metal aircraft cable around the fence logs in a loop, with another slip-loop around their ATV hitch. When we startled them, they must have ditched the cable and fled. The deer came along, stuck its head into the hitch loop... and strangled itself. It couldn't escape the loop. It had stripped its fur off in a ring around its neck. What a waste of a deer. It was too warm overnight to harvest the meat, too.

Anyway... if you are the sort who roars around on ATVs, ripping down fences so you can spread your joy even further... well, I justed wanted to say: fuck you.",,False,self,t5_2qsf3,False,,,True,t3_r3skx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/r3skx/why_i_hate_atvers/,

(Understanding, of course, that there are always individual exceptions where a fifth year of high school is necessary.)
  
  
**EDIT:** Based on the responses, it seems that not knowing what to do after high school is a significant factor in wanting to complete a fifth year. Other than saying that a person is too young to be making decisions like this (whether it is or isn't, it doesn't matter because these are the same decisions that students have been making at this age in other jurisdictions for generations), is there something that can be done to help students to make these decisions?

I graduated from high school in 1992 (holy god, I'm getting old) and from what I remember, other than a couple of mandatory 15 minute meetings with a guidance counsellor, I didn't receive any sort of career planning advice. Although I'm sure that if I wanted some I could have sought it out.

How is career planning handled today? Is it still the same passive system that I remember from 20 years ago? And I'm not just interested in those people trying to figure out what they want to take in university. What about students who are headed for college/trade school/apprenticeships or straight into the work-force? Do these students receive any sort of career planning?

WTF rogers? It actually costs you money to crop and convert; why not leave the programming in its original format? Why be such uber-douches? Is your decrepit network so fragile that you have to skeeve-out on discretionary bandwidth? Or is your intention to drive people away from non-pay TV access that you can falsely justify dropping it entirely when the regulatory anuses at the CRTC bow and scrape to your latest demand?

Oh right.  Because you still think you're a monopoly. Netflix and Hulu, among others, would beg to differ.

I am an Ontario teacher and I have a heart. You have asked teachers to go back to volunteering their time for extra-curriculars. Thank you for the lesson in hypocrisy. I will return to volunteering my time when you and your members of parliament return the money that you have earned since October, to the taxpayers of Ontario. 

Your abuse of power is limitless. Your decision to prorogue the legislature was strictly to protect yourself and your minority government’s power from being taken away by the Conservatives and the NDP. 
 
While the legislature has been closed since October, Ontario’s schools have been open. Students across Ontario are coming to school each day and getting a high quality education, as the Education Quality and Accountability Office reported in 2012. Unfortunately, they have not been participating in extra-curriculars. 

You are right, in my heart of heart, I want to restart my social justice club and continue to grow the cricket program that I worked so hard to develop at my school last year. Similarly, there are thousands of dedicated teachers across this province that also want to provide enriching and diverse clubs and sports teams for their students. Instead, we are forced to refrain from doing the things we have done so willingly and whole-heartedly for years because our profession is being so greatly threatened. 

Our basic right to a fair collective agreement has been denied. We are not pulling back on extra-curricular activities because we don’t have hearts. We are pulling back because we want to protect the integrity of the Canadian Labour Code; so that our students can enter a fair and just workforce when it is their time. 

This is not about banking sick days for me, nor is it about the fact that I have not moved up the grid, despite taking courses on my own time and dime to further qualify myself. This is me, fighting to defend the integrity of my profession. 

As a beginning teacher, I have many years left in a profession that I love. I work with an incredible group of highly educated and highly dedicated professionals. I would like to continue to work among teachers that value their role in society and work each day to provide our bright and eager students with a high quality education. However, more and more teachers I know are taking on second jobs and feeling under-appreciated and disenfranchised. 

I came to Ontario after working in Alberta and Quebec because of the stellar reputation of the Ontario education system. In my 3 years of working here as a teacher, I have learned from my colleagues, coaches and administrators. I have grown as a teacher by being surrounded by highly qualified professionals. Your actions are jeopardizing this for me and for all future teachers in Ontario. Your actions have demonstrated that the Ontario government does not value the contribution teachers make to this province each day. Your actions could potentially dissuade countless educated individuals from following their “hearts” and choosing teaching as a profession because of the lack of respect you and your government has shown to it. I will continue providing my students with a rich, engaging, student-centered learning environment. I will continue working in this profession that I so love. I will continue doing this because it is what is in my heart.

This is a huge upset, I was a ranger myself and I am sure some of your redditors may have been one, or know someone who has been one.

We need to let our premier know that this is not okay. If anyone can send letters, it will be greatly appreciated. Pass this message on to any rangers you know, especially if they are not super computer savvy  or just don't go on the internet a lot. 

I understand this is a longshot, but awareness and mass public outreach may be the only way to get this enough attention.

Before I came along there was a family of 4 who did my job, however I was hired alone with no conditions and promise of a 2 bedroom apartment, plus benefits and decent pay. 

I moved in, and turns out the apartment is a 1 bedroom, I get no benefits, my pay is half of what the old super used to make, and the list of my work duties keeps getting ""revisions and add ons"" despite me pointing out that i'm only one quarter of their old staff. 

My property manager is here for an hour a week and does nothing, and makes me handle the day to day. I'm essentially the only staff. I am the super on call 24/7 (without extra pay), I'm also the cleaner, maintenance man, Repair man, security, landscaper, snow removal man, day to day manager, and gardener among other things. which I think is an extremely unfair workload to put on one man who you only pay 40 hours a week for.  (but it doesn't stop them from complaining if it's not ALL done on time)

I also receive harassment from the condo board about my wife not helping me to complete my work (my wife does not work for them, and her helping me was never discussed before they hired me). 
And they have also complained to me about not cleaning up and working on stat holidays. (they won't pay me extra to work them though)

Anyways, sorry for the long post guys n girls, but I'm at my wit's end. I feel like i'm constantly harassed and looked down on, and i would call my conditions and compensation deplorable. I feel a lot of the treatment i have received at work is downright illegal, and i need to know my options. 

Also, if there is another subreddit i can post this to, let me know.

The Ontario government is looking at selling off the ONTC (Ontario Northland Bus Service, Train Services, Telecom services) and up to 1000 jobs could be lost if these services are privatized, including mine. This type of loss in Northern Ontario where jobs are already scarce have a huge impact on the economy up here.

Currently our Union is doing our best to stick around but we could use some extra support from people outside the company, and from all parts of Ontario.

Here are my summaries of the platforms for the three main parties.  I tried to only include the facts from their platforms and not to be bias.  Let me know if think there is a bias, and I will do my best to remove it.  There are a few points that I felt fell into multiple categories, so I've duplicated them and said so in parentheses. Lastly, if I'm missing anything, please let me know so I can add it.

Ultimately, I don't care who you vote for, as long as you **vote** and make an **informed decision** when you do.

Apparently, the insurance act [here](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/regs/english/elaws_regs_900664_e.htm) states explicitly that insurance companies are not to hold insurance lapses against you, and a 1996 amendment bulletin [here](http://www.fsco.gov.on.ca/en/auto/autobulletins/archives/Pages/a-06_97.aspx) states that length of insurance overall cannot be held against you either.

Now, we all know that the longer you're continuously insured, the cheaper your premiums, and we've all heard the stories about the 2 day lapse in coverage that cost the poor sucker hundreds of dollars a year. How is this being allowed? I guess it's maybe a discount, but how is even THAT allowed?

I think what it boils down to is not an issue of social responsibility. It's an issue of the province maximizing its PROFIT. It has a closely controlled alcohol system which nets billions, and a heavily marketed lottery which does likewise.

I've lived in Toronto for the past 15 years and am quite sick of it. I originally grew up in a remote region of the former USSR...so I'm more than accustomed to rural way of life. 

I plan to build a house on that parcel but so far I've had a lot of problems locating any zoning information for that region of the province. The township websites are pretty poor and basically have very little information. 

Some questions for anyone who lives in the North of the province year-round:

How are the internet speeds up there? Telecom infrastructure seems to be pretty poor from what I have found out so far. Internet is crucial for me as I am a redditor and a day trader. 

What do you dislike about living in the north? 

Are you armed? - I think buying some firearms will be a priority for me given the remoteness of the region. 

What is the culture like? Is everyone looking out for one another out there? 

How bureaucratic are the local governments? Will it be difficult to acquire a building permit? Is investment in the region encouraged by building on land, etc?

Of course I understand that those who drink and drive are more than deserving of this kind of treatment. I'm just curious to hear from people who are completing or have completed the program.

If you feel the need to remind me of how dangerous and stupid my actions were, that's perfectly understandable.

The lease we signed said it was all inclusive but when we came to move our stuff in June 1st our Landlord caught us completely off guard by saying that we signed the wrong lease and that we have to pay and set up hydro ourselves and that ""He hopes we honour it"". He told us it was a mistake and the advertisement we responded to said that we had to pay for hydro but gave us a lease for the wrong unit saying we didn't have to. Apparently the lease we signed was for unit ""D"" and our unit is unit ""H"". We really don't have the money to pay for hydro and this changes everything..

EDIT: Thanks for the info so far, guys. 

Sounds like attempting to break a lease is something people do fairly often. Also sounds like it's not terribly difficult, unless you landlord decides to give you a hard time about it. Worst case scenario, you lose your last month's rent deposit and/or you have to find someone to assign your lease to, which could potentially be a pain. Although I feel like my building is actually quite desirable for a lot of people, so I imagine finding an assignee wouldn't be that hard.

Basically, I have no valid photo ID. I had a driver's license when I was younger, but it ended up being suspended because of a speeding ticket, and because it was at a time when my finances were already going down the tube, I couldn't get it back. It expired, and so now I have no driver's license.

My health card, which I am still in possession of, is also expired, which means it's no longer considered valid ID.

I have no passport, as I've never been out of the Country except to the States at a time when a passport wasn't required.

I have no credit cards, since as I mentioned, my finances were terrible several years ago, and until my credit clears up, no company will even consider giving me a card.


So now, when I decided that I should finally get my driver's license back, I paid the fine that was on it (240$ for a speeding ticket and a sticker issue). I was told that I just had to go to the drive test centre and take the test again (I only had my G2, so now I have to start from the beginning). So I got there, and they tell me I need to pay a license reinstatement fee first, which I did, at 150$. All of these locations were willing to use my expired health card as proof of ID.

But then finally when I got to the drive test centre again, I'm not allowed to take the test because I don't have valid ID. I'm pissed off about being jerked around a bit, but whatever. I figured I'd just go and renew my health card.

Nope. Can't renew my health card because I don't have the necessary proof of ID. I even inquired about the new Ontario Photo Card specifically made for people without a driver's license and such. One of the requirements of an Ontario Photo Card? Photo ID!

After I explained the ridiculousness of this to the peron helping me at an MTO location, she handed me a ""Declaration from a Guarantor"" form.

Here is the list of acceptable Guarantors:

Dentist, MD, or Chiropractor
Judge, Justice of the Peace, Police Officer
Lawyer
Mayor
Member of Parliament
Minister of Religion
Notary Public
Optometrist
Pharmacist
Postmaster
Principal or School Teacher
Veterinarian
Federal Penitentiary Warden
Professional Engineer
Professional Accountant
Registered Nurse


I don't know a single person who works in these professions. Yet somehow, this form was given to me by the people at the MTO as the solution to not having Photo ID. And it doesn't help me at all.


So now I'm completely baffled as to how I can get my IDs back.

Anyone have any suggestions? Or know of any solutions? I will be eternally grateful!",,False,self,t5_2qsf3,False,,,True,t3_15chq9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/15chq9/please_help_stuck_in_a_bureaucratic_nightmare/,

 Aggregate mining is a serious for many in Ontario, including myself. My family is threatened with a gravel pit application that seeks to install a pit less than 200m from our front doorstep. This puts our water at risk, lowers our air quality, puts even more dangerous trucks on the road - I've already witnessed one of the two fatal accidents involving a gravel truck and car within a 1km stretch on this road - and more noise. In addition to the shitty environment that follows these pits, we will also be faced with a 30% property value loss. The farm land that they'd be digging up, some of the best farm land in Canada, would be irreparably damaged. Even though they say they 'rehabilitate' the land, it will never again be as productive when it comes to agriculture making these endeavors extremely short-sighted economically.

When we went to fight this pit's application, we were told from the start that there was nothing we could do despite our concerns. Our municipal representatives told us that it was the province's fault. The province told us it was our local representative's fault. Our township cannot afford to represent us since they would have to go to costly Ontario Municipal Board hearings if they voted against re-zoning the land for aggregate. They couldn't afford to go so they had to vote against their best interests - this is not democracy. The Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) is the second tier of the approval process. However, their process only requires that they check the application for completion. They don't take whether or not this is a reasonable spot for a gravel pit into consideration. The MNR has never not approved an aggregate mining site. Local residents are being caught in the crossfire and are nearly hopeless.

Unfortunately, my family isn't the only one dealing with this. It's happening all over the province.

As such, I still get their party emails from time to time. I still keep myself on the list for the lols. I'm not a PC hater by any stretch of the imagination and in fact, I don't dislike Harris. However, this shit pisses me off: not because of the party its from per-se, but because of it's overt petulance, the small mindedness of the message, and the alarmist condescension in the over all tone of the writing. There is no discourse, there are no new ideas being pout forward. Nothing. Just blind partisan attacks. And the thing that pisses me off the most is that they raise some very important issues that get buried under all that partisan bullshit. **Please note, I'm not just ragging on the PC's for doing this. I hate all parties that communicate in such banal partisan rhetoric.** Anyone got any examples of other parties spewing such toxic coolaid? Any other former partisans out there that simply no longer give a shit because of pointless vitriol like this?

&gt;Friend,
&gt;
There are two very different paths forward for our province.
&gt; 
&gt;Down one path lies bigger government, more overspending, and higher taxes.
&gt;
That’s the path the Liberals have taken us down for the past nine years – and they’ve failed to take the action necessary to get us back on track.
&gt; 
Down another path, we can choose less government, less spending, and lower taxes.
&gt;
That’s the path Tim Hudak and the Ontario PC Party want to take our province down.
&gt;
We are the only Party that will proudly stand up for fiscal sanity and job creation. To chart a course toward more jobs and away from overspending, we will build on the success of our Paths to Prosperity white papers in the fall session.
&gt;
On Monday, we’ll release our white paper on health care. It will be based on our belief that we can’t grow our economy, or balance the books, without reforming the delivery of health care – the single largest provincial program expenditure. This means putting patients at the centre of decisions, not bureaucrats.
&gt;
Also coming soon is the final report of the PC Job Creation Task Force – with a focus on removing government barriers to job creation, as well as white papers on reducing the power of public sector unions in running government Ministries and agencies – and a re-think of government’s role in a variety of businesses.
&gt;
Sincerely,
&gt;
The Ontario PC Party
&gt;
P.S. If you haven’t had a chance yet, read more about the bold, conservative ideas Tim Hudak has been putting forward:
&gt;
Affordable Energy
&gt;
Flexible Labour Markets
&gt;
Freeze. Fix. Reduce.

Edit:

Just got this from the Liberals (ya, I'm dipping in both barrels). I'm not commenting on the content of either, just the tone. Look at the difference between the two. 

&gt; ‪
Ontario Liberals are hard at work in the Legislature fighting for progress in the priorities that matter most to Ontario families. Here is what you need to know:
&gt;
• Tomorrow in the Legislature, the Putting Students First Act will reach the final vote — with opposition support, this bill will keep funding in the classroom and keep our school year on track.​
&gt;
• We also need the opposition to step up for a third-reading vote on our Healthy Homes Renovation Tax Credit, which would help our parents and grandparents live healthy and independent lives at home, while also creating more jobs. Ontario families have been waiting for this since the last election while the opposition have been dragging their feet.​
&gt;
• And after nine months, the opposition needs to work with us and pass the Family Caregiver Leave Act, which would provide up to eight weeks of job-protected leave to help hard-working Ontarians care for ailing family members.​
&gt;
• We are determined to deliver on our strong plan for Ontario. Families both expect and deserve that kind of focus — and to make that happen, the opposition parties need to join us and play a constructive role in making the minority Legislature work.  

&gt;
Instead of focusing on these important priorities, today the PCs pushed their divisive agenda of cuts and U.S.-style, for-profit private health care. Their scheme would result in firing nurses and closing hospitals just like Hudak did as junior health minister to Mike Harris, when they fired 6,000 nurses and produced the worst surgical wait times in Canada.
&gt;
The Hudak PCs would cut recklessly and put universal public health care at risk, leading to for-profit, U.S.-style private health care where the wealthiest go to the top of the queue. The Horwath NDP just can't say ""no"" to their union supporters — they won't do what's necessary to control public sector wage costs.
&gt;
Only Ontario Liberals have a plan to balance the budget and protect universal public health care and education while growing the economy and creating jobs for families. We're going to keep our focus where it has always been — moving forward, together.
&gt;
What You Can Do
&gt;
Tweet about making the minority Legislature work:
&gt;
#OLP working on priorities of Ontario families – opposition need to join with us to make minority legislature work #onpoli
&gt;
Hudak PCs back to old ideas – they'd fire nurses who provide care for families &amp; seniors across Ontario #onpoli #PCPO

Economics and Taxation have always been very interesting to me. I've often wondered how certain taxes where instituted, and for what reasons. From a relatively young age, I knew that our tax systems was flawed. Whether through popular culture, or lectures from older generations, it was clear that the people with the most money were able to avoid paying, or lobby to have their taxes reduced. I wanted to know how.

When I was around 17, I found a few loop holes in the tax code which allow people making up to $500,000 a year to pay less than 7% income tax. I was not too surprised, but I did astound several accountants when I showed them my findings.

Anyways, after crunching some numbers, I've figured out if we raised the HST from 13% to 18%, and raised the top income tax rate (above $72,000) from 11% to 15%, we could remove provincial income tax for anyone under $72,000 and we would be roughly revenue neutral. 

For people making under $30,000, there could be a 5% income supplement. Ie. someone make $20,000 would receive $1000 income supplement.

What do you say?

REMOVE PROVINCIAL INCOME TAX IF YOUR ANNUAL INCOME IS LESS THAN $72,000 FOR A 5% INCREASE IN HST?

The finally crossed the border last Wednesday, over by Michigan and spent the night at an old friends' in London Ontario. Then I arrived in Oakville yesterday afternoon, where I've been staying with an old family friend until I find a place to stay on my own. 

I set up a bank account at CIBC, and next step was to get a driver's license and all that which is turning out to be a royal pain in the ass. They need a driving record from me, which I've provided, but since it's not a 'sealed real deal copy' it's not good - thing is they stopped using the sealed/real copies in my home state yeaaars ago, and everybody just prints them online as such... so I need to go through more hoops to get a license. Worst comes to worst I guess I'll just have to take the test to get the 'G' license. 

Anyhow, weather here is nice so far, not as hot as I had feared so far.

------


Mr. David Tilson (Dufferin—Caledon, CPC):  
    Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present a petition signed by a number of people from my riding.
    The petitioners wish to draw the attention of all members of Parliament to the proposed mega-quarry in Melancthon Township in Dufferin County, Ontario. It would be the largest open-pit quarry in Canada at over 900 hectares, or 2,300 acres. The proposed mega-quarry would delve more than 60 metres, or 200 feet, deep, which is well below the water table. The proposed mega-quarry would threaten the headwaters of the Nottawasaga, Grand and Saugeen watershed systems and the Mad, Noisy, Pine and Boyne river sub-watersheds, consequently, detrimentally and permanently affecting the aquifers in the area of the proposed mega-quarry. The proposed mega-quarry would put at risk the drinking water of over one million Canadians. The proposed mega-quarry would threaten freshwater fish species, particularly in the Pine River, and would further harm freshwater fish species and their regeneration affecting Georgian Bay and Lake Huron. The proposed mega-quarry would remove from production some of Ontario's best farmland. The proposed mega-quarry would threaten the Grand and Nottawasaga river watersheds, including various freshwater fish species. The proposed mega-quarry would threaten local flora and fauna, including species at risk like the bobolink, a small endangered blackbird. The proposed mega-quarry would initially see 150 truckloads of aggregates leaving the quarry per hour heading south, and 150 empty truckloads returning to the quarry, and other trucks transporting 52 tonnes of explosives to the quarry per day on local roadways not designed to carry such traffic.
    Based on the proposed mega-quarry application, there are distinct issues relating to the use of water operations based on NAFTA considerations, which may have a very substantially negative financial implication federally and provincially.
    Therefore, the petitioners call upon the Government of Canada to conduct an environmental assessment under the authority of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act on the proposed Highland Companies' mega-quarry development.",,False,self,t5_2qsf3,False,,,True,t3_o4cdd,http://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/o4cdd/dufferincaledon_mp_david_tilson_opposes_megaquary/,

The only thing we have to go on is what they call ""non-identifying information"" as provided by the adoption agency.  Non-identifying information is exactly that-- vague references, no names, nothing that can be used to identify the place or person.  I am hoping with enough research and some educated guesses I can figure out some of the facts.  Since the search starts in Canada (Ontario specifically, where the birth mother was from), I figured I would start here.  I listed all the vague facts we received below in hopes someone who is familar with these areas might be able to provide me with some good guesses as to what the real info might be.  There is a lot of info, so I put my actual questions for you in parens below, hope it's not too confusing.  If anyone has any ideas or research tips in general, I would love to hear them (we've also tried 3 dna services and all the adoption registries and have come up dry).

-My boyfriend's birth mother was born in 1941/1942 in Ontario, Canada and lived in a town bordering the US.  This town was very close to a US military base in Michigan.  

(Which town could this be?  what are the options for military bases, probably air force?)

--Facts about the birth mother: while growing up in Canada, she took lessons in piano, dance and violin.  She attended presbytarian church and sang in the choir.  She graduated high school with honors in Canada (1957-ish?) and worked in an attorney's office (family law focused) for two years before getting married in 1959.

(if I can figure out the town she lived in, I can start looking at high school reunion sites and research the law firm).

-Facts about birth mother's family:  her father was from England before moving to Canada and at was at one time a concert pianinst. I estimate he was likely born sometime between 1900-1920, based on her birthdate in 1942.

(any way to get more info on concert pianists in Canada in the 1930's-ish timeframe?).  

The birth mother's father left the family shortly after her birth and moved to a ""northern central US state"" and operated a wood  business.  The birth mother's mother worked as a crane operator ""during the war"" (did not specify which war).  The birth mother had twin brothers who later married and had children in Canada.

(is it odd that the she worked as a crane operator? Any guesses where this might have been?)

-Facts about birth mother meeting her husband: Sometime in the late 50's to 1960, the birth mother met her future husband while he worked on a US military base near the border of Canada (i believe this was in Michigan). He had just joined the military and worked as a ""heavy equipment operator"".  

(any ideas what ""heavy equipment operator"" is code for?)

They married and lived on the Michigan base, and she had two children while there-- James, born in 1959-60 timeframe and Kevin, born in 1960-61 timeframe. In either 1962 or 1963 they moved to Tyndall AFB in Florida, where by bf was born in 1964 and given up for adoption. 


Edit:  in the late 1950's, how old were most students in Ontario upon graduation from high school?  I am trying to pinpoint the birth mother's graduation year. She was 22 in July 1964 which means she was born in 1941 or 1942. She graduated high school, then worked for a law firm for two years, then married in 1959. What do you all think would be the likely year of graduation?

Two months ago I received a job offer in the form of a contract with a signing bonus after the first thirty days, and the contract did specify 'working days'. It's in the construction service industry (repairs) and even though work wasn't busy at all, being a salary employee I was ready and available anytime and all days, also I was paid full weeks based on the contract's annual salary.

Now that work hasn't picked up at all the company says they'll either terminate my employment or I can accept a wage and job description modification that will see me put from a very generous salary to an hourly rate that would see me making barely enough to live on due to the extreme shortage of hours that would be made available to me.

So my question is, even though in two months I've only physically worked 20 days, I was ready and available, like a salary worker should be, and in my opinion the company has agreed they were 'working days' simply by paying me for them....so do they owe me my thirty day bonus?

Any opinions would be welcome, I'm supposed to give them my decision this morning on weather or not i'll accept the modified job offer (which I won't) but I am going to ask they square up on the bonus money which would have been owed a couple weeks ago before we move forward with their secondary offer.
Thanks for any and all thoughts guys and girls, I've never been in a labour dispute type situation before and could use the guidance.

I've been playing with the style sheet and some graphics to try to make this place a little prettier and maybe more user friendly. 

I'd really like to know what the community thinks about the changes. What's good, what could be improved, etc.

For now I've selected a Creative Commons image that I think most Ontarians are familiar with in the month of March.  I want to ask what everyone thinks of the idea of having a contest for a month header image. For each month we could have community submissions of images and the one with the most upvotes would be used as the header for the remained of that month. My idea is that the images would show or represent something about that month. I think it will give us something interesting to look at each month and an opportunity to showcase some of the artistic talent of our community and the culture of our province. If there is enough interest in this idea, the first contest could be held at the beginning of April. Please feel free to discuss how we should run the contest in the comments.

On a more technical note, I've also been trying to develop a menu system to show a list of all the City and Region subreddits as well as the College and University subreddits at the top. I am not very experienced with css or reddit stylesheets and I am having a bit of trouble making it behave the way I would like. [This is the tutorial](http://www.reddit.com/r/CSSTutorials/comments/mwpw8/tutorial_sticky_dropdown_menu/) that I have been following but I am unable to make it display two different menus. If you are good with css and/or have experience working with reddit's stylesheet, I would appreciate your assistance. **Edit: Good news everyone, I've it working now!**

Thanks for reading and keep the great posts coming!

**TL DR**

1. New look, you like?
* Monthly contest for header image, good idea?
* CSS is hard, can you help?

Question on employment law in Ontario ,zombifiednation,19,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/18q075/employer_screwing_me_out_of_pay_question_on/,"So I seem to have run into an issue with my current employer, and I thought maybe Reddit would have some insight. I've been working in a mail room for the last year and a half or so, and since I've been there my boss has been employing an interesting scheme when it comes to overtime. If an employee has to stay late, she doesn't pay them for it, however gives it to them in ""time owed"". As well if an employee has to leave early, she doesn't dock them pay however that employer then owes her time. There is nothing put down in writing, nor any record-keeping of this. 

I had a bit of verbal sparring with my supervisor on Friday, where she asked me at the end of the day to stay late as I ""owed her time"". I informed her that I had an appointment a half hour after my scheduled shift end and wouldn't be able to stay late. This didn't go over well, and told me that there would be repercussions for this. 

I was relating this story to a friend of mine and he told me that this is actually contrary to employment law, and specifically the Employment Standards Act. He was unable to elaborate on this, and so far I haven't had much luck actually finding a specific section of the act that related to compensation for work / pay. So anyone have any insight into this? Is this allowed? I can see some serious liability issues for my company if she's not reporting time sheets accurately, and reporting us as working if we aren't actually there.

Today was my first day of work, which of course I'm very happy about! I work from 7-3, so I had enough time to get to my OW office before closing and met my new worker for the first time. Unfortunately, I'm not at all impressed by how our meeting went. 

There is an incentive bonus for people who secure full-time jobs, but she doesn't want to give it to me. Her stated reason is that I received the transport allowance while I was on OW, even though it is specifically for people who are doing job searching. She say that she ""doesn't feel"" I should get it, because it would mean I would get over a thousand dollars this month in total. 

This is a complete non sequitur, and I'm absolutely sure that there's no rule or reg that instructs her to make such an arbitrary decision. When I pressed for specifics, she just kept repeating that I already received ""my maximum allowable for the month, so you SHOULDN'T get more"". How can you NOT end up getting more than a thousand on a month when you have won a full-time job? 

There's no way that they have this kind of discretionary power, is there? I can't imagine that she is supposed to be able to overrule whomever authored the work-incentive bonus on the basis of ""I feel"" and ""shouldn't"". There's clearly no rule to the effect that I don't qualify and this decision was disturbingly arbitrary, as well as being a slap in the face after I worked so hard to complete the apprenticeship and thought that this bonus would help tide me over until my first pay. Her decision seemed based on nothing more than personal dislike, to be honest, though I have no idea why someone who I met for the first time should dislike me. 

She underlined the fact that she has no rule or reg to justify herself with by saying that she would discuss it with another worker and have a decision by tomorrow. If she was just following the rules, no discussion would be necessary or productive. 

Gee, I wonder what decision she'll come to tomorrow... 

To add insult to injury, she refuses to contact me by email. She wanted me to call her tomorrow during working hours, but this is completely impractical because my job requires wearing a hazmat suit which would make it a prolonged ordeal to get out of containment and then to get to a phone. 

I asked her to email me instead, since I have no cell phone at the moment due to non-payment during these lean months, but she simply won't do it. She instead told me to go to a payphone at lunch and keep trying until I get either her or her assistant. 

I'm supposed to stand there and just keep trying because she doesn't want to bother writing an email that could be a single sentence long? I can't be the only client who compensated for the ridiculously low budgets for rent and food by dropping any expense they could, so I have a feeling that a worker is obliged to email if the client needs it. 

This person is completely unfit to be working with clients, to be blunt, but can she get away with this? I plan to land there tomorrow and respond to her inevitable refusal of my bonus by calling for a supervisor, but is there anything else that I should know about my rights here? Can they simply refuse my bonus on a whim like this? 

I hope that the supervisor over-rules this arbitrary decision, but is there anything I can do if he or she decides to just support a colleague? One idea I just had is to demand to get her decision-making process in writing to see if the possibility of having to explain herself later to an authority suddenly changes her opinion.

Thank you for any insight. ",,False,self,t5_2qsf3,False,,,True,t3_tqv65,http://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/tqv65/can_my_ow_worker_get_away_with_this/,

It is a dream of mine and a wish of my life long best friend that I be able to officiate her future wedding. Now, she will not be getting married anytime in the near future (not in the next 5 years at least), but I figure that it is best for me to start looking around and inquiring on how to become a legal wedding officiate (I believe that is what it is called, please correct me if I am wrong) sooner rather than later.

From my Google-ing it seems that for me to be able to legally officiate a wedding in the province of Ontario (where the wedding is most likely going to take place) I will need to become a judge, a justice of the peace, or a municipal clerk, or become an ordained minister of a Church/religious group which the government has deemed legitimate (thus getting ordained online will not work). [Source](http://www.ontario.ca/government/who-can-perform-marriages)

To begin I do not have a desire or the time to become a judge or a justice of the peace, and a job as a municipal clerk does not fall into my future career plans for myself. Secondly I do not intend on participating in the Catholic Church (of which I am technically apart of against my will) enough to become an ordained minister, nor can I join any other of the religions that the government accepts as I have no belief in them. I have submitted an inquiry to the government of Ontario for more information on how to become a legal wedding officiate, but I am expecting that they simply respond with the same information which I have found myself. 

Do any of you have experience with becoming a legal wedding officiate and performing the marriage ceremony for your friends and/or family? Is there anyway around these regulations on who can perform legal marriage ceremonies?

Thank you in advance.

My wife and I are heading to Ontario for a month this summer. We are both very keen about getting in a canoe for a few days and doing a river trip by canoe. We will be flying in from overseas so we were hoping to find a company that offers affordable 'all-in' rentals for a canoe/food (or food vessels). We can bring a tent/sleeping bags.

I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions? I would really appreciate it. Googling seems to always bring me to cabin rentals and the like.

I miss you, Ontario!

***EDIT***
Wow, I can't believe the response. Every single one of these suggestions looks right on the money. A couple of them were especially well suited for what we're looking for and we'll make a choice in the coming months. Thanks you guys - I hope to see some of you out on the lakes this summer.

However, there was so timing issues and no deposit was given but the letter was signed by both parties.

He didn't want to give us the deposit until both parties signed the letter, once we signed the letter...he didn't want to pick up the letter or return any phone calls.

He also recommended us his ""friend"" to use him as our lawyer but we didn't like him so we got our own lawyer.

Anyways, the deal was suppose to close soon however after 2 weeks of no phone calls or emails...our lawyer got in contact with him and he was informed that the seller was not going to go ahead with the deal.

My lawyer says that this is legal since no money exchanged hands and the law says that what he did might be unethical but also legal since no deposit was given to us.

A few questions:

I am currently in the process of reading up on this but if anyone has any experience on this or reading material, it would be great.

Despite being rather handy with computers, I refuse to do anything crazy for revenge like shutting down his site because it's illegal. So please no advice of that kind!

Is there anything I can do? I feel like what he did is hugely unethical despite being legal. 

Can someone just give me some advice?

Where is the boundary? Educate me.

Edit: I guess I am looking for someplace where there isn't the city ""pace of life,"" where people go when they want to live somewhere a bit more rural, a place where the rhythm is not based on the city commute.  When I went to Belfountain, it seemed to have it's own pace and we liked it quite a bit, but in Barrie, it seemed to be a bit more city-oriented, though that might be the fact that it is bigger.

2nd Edit: Thanks for all the recommendations everyone! Looks like I have some exploring to do.

[x-post in r/Canada],LeafFan13,26,15,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/r5the/help_this_family_stay_in_canada_they_have_lived/,"This is ridiculous. This family has been living in Hamilton, Ontario for 9 years and are now being asked to leave due to their son being autistic. The Canadian government says that their son, Taehoon, represents a potential burden on social and health care. This is a ridiculous statement as Taehoon's condition does not require medical care by the government of Canada.

The family is a big part of the community as the father, Sungsoo Kim, and mother, Sunmi Kim, volunteer regularly at St. Peter Yu Roman Catholic Church in Hamilton.

[Please look over this petition and sign it if feel that this is wrong and to help the family stay in Hamilton.](http://www.gopetition.com/petitions/taehoon.html)

Although I do not know the family personally, I feel that this is a poor representation of what Canada stands for. We pride ourselves on being an accepting and caring nation, yet our government kicks people out who have become part of the community and have been paying taxes for near a decade over a concern that is nonexistent.

[x-post from r/meetup] ",Tmcn,15,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/os2qc/thinking_of_not_one_but_two_meetups_for_southern/,"First off, I am dying to get a huge meetup going in Ontario. I love the idea of having a bunch of people who don't really know each other (but probs have lots in common) come together to hang out. I have two ideas that I want to throw your way, and try to get rolling. 

~~First idea: This idea is a little less likely to actually happen but whatever. If enough people are interested and committed, I want to organize a meetup where we book out some place and basically have a party. It could be a club, some rental hall, a dark large empty room, You know. I would want it to be sometime in the next two months. I am thinking either in the Niagara Region or Toronto. Thing is with this one, we would need lots of people for it to become cost effective. SO yea. Maybe, maybe not.~~ 

Second idea: This one is a little more practical. Basically when spring shows it's beautiful face, we all travel to downtown Toronto, go to a nice park (ie. Queen's park, Nathan Phillips, places like that) and have a huge picnic. It wouldn't cost a whole lot, GO transit is pretty cheap, and you could just bring your own food. It would give us all a nice chance to leave our dark rooms to see the outside world, and maybe meet some cool people. Who knows!? Anyways, I really want to do this. SO if you guys and girls are interested, comment?

~~**EDIT: Idea! Center Island anyone?**~~ 

**Edit 2: People really seem interested in Trinity Bellwoods Park thoughts?** 


**EDIT 3: Go to and subscribe to www.reddit.com/r/GTAPICNIC so that I can deliver information more easily and have a rough estimate of numbers!**

The only exception seems to be for Wine, with small independent shops selling it near the entrances of larger stores.

* For liquor, you have to go to the local LCBO (Liquor Control Board of Ontario) store, which even on late nights close 4 hours before the bars do. Some evenings they close as early as 5:00.

* Beer is sold at a separate (and privately owned) store by the name of the Beer Store.  This is the ONLY private retailer licensed to sell beer ('though you can get six packs and stuff from the aforementioned LCBO).  Because of this monopoly, kegs start at around $250. You can sort of get around this with U-Brew places but they technically can't sell you anything you didn't help make yourself.

My major issue with this system is that we now lack consumer voting power when it comes to what types of beverages we can buy.  If liquor were to be sold at more locations, products would start to be more competitive and smaller companies could stand a fighting chance.  Currently, if the LCBO doesn't pick it, the consumer can't buy it.

Anyone with similar experiences ie, having a relatively fast MRI or CT appt despite provincial wait times in excess of a few months?


Edit:  Thanks.  With this info I feel like I can make it to mid June and not worry so much.  I could ask my Dr. but by the time I get an appt with him it'll be pretty close to my MRI appt anyway.

A group of my friends and I from Detroit are looking to do some camping in Ontario for Memorial Day weekend (May 25-28). It's been pretty hard to find places on the internet, so was hoping some of you maybe had some advice stemming from personal experience or recommendations.

Here's what we're looking for:

1) Not too far from Detroit. We're looking at maybe 5-6 hours driving time. I've been using an imaginary line from Toronto to Tobermory for the edge of my search, but if it's a little farther than that, it likely won't be a problem.

2) Close proximity to something outdoorsy to do. Canoeing is our main go-to but we're open to other ideas as well. I tried to convince my friends to hike part of the Bruce Trail but no one seemed interested in that idea. We've done whitewater and canoeing in the past. Drunk activities are even better.

3) Somewhere where drinking isn't necessarily frowned upon. We're pushing close to 30 for most of us so we're not going to get too crazy, but will probably be looking to do some heavier drinking than a family site may allow. Any place with ""adult"" camping would be great. A bar on site or within walking/biking distance would also be a plus!

4) Dogs being allowed would be a plus but isn't absolutely necessary.

Last Friday, I encountered what seemed to me to be a rather gross impingement of my rights as an elector while voting at the Advance Poll.   

The voting process is simple: an elector signs into the poll, is handed a ballot by the Deputy Returning Officer (DRO), goes to the voting screen, hands the ballot to the Tabulator Deputy Returning Officer (TDRO), who puts it into the vote tabulating machine [Dominion Voting](http://www.dominionvoting.com/) .  On that day, it all appeared to run smoothly, until I casted my ballot which was undervoted (blank).  The machine alerted the TDRO to this fact, who explained to me that he had to ask (by the book) if that were the way I truly intended to vote, or if it were a mistake.  

Having burnt a few ballots at previous elections, I was surprised by this process and later declined my vote under protest.  I obtained from the DRO a copy of the Election Act, and asked her to note in the Poll Record that the Vote Tabulator was contrary to electoral law.  I do not know if she actually did it.  

As described by Section 42 (Voter Privacy) of the Elections Act, to ensure the secrecy of proceedings the following must be followed (irrelevant subsections omitted):

**Interference with electors**

(3)  No person shall attempt to obtain at a polling place information as to the candidate for whom an elector is about to vote or interfere or attempt to interfere with an elector in a polling place. R.S.O. 1990, c. E.6, s. 42 (3).

**Elector not to display ballot**

(4)  Subject to sections 14 and 55, an elector shall not display his or her ballot to any person so as to indicate how the elector has voted. R.S.O. 1990, c. E.6, s. 42 (4).

**Inducing elector to display ballot**

(5)  No person shall, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce an elector to display his or her ballot to any person so as to indicate how the elector has voted. R.S.O. 1990, c. E.6, s. 42 (5).

**Communicating information as to how elector is voting**

(6)  No person shall communicate any information obtained at a polling place as to the candidate for whom an elector is about to vote or has voted or whether the elector declined to vote. R.S.O. 1990, c. E.6, s. 42 (6).

**No person compellable to disclose vote**

(7)  In any legal proceedings no person may be compelled to state for whom he or she voted or whether he or she marked his or her ballot or not. R.S.O. 1990, c. E.6, s. 42 (7).

Full copy of the Election Act:
[Election Act](http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90e06_e.htm#BK99)

Compare this to the directive issued by the Chief Electoral Officer Greg Essensa found here:  

[Directive from the CEO](http://www.elections.on.ca/NR/rdonlyres/2E497994-1D02-45BB-BFB4-477292804BF9/5249/TabulatorDirectiveCEOApproved.pdf)

The section of concern is: 

**Rejected, Unmarked, Misread, or Ambiguously Marked Ballots** 

12. (1) When a ballot marked as described in rules 10 and 11 has been returned by the vote tabulator because it is a rejected ballot, an unmarked ballot, a misread ballot, or an ambiguously marked ballot: 

1. The tabulator deputy returning officer shall advise the waiting elector and ask the elector if he or she wishes to return that ballot and receive another ballot. 

2. If the elector wishes to receive another ballot, 
i. the original ballot shall be returned to the deputy returning officer or special ballot officer, 
ii. the deputy returning officer or special ballot officer shall mark the original ballot ""cancelled"", place it in the cancelled ballot envelope, and give another ballot to the elector, and, 
iii. the deputy returning officer or special ballot officer shall instruct the elector to mark another ballot in accordance with the instructions. 

3. If the elector’s ballot was a rejected ballot or an unmarked ballot and the elector does not wish to receive another ballot, the tabulator deputy returning officer shall deposit the ballot into the vote tabulator. - 9 – 

4. If the elector’s ballot was a misread ballot or an ambiguously marked ballot and the elector does not wish to receive another ballot, the ballot shall be dealt with in the manner prescribed in rule 14(4). 

(2) When a ballot marked as described in rules 10 and 11 is returned by the vote tabulator and the elector has left the polling place, the ballot shall be dealt with by the tabulator deputy returning officer in the manner prescribed in rules 14(2) to (4).

Has anybody else encountered this problem as well?  

Would you like to?

I understand that the Vote Tabulator is also being used for Special Ballots [Special Ballot](http://wemakevotingeasy.ca/en/special-ballots.aspx) [Location of Special Ballot Offices](http://fyed.elections.on.ca/fyed/en/form_page_en.jsp) , but am unsure about Polling Day on the 6th.  They are open from 10:00 – 20:00 tomorrow.(EDIT: 10:00-18:00 on the final day)  I am ignorant of the nuances of provincial electoral law, but the process does appear to contradict voter privacy.   If you have nothing to do (and never intended to vote or are undecided) head over to your local Returning/Satellite Office and cast a blank ballot into the machine.  When the TDRO asks you if that is how you wish to vote, cite section 42 (3,4,5,6) of the Election Act, and either decline your vote under protest, or do anything else you can think of.  Just remember to be polite to the poll workers; they only follow the manual given to them.


Directive: http://www.elections.on.ca/NR/rdonlyres/2E497994-1D02-45BB-BFB4-477292804BF9/5249/TabulatorDirectiveCEOApproved.pdf

Election Act: http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90e06_e.htm#BK99

**Addendum**

I'll admit that it's pretty much the most uninspired democratic call to arms in history. No bugle, no stirring songs, no marches through the city streets. We all have a right to an anonymous vote though, so I thought I would put this out there. I think it also needs a TL;DR.

**TL;DR**

**Go troll Elections Ontario tomorrow by casting a blank vote through the tabulating machine, then protest the fact that your vote is not secret.**

The machine reads the ballot, then states a message on its screen that the vote is either unmarked, overvoted, ambiguous or invalid. The TDRO is then required to ask the elector if that is how they actually chose to vote, and if not, to correct it. The machine will store an over/undervoted ballot once they are manually cast by the TDRO, and will print these onto the display tape. I understand that I was the only person to vote this way at my poll.

By blank ballot I mean not putting a mark inside the Candidate's circle.

The machine makes a distinction between candidates, as it will print out a voting results tally of each candidate at the end of the election to determine the winner of the advance poll and special ballot.

Seems like a bad way to interpret and set law.

Here are the parks that I have seen openings for:

- Sandbanks

- Mikisew

- Killbear

- Silver Lake

- Sturgeon Bay

- Presquile 

- Balsam Lake

I live in Toronto, so I was also hoping to drive under 5 hours to the park.

-Repealing the definition of ""distress"", which is the legal definition on which animal abuse charges is based.

-Removing all penalties for animal abuse violations.

-Stripping the OSPCA of all enforcement powers and abolishing the Animal Care Review Board (which currently hears appeals from people whose animals have been removed by the OSPCA).

-Stopping the OSPCA from removing animals from abusive situations.

-Taking away the OSPCA's authority to order owners to take proper steps to care for their pets (e.g. ordering an owner to provide water, appropriate shelter or veterinary care).

-Removing the legal obligation of veterinarians to report animal abuse.

-The only recourse animals would have would be the Criminal Code of Canada, which is far more difficult to enforce and would be enforced only by police. Concerns include whether all police officers have sufficient specialized knowledge of animal husbandry to recognize distress, whether they have the skills to deal with exotic, dangerous or aggressive animals and whether the police service has enough resources to take on this extra role.

-The OSPCA would be forced to keep animals in their care when their owners are charged with animal abuse. Even if these owners are subsequently convicted, the OSPCA would have to pass on the proceeds of the ""sale"" of the abused animals to their former owners.

-The OSPCA would not have the option of putting livestock up for adoption - the law would force them to sell horses, cattle, donkeys, pigs etc. at public auctions only.

This is totally insane, will undo generations of work for animal protection, and will set a very dangerous precedent in North America.

Say for example, I've worked enough hours to accumulate almost 2 weeks of paid vacation. So I've banked nearly 80 hours of vacation time and pay.

Can the business I work for legally tell me when I can or can not use that vacation time?

For example, I wish to use part of my accumulated vacation hours to travel back home to spend Christmas with my family. Employees have been told that, if you wish to leave for the Christmas holidays you must either, quit or transfer to a location in your area and work at a different location over the Christmas break.

There is no location in my area which I could transfer to, yet I still wish to use my vacation time/pay to travel home for Christmas.

Can my employer legally either tell me no, I can not use my vacation hours then so I have to stay and work if i wish to keep my job, or I must quit or be fired to be able to travel home for Christmas.

I will also add that, the place where I currently work, I have been working at the location the longest out of any other employees or management who currently works there.

We (three 30 year-olds Scots) are flying to Toronto in September then flying home 1 week and 6 days later. We have bought the flights but nothing else has been booked.

So far my plan is;

3 nights in Toronto then stopping a night each in

Ottawa – Quebec – Fredericton – Antigonish – Cabot Trail

Which would leave us 5 days to get back to Toronto. I figure we'd spend a couple more days around Nova Scotia then head back to Toronto in bigger jumps via Montreal.

The route out East splits the drive up so that we have enough time to look around once we arrive at places and visits places that look interesting - but I'm happy to make changes. The biggest jump is from Quebec to Fredericton which is about 370 miles.

We are happy to see anything and everything, bustling cities or remote wilderness.

I have a few specific questions;

1)We are considering driving to Ottawa via the Algonquin national park. This would bump the driving up to 6 ½ hours. Is it worth it? Enough to spend a night nearby?

2)Is my plan for driving out East sound? Is there an alternative route I should consider?

3)If you were going to drive back from Nova Scotia to Toronto would you do it over 5 days or less and what stops would you make?

4)We are planning to use Air bnb for accommodation but any suggestions for places to stay (no camping), places to eat and things to do along the way would be very gratefully received.

I haven't gotten a speeding ticket in almost 3 years so I called them to see what was up. Turns out they added someone else's speeding ticket to my record. MTO told me to call the court that handled the case and when I talked to those guys, they were confused since it was a driver from New York. They told me they had no clue what happened and for the following few days I got bounced between the MTO and the court, both sides telling me little bits of information and to contact the other side. Eventually the court told me they would submit the paperwork to get the ticket off my record and that it would be dealt with.

Now fast forward 6 months or so to today. I just pulled up my driver's abstract from the MTO ($12) and it's still showing that ticket. I need to produce the driver's abstract for something and that's why I paid the $12. 

I can't remember which court it was, so I'm trying to get a hold of someone at the MTO (been on hold for a long time now) to get started on this procedure again. Anyone have any experience with something like this? Or any advice?

Hi Ontarians, I'm trying to create a budget and figure out if relocating for a summer job (which I was very excited for) is a viable option for me. The job is a forestry related job in Renfrew County and is through a federal student work program. So money will be tight.

My interviewer and potential boss told me that they used to have a place for summer students close to work but that the government is no longer operating that and I'd have to find somewhere to rent. After a quick search a months rent would be anywhere from $500 to $600. 

I'd like to know how much you folks spend on food and gas in a week or a month if you have that information. I was considering biking to work all summer and was told that they had one student do that but that it was pretty dangerous since you take a highway to get to work. It's about 20 km one way, 30 mins by car and 60 mins by bike.

TLDR; broke ass student would like to know how much people are spending to comfortably (frugally) eat, live, get to work and enjoy summer out east.

Oh and enchant me with tales of fishing, hiking and canoeing. 

Thanks!

Edit: I also heard horror stories about the flies... Are these true?
       Also the reason this job is so appealing for me is because it's a technical job and I'll be able to learn sweet skills that are applicable to my study. That and I only get to accept/decline the summer jobs I'm offered though the program.

The anonymity of being ""just a regular person"" is something that can't be reclaimed once the fact that you're a lottery winner is out.

I've read before about creating a corporation and claiming the winnings under the umbrella of the corporation, via a lawyer. My question is whether that is possible in Ontario?

My initial search on the OLG website only led me to this nugget:

&gt;**7. Must all winners have their names published?**

&gt;The publishing of winners is important in demonstrating the integrity of our lottery games. OLG reserves the right to publish the name, address and photograph of any winner. This is necessary for us to demonstrate that people do win. Winner information is released to the news media and may be used in OLG 's advertising. For every prizewinner there are a number of other players who did not win but have a legitimate desire to know that someone won.

From the looks of it, it's up to their discretion. They may or may not release your name, but it is likely they would.

Can this particular convention be legally circumvented? It would be a shame to win a large sum of money and subsequently lose one's anonymity.

Unrelated: most lottery players probably already know this next nugget, but I figured I should post it regardless (because it's awesome):

&gt;**19. What tax implications are there for lottery winners?**

&gt;Generally, Canadian tax authorities do not consider lottery winnings to be taxable for Canadian tax purposes.

I have a potential job offer from a pretty big organization, and before it even gets to that stage, I need to determine whether I'm willing to make the commute every single workday for the foreseeable future. So here are some of the major points of my dilemma:

* I live in Vaughan and the company is in Milton (I will be travelling **westbound** in the morning)
* I would prefer to avoid paying the toll to use Highway 407, but I will consider it if rush hour is extremely terrible on the 401
* According to Googlemaps, the trip will take an estimated 60 minutes (50 minutes if I take 407)

So Ontario redditors, how have your experiences been on the westbound 401 in the morning? If my estimated travel time is 60 minutes via Googlemaps, how long do you think it would take in actual rush hour traffic? How about on the 407?

Why I'm asking...
My bosses friend called the office in a panic as his wife informed him of the crisis going on at the hospital she works at.
Apparently someone tainted coke/weed/etc with some kind of a wormer medication. This wormer medication is somehow causing bacteria to infest parts of the drug users body forcing hospitals to amputate the infected areas as its the only way to save these people.
They also said that there are 49 cases so far, and several dead are suspected to be linked to the tainted drugs. Its suppose to be on the news soon.

I have onstar, so immediately i was talking with them, they asked if i needed an ambulance, i said ""no but hold on ill check on the other car"", i yelled over to the good Samaritan who got out of his car to check on me then the other car if they were okay, he said yes (but the driver actually ended up getting taken away in an ambulance, im not sure if she was hurt or just in a state of panic due to the original ""yes they are okay"").  

I got charged with careless driving.  The cop said if i fight it they generally go easy on you because ""expecting to pay this ticket is ridiculous""     

So unless some miracle happens my insurance will be going up, I'm looking on the bright side that the careless driving will be dropped or lessened, i don't know how the levels work.

What I propose is a deposit return system for ALL packaged goods.

Go to McDonalds -- Fry cup 10¢ - Big Mac box 10¢ - Medium drink cup 10¢ - Bag 5¢ 

It'd be an extra 35¢ on top of the price of a meal.  


Buy a new TV -- $7 worth of cardboard styrafoam and plastic.


Most people would probably throw it in the garbage because they're not dicks.  

Some people would collect it for the $$.

The way I'd explain it to anyone other than Reddit is - ""church groups and boyscout troops could clean our highways as a fundraiser!""  --  But that really means ""meth addicts will clean our cities and highways for free!""


Imagine a world where a Timmies cup is worth a dime.  Our streets would be spotless.


The best part is:  Most people would still just throw out their garbage, therefore the system would be a money maker.  And it might encourage companies to use less packaging, McDonalds serving meals on ceramic plates.

Please only submit images that either you own, or you have permission to use. We don't want to make anyone angry. 

The winning image will need to be cropped to fit properly so keep that in mind when choosing an image to submit.

-My Dad just purchased a 2008 Honda Civic Dx-g (2 door, manual) today

-I am already listed as a second driver under my mom's car

-I have my G1; getting my G2 in two days


Currently, the insurance company we have is going to default me as the primary driver for the Civic once i get my G2, and will cost about 9000 a year (THATS MORE THAN THE CAR ITSELF)

I wanted to know what the best bet is here; is there a way to have me as a secondary on JUST the civic, while it is under my dad's insurance; or does that mean we have to get rid of one car?

I tried calling my doctor since childhood (since we still live near by) thinking he would accept family members regardless but the receptionist told me the doctor would not be accepting new patients - family or otherwise.

I feel like this calling around is grossly inefficient and getting us nowhere. We just learned in the last week that we are pregnant so finding her a doctor is a little more urgent now.

Does anyone have suggestions for how to find her a family doctor? Is there a generic list we can sign up for or a one-stop-shop phone number we can call? We live in the London area if that helps.

The town was also seen the closure of one of its goldmines, and its paper mill, a shrinking population, several youth suicides, the polluting of our great [lake](http://canadianwood.ca/fr/nouvelles/another-chemical-spill-in-marathon.html) and numerous other events. The closure of the mill and mine has significantly increased the amount of poverty in the community as well as limited the amount of activities available for the youth. 

The marathon Museum is currently participation in the [Aviva](http://www.avivacommunityfund.org/ideas/acf14909) Community Contest and could use your votes.

Link: [1] http://www.nationalcapitalbeerweek.com/homebrewing_competition.asp
This year is the inaugural National Capital Beer Week, August 11th-18th. Finishing with a two day festival in Downtown Ottawa. This celebration of beer in the Canadian Capital Region includes a Homebrewing Competion, formally sanctioned by the BJCP and AHA bodies.
Entries can be submitted from anywhere (obviously it's your entry and responsibility is not passed to the owners for shipping cross border), and I know there's some entries coming in from the West coast of the US.
Seeing as it's about 5 weeks till the entry date this is a great time to get your best brews together!
Any BJCP category except mead and cider (rules are being updated) can be entered. This is because our BJCP judges haven't had enough experience and it wouldn't be fair.
You can enter as many categories as you want, but only one entry per person per category. Full rules and a more detailed description at the above link. Repeated here: [2] http://www.nationalcapitalbeerweek.com/homebrewing_competition.asp

I didn't post this to /r/canada or any other provinces, but if you know anyone that's a homebrewer push them towards the links above.

Here is an email forward I received from my very conservative cousin.  Obviously, some of what is mentioned is true, but I'm sure some of it is blatantly false.  Can you help point these out?  Or maybe I'm wrong and all of the below is true.  That would be helpful to know as well.

I'd like to send him back a list of GOOD things accomplished by the incumbent government.  Can you also help compile a list like that?

The email forward:

&gt;Whoever put this together DID THEIR HOMEWORK. Gets you thinking.

&gt;Don't forget, McGuinty also put the HST Tax on Electricity bills, which are increasing every year, by leaps and bounds. 
 
&gt;PLEASE READ, PASS ON AND REMEMBER NEXT ELECTION....

&gt;Here is what our Premier has done for Ontario in the past seven years. Remember...he had a no tax increase election message/campaign.

&gt;He has increased all the licensing fees from your car to your boat including fishing and hunting.

&gt;He introduced the health care premium (not called a tax) and some couples pay as much as $1,500.00 a year.

&gt;He has put an ECO tax on many containers such as paint cans and window washer fluid.  And people still don't realize it until they see the bill - he kept that one real quiet.

&gt;He put a disposal tax on all electronics.

&gt;He put the disposal tax back on tires.

&gt;And now he has passed the HST tax - the largest tax on the province ever and the only other tax in Ontario that ever came close to this in the past was the health care premium. He passed this bill even though 76% of the people in Ontario were against it.
This HST will provide the Province with an additional THREE BILLION dollars a year.

&gt;Then on July 15th, we all got our S.M.A.R.T. Meters on which we have to pay perpetual rent and will end up doing our laundry in the middle of the night. We are also going to pay big time for air conditioning from now on because when we need it the most it will be  prime time usage.

&gt;Let us not forget the E-health scandal with 1.2 billion dollars wasted and paid out to friends and relatives. What was Mr. McGuinty's answer to this? ?Well, if the people of Ontario don't like it, they can show it in the next election. Nice attitude. This, after he fired the CEO and then gave her a severance package of $300,000 - not bad for only being on the job for seven months.

&gt;And what about the SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR windmill power plant contract that he awarded to KOREA ? One would think there was some place in Canada or North America that could have built these.

&gt;He also closed the emergency rooms in Port Colbourne and Fort Erie because there was not enough money. There have been two deaths since then because by the time they got to St. Catharine's it was too late. But he then awards a hospital in Toronto three million dollars - of course, that was in the riding where there just happens to be a by-election to replace George Smitherman!

&gt;He has taken the richest most prosperous province in Canada down to one of the 'Have-Nots' and, over the past six &amp; one half years, has increased the budget deficit from $5.6 Billion dollars to TWENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. And don’t forget his nice little salary increase of $40,000.00 a year - millions of people in the province don't earn even half of that.

&gt;Have we forgotten all the MP'S who also got a 14% increase? And now that they've had their increases he comes out with a new budget to freeze all provincial employees wages for two years - a bit late don't you think.

&gt;He increased the hydro tax by 10% in April of 2010.
He took the freeze off tuition for students in Ontario, but gives foreign students from China free education - notonly do they not pay, they take up spaces Canadian students could fill! 

&gt;He has increased the tax on liquor and wine by 10% in May of 2010.

&gt;Also, do not forget that Dalton wanted to build a 900MW Gas Fired power plant less than 1km from homes and schools in Oakville. After wasting millions to try and push this through and blaming it all on his policy of defeating NIMBY attitudes, the power plant was suddenly cancelled. By a miracle yet to be properly explained, Ontario suddenly had an energy surplus and no longer needed the plant.
Now he's going to give newcomers a break getting a job by offering potential employers $10,000. What about the rest of us?

&gt;Dalton is a dolt and a fake and needs to go down heaped with shame for a job very badly done. 

&gt;But, Mr. McGuinty will retire with his nice comfortable pension and all his benefits paid.   I hope this gets passed around the province of Ontario and everybody remembers the way we got screwed by Mr. McGuinty and the Liberal party and - remember - not one Liberal MPP had enough guts to vote against any of the above.

&gt;Wake up Ontario!! 
 
&gt;And pensioners have not received a raise in over 18 months!!!!!

Me and my SO came to Canada last year for the first time to visit family. They live in Welland.

We arrived just in time for Canada day so we also got to experience the delights of that! 

We are going back this year for the last two weeks in Aug. We enjoy walking/hiking (preferably not somewhere where we will be eaten by bears). We are wondering is there anywhere reddit highly recommends visiting while we are back there again? Anywhere of particular natural beauty or any tourist bits we may have missed? 

My SO family were brilliant and showed us all they could whilst we were there. We are looking at renting a car so obviously can travel if needs be.

Our original plan was to get married in 2014, but we are realizing now that it may be a bit too long to wait, and certain things in our lives have made having it this year much more feasible.

So here’s what we ask:
  
* It needs to be somewhere between Oshawa and Kingston, Ontario, or no more than an hour or so outside of those cities.
* It should be on a field, or on a farm of some sort.
* Preferably, it should be capable of hosting an outdoor wedding, or have a barn for an indoor one.
* It needs to be on the cheaper end of things. We are students with not a lot of money in our budget.

We are only looking for advice/assistance/referrals to a venue, not money. Have you been to a wedding that could fit this criteria? Please let us know!

We're given two paid 15 minute breaks, and on unpaid 30 minute break (lunch). The workplace has set up the 2nd break so that it is taken at the end of the shift, allowing us to cleanup and leave once we're finished.

According to Ontario Employment Standards Act 2000, employees must be given the 30 minute unpaid break if working more than 8 hours, and do not need to provide any other type of break.

Do I have a case against my agency for not paying me for the last 15 minutes of my shift since it is technically our last paid 15 minute break? After reading the Standards Act I don't think I do anymore since these 15 minute break laws were removed from the Act (I remember seeing documents relating to this a couple years ago, but not 100% sure). However, the permanent full-time (unionized) employees get paid for this time. In addition this paragraph pretty much protects to agency for not paying me:

Employers are required to provide employees with eating periods as described above. Employers do not have to give employees “coffee” breaks or any other kind of break.

Told the landlord in early december about the problem. A week later we had a set time that worked for both of our schedules. He didn't show up, with no explanaition. No email, no phone call. Efforts to contact him failed. Today he dropped by (after 24 hours notice) with the fire dept to check the smoke alarm. My roommate was here but I wasn't. She told me she asked him about the heater and he said, ""Yeah,"" then walked out. (WTF?)
