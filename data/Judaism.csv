Now, that is asking a LOT of people, so I devised a work around. I just make a new account, /u/Shidduch, password is shidduch. Log in, respond here anonymously to this post with whatever you want. And if somebody knows somebody (or is that somebody) who could be a match, respond to that comment using your actual reddit name. Or you can just post as yourself.

Keep an eye out on the thread and the anonymous poster can message the not-anonymous responder.

I live downtown in the East Village, and my synagogue is on 14th street.

All week we were cold, tired of being home before the streets turned to darkened canyons, and shul was 100% closed. But on Friday, I got an email as I sat uptown charging my phone - Kabbalat Shabbat was on!

I walked down the 45 blocks, back to my neighborhood, to the dark and cold shul. They were cooking hot food for after the service, and the mostly elderly members were under blankets. But, after we it candles, we started the psalms and everything started to feel normal.

Around the 4th verse of L'cha Dodi, a light flickered, an the door alam started to beep. Most of us kept singing while the Rabbi ran to look in the hall. Then, all the lights came on!

The cantor kept up the song as we started a hora dance. There were only maybe 25 people there - but everyone was smiling. One woman was crying she was so happy.

Needless to say, we all laughed at this ""miracle"" after we finished the full service under our working lights. While I know it was a coincidence, it was an uplifting end to a very trying week!

I hope everyone else is safe, and my heart goes out to everyone affected by Sandy!

1) No editorializing titles of article submissions. - This is up for discussion.

2) Be polite. That means if somebody has a disagreement with you about fundamental points of religion, you can disagree with them, and even tell them, but don't be a jerk about it. Do not shut down the conversation. 

2.1) I keep on trying to engage non-Orthodox Jews of Reddit. Seen [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jewish/comments/we84t/followup_question/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/exjew/comments/wuexe/come_to_rjudaism_maybe/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/exjew/comments/x2qxe/so_much_for_wanting_to_comment_on_rjudaism/). This is in addition to multiple messages I have gotten personally and as mod, from people who left because of this. Just because some people don't agree that this is a problem, does not make it less of a problem.  Non-Orthodox Jews are feeling shut down, and some times they are right, some times they are wrong. This is an extension of rule two. Be polite. The downvote button IS NOT a ""I disagree"" button. I might just remove it again, and for more than a day.

To people I try and engage, this is a two way street. Submit content, comments and vote if you want to have a say. I don't think half of the subreddit is orthodox. This should not be a problem.

Please upvote this self post for which I receive no karma so that all can see.

Thank you all.

I am writing this compelled by a deep feelings of inward necessity which I feel must be addressed.  For a while now I have become concerned with truth. Throughout my studies, throughout my life, I have yearned for truth, for understanding, and for fulfillment. Recently, I have been researching Judaism. Throughout my research I have discovered the most dedicated, most rational, most benevolent human beings I have ever encountered. By this I mean, as a whole, the Jewish people. No people has ever been as reasonable and as wholesome to me than the Jews. I have read the Torah, I have read Rashi and studied as much as I can about the Sages. The only conclusion I can reach is that you are God's chosen people. No one has endured as much hardship and still maintained their culture as beautifully as you have. As I read of the exiles and the persecuted history I find myself brought to weeping alone at your plight. You are so admirable, so courageous, that I am brought to my knees. Recently, a picture surfaced depicting a few Jews seemingly taunting a Muslim woman after displacing her from her home. Many redditors were quick to judge and displayed outright contempt against Jews in various anti-semitic and prejudiced fashion. I, however, did my research, and uncovered that the photo in question was indeed a fabrication. A distortion of the truth intended to paint jews in a negative light. I was appalled at the seemingly, and supposedly virtuous and truthful nature of the people of reddit, as they continued to berate and demonize the Jews as evil and contemptible, even comparing them to the Germans of the Nazi party. Since this time, my life has been shaken, and I have realized that with the status of ""the chosen people"" comes severe prejudice and hate by others. As a final note, though, I just want to say I love you all. You are so kind, so truthful, and so beautiful. May you be blessed by God for eternity. I have a deep yearning in my soul to be Jewish now, and I hope to one day join you in the streets of Jerusalem to celebrate Purim or any other of your beautiful holidays. May God ever be in your hearts and souls, and may everything you do be turned to gold. Stay strong, and do not crumble due to the hate around you.

He boarded the train and found an empty seat. At the next stop, a young man got on and sat next to him. The scholar looked at the young man and he thought: This fellow doesn't look like a peasant, so if he is no peasant he probably comes from this district. If he comes from this district, then he must be Jewish because this is, after all, a Jewish district.

But on the other hand, since he is a Jew, where could he be going? I'm the only Jew in our district that has permission to travel to Moscow.
Ahhh, wait! Just outside Moscow there is a little village called Samvet, and Jews don't need special permission to go to Samvet. But why would he travel to Samvet? He is surely going to visit one of the Jewish families there. But how many Jewish families are there in Samvet? Aha, only two - the Bernsteins and the Steinbergs. But since the Bernsteins are a terrible family, so such a nice looking fellow like him, he must be visiting the Steinbergs.

 But why is he going to the Steinbergs in Samvet? The Steinbergs have only daughters, two of them, so maybe he's their son-in-law. But if he is, then which daughter did he marry? They say that Sarah Steinberg married a nice lawyer from Budapest, and Esther married a businessman from Zhitomer, so it must be Sarah's husband. Which means that his name is Alexander Cohen, if I'm not mistaken.
But if he came from Budapest, with all the anti-Semitism they have there, he must have changed his name.  What's the Hungarian equivalent of Cohen? It is Kovacs. But since they allowed him to change his name, he must have special status to change it. What could it be? Must be a doctorate from the University.  Nothing less would do.

At this point, therefore, the scholar of Talmud turns to the young man and says, ""Excuse me.  Do you mind if I open the window, Dr. Kovacs?""

""Not at all,"" answered the startled co-passenger.

""But how is it that you know my name?""

""Ahhh,"" replied the Talmudist, ""It was obvious.""",,False,self,t5_2qi67,False,,,True,t3_o8x8r,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/o8x8r/talmudic_logic_a_joke/,

She calls us pretty consistently for food from a Southern restaurant. She always places an order for the same dish, and on the side she requests collard greens. Today I was placing her order for her, and I realized that the menu had been updated to say that the collard greens are cooked with pork. 

My familiarity with kosher restrictions and practices is pretty limited, and I understand that it may not be something that bothers everyone, but I still feel I should at least mention it. I know it's a dish that she's ordered before quite a bit, and I'm trying to decide the best action to take.

Should I tell her the next time she orders? Is it the kind of thing that wouldn't be worth worrying about, since it doesn't have any actual meat in it? Should I mention that it's been this way for a while, or just mention it as a new change? I'm not sure if this is a really delicate matter, or if I'm overly bothered. 

Sorry if I sound silly for getting worked up or worse, like I'm not taking this seriously enough.

I understand that it may be surprising, when you find out one of your friends or acquaintances was not born Jewish. It is only natural that you are curious as to how and why he or she became Jewish. What I ask is that, before asking the question, ""why did you become Jewish,"" you count to ten, take a deep breath, and decide not to ask that question at all.

I know there are some converts who love explaining why they converted and who have no problem answering that question. But we are not *all* like that, and whether we choose to publicly trumpet our achievement in joining the Jewish people or whether we choose to keep that achievement to ourselves, other Jews should respect our choice. Conversion is so deeply personal a process that one's motivation for it usually cannot be easily or glibly expressed, and putting someone on the spot to explain something that personal is incredibly insensitive.

I know y'all in /r/judaism are a thoughtful bunch, but I was put in this situation again last night, and it felt terrible, so I thought I would make a reminder in a place where some Jews might see it.

There is no maximum for the number of Divrei Torah in a week, but by signing up, you help ensure we have a minimum of one a week instead of having three one week and zero the next.

Second, if you report something, [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FJudaism) as very often without a reason, I just approve it unless it is blatant anti-semitism.  I have had half a dozen things reported in the past two days, all of which I approved.  If you make a case, I am more likely to think about it.

Third, I have decided anything preachy from Jews for Jesus will be banned.  As to what constitutes ""preachy"", that is a case by case basis.  It really has to be saying something along the lines of ""Jesus is right"" or ""Jesus is a Jewish belief"".  I have also added a paragraph explaining why it is not a Jewish belief in the denomination document.

Edit: Fourth - It appears the Rashi link on the sidebar is dead.  Does anybody knows a good website to find Rashi online that is from a non-denominational site?  By policy, nothing on the sidebar is from a denominational site.  Is this a policy that we want to change?

1373301926.0,43,self.Judaism,1hvfhw,Something a rabbi said at Yom Kippur that may help some of you understand less observant movements...,Lereas,51,8,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1hvfhw/something_a_rabbi_said_at_yom_kippur_that_may/,"In light of the recent desire for discussion, I wanted to recount the yom kippur sermon a rabbi gave last year at the synagogue I go to. 

I essentially consider myself humanistic, but there isn't a congregation here so I go to a rather large reform synagogue. I grew up conservative, but I didn't feel like I was getting much out of a lot of it, and my wife grew up reform so we settled on that. 

While I wish I could post the entire sermon, I can't find an archive of it so the best I can do is paraphrase the main bit. 


The rabbi was talking about how, when her mother passed away, she was given all of her mothers cookbooks and recipe boxes. Her mother was a prolific chef, and had probably thousands of recipes, hundreds of which were well known to the family. 

As the rabbi sorted through all of it, she began to find some of the recipes she knew and love. Some of them were simply clippings from a magazine or coppied out of a book. Others were clipped, but notes had been written in the margin, and some lines were crossed out or amounts altered. 

Still others were hand written recipes written by her great grandmother, and two other sets of handwriting (her grandmother and mother) had made their own edits. Tallow became shortening became margarine and then butter. Amounts changed. Spices changed. Whole parts of the recipe were removed or added. 

And the rabbi began to wonder: At what point does it stay ""the family recipe"" and when does it become something else? If you make great Great Grandma's kugel the way that it was written by great great grandma, it will taste nothing like the dish your mother made when she made ""great great grandma's kugel"" because great grandma and grandma and mom all made little changes. 

But do you WANT to make the kugel the original way? Maybe you try it and you like it, but you have no connection to it. It's not the great great grandma's kugel that YOU know and love. 

Contrawise, maybe you never really loved Nana's brisket, but you find that she changed the recipe to use 3x as many onions as are called for. You make it the original way, and find you actually like it much better that way. Is it still Nana's brisket, or is it yours? Do you have the RIGHT to change Nana's brisket?


The rabbi decided, she said, that what is important are those things that we find to be important. Over time and the generations, we each shape the things we pass on a little bit. Even though some people may feel that they have no right to change things, it happens naturally to adapt our ""recipes"" to what is best at the time. 



Now, before the ""But the torah is the original exact recipes and we have no right to change it!"" argument: I get that's your viewpoint. Translations to English are certainly varied. I don't actually know the answer, but are some torahs different than others or are they all absolutely and completely identical? 

Also, one other point to remember: while (by my understanding) orthodox holds the opinion that the torah is true to the letter and was given directly by the divine, this is not the opinion held by most other movements. Actual beliefs vary, but my general feeling is that most people believe that some of the events in the Torah happened, some didn't, and some happened but not quite exactly how they're described. The Torah is (by many acounts) a book of laws written (possibly with divine influence) to help people be more moral, just, ethical, and all of the other positive words about human behavior. 

Must we, then, follow every single rule in it to the letter when there are so many interpretations of what it means exactly even within the most orthodox circles? 

Or perhaps we should use it as a recipe guidelines, and if we find it needs just a little bit more salt, we can add a note in the margin?",,False,self,t5_2qi67,False,,,True,t3_1hvfhw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1hvfhw/something_a_rabbi_said_at_yom_kippur_that_may/,

So, a survey recently popped up in a couple of subreddits on the subject of religion but people weren't too happy with the questions. I've attempted to compose a more versatile and inclusive survey. 

This survey has been created as an attempt to compile information on the various religious beliefs, and lack thereof, on Reddit. Please answer all questions with sincerity and honesty. Please note, this is not a quick ""check one and done"" survey and may take a little while to complete. Also, I have NOT included topics like abortion and homosexuality for a reason. Please do not bring them up in this survey's topic. We are collecting opinions on spirituality, not attempting to fire up yet another debate.

Please upvote this survey so that more data can be collected. This is a self post, so I'm not getting any karma. But we get the best results when many, many people take the survey.

Survey Link: http://www.screator.net/showform.php?f=620542889

A full list of the subreddits being surveyed follows:
r/Christianity, r/Atheism, r/Buddhism, r/Hinduism, r/Islam, r/Pagan, r/Judaism, r/TrueAtheism, r/Agnosticism, r/Deism, r/NeoPagan, r/Satanism, r/Scientology, r/Humanism, r/Taoism, r/Shinto, r/UUreddit, r/Pantheism, r/DebateReligion, r/ExploreReligion, r/Catholicism, r/NewAge.

If you have any subreddit suggestions, please comment! I'll probably post it there as well. The survey ends Sunday, July 22, 2012. 

Also, it may take a little while for me to get ALL of these topics up. There is a wait between submissions. But they'll all be up tonight.",,False,self,t5_2qi67,1342581015.0,,,True,t3_wqihf,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/wqihf/religions_of_reddit_survey/,

Some of his 'high society' non-Jewish neighbors brought him to court.

In court, the man was very worried about the outcome. It was the eve of the eight-day holiday, leaving him no time to make alternative arrangements in case the judge ordered him to take down the Sukkah. He prayed for help... and his prayer was answered. 

Judge Ginsburg, who was Jewish himself, had a reputation of being a very wise man. After hearing both sides, he turned around to the observant Jew and scolded him:

""Don't you realize that you live in a posh neighborhood and you must consider the people who live around you? There is a certain decorum which is expected in your area. You have no right to be putting up an ugly hut on this lovely street without a building permit authorizing it. I hereby rule that either you remove the hut, or I will fine you one thousand dollars.

First of all, I was mostly kidding. I realize that the internet isn't always the best medium for dry humor, but I can assure you, it was in jest. I didn't delete or reply or justify the post further because I did not want to hijack the thread, or expose undeniable sectarianism in Judaism, especially to someone who isn't even Jewish and doesn't need to see our ugly side.

Anyway, I'm sorry. My humor was inappropriate. I attended an orthodox yeshiva in Jerusalem where making fun of reformers was casual and rampant, but for me, was always a joke. I should also mention that I am currently non-practicing, and an atheist, though I was born into a reform/conservative home. I don't want anyone to think that my ""brand"" of Judaism is superior, because frankly, it's laughable.

And, I love my Jews. I love all of you. One of my favorite things about this subreddit is to see the plurality in the flair each user posts with. From the Haredi dude who walks backwards the entire way home from the Kotel, to the anti-Israel white supremacist who doesn't realize his thousands of years of Jewish lineage, I love each and every one of you.

I was raised in a  Chabad Lubavitch home by parents that were just about as open-minded and friendly towards Reform and Conservative Jewry as any Orthodox people can be. Both my parents had many friends and relatives who were of different persuasions than they, and they seemed quite fine with them. However, in private they would always tell us that non-Orthodox Judaism is not real Judaism, even though individual non-Orthodox Jews were still real Jews. And I have to say, their case was quite compelling: if the central pillar of Judaism is the Torah, then any bloc that doesn't follow the Torah cannot call itself Jewish (though its members remain Jewish regardless of their beliefs or practices).

Now if you want to disregard the oral Torah, I can understand that. There is absolutely no proof that it has any validity. However, if the written Torah (i.e. the Old Testament) specifically prohibits something in such a way that is not polysemic or open to interpretation, (like the prohibitions of homosexuality or lighting fires) then how can someone who calls themself Jewish disobey that? What, if not belief in the validity of the Torah, distinguishes Judaism from other religions? Surely to be actively Jewish requires more than just a certain lineage.

I myself am now an atheist, but when I go to places like r/Judaism and see that the top post is about a homosexual couple getting married in a synagogue, it seems rather hypocritical to me that in the same room as a Torah (which expressly forbids homosexuality) homosexuals are getting married by a clergyman (or woman) whose religion is based on that same book.

Now, I realize that this question probably comes off as more accusatory than inquisitive, but I suspect that it probably only exists due to my ignorance of your beliefs, but I'm hoping that you can enlighten me.

”...If statistics are right, the Jews constitute but one percent of the human race. It suggests a nebulous dim puff of stardust lost in the blaze of the Milky way. properly, the Jew ought hardly to be heard of, but he is heard of, has always been heard of. He is as prominent on the planet as any other people, and his commercial importance is extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk. His contributions to the world’s list of great names in literature, science, art, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are also away out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers. He has made a marvelous fight in this world, in all the ages; and had done it with his hands tied behind him. He could be vain of himself, and be excused for it.

The Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet with sound and splendor, then faded to dream-stuff and passed away; the Greek and the Roman followed; and made a vast noise, and they are gone; other people have sprung up and held their torch high for a time, but it burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have vanished. The Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind. All things are mortal but the Jew; all other forces pass, but he remains.

I flew to Tampa, Florida a few weeks ago for the Republican National Convention. When I arrived, I was escorted into a large room where all the Convention speakers of the day gathered along with Congressman, Senators, Governors and other politicians.

A woman approached me, stared at me, and then asked ""Who are you??""

I responded politely, ""I am Meir Soloveichik."".

""Are you from Florida,"" she asked.

""No,"" I said, ""I am from NY"".

She looked puzzled and confused, which I found confusing, since I figured most people knew there were a lot of Jews who lived in NY.

Anyway, she smiled and walked away. She then approached me again just a few moments later with her husband.

She said to me, ""Meir Soloveichik -- I'd like to introduce you to my husband, Congressman Walker."" The Congressman and I shook hands.

Then the woman asked, ""Can you please tell me what city in NY you are the Mayor (Meir) of??""'

(After the the Congregation roared with laughter, Rabbi Soloveichik continued as follows...) 'And that, Ladies and Gentleman, was the first time in my life that a person was more impressed with my first name than my last name!!!'

When that does happen, I won't be on 40 bajillion hours a week like I am now. I talked with boriskin, and we agreed we could use another mod. Two things come into play with such a thing.

1. What do the current mods want in a new mod?

2. What does the community want in a new mod?

For me, I would want a somewhat active member of the community with some CSS knowledge. But what I want may not be what you want. *This thread is not to discuss who will become a mod, but what the community wants from the current mod team, and what the community would want in a new mod.*

This will be relevant discussion to have now, so when I do get a job (pretty please with a bag of cherries on top), I can make a thread asking for nominations. Of course, the current mod team will get to make the final decision. But we feel it is important to hear what the community wants to help us make the best decision possible.

Upvote...you know the drill.

PS. A year ago, /r/Judaism had just under 20,000 page views, and we have 95,000 so far this month. Just some thoughts that drive the reason another mod is important.

PPS. I got the job. I will be making a followup on Wednesday.

A random guy goes to a Chabad rabbi and asks him why he's comfortable with so many people driving to his shul on Shabbat.

Chabad rabbi: What are you talking about?

Random guy: Aren't you aware of all the people that are driving here?

Chabad rabbi: I have no idea what you're talking about. No one drove into the shul. Every person who came here walked in through the door. How they got to that point is their own business.

The point of me telling this story is that people come to this subreddit to discuss Jewish things and to learn Jewish things. What people do outside of that is their own business and people shouldn't be made to feel uncomfortable because of their level of observance.

I stopped in the community of South Woodford and began walking down the High Street (main street).

I stopped in front of a row of benches to listen to an older gentleman playing the saxophone.  An elderly lady sitting nearby struck up a conversation with me and we discussed jazz and the nice weather.  Then the saxophonist stopped and started speaking to me, since he'd overheard that I lived in New Orleans for several years.  We talked about Preservation Hall and Tipitina's and other venues - places he'd played!

Then another older gentleman walked up and requested St James Infirmary.  I had never heard it on the saxophone, and I told them so.  I told them that I'd only ever heard Kermit Ruffins do it on trumpet.  Oh, they all liked Kermit Ruffins, wouldn't you know it?  And had I seen him live?  Of course, I'd seen him at Vaughn's several times (the bar he co-owns).  

Well this entire conversation went on for 15-20 minutes and it was super awesome.  And then, the best thing happened.

I began to excuse myself because I really did want to go out seeking a job.  And then something happened that hasn't happened in at least 4 years now.

They all wished me Shabbat Shalom in turn.  My voice caught in my throat.  I thought I would cry.  I haven't heard someone say that in person in so long.  I told them that they'd made my Pesach and I wished them Shabbat Shalom and I wandered on my way.

There's actually an epilogue to this little tale, too.

When I got off of the train at my stop on my way back home later, I was walking past a grocery store and I saw this very stooped, elderly lady struggling along with her bags.  I asked her if she would allow me to carry her things.  She was delighted and tickled.  It was a lovely experience speaking with her.

She asked why I would offer to carry her things, and not wanting to say, ""you looked like you needed the help!"", I said that I wanted the conversation.  She looked around and up at me, I stand at least 18 inches taller than her, and she said she understood that.  Her husband died having his afternoon tea 6 weeks ago, and she'd been lonely ever since with no one to speak with.  

We carried on several blocks to her bus station, having our lovely little conversation.  She was telling me that her granddaughter recently got married and they were coming for dinner tonight.  I asked what she was going to have, and she said that they were going to do a late passover seder since she hadn't been feeling up to it last weekend.  At the bus stop she wished me a Shabbat Shalom and we parted.

I have to think that having my hair fixed up nice, having on a suit, and wearing my kippah brought out the older Jews eager to have someone to chat with.  The Jewish neighbourhoods aren't *really* where I am, any more.  Just the old folks are here now, and a few poorer Jews.  Everyone else has moved half an hour west.

I suppose the older folks get lonely, particularly for ""landsmen"".  

:)

I will be making an effort from now on to be every bit as approachable - and kippah-wearing (whatever I've been warned against it here) - because it's what I should do, it makes me feel great, and apparently it makes a few other people feel at home again.

1354131619.0,34,self.Judaism,13y6g8,"[UPDATE] For those who care, I am that Jewish student who wore Tzitzit for a project for a week. Here is my reflection paper, some had asked to see it when it's written. ",optometry_j3w1993,39,5,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/13y6g8/update_for_those_who_care_i_am_that_jewish/,"Tzitzit

For my extra credit assignment I took on the mitzvah of wearing tzitzit for a week straight. I began the night before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, and ended the following week. It only seemed appropriate that I begin carrying out an extra mitzvah during the holiest days of the year. For some background first, I am not the most observant Jew in the world, however I feel that I observe more than other secular Jews that are my peers. I try to keep kosher, and put on Tefillin every morning.  I had for years been curious about wearing tzitzit, what they actually mean, and what it would feel like to wear a part of the traditional Jewish wardrobe. The first day I wore it, was Yom Kippur. I had always kept the holiday holy by fasting and praying with my father at home, however wearing the tzitzit gave me a new insight into the meaning behind mitzvot. I felt a deeper connection with the almighty. It reminded me of the feeling I get when I wrap Tefillin every morning, however now the feeling lasted all day. It was a whole new experience for me. When I returned to classes while wearing the tzitzit I was surprised by the looks I was receiving in my direction. I noticed many people would stop and just look at the strings hanging from my shirt. At times I felt judged by others, however at other times, no one seemed to care. One of the labs I was performing at the time was with mussels, a type of shellfish. My professor noticed I was wearing the tzitzit, had a kippah on my head, and he asked me if I was comfortable with handling these specimans. I was of course ok with handling them due to the scientific nature of the experiment, and of course I wasn’t ingesting them. However this gave me a sense of pride knowing that Jews are respected amongst many individuals, and that the ones who gave me dirty looks or judging eyes on passing should not reflect the TCNJ population as a whole. 


My most telling incident however was on the basketball courts. I frequent them quite often to play the sport I love, and that I’m not too bad at. I’m no Michael Jordan, but I can hold my own in a game with “experienced” players. I rarely have a hard time getting onto a team to play with the random individuals who show up to play, because I am decently good at basketball. However, I went to play and decided to keep the tzitzit on, as this project for me slowly turned into a social experiment versus simply keeping the mitzvah alone. I was not offered to be on a team as I usually am used to and to work harder to “earn” my spot. I even overheard some of the students whisper, “are we sure we want this Jew to play?” I have always been very proud of my Jewish identity however, and am not ashamed for the world to know I’m a carrier of Jewish blood. Quite on the contrary, I always wear my large Star of David around my neck so that people know that I am a Jew. However, wearing tzitzit transformed me from simply being a student who happens to be Jewish, to becoming a Jew. I had heard about this distinction in the eyes of the gentiles before, however now I had experienced it first-hand. 
As the week came to a close I had a lot to reflect on. How the others looks and judgments made me feel, how wearing tzitzit made me feel closer to G-d in a way I never felt before. Many conflicting thoughts and emotions raced through my head. However, I reached the decision not to continue wearing them, for now. I need to elaborate on this point, however. 


When wearing tzitzit, one is reminded of G-ds omnipresence and of the miztvot of the Torah. I felt much guilt whilst wearing the tzitzit for this reason. I am not an observant Jew. I do not foresee in my future that I will lachzor beTshuva, to return to truth. I am happy being a religious-secular Jew if one can exist. Also, I feel like while wearing tzitzit I should reflect the ideals of practices of traditional Judaism. A casual everyday sinner as myself should not be wearing them as to not deceive the public into thinking something that I do is acceptable in the eyes of mainstream Judaism. Perhaps one day I will feel the pull to wear them all the time and to live my life in accordance with Torah law, however now is not that time for me as an individual.

March 7, 2013
Dear Friends,
I am writing about a very urgent matter.

Harvey Paretzky, a dear friend and member of our community, is suffering from kidney failure and desperately needs a kidney transplant as soon as possible.
He cannot survive long-term without a transplant. Saving a person's life is a great mitzvah. By donating a kidney, you can literally save Harvey's life.

Harvey is working with Renewal, a Jewish non-profit organization, which facilitates and supports all aspects of the kidney transplants process. Below is a fact sheet from Renewal detailing the donor process and explaining why the health risks for the donor are minimal. If you have type O blood, and meet certain other specific criteria, you will be a potential donor.

For additional information, contact Renewal at:
R612@renewal.org
(718) 431-9831, ext. 311 (patient reference #R612)
This letter was sent with Harvey's approval.
Rabbi Yaakov Luban

Renewal Fact Sheet

WHO CAN BE A DONOR?
Donors need to be between the ages of 18 and early 70's and can include family and friends or even an altruistic donor. An ideal donor should have compatible blood type with the recipient.
Typically, someone who has cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, heart disease, liver disease, sickle cell disease, HIV or hepatitis C will not qualify to be a donor, but are not automatically ruled out.

WHAT ARE THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH BEING A DONOR?
The risks of donation are similar to those involved with any major surgery, such as bleeding and infection. Current research indicates that kidney donation does not change life expectancy or increase a person's risks of developing kidney disease or other health problems.

HOW IS IT DETERMINED IF A PROSPECTIVE DONOR'S KIDNEY IS A GOOD MATCH?
Matching donor kidney to recipients is based entirely upon blood group compatibility and antigen matching, not upon age, race or gender. In addition to tissue matching donor to the recipient, blood types must also be compatible. The most common blood type is O, which is present in fifty percent of the population. Even if the donor isn't a match directly to the recipient, it can still benefit the recipient through a swap. More on swaps later.
Tissue matching and more advanced Luminex testing between the donor and the recipient is done by the hospital to determine compatibility between a donor and recipient. These tests of compatibility are also performed to identify the presence of any antibodies that would cause rejection from that specific donor. All this is accomplished by blood tests.

HOW IS LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY PERFORMED?
During the surgery, a few very small incisions are made in the abdomen to insert laparoscopic instruments. The laparoscope contains a miniature camera that helps guide the surgical team. Once the kidney dissection is complete, a 3-4 inch incision is made to allow for the removal of the kidney. These incisions are usually closed using stitches that absorb on their own so they do not need to be removed.
For precautionary reasons, the donor usually spends 1-2 days in the hospital following surgery.

WHAT AFFECTS WILL SURGERY HAVE ON DONOR?
You may feel tired for the first week or two after the surgery and are encouraged to rest and limit your activities during this period. You should not lift anything that weighs more that 20 lbs for the first four-six weeks. You may also have some swelling around the incision area and should plan to wear loose, comfortable clothes. You are encouraged to be active and walking is considered excellent exercise during this period. A leave from work is recommended for approximately two weeks following surgery.

WHAT KIND OF FOLLOW-UP IS NEEDED?
You will have a post-operative appointment with your surgeon 1-2 weeks after the surgery. Additional follow-up appointments will be scheduled 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after your donation. Annual check ups will suffice thereafter.

WHO PAYS FOR THE MEDICAL COSTS?
All expenses of testing required for the living donor evaluation as well as the hospitalization costs and physician services provided during the donation process are covered either by recipient's insurance or Medicare.

WHAT ABOUT MY OTHER EXPENSES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE?
All non-medical expenses such as lost wages, travel/transportation costs and transplant related expenses that are incurred during the donation process will be reimbursed by Renewal.

IF I WISH TO BE A KIDNEY DONOR, HOW DO I PROCEED?
A prospective donor should contact Renewal who, in turn, will put him/her in touch with the transplant coordinator to begin the process.
Once it has been determined that the potential donor and recipient are compatible, additional testing is done on the donor in order to safeguard the donor's health and to ensure that the donor has adequate kidney function. The donor evaluation is usually done at the recipients transplant center, though at times can be done at a hospital close to the donor. Most testing can he arranged around work and school schedules. Usually the hospital will do all testing and appointments for one day.
In general, the donor evaluation period takes approximately 4-6 weeks to complete.

IS A DONOR MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP KIDNEY DISEASE OR MEDICAL PROBLEMS LATER IN LIFE?
The answer is no. Donors are not more likely to experience kidney disease or medical problems than the general population.

THE EFFECTS ON LIFE SPAN OF DONORS
Potential kidney donors do not need to worry about the long-term effects such a donation might have on their health and longevity.
A recent report published in the New England Journal of Medicine analyzed the outcome for nearly 3,700 donors who were studied for as long as 40 years. This first long-term study of kidney donors has found that people who give kidneys to others not only have a normal life span, they also have fewer kidney problems than the general population.
""We're hoping that these results will make the decision to donate easier for people and alleviate anxiety about living with one kidney,"" the authors say.
A great video with detailed information on kidney donation can be seen on Renewal's website. ",,False,self,t5_2qi67,False,,,True,t3_1a2xa3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1a2xa3/desperately_seeking_kidney_donor/,

Feel free to discuss any and all parts of it, or to add to it.

The Messiah will do many things.

&gt;The whole world will worship the One God of Israel. Isaiah 2:11-17, Isaiah 40:5, Zephaniah 3:9

Currently does not happen.

&gt;Knowledge of God will fill the world. Isaiah 11:9, 45:23, 66:23, Jeremiah 31:33, Zechariah 3:9, 8:23, 14:9,16, Ezekiel 38:23, Psalm 86:9

This means irrefutable evidence.  Knowledge, not faith.

&gt;All Israelites will be returned to their homeland Isaiah 11:12, 27:12-13, Ezekiel 11:17, 36:24, Deuteronomy 30:3

I am still in America.

&gt;The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness. Isaiah 51:11

Holocaust?  Inquisition?  Progroms?

&gt;Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel. Isaiah 52:13-53:5

Holocaust deniers

&gt;The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance. Zechariah 8:23

Spiritual, not monetary.

&gt;Weapons of war will be destroyed. Ezekiel 39:9

Not destroyed by nuclear weapons.

&gt;All of the dead will rise again Isaiah 26:19

You claim one dude, I want them all.

&gt;A person’s genealogical/tribal membership are transmitted exclusively through one’s physical father. Numbers 1:18, Jeremiah 33:17

Jesus whose alleged sketchy genealogy is maternal cannot possibly be a descendent of the tribe of Judah

&gt;Third Temple will be rebuilt. Micah 4:1, Ezekiel 40-42, Isaiah 2:2-3, Malachi 3:4, Zechariah 14:20-21,

Not a person, but a physical building.

&gt;World Peace: Isaiah 2:4, 11:6, 60:18 Micah 4:1-4, Hosea 2:20

Open a newspaper lately? 

&gt;Christianity claims that Jesus ""Fulfilled the law""

According to Deut 13:2-7, this makes Jesus a false prophet.

&gt;All Jews will embrace Torah observance. Ezekiel 37:24, Deuteronomy 30:8-10, Jeremiah 31:32, Ezekiel 11:19-20, 36:26-27.

How many Jews are fully observant today?

&gt;The Messiah can not be part God. Deut 6:4

Not explicitly Jesus, but the idea that the Messiah will be Godly is antithetical to Judaism. [Chapter 1](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Chapter-One.htm)

The Messiah will be a warrior king.  He will be a human, born of a *young woman*, and will **not die and come back as he will have a mortal life span to fulfill the prophecies.**  As per [Bar Kochba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Kochba), who was thought to be the Messiah.  [Once he died](http://imgur.com/a/N1kbb), the Rabbis shrugged and said ""I guess it was not him"".  So the Messiah must be alive in order to fulfill the prophecies.

[humor],Deuteronomy,32,3,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/rgk71/once_upon_a_time_in_a_far_away_land_there_lived_a/,"Once upon a time in a far away land there lived a king who had
a Jewish advisor. The king relied so much on the wisdom of his
Jewish advisor that one day he decided to elevate him to head
advisor. After it was announced, the other advisors objected.
After all, it was bad enough just to sit in counsel with a Jew.
But to allow one to 'Lord it over them,' was just too much to bear.
 
Being a compassionate ruler, the King agreed with them, and ordered
the Jew to convert. What could the Jew do? One had to obey the King, and so he did. As soon as the act was done, the Jew felt great
remorse for this terrible decision. As days became weeks, his remorse
turned to despondency, and as months passed, his mental depression
took its toll on his physical health. He became weaker and weaker.
Finally he could stand it no longer. His mind was made up. He burst
in on the king and cried, ""I was born a Jew and a Jew I must die.
Do what you want with me, but I can no longer deny my faith.""
 
The King was very surprised. He had no idea that the Jew felt so
strongly about it. ""Well, if that is how you feel,"" he said, ""then
the other advisors will just have to learn to live with it.
Your counsel is much too important to me to do without.
Go and be a Jew again"" he said.
 
The Jew felt elated. He hurried back home to tell the good news
to his family. He felt the strength surge back into his body as
he ran. Finally, he burst into the house and called out to his wife.
""Rifka, Rifka, we can be Jews again, we can be Jews again.""
His wife GLARED back at him angrily and said, ""You couldn't wait
until after Passover!?""

Since becoming a mod here only a short while ago, I have done a lot of changes with the help of boriskin.  There has been a lot of work done on the sidebar, with a lot of information added.  We have started a few community projects, and expanded on others.  In the past year, our size has doubled.  I remember when I first joined a few posts every day and hardly any discussion.  Now thanks to the hard work of our members, we have a flood of news and plenty of discussion.

What can you do to help us keep growing?  Excellent question!  You can contribute to the Dvar Torah project, or our other various projects.  You can make suggestions for side bar changes.  You can help us make this subreddit a friendlier place.  Most importantly you can participate and be an active redditor here.  And I would love to see more community interaction happen.  **Tell us what you want to see in this thread.**

As for one project, the denomination thread; it did not go where I was expecting it to.  I will be looking at making a google doc that lists and explains various denominations and their **beliefs** and how they see Judaism.  I will be leaving the current thread up as it does lead to interesting discussion, but I want to make something a little neater as a resource we can read.

On my bus ride home I was graced with the classic ""shalom"". I was like ""oh great... Another random that knows 2 Hebrew words"". Turns out it was a guy, my age (around 20), claiming he was a ""Jews for Jesus"" and just wanted to ask me questions. I couldn't resist... I played the game. 

He started off telling me that his mother was Jewish &amp; that we were ""brothers"". He is a believer in the second testimont(Christ). I told him I was orthodox - that's where the fun began.  

The first thing that he questioned was how us orthodox know/are certain that God hears us/listens. I started explaining to him we believe &amp; have 100%faith/trust (I need a better response for next time). I retaliated with ""how do YOU guys know that God responds?"". He went on about how he hears voices or a 'voice' (which just made me suggest a mental home/asylum). He followed up with claiming a ""conscious feeling told him so"" which I once again asked if he needed to see a doctor for these voices.


The next point he brought in was how we disagree with the exact text of the original testimont. I had to bring in gemarah for this - *sigh* . They never quite seem to understand that.(this guy did understand it a bit)

Following up was my attempt to go on the offense - I asked him the classic: ""You do agree that the old testimont was given in front of the entire Jewish people?"". It took me a bit to get him to admit that he agreed - that's when I went for the kill. ""If you agree God spoke to all the Jewish people the first time around , isn't it a bit weird for Him to come around again and change it all ? Mind you it was only said to one person and one person only the second time around. Nowadays if somebody goes around telling people that God spoke to him people would think he's crazy"". He didn't really have a response - he agreed its ""weird"" &amp; moved back into how we know God forgives us... But by then it was nearing my stop and I bid my farewell.

We recently got hit by SRD, and it appears we survived. I now want to bring to light how I moderate and if it should change.

1) Any comment that attacks a user is warned. Repeat offenses lead to bans. Temporary or permanent. ""Fuck you"" or the like. This is not the intention of this post.

2) Comments that are downright rude/hostile. We have seen a few of these recently. I have been asking people to keep it polite. Does this need a change? I personally do not think so, but I am asking the community for feedback.

3) Comments that do not contribute. These are usually seen in response to the first two categories. Comments like ""get off your high horse"" or ""You are stupid"" and the like as seen in response to usually one of the first two categories. I sometimes remove them, I usually do not. I often ask these people to be polite/make a comment with content that contributes to the discussion. Does this also need a change? Again, I don't think so, but I am asking for feedback.

As always, if you report a comment (and if you feel it should be reported, do so), message the mods with a reason as we may not always know why a comment was reported. This is usually the case. This isn't usually the case for things like anti-semitism, which tends to be obvious. Still, message the mods. And to clarify, all three categories happen across all groups of users.

1358274082.0,30,self.Judaism,16mp8n,State of the subreddit.,namer98,31,1,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16mp8n/state_of_the_subreddit/,"Hello /r/Judaism!

A lot has changed over the past year. Sadly, I don't know our exact subscription numbers from a year ago, but we have about doubled since ten months ago. We have amazing growth. When I first signed up for Reddit, /r/Judaism was around 500 members. Looking at the traffic stats, hardly a day goes by without ten new subscribers. 

We have added two more mods. /u/yonkletron and /u/harimadsol. Both who are wonderful and put in a lot of time making sure things run smoothly so I can reap all of the reward.

So, what has been going on? We ran our first [bestof](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/167kut/best_of_winners/) as per the reddit initiative for each community to do their own. It wasn't the most successful, but we did it, and next year will be better. I actually still have three gold credits left for future contests. The mods have thrown around the possibility of a writing contest of some form. But if you have ideas, please tell us about them!

The second Chanukah swap, but this time it was run by the mods. We went from seven to forty participants. It had some bumps ([And still has some bumps](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16kfxe/chanukah_swap_update/)), but overall it was fantastic.

We are doing a [movie/book](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/146l13/bookmovie_club_update/) club. So don't forget. This months book is A Pigeon and A Boy By Meir Shalev which I am starting today. Discussion will be at the end of the month. This will run all year and covers a wide swath of genres.

[The wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/wiki/index) went live. All who are able and willing are welcome to contribute. Add more pages, fix up the pages on there. All you need is 250 karma from /r/Judaism and an account that is 91 days old. (Hint, I have nearly 9,000 from here, 250 isn't so hard) The wiki is currently home to the denomination and conversion resources, among other things.

[The first meetup](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/11cajn/the_meetup_photo/). All mods are in this photo. Nothing so exciting. Next time we will aim for more people. Or you can all come for Shabbos in Baltimore. More social stuff is new including our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/481182938572651/) and a [chat room](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-judaism).

Some CSS stuff, the sidebar had some nice changes, and the downvote button had its changes made this year. I honestly think both have really improved the look and feel of /r/Judaism. We are always looking for more ways to improve the community. And all the way back to the first thing I did was make text flair accessible to all. 

So, what will be new? That is up to all of you. What do you want to see in the future? It can be ideas, projects, [a new banner](http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/16kq45/dear_mods_can_we_improve_the_banner/). What I want to see the most are more people posting content from everywhere. The best way to make this place better is by posting content and suggestions.

[Plug for the Dvar Torah Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Apss4g0b9knYdGVPQ0s2VU81MUowRFh3QTRFQktWUkE&amp;authkey=CL6mkrQP&amp;hl=en&amp;authkey=CL6mkrQP#gid=0). Everybody from all points of view are welcome to sign up.

Upvote so all can see and because I have too much free time on my hands.

1344462399.0,30,self.Judaism,xwkjk,Why I'm thinking about walking away from r/judaism.,sweetjackmccry,39,9,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/xwkjk/why_im_thinking_about_walking_away_from_rjudaism/,"Hi everyone. Rather than keep it to myself or slip away quietly, I have decided to share with you that I am giving a good amount of thought to walking away from r/judaism. I thought I’d explain my thinking in the hopes that perhaps things could get better.

Let me start with my bona fides. Not to toot my own horn, but I am something of an expert in Judaism. That, after all, is the job of a rabbi. I spent many years in conversion classes, college, and finally in rabbinical school learning the intricacies of topics that most of the world hasn’t even heard of. Now, some of you might know that the plight of the rabbi in the modern rabbinate is that we sit around waiting to give answers but no one is actually asking us questions. That is an exaggeration of course, but there is some truth to it. So when I stumbled across r/judaism and saw people actually asking questions, I took it as a godsend.

So I jumped in and started answering questions, and I immediately hit a brick wall. In my world I can give an answer and it is prima facie accepted. On r/judaism if I write something which deviates from the standard (shall we say “Orthodox”?) position, I can count on a one-word response: “Source?” I mentioned this to my wife and she told me that what was bothering me was my ego, and of course I can’t rely on strangers to just take my word for it. And in an ideal world, wouldn’t everyone be asking for the sources so that we could all learn the relevant psukim and sugiyot together? So I tried to clamp down on my rabbi-sized ego and answer to the best of my ability.

But there’s a problem. I may be an expert but I’m not an encyclopedia. These are things I have gleaned over the course of a lifetime and I usually don’t remember page numbers. Always being asked to provide the source was taking precious 30-minute blocks out of my day as I scanned dapim and tried to hunt on Google for the Gemara I studied many many years ago.

What’s more, I found myself growing increasingly agitated by some of the responses. I am willing to suspend k’vod harav for the sake of this semi-anonymous forum, but not k’vod habriyot. This is especially true in producing non-Orthodox responses. I found that providing the sources actually fanned the flames of division, because I was reading the source with my Conservative lens while many others were reading it with an Orthodox lens. Soon we were arguing not about the question or the source but about how we read a text. These are fundamental issues and they demand respect from everyone involved. Nobody on r/judaism is stupid and we are all deserving of respect for our fundamental convictions. I am not interested in telling anyone to walk away from their Orthodox viewpoint and I would never call it ill-informed. Of course I would appreciate the same courtesy. I am tired of the rush of adrenaline which comes every time I see the red envelope. I just don’t have the time or the inclination to constantly defend Conservative Judaism or my own eclectic viewpoint every single time I open my mouth.

So that’s where I am today. I see people asking questions and I would like to offer my perspective but I don’t have the free time or the patience to deal with the back-and-forth that will inevitably occur. The result seems likely to be either that the Conservative position will go undefended or it will go unoffered. I am hopeful that there is another alternative, but I’m not sure how to go about implementing it.

2. If there are any consumables sent, they must be kosher, with a hechsher. ([Unless one is not needed as per standard](http://www.star-k.org/cons-appr-liquor.htm))

3. Follow all local, state, and federal laws if shipping any goodies such as alcohol or fireworks.

4. Nothing can come from Christian-oriented websites/stores. If the express purpose of the site/store is to push a Christian agenda, do not purchase from there. I hope this is clear, if not, feel free to respond.

When people make Holocaust jokes or use references to it in order to add meaning and connotation to other concepts (feminazi, for example) it takes something that is truly and deeply horrifying and makes light of it. It dismisses the immense pain and suffering of millions of people Jews and non-Jews alike.

In a larger scope, it is a poignant demonstration of how language is a fundamental part of the development and growth of societal norms and values.  I think people using words like ""feminazi"" is a problem. In addition to the consequences noted above, it adds severely negative connotations to the concept of feminism as a whole and only stands to increase divisiveness and reactionary attitudes.

I frequently find it difficult to speak up when people make Holocaust jokes, or use words like ""feminazi"" or ""bitch.""  I get a lot of flak for it even from my friends who share my values.  I still maintain that saying something in those situations is one of many ways that we can continue to make the world a better place.  I hope that anyone reading this will step up like this in whatever social situation they're in.  Maybe if enough people start to do it, it won't be so hard.

So, as a parting note, this experience only reaffirms my conviction to wear my Kippah proudly.  Not only to display my pride, but to set an example for any marginalized group that it is okay to represent yourself without fear.  Or at least, with bravery.

I recently got a test done that I thought may interest some of you. As a Jew with European roots and an interest in my history, I've always felt robbed by the fact that I can only trace back to my great-great grandparents, at the most. I read in a book about a test that can be done to discover the roots of your ancestors and where they ended up, and how. 

It's run by a website called Family Tree DNA. (Link: http://www.familytreedna.com/). It's a website run by a Jew that has a huge network of Jewish DNA test results. I paid for this test to be done to me. They sent me two swabbing kits, and a couple months later they posted my results. With them I was able to see where my ancestors went and even look at people with shared DNA and the chances of us having a common male ancestor 4 generations back, 8, etc. 

Though the Y-DNA test can only be done on men (obviously), there are tests that women can take too. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. 

I'm not endorsing the website at all, nor am I affiliated. I'm simply sharing my story and the website's legitimacy in case anyone has the same interest in their past that I do. 

Thanks for reading!

If you can help it, please roughly follow the format below, and include the location, meat/dairy/pareve status, and kosher certifying rabbi or agency:

----
----

**Boca Raton, Florida**

Jon's Place (dairy, cholov yisroel):  Pizza, miscellaneous Italian, sandwiches, salads, wraps.  Known for pizza though, it was for a time the only game in town.  Internationally famous, apparently.  ORB kosher supervision.

Avigdor's Mozart Café (dairy, cholov yisroel):  Pizza, Italian, Israeli.  Open late, and the one in Hollywood is (locally) famously open 24/6.  ORB.

Euro Fusion (dairy, cholov yisroel):  French, Italian, Greek, Israeli, pizza.  Expect the extremely friendly owners to come and sit down with you and strike up a conversation.  ORB.

Boca Pita Express (glatt):  Israeli, Chinese, American (fast food).  Try the shawarma, the General Tso's chicken, and the Cajun burger, respectively.  ORB.

18th Street Deli (glatt):  NYC-style deli.  Newer establishment by the owners of Euro Fusion (which is next door).  Excellent overstuffed sandwiches and a dozen different kinds of sausages, and literally the best knishes I've ever had.  All the bread is baked on-premises daily, too.  Very highly recommended.  ORB.

Fran's Chicken Haven (glatt):  Southern-style fried chicken.  Open since 1964, newly kosher since early 2012, but they didn't change their recipe, just got rid of the treif menu items.  Good lunch specials and reasonably priced.  ORB.

Sagi's Mediterranean Grill (glatt):  Israeli.  Formerly known as Falafel Armon, been around at least two decades.  A bit pricey, but it's good food.  Try the shawarma, just about the best in town.  Has been open for Pesach in the past, not sure if he's doing it again this year.  ORB.

Orchid Garden (glatt):  High-end Chinese.  This place has been there forever, I think it may be the oldest existing kosher establishment in Boca.  It can be a bit pricey if you go for the full meal (soup, appetizers, entree, dessert), but it's worth it.  Expect Eli, the owner, to drop by your table personally at least twice to offer kind words.  ORB.

Grill Time (glatt):  High-end fusion steakhouse.  Nice place, always packed, even if it is kinda pricey.  Usually open for Pesach.  ORB.

Asia (glatt): Chinese, Japanese, full sushi bar.  Excellent food, very pricey, service tends to be a bit slow because it's usually packed.  Sometimes open for Pesach with an alternate menu - *not kitniyos safe*.  ORB.

Marcus's Kosher Chinese (glatt):  Less-expensive Chinese.  Relatively new place, good soups, not totally impressed with the entrees, though they may have changed recipes since I was there, which was only the once (it's not in my neighborhood).  ORB.

JCC Café (dairy, possibly not cholov yisroel but I haven't been there in years):  This was the first establishment covered by the ORB at its inception in the very early 90s.  It's the little café inside the Boca JCC - you might find anyone there to strike up a conversation with.  ORB.

Aside from all of these, there's two kosher supermarkets (Kosher Marketplace and Amazing Savings), a standalone pas yisroel (and, for dairy stuff, cholov yisroel) bakery and the pas yisroel (but for dairy, *not* cholov yisroel) bakery in one of the local supermarkets, and off the top of my head, six or seven ice cream/gelato/frozen yogurt shops.  Just about all ORB, except for Amazing Savings which is under KM, the vaad of Miami-Dade.

I'm also probably totally forgetting some other kosher restaurants, and I didn't even get to the caterers.

All serving a 60,000-strong Jewish population (plus the surrounding cities). :)

1368647242.0,24,self.Judaism,1eei4d,First Encounter with a Jew for Jesus,thegreenlentil,30,6,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1eei4d/first_encounter_with_a_jew_for_jesus/,"On the way to class this morning I noticed a man standing by one of the campus buildings in a blue t-shirt with some Hebrew on it (I can't read Hebrew but I want to learn). I took off my headphones and heard him singing very passionately. It sounded like Hebrew but it wasn't anything I recognized, though I know people sing different prayers in different ways. I'm still fairly certain it wasn't any typical morning prayer (this was at about 10:00 AM). I think he was mostly doing it for attention, which, if it is a real Jewish prayer, is very inappropriate. 

I didn't realize what I was getting into at this point and was just curious. I waited for him to stop singing so I could talk to him and check out his pamphlets. And of course the pamphlet was for Jews for Jesus (it was weird and had Justin Bieber on it). I could have left right then (and should have!) but I kind of wanted to engage with him and see what would say despite the fact that I was almost late for class. I am not a smart man before 11:00 AM. 

He was very personable and friendly. He went through the whole Jesus died for us spiel and also kept dropping Hebrew words to prove that he was legit as a Jew, I guess...He explained to me that his shirt signified Jesus = the Messiah (at this point I'm really kicking myself...). But I kept talking to him and I said ""You know, I don't agree with your organization"" and he cut me off and said ""Oh, it's not really about an organization, it's a very individual decision, etc."" Yeah, right. He also kind of twisted Shavuot into being about Jesus as well (ie, that the messianic prophecies were given to us within the Torah, as the important thing.....hmmm). 

But I was still trying to be nice to him because I did not have the energy or the mental wherewithal to get in a real debate. I tried to remember all the reasons posted in this subreddit to combat the idea that Jesus is the Messiah and  all of this stuff but I couldn't come up with anything articulate. If I had even mentioned the Shema, that would have been something but I was jumpy and distracted and after a while just left. He tried to get my contact info...he wanted my phone number but I told him my name so he could find me on Facebook because I didn't know how else to get rid of him...I am going to lock down my Facebook as much as possible so he doesn't find me or so if he harasses me it will be to a minimum. He started singing again as soon as we stopped talking. 

I learned from this how devious these people are, going after Jews like me who were raised secular and might not be aware of certain things. The Hebrew on the shirt thing is really misleading and shitty for someone who is a Jew and can't read it, for one thing. At least I know better now for next time. I also am reminded of the strength of my own belief. Though I am not always sure how and to what extent I believe, I know I do believe in Hashem, and that He is One, and that it's wrong for anyone else to tell me that I should not. I am not fully practicing yet but I want to be. It is not every day that I can say the Shema in the mornings and at night but when I do, I mean it, and that's something no one can take from me.

",WolfyMcWolferson,26,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/152u84/my_experience_with_judaism_and_a_question_of_faith/,"Hey guys, I'm new here. Not to Judaism though, I grew up Modern Orthodox, and my entire family is practicing. 

I was fully practicing up until I first got to college in NYC 2 years ago. In fact, I was one of a handful of religious individuals in my local Jewish highschool. Whatever obstacle life threw at me, I incorporated Orthodox tradition to resolve it; I was able to successfully become highly ranked in USTA tournament tennis by travelling to hotels and walking the distance to the courts if matches were scheduled for the Sabbath. Spiritually, I felt complete. 

Things suddenly transformed when I tried to get involved in the Orthodox community at my university, but found it to be exceedingly cold and unwelcoming. I know this isn't representative of all New York Jewish communities, but I was treated as an ""out of towner,"" someone who didn't go to the local Jewish High Schools, the same Yeshivahs in Israel for a Gap Year, and no effort was made to invite me into any of the social circles. It was weird though: outside of the Hillel circle (which was predominantly Modern Orthodox), I was able to become great friends with many of the Jewish kids on campus, but when it came time to come together for services, they reintegrated into their old, apparently unmodified social circles. 

For the first month of school, I felt completely alone. It was a weird feeling, for someone who was never socially awkward, or unpopular to suddenly be treated differently, despite being of the same faith, even the same religiosity. 

While I struggled to continue to go to Hillel events, my social life did flourished. However, most of my friends were of different faiths. The catalyst was when a friend asked me why I keep the laws that I keep. Suddenly, my standard answers were failing me: I used to believe in a community where everyone was welcome, where if my hometown buddies saw someone who didn't have a Sabbath meal, that guy/girl was coming to one of our houses. Without a community, what was I doing. After first semester, I started to use my phone on the Sabbath. This turned into using the computer, and gradually I lost the Sabbath completely Friday nights, I would take the subways to go to clubs and bars and use money to pay for drinks, meet non-Jewish girls and put their numbers in my phone. 

This felt great for a while, but gradually the guilt started to kick in. My friends would laugh when I would lie to my parents, and comment on my tendency to ""pick and choose"" which laws and customs I was going to follow. Why would I keep kosher, but use electricity on the Sabbath? 

It's been two years since my spiritual world became all convoluted. And while I know that my story doesn't involve some life tragedy, the disconnect I feel from belief is incredibly painful. Over the years, I have tried to go back, to be apart of the community, but my philosophy has changed: why should I have to force my way to be accepted? Shouldn't the transition of leaving home to attend university inherently involve meeting people of all different backgrounds, branching out and culturally expanding your horizons? Why would I want to be a part of a homogeneous group, one which isolates itself from any slight variable form. 

If you have read this so far, then I firstly apologize for any offense, or for appearing angry. The truth is, I'm not angry, just sad. Sad because I feel as though I am lacking a huge part of life that used to define me. And I know many of you may wonder why I didn't attempt to find alternatives to the campus hillel. I'm going to. That's not the point of this post. 

The point is that for any individuals out there (and heck, I know I've been one of them) who see someone who is having a hard time adjusting to a new community, give them a hand. Not only will you be doing a huge mitzvah, but you also have the chance to possibly save someone's faith. We don't have to be so insular. The basic tenants of our tradition exemplify welcoming guests and making them feel at home. So if you see someone who didn't go to the same highschool as everyone else, or isn't from the same town as most, who cares? This person is a member of your faith, someone who believes the same core concepts that you do, and someone who deserves the same friendly ""Good Shabbas"" as anyone of your established companions. 

TL;DR: A welcoming community can make all the difference.     

Edit: Just wanted to thank everyone for their responses--it's honestly really comforting to know that many have been through similar situations and eventually found happiness.

My various firsts are hardly noteworthy - I know they've happened to everyone before, but, this one... this was special. And left a big enough impression that I'm signing up for some extra Torah study classes, right now. 

While I spent last year having my various first holidays, I was quite sick towards the end of Sukkot, and stayed in bed. So as the date loomed, I was getting increasingly antsy about it - having only what I'd read in books to go on, as to what I could expect past the family I study with's simple 'Well, there's going to be a lot of singing, and dancing, and the Torah scrolls get paraded.'

We went, as a family+me, for Ma'ariv, and the whole energy of the shul was... palpable. The whole congregation felt like it was on tenterhooks. It was my first time back at the M.O. shul I'd been going to, since I moved out in June. The kevanah in the air was exciting.

As Ma'ariv passed and the festivities begin, the knot of worry I'd been feeling started to tighten. I kept turning to my friend and his dad, nervously rattling off excuses, and asking them to please let me just watch, and sing, from a distance: ""I can't go up / it would be inappropriate / what if I drop a scroll, and we all have to fast?/ I'm still only preparing for my conversion, I shouldn't be touching the Torah at all / I don't want to desecrate anything!""

Eventually, the scrolls were brought out from the ark. And the moment came to go up and gather, where we could receive them, as a few circles of dancing men started to form up around the bimah. I was half ready to run. As we passed the women's section, my friend flagged his mother. 

""He's too scared to carry the Torah. Will you please put some sense into him?""

""Why are you afraid?"" 

I explained, sheepishly, still eying my seat.

She moved us both away from the crowd on either side of the barrier, and smiled at me. ""My husband, before he converted, before we got married, told me the -exact- same thing at his first Simchat Torah. In the end, he went up, even though he was afraid, like you are. And he loved it. He said it was... incredible. You're going to be just fine, and you're not going to desecrate anything. Now go on. Get in line. And I had better see you dancing up there!""

I got up, and joined my friend in line, and waited, trying to hold on to my nerves. The first of the hakafot ended, and a scroll found itself in my arms.

At first, it was nothing special, past being heavy. Until we all started to circle, and dance, and sing songs I was learning as I heard them for the first time. And until it started to sink in that after two years of study, and after everything, all the praying, the holidays, the fasting, learning Hebrew, changing my life around the Torah...here it was, in my arms, for the very first time. 

It was incredible.

I didn't want to cry, so instead, I sang louder, danced harder, and held tighter to the scroll. I could understand the joy on everyone's faces. The enthusiasm in their voices, and in their bodies.  When, eventually, I passed it off and joined one of the circles of dancers, I caught a glimpse of my friend's mom in the women's section again.

""The Mostaic system of laws and regulations influenced the thinking of the people of John's day. The Jews followed the Old Testament Law of Moses and rejected the idea that the Messiah would establish salvation for the whole world. Instead, He was to come for only the Jews. This view, of course, explains why the Jewish rulers were so upset at Jesus' reading that 'God so loved the *world* . . . that *whosoever* believeth in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.' Such teaching opened the door of salvation to everyon, Gentiles (non-Jews) as well as Jews.""

The person describes their situation, what they feel, and how they think the idea of Orthodoxy being written off as ""a dead antiquated fossil"" is very silly.

Someone commented they hoped to see Orthodoxy give the non-Orthodox movements some more credit and recognition for their own vibrancy and it would lead to mutual respect.  My replies followed with the view that this was a false vibrancy and reasons why.

I am taking time out of my packing for Birthright to address this on a deeper level, so, bare with me.

**Why is Orthodoxy so bothered by Non-Orthodox movements??**

The answer is simple: We predicted, quite correctly, the result of encouraging those movements.

But it definitely is more complex than that.  The answer also draws in history and geography.  Orthodoxy used to just be ""the traditional way"".  There were differing views on individual elements but nobody dared to claim they were going to just upheave everything and throw out large portions of Judaism.

An example: The feud of Litvish(Lithuanian) yeshivaniks and the Chassidim of the Baal Shem Tov.  There was an agreement that Judaism mattered. The problem merely had to do with the difference between rigid legal study or trying to outwardly express the spirituality and connection one felt.  Neither side uprooted anything significant. They kept halacha, and still do, to this day.

However, we do have a problem with the Non-Orthodox movements because of the large amount of inherent changes.  Extreme views such as the denial of G-d, the denial of necessity or value for ritual, and the denial of the religio-legal system(halacha) weren't small things.  They were changes to the very essence of what Judaism was.

So...How can we not be bothered that a whole movement exists that says ""We hold it to be dogma that G-d doesn't need to exist"" or ""We hold it to be dogma that G-d may exist, may not""??  For the last few thousand years, we've believed as a people in the existence of a single all-powerful deity. How could you still be following the original intent of the practice if the very reason, a Higher Power, isn't unquestionable in existence?

Accordingly, history records this as the reason why Conservative/Masorti Judaism came to be.  A group that came out and said ""whoa buddy, why so far?!"". The irony is...they're dying out the fastest. As another poster put in their reply for the other thread, Conservative/Masorti is bleeding people both directions.  The serious become closer to Orthodoxy, while the less serious disassociate entirely.

**Why do you arrogantly feel that we have inferior/non-existant Jewish education? Who made you the arbiter?**

Um...If one considers the amount of Reform attendants of Jewish educational facilities, one sees a VERY SMALL number. Masorti is better about this, though it really depends on the crowd and location.  Of the education received, people would rather water down the few things they'd like to talk about. So...in the end, those kids that do have exposure might be able to stutter out aleph-bet and have a nicely decorate wall full of fingerpaintings of Bible stories.

A vast majority of non-Orthodox children have NO EXPOSURE TO JUDAISM IN ANY FASHION. PERIOD.

Contrast this to say............every kid of large 6-12 member families sitting in yeshiva from age 3 - age 22.  Everyday learning for 12 hours purely Judaism and Jewish topics/philosophy/law/etc.

On 1 side, the alternative to a minimal education of what it means to be Jewish is to merely not have it.  The likelihood by numbers is staggerly on the side of never having exposure!!!

On the other side, a rigorous education. They know their stuff. They are capable of understanding what they believe, why they believe it, etc.  Even if they G-d forbid choose to turn away from religion, they at least have a strong opinion with real support.

Orthodoxy is very upset for good reason.  There are plenty of Orthodox doctors, lawyers, engineers, computer engineers, and all sorts of trades and fields. They are capable of getting a secular education and contrary to the handful of weirdos in Israel or Lakewood, a majority are educated secularly as well.

Yet non-Orthodoxy only seeks to hide people from their Jewish roots. It takes the very approach it accuses the ""Ultra Orthodox"" of, by sheltering and avoiding the ""other side of the educational philosophy spectrum"".

Understand that we are upset because whole generations have no connection to themselves, to each other, and to us. They'd rather go off to shopping malls, party, and pretend to be like others.  The whole flag of ""Open-mindedness"" you rallied behind..That became ""Every man for himselfdom"". It became hating one's own cousins and brothers because they believe in something with an educated opinion that you don't have any proof beyond ""well some guy says""/""I feel it""/""There is too much death in the world"".


As I prepare to go on my Birthright trip, I wonder what I'll encounter. I've looked at their facebooks and I see I'm clearly the only one religious.  I wonder how many of these people will learn something of their background from only this trip, subsidized for them just so they'll feel some sort of connection.

My mother’s family comes from a very long line of practicing Jews.  However, I was denied my birthright because my mother, who also considers herself to be Jewish, attends a Unitarian Universalist congregation. 
 
The UU congregation which my mother attends and in which I was raised is an organized religion, but it is not a faith.  It does not involve conversion, acceptance of a creed, or denial of any other religious beliefs.  My mother went to synagogue and Hebrew school, celebrates every Jewish holiday with her family or local community, and has passed down the traditions and culture of Judaism to me. 
 
I answered honestly, when asked whether my mother is Jewish, or Jewish and another religion.  Had Unitarian Universalism not been an available option, I would not have chosen it.  I assumed, wrongly, that because it was an option, there was also an understanding of what this social institution is (call it a faith if you’d like, it is a social haven for my parents and many liberal-minded people in my southern conservative community).  I did not choose to grow up outside of a synagogue or official Jewish group, but here I am, a Jewish girl officially rejected by one of the largest Jewish institutions in the world. 
 
I am Jewish and this is my birthright.  I want to go to Israel because I feel cheated out of my faith and my heritage.  No one can change the decisions their parents made; I cannot make my mom any more Jewish than she is, nor I, in your eyes.  I should not have to prove my adoration, my faith, my eligibility into this club.  I thought that my reasons for wanting to return to my homeland, my birthright, were exactly what this organization wanted.  Now, I am not sure what your goal or purpose is. 
 
I am Jewish and I will not see you in Israel.  I pray that this institution will rethink its message and accept all Jewish people who need to see the birthplace of their ancestors.

**Chanukkah and Thanksgiving: A once in eternity overlap**

Next year features an anomaly for American Jews - The first day of Chanukkah coincides with Thanksgiving, on 11/28/2013. It turns out that it has never happened before...and it will never happen again.

Thanksgiving is set as the fourth Thursday in November, meaning the latest it can be is 11/28. 11/28 is also the earliest Chanukkah can be. The Jewish calendar repeats on a 19 year cycle, and Thanksgiving repeats on a 7 year cycle. You would therefore expect them to coincide roughly every 19x7 = 133 years. Looking back, this is approximately correct - the last time it would have happened is 1861. However, Thanksgiving was only formally established by President Lincoln in 1863. So, it has never happened before. Why won't it ever happen again?

The reason is because the Jewish calendar is very slowly getting out of sync with the solar calendar, at a rate of 4 days per 1000 years (not bad for a many centuries old calendar!) This means that while presently Chanukkah can be as early as 11/28, over the years the calendar will drift forward, such that the earliest Hanukkah can be is 11/29. The last time Chanukkah falls on 11/28 is 2146 (which happens to be a Monday). Therefore, 2013 is the only time Chanukkah will ever overlap with Thanksgiving.

Of course, if the Jewish calendar is never modified in any way, then it will slowly move forward through the Gregorian calendar, until it loops all the way back to where it is now. So, Chanukkah will again fall on Thursday, 11/28...in the year 79,811.",,False,self,t5_2qi67,False,,,True,t3_174l0g,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/174l0g/hannukkah_and_thanksgiving_overlap_this_year_the/,

For example, every time the issue of kashrut comes up with regard to Judaism as a whole, at least one person inevitably makes some remark about non-Orthodox Jews not ""really"" keeping kosher, etc.

So, what is it that you'd prefer? Would you rather that anyone who's not the frummiest person in the world avoid practicing Judaism at all-- and if so, where would you draw the line as to who's ""frum enough""? How would you feel, for example, about a person who kept a strictly kosher kitchen in their home, but had a more relaxed policy when eating at friends' houses, or about a person who davened 3x a day but (voluntarily, and in a not-necessary-for-preserving-life kind of job) worked on Shabbos? I'm curious to hear your thoughts, and your reasoning for them. Seems like this could be an interesting thing for this community to discuss, as it's a topic that seems to arise often yet doesn't get blatantly talked about a lot.




Note: in an effort to help keep this community accessible for everyone, and avoid sending people on a google goose-chase, I've decided to start defining words that not everyone may know in my posts, since I know we have many community members who are considering conversion, weren't raised in a very observant household, etc. If anyone thinks this is annoying or unnecessary, please let me know and I'll avoid it in the future.

* halakha: Jewish law.
* mitzvot (sing.: mitzvah): Literally ""commandments"".
* minhagim (sing: minhag): ""Customs"". Something that's a common Jewish practice, but isn't a requirement, such as the practice of observing yahrzeit, the anniversary of your family member's death.
* kashrut: Relating to kosher dietary laws; ""kosherness"".
* frum: ""Observant"". You usually only hear this term applied to Orthodox Jews.
* daven: Pray.
* Shabbos/Shabbat: The Sabbath, which starts at sundown Friday evening.

If you've already yawned reading that last sentence, this post probably won't interest you. 

I ended up at last night's siyum by a total fluke, having been invited Tuesday night when someone was kind enough to offer me the ticket of a relative who couldn't make it. I haven't finished Shas (I haven't even been frum for seven-and-a-half years, let alone doing the daf), so much of the enthusiasm and praise for that process didn't resonate with me. While I was happy for all those around me who had made their siyum, I definitely wasn't clapping or singing as loudly as some of them. The speakers were good (R' Frand especially), but I was extraordinarily disappointed at having to leave before R' Lau spoke. For those of you unaware, the program ran long and R' Lau's speech took place after the last train back to Manhattan, so anyone who didn't drive in had to leave early.

What I didn't realize was that having to take the train back early afforded me the opportunity for a truly moving experience, definitely the highlight of my night. As our train car filled up, a few of the men started organizing a minyan. I had davened inside the stadium with a few people who were also leaving early, so I stayed in my seat. The group was as mixed as you can get: chassidim, yeshivish guys, one or two MO fathers and a few YU guys, even a couple young men who might have been conservative (maybe Israelis or *very* LWMO, didn't ask). It was extraordinarily moving to watch them all daven together on this train, some reading from pocket siddurim, some from cell phones, one or two with their eyes closed davening from memory. You could hear when someone davened a different nusach then someone else, you could even hear the one yekkish guy mutter ""yisbarakh"" with the chazzan during a kaddish. It was only about fifteen men, with another ten or so of us in the train car (women and a few other men who had davened already). We pulled out of the station at the start of the prayer, and the ride was almost bizarre; the clacking of the wheels punctuated the prayer, and the rocking of the train amplified the shuckeling, with the rest of us sitting in silence, sometimes responding to an ""amen"" or ""bri khu.""

This was very moving as it was, but something special happened for me which sealed the deal. I was traveling alone, and a larger-than-life chassid sat down in the seat next to me. He was about 6'2"" or 6'3"", in his 50s, and had a long, thick beard. He smiled at me when he sat down, asked how I found the siyum, commiserated on the misfortune of missing R' Lau's speech. He too had davened previously, and when the other men began to pray we both sat quietly and watched. About halfway through I glanced at him, and noticed that he was crying. He caught my eye, smiled and said, ""Just look at our people."" 

We didn't speak the rest of the trip, and went separate ways at Secaucus junction. But I can't get his words out of my mind. Everyone on that train recognized that this was an incredible moment of achdus, but to see a man who must have davened maariv thousands of times in his life weep openly from this simple prayer... It was like watching hashem reach into his heart. That man will stick with me more than any of the roshei yeshiva or video tributes from the siyum.

And now my polite request. I mentioned it somewhere else on this subreddit, but if anyone comes into some footage of R' Lau's speech (I'm looking at you, anyone with an AIA connection) or spots it on the web, I would genuinely appreciate the opportunity to hear what he had to say. Thanks in advance to anyone who can help me out with this. And if anyone else would like to share a moment from any of the myriad siyums that happened around the world last night, I'd love to hear it.",,False,self,t5_2qi67,False,,,True,t3_xkw0h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/xkw0h/my_siyum_experience_and_a_polite_request/,

-Do Jews believe in humans being saved? In other words, is redemption necessary for us to go to heaven?

-Can you go to heaven by being a ""moral"" person.

I have been discussing this a bit with my roommate who is Jewish, but what is the point of the Jewish religion if it comes down to morality? I say this because Christian missionaries are spreading the word of God and the ""point"", I guess is for them to help people understand that acceptance in Jesus Christ is the only way to heaven. It is not just being moral per se. 

- Also, I am asking because again I know very little about the topic, but what about Jesus leads Jewish people to not believe he is the messiah? Also, could someone explain a little more deeply what the Jewish messiah is characterized by/will do? ShamanSTK stated that the Jewish messiah is not a miracle worker, or a prophet, and certainly not God (also, I noticed that the answers did not spell out God, and I'm extremely sorry if I'm being offensive if this in fact the case) then what is the messiah supposed to be? 

**FINAL EDIT**: **Thank you so much /r/judaism for answering the many questions I had and hopefully our discussion helped you with your faith, as it did mine. I think the post turned into something more than what I originally had hoped for (the topic of conversation has become a little to ""advanced"" for me haha), but again your answers were very appreciated. Thank you again!**

I made a new account for this, although now that I think about it, I greatly prefer this username to my regular one.  My dilemma is this: I was raised Orthodox, and despite my intellectual dissatisfactions as a youth, I was swept back in thanks to a combination of the pseudo-intellectual diatribes of Aish HaTorah, a deep need for meaning, and my respect for my father (himself a ""baal teshuva"").  I went to a rightwing yeshiva for several years post-high school; the rosh yeshiva is a tremendous intellect and shockingly open minded, despite being a longtime student of R' Moshe Shapiro.  I really enjoy the intellectual exercise of learning, and as a youth, I longed to think that there was a ""right"" path.

But after leaving yeshiva, I began to become more aware of (1) the startling diversity in opinions concerning hashgachic matters; (2) the complete lack of intelligible principles for applying halacha; and (3) how many of the things that I prayed for were things that I find anathema (the return of animal sacrifice, theological monarchy, killing homosexuals, banning free discussion, etc.).  Many of the biblical narratives began to grate on me.  And as time progresses, I find that I'm no longer able to ignore the lack of evidence for biblical integrity, much less evidence for the existence of God.

I am ostensibly part of the Orthodox community because I find it to have many wonderful facets, especially the support network that it provides.  I have a deep respect for our tradition of thoughtful moralizing and intellectual rigor.  I utterly detest the rightwing ideology that disallows discourse and pretends to have a monopoly on truth, but I don't have a pony in the race, as it were - I can argue against the positions espoused by many on the right, but I find the counter positions to be just as untenable.  I see comments by many in the blogosphere attacking the ahistorical lunacy of YWN or cross-currents, but ultimately, I find the extension of those arguments to lead to an anti-religious perspective; I often wonder if the authors ignore the logical conclusions of their own arguments in order to retain legitimacy.

I'm posting here because I'm hoping for discussion, not to rant against any vision of truth.  I know myself enough to know that I'll never be comfortable breaking Shabbos or some loose definition of kosher, but that is a result of habit, not intellect.

I am a man without an intellectual community, despite having a wonderful physical one.  Am I a hypocrite?  A pragmatist?

Over these days the Jewish people are in a state of sever mourning over the destruction of the beit hamikdash and our holy city of Jerusalem.

We do not eat meat, we do not listen to music, most Ashkenazim may no longer shower in warm water, etc.

We are taught that this terrible destruction and period of mourning was brought about by Sinat Chinam, baseless hatred.  This is and has always been a very difficult mida of the Jewish people and something we have always had to work hard to avoid.  Just because we disagree with someone does not mean we need to undermine them or fight with them.

Today, just like always in Galut, there are many forces that cause rifts between us.  Its important to take the time and realize how insignificant most of them are, and how insignificant they are compared to the fact that we no longer have our temple.

It is said that in every generation that the Beit Hamikdash (The Holy Temple) is not rebuilt, it is as if it was destroyed in their very generation, since they did not merit it's existence.

May we all use this time for the best, through deep introspection and careful work, we may all come to the greatest heights, and hopefully merit the full redemption with the coming of our holy Moshiach. (G-d's anointed king).

Also wishing everyone an easy and meaningful fast next week on Tisha B'av.

As a Reconstructionist Jew, I definitely feel alienated reading this subreddit, especially when I have to browse the glossary everytime someone makes a text-based post. In that interest, I decided to take one of the mods' advice and create content more relevant to less observant Jews. I encourage other denominations to do likewise!

Second, I am by no means nor definitions an expert on Reconstruction Judaism. I'm just a random internet passerby taking a mods' advice and trying to stimulate more inclusive discussion!

So, getting into the meat of it: What does it mean to be a Reconstructionist Jew? Well, my rabbi puts it like this, ""When you move into your parent's house there will be things you do away with, things you keep and things you bring in.""

That's the short answer. The long answer is that Reconstructionism is about finding a happy medium between ancient culture, identity, tradition and practices, and modern limitations and new possibilities. One good example, what do we consider working on Shabbat? I certainly don't consider playing a few video games working. However another member of my Synagogue actively removes personal electronics from his house every Friday and takes them back in Saturday evening. 

So as a Reconstructionist, who is correct? We both are. For me, electronics help me relax, reflect and study. For my friend, they represent his work and strife during the week. 

Thank you for reading this! If you have any questions about Reconstructionism, I won't even begin to call myself an expert, but I'll try my best to provide answers.

I am 27 and raised in a Muslim family and around me nearly everyone hated Jews and expected me to do the same thing and i don't like doing things without reason. so i wanted to find out. and everyone keeps bringing up Palestine and there are so many angles to that story i don't even know but the images on the news (guns vs stones) doesn't help the jews much. but i like most of you know actions and words of a government are far from the people's that it governs. 

so i did a little research i read about the Ashkenazi Jews and stuff like Antisemitism which is really sad. and the poor Jewish people have always been hunted, accused of stuff and hated and driven out of where ever they were. i mean from what i read i was so saddened they had like the hardest life on this world, like they didn't belong on this planet and always unaccepted and disrespected yet they lived and persevered. i really respect that cause i can really relate to it. i have lived in 8 different countries in my life so far and am never accepted in any even my own and have yet to find a home. 

now what i see is that the Jews are united people and that is rare in the human species and something to be respected. but why people have so much hate for them. to me they have awesome food they are funny people and enjoy life, they are united, they respect family, they have honor and respect in a household. they have rules and culture. 

 i have no reason to hate. i actually like them after all i read. and finding out most of my Favorite comedians are Jewish. so maybe you can tell me why have they been hated so much cause its not just some people. it's alot of people throughout history!

I have but one question to my Jewish cousins. How do Jewish people pray and in what way do they view God and what is their relationship with God? I know that Chrsitians see God as a sort of trinity and use saints or intermediaries while us Muslims reject such concepts. I know that Christians pray before bed sometimes and pray in a church during communion, mass, and confession while Muslims kneel down five times a day. But what I never learned is how Jewish people pray before God. Is it in any way similar to the Islamic way of praying or are there different rites and rituals performed? 

One last question is what is the purpose, history, and rituals of a Bar Mitzvah? A part of me wanted to research this online but I may as well hear from those of the actual belief rather than third party sources.

The shacharit service starts, effectively, with the story of the Akeidah (binding of Issac.) The shacarit service ends, effectively, with the Aleynu prayer - which was said by Joshua when the Jews crossed the Jordan river to take Israel. 

In between the Akeidah and the Aleynu, we have the Song of the Sea, the Torah reading (on Mon/Thurs) and several other things which make it clear that the Men of the Great Assembly were effectively structuring the morning service to be a complete retelling of the history of the Jewish people.  Pretty cool? 

Ok. One more...

When Hashem is about to give the Jews the Torah, the Jews strike gold by saying the most critical thing we could say as a people: We will do and we will hear.  Why the strange order? Well, there have been books written on that topic but to sum it up, it essentially tell us that we will obey first and try to understand later.  Ok, no biggie. 

Here's the cool part that I noticed...

If you go into the Ashrei prayer, and scroll down to Resh (every line is alphabetical - Aleph, Beis, Gimel, etc.) you'll find something particularly cool. 

King David comes to tell us (multiple times per day, no less) that Hashem will do, and He will hear - in the exact same order with the exact same words! 

R'-tzon y'-rei-av YA-A-SEH - v'-et sha-va-tam YISH-MAH v'-yo-shi-eim.

The will of those who fear him, He will do, and He will hear their cry and save them. 

Ok. Those are mine. What have you got?

There are many practices in ancient Judaism that either are no longer practiced at all, or are only done in a symbolic manner - instead of slaughtering a lamb, we buy a shank bone for the Seder plate, for example. We don't perform animal sacrifice anymore, either.

Has anyone ever proposed changing circumcision to a symbolic activity? Hold a bris, but instead of cutting the infant boy, instead just put a ribbon around his wrist or something - or at the very least, just give him a little nick rather than cutting off his foreskin?

I value being Jewish, but when I have a son, I frankly don't want to risk horrible complications for a medically unnecessary procedure - and I don't think I have the right to make an irreversible decision like circumcision for someone else.

I'm going through an identity crisis here. I'm a 16 year old guy, and was born and raised a Conservative Jew in one of the most Jewish towns in the US. Judaism is a huge part of my life - I'm a very active member of USY, always promote Israel, can read Hebrew very well, have a ton of Jewish friends, and I'm in love with a Jewish girl. 

Over the past few years though, as I've been exposed to more math, logic, and science, I've become extremely skeptical of the actual religious aspect. I just can't believe in the God described in the Torah and other texts, or any god at all. When I go to synagogue I feel such a deep connection, but it's not to God - it's to the other people there, the emotions, the community, the prayers. I even lead services every once in a while.

I don't think I can return to believing in God, but I want to know: is it possible to reconcile my love of the Jewish culture with my atheism? It's been such a huge source of stress to me, having to keep my beliefs hidden from my family and some of my friends in order to not lose them. I feel like most of them would be accepting of me and nothing would change; the problem lies in the few who would be unpredictable, or would definitely react negatively (including both of my parents).

What can I do?

I am hoping that I can get some help here that would somehow help reduce this stress.

I am afraid that what I am going to say may sound offensive to readers in this forum because to ask my question, I must express what goes on in me. But all I am saying is ""This is what goes on in me"". Despite what I currently think, I also believe that if I had happened to have been brought up in a different family, my brain might be so different at such a deep level, that I would have ended up a firm believer. 

My wife was brought up in a strongly religious household and was a strong believer when young. As an adult, she gradually came to not believe in a ""personal"" God. I think it may be approprite to call her an atheist in a very real sense, and she doesn't disagree, but she still has a deep feeling for the Jewish traditions and a deep need to attend Passover seders, etc.

I, on the other hand, was brought up in a non-religiously-serious, nominally Christian home, and always was a non-believer. As an adult (I'm 56), my lack of belief has been strengthened by such things as the fact that I see no reason to assume the theory of evolution doesn't explain our human form, etc.

On the other hand, I am extremely certain that what science (CURRENTLY) understands is only a small part of the whole. The main thing is the question of consciousness. Human beings are aware and have experience. No computer or machine, no matter how complex, is aware AT ALL or has experiences AT ALL. And I am in a good position to say that, because I have personally contributed a small bit to the field of ""artificial intelligence"" -- some of my ideas on how to automatically distinguish spam emails from wanted emails using mathematical formulas have been incorporated into a number of widely-used email spam filters.

I just don't believe that the concept of God provides any answers that help explain why we are here. One reason is the simple conundrum: if the Universe couldn't have existed without a God to create it, then why could a God capable of creating the universe have existed without another God to create that one? Argument such as ""God exists outside of time"" do nothing for me. (To address that particular argument, current scientific thinking is that time came into being with the universe, so WHATEVER factors led to the creation of the Universe ""existed outside of time"". 

We simply don't know what those factors were, and may not even have brains capable of understanding them.

And I am perfectly fine saying ""I don't have any idea how the universe came about"". I don't feel a need to assume any particular answer that has come down to us through any particular religious tradition is correct, especially since so many cultures have created their own religious traditions that contradict those of other traditions, every tradition having many people who are absolutely convinced that their answer is the one and only true one.

But again, I do not represent a version of atheism that insists we have all or most of the answers. (I don't think many, or perhaps any, intelligent atheists do think that, actually.)

And I can even imagine calling ""the factors that led to the creation of the universe"" by the name God. To me, that would just be giving those factors a name.

But what I am completely unable to do is believe that there is a conscious, reasoning, communicating God as depicted in either the Hebrew or Christian Bible, or the holy books of any other ancient religion, Who etched commandments on a tablet, told the Jews to kill all the Canaanites, or caused all the first-born Egyptian males to die during Passover. They seem so extremely unlikely to me, that I think it makes more sense to call me an atheist than an agnostic.

(Again, this is all with the caveat that at some very level, I also think that if I happened to have been born into a very different family, I might have ended up believing exactly that. But that ""I"" wouldn't really be the ""me"" that I in fact am!)

Now my problem.

My wife deeply needs to attend seders. And she feels extremely hurt and offended if I do not accompany her. The problem is that I feel extremely hypocritical sitting at the Seder table, participating in a tradition that begins: ""Blessed are You, G-d, our G-d, King of the universe, who has chosen us from among all people, and raised us above all tongues, and made us holy through His commandments."" I simply cannot believe that that actually happened, or that there is a enough of a chance that it did that I could be labeled anything but an atheist with respect to such assertions. 

But in addition to that, I feel that the human race needs to QUICKLY get to a point where each group of people no longer feels it is special and separate and more knowledgeable about ultimate truth than other peoples, or much of humanity will probably soon be destroyed by nuclear and/or biological and/or other kinds of weapons. So I find myself profoundly uncomfortable with those aspects of the Seder.

The upshot is that I don't see how I can participate in saying the words, or holding the wine at various points, etc. I have tried to participate in the past, and each year that I do I have come to feel more and more strongly that I am being a hypocrite when I do so. And I don't think the other Seder participants would want me there if they knew I was feeling that way. And I don't want to feel that way. But I also don't want to make my wife miserable and stress our relationship in the major ways that it does when I simply stay home and she goes alone.

I have, many times, tried to explain my feeling about all this to my wife, but somehow it doesn't seem to make much difference to her. I am perfectly happy for her to attend and have an experience that is meaningful to her, I just haven't been able to do so myself without  increasingly feeling like a hypocrite. 

This year, she signed us up to attend a Chabad seder. To avoid marital stress, I told her I'd go if she asked someone whether it would be OK for an atheist to attend and to avoid doing or saying things he wasn't comfortable doing.

She got the Rabbi's wife on the phonem and told her I that I am ""not Jewish"" but ""am interested."" And the Rabbi's wife told her I wouldn't have to do anything I didn't want to. 

But I don't think my wife accurately presented the situation to the Rabbi's wife, and I find it difficult to believe that that would really mean that she (or the Rabbi, or other participants), would actually be able to live with me just sitting there as not only a non-Jew, but an atheist who is deeply uncomfortable with some aspects of the Seder, not doing any of the things the other people at the table are doing.

All this has created a situation that seems impossible to me. But maybe I'm wrong, and the Chabad community could really accept me sitting there and not participating at all. Or maybe they could accept me sitting there and participating only with respect to any portions that are consistent with a reading of ""God"" as meaning ""whatever unknown factors led tot he creation of the universe.""

Again, I deeply hope readers of this question are not offended. I do not mean to offend, and again, I certainly don't have a basis to think I have any answers, since I believe I would probably be a believer if I happened to have been raised in a different household. I just am unable to be someone other than who I am, and I have a real problem, and I don't know where else to go for help. Hopefully others in similar situations could also be helped by any suggestions!

Many thanks in advance for any thoughts anyone chooses to share.


**UPDATE:** I want to thank everyone in this community who responded. The vast majority of responses have been extremely valuable. I am extremely heartened by the viewpoint that people here wouldn't condemn me for taking part in the seder even without being a believer. It makes me feel that it's likely that the other people attending the seder would also be able to live with me being as I am and still participating.

A few people said I was over-thinking it. I've been accused of that before with respect to other things. :)  It's the way I am. It does have certain advantages, but it definitely has disadvantages too.

I think I can safely say that the Reddit/Judaism community has helped my marriage. :)  Thank you SO much.

So I have a question for all of you Jews out there. I am someone who is technically Jewish.

So, for any out there who may have been in a similar situation, or just for those of you who are knowledgeable about Judaism, how can I find out more about Judaism, in aspects both cultural and religious?

**The day before:** (today)

You are supposed to try and give some charity today if/when possible. Ask others for forgiveness, for things you know about, and for things you don't know about. Eat. Not only is eating/drinking recommended, it is a mitzvah to do so today.

It is recommended for men to go to the mikveh today.

Most people try and do [Tashlich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tashlikh) by today, but you can do it as late as Hoshana Rabbah.

**The day of**

*The five forbidden things.*

1. No eating and/or drinking. If you have a medical need or are nursing/pregnant, consult a competent Rabbi. None of us on /r/Judaism are able to guide you if you have such a need. It is better that you do not go to shul than break the fast.

2. No leather shoes. This only applies to shoes. Leather belts, kippahs, other stuff are totally fine. Also, don't make the same mistake I did. Suede is leather. I wore suede shoes for a few years until last year when my wife pointed out that I am indeed an idiot. If you don't have non-leather shoes, you are allowed to daven with only socks.

3. No bathing or washing. This refers to such activities for pleasure. You can wash your hands for hygienic reasons (bathroom, dirt, etc). But when you do so, only the bare minimum required, which is usually up to the knuckles. Showering can be done before Yom Kippur, so there is no reason to have a bath/shower on Yom Kippur, even for hygiene. 

4. No anointing yourself with perfumes or lotions. This includes deodorant. According to my Rabbi, this also includes spray deodorant. No moisturizers, no fancy soaps.

5. No marital relations. I hope this is simple enough.

*In shul*

Many married men wear a [kittel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittel). I do, even if it does make me look like an over sized marshmallow.

There are five prayers across the day. This is compared to the usual three for a weekday, or four on Shabbos/Holiday. The extra one is Neilah, which is the last prayer of Yom Kippur.

There is nothing wrong with bringing something to read. The day is long, tiring, and can get boring. I usually bring some essays about Yom Kippur/Succos to read. 

If you can get to a store, I HEAVILY suggest [Pathway To Prayer](http://www.amazon.com/Pathway-Prayer-Translation-Explanation-ArtScroll/dp/1578194695/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1348579351&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=pathway+to+prayer). It has vastly improved my Rosh Hashana/Yom Kippur experience.

**After Yom Kippur**

Enjoy bagels and lox.

Its great to be back again!

About a year ago I was at an archaeological dig in Perak (Malaysia) with Prof. Mokhtar from Universiti Sans Malaysia (USM). He and his team have been uncovering stone axes with confirmed dates of a whopping 1.8 million years! Here is a [link](http://arkeologis.wordpress.com/2009/02/24/latest-archaeological-discovery-in-malaysia/) to an article about the archaeological find.

Being a practicing Muslim and knowing Prof. Mokhtar to be an even more devout Muslim than myself, I was curious to know how Prof. Mokhtar reconciled the scientific data with his religious beliefs. His answer took me totally by surprise.

He explained that there is an obscure Hadith in Sunni Islam about there having been more than one Prophet Adam, that there were other Prophet Adams before the one which we commonly think of. He explained that the Prophet Adam which we usually think of was the first Prophet sent to the homo-sapiens and that the previous Adams were sent to the various proto-human species. Apparently, in the Shi'a school of Islam, there are several Hadiths testifying to this and these Shi'a Hadiths specifically mention there having been ten (10) previous Prophet Adam.

I have tried asking about this in r/Islam; but the post didn't generate terribly much interest. Furthermore, the specific book of Hadiths containing the ahadith I'm interested in is only available in Arabic (which I don't understand).

In lieu of the similarities between Judaism and Islam; I was wondering if there might be some Jewish texts which might reference there having been previous or multiple Prophet Adams? A fellow redditor said something about ""Midrash"" as a possible source.

Can anyone shed some light on this?",,False,self,t5_2qi67,False,,,True,t3_lgao4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/lgao4/from_rislam_question_about_prophet_adam/,

1368483570.0,21,self.Judaism,1e9vi0,Muslim here with a question about animal sacrifice in Judaism,Doctor_Yi,21,0,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1e9vi0/muslim_here_with_a_question_about_animal/,"Shalom Aleichem, fellow monotheists,

I had a question inspired by a post by a Christian posting in /r/islam encouraging us to accept Jesus, peace be upon him, as our lord and savior and all that. In his post, he wrote:

&gt;In Islam you say that Allah is all merciful. In Christianity they say that they are saved by grace. In Judaism they sacrifice animals with the faith that their sins are being taken away, and God either accepts the sacrifice or doesn't. The only difference between the Jewish and Christian forms of sacrifice is that Christians believe that God himself became the sacrifice dealing with sin once and for all, while the Jews must continue sacrificing to maintain righteousness. The concept of Jesus' sacrifice is actually based on the Jewish sacrificial system on Yom Kippur.

I'm no expert on the Bible and Tanakh, but I did some research and found some pieces of scripture that seemed to disagree with his idea that sins are only forgiven in Judaism through animal sacrifice, such as:

&gt;

&gt;“To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifice unto Me?, saith the Lord. I am full of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lamb or of he-goats.” Isaiah 1:11

&gt;“Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High” Psalms 50:13-14

&gt;""I desired not sacrifices; I commanded not your fathers, when I stretched forth my hand to bring them out of Egypt, to offer burnt -- offerings to me, but only to obey my voice.” Jeremiah 7:21-22

This gave me the idea that in your religion, forgiveness is obtained in the same way as it is in mine; prayer. I ask y'all then, what is the role of animal sacrifice in Judaism? Why are animals sacrificed, and what role does sacrifice have in the forgiveness of sins? Am I mistaken, or can sins be forgiven just as easily as they are in Islam. I apologize if I offended anybody if anything I said was ignorant, but to be honest I'm no expert on the matter.

I may be out of bounds here, but that's fine, there's a downvote button to tell me that :). 

It seems that many people have a fear/aversion to asking questions because they feel that they do not know enough or are looked down upon, and therefore cannot contribute to the discussion.

As someone who grew up in the Orthodox world, yet somehow made it through day school with enormous gaps in my knowledge, I would like to tell you that questions are the way to keep conversation going. Here are just a few points that I would like to bring up.

* Your lack of knowledge does *not* indicate a lesser status as a person or as a Jew. No one should ever look down at you and say that you are somehow worse because of a lack of a knowledge base.
* If you don't understand a term or phrase, ask. Often there are a dozen other people reading that would benefit from a thorough response (including, often, the person who responds). 
* Just because someone believes that you have a different legal standing in Judaism, does not mean that you are a lesser person to them, or that you are not allowed to participate in the discussion. Yes, the issue of who is a Jew can be painful, and if not handled properly, exclusionary. But I personally do not think that anyone participating in this subreddit actually wants you to somehow feel bad about that or does not want to discuss with you as a result. We are all people, and we can all learn from each other through thoughtful conversation. 
* Just because you have an different view, doesn't mean that you shouldn't contribute it. You may feel some form of resistance, but that is often just the way we hammer out details and form fully defensible opinions and have informative discussion. This is especially true for those of us coming from the Orthodox world, who likely grew up with a Talmudic background, in which the only way to find the true answer is to attack it from all possible angles, and if it still stands, wonderful. Just because someone doesn't agree with your opinion doesn't mean that the conversation is not mutually beneficial in some way.

IANAR, nor do I play one on TV. I do not represent the opinions of all contributors to this subreddit, nor even those of the Orthodox contingency. These are my opinions, and I just wanted to put them out there, as it pains me to see people feeling left out and hurt because of misunderstandings in comment threads. Words can hurt, and it is unfortunately very easy to misconstrue intent, especially with preconceived notions and comments written with no way of showing inflection. 

I hope my rambling wall of text made sense, and that it will help those who have felt left out or unqualified in some manner feel comfortable contributing.

Recently, I have been seeing activity increase a lot.  This is fantastic.  A lot of new regulars, and a lot of new ""post once in a while people"".  When the project was created, we had around a quarter of the users (Somewhere is a screen cap of 613 users)  I encourage everybody of all backgrounds to sign up for a Dvar Torah.  It is a little way to spread some Judaism around the world.  We can share with each other what we feel is important to each of us.  Secular to yeshiva bochur, you are all welcome, and encouraged to sign up for one.

On another note; what can I do, what can we do, to make this place better?  I lot of the things I have done, we have done a lot as a community.  A lot of it was with your input.  Each of the r/Judaism resources was done by the community.  The various links on the sidebar was vetted by the community.  What else can we do around here to make this as welcome and interesting place as possible?

He realized immediately that it could be an early warning sign and that there may be a problem that necessitated further exploration. He was admitted to the hospital and will be undergoing bypass surgery tomorrow morning (**Rav Reuven Shmuel ben Yitta** for those willing to pray for him). Today from his hospital room he sent out an email with the following message that was entitled [The Fantasy of Immortality](https://docs.google.com/open?id=1l2QkJD2_4VcmZL9dWE9yVzZu1_ngGIloFRN7-Z5qL7dDpzLDj6ziq-K1tye9): 

*This week’s parsha, Emor, begins with the special laws and restrictions that pertain to Kohanim, who alone are mandated to perform the Temple service.  The first subject taken up is that of Tumat Meit (defilement by contact with a corpse).  A Kohen may not visit a cemetery or enter a building in which there is a “meit”.  This rule applies to all dead bodies except for his seven close relatives.  In these cases the law is that he must forgo his state of purity and become impure by attending the funeral of his family members.*  

*At first glance the prohibition of assisting in the burial of the dead is not easy to comprehend.  There are few mitzvot as significant as honoring the deceased by eulogizing, escorting the coffin and participating in the burial.  The purpose of Kavod Hameit  is to affirm that man is unique because he was created in the Divine Image.  One who disparages the dead or refrains from according them honor thereby expresses that they are mere flesh and bones with no higher dimension.  He thus denies creation and the Creator and affirms a purely materialistic concept of life.  Moreover, participation in a funeral has a beneficial and sobering effect on people.  For, one of the greatest obstacles to perfection is the “fantasy of immortality.”  It is part of human nature to be incapable of imagining our own demise.  We take it for granted that we will go on indefinitely and this emotion stands in the way of our perfection.  We waste a great deal of time on superficial and trivial pursuits and do not invest sufficient energy in obtaining wisdom and improving our middot because we don’t sense the urgency to do so.  As long as things are going well for a person he is disinclined to consider that life is short and the work of perfecting oneself is great.  It is only when he encounters loss and tragedy that the temporal nature of life sinks in.  The death of a friend or acquaintance breaks through the illusion of immortality.  It reminds a person that he is no different than the niftar (deceased) and that his time is limited and if he is wise he will begin, immediately, to put it to good use.  Thus the question remains, why are the Kohanim who are dedicated to Hashem’s service forbidden to be in contact with a meit?* 

*The primary role of the Kohen is to dedicate himself to the study of Torah and to teaching it to the Jewish people.  As the verse states, “The Kohain’s lips should preserve knowledge and they (the Jews) should seek Torah from his mouth.”  (Malachai 2:7)  Their primary vocation of being fully immersed in the study and dissemination of Torah is what qualifies them to perform the service in the Beit Hamikdosh.  We can therefore understand why the Kohain is proscribed from attending funerals.  His basic mission is to be involved in matters of eternal value.  He is not caught up in the fantasies and vain pursuits of ordinary people and therefore does not require contact with death to “bring him to his senses.”  The holiness of the Kohain consists in the fact that his life is dedicated to Torah and the service of Hashem.  The crown of the Kohain is available to all Jews.  It requires that we voluntarily dedicate ourselves to Torah, good deeds and the perfection of our character traits.  May we merit to attain this.*

I am in the process of learning about Reform Judaism. I recently spoke with an Orthodox rabbi who explained to me that it would be better for someone to remain a Righteous Gentile than to convert to (Reform) Judaism.

I asked him whether or not he considers Reform Jews Jewish. He said, ""No."" 

I then asked, ""If you don't believe Reform Jews are Jewish, does that mean their only mandate is to follow the Noahide Laws (even if they are performing other mitzvot)?"" He said, ""Yes.""

So, in essence he (seemed to) believes that Reform Jews are just living as Righteous Gentiles.

It was my first encounter with an Orthodox Jew (and rabbi, no less) and it was really interesting to get his perspective. The conversation was pretty short, so I just thought I'd put this out there and see what other Orthodox Jews believe on this subject. Does the rabbi's perspective match up with your own? I am just interested in whether or not any perspectives were left out. The answers were quite simple. Is there anything you would add to complicate or provide shades of meaning to the conversation?

Additionally, if you are Reform (or Conservative), what might you have said in response to the Orthodox rabbi? What are your thoughts on the issue?

I'm looking forward to seeing this discussion unfold and hopefully gain more insights into some of the nuances of this debate.

Y. Yerushalmi's ZACHOR for a discussion of Jewish attitude toward
history.  My focus is American Jewish history.

4Cubits: For the major influences upon postwar Jewry, see my AMERICAN
JUDAISM, CHAPTER 6.  Trends that might change American Judaism include
intermarriage and the low birthrate of all but Orthodox Jews.  It is
hard to imagine that significant numbers of Jews would leave the US
for Israel, but were America's government to be overthrown and
replaced with a dictator that could happen; likewise if (as seems
almost impossible) there were to be a government that persecuted Jews.
 Always wise for Jews to be vigilant about antisemitism, but US is
probably the least antisemitic diaspora country today.  As for changes
at Brandeis University since you left:  lots of new buildings, a new
president, and much more student interest in courses and majors that
they feel can lead to remunerative employment.

BubbaMetzia:  The urban riots may well have been the death knell for
some urban Jewish communities, and they also heightened tensions
between Blacks and Jews.  But (as article in Journal of American
History by L.Corwin Berman showed this year) even Jews who left urban
areas, like Detroit, continued to care about those cities.    Re
intermarriage:  it began to rise steeply  in 1960s at the same time
that Americans of all kinds began to marry across religions and races.
Certainly, the fact that Jews live closer to non-Jews and in less
densely Jewish neighborhoods is highly significant. FOr more
discussion, see AMERICAN JUDAISM, pp.360-64.

namer98 - Baal teshuva movement drew some of the more serious Jews in
the Conservative Movement to Orthodoxy, but I do not think that it is
crucial variable in that movement's decline.  As America polarized,
religiously centrist movements all fell into decline (the Protestant
ones too). RCA had accepted stationary microphones and Baltimore's
Beth Tfillah put one in, but Rabbi Soloveitchik only agreed to become
rabbinic authority for RCA if it reversed that ruling.  Nowadays, an
organization in Israel named Tzomet has designed a microphone system
that many Orthodox leaders are willing to accept. Hasidic Jews differ
from Haredi Jews in their approach to study and to spirituality; they
also dress differently and view their rabbis differently.  For other
differences (even demographic ones), see the new New York Jewish
Population Survey which distinguishes the groups from one another.  My
interest in American Jewish history developed in high school.  I am a
first generation American from a scholarly Jewish family and this was
a wide open field.    I am hoping to write a new chapter covering
developments in American Judaism since 2004.  Have not titled it yet.
  I only know of one woman privately ordained in Germany -- Regina
Jonas.  There were no Reform private ordinations at that time in US,
and the US Reform decision (as a group) preceded that of other
countries in ordaining women.     Influence of R. Samson R. Hirsch on
US Jewry deserves a full-scale study:  different movements within
Orthodoxy view Hirsch differently, including his attitude toward
modernity.  German, Lithuanian and Middle East Jews all influenced
Modern Judaism; I would not know how to weigh their respective
influences (differ by person and by synagogue). I deal a bit with
future trends in American Jewish life in conclusion of American
Judaism.

Louis_Farizee - Postwar American Jews felt responsible for world
Jewry.  Cold war meant that helping Soviet Jews was also patriotic.
The sense that American Jewry did not do enough in 193-s and 40s was
also a motivation for some.  Beckerman and others show that JDL
greatly declined after it injured innocent civilians (and Jews) in its
bombings. While JDL played a role in early Soviet Jewry movement, it
was not a significant factor later on in my view.

heres_a_llama - Impossible to compare 1825 (when two largest Jewish
communities were Charleston &amp; NY and they differed) with situation
today.  New York is exceptional because density of Jews is so much
greater in NY:  only in NY can secular Jews absorb something of a
Jewish atmosphere from their neighbors (as happens in Israel), and
only in NY do Jews have such a strong sense of numbers in many
neighborhoods as to feel empowered.  Both Southern Judaism and Western
Judaism are different in many ways, from Judaism in East, but there
are actually differences from city to city - contrast, for example,
San Francisco and LA or Miami and Memphis.    In terms of Conservative
movement:  it does face challenges, but so did Orthodoxy in 1950s and
Reform in 1930s, and both of those movements recovered. Issue for
Conservative movement at this point is that it has fewer children
(whether it indoctrinates them or not) than either Orthodoxy or
Reform.  So it will need to lure people away from other movements --
which good synagogues can do!

elizabethraine - Converts should keep in mind that Judaism is not only
a different religion from Christianity, Judaism is also the religion
of a whole people.  By converting to Judaism a convert suddenly takes
upon herself Jewish relatives around the world.  In short, welcome to
the tribe!

Ninjew333 - The many movements in Judaism have strengthened Judaism in
America by creating many options. Dissatisfied Jews always have other
movements/synagogues to explore; they need not opt out.  But even
though there are many kinds of Jews there is still, in my view, a
Jewish people (just as America is very divided, but there is still an
American people).

aalorni - Many American Jews of the immigrant era read THE RISE OF
DAVID LEVINSKY and were shaped by that book.  Milton Steinberg's AS A
DRIVEN LEAF remains most inspiring.   Assimilation is always a
realistic scenario in a free society:  many Caribbean Jews assimilated
out of existence, so did Chinese Jews, so (probably) did the Lost Ten
Tribes.  You are quite right that most American Jews consider
self-identity the determinant of Judaism which is not the case in
Israel.  The Israeli chief rabbinate is not very much respected today
in America (or in Israel) but that could change if there were a
different chief rabbi.

Miragoat - small birthrates, high intermarriage rates, and declining
religious affiliation threaten Judaism today.  Jewish values do not
change, but there are certainly new traditions such as Yom Hashoah,
Israel Independence Day, Yom Yerushalayim, and other new traditions as
well.

Siecle - There was indeed talk of reconciliation between liberal Jews
and Unitarians in late 19th century.  Both groups belonged, for
example, to the Free Religious Association.  But in the end,
Unitarians remained Christian and rapprochement cooled.  See articles
on this subject by the late Prof. Benny Kraut.",,False,self,t5_2qi67,False,,andrew,True,t3_1c18a8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1c18a8/professor_sarna_answers_your_questions/,moderator

My teenage years were filled with misery and hate for Judaism,G-D &amp; my dad. All my friends were Christian and I missed out on a lot of high school functions and hanging out with friends due to Shabbat or Jewish holidays. Anyway, now that I just turned 30, I have become much closer to G-D and my religion. I started to wear tefillin in the mornings after my father told me that my life will get so much better if I pray and thank G-D. I felt that I would give it a try and my life has changed dramatically. I've had some serious issues in the past few months &amp; I have prayed to G-D &amp; somehow, some way, things have worked out. I never used to pray, I could have cared less about it and about going to synagogue on Shabbat. Just a few minutes ago I prayed for something and not 15 minutes after my prayers come to realization. It may just be a coincidence. However, it has happened more than enough to say that it is more than just luck or chance. There is something much bigger than you or I out there. Whatever you may be going through, I really recommend to at least try wearing tefillin in the mornings. See if things get better in your life. I can say for a fact that my life has changed for the better, I hope yours does as well.",,False,self,t5_2qi67,False,,,True,t3_1a22dr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Judaism/comments/1a22dr/i_think_there_really_is_a_gd/,
