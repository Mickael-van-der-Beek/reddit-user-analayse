Last week I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/findareddit/comments/1eik0y/i_had_this_idea_for_a_whattolookforina_subreddit/) post on /r/BuyItForLife and my idea about a subreddit where the users can exchange information about what is important to look for in a purchase motivated me to open /r/WhatToLookForInA . Here is part to the Mission Statement and Rules post, hoping it will get you guys interested and convince you to subscribe:

Welcome To What To Look For In A!

Instead of regurgitating principles of conduct, I'll explain how did I get the idea for this.

I am Italian, and I live in Northern Europe. When people ask me for what is a good pasta or a good pesto sauce, it is obviously impossible for me to suggest directly a product, knowing that in most cases the same thing I love home won't be available to them.

Same thing happens to me when I look at products suggested on Reddit and discover that in many cases those brands are available only in the US and Canada.

So I started instead to give and ask for tips in how to recognize a good product for a specific purpose and, especially when giving such tips, I understood that my karma went up indefinitely higher because the other person is now a micro-maven in that particular little topic. And as a receiver, I discovered that in Europe we have most of the products that people suggest on Reddit, just under another brand name or with little differences that don't matter.

WhatToLookForInA is a place where to learn how to buy things so to get you time and your money's worth.

Other two contributions you could make to the subreddit are:

- to spontaneously create a guide to purchasing a product you are an expert of. Add [Guide] at the beginning of the title of such a post.

- Propose yourself as a mentor for a specific kind of purchase. In this case you can also freely vaguely specify your location, so to give the possibility to create local shopping groups. Add [Mentor] at the beginning of the title of such a post.",,False,self,t5_2ue68,False,,,True,t3_1eurrv,http://www.reddit.com/r/GoodValue/comments/1eurrv/id_like_to_introduce_you_to_rwhattolookforina_my/,

Recently my insulated water bottle threw it's lid behind the oven to spite me and after several ill fated rescue attempts I resigned myself holding a funeral ceremony and moving on.  After the wake I decided that life was too short to just throw the bottle out so I started searching online to buy a replacement but could find nothing, even on the shady tor black market websites.

Distraught, surrounded by empty scotch bottles and staring intently at my grand pappy's revolver it occurs to me that if I plead to the creators of the bottle they may take pity on me and bless me with another lid.  As I pick myself up and go to find their customer support email I find they already have a lid replacement form!  And it's gonna be free!

So I place the order and receive the confirmation email which mentioned that they would have it shipped in 5 days.  Today, 5 days later, I have received not one but two replacement lids and a couple stickers to accompany them!

This is the first company since logitech to just flat out surprise me with much better than expected customer service for a product that I was prepared to receive none for so please excuse me for gushing.

It also will give you coupon codes, reviews, and a graph of the price history. (I just noticed that they have a wish list option that I don't use.) When you're not shopping, the bar disappears.

Basically, I keep buying ones that cost around $100, and after a year something goes wrong.

Anyway, I work from home so I'm talking about something for my home office.  Something that I can sit in (comfortably) for a full work day (with breaks and stuff obviously, but you know what I mean).

Normally I just walk into Staples and pick out a chair that feels ""comfy"", but there is this gap in the chair market where you either get a decent chair for $100, or if you want a *nice* chair it costs $500+.  If I could afford it, I would gladly drop $1000 on a fancy-pants desk chair at this point just to avoid these issues.

It doesn't matter what material it made of (leather preferred, but not required), but I want the height/back to be adjustable, and a bonus would be if the arms would move up and down.  I don't care if I can ""lean back"" in it, but that would be a bonus.

I will also be using it regularly around the house, so hopefully it's not just super loud without quality sound. I would like something that holds up in both situations ideally. 

Being a design geek, of course I've had my eye on the Jambox by Jawbone because they are beautiful. But they're crazy expensive and I've heard they don't get that loud. Loudness is a key factor, but hopefully not at the complete expense of decent sound. I love me some bass.

On the cheaper end of the spectrum is the iClarity, which is around $50, very small, and is said to get louder than the Jambox, but sacrifices some of the sound quality. 

I guess I'm just looking to see if anyone has owned a product that fits the bill or has suggestions.

Not only are they the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned (by a wide margin), they are also pretty much waterproof (marketed as water resistant, but I was standing on ice and broke through and the water didn't even penetrate to my socks, so as long as you aren't actively just standing in water up to your ankles these should get the job done). I love not having to deal with laces, it makes life so much easier, and on top of all this they are astonishingly warm. Plus, they seem really durable (at least thus far) as I have worn them almost everyday since I got them and the only tear or fraying I have is from when I was jumping over a barbed wire fence and my foot got caught on it. They also provide really good support and have a really sturdy rubber outsole which provides great gripping. So if you're looking for a casual shoe to wear around the house that you can also have the ability to take your dog to the dog park in or what have you, then I would highly, highly, recommend these bad boys.",,False,self,t5_2ue68,False,,,True,t3_199uct,http://www.reddit.com/r/GoodValue/comments/199uct/some_really_amazing_and_relatively_inexpensive/,

I was looking for a full size mattress, not foam, brand new.  Most of the thrift shops had only twin size beds for about $199.  After reading reviews, however, I decided to pick up a Signature Sleep Contour 8 inch thick mattress from Walmart, $179 with free shipping.  It's an independently sprung coil mattress.  It came to my door vacuum packed and stuffed into a sturdy nylon cylinder resembling a duffel bag.  It was hard to believe that a full-size mattress was in there.  After some pushing and shoving, i got it removed and slit the side with a razor.  Air rushed into the bag and PSSSSHHHHHT i had a mattress from the future!

Build quality appears solid, not BIFL like a $1200 serta or anything but definitely good for a few years of daily use from my estimation.  I thrifted a pillowtop cover for extra comfort and this combination makes for one of the best sleeping arrangements I have ever had.  I wake up and I'm not sore, which is great as I am a weightlifter with a history of back pain so a good night's sleep is very important to me.  It's certainly on the softer side overall so if you need a firm mattress it may not be the one for you, but for someone who sleeps on their side or stomach and prefer a softer bed it's great.

Bedframe wise I went with a platform bed, no box spring as it seemed unnecesary.  It was a walmart flat pack that took me a couple hours to get together.  It's cheap but it looks nice for now.

Overall I am extremely impressed with the value of this product and would strongly recommend it for someone looking for a new mattress on a budget.  The reviews are remarkably good too at www.walmart.com",,False,self,t5_2ue68,False,,,True,t3_17pdm6,http://www.reddit.com/r/GoodValue/comments/17pdm6/gv_review_signature_sleep_contour_mattress/,

1345746196.0,1,self.GoodValue,ypi68,[GV request] Laser printer for design student. ,hellohaley,2,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/GoodValue/comments/ypi68/gv_request_laser_printer_for_design_student/,"I posted before in BIFL, couldn't find my old thread and didn't remember finding an answer I was satisfied with enough to buy.

Preferably COLOR laser printer, as we do mostly black and white for mock ups but often do color studies as well, and having a color printer at home will alleviate the issue of finding a 24 hr print shop on those all nighters finishing projects. An all-in-one would be nice, and a scanner is a huge plus (almost mandatory), but printing is obviously the most crucial.

My main concerns are: 

1. Reliability - every printer I or my family has ever had ended up having problem after problem, error messages constantly, and generally being broken more often than working. I need something that will come through for me in my hour of need at 5am the morning before my projects are due, rather than crapping out like they always do.

2. Cost effective - the ink cartridges must have good value. Many people buy the printer and think 'oh boy that was a good price!' to find out later the ink refills cost an arm and a leg. This is a major consideration, being a student who will use a lot of ink. 

3. Customer service/warranty - I've learned over the years that with anything HP, you're gonna have a bad time. We've owned countless HP printers, and they are worth little more than scrap plastic. No one repairs them, no one is there online or on the phone to help you, the online help center never addresses your issue, etc etc etc. I'm looking for a company that not only has the gumption to sell me a printer, but the balls to stick around and offer support during the time that I use it as well. I'm afraid of buying something then being given the cold shoulder by a company or retailer and I'm stuck with yet another broken printer.

4. Connectivity - I have a mac. I would love to have a wireless/bluetooth setup, but I realize I can't have it all. If it is usb connected, I'd hope it's at least reliable and works with my computer (an is not a pc only, or pc with some really shitty mac-version software). I want something I can plug in and print, not something that installs a bunch of bloatware and shortcuts on my computer and hassles me with popups for the rest of my life.

 I'm not against buying used if it's a solid, reliable product and I'm not just buying someone else's junk that will die in a month and i'll be out of luck when no company or retailer will take it back or help me.

I know these are a lot of demands to make on something like a printer, but I have to hope that they are out there somewhere. With all the people with home offices, businesses, and freelance designers, I'd hope someone has found a printer that can do the job!

Any info is greatly appreciated, and thanks for the help!",,False,self,t5_2ue68,False,,,True,t3_ypi68,http://www.reddit.com/r/GoodValue/comments/ypi68/gv_request_laser_printer_for_design_student/,
