From the Edmonton journal

Update: The victims were employees of an armoured vehicle company. Shooter at large, but not believed to be in Hub Mall, police say. #ualberta #yeg

Update #2 - Edmonton journal
Three employees of an armoured vehicle company were shot and killed at the University of Alberta early Friday morning, Edmonton police confirm.

A fourth victim is in hospital with critical injuries, said Staff Sgt. Erik Johnson with Edmonton police southwest division.

Police were called to reports of gunshots at the University of Alberta’s Hub Mall shortly after midnight.

Three of the victims – two men and one woman – died of their injuries.

The fourth victim, also a man, was taken to hospital in critical condition, Johnson said.

The victims were employees of an armoured vehicle company, he said. He could not provide the name of the company.

Hub Mall was cleared and secured by police, he said. The shooter remained at large. Johnson said the shooter is not believed to be inside Hub Mall.

More than two dozen police vehicles, both marked and unmarked, descended on the U of A campus. Police carrying long guns could be seen outside Hub Mall, as other officers spoke to witnesses.

My half-brother (and I use that term loosely because we consider each other brothers) was the driver of the car with the four teens who were killed that night. I've woken up at night for almost a year now, crying from nightmares; I've spent nights hoping against hope that the driver who killed my brother and his friends just rots away to nothing. Obviously not a healthy thought process to have, and I realize that, but I hope that anyone who has been or is in my situation can understand why I feel the way I do.

I'm posting this because I'm not only disgusted by the fact he has his license again; I'm not only sickened by the fact that the reason he got his license back was so he can, ""get to and from work."" I'm absolutely crushed. What this says is that if you kill four teens and put another in a COMA but have to get to work it's totally fine because you can't, you know, call a cab or take the bus or ride a fucking bicycle to get there. But no, this just shows people that if you make the CHOICE to drive drunk and kill four teenagers you can get your license because you ""have to get to work.""

I chose to post this to reddit over facebook on the CTV Edmonton facebook feed because I don't want to face the people on facebook who will defend Hobulwich and his DECISION to drive. I realize there will be people who say, ''it was an accident."" No, no it really, really wasn't. He didn't just happen to stagger into his truck that night. He didn't just happen to slip and turn the key to start his truck. He didn't just happen to trip on the gas pedal and begin to drive; and when he crashed into my brother and his friends, he didn't just happen to slip and run away from the scene. He made the choice to drive. He made the decision to run.

My brother wouldn't drive drunk. He wasn't that kind of person. I love my brother with all my heart. He meant the world to me even if we didn't see each other a lot. For this..this pathetic human being to be able to drive again...I'm crushed reddit and my heart is breaking more than it can handle. I hope, well...I don't know what I hope. I just wanted to bring something to you, reddit, that most of us can agree is just an absolutely appalling decision by the judge.",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,,True,t3_z615f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/z615f/this_ladies_and_gentlemen_is_what_is_wrong_with/,

But when I was hit by a truck crossing 118th ave (in the crosswalk, with the lights), at least 4 people who weren't paramedics or police showed up, at least 2 knew first aid. You stayed with me until the ambulance showed up, and even after. The ambulance showed up quickly.

The constable who stayed with me until I got my xray was fantastic. The nurses and doctors were wonderful, helping me through a traumatic experience.

The railings on the beds in the Royal Alex emergency room should have been left up though - it's a long way down to fall out of bed.

Thank you Edmonton. I hope I can repay you the kindness one day. (Except the person who hit me. You can go fuck yourself).

But we live in a crazy unpredictable part of the country, weather-wise.

If you think your all season tires are fine for winter you need to rethink. If you do lots of winter driving **please** invest in some good winter tires.

I have a good studded set and I was fine today. There were people fishtailing, hitting the curbs, hitting the ditch, spinning out, hitting other vehicles.

Please keep this in mind. You can bitch about the city not clearing the streets. You can put as much sand as you want all over the road. When it comes down to it everyone is much safer with winter tires.

According to everyone we've talked to this isn't illegal, even though they charged an extra 60% on top of what the job was worth.

The company is called ""Asphalt Specialists"" and claimed they had an office on Ellerslie Rd. in Edmonton which I just found out is just a UPS Store. The guy in charge of the crew called himself Henry and my dad also spoke to one of the owners of the company, Alex.

My dad is elderly, a quiet guy who's worked hard his whole life, and lost about $8k when all was said and done. He feels really stupid - we understand the money is gone - I just want to find something, anything that might help other people avoid the same scam and give him a bit of closure so he can stop thinking about it.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this. And please, tell people you know that this scam is still happening often in our part of the world.",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,,True,t3_vlmhb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/vlmhb/my_parents_were_scammed_looking_for_more/,

""Public assistance requested in animal cruelty investigation

At around 1230 p.m. on Tuesday, April 23, citizens in the area of 92 Street and 114 Avenue witnessed a white pit bull dog being dragged by a rope or leash attached to the rear bumper of a pick-up. They frantically tried to stop the truck, but it fled the area. 

The Edmonton Police Service was informed, and on a hunch, officers went to an emergency vet clinic, where a white pit bull dog that matched the description provided by witnesses had been dropped off and was being treated for severe injuries. The dog is expected to survive, but has a long recovery ahead.

Police are actively investigating and are looking for the occupants of the suspect vehicle, a 1999 black DODGE RAM pick-up with AB plate of BFF-6818.

If you have any information, please contact the EPS at 780-423-4567 or #377 from a mobile phone in the Edmonton area.""",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,,True,t3_1d1233,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1d1233/i_hope_these_cruel_bastards_are_found/,

Message from the mods: ""GO OUTSIDE""

Fricken said:
&gt; No mention made of snow. Everywhere. Go Skiing, Snowboarding, Tobogganing, or Snowmobiling.

&gt; * X-country skiing maps and trail reports from the city here http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/sport_recreation/crosscountry-skiing.aspx , and Nordic Ski Club here http://www.edmontonnordic.ca/ ;
&gt; * Tobogganing info (city maintained hills) here http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/sport_recreation/tobogganing.aspx ;
&gt; * Rabbit Hill opened early just for this weekend http://www.rabbithill.com/w/index.php ;
&gt;
&gt; There are a lot of x-country ski clubs, a number of other small hills for novices, and a lot more snow related activities if none of these suit a person's interests. When in doubt, hed to Totem, rent some gear, and ask for advice on where to go.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know shit about snowmobiling though

1348506956.0,55,self.Edmonton,10efpp,Missing Person: Jarrett Bortscher - Last seen Sept 23 7pm,victra,62,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/10efpp/missing_person_jarrett_bortscher_last_seen_sept/,"http://sphotos-h.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/58727_10152124430200537_646857046_n.jpg

http://a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/340174_10152126130315006_569694656_o.jpg

Jarrett Bortscher is missing. His family doesn't know where he may have gone, and he has deleted his Facebook account and wiped his computer since anyone has seen him last. Otherwise, none of his possessions seem to be missing. His smashboards account is still here with a last activity of Sunday at 6pm. He was last seen Sunday at 7pm at his house.

He has a mental health condition called catatonia. He also has aspergers, which is on the autism spectrum.

DESCRIPTION: 5' 4"" tall; 125 pounds; blue hazel eyes; dark blonde hair; 18-years-old

It's pretty unusual for him to be missing given his seemingly strict medication schedule. I know he has a tendency to go on very long walks to random places, but nothing longer than like 8 hours that I know of. It's also strange that both his FB and computer are deleted.

He is officially listed as a missing person. Please call Edmonton City Police if you see him or hear anything about where he might be. Also Jarrett if you happen to log on and see this, call me or your family or something. We're all worried about you... 

**UPDATE:** He was last seen in walking last night in the Duggen Area. I've also added a second photo of him. 

**UPDATE 2:**

* HOTSPOTS TO LOOK FOR.
* Duggan Area
* Whyte Ave, 
* U of A area
* Legislature
* Emily Murphy park
* Hawrelak. 
* Churchill/City Hall/EPL area 
* These are his favorite spots.

It's official: our corpse flower (Amorphophallus Titanum) is in a flowering stage. Growing at a rapid rate of six inches per day, ""Putrella"" (Pew-trella) has wowed us since the tiny bud appeared at the end of February. The extraordinary flower is expected to bloom in a few short weeks and, as the world's tallest blossom, could reach a height of 10 feet. This will be first time that Western Canada has ever seen an Amorphophallus bloom.

The corpse flower is named for the stinky smell it emits to attract its pollinators -- carrion beetles. The flower only blooms for a brief 2-4 days. Seeing (and smelling) it will be a once in a life time experience that you will not want to miss. Keep tuned to our Facebook page for updates on Putrella's expected ""bloom date"".

You guys should check it out!

Looks like this has been around since June 11th.  I wasn't aware of it, so I figured it's something people here might be interested in knowing.

I had had a crappy weekend to begin with for reasons completely unrelated to reddit, and only decided to go to the meetup because I had already made the food and wanted to get rid of it. When I couldnt find you I was mostly just upset with myself because I (a) assumed that a clearer location was given and I just didnt read it properly, and then (b) felt that I had let you all down when I promised cheesecake and potato salad and then couldn't deliver. Oh, and I also brought paper plates, napkins, and plastic cutlery for everyone, because it wasnt made clear in any of the meetup threads whose responsibility that would be, and potlucks without that stuff is generally quite difficult. 

I had an anger induced headache and was dehydrated from walking around in the sun for so long, so I figued I'd sit and eat something before going home. I had already started eating when I realized that I had decorated the potato salad specifically for reddit and should maybe take some pictures before it got completely destroyed.

I stared taking other pictures... of me... of the scenery, etc because I was bored. It wasnt until I started walking home that I remembered how [the internet works](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/dmh9y/if_i_had_a_boyfriend_i_would_make_him_a_meme_cake/) and I decided that I could make a rather humorous photo-comic chronicling my day from the pictures I'd taken. By the time it started raining, it was all just icing on the karma cake. 

With the exception of the last photo, none of it was staged. That photo was actually done on Sunday shortly before i submitted to reddit. (although that's how I really felt on saturday night, but I just went straight to bed and slept the sad off). 


    
    
    

So anyway, since you all are now offering a consolation meet up, i was thinking something on the 8th or 9th? I was thinking the pourhouse because someone had suggested it for a previous meetup, but we went to wunderbar instead. So I've kind of got it in my mind that I want to go to the pourhouse. However, looking over the menu, it seems kind of expensive, so I'm open to other suggestions (I prefer something around whyte or south side).

*And* that weekend happens to coincide with my real birthday. So I can maybe take some photos to put on facebook so my mom doesnt think I'm such a loser. 

Let me know what y'all think. I'm pretty set on that date, but I'm open to a different location. Also I'd need a rough idea of who would come so I can make reservations and whatnot.

**Edit: So far I've had about 30 people indicate they'd come, and that saturday was a much better day, so I called the pourhouse but they wont reserve a section for us on a saturday, and that they could only accommodate a reservation of up to 15 anyway. I'm going to call the black dog next, but if you have any other ideas let me know.**
    
**Edit 2: I've sent the black dog an e-mail. They have a room in the basement they might reserve for us on saturday**

Edit 3: So when I called the black dog they told me to just e-mail them the details, which I did on Wednesday. I never heard back, so I e-mailed again on Saturday, and as of yet have not heard back.

Message from the mods: ""GO OUTSIDE""

Fricken said:
&gt; No mention made of snow. Everywhere. Go Skiing, Snowboarding, Tobogganing, or Snowmobiling.

kkptjr said:
&gt; * X-country skiing maps and trail reports from the city here http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/sport_recreation/crosscountry-skiing.aspx , and Nordic Ski Club here http://www.edmontonnordic.ca/ ;
&gt; * Tobogganing info (city maintained hills) here http://www.edmonton.ca/attractions_recreation/sport_recreation/tobogganing.aspx ;
&gt; * Rabbit Hill opened early just for this weekend http://www.rabbithill.com/w/index.php ;
&gt;
&gt; There are a lot of x-country ski clubs, a number of other small hills for novices, and a lot more snow related activities if none of these suit a person's interests. When in doubt, hed to Totem, rent some gear, and ask for advice on where to go.
&gt;
&gt; I don't know shit about snowmobiling though

""The End of the World"" as my friends and I have come to know it. It is just the sidewalk from an old road that sticks out ~15 feet from the ground. Some kind of greasy kids there sometimes but the view is almost unmatched in the city.

Me, I like the High Level Diner. The food isn't the best I've had, but the staff are generally pretty nice to me. I like the Blue Plate Diner too. Probably my favourite is Dadeo's for it's po'boys, ambience, and music.

Edit: This post is selfish too, where are your favorite restaurants located? For mine, Dadeo's is on Whyte, Blue Plate Diner is just off of Jasper, and High Level Diner is on the University side of the High Level Bridge.

I didn't know him, very few people did. I only saw him once in my life. 

He was at a bboy cypher in Churchill Square, on a cold Thursday evening. No one seemed to know him, he was a bit odd [I later found out he had Aspergers] and looked depressed. Still though, when he moved to the floor to dance, everyone moved aside and cheered him on. For that moment, while he was breaking, I could tell he felt like he was apart of something, that he was socially acceptable. 2 days later he committed suicide. 

The next week there was a huge [relatively for bboy events] rally down at Churchill. The entire cypher was dedicated to him and his struggle. They shouted out his name throughout the night and danced harder than they ever did before. All this for someone they hardly knew, but clearly sympathised with and cared for. 

Hip Hop gets this rep of being cold, misogynist and bigoted. That night though I was convinced that wasn't true. Since then I've been to countless charity events, fundraisers and community events all in the name of Hip Hop. All in Edmonton. This blue collar 'town' of cowboys and big trucks isn't nearly as cold as it's made out to be. The Hip Hop community is just the same and has inspired me to write about how we, as a little community in Edmonton, need to come together and work on these kinds of projects as a community. 

http://www.edmflavor.com/2013/03/26/edmonton-hip-hop-time-to-unite/

I thought that it'd be good to share here because of 2 things. First, reddit is very similar in that it is a community of progression and communal sharing. For the most part reddit and its users work towards helping one another just like the Edmonton Hip Hop scene. Second, I feel like reddit has a skewed impression of hip hop. I think a lot of people here would actually enjoy a Street Art show or bboy battle and would be surprised at how welcome you'd be at these kinds of events regardless of how you look or what interests you have.

When you were first transferred to Edmonton, the Edmonton Sun referred to you as a terrorist, on their front page. I was very annoyed by this use of language.

When I was 15-years-old I did not have significant amounts of autonomous movement. If my family had decided we were moving to another country I would have had to go with them. If, when I was in this new country, a foreign army came over and started throwing grenades around my backyard I would hope I would have the good sense to throw them back. These are the facts of your case as I understand them and none of this is terrifying.

When I was 14-years-old a friend of mine shot and killed his entire family with a bolt action .22 calibre rifle, which his stepfather had given to him for his 15th birthday. This event still frightens me, just over 20 years later. He's now been paroled.

The logic of your prosecution and sentence seems dubious to me but I am glad you are serving your time in Edmonton as I have, perhaps an illusion, that your conditions and treatment will be better than anything I have read about as prisoner's treatment in Guantanamo Bay.

I hope this letter finds you in good health and optimistic about future parole. After all, locking up child soldiers doesn't make the world seem less frightening.

Sincerely,

Liam Leroux",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,,True,t3_1jggfj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1jggfj/an_open_letter_to_omar_khadr/,

I see this scenario every single day! Cyclists, you are not pedestrians, you're on the road, act like a car, slow down and respect traffic signs.

Now, I'm a cyclist and here's my 2 cents:

People, wear a fucking helmet! If you think it makes you look ugly, think about the hospital bed.

Cyclists, respect the rules of the road. If you're on the road, ride like a car, if you're on the sidewalk, act like a pedestrian (Never cross the road riding fast through a crosswalk).

I'm doing a bunch of contract work in the upcoming months, and I need some assistants. Here's some details:

- most of the jobs will be running new network cables in restaurants. No electrical work or anything dangerous.
- most of the jobs will be night shifts, either 7.30p-1a or 7.30p-6a. (ish).
- most of the work is slightly physical, standing on ladders, working in ceilings, etc. No heavy lifting needed though.
- most of the work is a little gross. I never knew something could be fuzzy and greasy at the same time before this job. It's not awful, but it's a thing.
- pay is... Good. You'll be happy.

Requirements:
-Be cool. (you're a redditor, so it's a given)
-Don't be uncool.
-Be reliable.
-Be smart. You don't have to learn a lot, but you do need to learn a bit.
- don't be dumb. 
- be the kind of person who tries hard.
- be the kind of person who can have fun. We like to have a good time.
- size doesn't matter. I have a 5'2 120# girl and a 6'5 240# guy. Just be able to put in a good day of decent physical work.
- experience doesn't matter. I've been doing this for many years, I've had waitresses pick it up right away, it's all the same. Just be cool and smart and ok with using basic tools.

I'll have several shifts a week for four to six months, ish, to split amongst a couple of people. Your own transport is cool but not a deal breaker.  I need awesome people who can do awesome work and not fuck up a sweet gravy ride.

Or am I just paranoid?,AquaConvolution,46,6,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1gvil0/door_to_door_scam_or_am_i_just_paranoid/,"I had two man in blue T-shirts and shorts knocking on my door just 20 minutes ago. I was sitting in the basement, but the knocks was so loud and so angry that it actually made me jump a bit in my chair. They claimed to be government workers(in a very aggressive voice). Those two didn't show any government identification, so I thought that was a little strange... We let them into the front door anyways to hear them talk.

First thing one of them says after he comes in, ""That's a pretty great piano!"", refering to the shiny looking piano facing the front door, then started looking around the living room. Then the other one started talking about how people in the area were complaining about the bills from Direct Energy and they were investigating it. Sure, fair enough, I thought. But then they started to ask us to provide them with bills from Direct Energy **AND** EPCOR so they they can copy them down. That's when my dad thought this is absurd, pushed them out the door and shut the door in their faces.

Oh yeah, the whole time except for the piano remark, they sounded intrusive/threatening, however you want to put it.

They then went around the block knocking on everyone's house, but I don't think any neighbours actually provided them with the bills.

So did anyone have similar experiences these few days? How did you deal with it? Am I just being paranoid or should I report this to somewhere?

Tl;dr, two aggresive man came knocking claiming to be government workers, no identification, and asked for bills from Direct Energy and EPCOR. Is this a scam or is it just me?

Edit: From chatting with my dad again, he mentioned them saying they were government workers first, then after coming into our house asking for the bills, claimed they were from Direct Energy. Pretty contradicting...

Mine include:

 Totem outfitters 74th ave and 99 street. 

they have a sizeable used sports gear section, I recall me and many a friend getting our first pair of skates in this place. There is also a rental/repair shop that I frequent for day trips down the river on a canoe or just for a few days of snowboarding. their last department has a wide array of camping gear, you know, ginormous backpacks and such. The staff there are also fantabulously laid back and fun to be around.

Sherbrooke liquor store is also great on 11819 St. Albert Trail.

Staff their are friendly and helpfull. they have a fairly wide array of spirits but what I really love about them is their beer. They have a big cooler with over 900 different types of beer. I talked to a staff member there and I was informed they will be celebrating their 1000th beer later this week. there might be some special on over it!

Your community feels poisonous and hateful. When people do interesting things in town, you trash them with ignorant hateful attitudes.

* Complaining that art or anything artistic is the realm of hipsters and thus must be derided. Really? You push against culture so hard that the only acceptable cultural event is one that is heavily commercially promoted and aligned with common pop interests?

* Downvoting anything that smells of event promotion. I want to hear about events thank you very much. This city has a huge communication issue and it is hard to hear about venues and events.

* Downvoting anything that's creative or took time and effort to create. The most recent instance is that guy who photographs event posters. Is it really so bad that he shares these posters with us?

* Downvoting any call for collaboration (there was some Edmonton wiki post a while ago like this). 

This all seems very strange given what tends to be popular on this board: lost cat postings, awful photos, repetitive questions about bars and stuff to do. Is it really all that awful to have other postings instead of just these?

This woman is scamming the people of Edmonton. Her story varies but generally goes something like this:
""I'm on my way to pick up my family from the airport, but I'm running on fumes! I left my wallet at home, could you help me out with some money for gas?""
This is a lie. Don't give her money. Take down her license plate number and report her! 
How do I know this? Because she has stopped me on the street and told me the same story twice (she didn't remember me, but I remembered her). 
This woman is like a fake charity-- honestly just the scum of the earth. Let's get her off the streets and  stop her from continually taking advantage of the kindness and naivety of strangers.

Last night I attended an information session on the South-East corridor that got me concerned that the design is not for users and priorities fail to address working people who need to travel from point A to point B. The system is going to cost $1.8 billion dollars and is slower than current bus systems. As someone who has used transit to get from south-east Edmonton to downtown the past few years I see this system as a step backwards and will explain why:

  •The train stops 10 times between Mill Woods Town Center and downtown. The projected travel time is currently 30 minutes. The bus route #15 currently takes 27 minutes to travel the same distance. 

  •The train route will travel along 83rd street taking over two lanes from car traffic. The existing road will become single lane north/south. This is one of Edmonton’s few north/south roads in the area.

  •Bus routes which currently flow along 83rd street will be redirected. Planners claim they will take parallel streets. What are the closest parallel streets to 83rd? 75th and 99th. South-east bus routes will be negatively affected and the displaced traffic and buses seem likely to cause even more traffic problems. 

  •There are no actual comparisons of capacity available anywhere on the City of Edmonton website. Page 8 of LRT for Everyone has an infographic with a lack of concrete numbers. http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/LRT_for_Everyone.pdf I asked at the information session: How many people can the train move downtown versus buses and compared with the existing high speed LRT? They have no estimates available.

  •While searching for more information I came across this blog: http://www.rapidtransitforedmonton.org/?page_id=145 which seems to echo some of my concerns. It goes into more detail about problems with the low floor designs and how the system doesn’t make sense for Edmonton.

I’d like to encourage everyone to visit http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/ets/lrt_projects/southeast-to-west-lrt-mill-woods-to-lewis-farms.aspx and voice feedback now while the project is still in the design phase before it’s too late. The cost of this system is more than three arenas and for what we seem to be getting it’s worth more discussion!

I ran the email address through Google, and it identified as a Western Union scam.

I inquired about a rental property in Edmonton. It had really nice pictures, two bed, two bath, two parking stalls and on 105th street. Asking $800. I knew from the start that it seemed way too low for what they were offering, but I inquired about why it was so low (could have been a temporary sublet or something).

Anyway, here is what I received after sending ""nice property, why so cheap?""


Email 1, claming to be from John Bonnet, john.bonnet@aol.com

&gt;Hello,
 
 
 
&gt;The apartment located in  10388 105 ST, Edmonton, AB, Canada is in excellent condition and it's just like in the pictures, very clean and very well kept. Honestly from point of view I'm sure that you will rent it on spot. I'm not looking to make a business or a profit with the apartment, I'm just trying to find a responsible tenant to take good care of the place. The apartment has 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It is furnished but if you want you can use your furniture and deposit mine in the storage unit near the building so is not far away. The rent is 800CAD/month with everything included (heat, hydro, water, electricity, cable and internet, 2 parking spots, laundry in-suite, washer and dryer). You will have full access to all the amenities of the building (sauna, pool, fitness room, gym, party room, visitor parking). Pets are allowed. I stayed in the apartment with my wife for 3 months. About me: I'm a civil engineer and I work for a worlwide company called Jacobs Engineering, I'm 45 years old married with 2 children. The reason I'm renting the apartment is that I'm relocating with my job in another country and I already signed the contract that will be for the next 4 years. Everything in the apartment is new so there will be no need for repairs. The only problem is that I need to send you the keys and papers because it is a private property.I'm sure we can make this happen. 

 
 
&gt;Regards,

&gt;John

&gt;Hello,

&gt;    Thank you for your reply. As I told you before the rent for 1 month will be 800CAD and damage deposit 400CAD  with no extra fees and you will have full access to all the amenities of the building. The price will not increase  for the whole period that you will stay there. I would also like to know how many people will live in the apartment and also which rental contract do you prefer- 6 months rental contract with option of renewal or 1 year rental contract with option of renewal. The monthly payments can be wired to my Bank Account (TD Bank) or we can setup a payment method that is suitable for both of us. The apartment is in excellent condition, you only need to receive the keys and the contract so you could check it out, and see if you like it that I'm sure you will. Since at this moment I'm in London, United Kingdom and obviously we need a safe way to complete this deal.The solution is a worldwide third party company called CLICKANDBUY (www.clickandbuy.com) ,they will provide assistance in handling the payment and delivery of the rental package.  With this procedure you will be able to check the apartment before I receive the payment. Please be aware that is NOT necessary for you to register with ClickandBuy given that I'm a registered user for 4 years and I've made over 30 transactions with them so far. They are really professional and they have great services. 
&gt;My phone number is +442070973803    (if you are calling from Canada or United States you need to dial 011-44-20-70973803). You can call me or e-mail any time you wish. 
Let me know if you are interested so I can provide with all the steps of this transaction, everything that you need to know about this process before we get this started. I think is right for both of us.


&gt;Thank you and hope to hear from you soon!


Email 3

&gt;You will only have to deposit to ClickandBuy the first month of rent from contract 800CAD$ so they can proceed with the shipping, and you can receive the rental package (keys and documents). I will pay for a 2 days delivery so you will receive the keys and the contract signed by me right away. I will explain you step by step how this process will work:

&gt;1 - To start the process all I need is your full shipping info(full name, address and a cell phone number).

&gt;2 - I will go at ClickandBuy to deposit the keys and the contract on your name as the intended receiver. 

&gt;3 - ClickandBuy will check the package to see if everything is in order and also the legal papers that will come along with the keys and proof of ownership with their Real Estate Professional Department in London. They will also confirm with the building manager that I'm the legal owner of the apartment I'm renting to you.

&gt;4 - ClickandBuy will send you a delivery notification to let you know they have the keys and the papers in their custody in which you will also have all the payment instructions to complete the money transfer to the ClickandBuy Agent.

&gt;5 - At this point you will have to make a money deposit on the ClickandBuy Agent Name for the amount we agreed, the total amount you shall deposit for the first month of rent. The payment needs to be sent within 24 hours after you receive the transaction details or else they will charge me an additional fee. 

&gt;6 - After you make the deposit you will have to send the payment details to ClickandBuy.

&gt;7 - ClickandBuy will verify the transfer and if everything is in order they will start the shipping procedures using UPS or TNT Next Day Shipping Service.

&gt;8 - After you receive the package, you will go and check the apartment and in 5 days (inspection time) you must contact ClickandBuy to inform them if you keep the apt or not and if everything is in order you will instruct ClickandBuy to send me the information about the money deposit and I will be able to receive the funds. If you don`t like the apartment they will be sending the money back to you and you will send back the keys and contract. ClickandBuy can't release the funds without your approval. 

&gt;Let me know if you have the funds available (800CAD$) so we can move forward and e-mail me your full shipping information I requested. Any further questions regarding the transaction you can call me or e-mail me. 

-----

This scammer asks for a deposit payment via Western Union or MoneyGram to an escrow company with a promise that he will send the keys through a courier company.

Sounds safe. It's not!
These companies do not work this way.

At other times, the scammer will ask for proof that you are able to pay the deposit and rent due to a string of time wasters.
This proof is in the form of a Western Union or MoneyGram payment to a lawyer,a friend or family member.

In either case, if payment is made and you give this person the details, they will collect the money.
You will not hear from them again.

If you are reading this because you are looking for property to rent, and you are in contact with this thief you are probably searching Craigslist, Kijiji or similar listing sites. If you receive any requests from 'Landlords' asking for some kind of payment before viewing, then it will also be a scam.

**Part 1 - Picnic @ Hawrelak**

Time: 2:00PM

Location: Hawrelak has a bunch of picnic spots that work on a first come first serve basis so I'll go there early on the day of the meetup and reserve us a nice spot (one with a pit). I'll also put up a bunch of signs around the area so it shouldn't be hard to find.

In order to organize food, drinks and amusement for this event, chemdiva created a public sign up sheet on google docs (a big thanks to her for that!). You can check it out ***[here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?hl=en_US&amp;hl=en_US&amp;key=t6t9-2EmHOrSIQUJNT8upPg&amp;authkey=CP6burME#gid=0)***.

If you're planning on attending, please sign in and let us know if you're bringing anything.

This is all assuming that the weather cooperates with us on June 25th. If not, and we get rained out or something, we'll meet up at the Citadel Theater to watch Serenity (since that seemed to be the next most popular option). I'll keep everyone posted as we get closer to the event with more information and confirmation of plans.

**Part 2: Meet at a Pub for drinks**

Time: 7:00 PM

Location: TBD... I'm having a hard time finding a pub for this meetup. The general consensus is, we'd like someplace that's central/easily accessible, someplace quiet, and somewhere with a good, cheap beer selection. The problem is, is that many of the pubs downtown and around Whyte turn into nightclubs on the weekends with live music and DJ's. If anybody has any suggestions write them down below. For now, I'll put my vote in for O Byrnes. If I call in advance I can probably get the back room reserved for Reddit.

[Telus Plan Page](http://www.telus.com/content/internet/index.jsp) / [Shaw Plan Page](http://www.shaw.ca/internet/compare-plans/)

It's worth noting that each Telus plan lists its speeds with a *lower* limit as well. [eg: 5 to 25 mbps] This really boils down to the quality of the telephone infrastructure in your area, and can be downright dismal in some parts of the city.

Also, I have not been able to dig up any hard information on what either Shaw or Telus charge for going over your data cap. If anyone happens to know I'd like to add that in as well.

One thing that really struck me with this is that we all need to keep a close eye on how long we let torrents seed, especially on the higher tier plans.

It was a negative, but still somewhat fair summarization (by Spanish_Muffin).

The comment, and /r/Edmonton post linking to it were both deleted. However, I feel this is something we should still discuss.

As a city, I feel we're way too quick to hate on ourselves. There are certainly a lot of negative aspects to Edmonton, but they aren't insurmountable, and they aren't the only thing that defines us.

Here is the text of Spanish_Muffin's comment:

&gt; Edmonton, AB, Canada.

&gt; It's a city striving on the cusp of the petroleum industry. And being the closest major city to the ""camps"" of oil workers, the city is populated with... I guess the closest I can come to is ""Texans that UFC like UFCING was a verb"".

&gt; Basically, the city is populated by the blue-collar industry of our province. The people here (compared to three other Canadian cities that I have lived in, Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa respectively) are collectively rude and self serving (one might make a case for ""all people"", but this is just my opinion here based on comparison). The majority have either become depressed with their lot, or turn into douche bags, to the levels that DnD Mike could never reach, with their ""oil dollars"" from working the rigs.

&gt; Giant, over jacked, trucks flood the roads, but always appear shiny and perfectly maintained, as they're only used for penis-pieces, not for actually lifting, hauling, or off-roading.

&gt; The City prides itself on it's sports teams, which are laughable, as is the commitment of the fans here.

&gt; We live in snow 7-8 months of the year, yet every time the snow starts coming down, I'm forced to drive past, at minimum, 6 accidents, on my 15 minute drive to work. Then if the snow melts, and it snows again (despite no snow being on the actual roads) the accident counter needs to reset, and we all need to crash again.

&gt; The city is filthy, grey, and our level of car break-ins and murder put the rest of Canada to shame.

&gt; The city floods itself with bars, clubs, and taverns, yet under staffs its police force in this areas, giving rise to street level riots after every major sporting event (thank the great Spaghetti that the teams here suck so it doesn't happen often).

&gt; The roads are picture perfect, when covered in a nice sheen of ice and snow, which the City always blows its budget for plowing in the first major snowfall. However, without the snow, the roads are poorly maintained, as all infrastructure budget is spent on ""fake architects"" (see Edmonton City Planners) that waste years and millions on through-ramps and overtakes on the few good roads that we have.

&gt; Our famous University seems to the be the only highlight, until you attend and realize that it operates as a research university, so necessary tuition hikes are mandatory, but don't expect to see any of that money go into your education - NO - it needs to be used to open up more buildings that we can't fill anyway.

&gt; We have a diverse culture, and are fortunate enough to have every restaurant, Italian soda shop, and burger joint to serve sweet, sweet...",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,,True,t3_147ucl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/147ucl/edmonton_the_good_and_the_bad/,

He has dark leathery skin (probably a white guy but very weathered). I'd say he's around 40s-ish. He was constantly smoking cigarettes.

   *Time:* 7:00PM

   If enough people are interested, I can call and book a reservation beforehand to make sure we get proper seating (maybe even a group discount).

If you have any other suggestions, or anything else you'd like to add, let me know and I'll update the post.

I'd also like to get a general headcount for reservation purposes so post a quick Yay +guests so I know who's coming. Also, if you're in need of a ride (and within city limits) let me know. I should be able to fit a few people in my car.

Edit: Oh poo. I just spent the entire morning updating the thread and I accidently refreshed my browser...

Edit2: I think it's been decided that the meetup will be a two parter - catch a show, vg tourney, or picnic in the afternoon, and meet up for a few pints afterwards. I've updated and reorganized the list up above. Keep the suggestions coming!

The problem is I have 2 cats. I need to find a place for them for 1 day. Overnight Thursday would be a great help too, but if I need to get up earlier on Friday morning, I can do that too. 

I've tried kennels, the problem with that is, besides most of them being booked solid, my cats haven't had any shots since they were fixed as kittens, they are now 3. They are indoor cats, never been out of the apartment their whole lives, so I never bothered with the shots. Probably not the best, I know. I've also been looking for a home for them for a year now, as they belonged to my ex, but that's another story. I need to find a place tomorrow, If the exterminator comes Friday and the cats are still there, they will just hide while he sprays and I'll come home to dead cats. They really are great cats, friendly, good with strangers, playful. They might even end up hiding away anyway since they're only wherever for a day. 

I'm in desperate need for some help right now, family won't work, my girlfriend is death-fully allergic to cats, so they can't go to her place. If anyone knows of something I can do, Please help me. I can pay for them to stay somewhere, I just need to find somewhere for them. I have food and litter to go wherever. Please, I need help.

Update: Thanks everyone for the support, I've found someone to take them for the day.",,False,self,t5_2raht,1374166555.0,,,True,t3_1ijiyz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1ijiyz/im_in_desperate_need_of_some_help/,

It's my opinion that in this case 'white pride', whatever personal opinions one might have on the moral and social weight of the statement, is nothing more than a potentially socially acceptable front for National Socialism and racial hatred. But I encourage anyone on the fence to do their own research; for a quick start Blood and Honour appears to be the group organizing it and Kyle McKee (of Combat 18 and Calgary's infamous rallies) has been promoting it.



It's important that those of us that stand for equality and against racially motivated violence exercise our freedom of speech just as they do. They can have their rally - we can have a bigger one and everyone is invited! So **tomorrow: 12 PM - 3 PM at End of Steel Park (off Whyte behind the farmer's market)** there's a rally being held in conjunction with International Day Against Racial Discrimination.

Not on Sherwood Pk Fwy, though - as you pass from the 80 km/h section to the 100 km/h section going westbound, a good third of the drivers continue on at 80 km/h! I've noticed the same thing in the other direction too - I will pass dozens of cars by simply doing the speed limit of 100 km/h as I head home... but then I get to the 80 km/h section where it splits off to Argyle and they all pass me again by continuing to do 85-90!

If you're interested in planning, maybe you want to check out the City's [Planning Academy](http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/urban_planning_and_design/planning-academy.aspx)

Looks like the next one is on the week of May 3rd on how to [""use your voice""](http://ereg.edmonton.ca/Activities/ActivitiesCourseDetails.asp?aid=12560&amp;cid=455382). I remember seeing these last year, so I think they run them every year.

*edit to add: You can take any of the courses in any order, there's no prerequisites, and you only need to take the ""required courses"" if you want to get their certificate. There is a modest registration fee for each.


But even if you don't do that, consider getting involved with your local community league or writing your city councillor or both. It does make a difference.

If you're passionate about walkable communities, now in particular is a good time to get involved with your community league as there's going to be grant money available to start a project focused on ""living local.""

1335016855.0,24,self.Edmonton,sl90s,My wife is in healthcare and I'm a small business owner. If the right wing gets a majority government we might leave the province altogether.,pansysauce,44,20,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/sl90s/my_wife_is_in_healthcare_and_im_a_small_business/,"I wont be unrealistic and demand that the Liberals or NDP win the next election... I know alberta is basically a sea of farmers that will (from my perspective at least) vote against their own interests no matter what.

But for the past 15 years I've seen:

- Ralph klien butcher healthcare with bill 11
- Energy prices skyrocket from deregulation
- Teachers get hosed, both in wages and working conditions, in which first the children suffer the most, and then the entire province 20 years later when they try to enter the workforce
- Oil sands money in alberta given to anyone but albertans
- the creeping mentality that a for-profit contractor is somehow better than a city employee at infrastructure work
- More cops on the streets being the response to the increased crime as an indirect result of the above

Then I listen to 630CHED radio tell me non-stop how the Liberals and the left are to blame for all of this, despite the conservatives being in power for the last 50 years (By the way...fuck you Dave Ruthorford. You are nothing but a propaganda machine; Albertas version of Rush Limbaugh. If paid liars like you didn't exist then the political landscape in this province would be very different).

I pay stupid amounts of taxes, and the wife is one of the healthcare specialists this province actually needs. If alberta votes in a majority conservative or wildrose government then my wife and I will (very possibly) take our tax money and education to a government that is more interested in the welfare of its people then the profit for its investors.

I know I'm probably preaching to the converted, but thanks for letting me rant anyways.

**EDIT:** We've discussed the possibility of moving to ontario or maybe to manitoba or BC for months, primarily because of the healthcare situation here. If we wanted we could move to the states and make a bunch of money etc. but we just aren't motivated by money as much as other types of happiness.  As for staying in the fight here...I've donated not only my time but my money at various provincial and federal elections for the past 8 years. I protested bill 11. I bother people in elevators and engage them. At the end of the day you just cant fight the wall of ignorance wrought on by the media and lack of education.

I work at a retail outlet by Stony Plain and the Henday. I usually lurk and don't have a Reddit account but I made a throwaway to alert you guys to this.

The white van speaker scam is a scam where two or three people rent white vans or SUVs and stock them with cheap crappy knockoff speakers and other stereo equipment and attempt to pass them off as state of the art equipment. Boxes often have a fake price on them and they attempt to sell them at a grossly ""discounted"" rate. They prey on people in retail parking lots like those of Wal-Mart, Future Shop, Petsmart, Home Depot, etc... Moreover, they use rented vehicles so they can't be tracked down.

Anyway, yesterday, I looked out the window of where I worked and spotted a white van scam happening. Having known what they are, and even seeing a few videos of them being confronted, I leapt into action, alerting my manager and chasing them off.

I called the cops to make a complaint about it and was told that they operate in a very legal grey area and for the most part, they're legal but just barely. There's nothing stopping them from operating except to go out there and tell them to get lost (because they're on private property, and they'd be risking a trespassing charge if they stuck around).

So anyway, if you happen to be someone in charge at a retail outlet with a parking lot that these scammers tend to use, don't hesitate to tell them to get lost and threaten to call the cops. While the cops may have their hands tied when dealing with them, it was implied during my phone call that they'd love to come down and arrest them for trespassing. 

And if you're not in charge of a retail outlet, but see this going on, don't hesitate to call them out on their bullshit. Preferably loudly and while they're in the middle of trying to sell their garbage to someone.

Firstly : What are the taxes over there? I know it varies state to state, so what are road taxes? Car taxes? Sales taxes? What percentage of your wage is tax? Basically - how does taxation work etc, and other monetary stuff.

Secondly : Where are 'solid' places to live? There is mum, step-dad, little brother and sister (8 and 7), so where is good for this age of kid etc (I know that's broad, sorry)

Thirdly : How much is stuff? Like... If I wanted a beer in a standard pub/bar or how much are groceries (again, sorry it's vague but any info on pricing of things would be brilliant)

Fourthly (or is it forthly?) : Where is good to visit if I went visiting? I have heard of West Edmonton Mall... but that is it really. I am a 26 year old chap who loves sports in all forms, love hockey so I already am familiar with the Oilers, but is there a CFL team, is there a rugby team etc?

Ermineskin park is walking distance from the Century Park LRT. Walk towards the Safeway, then cross the street just behind the safeway and continue down 25th Ave until you see the park.

His letter is basically a large argument for the introduction of two tier healthcare in Alberta and uses language like Alberta's Monopoly like the government is a competitive business.

Me personally, I think health care is a service that benefits everyone.

I decided to do a quick look at this guy and who he's affiliated with and really, his little organization seems like a front for groups like the Fraser Institute and other right wing south of the border funded think tanks.

http://www.jccf.ca/endorsements/

These guys have glowing endorsements from people like Stephen Harper's speech writer, and Ezra Levant.

Stephen Harper actually got started as a lobbyist for a group like this, whose goal was to get rid of socialized health care.

They've been trying for like 20 years. When Ralph Klein got in office, he started cutting services and blowing up hospitals.

When they fired the regional directors and created the Health Superboard, they pretty much fired all the doctors and replaced them with people like lawyers, insurance company insiders, private health care experts, and other people who really have no business being in charge of protecting people.

We have a corrupt government and an even more corrupt opposition which sucks for residents of our province.

Oh, one other thing about that John Carpay guy. He's a lawyer. He's also defending some [anti-gay, anti-abortion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Whatcott) activist.

Mostly, I just really see these people as liars for hire. He's backed by people who stand to make a lot of money off our health care system while our 'elected' officials help sabotage it from the inside.",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,,True,t3_1j4elc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1j4elc/a_letter_in_the_journal/,

",Tkins,40,15,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1a8f3e/hey_redmonton_were_a_couple_of_guys_out_of_yeg_we/,"Hello fellow Edmontonians. We have been running a little street brand out of Edmonton for just about 2 years now. It's been a rough ride and we feel the last few releases have been the most serious. We try to have a fairly broad range of concepts and since we get so much support from Edmonton we like to throw out tributes from time to time, as you can see with our E-city line. 

With our most recent release we've had some good positive feedback from our fans and other street brand owners and we're looking to see what R/Edmonton thinks. [How are we reppin the city? Do you guys think it adds value to our brand that we work with local artist, musicians, dancers? Is it important to you all that we do a lot of our manufacturing sweatshop free in Canada?] The vast majority of our clothing is made in Canada, all of the printing and embroidery is done right here in the city. We felt that it was important to focus on quality and with that we do have higher costs than normal asian made manufacturing.

Here's our Spring Release

http://www.edmflavor.com/2013/03/11/spring-2013-release-flavor/

Also, if you look at any previous blogs, videos and clothing we try to get involved with our community as much as possible. If there is anyone here that would like to be blogged about, work with us on projects, collaborate etc etc, we're always down for that.

I haven't gone out in forever because all my going-out friends moved to different cities (maybe I should take a hint?) and before that, I frequented private, niche clubs - so I'm out of touch with fun places in Edmonton, and I want to find somewhere I can go for a night out with my boyfriend and friends. 

No offense to the younger crowd, but I'm not really into the club scene - I'm not into going out to hook up, I'm not into the meat market feel, and I don't want to be surrounded by sweaty drunk kids. 

(And before anyone says it, please please PLEASE do not recommend the Black Dog on Whyte - I was really not keen on it the one time I went there, and I don't know why everyone always recommends it.)

* edit - it seems like the 30-something crowd is more foodie-focused than dance-focused. It's all about the good eats and good drinks in Edmonton!",,False,self,t5_2raht,1360012473.0,,,True,t3_17vr0q,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/17vr0q/where_do_30somethings_go_to_have_a_good_time_in/,

Although I like the vision of a new downtown arena, Edmontonians are telling me they want a much better deal to build it and operate it -- and I will continue to push for that.  
  
It's still lacking a $100 million contribution from the province and the City's been told that money is not forthcoming.  
  
**Many people point out that the original Katz Group contribution was to be $100 million, but now that money will come in at just $5.5 million a year.**  
  
What's more, **the Katz Group wants the City to give it $2 million each year for 10 years to pay to advertise Edmonton and the Oilers.**  
  
Many taxpayers are upset that the Katz Group will get all revenue from all sports and events at the new arena even though the City will own the rink.  
  
Besides all that we still don't know the total amount of dollars the City will contribute to the entire project including the interest on a loan of at least $350 million the city will take out to kickstart the arena.  
  
Nor do we know what the arena will look like. Key elements in the original sketches produced by the Katz Group have changed dramatically. **For instance, the impressive Winter Garden that was to have spanned 104 Avenue, is now not part of the arena project. It's slated instead to be a pedway.**
  
We need to get back to the table and renegotiate this deal so it's a win-win for taxpayers, the City and the Katz Group.  
  
A new downtown arena is a great idea, but it must be done right and the majority of Edmontonians must support the key aspects of the deal.  
  
Thanks again for taking the time to express your views.

My small 12lb male toy poodle went missing around 9:30 pm on Sunday June the 30th around 99 street and 78th avenue NW. He has no collar on but is micro chipped. His coat is short and wiry. He is white with a tinge of apricot. His tail is long and bushy. He was last seen going south on 99th street at 74 avenue. If you have found my dog or have any information please call me at 780-340-5809. Or call my house at 780-756-5809. Any time. 

Or if you have any suggestions on the best way to retrieve a lost pet in Edmonton please let me know! 
Thank you!

Every single one of them have been unpleasant when I decline their services.  They demand that I bring them my power bill so they can look at it, like they're doing me some huge favor.  Pretty much every single conversation from each of their visits went something like this:

Just Energy Rep: Hi, I'm with Just Energy and just want to make sure you're paying the lowest rate for your utilities.

Me: I'm actually with Enmax, so that's OK.

JER: Bring your utilities bill so I can look at it.

Me: Ummm...Why?

JER: We are authorized by the goverment of Alberta to ensure you are getting the lowest rate for your utilities.

Me: Huh?  Are you saying that you are a government of Alberta agency and that I am obligated to show you my power bill?

JER: That's right.  We are authorized by the government of Alberta.

Me: No, but you're making it sound as though you're some government agency.

JER: Yes, we are authorized by the government of Alberta to ensure you get the lowest utility rate.

To me, the correct answer to my question is, ""No, we are not a government agency, but a utilities company and I'd like to look at your utility bill.""  While their reply is not technically lying, they're not forthcoming with the facts either.

I'm assuming it must be part of their training and their canned sales script to keep on insisting with the line, ""We are authorized by the government of Alberta..."" and not one off occurrence.

But even after the third time having to deal with them, I can't get over just how rude and entitled they act about how I'm supposed to do what they tell me to do.

I tried calling their customer service line to see if I can request to have my home address on their ""Do Not Visit"" list, but after having been on hold for more than 45 minutes, I gave up.

Has any of you dealt with them in the past?  If so, how has your experience been?  May be I've just been unlucky.",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,,True,t3_1gxkc6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/1gxkc6/anybody_ever_had_to_deal_with_just_energy_door_to/,

&gt; No mention made of snow. Everywhere. Go Skiing, Snowboarding, Tobogganing, or Snowmobiling.

&gt;
&gt; There are a lot of x-country ski clubs, a number of other small hills for novices, and a lot more snow related activities if none of these suit a person's interests. When in doubt, hed to Totem, rent some gear, and ask for advice on where to go.

&gt; I don't know shit about snowmobiling though

1334544520.0,21,self.Edmonton,sbrix,UPDATE: Thinking of Moving to Edmonton,McBeau,23,2,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/sbrix/update_thinking_of_moving_to_edmonton/,"Original Post: http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/rc59o/thinking_about_moving_and_would_love_your/

After posting our original post and reading all your comments, we decided to just go to Edmonton and take a peek around. We just got back today and thought it might help to write out 10 thoughts in no particular order :)

1) You people drive fast. Really, really fast. Like flipping Autobahn fast. Perhaps because of the snowy weekend, the roads, highways and freeways were pretty empty so I didn't feel too stressed about it. The drivers seemed pretty good. 

2) People are really nice! The eye contact, smiles, general chatting and enthusiasm were great. We felt welcomed all over the place.

3) Huge trucks. Huge.

4) It snowed the whole time we were there! Classic. Actually, this was great because if it had been warm and sunny, it would have been maybe too easy to just go for the move. We need to be real about the climate change from Vancouver.

5) We got lost in Gibbons looking for some Rural Road # we could not find. That was weird. None of our maps showed the area so we hit a gas station to buy a map, where a truly baffled clerk informed me ""They don't make maps of Gibbons"". A volunteer fireman came in and glared at one tiny tattoo I had showing (it suddenly occurred to me that my sleeves might be a tad noticeable up that way) but I got rescued by a guy who could not stop telling me about how he needed sponges for a job. We bailed and decided maybe an acreage up that way wasn't for us.

6) Edmonton is pretty diverse actually. Saw people from all over. In comparison, St Albert may be one of the whitest places I have ever been (this is just a quick impression; we were only there for a couple hours). 

7) We were surprised and impressed by all the green areas of the city. I think Edmonton is actually very beautiful that way. The valleys and rivers are amazing.

8) We saw Help Wanted signs everywhere (very noticeable in Leduc particularly). Coming from Vancouver, this frankly astounded me.

9) We liked Leduc and Spruce Grove quite a bit. We drove around Cooking Lake area, saw some great rural homes, but it seemed a bit far off the beaten track. I typically like that but when I considered it in the context of heavy snow and minus 30 weather, it seemed potentially scary.

10) The roads were in about the condition you all warned us about. Potholes etc. Possibly this is why all the big trucks?

So, no decision finalized yet, but the affordable housing, lower taxes, plentiful work and nice people certainly gave us food for thought! Thanks for the nice visit Edmonton :)

**Edit: ok folks, decision has been made. We move to your fair city on October 1st, just in time for glorious winter :) Thanks so much to everyone for your comments and messages. Best  of luck to us all!!**

After a few months, one previously asked and particularly helpfully answered  [question](http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/156vmd/my_family_may_be_moving_from_england_to_edmonton/), various messages of well-wishing and such (some of which I forgot to reply to - my sincerest apologies!!) and the job falling through and a long list of setbacks and problems... The move is finally on, with a concrete job sorted!

The downside is its going to be a complex old affair! My stepdad is coming over first for 2-3 months and then the rest of the family is following after. 

The job is in Athabasca initially, and then after a few months relocating to Edmonton, so first question - whats Athabasca like? I did some Googling etc, and I have deduced that it is a very small, friendly community that is a bit 'out in the sticks'. Don't really know what to expect is all!

Secondly - what are the internet connections/radio/TV scenarios? My sadly ignorant Englishness doesn't know much about the above in other places! If anybody could compare anything to something they know about in the UK, I'd be eternally grateful!

Thirdly - When it comes to getting furniture to Athabasca and back to Edmonton a few months later, are there van rental places around and stuff? 

Fourthly (again, or is it forthly?) - What are the cheapest ways to get around Alberta? I managed to find out that flights from UK to Edmonton generally stop in Calgary/Toronto/Philly on the way, which seems to add a few pounds on the old flight costs - any ideas about possible places to fly to and get trains or anything?


Finally for now - What's the fishing scene like around Edmonton + surrounding areas? My stepdad likes a bit of fishing, and was just curious!

Many thanks for the last time all you beautiful people, and thank you in advance for any advice/information/good eating tips (which are always well received by this bearded man mountain!) you may wish to put on here!

Tally ho!

It's been a while since our last post but things change, people come and go, you know how it goes.  
**Here's the TL;DR: Edmonton has a Hackerspace, it's cool and you should check it out.**  
The longer version goes like this: The [Edmonton New Technology Society](http://www.ents.ca) is Edmonton's Hackerspace and we've got a great space just north of Downtown, between Oliver Square and Kingsway (Very close to MacEwan).  
I know there are quite a few of you who plug ENTS regularily when redditors have questions or request help that ENTS can cater to, which is awesome. We're thrilled that people are getting to know us and recommend us to others.  
In case you've got no idea what I'm talking about, give me a bit more of your attention and I'll fill you in.  
ENTS is a collaborative workspace where our members can come to work on projects, hang out and otherwise explore technology. Still not sure? [Check this video](http://youtu.be/wamwklXWK4M), it explains the concept pretty well.  
If you're curious and want to check the space out,  **you can drop by any Tuesday evening from 6:00pm-10:00pm for HackTuesday.** It's our weekly project night where you can show up unannounced, tour the space, meet some cool people and hang out.  
We also have our monthly meetings on the first Sunday of each month from 1:00-2:00pm. These can be a bit overwhelming for new people, but if you show up before or after the meeting, you can certainly ask anyone to show you around.  
If you've got any questions, you can reply here or email directors@ENTS.ca

I am currently employed by the City of Edmonton at the Waste Management Centre as a chemical EIT with their Advanced Energy Research Facility. I am largely in charge of procurement of chemicals and parts for the plant, as well as more engineering related work (i.e. Toluene solvent injection system, Sparger nozzle test station design, 3 Phase syngas-to-methanol catalyst reactor).

I will do my best to answer questions, but may be limited by what I can respond to IN DEPTH (based on confidentiality within the City of Edmonton and it's technology provider, Enerkem). The website for our facility and to acquire more info is [here](http://www.edmontonbiofuels.ca/?yams_lang=en).

I have a thorough knowledge of gasification systems in general (both from working with the city and also from doing a coal gasification design project in school). I also have a general knowledge of some oil sands operations and other chemical engineering fields (i.e. SAGD, natural gas reforming). Please try to stick to gasification and waste-to-biofuels questions, as that is my greatest extent of knowledge.

When the third lane opened up I ripped into it and shot past that driver. When past the taller middle part of the bridge and well on the way down the other side I saw the speed trap and got pulled over. 81 in a 60 zone resulted in a $200+ ticket. Since that day I haven't really sped. (Too expensive.)

Since that day I haven't really sped. (Too expensive.) Now whenever I see someone blow past me as soon as they get the chance I secretly hope there's cops perched up ahead. Well today it finally happened. A woman was riding my ass all the way from 50'th street to that bridge and when she could finally go around she just punched it in her little ford windstar and sure as shit there were the cops! This is only the second time I've seen them there so they must do it there once a year or something.

That's my funny story for today. :P

Recently me and others contacted some outreach workers regarding one individual we have come to know by seeing in our neighbourhood. We wanted to help him. Usually we would do this buy maybe buying him some meals, coffee, small essentials etc. Someone wanted to gather up some winter items for him and so called an outreach worker in Edmonton to discuss. They let us know that most homeless in Edmonton are quite well known to them and they have access to most of the things they may need (besides housing) to stay warm in the winter (blankets, hats, coats etc.) They also told us that this individual had a bit of a hoarding habit so giving him things would make it a bit harder for him since he would carry so much around. They did suggest that we could give him gift cards! It never really occurred to me before. They suggested gift cards for restaurants like Tim Hortons, Wendy's or where ever. I thought it was a good idea and although simple, I don't think people really think of this as something to give. I know that this individual would get several coffees a day from people as they passed him. Which is great but I am sure he can only drink so many. If you know someone who is need or have become familiar with someone who you know is homeless buy them a gift card in whatever amount you can afford.
Of course this is if you don't want to give them straight cash. Lots of people don't like to because they think the person will spend it on liquor etc. I say who cares, they are homeless and if a little liquor gets them through the day then so be it!
Anyway, the point of my post was to maybe bring some awareness to the many homeless people we pass on the street everyday and don't give them a second look. They are people just like you. We should help each other.",,False,self,t5_2raht,False,,,True,t3_13yxof,http://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/13yxof/homeless_in_edmonton/,
