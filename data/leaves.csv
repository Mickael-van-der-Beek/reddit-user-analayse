so you're thinking about smoking again. Well, I knew you would. But before you do, please let me remind you of why you decided to quit in the first place.

Remember when you wrote this? It was a friday night and you had turned down two of your friends' invitations so you could stay at home and get high. Remember how you spent the whole night smoking weed, browsing the internet and watching funny videos? Good times, right? Tell you what: It wasn't all that fun. Actually it was kinda boring. So why did you do it?

It's called a habit. You've been doing this for five years! And yes, it used to be fun. But in the course of time, things got out of hand. You started smoking daily, not because it was fun, but because you had grown accustomed to it. You weren't happy with it, but hell, you didn't know what else to do with your time anymore! You had lost interest in most other things, so you fell into lethargy, and all you did was smoke more and more until you couldn't feel your own boredom.

Now this isn't the first time you realized that smoking has a negative impact on your life. You even managed to quit for a few weeks every now and then, and boy that felt great! But sooner or later, you'd start thinking about all the good times you had with weed. You've been sober for days, maybe even weeks, so why don't you reward yourself with a little high time? Come on, it's just for tonight, you got no other plans anyway! Surely won't do any damage! And *BAM*, there you go again. It's fun at first, but you start doing it again and again and suddenly you're back in old habits. Because whatever you may think right now, how it's oh so different this time and you're totally over it... That's bullshit. If you do it once, you'll do it again. Think about it. You've been there so many times.

You need to realize that you can't just have a good time smoking every now and then. You've been trying to do that for years, but you're obviously unable to control yourself when it comes to weed. This leaves you with only two options. Either everything stays the way it is, or you quit. Once and for all.

Yep, that's right, no high time for you today. I know you pretty well and I know this is going to be really, really hard. But I need you to put that thing aside. Now you probably don't know what else to do with your time. And this may be the hardest part of it. You *need* to get your ass up and do something. I don't want to throw lame phrases at you, but hell it's just so true: Call someone, go outside, just do *anything*. And I promise you will feel so much better. Tonight, *and* tomorrow. Once you overcome your lethargy and start actually doing something, you'll feel just incredible! You will be proud of yourself, and you will see that it gets a little bit easier each time you do it. At least that's what they say, haha, not that I know anything about it, but it sounds reasonable man, so try it!

But seriously. Sure, you could have a fun high time tonight with your old friend Mary Jane. But it'll hurt you in the long run. You know it's true, so stop making up excuses and finally be the person you want to be.

Best of luck

I've had so much fun being high, walking around at straight, normal-people parties, high like an airship, with that TROLOLOLOLOLOLOL guy dancing around in my head, me thinking   
*""You totally don't know how much fun I am having!!! Alone!!! In here!!! I'LL HAVE MY 6TH PIECE OF CAKE AND EAT IT TOO, YA SQUARES!""*  




##I've been high all over. 
* In school.  
* In college.  
* At work: Behind the counter, in the street, in the office.  
* As a performing comedian, on stage.  
* While jogging.  
* While playing soccer.   
* While fencing!  
* First dates.  
* Dinners.  
* Job interviews.  
* Church.   
* Chess tournaments.  
* Celebrating christmas with my family.  
* I was on a train that derailed once, nobody died, i didn't blink once cause i was a solid [10] through the whole mess.    





I've had 10 years of this shenanigans. It's been good times, daily. But all this fun doesn't come without a downside: I'm addicted. I can't keep a stash, ever, without succumbing to smoking it. When dry, i've spent hours debating whether i should go through the trouble of re-upping solely out of boredom. I've had doubts about whether blazing up really is needed now while biking 10 miles across town to score. I've brought that bag back, with the only thoughts in my head being ""Everyone knows i don't need this at all, it won't help me, it's not necessary"", those thoughts persisting throughout the entire ritual of grind-fold-roll-burn, all culminating in exhaling that first toke going *""FUCK aaaah that hit's the spo- GODDAMMIT""*  





I've had the opportunity to quit a million times. Seems every other time i'm loaded with weed i'll smoke it like a fiend, deliberately telling myself i won't be re-upping when i go dry this time. I'm almost relieved when i'm empty, until of course the next time i hang out with friends. I'm also in the cheesy position of being known as the guy that always has something. Casual smoking friends of mine come up begging like puppies and it would feel awful to reject them, not to mention rejecting my massive stoner group of friends. I've realized through this where my priorities are. They go like this:


* 1- Get high
* 2- Don't die
* 3- Eat


And they really make getting up in the morning of a free day a challenge. 
What's for breakfeast? A hippie speedball and 7 hours of Tetris.
If you can still be arsed to make yourself a dinner meal you're not weirded out by, then this is halfway to a good day. If i could get my laundry done today this might be the best day of the month.











And this is the part that gets me. The stagnation, the don't-care. The staring at monitors and being content, the occasional moments away from that comfort spent in terror of the realization that my to-do-list is longer than my dick. Which needs a lot of encouragement to even give a fuck about ladies anyway, why deal with the pressure of love when i can masturbate compulsively on a schedule meticulously built around my pot intake? The problem is obviously not the fun parts, or all those times when i've coped, even when i've been so aware and awesome i felt sober (why the fuck would i spend time getting high then?), it's been all the time inbetween. The steadily increasing intake. The boredom on one side and dread of minor commitments on the other. The TL;DR take on life and all it's gloriously sedative distractions.








I've been around, you guys. I guess i've been worse. But it's time to get out there and be afraid of shit again. Take risks that i feel are actually risky. Blow it and beat myself up over it. Wallow and whinge and cry and kick and scream. Go straight. It's not only pot of course, it's the addiction to everything that makes me comfy. That's gonna end now. I'm picking up my cross and carrying it all the way to fucking Jerusalem, and when i get there hopefully they'll be so grateful for my journey that they won't crucify me. Wish me luck.

I started smoking in my late twenties and used pretty regularly ever since. I'm in my forties now. Early on weed was great, and I went from occasionally smoking to smoking every weekend, to smoking a few times a week to smoking every night. Once I started smoking up in the mornings before going in to the office I realized things were getting out of hand. I started to think about what is was doing to me and I came up with a list.

1) Daily use was making me *tired*. I smoked a bit in the morning before work, but the majority (three or four bowls worth) were smoked in the evening after 10pm. This was when the family was asleep and I was on my own time. Due to the late hour I ended up staying up until 1 or 2am playing video games or watching movies. Every damned night.

2) Daily use made me *fat*. Not only did I stay up late, my will to avoid eating was nonexistent. I would chow down on anything and everything. When I quit I weighed about 260lbs and the increase showed no signs of stopping.

3) Daily use was making me *negative*. I got through my day knowing I could get high that night. Everything I had to deal with was always tempered with the knowledge of an easy escape that night. Nothing had to be worried about. Nothing had to be dealt with. I was just going to get high. Thinking like that, and relying on weed so much as a crutch ended up making life seem very hollow. Nothing really mattered, and I could just not care about anything. In the end I really did stop caring, and I found my attitude towards everything became very jaded, like it all was just an inconvenience before my night started. I once heard myself complain that ""everything seems gray"" because there were no longer any peaks or valleys in life. I felt like a zombie.

4) Daily use was making me *lazy*. I stopped doing things I enjoyed and I stopped talking to nonsmoking friends. All I did was veg out and zone out every single night. When I wasn't high, I was thinking about getting high.

5) Daily use became *less and less enjoyable*. At first getting high was great. I'd do creative things, and laugh my ass off at movies and what not. Video games were an adventure. Food tasted soooo good. By the end it was all blah. My creativity died out. My desire to do things went away. I still watched movies, but I rarely laughed anymore and instead just sat there watching all spaced out. I ate more and more but it just didn't taste as good. I felt like a hollow shell, just going through the motions.

All of this finally broke one day when it occurred to me that grass was causing me more trouble than it was worth. I told my supplier buddy I was knocking it off for a bit. He didn't understand and sometimes encouraged me to start up again, but (happily) I refused. I won't say it wasn't difficult to turn him down though.

The first month really sucked with all the symptoms you'd expect. Headaches, insomnia, crankiness and all the rest. What got me through it was not only a desire to stop, but a desire to be more healthy. I resolved to lose weight and get some exercise, which I started doing this past July after one month of being clean. I stopped following /r/trees and started reading /r/Keto and /r/running. More importantly I took action by watching my diet and actually starting to run in the mornings. I couldn't justify a relapse if I knew I wanted to run the next morning... and *I wanted to run*.

That was in July. At this point I have lost 45lbs, and I run at least 5k every other morning before work. I go to bed before 10pm and get up at 5am every single day and I haven't felt this good in years. My energy level is increased, my head is clear, I am reconnecting with friends and family and finding enjoyment in old pastimes. All of this is what keeps me clean now, as I have personal experience of one extreme vs the other. Daily use, for me, does not equal a happy life.

I'm not against smoking a joint with my buddy again somewhere down the road, but I am never going back to regular smoking again. Never.

I post all this here for information, and for yet another personal experience. If you are trying to quit I hope it helps you realize it's worth it, and that it's possible to not only stop but to flip your outlook around completely so that you not only quit but start living more healthily too.

Good luck, and keep at it.

These are some of my favorite benefits:

1. I almost never go broke anymore.
2. Dreaming. I forgot how amazing dreaming could be! Dreams started to become really vivid around 4 weeks in.
3. I'm not nearly as tired as I used to be.
4. I'm not afraid of cops. I live about 4 hours away from my home when I'm at college, and every time I drove home, I was always nervous that a cop could arrest me for something I had on me. That is no longer an issue.
5. I've become less anxious. I've always had social anxiety, but it's getting better bit by bit. I can actually look people in the eye now.
6. I don't sound stupid anymore. I used to barely be able to hold a conversation, just repeating phrases like ""uh-huh"" and ""cool"". Now I can actually talk to people and my vocabulary has slowly been returning.
7. Focus has improved. I've always been ADD, but when I smoked every day, I had a 5 second attention span.
8. Depression has lifted. I've never been a super happy person, but when I was smoking, there were days when I couldn't get out of bed because I was so depressed. I'm not a bundle of joy now, but I can deal with my state of mind, and it gets better every day.
9. I'm much more impulsive. I was always very self conscious about being high, because I can't hide it at all, and I was afraid people would judge me for it, so whenever I smoked, I had to limit my choices to avoid being judged. Now I can just do whatever I want, whenever I want.
10. Pride. For the first time in a long time, I'm actually proud of myself. I always used to tell myself I could quit any time I wanted, but I didn't. Now I actually have, and I'm proud to know that i have the power to stand up to anything. I'm in charge of my own life. The journey isn't over yet, but it's nice to know I'm actually on my way somewhere, as opposed to just waiting for life to show up at my door.

I'm sure there are many other benefits to quitting, but these are my best reasons why anyone should quit. It's not easy, but it gets easier, and it's incredibly rewarding. I hope everyone on r/leaves gets to experience these!

Edit: I have to add one more: memory. I've always had a great memory, and I thought I lost that, but it's come back in spades!

The biggest step? Recognizing that while weed isn't bad for you, it certainly doesn't help you lead an enriching life.
What's the point of living to be high? Living to be half-awake? Living to maintain codependent drug ""friends""? Living to be not alive, but impaired?

Yeah, we all know the benefits of quitting, but why change? It's not like it's that bad for your health. Plus, blazing is sooo much fun... right?

So now getting high is more normal for you than staying sober. Thinking maybe it's time to cut back? I'm only going to swear this one time.

 LISTEN THE FUCK UP.

Even if you're planning to eventually smoke once a week, it's time to throw your pipe away, throw your bong away, throw your papers out, delete your dealer's number, and for Pete's sake throw out your pot. Seriously, if you truly understand the benefits of quitting you realize that throwing the weed away is better than smoking it at this point in your life. How much self-respect do you have if you know you want to quit but you can't do anything about it?

At this point you've done everything that you can DO to kick the habit.


Of course everyone is different but here's a general feel for what happens after you get rid of all your stuff. I'll briefly explain EVERYTHING, not just the benefits.

You feel like you can think a lot clearer after a couple of days.
A week in you'll notice your emotions becoming much more noticeable.

The emotional numbness begins to fade. You start noticing YOUR life around you. Holy crap! You have an impact on the world? 

Uh oh. You're sad now. Haven't felt this low in a while. Maybe a joint will numb you for just long enough. Yup.. that's what you needed.

You wake up and feel terrible. Actually, this feeling is familiar to you. Just a couple weeks ago you felt like this all the time. Wow this is stupid, you're going cold turkey now. That afternoon your friend calls you up and wants to chill. You tell them you aren't down to blaze but you want to hang out.

Turns out you don't yet have the willpower to be around smokers. So you join in. You're high. What's so bad about this stuff anyway?

A week of use goes by. And you realize again that this isn't the life you want. However many times it takes to quit, you'll eventually do it. 

This is your sixth time trying. This time is for real. You go a month with maybe one use. Why would you even wanna smoke again?

Wow, you're valuing your time so much more than before. Your confidence is peaking. You learned to control your emotions instead of just numbing them. You mean to tell me you were extroverted this whole time but never had the confidence or clear head to talk to new people?

As a sign of willpower you go a full month smoking 0 times. You're able to trust yourself again. 


Life goes on you smoke at most one time a week and sometimes not for months. Eventually you have either helped your friends quit by setting an example or you have mostly phased them out because you realize they don't do much of anything really.

You come back to /r/leaves to see how everyone else is doing. You read that thread that helped you quit in the first place and see how different your life is now. You see how much of life you have experienced since starting to quit and you think back to your ""high"" life. No regrets. You write a self post to help out others because if you can do it, why can't they? You are a better person for your year long struggle. You're doing what you want instead of having your life zip by you.

I love everything about it and I probably always will. I love the ritual, I love the physical action, I love the smell, I love the taste, I love the social interactions, and I love the high. Most of you guys (and girls) can probably relate! There are so many things to smoking pot that make it so alluring. I was a chronic pot smoker for over 6 years, starting in my freshman year of high school. Some of you may say, ""well I've smoked for way longer, you have no idea."" But I think all of us have an idea how pot has taken a serious chunk out of our lives. 

A year ago to this month I was caught selling weed by the police. It was a devastating time in my life and it basically caused the breakup with a girl who meant A LOT to me. Fast forward to me on probation and ""paying"" for my actions (of a victimless crime..). I was slapped with a year and half of probation complete with monitored sobriety. This meant quitting the herb...and what a wonderful thing it was.

""What!?"" you may be saying! ""I thought you loved smoking..."" and I do! But quitting the herb has gotten me so much further in my life than I ever thought possible. While the truth is (I firmly believe) that smoking weed is relatively harmless and there are MANY functional stoners out there - quitting the herb can help many to realize our full potential. Quitting boosted my confidence to the nth degree. All of a sudden I could talk to anybody and everybody without feeling self-concious or nervous. I became a complete stud at my job and secured a supervisor position with a management position just around the corner. I met the girl of my dreams and swept her off her feet and am having the greatest sex of my life (haha yes, very important). I can read a sentence without having to re read it 3 times before comprehending anything. I can listen to a person speaking and actually LISTEN. I fucking remember WHAT I CAME UPSTAIRS FOR.

So basically, getting put on probation was the greatest thing that could have happened to my life. The key is moderation, folks (blah blah blah yeah, whatever). I don't plan on quitting forever, but once I can smoke again, it will never be the same as it was before. I love my life now and will use weed as a life-enhancer, instead of an everyday-all-the-time-life-suffactor. I hope my story can inspire a few to do the same.

1367935255.0,83,self.leaves,1dv0vq,My sister died last Wednesday after a battle with a brain tumor. I wanted to share my thoughts on difficult times and my sobriety while they were still fresh in my mind.,Subduction,91,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1dv0vq/my_sister_died_last_wednesday_after_a_battle_with/,"She was diagnosed about a year ago at stage four, and with this kind of cancer (glioblastoma) there's very little that can be done.  She underwent surgery and chemo, which gave us many more months together, but it progressed and it took its toll.

A week ago Saturday we admitted her to the hospital for pain, which was a new symptom and not a usual symptom for this kind of cancer.  It turned out to be a serious and invasive infection that would have required extensive surgery to treat.  We decided as a family to exercise our medical proxy and prevent the hospital from treating the infection, a decision we knew would result in her death. 

In the past week she deteriorated quickly, was unconscious the last four days, and she died Wednesday night.  Because my other sister and I had been splitting shifts at the hospital she was never alone and I was with her when she died.

We talk here a lot about quitting being the hardest thing we've ever done, and having done it myself I know that's true.  But I can promise you that it will not be the hardest thing you ever do.

So when we talk about the benefits of quitting and the negative consequences of continuing to use, one important question is what person you want to be when these terrible times come.

If I were still using I could have stopped for the duration of her hospital stay.  All addicts can stop for a period of time, even a long one, if it's important enough and they know they can use again at the end.  

But what my sobriety gave me is not just being there at the important times, but also being there at *any* time.  To pick up the phone when my sister made the hard call to tell me she had terminal cancer.  Being clear-headed to comfort and counsel her. Taking my weekends to care for her.  Never having to do the calculus about when I was going to go there to help, meet my work responsibilities, and get high.

I know for a fact that at some point in the past year I would have made an excuse to not see her so I could make time to get high.  I know that I would not have been as good a decision-maker or as strong a contributor to my family in this time if part of my brain was always asking when I could return to using.

I would be left now with a terrible guilt over my actions, instead of a satisfaction that I did everything I could do to make her life and the lives of my family as good as they could be under these circumstances.

And most of all, because I already took on something extremely difficult with success, I knew I could make it through this.  All the tools that helped me control my dependency, planning, strength, asking for support, and humor, have seen me through this.  I had the skills not because I was born with them but because I had taught them to myself in advance.

Addicts suck at using big sweeping things like ""I'll be there for my family in the hard times"" as motivations to quit.  They are too abstract.  But I at least wanted to tell you from the perspective of someone who has been quit for a long time now that being clean makes even the worst of times better for you, and much more important, the people who love you.

Now that she's gone I feel sad, but at peace with the situation and at peace with myself.  If you have a dependency then staying clean is the only route to that peace, and it's my most sincere hope that each one of you is in a place to find it when these times come around to you.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,1367935460.0,,,True,t3_1dv0vq,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1dv0vq/my_sister_died_last_wednesday_after_a_battle_with/,moderator

Goodbye old friend.",,81,8,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h30fi/after_17_years_of_lighting_up_almost_daily_im/,"My dad gave me my first bong hit. I was 13. He called it ""Doug,"" as in ""Wanna go talk to Doug?"" My mom gave me my second, thinking she was giving me my first. This became a regular ritual between my mom and I that fostered a strong relationship between us in those days. Pinching nugs from my mom's stash (I know she knew) was the first thing that *ever* got me in with the cool kids. I had never really had any friends until I started smoking pot. 

I still remember my first time puking from weed. That was so embarrassing. We got a good laugh out of it, though. I remember the first bong I ever bought, which was much more a bing. I was very careful about asking for a tobacco water pipe. Have you ever taken a bong hit of tobacco? It's pretty ridiculous. 

In my mid-twenties I got a job making glass pipes in a glass blowing shop. The owner of the shop said I was pretty good and had a knack. They all thought I was a little weird, which I proudly am, but they accepted me anyway. Once I accidentally waved my hand into the torch for a split second. Gnarliest blister I ever had. I have a cool scar from it that kinda looks like a trout. 

By far, the most important thing weed ever did for me was help me kick alcohol. When I was coming out of the closet in my early twenties, I got majorly depressed. I cut off communication with my family and ramped up the alcohol intake. Eventually I was downing two or more forties a day and chasing it with a pint of whiskey. I lost several years to daily blackout drinking. Then one day, my friend who was trying to kick heroin says: this is fucked, let's go to AA. So we did. I didn't end up staying a twelve stepper. He did. I elected instead to employ what recovering alcoholics call ""Marijuana Maintenance."" I stayed off the booze, but I became a double-time cloud blower. And for the last two years, that's what I was.

That is until 6 days ago. As I pulled the corner off of my bag to pour the last keefy mound into it's bowl, I thought about how my asthma was coming back. I wondered how many amazing conversations I must have derailed by deciding to break out my pipe. I wondered how many tens of thousands of dollars I had thrown into escaping reality. I am now almost 30. What if this was the last bag? And so with the same defiance that I dismissed the bottle from my life, I decided that was that. The last bowl. Funny, I don't remember what I did. I probably sat at my desk and stared at the curtains.

So that's it. My naive teens and my long dark twenties where well seasoned. Smoking pot got me my first friends, which got me into being in bands, which got me into taking music seriously, which got me into college, which is responsible for basically everything that came after. Now I'm all growns up, but I am lucky to have had such a rich, hilarious time. Here's to 17 more years of sharp wits and powerful lungs. Thanks for reading all.

1354561679.0,71,self.leaves,147pm1,Learn the lesson from me: You can't return to smoking moderately after quitting. ,deepfriedgirl,86,15,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/147pm1/learn_the_lesson_from_me_you_cant_return_to/,"Hi again, r/leaves family. 27/f here. It was a month ago that I quit trees after 9 years of daily constant smoking. I went from [convinced I couldn't quit](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/11qiy0/wants_to_quit_convinced_she_cant/) to [the pain of Day One](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/12ohk1/from_i_cant_to_day_one/) to [experiencing how much easier it gets after the first couple days](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/12tb9r/day_3_and_its_already_getting_a_little_easier/). I wanted to update the r/leaves family on what's happened since, and share a hiccup that may help some of you.

All in all, even after 9 years of being high all the time, quitting was not as hard as it is to think about quitting. It is so overwhelming to think about quitting. Sure, the first week SUCKED. I experienced it all: crankiness, weight loss, no appetite, sweats, insomnia, couldn't think about anything but lighting up. But I had received some golden advice on this subreddit: treat the first week like the flu. Allow yourself to feel like crap. Feel comfort in knowing that life without trees is A LOT easier than quitting trees, and that the first week is no indicator that every week will be that hard. **By week two, I was already finding a new normal and enjoying it.** I felt so proud of myself. I realized that I had stopped enjoying getting high years ago, and that all that I was hanging onto was a habit. Sure, the habit felt good because getting high feels good, but it wasn't that I was quitting something that I NEEDED, like food, air, or sleep. I was quitting a habit.

In other words, quitting sucks, but it's so doable. Even after a decade of smoking, it took only a week for me to see how much easier and easier it was getting to live life without trees, and actually even enjoy it. By the end of week 2, I wasn't even waking up thinking about lighting up. Trees became a bad ex-boyfriend and distant memory.

**Then I had a hiccup.** ~3 weeks in, I got too proud of myself. I got too confident that I was able to control trees and now I could somehow reintroduce having a stash around, for an occasional night toke. So I got myself an eighth last weekend. Sure, the first couple days, I smoked once a night. I thought ""well this is already more than I had planned on, but it's SO much less than what I was doing before."" I even didn't like HOW carcinogenic it felt to inhale smoke, which is something i never felt before while smoking. I used to LOVE the smoke aesthetic. By day 4 of having the stash, I was already allowing myself to smoke during the day. By day 6, I was back to my old ways of waking and baking. 

r/leaves family, I see A LOT of this discussion on this subreddit. People speculating and asking whether it's possible to return to trees later on. I really thought it would be possible for me. I want to tell you all that it is just plain impossible. **It's a drug addict's myth. It jeapordizes everything this subreddit seeks to change.**

We're here because we have a problem. It's easy to sugarcoat it, but we're drug addicts. We've each created a dangerous and unhealthy relationship with weed. I urge you to learn from my mistake. Don't focus on trying to return to trees. Don't focus on whether you can bring it back later. Most importantly, **don't reward your success of quitting with the thing you're quitting from.**

6 days, r/leaves. It took 6 days for my old relationship with trees to return in full force. I am disappointed in myself, but I'm not ashamed. I'm actually really glad I learned this lesson so early on in quitting. It made me realize that I can't trust myself with moderation. 

And so today, I begin again. No stash left. Armed with the knowledge that moderation is a drug addict's myth. Armed with the knowledge and experience that quitting is so very doable.

I started smoking weed when I was 14 and daily when I was about 17.

I can relate to so much on this subreddit. When I was a smoker I thought I would never want to stop and never be able to. I developed a form of OCD that was at its worst while I was smoking the most. I started to go to therapy for the OCD about 6 months before I quit. Weed happened to be one of my triggers. If I wanted to drop one habit I would have to drop another. That was good enough incentive for me. When my therapist suggested quitting I remember rolling my eyes. I remember how going 3 days without getting high was a huge achievement for me. I'm still shocked at how far I've come. 

I didn't think of it as quitting. I started to think of it as more of an experiment with my body and mind. Like ""What would happen or what would I be like or would I be able to?"" I also quit taking anti-depressants at the same time. But I won't get into that. 

I've slipped up numerous times. I haven't been sober for a year straight. And that's okay. It's still been a year for me. Smoking a few times a year is a huge improvement from smoking a few times a day. 

I still have the other habits I was trying to drop by quitting. I still have OCD but it isn't nearly as severe. I still binge eat once in a while but it also isn't nearly as bad. I used to rely on and need weed. I don't any more. It isn't exactly a year *sober*, it's more like a year of not relying on weed. One year of freedom. It hasn't been all happiness and sunshine. But I don't regret smoking weed, I don't regret quitting, and I don't resent any of the other habits I've been trying to over come. It has all made me better than I've ever been - even when relapsing.

To sum it up, I feel so much more like myself. I induce my own moods now.

Despite the years I actually still think about this a lot.  This is going to be long...

I remember the first time I made a conscious decision to quit for good was senior year of college and I lived with 2 other guys. One, Doug, was a major stoner and so it was basically always available. The other roommate, Rick, and I were daily users, and it got that way by living with Doug. Graduation was coming up and Rick and I had a conversation about getting a job and drug tests and that it was problem a good idea if we quit. So we decided to quit. That night when Doug brought the bong to the living room table, Rick and I just looked at each other like ""seriously, we're gonna stop doing this NOW?"" We got high that night and every night after until I moved out. 

After graduation, and moving to a new city by myself, I thought I'd be set...no more college, no more weed. It just turned out that among the adult people I met, there were enough users that I couldn't just avoid it that easily. Eventually a roommate of mine called me out on saying things like ""I know I shouldn't smoke anymore, but I guess I will tonight..."" So I just stopped saying stuff like that, but still smoked. The internal conflict between wanting to quit and smoke was well-established. 

I had an incident that scared the fuck out of me and made me very paranoid for months. I got a new job maybe 2 years out of college and I went into it without even considering they might test me. I showed up to sign the contract, tax paperwork, etc., and they told me then about it. I ended up confessing to the HR guy that I would probably fail the test and that if that was a problem I would not accept the job. Lucky for me he was more concerned will filling the req so he somehow bought me a few months' time before I took the test and passed it. I managed to stay off it for a while after this but eventually started again... 

I didn't smoke again for about another year. I felt like it had been so long, and I was proud of that. Then I had a friend visit me from out of town, a girl I knew in college who was a good smoking buddy. She had some with her and I kept telling her and myself I wasn't going to do it. After drinking one night I caved and smoked. Guess what I did first thing the next morning? Wake and bake...just like that, after a year away. 

Then another work situation occurred, this time a layoff, putting me in the position of needing a new job and likely a test or background check. This was the final straw that got me to quit 4 years ago. Ultimately for me, my ability to make money must take priority over weed. Long story short, drug tests and background checks are a reality in my career and I do not ever want to lie in a professional setting, I'm just not OK with it. Not because of moral reasons exactly, but more because of my inability to lie well and deal with guilt. And with security clearance background check interviews, when they ask you if you have smoked weed, it's ok to say you have before, but it's not ok to say you still do. 

Just some random thoughts on my experiences with weed:
 
* I have had 4 pot-induced panic attacks. Luckly for 2 I was just at home and ended up going to bed to chill out but they still scared the fuck out of me. 2 others were in the car, while I was driving, and again lucky I managed to pull over and stop the car before anything bad happened.

* Weed was probably a factor in one serious relationship with a good woman ending. It probably would have ended anyway, but I can't say for sure.

* I've stolen weed from friends.

* I've thrown weed away, twice. Both times involved get high by myself for the 3-4th day in a row and just 
getting disgusted with myself.

* Weed always triggers other moderate abuses of mine: porn and food specifically. I know everyone gets the munchies but for me it led to weight gain. 

* A small list of other dumb shit I've done stoned: locked keys in car (twice), spilled a drink on a blackjack table (almost kicked out of casino), lost a friend's cellphone, generally act very antisocial and boring and/or weird.

* Some friendships I had before quitting with people who smoke have either disappeared or diminished. I have just had to accept this. Only one of the guys I actually miss but I still see him a few times a year. We just don't smoke every week like we used to.

* I have recurring weed nightmares, where in my dream I end up smoking and feeling so incredibly guilty and disappointed in myself.

My life has gotten way better since quitting. Without that immediate escape waiting for me after work, I found that I had to occupy my mind by planning for the future. This resulted in starting to take dating seriously with online dating and that has been pretty successful. I've gotten into a lot of outdoor and athletic hobbies like hiking, camping, volleyball, running, biking, etc. I feel like pot kept me too docile to care about planning and/or training for those kinds of things.

If you read all that, thanks for reading. I hope this is helpful or at least interesting to anyone who has been through similar stuff.

It's this haze that makes us forego the productive activities and healthy relationships that I think people who have never excessively smoked take for granted. Maybe, instead of hating ourselves for falling into this haze, we should appreciate the extra potential we have as a result. Once becoming sober, you realize that you have all of this time that was previously spent focusing on, or getting high. To fill this time, we generally try to be incredibly productive, even more productive than sober people. My day used to revolve around the next time I could smoke, making everything I was doing in the present feel worthless. Now, everything I do is worthwhile because it passes the time, and I appreciate the stimulation so much more. So, the haze actually helps you appreciate the value of your time once you become sober and you therefore utilize that time to become a better person.

Someone on Leaves said ""play the tape through"" and it has stuck with me.

2. This I got from a youtube video by Allen Carr.  I felt uptight about not smoking- a feeling of craving, a feeling of desire to feel that high.  I took some advice from Carr.  This feeling of craving and the mental thoughts around it, **in and of itself**, is what caused the unease- *nothing else*.  Once I brought my awareness to this, recognized it, and then took my attention to something else I immediately felt a release of that craving.

Over half my life. Three decades. Ronald Reagan was president when I started, and there was no such thing as ""the internet"".

I'm a 43-year-old self-employed computer geek, I have a wife and two great kids, a nice house in a fancy neighborhood, nice cars, yearly family vacations, a new Macbook every two years, etc. and by every outside measure my life has been a success. And to be honest I've never really wanted to quit. I thought of pot as a solution and not a problem, and was self satisfied that I was somebody who could successfully integrate weed into my daily life. In fact, I am a shining example of the kind of person people mean when they say ""Relax, plenty of successful people smoke pot every day!"" and I believed it as much as anyone.

So what happened? 

I'm not really sure. 

To be honest it was my wife who basically laid down an ultimatum recently, and after some initial anger, I'm starting to think she is right and I'm willing to try. She smokes also, but she is one of the lucky few who can successfully smoke a couple of times a week at most (and then only once per day).  She's the kind who could buy a quarter ounce and have it last a year. 

For me, it is all or nothing. 

If I have it (and I ALWAYS have it) I will smoke in the AM after kids are off to school, and then off-and-on all day long until the kids come home, and then again all night once they are off to bed. As mentioned I'm self-employed and work from home, and this makes it very easy to be high around the clock. I don't smoke a lot and I never get ridiculously baked (especially during the day) but I do have a pretty constant light buzz all my waking hours. 

Then about 6-7 months ago I bought an MFLB (portable vaporizer) and I have to say it was the best thing EVER invented. It meant I could smoke anywhere, anytime: in public restrooms, at concerts, the car, my Mom's house, literally wherever and whenever I wanted with very few worries about smell. So it's always been bad, but in the past half year it went to another level where I am pretty much high ALL THE TIME no matter where I am or who I'm with at the moment.

On top of this (or perhaps as a result?) the wife and I have been going through some particularly rough times recently (mostly about money, sex, and a lacking sense of closeness together) and rather than deal with that pain I pretty much shut her out of my life and went on happily about my business for months without acknowledging any problems. It didn't matter to me because I was high and happy all the time, but not the wife.

The straw that broke the camel's back is that I showed up at our annual tax meeting with our accountant high and glassy eyed (which she immediately noticed).  And as it turns out I made waaaaaay less money this year than I projected.  And in the cold dark light of the day after we fought, I realized that my business is kind of in shambles: lots of missed deadlines, unhappy clients, cancelled meetings, late bills, excuses, etc.

So it turns out maybe I'm not so happy after all, and not doing so great. 

We're financially hurting a bit now, and things feel like they are falling apart before my eyes with my business and my marriage. So perhaps the green is causing me more harm than good at this point. I've always suffered from a low-grade depression for as long as I can remember, and in my head, weed was always an acceptable self-medication and far better than Prozac or the current flavor of the month. I took a perverse sense of pride that I could live my life high, and that I was better for it and mostly happy.

But what if my wife is right? 

What if the weed is causing the depression and always has? Where might I be in business/life if I hadn't spent the past three decades in a haze? Why can't I face some of the very real pain in my life? Why can't I get a real investment plan in place for our family and college educations? Why at age 43 do I still regularly pay bills late even when the money is sitting right there in my account? Why I have not gotten an oil change for the car in over a year? Why do I spend the night playing guitar until 4AM, and then cancel a client meeting the next day because I'm not ready? Why am I afraid to look my kid's friends parents in the eye because mine are likely bloodshot and glassy? 

I guess I'm about to find out. 

It's day two, and to be honest this is super easy for me. 

A few years back I went for 6 months just to see if I could, and it was easy. I don't have the crazy withdrawals that many of you describe (my sympathies). Not only can I sleep, but I can go to bed at midnight instead of 3AM. 

But here's the trouble. I may have been more energized in the mornings, but I never really felt any more happy or ""together"" -- I just felt a lot more bored, less creative, lightly depressed all the time, and like I was missing out. So on the EXACT day after the 6 month mark, I eagerly met up with my connect and went immediately back to multiple times per day, every day. 

So while I know I can do this for 6 months, a year, whatever, here is why I'm writing:

I'm scared to fucking death of it being forever, and yet maybe that's the way it needs to be because I AM AN ADDICT. But man it is not a good feeling.

I'd been smoking daily for about 10 years, and in that time only had two significant breaks, each about 3 months long. My biggest shame is that I smoked before work, every day, for the last six years.

I chose to quit smoking at the end of a stressful day. My longtime employer and I had reached the end. I was being asked to leave, and because of my good work and reputation, I was given the opportunity to publicly resign, though we privately knew differently.

Seeing a job search ahead of me, I wanted to quit smoking to be ready for potential drug tests. This was my ostensible reason for quitting: drug tests during job searching. I quit that night have haven't cheated in these 61 days.

If you'd asked me whether pot had negative effects on my life, I would have had a hard time telling you that it did. I enjoyed smoking a great deal, and I was telling others and myself that it helped me control anxiety. I was getting promotions and raises, and, as a manager at my company, I was getting great reviews and my direct reports told me I was the best boss they'd ever had. I even found the love of my life, after a long time of searching.

I should have been looking for a job. I shouldn't have let things get to the point that I was asked to leave. Though I enjoyed being a manager to my team, there had been changes occurring at the company for the last few years that I was not on board with. I had real philosophical problems with these changes, and I wasn't shy to let my supervisors know it. It was making me incredibly unhappy. 

But I didn't look for a job. I told myself and others that I did like my job. I'd been there a long time, and I cared deeply about what we did. I had made that job part of my identity and took these changes really personally. 

I know the real reason I didn't look for a new job when I knew I should be looking for a better fit: I didn't want to quit smoking pot. 

To be fit to pass tests, I'd have to quit, which meant facing my current job sober, and I wasn't willing to do that.

To do the work of finding a new job while holding down a job, I'd have to quit smoking to keep up the energy and focus to put extra working hours into my day, networking and applying for jobs. I wasn't willing to do that.

And I am here now. I am so angry at myself for letting that happen.

I have not told this story to many people. They think I was brave for leaving my job, since the public story is that I resigned. Many colleagues have confessed to me that they're unhappy as well, and also disagree with the changes that were happening. I've been called a warrior for standing up for what many of us believed was right, when many others were choosing to keep their mouths shut and just go along, which I do not begrudge them for one bit.

But I know this version of the story is true, too. It didn't have to get to the point where I put my livelihood in such precariousness. Being unemployed sucks. 

I am happy I am sober for so many reasons. I see now that I need to stay quit, because even though it wasn't entirely obvious to me at the time, pot has had a seriously negative impact on my life, particularly my career, and insidiously so.

I've been smoking weed since the summer between high school &amp; college... It started off as a once-a-month thing, progressed quickly to a daily habit, and at this stage, I've graduated from bongs and blunts to concentrates and taking 4-5 dabs of wax a day.  This alone is frightening, as it speaks so strongly to dependency and addiction.  

  Like stated above, I have that uncomfortable, everything would be better &amp; more fun if I smoked feeling whenever I'm sober.

   I think one of the hardest things in stopping is knowing I don't *need* to, in the larger sense.  I got a degree in mathematics while smoking multiple times a day, have a good job, great friends, am very active and healthy, etc.  There isn't some glaring hardship I'm facing because of my habit.

When I go backpacking by myself, I bring some herb to celebrate after a long day's hike.  These aren't things I'm worried about.  It's the lifestyle that I want to end... the every day, can't eat dinner without having a smoke first type of shit I'm tired of after 7 years.

   I just can't seem to end the pattern of:

* Home from work, let's get some stuff done
* Oh, well, this one is boring and repetative, I should smoke before doing it!
* Smoke, maybe get something done, then fall into the pattern of smoking and doing something else, smoking and doing another thing, etc.

This is the longest I've went without getting high for about 12 years.

It's been 18 months since I stopped smoking, and I couldn't be happier that I made the decision to quit. You know what my life was like when I was high all the time—I was passive, unmotivated, and numb. Most of you have probably used the same adjectives to describe your own smoking days, though perhaps not out loud, or to anyone but yourself.

When you're not stoned all the time, you realize how, well, BORING it is to sit around all the time! I've started exercising more, improved my grades in school dramatically, and did some self-introspection that has really served me well. There is so much to do out there. If weed it holding you back, you need to cut it out of your life. It is difficult to fill the time at first, and I do still struggle with it sometimes, but being sober forces me to be aware of what I'm choosing to spend my time on. Do I really want to watch TV reruns for three hours, or do I want to start reading a new book instead? Go for a bike ride? Go out to dinner with a friend? The possibilities are endless, so why should you settle for sitting stoned on the couch? 


I would be lying if I said I never got cravings, but they are few and far between now, and definitely not as strong as they were when I first quit. Maybe it's just because I haven't surrounded myself with people who get high, but I rarely even get offered, and then it’s easy to turn down. Saying ""no"" does get easier. I used to agonize over the decision before spitting out that little word, and after that I would worry over it even more. These days, ""no"" comes automatically. It'll make you smile to realize that you're doing it without thinking, and that you don't feel like you’re missing out. 

You're not missing out! Being sober for a long time feels so much better than smoking again. I can't say for certain that I'll never light up again, but it doesn't seem likely. The biggest thing keeping me from getting high once more is the fear that it won't be worth it, and that I’ll have flushed *more than* a year and a half of sobriety down the drain for nothing. I fear that I'm too self-aware to lose myself in marijuana again, but that is also a positive, isn't it?

Now, I know what is an extremely triggering day for many is coming up very soon. My message to all of you who are considering cheating: don't do it. Your sobriety has been hard-won, no matter how long it is, and you have earned the right to continue being sober. That's the reward—sobriety—not giving in to the addiction again. The ""break"" you get is when you see that you're having more fun than your high friends, when you realize you're not quite sure how long it’s been since you last smoked, when you feel higher and more alive sober than you ever did stoned. Hang in there, leaves. Keep fighting. I promise you it's worth it.

Right now I'm a little stoned, and I feel good and relaxed. I'm thinking about how much more productive I would be if I wasn't getting high all the time. I'm thinking about all the things I could be doing. I signed up to the gym recently... but I'm too high to go. I'm too high to go to the kundalini yoga class I just started. I'm too high to want to even leave my room. In fact I want to smoke another bowl.

This morning, like most of my mornings lately, I woke up and knew I wasn't going to smoke today. I got a little work done, made some coffee, went for a run, etc. 

Around noon I went through a rationalization process that I'm all too familiar with -- one that I desperately need to exorcise from my consciousness.

All of the sudden, I flip flop. I tell myself that weed isn't a big deal. It's part of who I am. Maybe I'll stop in a few months or something like that, but why now? It feels nice. I can't concentrate on my work unless I'm stoned, anyway. I do good work when I'm stoned. How many artists out there are stoned all the time? A lot. I'm just one of them. It's part of the creative process. It's practically legal here in L.A, too. Well, I'll just go buy a gram, smoke it, and tomorrow I won't smoke.

Then I go to the dispensary and before I know it I've twisted up a self blunt and I'm high as hell. I'm usually really productive for a couple hours. Then I start to get kind of sleepy. I start thinking about how I shouldn't have smoked. I could have gotten more done if I didn't. I keep smoking, and eventually stop working. I procrastinate, and I smoke. And it's not long before it's painfully obvious: I shouldn't have smoked. I have too much to do. I'm going to have to make compromises today.

Then it hits me, once again, that I'm an addict. That's why I've done this again. I can't stop smoking. I shouldn't have smoked today, and I did. Just like yesterday.

I consider flushing the rest of my weed, but I decide that I might as well just smoke it, so I don't have anything to temp me in the morning.

I start hating myself for my lack of willpower. I get enough done in the day to scrape by. I go to sleep peacefully. I go to sleep as the person I am right now. 

When I wake up, it starts all over again.

I usually buy small quantities of weed because I'm constantly convinced that it will be my last gram. And I really AM convinced. But  when I find myself sober later on... I begin to have a change of heart.

It's not even that being sober is so miserable. It's not like I fiend constantly and would suck a dick for an eighth or something like that.

But I can't stop for some reason, even though I know I should. I can't stop turning into this other person. How do I get rid of him?

1372930355.0,55,self.leaves,1hmj0u,My Personal Guide for Withdrawal Symptoms,cycle_killah,62,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1hmj0u/my_personal_guide_for_withdrawal_symptoms/,"Hey everyone,
 
I've been through the process of withdrawing from weed countless times, so I just thought I should share some personal advice. I know more than anybody, withdrawing SUCKS. Big time. But there are things you can do to make you feel much, much better during this time. I'm going to focus more on the physical withdrawal symptoms, which usually last on average about a week. The more you've smoked, the worse you'll feel and the longer it'll last. The longevity of the withdrawals can be minimised by following this advice.

After you start feeling better physically, it'll take a few weeks to battle through some emotions to be back to ‘the real you’. Just remember: everything is related. If you don't eat or sleep properly, you'll feel worse, and the worse you feel, the worse your appetite and ability to sleep will be. There are four main areas I’ll focus on: 
 
**MINDSET**

When I first started experiencing withdrawals, I was so negative. I’ve realised that I was just unknowingly 'forcing' myself to be this way. Only you can control your own thoughts. I would become depressed, over-analytical and thinking about all the bad decisions I've made, how I'm ruining my life, and just basically thinking that I'm a piece of shit.

* The most important factor and the one that will contribute most to the severity of your symptoms is your mindset. Cannabis withdrawal is psychological.
* You're mindset right now is so vulnerable and it's easy to fall into a hole.  This leads to so many other problems and is the reason for your bad symptoms, you have to remember: the only person that can make you happy is YOURSELF. 
* Stop feeling sorry for yourself, you're over exaggerating all of your problems in this state. TRUST ME, this is just a phase. Even though you might be grumpy, irritable or depressed, force yourself to be happy. Just smile! :D and 'act' like you're feeling great and that everything will be alright. And it will, you've made a decision which is ridiculously hard for a lot of potheads. You should be looking forward to being yourself again in no time!
* It's also important to live in the present during this time, don't be consumed by past or future worries.
* Additionally, I would sometimes feel so much built-up emotion and felt the need to 'let it all out' - this helps a lot. Talk about how you feel to someone you trust and who is supportive (but keep in mind that you're in an emotional state, so choose who you to talk to wisely), cry if you have to, write down how you're feeling, listen to some pump up music and go for a run. Somehow RELEASE all this emotion if you can. 
* Breathing: I've also found breathing helps, here's a little test you can do. Time yourself breathing normally for 45 seconds, and count only when you breath in. The first time I did it my score was 17, which is too high and creates perfect breeding ground for anxiety. The number you should be looking for is around 6. Try to change your breathing pattern to breath slower. Put your hand on your stomach and when you breath in, do it nice and slow, making sure that your stomach inflates (if it doesn't normally, it means you're only using the top half of your lungs). Hold it in for a full 5 seconds, and release slowly. Try the test again using this technique; you'll notice you'll feel so much more relaxed.
 
**APPETITE**

Your appetite is screwed isn't it? And when you are finally hungry, you eat a little and no more. I also find that when I eat hot/cold food, my body temperature adjusts immediately. 

* You HAVE to eat. Without food and nutrients, you WILL feel terrible. Try and space out your meals, sometimes I would just force it down with water if I have to. Have snacks, fruits, or even protein shakes with decent calories. Roughly counting calories helps if you can be bothered. 
* You might feel sick/hot when you eat, but trust me, don't underestimate eating - you'll feel so much better if you do. And drink as much water as possible (find out how much you need, Google water usage calculator. The recommended drinking amount will most likely be higher than what you're consuming. And don't drink too much either!). 
* Again, it's all related. If your brain isn't getting sufficient nutrients; you'll be in a terrible mindset, which contributes to... less appetite, and you won’t want to eat. Try to overeat more than you normally would, and try not to think about how much your appetite sucks and how you can't eat. Be positive!
 
**SLEEP**

How annoying is it when you're trying to sleep, tossing and turning, and you can't 'get out' of your mind?
You're consumed by your thoughts and the fact that you can't sleep. 

* Don't nap during the day as lethargic as you are, don't drink coffee after 5pm, get to bed early and try to get physically tired by exercising. 
* Don't look at any computer/phone/tablet screens half an hour before bed. Get into low lighting. I also recommend [f.lux](http://justgetflux.com/), which adjusts your monitor's brightness at night to ease up your eyes. Check it out.
* Hot camomile tea (very hot, sip slowly) before bed is good, and make sure you have fresh air while you sleep. 
* Even with all these things I still found sleep the hardest to conquer, until I found something called 
L-Tryptophan. More info on this: It's an essential amino acid, but you rarely get enough of it. I'm not sure on the exact science of it, so feel free to correct me. This is how I see it (broscience incoming). You take this magical pill (which is found in food but you probably don't get it much) -&gt; It boosts serotonin and melatonin levels in your brain (which promotes positive mood and restful sleep). I also like it because it doesn't ‘forcefully’ boost them; if your brain needs more of it, it will use it and won't over-create serotonin/melatonin. I know one thing for sure: it makes me sleep and feel better, but do your research. Personally, it's a life saver for me. I take 1000mg-2000mg before bed, on an empty stomach (no food for 3hrs), and also take a vitamin B supplement which helps the metabolism of amino acids. I won't go in depth but happy to expand on this. Other supplements to look up: 5HTP, Melatonin itself, L-Tyrosine (for mood during the day). 

**EXERCISE/ACTIVENESS**

I would sit around all day, feeling depressed, lethargic and really lazy. It's the worst thing you can do. 

* Force yourself to be active. Exercise, sweat it all out and get tired. You'll feel way better mentally too. 
* If you really don't feel like full-on exercise, just do something active, do SOMETHING. Don't just sit around on the internet for 8 hours browsing Reddit feeling sorry for yourself. Get up and have a snack.

**CONCLUSION**
 
You'll soon start feeling better (as long as you don't smoke! BIG no-no). You'll get hungry again and love it. You'll eat something and it will taste amazing, you'll notice all your senses will improve. You'll stop being so irritable, your self-doubt and over analysing will go away and you'll discover how big the weed-free world actually is. This is fantastic, but at the same time it leaves you vulnerable. Why?

1. You feel really happy. You've been off it for a while and you never knew being sober was this good! So why not feel a bit better, just have a small joint, since you've conquered your addiction and you'll only do it this once. Or maybe infrequently. If you're an addict like me... you won't. Don't get me wrong, you'll love it. You'll start to think, ""Man, it's not THAT bad!"" or ""I'm young, everyone’s doing it, fuck it!"" or whatever excuse. Before you know it, your 'soberness' is gone and you need to earn it again by going through a rough couple of weeks, which isn't that bad right? Which brings me to my next point.

2. Somehow, no matter how bad you suffered during withdrawals previously, it doesn't matter to you. Hell, you can't even remember how bad it was. You'll under exaggerate and underestimate it. But yet once you go through it, again and again (like I have), you'll never know how it actually is unless you're experiencing it. Maybe try and write down how you're feeling, write a letter to yourself, or record a video.
 
If you sort out these four things, you’ll feel so much better. One last thing I’d like to point out. There’s a lot of people that don’t believe cannabis has any withdrawals, you might hear or read stores like ‘I smoked for X years, stopped and never went through any rough patch!’. Remember; it’s psychological. 

For some reason, we 'withdrawers' have a different mindset and all of these symptoms are VERY real to us. I also find one thing interesting and I’m not sure if it’s true. I never fully experienced any of these withdrawals until I learned about them. The more I learned about the symptoms, the more I actually felt them. Weird isn’t it? I guess my last piece of advice would be (as impossible as it sounds): if you want to get over the symptoms, pretend withdrawing isn't real. Pretend weed isn't apart of your life and that you never smoked and convince yourself you feel normal while ensuring that you eat, sleep and exercise regularly. It's actually pretty simple when you think about it, just don't blow it up in your mind. The hardest part is yet to come, depending on your goals. Your mindset will change positively, and weed will be tempting even though it's caused problems for you. Here's a good goal to have: never let yourself withdraw from weed again.

I lived in an apartment and smoked by myself daily for years, avoiding friends, never dating, just going to work and spending all of my non-work time smoking alone.  One day I smelled weed in the common area and decided to investigate.  It was coming from the window of my next-door neighbors, who had just moved in the week before.

I knocked on the door and a very stoned guy answered.  He introduced himself as Brian and asked me to come in to meet his friends and his live-in girlfriend, Marisa.  They were all stoned and smoking pot, so of course I went in.  We all got high, and I learned that Brian dealt pot for a living.  Prayers answered!

For months, I'd get off work, rush home, and knock on Brian's door.  He'd answer, invite me in, and get me stoned.  He was the only person I socialized with.  Every now and then, I'd buy some pot from him, and while I had pot in my apartment, I'd come home from work, smoke by myself, and avoid everyone, Brian included.  Only when I ran out would I resume knocking on Brian's door, seeking out his company and his pot.

I didn't like the realization that I was only hanging out with Brian because he always had pot.  I felt guilty and ashamed when he'd invite me to the pool or a friend's place or a local bar and I wouldn't go because I was already high by then and would rather just go home and kill time than socialize elsewhere.  However, I kept showing up to his door, smoking his pot, and telling myself that someday I'd actually do something social with him.

A year after Brian and Marisa moved in, I came home from work and saw that their door was ajar.  I opened it, and their apartment was completely empty.  A maintenance man stepped out from the kitchen and asked if he could help me.  I told him no, that I was looking for Brian and Marisa, and he told me that their lease was up and that they'd moved out.

I felt horribly at that moment.  In the past year, 95% of my socializing had been with Brian, and he moved out without telling me, which led me to believe that he saw me, accurately, as a complete user who contributed nothing to his life.  I'd never invited him over to my apartment.  I'd never asked him to go to a bar, to get a bite to eat, to go to a concert, anything that friends do.  I leeched off of him and only sought him out when I didn't have any pot of my own.  He shared with me all the time, and I shared nothing with him.

Seeing myself through his eyes - a friendless loser who smokes his weed and never returns the favor - really felt like a punch in the gut.  I didn't blame him at all for not telling me he was moving.  I'm only surprised that he put up with me for as long as he did.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1geovd,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1geovd/i_felt_like_such_a_loser/,
1365018453.0,55,self.leaves,1blx8e,6+ years and my life is a jillion% better,dstahl11,60,5,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1blx8e/6_years_and_my_life_is_a_jillion_better/,"This is my first reddit post, so please be kind. I was so surprised and inspired to find this sub-reedit I had to post. Sorry if it is a bit long.  
   I was a daily pot smoker from ages 17-35. And like many of you I considered myself a functional addict. I held a job, made enough money to live on, and basically got by.   
  The rub however was that I was spending almost 1/2 my take home pay on weed ($800 a month). I was unable to have a sustaining love relationship. I would rush home after work to get high, but then spend the rest of my night alone in my room smoking in my room and watching TV (or gaming). I had plenty of great ideas but never followed through with one. I could rarely articulate thoughts I wanted to express; when I spoke it would generally sound discombobulated if it was a remotely complex idea. Really my world shrunk down to either being at work or alone in my room.   
  I thought pot was making it so I could deal with the world and all of life's frustrations. I thought it was keeping me from being depressed. (what I later found out was that it was at the root cause of these issues). 
  This went on for years and years. I had tried to quit on my own many times. Sometimes I made it as far as a few months and thought I had beat it. But just when I thought the war was over,something would trigger me to try it. After the first toke I immediately had to score my now stash.   
 I had come to accept that this was how life was going to be and I was just going to be a stoner for life. 
  But some kind of grace I was eventually guided into checking out a Marijuana Anonymous meeting. My therapist and few girls I had been dating kept pressing me to try it. The day I walked into that meeting was the day my life changed.  
  In fact I was done a long time before that. I just didn't know how to stop the endless cycle. What happened to me in that meeting was I heard people telling stories very much like mine. I realized I was not alone and here was a support group of people that had been just like me, but were staying clean. The weird part was that they actually looked happy and appeared to have their shit together. After that meeting I was willing to give it a try, and when I got home I gave away all my stash to my roommate.   
  I had a lot of misconceptions of what recovery was. I thought it was like a cult. I thought you needed to get into religion. I thought I would never laugh again and basically be miserable. I thought it was for only alcoholics and coke/heroin addicts.   
  But instead I found…that spirituality and religion are two entirely separate things, and neither is a requirement. I found that I have never felt happier in my life,. Today I find things way more humorous and laugh harder than ever (addicts and alcoholics in recover are some of the funniest motherfuckers). I found I when I was using I was living in a ""fantasy of functionality"". I found that I can be present for my friends and family, and not ""checked-out"" on weed. I found and married the most amazing woman. I found that I have become seriously successful at my career (both financial and career growth). It's crazy. My life is beyond anything I could have ever imagined it would be.   
For anyone just starting out, do not be afraid to try this. I would suggest trying to check out a meeting if you can. I am lucky that they have MA meetings in my city. But if they don't in yours, I would check NA or AA (I regularly check those out as well). It is an action program, and doing the 12-steps with a sponsor makes your sobriety diesel. I got a sponsor very early on, and hit a ton of meetings in my first 3 months. It is hard to just break the ""habit"" of doing this (especially the first few weeks), and meetings give you the support to keep going. It is an investment in yourself.  
   Anyone that tries to tell you that pot is harmless, non-addictive, or one of mother natures herbs, is just bullshitting you. The pot today is nothing like it was 15 years ago. The stuff is so engineered now, and can affect your nervous system harder that other synthetically manufactured drugs.

I know its lengthy, but please try giving it a read. I've been smoking and quitting for a very long time. I'm just now figuring things out and think some of you can really relate and be helped by the mistakes I've made.

So after quitting for almost 3 weeks, I caved. I wouldn't consider it a catastrophic failure however. It was really fun for the first smoke I had in 3 weeks. I was actually feeling that 'high' that we seek. The one we don't get anymore because now its just bland and boring. As soon as day two rolled around, I smoked again and thought ""yup, this sucks and it's why I quit in the first place."" It's only fun when its not part of your daily life. Smoking more than that, for me anyway, just isn't anything I want to do anymore. This time, I'm not going to relapse. I realize now that working so hard (seeing how long I could quit for then caving) for one good high isn't worth it. I was much happier experiencing the natural highs life has to offer. Those are the important, meaningful, fun highs we can only get from not smoking. 

Life is better and more vivid. It's like the first high after you've taken a long break (Like I was referring to earlier) only you don't need to worry about it or constantly worry when the next one will come. You feel happy and they come naturally. Now that I started smoking again, EVERYTHING is bland. The sober natural highs don't occur and the weed high is pathetic. I know I've stumbled, but it is all part of the process and steps I personally need to take to help me realize how much I want a sober lifestyle. It's made me realizing I'm not quitting weed, I'm living a better life. Period. It's not about seeing how long you can go without smoking. It's not about counting days sober and thinking ""will I ever be high again?"" That's a very difficult way to work through such a hard process of quitting anything. Its about me realizing how I truly want to live my life.

All we want as people is to be happy. It's about discovering how you are happiest. I'm not quitting anything for any reasons. I don't feel my health, or memory, or work, or anything else is MAKING me quit. I feel like my own personal happiness is leading me to a sober life. If you don't have a reason to stop other than doing it for X reason, then you will always be constrained within struggle of your own brain, trying to rationalize everything.

Take some advice from me if you can. Realize quitting is what we think we need. Its not. We need to do what makes us happy. We need to do whatever it takes for our brain to be at ease and pleased with our life and current situations. For me, this means leaving the herb alone and KNOWING I'm much happier and in a much better place because of it. You've helped me so much leaves, I promise I won't relapse again. I'm starting to figure out the big picture I lost for so long.

TL;DR: Do whatever you need to do to realize that leaving the herb alone is the best thing for you. Relapse all you want, do everything you want, smoke when you get the craving. Everything you do is part of the quitting process. If it's eventually going to lead you to a sober life, DO IT.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1jvxtp,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1jvxtp/i_relapsed_and_im_so_glad_i_did/,

I’m a lawyer with a lot of tech clients, some of whom caught on that I was on Reddit and actually figured out my username).

First, thanks to all of you.  Everyone’s stories helped me decide to quit and stay quit.  Today is day 80 for me!  So I figure it is my turn to post my wall of text.

I need to post because when I read some of your struggles I’m so proud of you, but I’m also scared you’ll scare some poor stoner from taking that first day off.  My quitting was hard, sure, but not as hard as others I’m reading about.  I’m not saying this to brag, but just to reinforce that every single person is different.

I’m 45, and I smoked pretty constantly since I was 16 or so.  High School was fine, I was one of the sharpest kids in the school, but I was happy with no effort A-’s and B+’s.  I was a great test taker, so my SAT’s kicked ass and I squeaked my way into U.C. Berkeley.  Same story there, joined a fraternity, smoked A LOT, got good grades, crushed the LSAT, squeaked into a top 5 law school. 

Got married, have a family, a good career, I’m a good dad to 2 wonderful girls and a good husband, I think. 

But I always smoked pot, sometime more, sometimes less, but it was always there.  Daily, but usually one bong hit or two a night.  Weekends I waked and baked, and smoked all day.  I’ve been doing this for the past 15 years.  

Home with the wife, doing little projects on our first little house?  Stoned.
Playing with our new baby?  Stoned.
Working too many hours during the dot-com boom?  Stoned the moment I come home.
Soccer coaching my kids?  Stoned.
School functions?  Stoned.
Parties with grown-ups?  Stoned.

Mostly stoned alone, me and my bong.  My wife thought I smoked 1 or 2 times a month.  So yeah, I lied about it too, and hid it like a champ.  

For the past 5 years I found myself smoking more and more.  3-4 bong hits a night.  I’d rather stay home than go to a party.  When work wasn’t going full tilt (I’m an M&amp;A lawyer, so I have wild work swings) I started taking a hit before work on Fridays, why not, I was in control.

One week this spring I realized I smoked pot every morning before work.  I think I was a functional stoner, but I knew then I had to quit.  

Started with giving it up for Lent.  That worked!  40 days off!  Easter came, the next night after work went to my dealer and bought a ¼ to celebrate (I usually buy by the ounce to minimize transactions, I was trying to limit myself).  Started off with one hit a night, and again it creeped up. 

I decided to quit once and for all as soon as the bag was done.  My very worst time was realizing I really had no more weed.  I almost panicked, but didn’t.  Went a week, and the next weekend in a burst of motivation I cleaned my garage, found a little nugget in the bag of drawer, and lapsed (otherwise I would have been at 86 days right now).   But I’m clean since then.

Did weed ruin my life? Not at all.  Never sucked dick for weed.
Did weed limit me?  I’m sure it did. What could I have accomplished if I spent as much time doing something else, anything, instead of smoking pot?  Been a Supreme Court justice (I have a classmate who is a federal judge on that track)?  Learned an instrument?  Train for a triathalon?  SO MUCH TIME WASTED.
Did I smoke joints and joints a day?  No, 3-4 hits (maybe we’re smoking different types).

Just quit.  I’m almost at 3 months.  I got past the headaches, the irritability, the sleeplessness, and you will too. Hopefully those symptoms will be like mine and you’ll overcome them with willpower, if not you will learn a lot of tips in this subreddit.

My brain is clearer, I dream now, I’m remember people’s names after I meet them, and I’m wondering what in the hell was so attractive about dulling my senses day after day.  Almost 30 years of living in a fog, the fog is lifting and I can’t believe how great it feels.

Again, thanks to everyone of you who posted, I’m sure you helped more lurkers like me.

Or, at least I had been pretty good about it until the end of March.

I'm the best man at my brother's wedding, and his bachelor party was in Vegas at the end of March. I had been stressing about it constantly for a while, wondering how I was going to get through it(obviously there would be lots of smoking going on all around me). I couldn't physically separate myself from the smoking, I needed to stay close to my brother.

Anyway, about 2 weeks before the event, I finally just decided ""Fuck it, I'll smoke for that one weekend. My bro is only getting married once(hopefully), I won't be smoking at all after that weekend, it's not like there'll be any other temptation similar to that this year.""

Well, as soon as I made that decision in my mind, I started thinking about it all the time. Looking forward to getting baked again. Thinking about freshly ground weed in a clean bowl. I started getting lazy and not keeping up with my good habits(meditation, exercise, waking up early). I stopped doing all the things I had worked so hard at to try to erase the ingrained habits of 10+ years of habitual smoking. Even before I had actually relapsed, I was acting like a lazy stoner again.

Then, after I got home from the bachelor party, I found myself thinking about weed all the time. My wife smokes once in a while, and I'm pretty sure she has a stash somewhere in the house(I never see, hear, smell, or know about her smoking, that's the agreement that allows her to not have to quit totally). A couple of times in those first days after the bachelor party, I tore up the area of the house I thought she was hiding her stash in, although I never found anything.

The lesson here is, there is no ""little relapse."" Even going back to smoking temporarily will fuck up the progress you have made. It's more than just the count of days since you last smoked. It's everything you've worked towards.

So for those of you thinking maybe you can just smoke a joint on 4/20 and then go back to your non-smoker life, think very seriously about the consequences. Even just making that decision to relapse will start to affect your life immediately, let alone the actual event of the relapse itself. 

And as we all know, there's a damned good chance you'll find yourself buying a half-ounce and smoking all day every day again. So maybe you'd be better off detaching from all your smoker buddies on 4/20, go for a hike or a weekend trip out of town or something.

Insight Into the Experience.,throwaway011011011,64,16,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1f7yty/my_one_year_clean_insight_into_the_experience/,"This week marks my one year anniversary of being completely clean of marijuana. I hope that sharing my experience will help those looking to get clean by allowing examination of what steps I took to make my experience successful.  

**Choosing to Quit:**
I chose to quit after 7 years of total use, with 4.5 years of them being heavy/chronic use. I had finally summoned up enough courage to make it a lifestyle commitment due to finally being able to see what it was doing to my life. I would smoke whenever I wanted. Sometimes I would smoke in the morning, but most of the time my smoking would start after noon and continue until I went to bed. My change in views occurred due to a combination of two events: finding this subreddit and taking a class on the neurobiology of addictive substances. Being a science-oriented individual, seeing that marijuana was not the ""golden"" drug that most people thought it was helped me critique my own addictive behavior with more rigor. Finding this sub helped me realize I was not alone in my thoughts about the damaging potential of marijuana.  

**Setting Myself Up for Success:** I had tried to quit two times prior to my current sobriety. In each instance, I had remained marijuana-free for approximately 10 days. Before embarking on my current endeavor, I examined why I had failed on my previous attempts. I found that my main shortcomings were my surroundings and my rationalization to smoke again. So I tried to set myself up for success. I wrote down reasons of why I wanted to quit and why smoking was no good for me. I also wrote down reasons why I may be tempted to go back to smoking at all, even once. I wrote down, with conviction, the negative feelings I experienced due to marijuana use.  

In regards to my surroundings, I had many of my close friends that smoked, and even some that would heckle me for my latest attempt at smoking cessation. I knew these people were some of my biggest enemies, at least in my path to sobriety. So I distanced myself from them as much as possible during my first month of sobriety. I would spend my free time outside their influence or mentally occupied with some other activity. I was taking some demanding classes so most of the time it was spending more time in the library or in the gym. I would take my sweet time walking around to classes or even plop down in a nice park to leisurely read. I knew that if I went home with too much free time, I might be tempted to get high.

However, I was not able to completely exclude my smoking friends from my life because they included some of my closest and lifelong buddies. When I was with them, I didn't tell them about my endeavor but just politely declined any form of marijuana smoking. After a few weeks they were able to pick-up on what I was attempting. They asked me why I was quitting marijuana. I would answer that I was ""over smoking."" To this day, I have only told the closest few of them my views on the addictive problem that I had. After about a month of not smoking, all of my friends stopped offering me weed during their rotations, knowing that I would not accept. My decision even led to a few of them stopping (and reducing) smoking as well.

**The Good:** Within a week, I could feel that I was regaining mental sharpness and my thoughts were returning to a happy place. I quit feeling the emotional numbness that marijuana had cast upon me. Also, I had enough ""steam"" to push through the first week of partial rationalizations, knowing that this time was the time that I would quit and that my thoughts would not lead me astray. The mental clarity and positive mood changes continued to increase for the better part of a year. Today I figure my mental sharpness is 90% returned, but that is complete speculation. However, I know that a 2nd year of sobriety will almost certainly result in me being 100% recovered from the effects marijuana caused.  

**The Difficult:** Like I said before, the initial detox process in the first two weeks of sobriety was easier than ever before due to my continue resolve to quit marijuana. Even though I possessed a Volcano and relatively new monster of a bong, I knew I was going to quit this time. However, there were a few potential hiccups along the way. I remember one time in particular at about 5 months clean. It was the beginning of the cold season here in CA and I was in my home. My housemate had gone home and it was just me at home for the weekend. I fired up the heater and was doing some cleaning while listening to some Bob Marley. The heater kicked in, the Wailers were wailing, and I was overcome by the feeling of sparking up a bowl and watching some TV. It was a craving but not one strong enough to really compel me to smoke. I had maybe 2 or 3 more of these feelings in the past year.  

As you all probably know, sleep is an issue in the first week of sobriety. It was hard to fall asleep and stay asleep in that first week. And when sleep was had, the dreams were vivid and intense. However, after the first week, everything returned to normal quite quickly. I really enjoy remembering my dreams now.

My biggest shortcoming was about 3 months ago when I began to increase my alcohol consumption. I began drinking on many weeknights and weekends. I quickly saw that I was beginning to replace marijuana with something much more destructive. I took the right measures and immediately decreased my alcohol consumption, knowing that alcoholism was nothing to fool around with.  

**A Big Thank You:**  I want to thank this awesome community with helping me. You all kept my motivation going in tough times and I thought it was time to repay the favor with my experience.

I don't have a problem with drinking, although alcohol is addictive. But then again, I've never drank every day for an extended period of time. 

Moreover, I'm wondering if the seemingly general consensus (except for those who are in the know, e.g. readers of this subreddit) that weed is a soft drug and ""it's just weed"" makes it feel okay as something to do everyday. Let me explain. For instance, if someone told you ""I drink every day"" or ""YEAH MAN GET DRUNK EVERYDAY WOO"" you would think they have a problem. But replace ""drink"" and ""get drunk"" with ""smoke"" and ""get stoned"", respectively, and these are sentiments shared among a large quantity of people (see: /r/trees). 

It just seems that people try to convey that smoking weed is not a big deal to the point where it's easy to forget that it's harmful, in one way or another, and thus leads many people to run into problems. 

I, for one, was told it's illegal and a ""bad thing"" from a young age, but once I tried it for a while, I realized it's not all that bad. In fact, I became outraged that it was illegal. And I was adamant that it didn't affect me in the ways we all know it does (causes depression, causes grades to slip, etc.) So adamant that I took it upon myself to prove it to the world. And I did that. At least, I managed to do that...for a while. But after a few years I became a statistic.

Have been a medium to high partaker in volcano vape form for anxiety and just cause it's nice (s/o aware and supportive) for the last six years.  Getting increasingly heavy with the last two years a bit of a foggy blur.  Noticed that my drive and motivation is dropping and my energy levels are non existent.  I used to exercise every day, now I just eat crap food and sit around.  I spent a lot of this year worrying about this and needing to find an outlet where I could talk and get advice.  Very glad to have found this subreddit.  I can't admit to friends or family as I have a very hard job requiring a good reputation.  I was working up to quitting but needed a push.  I got one sadly.

Our beautiful baby boy died (v v late term stillbirth) a few weeks ago and our lives have been completely blown apart.  My wife has completely withdrawn into herself and I have been spending as much time as I can high so as not to let the anger and fury at the situation overwhelm me.  Never when I have to be responsible, but as soon as I am home and my daughter is in bed I am on the bag.

My wife is already in counselling and I've got counselling lined up from next week but can't talk to them about this side of things.  Want to quit but am terrified of what I will be like completely clean, as well as the possible side effects of just quitting.  The intensity of the the grief is literally paralysing and I don't know how much the weed is amplifying the anxiety.

I stopped smoking about a week ago, not even on purpose, but just because I didn't want to anymore. Here's how things went for me, hopefully it'll help someone.

**1: Cutting down slowly until you stop**

First, I decided to just smoke in the evenings, which I would have been just fine keeping it that way. I'd still be functional during the day without my daily wake and bake, and could still enjoy some greenery in the evening. I think this helped with willpower a lot, the first week or so I wasn't perfect about it, but by the second week I was only smoking in the evenings, and not every evening either. Going cold turkey might work well for some people, but this helped me a lot.

**2: Replace your addiction**

I've known a lot of people that have tried to quit smoking trees and started smoking cigarettes instead to fill the time, and vice versa as well. Not a good addiction to replace it with. That being said I do enjoy tobacco, and have been smoking slightly more than I was before, but I've never smoked cigarettes, just pipe tobacco or cigars (romeo y julietta makes some fine cigarillos too). Cigarettes are too easy to just grab and smoke. If you have something that takes 20-30 minutes to smoke, you put some thought into it before you light it up. Part of my motivation for not smoking was talking to girls, which for me anyways was next to impossible and probably hilarious to anyone watching. So as an extension of that I decided to get in shape too. Instead of smoking, I get a good buzz off of a nice jog (recently discovered /r/C25K, I'd highly recommend it so far) or using some weights/pushups/chin up bar. My belly is flatter and my body is stronger not only because I'm working out more, but less munchies as well.

**3: Take a break from your stoner friends**

I'm not saying get rid of them, and if they're real friends they'll understand you saying that you don't want to hang out for a week or so just to stop being around weed and get out of that habit. It's hard to sit in a circle and just pass it if you were smoking the day before. Luckily for me I've got plenty of stoner friends, sober friends, and mainly ones that will smoke occasionally. Simply asking them not to smoke around you could be another option, but for some people just being around them could make it more difficult (i.e. when I hang out with this person, I'm usually stoned. Now we're hanging out again, I feel like I should be smoke) Just having some time away from them could help build the willpower to stop, and get you out of the habit.

**4: Want it, visualize it**

You won't stop smoking unless you actually want to. If it's just something you think you should do but aren't whole hearted about it, it probably wont happen. Want to stop smoking, don't think you should, actually want to stop. Visualize yourself in a month as the guy/girl who's clear headed and can talk to people and has a couple hundred extra bucks in their pocket. Compare that to the person you'd be otherwise sitting on the couch getting high all day and not accomplishing anything.

And I guess my point is this, if you're an alcoholic like me, that doesn't mean that anyone else is, that they'll struggle with the same issues surrounding substance abuse, *or even believe that you do.* And if you aren't an addict, *that doesn't mean that addiction and alcoholism aren't very, very real.*  

As with so many things in life, it is irresponsible, and often damaging, to superimpose our experiences onto other people.  By this I mean that just because I experience things a certain way, I can't reliably assume that's how ""everyone"" experiences that same thing.  So please, let's agree to allow everyone their own experiences, and not try to tell an addict that addiction isn't real, or a ""normal"" user that everyone who uses has a problem.  There, I managed to sit still long enough to get that off my chest.

It eventually got to the point to where even right after I smoked, I couldn't make a clear distinction between high me and sober me.  But I continued out of habit/resisting change.  I told myself several times ""When this bag runs out I'm not buying anymore!"" and then as soon as I was dry I would break down and buy again.  
I was finally able to quit for 4 days  starting on the 10th of last month.  Decided to buy a little bit of weed for my girls' birthday on the 15th.  Then said ""What the hell.  I wanna be high on christmas!"" and stayed high till then.  Then I said well I want to be stoned for the new year.  I smoked around 1 bowl or blunt every day during that period (I was used to 4 or 5 blunts a day, plus some bowls in between)  
I figured out that I was always making excuses for myself and that wasn't going to help.  So I decided my new years resolution was to give up weed.  I smoked the last of my stuff last night (My biggest issue was the money I was losing, so I can never bring myself to just throw it away.)

I still struggle when I'm at my favorite bar and a few persistent friends try to get me to smoke, but I have not and will not give in to their pressure.  They seem to be slowly starting to understand that my resolve is strong and that I will not give in to their temptation.

Holy crap, I have so many extremely colorful dreams!  They are so vivid and complex.  I can't believe what I had given up while being stoned all the time.  (And, really, there is no smoking once in a while for me.  I'm an all-or-nothing kind of pot smoker, and I choose ""nothing"".)

For the first time in a number of years, I am actively learning a new trade, and I am making real progress and remembering details that before I would've had to repeat over and over and over.  My vocabulary is getting back to where it should be.  I'm still working on my lung capacity -- wow, I am out of shape from such a sedentary lifestyle, but I'm finally doing something about it by getting out there and exercising regularly.

I am taking a meditation class in which I have been encouraged to sit every day, so I've been trying to take at least 10 minutes every day to meditate.  I haven't succeeded in sitting EVERY day, but more often than not I find time.  Meditation has helped me immensely to calm down and keep mindful throughout the day, and I often find the time right before bed so it helps me be ready for sleep immediately when I lie down.

I told him that I had decided to quit as well and while his roommates passed a blunt around, we took a walk in a nearby park.

It was funny coming back, seeing everyone stoned and thinking that just 2 weeks ago, I would have been one of them, couch-locked and watching t.v. It helped me mentally because being sober around a bunch of high people, you're pretty much invisible. It's like being outside looking in - like you're floating above the clouds that they are drifting away on. You can really see how even a group of pretty good friends hanging out stoned is really just a bunch of different islands, kids living inside their own heads, lost in their own thoughts, occasionally laughing together. That's an over generalization but you get my point. 

It's been about a week now and I feel like my emotions are kind of all over the place. I've been so stoned and dulled out for so long that now my emotions are bouncing around and stuff but i'm sure that will get better the longer I stay away from it.

I know that once you do a drug it opens a door in your mind that can't be closed but I finally know that however I think or feel about the drug, weed just isn't for me. I don't want to get arrested, make late night runs to fast food places, and meet the same kind of people over and over again in some kind of vicious cycle. I'm ready to break out of this fog i've put myself in for the past 2 or so years (with some breaks here and there). 

In the same vain (vein?) i'd like to start working on myself outside of drugs. There are many levels of myself that I need to work out, drugs being the first. I feel more confident than I have in the past about quitting because when I really look inside, I don't see weed being for me, it's never helped me in any way. There was a lot of fun in the past but my body and mind are CLEARLY past those times and weed now just makes me depressed and when I smoke I just wish I hadn't. 

While reaching sobriety I will attempt to tackle my other problems such as depression, my tendency to push people away (i've done this for as long as I can remember), and just being a nicer, better person. I guess one thing that has been encouraging is watching the olympics and seeing all these young, drug free people my age and younger going hard and representing their country. I mean even if your sport is too obscure for tv and you don't win a medal, just imagine being there, imagine the atmosphere, you know? Such high achievement. I want that out of myself even if I'm not the best in the world because I know that I can get over this and i'm sure you can too.

- It's a waste of money. I've spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on marijuana in the past year alone. If I could have kept that money I would have been able to get an apartment and a lot more nice stuff

- It's an anti-social drug if you smoke by yourself.

- My memory is horrible. I constantly find myself forgetting huge things and little things.

- My parents won't respect me if I continue smoking weed

- I need to get better grades.

- I see my friends smoking and doing nothing with their lives. 

- My life is too important to go through in a daze constantly. 



I'm 20 years old. I've been smoking weed everyday mostly since I've been 16. Off and on. In the past 2 years I've gone through horrible depression and I was just using weed to escape. I wasn't even getting high or enjoying it anymore. I was just doing it to not think about how messed up my life was getting. A big reason it was getting so messed up was because I was using marijuana to run away from my problems rather than confronting them head on. Last year I went to Montana State university and failed out because I was too busy smoking weed to bother with school work. I am now at a community college and I'm proud to say I'm starting to get better and better grades. I got two A's and a C+ last semester while smoking weed. This semester I hope to get three A's and I need my memory and a clear head to do so. I'm done smoking weed until I can get my life back in order. 

It's been 10 days since I've smoked and I've never felt better. The first couple of days were rough, but if you even have a lingering thought in your head you should quit, then you should listen to it and do it. It's worth it to feel clear headed for once. I'm tired of having the stoner bags under my eyes and always looking like I'm in a daze.

Lately, I've noticed that every time I smoke, I tend to over-analyze things and have negative thoughts about myself and others. This pattern of thinking really takes a toll on my confidence, which leads to anxiety and depression when I'm not high. I've decided to partake in meditation as my replacement, which I've found to be incredibly helpful for easing stress and anxiety.

After becoming very close to the plant, you experience the stages of grief.

Knowing that what you're going through is normal and apart of a process helps comfort, I believe. 

Denial
This is when you deny that you have a problem. You think, weed isn't addictive. It's just a plant. If they prescribe it to people for medical reasons, it can't be harmful to me or my emotions. 

Anger 
This is the point of quitting where you feel animosity about quitting. This is stupid, I just wanna smoke, etc. For me, I felt anger towards anyone who smoked. I felt like how can they do it and be fine and I can't? I was jealous and sad towards other smokers.

Bargaining
This is where you think, I'll make a deal. I'll only smoke on weekends or at a party. These bargains don't work because it's guaranteed if you do that, you'll start doing it regularly again. 

Depression
This is pretty self explanatory. You have so many negative feelings about yourself and life when you quit. This is TEMPORARY and passes in time guaranteed. Just think of the depression regarding quitting as a step that you will pass. 

Acceptance
Us addicts have a lot of trouble with acceptance. We like to be in control of a lot of things. This is where you need to continually say to yourself, ""I don't smoke weed. I did, and it was harmful to me and my emotions, and now I don't."" Come to terms with your previous dependency and issues. 

Remember that the grieving process is different for everyone. You may skip steps or go through them out of order. It is unique to each person and situation. 

Good luck to everyone.

After lurking this sub for a solid month or so, I realized I may have to quit smoking weed.

All I ever hear is how awesome and good for you weed is, I had no idea there were so many issues with this addiction. Matter of fact, I didn't know I had a problem. 

I have been smoking pot pretty much daily for the past 10 years. Throughout my school life, I was high. And it has crossed over to my work life, where I smoke pretty much everyday before I get into work and when I get out of work and pretty much whenever I can. 

Why suddenly now?

After reading so many posts here, some of these problems are becoming more and more evident especially in the past year...

Poor social skills (I used to be way more outgoing and made friends way easier), gaining some weight because I'm always eating munchies, no dreams (I used to remember every single one), no wit (I used to be hilarious), I look way worse than I used to (baggy, glazed over eyes), losing touch with my siblings because I don't want them to know I smoke weed (I'm always smoking weed), forgetting simple things, I get nothing done (my car/room is a total mess), constantly dwelling in the past instead of moving forward, no ambitions, so lazy, haven't worked out in a while (I used to be pretty fit), cloudy mind, and if I notice more, I'm going to add it here.

Now, I want to be free like you guys. I would to be out of this fog and see clearly. I want to know what it's like to be sober cause I'm not even fucking sure when I'm high anymore. I want to get things done and make something of myself. I want to stop feeling this thing at the pit of my stomach every time I think of the past. FUCK! I just want to be me again.

I just noticed the link on the Front Page about Cannabis withdrawal (http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/10k6f1/cannabis_withdrawal_real_new_study_quantifies_its/) and the comments lead me here. I really hope this will help ease some of your worried minds...

Quick background - started smoking when I was about 15. Continued aggressively smoking up until my senior year at college. Upwards to 5 times a day in the later years. Smoked for every class, everyday at work, for hanging out, for studying, for movies, for walking. Whatever you name, I smoked for it. I was always bright and ahead of the class, always on top of my game, always had a smile on. Never a care in the world.

In my senior year of college, I met a girl I fell madly in love with. So much that during my winter break, I went home to spend the entire month with her. For the first time in my life I NEVER once thought about smoking. I was too wrapped up in her love that nothing else mattered. It wasn't until I returned to school that I realized I hadn't smoke in a month. Woah! Go me, right? No...

I picked up the bong my first day back and immediately had a panic attack. Holy shit...what's wrong with me I thought? Lost control of my thoughts, my feels, my senses, everything. No biggie I thought. Let's go upstairs and rest it off. Next day things felt weird. Disconnected. I wasn't too sure what was happening. This went on for about a week until I thought...""can this have something to do with me not smoking?"" Keep in mind, I never once in about 6 years of heavy smoking thought about stopping. Wasn't an issue for me and I knew when the time was right I would face my demons. Well, this happened to come much sooner than I thought.

I went home and searched throughout the innernettes on ""cannabis/weed/thc withdrawal,"" thinking it had to be some sort of bullshit. Never heard of it, never heard of anyone having it, etc. Turns out I found 1,000's of posts online citing my feelings and essentially paving a road for what was to come. This is when I knew I had to stop &amp; this shit was real. I had smoked a couple more times since I got back to school and each time getting worse and worse. This was the key to my locked door. Now was the time. I felt the angst creeping up over me like an abysmal wave wanting to trap me in its arms for eternity. I had ""the fear"" as Hunter would say.

The month following that was the worst month of my life. I lost my sense of feeling, which was replaced with sheer anxiety. I lost the love for my girlfriend, my family, my music &amp; my friends. Instead, I worried about death &amp; how insignificant I was. I even lost my sexuality. I lost everything that felt like anything. I was merely a shadow at this point. It was fucking hard. I read &amp; read &amp; read stories of others online to give me some shred of hope. I cried &amp; cried &amp; cried every single day over this fucking nightmare that haunted me every second. I must add though that it was around this time that I was able to open up to my GF and let her know what was happening. If I was a believer, I'd say she was an angel, but I don't, so I will say she was the best fucking friend in the world. She is credited to my entire recovery. I am so thankful to have had her during this time. I can't stress enough how much it helped to talk to someone close about this.

Once she was on board, she was determined to help me build my life back together. About 3-4 months later was when I graduated college. The anxiety was still strong at this point, but no longer overbearing. It took a solid 2 months after my first panic attacked induced smoke to convince myself I didn't lose my mind. This does not include the month clean I spent on winter break. I call that the pre-horror! I was now exercising daily, using the sauna, taking fish oil pills &amp; St. Johns Wart. I can not attest if any of those things worked or not. I feel like it was only time, but who knows. Anyway...once I graduated college I went back home, got a job, and continued on continuing on. I was by no means myself, but I was at least able to convince others I was at this point. 

As time went on, the reality that I had faced seemed more and more surreal. As if it never happened. As if I had read it in a book. My favorite book. A book I read 100 times. I was familiar with every turn of event, but since it's only a story, couldn't actually feel the dilemma of the characters. This is how my 6 months - 1 year was. I was starting to get happy. Starting to smile again. Starting to lose sense of this nightmare I had created for myself. It was no longer hard or a struggle, but the scars were the only thing left that still hurt.

So now, here I am more than 3 years later. I live with the same amazing beautiful girl I fell in love with who helped me turn my life around. I love her more than I ever did and she still holds the plaque for the best fucking friend in the entire world. She is my everything. I have a great job that pays me well &amp; keeps me interested. We have a puppy on the way and life is just peachy keen. 

I'm sorry for the novel, but I've been struggling to get this down in words for some time now. This was the opportunity. I wish I knew about Reddit 3 years ago let alone /r/Leaves. This is exactly what I needed then &amp; I am humbled to know others have it now. I would just like to add that I never even considered smoking during my withdrawal, given the circumstances. I was scared shitless. So, that was never an issue for me &amp; I'm sorry for those of you that have to struggle with that. I hope the individuals who are fearing for their lives because they feel they've lost themselves will find solitude &amp; comfort in my post. You are &amp; never were alone in this. There are 100's &amp; 100's of posts just like mine out there that showed me the way and helped pull me out of myself. I hope I can impact one person in the same way I was impacted by many others.

Thank you for taking the time to read this &amp; just know you're not insane. You are simply reprogramming your brain. That is all.

-Month 1: Horrible anxiety, nightmares, depression. Mainly feeling disconnected from myself. I was nothing of who I used to be.
-Months 2-3: Acknowledged this was the withdrawal and knew I had to wait it out. Began pushing the delusions aside knowing that in time they would pass. Still felt worried and uneasy during this phase, but was starting to get some relief with each and every week.
-Months 4-6: Was on the fast track to recovery. never relapsed, never considered it. Had my social life back and was beginning to rebuild myself. The worst part about this phase was my tension. I clenched my jaw every night and began developing some serious headaches and pains as a result. This was a byproduct of the anxiety I was getting over.
-Months 6-12: Was feeling great. All the perks everyone talked about quitting were sinking in. My GF hated fighting with me because I remembered every tiny detail of what happened :) I was sharp, confident and ready to go!

I tell my self it's fine because it doesn't effect me, I have a good job, finished college, my husband doesn't really mind and my family smokes. But do I even see my real potential and what I'm capable of through a cloud that has always surrounded me? I was surrounded by it growing up. My mom smokes and so do my brothers and it has been the social norm for as long as I remember. We get together to smoke, have a tea and smoke. Christmas dinner doesn't start till we've shared a  blunt. I don't know what else regular families do if they don't smoke. My friends and I bond over it. But I want more. My husband is my inspiration he's support me weather I do or don't but we want a baby and it's not fair to bring a child let alone his child into the world like this. He and I strives to be and eat healthy but I keep telling myself pot is ok. 

I tried to tell my mom I wanna quit and she turned up her nose at me. She makes me feel so guilty. If i wanna give it up I have to give up time with her too. My friends (long time bunners) and my brothers support me but its hard to feel like I'm losing my mom. 

So I'm one week today, and its hard but I'm changing all my habits. I've removed it all from my room, not a single roach in the house but its hard. I'm trying to busy myself with other things and keep my priority in mind. I really want a baby.

I don't have many to talk to and my husbands not a bunner so he doesn't really understand. I need some support so I can do this. I want to do this. I have to do this.

I was 15, and there was so much I hadn't been exposed to. I had never drank or done any drugs, I had never had sex, I had never been outside of California, I had no reference point for so many things. And I remember, vividly, how earth-shattering it was to be face-to-face with the relativity of my own consciousness, the universe, and the concept of infinity in relation to my own being.

That's what smoking weed used to be for me. I would smoke, on occasion, as a way of taking a step back and shifting my consciousness into a more objective plane. It helped formulate my current view of the universe, and subsequent psychedelic adventures have catapulted that perspective.

Not only that... Weed helped me see different sides of my own being, which has affected my personal development in drastic ways... Mostly for the better. 

At least at first.

Then, the occasional smoke -- which to my adolescent mind was always incredibly profound -- evolved into a daily habit. The perspective-shifting, consciousness-expanding properties of the plant gave way to chemical dependency. I began to NEED to smoke, because my sober perspective was so boring. I ALWAYS wanted to be overwhelmed by reality. Even now, two weeks sober, I think about smoking a blunt and how it would make me BLAST OFF into the ethos, connecting me with the universe and liberating me from the shackles of my subjective, earthly point of view. (Not to mention I'd laugh and eat Cheezits and have the time of my life)

I know I sound like a hippie dippy fuck right now, but this is honestly the one thing that makes me keep coming back to the plant. Especially after I haven't smoked for a few weeks, I realize deep down that if I DID smoke, my lack of any tolerance would make me blast off into another reality. I have an adventurous spirit, and because I'm stuck here in this room because of finance and the chains of responsibility, the easiest and most convenient path to adventure is through THC.

So let me ask you this... How do I take a step back without weed? Or without any psychedelics for that matter? 

Yoga? Meditation? How do I feed this hunger for otherworldly experiences?

My gut tells me I need to travel. And I'm going to travel soon, for an extended period of time. But still, deep down, I know that even as I sit atop some mountain in China looking down on what the world has become, I'll be thinking ""wow, this would be even more amazing if I was stoned"".

I'm 31, smoked weed everyday morning, noon, and night for 10 years plus. I quit December 28th 2012, and just went straight cold turkey and haven't had a hit since. The first week was a little rough; hard to sleep, appetite was off, and I had what I can only describe as momentary panic attacks throughout the day at work if I got stressed. But, after a couple weeks, I rarely thought about it, after a month, I *never* thought about it unless someone else mentioned it, and now, I honestly have zero interest in ever smoking again and don't care if I do again. But make no mistake, I had tried to quit many times before that and *failed*. This time I think I was just finally ready after reading a lot of things here and thinking it over.

For me, it never affected my career, as I was already quite successful, so I wondered if quitting for me would actually make my work life harder, or make things worse. But it hasn't. Everything has gotten better at work; more focused, not surfing the web and wasting time anymore, and getting things done far quicker than I used to since I don't doddle anymore. But for me, the reason I quit was my personal time, and how it was spent. Too much time getting high, and once I was high I did nothing but play video games, surf the web, and worst of all, spend hours on Reddit accomplishing *nothing*. I squandered my personal time, when what I really wanted to do was play guitar and piano, juggle more, and read more books. But as soon as I smoked weed after getting home... it was easier to just sit in front of the computer or the TV, or take a nap or something.

I was tired of that. Now that I've been sober; I read, I play guitar, I play piano, I go out more, and I'm doing a lot more things that I find productive in my life than just having another night/week/month/year of getting high and saying shit like ""... I'll quit NEXT month""... some people can smoke weed and be productive. I could smoke weed and establish a great career on it, but I couldn't spend my free time the way I wanted.

I actually deleted my Reddit account shortly after quitting weed. Re-signed up because I had some downtime at work recently, but already realizing posting on the internet and reading forums/aggregate sites just isn't for me anymore and I'm gonna delete this account to and be done with it. I have better things I could be doing, but wanted to drop my fellow leaves members a little nudge of support, and a congrats to those who have already quit.

Thanks for all the motivational posts. Helped me to see my own reasons to quit and move on from weed and my own life in other ways. This is a great subreddit, don't let anyone tell you any differently!

This is my first post on reddit ever, my roommates told me about this forum and I was very interested as I have recently made this lifestyle change about a half a year ago.  My relationship with pot started when I was about 21, I had never seen or been around people who smoked in my life up until that point.  Little did I know that would be the beginning of a very beneficial and destructive six years of my life.  When I first started out I was a pretty casual user but by the time I was 25 26 I was smoking multiple times a day everyday.  I was even growing illegally and selling for a short time.  
    The reason I quit has to do with a promise I made to myself after a childhood friend committed suicide.  This friend had just gotten out of the navy and had moved back to live in the same city as me.  He became a heavy pot smoker just like me.  I was so into my own habit and world and numbed out from everything that I couldnt see how hard he was struggling and I left him  basically to his own devices.  Then a little over a year ago I got the call that he had shot himself.  My response was to get extremely high and numbed out whenever and as often as I could.  
    Then in February  I picked up my phone and I called my friends dad.  It was a hard phone call because I know his dad pretty well he used to take me and his son pheasant and deer hunting and he taught me so much.  We both cried and I told him how much I loved and cared for his son and how the world is worse off because he was gone.  After hanging up the phone I went straight to my grow closet and I ripped up my pot plants that were just entering flowering stage and I shoved them into a garbage sack and I quit smoking from that day on and told myself I wouldnt smoke for a year.
  And you know something this pledge and promise I made to myself is all the more important because of all the promises and pledges I broke when I was smoking really heavily.  For all the times that I was too checked out or too paranoid to ""be"" in the moment with friends or family.  Like the time that I told my now dead grandfather that I couldnt see him when he was in town because I was too ""busy."" Too busy being high.  
  Im sorry this is so long and convoluted I've never put into words what I have just written.  Im glad this resource exists and that you and I can share what to me has been an amazing journey of self discovery.

1305517966.0,45,self.leaves,hca45,I was slipped a huge amount of PCP last weekend. I went through hell.  AMA,,54,9,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hca45/i_was_slipped_a_huge_amount_of_pcp_last_weekend_i/,"Ok, so... where to begin? I guess at the beginning.

I went over to a friend of a friend's house to smoke some weed with him last weekend. I had hung out with him half a dozen times or so, but never one on one. He was a nice dude and everything, and I had no reason to be suspicious. The only thing I thought was weird about him were his ideas about different drugs, saying that they were almost all as harmless as weed. We had had that conversation, and I told him that, while I was open minded with lots of things and don't care what other people do with themselves, there were just a few things that I would absolutely never do. One in particular was PCP.

I got to his house late Friday and smoked a couple joints with him. The last one he went to his room to roll up, which I thought was weird, but eh, no big deal. Right? Wrong. I drove home friday night and went to sleep, because we were having a mother's day dinner the next day. Saturday, I woke up and went downstairs, and I remember feeling a little funny. I remember having a conversation with my cousin and in the middle of our convo, I switched topics completely. I remember realizing that it was weird, and I was confused, but still tried to make sense of it, so I kept on going. The last thing I remember before I lost it was my dad suggesting that I go to bed in a very concerned way. Apparently I kept coming back downstairs and getting stranger and stranger, until my aunt volunteered to stay with me in my room and make sure I didn't leave.

After this, I have no concept of time. There are very few things I remember, but all of it was really fucked up. I remember talking to a man in the mirror, and having an argument about something. Then I realized that this guy looked just like me! How could that be...? Look again, and wtf, thats just me, in the mirror. ""No,"" the man says, ""Fuck you, I'm a different person!"" My reaction is, oh yeah duh. We kept on talking. This happened several times. The only other thing I remember is tearing page after page out of some book, because I needed notebook paper, and I couldn't find it in there. Turns out, that book was a 30th anniversary present from my dad to my mom, with pictures of them all through their happy marriage. I destroyed it.

There are many other thing's I've been told that I did, lots of it stupid, some of it scary. I almost died that night. I was still loopy on Sunday as well.

The worst part of all of this is how badly I frightened my family. I put them through something that I would never wish upon anyone. They had to watch their son/ older brother acting psychotic and completely out of his mind. There are other things about it, but there is so much that I'll just wait for the questions and answer what I can. Let me know if there is any other basic information you want to know and I'll put it up here.

TL;DR: I was slipped PCP, tried to hurt myself, went psychotic, and scared the everliving fuck out of everyone who cares about me. AMA.

**EDIT**: For those who might be interested in more details:  There are only two things I remember personally.  At one point I was talking to this guy on the other side of the mirror.  I wasn't talking to myself, I was (in my mind) literally talking to someone on the other side of the mirror.  It was a little confusing, especially because I had no idea I was hallucinating.  I went through three cycles:  Talking to the stranger in the mirror, then talking to the person and thinking, ""This guy looks *just like me*.  Then realizing wtf, That is me, wtf am I doing.  Then the person would literally say, each time, ""Fuck you dude, what are you talking about?""  And I would think oh yeah, that's weird, why did I think that was me?

The second thing I remember was looking through this notebook, trying to find notebook paper.  Specifically college ruled paper, I dont know why.  I was tearing out pages looking for the paper.  What I was doing in reality was shredding a book my dad made for my mom as their 30th anniversary present.  I shredded it completely.  It was a book full of pictures of them thruought their entire relationship, and it was very well done, and it was one of her favorite possessions.

As for the things I don't remember:  I was digging in the toilet trying to find my dog.  I tried to cut the tattoo out of my chest with a kitchen knife because I said it ""didn't fit right"".  I tried to cut my finger off because I thought my fingernail was broken.  I took everything out of the pantry and placed them all over the house in random places.  We are still trying to find most of it.  I took off all my clothes in front of my entire family because I was ""too warm"".  

I also wrote a note, which was very morbid and surprisingly lucid and comprehensible.  I can transcribe it here if anyone is interested.

I entered college after being sheltered my whole life. Got introduced to weed. Became mentally/habitually ""addicted"" to weed. Basically married Mary Jane. Second semester comes around, get busted by housing police and cops. Keep smoking the rest of the year. Basically an 1/8th a day. Blew life savings. Grades went to shit. All my friends made indirectly/directly through pot. Come home from college. Parents find out. Legal repercussions follow. They threatened to pull me out of school if I didn't stop + girlfriend threatened to break up with me if I didn't stop. Stopped. Stopped again. Stopped again. Actually stopped June 1, 2012. Still remember my last joint :'( .

I didn't stop willingly. I stopped because I had to. I don't think pot is a ""bad drug"". I still love pot and think about it all the time. It hasn't been easy. I truly believe in its medical properties and the good it can do for society, but I've also come to terms with the fact that I abused it and that it's not something that I, myself, can afford to do at this point in my life. I never would have thought in a million years that I'd make it to my 1 year mark.

If anyone has any questions/ wants advice I'm glad to share with you more of my experience.
Stopping isn't as easy as ""just stopping"" like most people think. I've watched too many of my friends say that they're taking a break to get their grades up or apply for jobs and fall right back into it only a few days later.
Hopefully my story can help other ents who are looking for guidance who need to stop for reasons beyond their control (i.e. jobs, parents, probation, etc.)

I had been smoking for about 2 years up until the beginning of the 2013 calendar year.

Ganja *helps me relax*, as it's intended to. It also *helps me play music naturally* rather than stress out trying to write something. It can *make my conversation flow so smooth*, you'd never think I had social anxiety. 

It also *removes my sense of inhibition*, which isn't always a good thing. It originally helped me write music but *ended up drastically changing my style  of writing* all together. *I gained weight, became more impulsive and less responsible*. Simply put, it makes me **regress**. It's also made my body and mind feel slow and, in turn, has made me feel...well...""old"" (as in, maybe too old for all this silly shit...)

My own history is much like many other. I started smoking recreationally when I was about 15 and as I got further into adulthood, it has gotten much more serious. I usually say that I only smoke a little before bed, and that I virtually never smoke socially.... and that is true to a point.

The whole truth is that I have become dependent on marijuana. The type of thing I always insisted wasn't possible. It dominates so much of my thoughts. I work a straight job about 50 hours a week and haven't ever gone in high once in at least 4 years. That's no problem. But when I get home, I must get high. If I have a day off, I must get high. Playing a game or watching a movie? I must get high.

The control this substance has over me has become incredible. When I get low on pot, I get extraordinarily nervous and worried about how I can get more. I never ever run out; I always re-up before my stash is close to empty. I battled a cocaine and crack addiction years ago and kicked it without 12-step or any type of support. I slowly grew an epiphany that those drugs were killing me. I used pot as a less harmful crutch to ease the quitting process. I am gladly 5 years clean of everything but pot.

But, I have been growing a new set of epiphanies. I read something on here months back that shifted my perspective. It said that while most people consider there to be virtually no negative impact from sustained marijuana use, there is one big thing and it is huge: Marijuana makes it okay to do absolutely nothing.

I cannot abide this lack of control over my life any longer. I'm feeling pretty positive right now. I made the decision to quit just last night while I was stoned. It was easy to say, then. I know that I can grow beyond it, but I find that as much as there is a necessity to quit that I have no desire or want to do so. None at all. I love getting high.... Don't I? I can't remember what a day is like without it, so how can I know anymore?

It is hard doing something that you need to but hate hate hate the idea of. I want to thank the /r/leaves community for already having helped me reach this point.

My first post in Leaves, and I just want to mention how reassuring this subreddit has been in the past few days. Any doubt I have about quitting is quickly diminished when I check in here.

My mental clarity, memory, social skills, and dreams are all coming back in full force!

My emotions are no longer confined to the small range that daily toking had brought me to. I can feel the numbness fading, and real, moving emotion is taking hold again.

Yes, there is sadness that comes back, but I can no longer just ignore the things that cause the sadness. It's past time to stop turning to cannabis for an escape from emotion and responsibility.

I'm ready for a change in my life, and this is what I've needed.

Thank you /r/leaves, and may all of you find encouragement here just as I have.

Stopping smoking pot, or vaporizing it in my case, came as another falling domino in the midst of a mid life crisis, and for a long time the act of doing it has been more out of necessity than out of fun.   

The problem isn’t that I love pot; it’s that everything that comes with it isn’t what I want in my life anymore.  It’s contributed to a lot of the same anti-social tendencies that others here seem to have been experiencing as well.  I feel like if I never smoked again it would be all right and I wouldn’t really miss it.  It’s the tenseness that’s surfacing, along with all the problems in my life that I’ve been putting on the back burner all finally bubbling up to the surface.   All the things that didn’t bother me so much before are really bothering me now.    I feel like I should be changing my entire life.

Another part of why I stopped was because of money problems.  I’ve got a mortgage that I’ve been tenuously holding on to for more than a decade, and my career is not going so well.   I’m freelance, and have been having rough times with the company I freelance for, and today I nearly got fired after a tense email exchange in which I was trying to find out when I would be getting paid.  If I had been smoking pot today, I probably would have let it all slide a little further as I have in the past.

I’ve been a music lover all of my life and I sometimes feel like I’m going to miss out on something great because I am not listening with the same (stoned) ears that I’ve been listening with since the 90s.

With all this said, I still feel like I can leave my pot use in the past, although my favorite music festival is fast approaching.   I’m not quite planning on being completely sober, but pot is likely off the menu.

One good thing in my life that seems to be helping is that I’ve been hitting the gym and exercising a lot, mostly because I want to be in good shape for the big music festival.   I’m not muscular yet, but I am feeling physically a lot better and I’ve dropped close to 15 pounds.  

I suppose I should wrap this up for now.  If you read all this, thanks for letting me vent.  I know this is all over the place.

It’s really good that this subreddit is here.

After a decade, I've made some amazing frients, and my relationships with them are a large part of why I've continued smoking well into my (successful ((#humblebrag))) professional career.

Over the holidays, I hung out with a friend of mine who is in his first year post law school, working at his dream job doing capital appeals in NOLA. He's been my sesh-buddy since freshman year of college, so when I asked him if he wanted to blaze with me, ""You know, to take the edge off."" I was very surprised to hear him respond, ""Nah Man, I'm trying to sharpen my edge"" and politely decline.

I haven't smoked since he told me that. It made me realize that I stopped loving getting high a long time ago, but my brain was locked into a physical addiction. There's a much greater satisfaction in having the mental acuity to define and fulfill your dreams.

Whenever I get the urge I close my eyes, take a few slow breaths, and tell that part of my brain that wants to be dulled that it no longer has control over my situation.

1340122321.0,39,self.leaves,va4qm,Progress report: Day 365,sooibot,44,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/va4qm/progress_report_day_365/,"Let me preface this wall of text with the following; I'm writing this mostly for myself, if you find it useful, that's an added bonus. Also, this kind of thing is usually ""required"", since well, it's something of a milestone. Oh, and I swear sometimes.

I could go into my life story here, and in detail explain everything, I won't, don't worry, not because it's boring, but because it's kind of trivial now. I learnt very quickly on my path that trying to find your similarities in a story to somehow validate the message invariably dilutes it if it doesn't fit your own, so I'll keep this part short. I'm 27 years old, well educated, well cared for. I'm a know-it-all, an underachiever, unmotivated and introverted. 

I went through school always feeling like I'm on the outside. I never belonged is pretty cliche, but that's how I felt. I made friends easily, although I never truly let them know the real me, because I somehow felt that the real me wasn't good enough. Eventually, I did make good friends, and they are my friends to this day. I was bullied, mostly verbally and emotionally, but I quickly learnt that I bruise too easily (on a psycological level). I developed a sharp tongue to defend myself, and also a viewpoint that most people are just fucked up.

I used quite late in my schooling, and didn't really get too stuck into it. I was mostly into gaming though, my first real addiction. I had withdrawels from games when I went on holiday one year, cold sweats, nightmares, irratibility. I didn't think too much of it then, I see differently now. University was a dream for me, I wanted to get away from my parents, who fought, every night, all the time. Here, I started drinking and smoking pot heavily. I partied. A. Lot. It was normal? No, I failed. I did NOTHING but have fun, no contrast to working, fun became the normal, and eventually, I stopped having fun.

Things happened. My relationships were toxic. My habit slowly grew. After my parents divorced, I was smoking everyday, all the time. This daily thing went on for about 3 years, I did eventually pass my degree, but not my Honors. I could've done my Masters, it is within my capabilities. I lost two jobs. I have a shit-ton of debt. I was filled with regret. I fantasized about suicide. I hated myself. I needed a change.

I did the whole rehab thing. I wasn't going to fuck this up as well, so I made two promises to myself; ""For us is not to question why, for us is but to do or die"", and no more lying to myself. The rehab wasn't just a 28 day stint, but a primary, followed by a 3 month secondary, then 2 months in a ""transition"" house. I went to hundreds of meetings. The meetings were great, I took every opportunity to speak up. I've done going to psychologists my whole life, but group therapy helped me more than I could ever realized. There's something about realizing that you're not as fucked up as you think, and there are others like you, that actually boosts it a lot.

I realized that drugs and booze aren't my only problems. First and foremost, I have a self-esteem problem. I struggle with anything that gives me pleasure, because I seek it without thinking, without caring for myself first. I have intimacy issues. I have father issues. I have group issues. I seek out being bored, lonely, angry and shameful because I use those emotions to justify using something, anything... It invariably leads me to being bored, lonely, angry or shamed, which is just the cycle repeating itself.

I had to learn to love myself first. To forgive myself. To let go of my regrets, let go of my delusions, and rediscover myself. I had to change my entire mindset. Some quickly pounce on 12-stepping as brainwashing, but who the fuck cares if it is? My brain was fucked up enough. My best thinking got my to the lowest point in my life, and I was incapable of getting myself out of it in the mindset I was in. I had to look at life differently, at people differently, at myself differently.

Slowly, things changed. I went through the usual stages of loss, and then, the honeymoon phase where I was on a pink cloud. After that, I hit the wall. Is this is? Is this bland, normal, responsible way of life, life? I became depressed easily. Things would come up, my relationships, my parents, my friends, my siblings. I cried. A. Lot. One day I recounted the story of myself carrying the still warm carcass of my dog, run over in front of me in the street, when I was 6. It's one of my earliest memories. I fucking bawled my eyes out for 3 hours straight. It was on of the best experiences of my life.

For most of the people reading this, what I did was intensive. It was everyday, wake up, therapy, lunch, therapy, supper, meeting, therapy. It's not for everyone. When I was done, I could easily become a counsellor. I didn't, fuck that. I had to get back into society. I had to see my friends (who all still party). I had to move on with my life. So I did. I'm not nearly independent yet, but I have made progress in that. I got a job, something that I work hard at.

I started going out. I love dancing, so I did that too. Now, if someone says being in a club sober is hard, try dancing... Weird as shit. But I did it, and had fun. I started to have more and more fun. Now, I can go out with friends, and when the ""party gets heavy"", I remove myself. No point staying up past 1am popping pills or smoking bongs. I can have fun without using, this, was a huge revelation. 

I got involved with a girl. Big fucking mistake. Since, well, she had a boyfriend at the time, and she was crazy as batshit (I seem to attract those... another story entirely, but big part of my White Knight issues). She fucked with my head completely, and very nearly broke me down. When they said no relationships in the first year, I scoffed, now I know. She did reveal to me that it's possible for me to chat girls up when I'm sober, and also... ahem.. carrying on.

I started to love myself. To build up my self-esteem. Previously mentioned girl even said that I'm so cool, I have my shit together. No-one has ever said that to me before. For the first time in my life, I'm doing stuff for myself. If I have a problem with someone or something, I talk about it, I don't let it fester. A lot of this might just be termed as ""growing up"", but for me, it's a motherfucking huge deal. Does it get easier? Hell yeah it does. Do you think about smoking less? Well, it's only been a year, and 4 years ago I broke up from my first love, and I still think about her, so I think I'll be thinking about Mary Jane for a while still.

Did I love weed? Yeah I did, and I still do, all I know now is that I can't love myself and justify smoking. For me to justify it, I need to find everything wrong in the world, think about everything sad, lame people, fucked up shit... and use it to bring myself down. I'm so insignificant. I'm so useless. I'm so depressed. Let's just smoke!

I don't do that anymore. Why? Because it's a fucking waste of time. Time is the most precious thing to me on this earth, and I'm done wasting it. I don't let stupid shit bother me, because why care about something I have no control over?

When 4/20 rolled around a couple months ago, I got really upset because I knew I wouldn't be getting high, and I was bummed for days afterward. I know that the whole 420 concept is kind of a silly thing, and I was a bit ashamed to feel so crabby over a decision I knew was right, but it used to be a special time that I shared with friends, and I missed that. I felt like EVERYBODY ELSE in the WHOLE WORLD was having SO MUCH FUN and it WASN'T FAIR. Very juvenile, I know.

ANYWAY! So here's what I did to cheer myself up: Every day that I notice that 4:20pm is coming up, I try to set it up that I'm doing something that I really like when those numbers hit the clock. I'll get a piece of chocolate ready, or put on one of my favorite songs, or go outside and enjoy the view, or make a doodle, or tickle my daughter, or lay on the floor and stretch, or take a bath or WHATEVER. I try to make sure I have something to smile over, even if it's just thinking a happy thought.

This works for me because it reminds me that I smoked weed because it made me feel good, but weed was not the ONLY thing that makes me feel good.

""Best"" being highly subjective based on responses and upvotes.  Nothing I am saying here is law; just what seems to be most accepted.  Everyone is different, these are just my opinions based experience, both my own and this group's general outlook.  

**On deciding to quit:**

""I don't think I need to quit.  My life is great.""   That is fine.  No one here is going to try to change your mind.  We are not evangelists.  Most of us are pro-legalization.  Most of here believe weed is fine for those that can handle it.   We are a support group, not a movement. 

However, if you feel you are not as happy as you should be and that your desire to be high a lot is part of the problem, then come on in and share your story.  

Not everyone needs to quit, but if the thought has crossed your mind, it should be explored.  If you tried to quit and failed, it is a good sign that you should hunker down and try again. 

If you are quitting because of legal issues, parental/spousal issues, drug screens, or other external factors, cold turkey is the only way to go.  

Extra credit: Without googling, does anyone know where the term 'cold turkey' comes from?

**On quitting:**

The best time to quit is right now.  Not after you finished this bag, not after the concert Saturday, not when I go away on vacation next month, not tomorrow morning, not after I move home from the dorm, etc.  People will rationalize the flexibility of any deadline.  

Once you make the decision, get rid of all the accessories. Flush your stash, throw out your stash box, your pipes, your bongs, your vapes etc.   ""But that piece cost me x dollars!""  Too bad, you already got your money's worth.  ""But I have had that dugout since junior high!""  It is not sentimental, it is a resin covered, stinky piece of a former life.  

Get used to the idea that you are now a non-smoker, not a former smoker, not a smoker on a break, and non-smokers don't have paraphernalia.  

If applicable, delete your dealer's phone number. 

NOTE:  Some folks advocate for a tapering or weaning approach.  By all means, if you don't have a deadline, give it a try.   If you succeed, that is great.  It seems the majority of folks here cannot pull that off.  A hard stop, aka ""cold turkey"", is usually preferred here, but that is not a rule, just the group's experience.  You do whatever works for you.  If you don't succeed, try a different approach. 

**On withdrawal symptoms:**

You may or may not experience some mental and physical discomforts. They vary in intensity and duration.  21 days seems to be a common refrain around these parts, but your mileage will vary.   

The physical issues you will likely run into are sleep disturbances, appetite issues, nausea, headaches, coughing, gastric issues, and dandruff. (OK, I made the last one up to see who is still reading.)

The mental issues include cravings, depression, anxiety, vivid nightmares, lethargy, and everyone's favorite, irritability.  

So many have come here swearing up and down that no one has ever become addicted to weed.  Then they go through withdrawal and change their mind.  This is not like heroin or alcohol by a long shot.  No one is saying it compares.  But there are a lot of folks who suffer through the first couple of weeks. 

I think the irritability is the most universal.  Part of it is chemically based, but part is the frustration that you can no longer just take a hit and make your problems magically go away and part is the frustration that there are most likely few people you can talk to about what you  are going through and fewer that will be sympathetic.  ""I am doing something really hard and no one cares what I am going through!""   That is where you need this forum.  We understand and will offer support and advice.  

**On smoking buddies**

""I just divorced weed and now I am in a custody battle over my friends.""   There is no one answer for this, but it will take some soul searching.  If the only thing you have in common with these folks is smoking, you need to move away from the herd.   Quitting is most successful when you can change your people and places.  But that is not always possible.  Handle the situation carefully.   You do not want to come off as judgemental or preachy.   There is truth to the adage that there is nothing worse than a reformed anything. 

Your friends may be suspicious or resentful of you leaving the bud club. Many people feel better about there habit when it is validated by their friends.  Your change in direction can make them feel forced to examine where they are and cause some insecurity or frustration.  Be mindful of that and don't take any too personally if they seem aloof. 

""I told my friend(s), whatever you do, don't let me smoke!""  Don't do this.  Don't put the burden of your struggle on their shoulders.  It is unfair.  

""Everyone in my house smokes! It is too hard to quit.""  It does make it tougher.   But believe it or not, you have the strength and intelligence to still make it happen.  The fact that you came to this forum shows that you are interested in your mental health.  It is not beyond anyone's capability.  But no one said it was easy.  Be kind to yourself.  Don't assume you are a failure before you start.  

**On staying quit**

Failures most often occur when you depend on will power alone.  You need to plan ahead for the triggers and temptations you know you will face.  Failing once or twice can give you a vivid picture of what those are:

""I had the worst day at work.""

""My SO is being a jerk.

""I am going to a Phish concert.""

""Dan is coming back to visit this weekend, so I gotta splurge.""

etc.  

The number one cited excuse is ""I am freaking bored!"" 

You will have a lot of free time now.  You need to plan ahead to fill it.   Best undisputed answer: Exercise.  Lots of it, preferably outdoors if possible.  Other valid pursuits: Reading, meditation, yoga, hobbies, cleaning and organizing, create a list of projects you have procrastinated about in the past and start checking them off.  The list goes on.   In general, if it is productive, builds self esteem, and fills time, it is a great idea. 

Things to avoid:  Cross addicting to alcohol, cigarettes, or any other drug. Things you used to do high like video games or mindless TV watching.   Or anything else that puts you in your own little world with nothing to show for it.  

""I quit and now I feel worse than I did.""  If you were using weed to medicate an underlying depression, there is a good chance you might feel worse.  Remember you quit for some reason and going backwards is not the answer.   Try to treat your depression differently.   Vigorous frequent exercise, a proper diet and a regular sleep schedule are the first things to try.  Meditation, yoga, talk therapy, self-help books are all non-invasive ways to work on your mental health.  And if all else fails, start working with your doctor and try some meds.  It might take a couple of tries, and you still have to maintain the exercise, diet and sleep, but pills can be quite effective.  

""But aren't I just trading one drug for another?""   Yes, but antidepressants, if needed, are legal, will not cause you to fail a drug test, are usually covered by insurance, and they are standardized, consistent and readily available with a prescription.  No pharmacist has ever said, ""I am still looking for some Luvox, but it has been really dry lately.  I found a guy, but the quality was bunk.""  

I am not pushing pills.  But there are times where they may be required and effective. 

**On temptations:**

You will be tempted.  Weed is pervasive in our culture.   From TV shows and movies, the news, personal interactions,  weed comes up a lot.  Think about what you will do if tempted.  My best advice is to think it through.  Yes, feeling that smoke hit your lungs will feel good.  Then that familiar buzz comes on.  Ahhh.  But what happens after that?  The crash, the munchies, the lethargy, the desire for more...that last one is the dangerous one.  It can pull you back into the whole cycle quicker than most people thought.   

Is one hit going to turn you back into a 7x24 stoner?  Of course not.  But maybe it goes well and you think you can now handle your habit.   So you partake again the next week.   Still no big deal and you are so confident that you think you could buy a bag and keep it around for special occasions.   After a while your idea of a special occasion changes from a One Direction concert (or whatever you young people listen to these days, with your dubstep and whatnot) to ""I need to get high before I face the supermarket.""

The feeling was incredible, and the way it made everything so much more exciting and enjoyable was definitely worth the investment. It was the summer after I graduated high school that I started smoking after breaking my leg at the beach and being confined to my home. I still remember inviting a few of my buddies to try it with me for the first time. We had a blast.

It started out as a very infrequent thing. I would invite some people over every couple weeks when my parents were gone and we'd try to create new ways to smoke (making a gravity bong in my kitchen sink blew my mind at the time). Eventually, however, I moved off to college where my habits gradually changed.

At first, it was fine. I bought my own $30 pipe so I could smoke at night after I finished all my schoolwork. I didn't really click with my roommates at the time, so I made serious efforts to keep my smoking discreet for the first couple months by going away and smoking in private in my parked car or outside or something. But as time went on, I never really adapted to the college lifestyle - I had no friends and was not involved in anything on campus (or off, really) so I found myself occupying my downtime with weed. My late-night smoking turned into as-soon-as-I-got-back-from-class smoking, which I considered acceptable at the time because I was still doing well in school. By my second semester, I was high pretty much from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to sleep, regardless of classes. Before, I could spend $20 on a gram of some dank and have it last me a week at least, but by this point I was going through an eighth a week easily.

Throughout the first year of college, I struggled with depression that now I think stemmed from my anti-social behavior. Weed helped me cope, but after a while it was less about making me feel happy and more about making me forget I was sad.

My second year of school, I moved into an apartment with 3 random guys that went to school with me. At this point smoking was a regular part of my lifestyle, so learning these guys smoked was awesome and they turned into really great friends of mine. Over this year, my smoking habits increased as I always had someone with me that wanted to smoke. Financially it wasn't too bad, but only because I was selling pot with these guys so that we could all smoke for essentially free. The first semester went by relatively smoothly. My grades weren't great, but they were fine. I didn't go to class much, but went enough to get the gist of what was going on. Two of my roommates got arrested towards the end of that first semester of the year, so they had to quit smoking for probationary reasons. It should have convinced me to stop smoking, but they would still sit in on our sessions (albeit with their disgusting fake bake stuff) so I never really considered it. It did, however, get me to stop selling. But my smoking habits didn't change, and now I was going through pot like never before (keeping in mind that it was generally shared between me and four other people or so). I had no money anymore, and the money I had went to pot. There were times when we would spend our food money on pot and just sit around stoned and hungry doing absolutely nothing.

Once the second semester rolled around, I pretty much have up on going to class entirely. I was at the point in my college career where I had to make a decision as to what I wanted to get a degree in, and instead of trying something I just stayed in and got high. Before my semester started, I managed to land myself a boyfriend who also smoked (which was amazing to me at the time), though he was going to school full-time and working full-time. Several times I lied to him that I had been going to class and consistently working, and he was too busy to notice anything different. When he was at work or school, I was at my apartment getting stoned or at my dealer's house getting stoned. When he was free, I went and got stoned with him. This is also the semester I started experimenting with other drugs (mushrooms, MDMA, and LSD mainly at this point). By the end of the semester I dropped all my classes because I just completely stopped attending them. My lease in my apartment was up so instead of moving in with my buddies again, I moved into a house with my boyfriend decently far away from my school. I got a job at a pet store nearby for some rent/drug money and never really made any effort to go back to school.

That summer, my drug use increased. I began going to parties almost every night, some of them really seedy and weird, and getting fucked up in ways I never even dreamed of before. I was introduced to things like cocaine, ketamine, MXE, 25i-NBOMe, and lots of other research chemicals and unpleasant-sounding stuff. I became good friends with a bunch of fire-spinning hippies that traveled to burn events across the country and got sucked into the lifestyle (but more so into the rampant drug use). I picked up fire-spinning (which I still LOVE as a performing art) and gave up pretty much all of my ambition.

By this point I had seen many of my friends taken to jail for drug-related offensive. I have seen my high-volume dealer buddies get set up and sent away for years. While I did most drugs 'recreationally', they defined my lifestyle and my constant smoking increased to at LEAST a quarter to a half ounce a week for purely personal use. Smoking no longer made me feel happy or even comfortable - I found myself again depressed for reasons beyond my understanding, I was anxious anytime I was high, and I was constantly afraid of getting caught. Instead of wanting to get high as a social thing, I now felt the inexplicable NEED to get high. I felt that if I wasn't high, I wasn't experiencing life to its fullest potential. I would even smoke several bowls right before going into work and be extremely uncomfortable, but for some reason I never felt the desire to just not get high.

Most of the people I hang out with now are work friends that like smoking and doing drugs. I have introduced a lot of my co-workers to drugs they might not have tried otherwise. Several people consider me the go-to guy for wanting to experience something like that. Drugs (and not exclusively pot, but definitely more so than any other drug) became my identity somewhere along the line.

Over the past month, I've been promoted to manager at my store and my responsibilities have begun increasing. I no longer am able to go out, get fucked up on who-knows-what, and go into work the next day without a steep decline in my work quality. But the co-workers I am friends with still want me to be that guy for them, and I am finding more and more that I can't. It seems lately that most of my friendships with people are based on this idea, of drugs as my identity, and I feel like I could be better than that.

For the past few days I have had the flu, and I think that is what ultimately convinced me to stop smoking. I smoked bowl after bowl trying to make myself feel better, but it just made me feel exponentially worse. I felt high, but it's not the same as when I first started smoking. It's not exciting or fun, it's something I psychologically feel like I need in order to function properly. Last night I talked to my boyfriend (who I now have been living with for almost a year) about it and he was very understanding. He wants me to be happy and successful, and while he smokes, he's willing to stop as well just out of solidarity. I want to focus on my job and prove to my bosses that I can take things seriously. I want to go back to school and get a degree and actually do something with my life. And I'm not all anti-weed all of the sudden, I just have come to the realization that I am psychologically not ready for it. I think I need to get the rest of my life back on track before I start introducing pot into the mix. So maybe one day, when pot is legal and I have a stable career and the funds available (instead of blowing all my spare cash on drugs), I could take another look at the habit, but for now I can't handle it. And that's okay, I think.

Since I've had this epiphany, my entire outlook on life has changed. I feel optimistic and happy, and I feel like I can conquer anything life throws my way. I feel like I have finally discovered my own potential, and that is something no drug could ever recreate.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_182qo1,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/182qo1/well_i_never_thought_i_would_end_up_here/,

Today I am 60 days smoke free after 13 years of daily puffing any where from 2 to 10 joints. This seemed like an unreachable goal, something I never even fathomed I could attain. I wanted more though, I wanted to see what was beyond the haze of smoke that had surrounded my entire life for as long as I could remember. I wanted to release the guilt trip my mother held over me, that giving it up meant giving up her. But most of all I want to present my husband with healthy baby because he has always supported me either way even though he doesn't smoke. He prides himself on being healthy and he deserves to have a child brought in to the world the same way.

The first week was hell, I had the sweats I was a bitch and hated just about everybody. I tried to justify why it was fine to continue to smoke, but you all talked me off the ledge. I dealt with the feelings towards my Mom and she even told me she was proud of me. It has honestly been the hardest thing I ever did. It got easier day by day and the more my habits changed the farther the memory of weed drifted. I used to smoke every single night and couldn't sleep without it. I had to think about, not thinking about it every night, and now it doesn't even cross my mind. I was so surprised how easily the pattern faded. My life is richer, my confidence is higher then its ever been. I don't sleep much better but not any worse. I feel set free because I'm not leaving every social gathering to run home and smoke.

So I called this the finale, even though I'm only 60 days in because I feel like I've won. But quitting blessed me with something even bigger, I'm pregnant! That thing I was fighting for is growing inside of me, and I want to be the mother I never had. I can't say that I'll never smoke again; one day at a time. But I'm sure it will never have control of me ever again and has no place in my daily life. Thank-you so much because you all helped be achieve that.

I hope it will remind other people how they REALLY felt when high and it will deter them from smoking, too.

Reasons Why I Have to Quit:

It has taken over my life.

It makes me antisocial; a hermit; socially awkward. I don't talk. When I laugh, it's a tired, fake laugh. My brain is not fully there.

I go around in a haze.

It's not like it used to be when I was a teenager. I smoke just to feel ""different"" now. It's not some fun, dangerous thing to do anymore. I am always attracted to dangerous things; ""getting into trouble""; I must grow up and get out of this mindset. I have two young children.

I'm so sluggish. All the time.

It's taking time away from my children. Period. I neglect them in some ways so that I can hide out and smoke a bowl. They are too young right now to know what I'm doing, but the eldest one will catch on VERY soon. Because it makes me sluggish, I often half-ass my days with them. I and they miss out on things we could be doing together because I'm so tired from smoking pot ALL. DAY. LONG. A puff here, a puff there. All day long.

It's taking time away from living. I would have more confidence and desire for life.

It's taking time away from my husband. I want him to have all of me; the REAL me. It hurts him that I smoke so much. It causes him so much stress.

I will deeply, deeply regret how many years I smoked pot later on. 

I can't breathe.

I can't keep escaping. I don't need to run anymore; so stop trying to escape. There's now nothing to escape from, but my brain is stuck on RUN. ESCAPE. GET AWAY FROM THIS MISERY, ANY WAY YOU CAN.
Must learn to get un-stuck.

If I quit, I'll find out how well my antidepressants are actually working.

I hate that I have spent years of my life thinking about it so much.

I hate how much money I have spent on it over the years and how many jackasses I had to deal with in order to get it.

I love pot. It makes me sick that I love it so much. It makes me feel stupid that I love it so much.


I only made it four days before the withdrawals and constant crying led me to give in and buy a bag. I am about to start over. I am about to try again. I need the strength to make it this time. I need to get pot out of my head, my system, my life. ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1b6pvx,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1b6pvx/reasons_why_i_must_quit_a_letter_to_myself/,

I discovered the SR and started smoking again (at 27) before my wedding, just to take the edge off of the stress of preparing for such a monumental event. Now, I'm ready to quit again. 

Why? Because each time I start again I tell myself I will just keep it on hand for occasional use, but as soon as I light up I'm done. I smoke whenever I have the excuse. However, my inability to control myself eventually leads to more harm than good. I won't go into too much detail but basically, I get addicted every time. One day I will be completely fine, then seemingly overnight it all changes and I'm stuck in a cycle of needing to smoke just so I'll be copacetic. 

From past times quitting I know that the physical symptoms of quitting will be rough for me for at least a month, no appetite, nausea, headaches etc., more pronounced at times of day when I would usually smoke. It's embarrassing being ""that guy"" that got addicted to pot when pot culture insists so adamantly that it does not cause addiction. Ugh. 

Despite all that, losing it feels like losing a close friend. It hurts to think that we won't get to be together anymore. This is the first time I'll be quitting where I could still easily get more if I wanted it.

&gt;This subreddit is for practical discussions about how to stop smoking if you've decided to and support in staying stopped from your fellow leaves.

For people who want or need to change their approach to smoking there are many ways to go about it.  Quitting completely, limiting your smoking to certain times or occasions, buying only enough to support you to cut back, etc.

**But this group is for, and only for, people who have made the decision to quit completely and want help doing it.**  

There's lots of benefit to discussion of whether to quit or not, or tolerance breaks, or smoking only on weekends, but this is not the place for it.  By all means start a new subreddit, there's plenty of room for everyone on reddit.

So please, before you post or comment ask yourself whether you are supporting your fellow leaves in their mission to stop.  If your post or comment does not fit that mission it will be modded out, and if you persist you will be banned.

1339787946.0,41,self.leaves,v3viz,Day 73. My story and some thoughts.,justgrowingchesthair,44,3,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/v3viz/day_73_my_story_and_some_thoughts/,"To start this off, thank you all. This board has been extremely uplifting, inspirational, and key in the development of my sobriety and my ability to make it to this day (and the thousands of days more to come after it).

I started smoking weed when I was 19. The movie Lord of War comes to mind, in which Nicolas Cage (Yuri) says of his brother Vitaly’s addiction: “To this day, I don’t know what Vitaly was running away from. Maybe just from Vitaly.” Here I am 7 years later and thousands of dollars poorer thinking of “why?” and asking the same types of questions. What the hell was I running from?

It started off as “just for fun”. Cannabis certainly made everything better, more enhanced, uplifting, happy, care-free, and just plain enjoyable. I still remember the first time I ever got high. It was 2005 and the movie “Jarhead” was in theaters. My best friend at the time, Ian, came and picked me up and said he had a surprise for me that day. We went to a park in a suburb just outside of Seattle and we smoked a swisher blunt between the two of us. I remember being so stoned I couldn’t even use the water fountain correctly, shooting water all over myself instead of opening my mouth to take a drink. So it came to pass that we went to the theater and watched the movie, high and giggly as hell. Little did I know that the last line of the movie would be the storyline of my addiction for the next 7 years. “And we are still in the desert”. 

Right around this same time my depression really began to ramp up. Not because of smoking weed, mind you. I am almost certain I was depressed long before I ever took that first hit. I had been self-injuring to deal with my stress off and on since I was 18. Slicing up my arms with a razorblade seemed much more preferable to me than wallowing in my own sadness, unable to find a reasonable outlet for my emotions. I became addicted to that, and it would spell out how I would deal with my emotions for nearly the next decade. Anything that could numb the pain, I became attached to. 

So when I found the magical properties of weed, the way it calmed me down, made me forget, and allowed me to slip into a nice, hazy wonderland I was thoroughly relieved. I found something that was socially acceptable, personally acceptable, and I didn’t have to endure any pain or sadness while using it. It was literally the perfect solution to all of my problems. 

That perfect solution soon became an addiction. I went from smoking weed once a month, to once every few weeks, to every weekend, to everyday. I think we are all familiar with this cycle. I started it and once it was started, I certainly didn’t want to stop. For the next 7 years, I spent thousands of dollars, hours, all of my effort, and gave up a lot of my passions to simply pursue getting high. I was able to always maintain a job, keep up with bills, and in general be a functional stoner type. I rationalized my addiction with everything there was. “It’s just a plant”, “it’s not physically addictive”, “weed actually promotes brain cell growth”, “the first law in the US regarding weed was requiring farmers to grow it”, “the monkey study in the Reagan era was totally rigged”. You named it, I had a rationalization for why it was okay for me to keep smoking massive amounts of weed while spending un-godly amounts of money on it. 

Somewhere along the way (in one of the rarer moments where I wasn’t stoned) I was able to take tolerance breaks here and there. But I always came back. My depression lifted (for the most part) and departed my life as mysteriously as it had appeared. However, the habit remained. 

It wasn’t until this year that I finally realized the terrible way in which I was abusing marijuana. For some people, they can smoke once a year or even once a month, and that measured use is fine for them. I tried so many times to “just cut back”. I smashed so many pieces in acts of defiance, saying “this is the last time I smoke”. It wasn’t until I got a job in a country where all drugs are illegal that I had to take a serious look at my addiction and what I had become. I stepped onto the plane and consumed two weed brownies on April 03, 2012. That was the last time any THC entered my body.

When I stepped off that plane, I was arrogantly thinking that this would just be a temporary tolerance break. The first two weeks were the hardest. I hardly slept at all, and anything that I put in my mouth just tasted like gravel. My emotions were a wreck, I was up and down and for brief periods of a few days, my depression came back in full force. But I dealt with it because I had no choice. Slowly, one week became two. Two became four. And four became six. I started dreaming again. They were extremely vivid, lifelike, and lucid. All that time being high had changed my brain so that I didn’t dream. I started writing my dreams down, many of them having symbolic references. 
Then I started to think about “why”? Why did I smoke weed? Why did I want to get high all the time? What happened to all the hobbies I had when I was 19 that simply don’t exist now because of my smoking constantly? Why is my first instinct when doing something to say to myself “this would be so much better if I were fucked up?” I started to examine why I smoked to begin with. And I made the decision with my head to follow the decision of my body and not smoke weed and stay sober. And every day has gotten so much better. 

I swore off cigarettes (after smoking them for as long as I’d smoked weed) on April 14. Today marks 73 days off of weed and 62 days cigarette free. I can breathe again. I can smell and taste food again. I started running. I started reading like a fiend, devouring books like they were sacks of the sweetest kush. I started writing, collecting music, actually listening to music, and started doing small graphic design projects. When I started running, it took me 1 hour, 8 minutes to run 4 miles. It now takes me 43 minutes to run that same distance and I don’t plan on stopping. My wit is back and is quicker than ever. My thoughts come to me swiftly and without hesitation. My vocabulary has expanded from just “duuuuude…..” to so much more than that. I feel like I have my life back. I’m motivated to live this life. 

I’m more motivated now than I have been in the last 7 years and it feels good. Quotes from Albert Camus like, “In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer” sit in the back of my mind. Ayn Rand saying do not “let the hero in your soul perish”. An encouraging Redditor on this sub-reddit exclaiming, “I realised something though, I wasn't living. I was allowing myself to slowly trudge through life, not chasing anything I wanted, just being okay with being. I was destroying myself by wasting my most precious resource; time.” Another Redditor states that they want to live in the “real world of people who choose life instead of a daily habit that clouds their perception.” 

All these words and much more have been encouraging and I want to pass on what I’ve learned to others. Weed is a drug. It will alter your mind just like any other substance. Maybe not in a markedly detrimental way like hard drugs, but it still changes you. There are those who can hit a joint at a concert once a year and be content. I’m not one of those people. But I’m slowly and surely becoming okay with the idea of living my life for today. Being in the moment and moving forward to bigger, better things. I don’t need substances to help me live my life, have fun, elevate my mood, or otherwise change me. I am becoming comfortable with who I am and who I want to be.

Keep moving forward.

I'm on day 24 letting go of a 13 year mentally, physically and socially ingrained habit. The hardest part is finding I'll have to let go of my mom because all she does is smoke and it has been one of the reason I continually justify it. Besides being a high functioning pot head. 

But something happened this weekend, something I never saw coming we went to a movie and she asked ""So are you still not smoking?"" in her slightly demeaning voice, ""nope, 3 weeks smoke-free"" and then I think pigs flew, because she said ""good, I'm proud of you"" Never in my life had I dreamed she ever say those words in that context! never. ever, ever.

I never saw myself coming this far or making such an enormous change. Thank-you so much to all you reddits' who have and continue to be my support. Your words and advice have meant the world to me.

Up to that point I had barely even drank alcohol, let alone do anything society considers to be a narcotic. I am turning 30 next month.

One night when the girlfriend was out of town on business and I was hanging out with friends, I asked if I could try it. I was bummed about not getting a job with the FBI and thought that getting high might be the ticket to make me not bummed out. And that's when I had the realization that weed was the single greatest thing in the world. After that night, it was all I wanted to do. Weed almost ruined my life.

It started sorta slow. I bought a quarter ounce (over the internet, of all places) and slowly smoked it over the course of three months. I made rules about not doing it before work and not doing it if I had a pre-existing obligations. Slowly, too, those rules were all broken and nullified. I was consistently high all the time.

Throughout my burgeoning love affair with weed, my girlfriend was set aside in my life. After about eight months of my new hobby, we had a serious talk. She was absolutely ready to leave me if I didn't stop this behavior. I told her every rationalization I could think of for why it shouldn't be a big deal for me to smoke weed whenever I want.

*""It makes me more creative.""*

*""I like the way I am able to think while high.""*

*""It's not affecting my ability to function as an adult. I still have a job.""*

Then I lost my job. I was caught smoking weed at the university where I worked.

I lied to her about why I lost my job because I was utterly convinced that she would leave me if she knew why. I ended up taking a job delivering furniture because it was all I could find. I continually smoked weed while doing this job as a way to cope with the fact that I, a college graduate, was reduced to delivering furniture. I felt like a complete failure. It was also during this time that I decided to only smoke weed ""in secret"" and never let her see that I was doing it.

I finally got out of that rut and was able to secure a better job but the smoking didn't stop. I was living bag-to-bag and would get extremely anxious as I ran out of weed. Being without weed was not an option.

In 2011, my girlfriend and I got married after dating for almost 10 years. I smoked weed on the day we had our engagement photos taken and ruined them because I look toasted in every photo. I even smoked weed on the morning of our wedding after going for a run.

*""Going for a run!""*

That was what ultimately became a codified phrase meaning *""Going to smoke weed!""* I knew it and she knew it. It was an open secret. I wasn't lying because I truly did go running, but it was always preceded by me smoking weed out of a homemade gravity bong (which had become my preferred method of smoking over the past few years). I would get high and just run until I couldn't feel anything.

What I didn't realize is that the entire time I was perma-high, my wife had been coping in her own ways. She had started to put on weight and stopped doing yoga. Instead, she would binge eat while I would spend hours outside running or riding my bike while completely baked. It didn't even matter if it was pouring rain and 45 degrees outside: I would have rather been outside, stoned and running than to try to be sober at home.

A month ago I had enough of it. I got tired of smoking to feel normal. It disgusted me that I was being continually dishonest to my wife. I had the sneaking suspicion that I was acutely depressed and using weed to mask it. I decided to quit but I knew I couldn't do it alone after previous attempts ended in utter failure.

I was supposed to go out that evening and sing karaoke with some friends. I left early so I could smoke before I showed up and as I was driving I thought to myself *""I cannot do this anymore. I simply can't do it.""*

So I turned the car around and drove home. I parked the car and she heard the *BEEP!* that comes with arming the car security system and met me at the door with a confused look on her face.

With tears in my eyes and a bag of weed in my hand I said to her:

*""I need help. I can't do this by myself. Will you please flush this down the toilet?""*

I cried, she cried. I said I was sorry for everything and that I would change. There have been missteps and relapses since then, but all around it *is* getting better. I'm seeing a therapist to deal with the waves of emotions that are surfacing in my now-sober brain and my wife is being 100% supportive.

I can live without weed. I can't live without my wife.

**TL;DR:** I've been habitually smoking weed for the last 7 years of my life and even though quitting has taken a huge toll on my mental state, it has ultimately been worth it.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1e197y,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1e197y/if_i_can_quit_you_can_quit/,

This is a lot to get off my shoulders so I'll have you know now that it'll be a long read. I'm writing this mostly for myself, to organize my thoughts and strengthen my resolve by being accountable to this post. But if you're trying to quit... if you're thinking about quitting, you will find something, I promise.

I am now 24 years old. I have a decent office job, a place in the big city, and a girlfriend whom I cherish. I live close to my best friends and the things I love to do. 

And yet, I am crushingly unhappy. 

I've been smoking weed since I was 17. It all started one summer in high school in an old drainage ditch. It was still fun and games, until I decided to transfer sophomore year of college to a school across the nation in the northeast (I'm from southern california). There, I couldn't handle the long, frozen winters and totally new social environment and became very stressed. I remember the first night I justified smoking for that reason; I was stressing over the fact that I came to a very expensive private school and wasn't making full use of it. I was throwing my dad's hard earned money away, and the guilt was ravaging me. I should have taken that anger, that energy, and turned it into something positive. Instead, I chose to smother it. 

And so it began, the dream. I started smoking every night in the dorms with a friend that sophomore year to pass the dark and cold winter. Spring came and I didn't stop. In the fall before, before I had started smoking heavily, I'd been pretty social, going to a good amount of parties and trysting with a few ladies. Well, that never happened more than once a semester from that point forward.

For the rest of college I lived that dream. While the rest of my classmates started growing up, scoring internships and getting all that party out of their system, I just chugged by at a dismal pace scoring B minuses and barely graduating. In retrospect, I totally wasted my college years. I was at a prestigious private school and all I could do was balk at the lack of ""chill"" weed smokers, and became a shut-in. I continued to smother my problems and issues in pot, right up until the day I graduated.

Somehow I still got a decent job. It's not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life but it pays pretty well and it's fairly interesting (internet marketing analytics). I came back to socal and established my life here, got back with my old girl. That first year back, I also got a medical card.

Things quickly went from bad to worse. I used that salary to fund a true smoking problem, buying my own scientific glass and top-shelf buds. I probably don't need to tell you that I performed poorly at my job. I would go in late stoned, smoke in my car during lunch, and socialize with nobody for weeks at a time. I was brought on under the pretense that I was entrepreneurial, independent and opportunity seeking; when the company realized that wasn't happening, I was laid off.

Now, this is the first time I found r/leaves and got the idea that things need to change big time. That was the year I also discovered reddit and trees in my 9 hours of doing nothing at work daily. When I got the job news I didn't smoke for one night and tried to shape up. I almost got there to sustained abstinence, but then something else happened: I got another job doing the same shit at a different company. So my sense of security came back, and as sure as can be I fell back into the old routines. 

Holy shit this is getting long, I'm sorry guys if you actually read up till here. It'll come to a head very soon.

Yesterday, it finally happened. My girlfriend and I have been fighting for a while now. It all blew up in my face as she told it to me straight. That she was sick and tired of my inability to regulate. That she thought it was pathetic that I couldn't go a night without a puff. That she had been losing attraction to me for some time as a result of my moody stoner behavior. 

Now this girl isn't a straight edge by a longshot. She was a sorority girl at uc berkeley and did quite the many drugs. For the first year of me being back, she was content to spend our weekends stoned, watching shows, eating and sleeping together. The problem is that, that didn't change. Even as she dropped hints of growing up, changing things, maybe going on a romantic trip together, I was content to just stay put like weed smokers so often are. While I bought her meals, presents, etc., I never really went out of my way to do anything except smoke and sleep together on weekends

But yesterday, as I fought with her for the countless time because of my post-work weed-craving irritable state, she told me she was tired of it all. That I simply was not worth it to her and she is thinking about just taking a break for a while. Now, I'm no fool when it comes to relationships and I know exactly what that means. Guys, I've been slapped in the face. It was here and then I realized that unless I stop now, the problems will only get worse.

I'm tired of it all guys. I'm tired of having my mood so dependent on this external thing, this plant. I'm tired of having to plan my day around getting high, of having to worry about when my next pickup is or if I have a little nug on me. I'm tired of not being able to connect with people and viewing them through a constant foggy glass. 

I'm tired of having my potential and future screwed because I can't cope with a little stress. I'm tired of constantly being blunt and apathetic, and people seeing that as who I am. I'm tired of having no motivation and falling behind my friends.

I truly feel like I have forgotten who I am at this point. My identity and personality is so fused with being high that they are one at the same. I don't know who I am, what I want or where I'm going. That needs to change.

TLDR; Been smoking for 7 years now through college, almost lost my job last year, am in the process of losing my girlfriend, realized I need to quit to get my life back in shape. 

Tonight, I have some melatonin and xanax. I know it's not good to replace one drug with another but I have a feeling that tonight will be the worst. Thanks for reading guys and good luck with your battles.

My unable to get nug bliss ended shortly, it didn't take long for the old guy to send me multiple phone #'s for people that took over the business in town.

The sweating has mostly stopped, only occasionally with the heavy dream sweat.  Dreams are mostly pleasant as long as I am comfortable in my bed.

Last weekend around day 14 and 15 I had nausea that made it extremely difficult.  There was a point where I felt like shit and I knew one good inhale from the vape would fix my nausea and restore my appetite.  I had to let it take it's course the natural way, which was extremely annoying.

I have a few good things to report.  Mostly the cravings have gone down.  I had an issue during a snow day when I stayed home from work, a time when I would have been extremely high previously.  

I was able to buy a game for xbox that I would normally blaze through, and I was able to enjoy it without wanting to get high, which is a big deal.  

I was able to have a couple drinks this weekend without any major cravings to get high.

I have been quit for 34 days now and feel great. /r/leaves has been a really nice extra support to stay quit. The stories from others who are further along than I am have been very encouraging, and it's been nice to give back by leaving comments that are supportive of others.

To describe my experience a little so far ... I'd been smoking daily for over 10 years, even before work. I quit cold turkey 34 days ago, in the middle of a high anxiety period of my life. I experienced noticeable withdrawal symptoms for about a week, which included sleeplessness, irritability, no appetite, trouble controlling my body temperature, and boredom. Those all passed; I started eating better and sleeping better, and finding new ways to spend my time. When I was smoking, I would have told you I was plenty busy and hadn't neglected my hobbies, but after I quit I did notice how much time I had put into smoking and watching television. I feel great now; definitely mentally sharper and more aware and even wittier. The hardest part for me has been learning new tools to manage stress and anxiety. I'm developing a daily meditation practice, I have support from my friends and partner, I post here on /r/leaves, and after the vacation I'm currently on, I hope to dive into a daily exercise routine. I hear it keeps getting better -- mind even sharper, better memory -- the more time goes from when I last smoked.

Not to mention I'm only 2 semesters away from graduating, but I just don't care about my studies. In my head I feel like a complete piece of shit, but I can't seem to do anything about it. It doesn't help that my roommate smokes twice a day too.

But I'm ready to take the leap. I've come across C25K (see [r/c25k](http://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/) for info) and I think doing this will help me keep my mind off of it. I used to love running but I haven't done it in so long. I'm excited to get that rush back.

finally, i made a decision to leave my boyfriend for other important reasons, and that meant moving back in with my parents. i think i was lucky because the location change and the routine change made it a little easier on me. i also have too much respect for my parents to betray them by smoking under their roof. they are aware that weed ruined my life, and they accepted me back home and are helping me reach my goals.

I am a 20 year old student who quit for new years. I got to a point in the latter part of 2012 where I smoked every day, and decided that it wasn't for me. I felt that I was no longer participating in life, my phone was constantly ringing off the hook from 'friends' who wanted to come 'chill' (I was very generous and had a lot of nice pieces) and although I could always see through peoples selfish bullshit I was so content from smoking that I watched my own life get sucked into a never ending bong rip and I could see no end.

New years eve I was smoking as usual, rip after rip with friends who were in town. The clock struck midnight and of course I was smoking. I continued to smoke all night and all morning and when I got back to my apartment, I told myself that I was done with this lifestyle. There was no fun in it anymore. I felt like a slave to a plant and I got pissed. This anger was the first time I felt a real surge of emotion in months.

There have been a lot of benefits to quitting. I go to class more often. I talk to professors. I make friends from class and not from parties. I am more direct in my interactions with people about how I am feeling rather than just shrugging about everything with a default response of 'oh well.' I have clarity. I am more in control of my life. 

The negatives are that the personality flaws and problems that I covered up by smoking have come back and are not easy to deal with. I am so short-tempered I pretty much full-on yell at someone every 2 or 3 days about various things. I'm depressed. I feel alone a lot of the time. 

About 90% of my friends last year were stoners. It's been really shitty having to tell the exact story to different people and always getting the same response. ""Come on man, weed is not that bad!"" 

It's become truly grotesque to me the way that some people use weed. People just use it to numb themselves. To give themselves an excuse. ""My bad, I was high."" This is analogous to the girls that hook up with douchebags every weekend and just say ""Oh I was drunk."" But if you drink every thursday/friday/saturday then what you're really saying is: I use alcohol to cover up for the fact that I do stupid things that I can't do sober. If you get back an F in a class and say 'Oh I was high' - it's kind of the same thing. You pretend to enjoy it but it's just a numbing agent so that when your life spirals out of control you don't feel so bad about it.

I don't mean to make this about anyone else. This is about me. Not using drugs is a personal decision that you should make for yourself, and not anyone else. In my time from transitioning from intense pot smoker with all the cool bongs - to the guy who just drinks sometimes, i've noticed so many holes in weed logic and faced so many issues head on because of going cold turkey. 

On a positive note - many people didn't think I could make it this far. People would scoff at my calender (I mark off days I havent smoked with a highlighter) and they say - one week? Psssh. 

Well, i'll tell you guys something, once you make it about a month, peoples thoughts change. They really start looking at themselves because the person who they thought would never quit....did. And what they perceived as a tolerance break is now changing into a lifestyle change. Your former stoner friends who have at least a drop of introspective qualities about themselves will start to wonder why you swore off bud and haven't come back. They will try to quit too or cut back. And eventually (this is almost a guarantee) they will start coming to you and asking you how you did it. I'm pretty bitter about helping people who didn't believe in me but I always give them advice. but it gets really old talking to someone for hours just to see them running around getting stoned again the next day. 

Ah, i'm sorry. I sound like a mean old man but sometimes I can't help it. I get so angry these days. Angry isn't the right word...just...disappointed that weed culture has morphed into a giant circlejerk that thinks they can do no harm. 

I'm just going to stop but maybe some of you are at the same point in your lives and can relate or something. 

Thanks for reading.

My sadness comes in remembering how I used to love weed and how I want to feel good on it like I used to.

I see a ton of new people on here, so here's my [quitting post](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/veoqb/feeding_shadows/) if you want to read it, just to see where I came from.

I didn't want to do the 'Day 5..6...7' day sober posts because it's hard to find a good spot to see things from when emotionally you are being tossed around in the middle of a hurricane.  Self awareness and introspection are awesome but they do need a stable point to look from. So here's my 'almost a month anniversary' post. I know, another way too wordy wall of text, yay. I also know that I annoy a lot of people here, so this is probably going to be the last of my own threads. So........here it goes.

I read on TIL onetime that you forget things when you walk through doorways because your brain sees the boundary and basically cuts your line of thinking off and creates a new chapter. I'm that way now. I know what I was doing before 3 weeks to a month ago. That's easy. But there's a wall there when I try to look back at the mindset I had back then.  It's weird using 'back then' too, to talk about something that was around the last time I paid rent. That's the big thing about weed though, it changes you.  Slowly, bit by bit, until the things that you used to love before aren't such a bit part of your life anymore. Looking in the mirror a month ago and seeing someone you never wanted to become is an eye opener.

I'm picking up the guitars that my dad gave me a couple years ago that have been collecting dust. The one's I promised to play everyday when he handed them over because they weren't cheap.  My life is full of things like this actually. Little things that used to mean a ton to me but fell away when they only thing that mattered was coming home and getting numb. Only I'm not numb anymore. Each little thing is like a present from the past me welcoming me back to the land of the living. Dance shoes? Hey I remember those! Time to turn on the stereo and try again. Finding the old Kenza Farah CD I had to special order? Awesome. I wonder what other music I've been missing out on.

I'd love everyone to do this. The worst part about cutting out a huge part of your life isn't withdrawals or panic attacks. It's boredom. It's the 'wtf and I'm supposed to do now?'. It's the part that no one ever talks about, like you magically get better right after you throw away your stash. I didn't stop smoking weed, I started trying to heal the reasons and scars underneath that let me start smoking like that in the first place. Walk out of your apt/dorm/house and reconnect with life. Talk to random people. Fuck someone. Twice maybe. Watch a sunset. Sitting in your normal smoking spot, just not smoking, is going to do more harm than good long term.

So life has been going so awesome. I'm a runner. So like a week ago I was feeling particularly awesome and decided to sprint up a really steep, really tall hill. I was doing great until the little thing in my knee that I messed up Ice Skating when I was 16 decided it needed a vacation, and I limped/crawled home. No worries, injuries happen. Anybody that moves enough is going to get them eventually. My doctor gave me some Tylenol 3 with Codeine and told me to stay off my knee. I couldn't wait to get back out there training, I want to run a 5k soon and WIN.

I caught myself doubling the dose on the pills last night, even though it only hurt a little bit. My exact thoughts were 'This is going to feel awesome'. I ran to the bathroom and threw the pills up before throwing the rest of the bottle into the trash. Never forget the shadows that we try not to feed are still there, no matter how sunny things might look on the outside. Freedom isn't free, and I'm not going to sacrifice the life that was waiting for me to wake up for a quick buzz. I know why my dad still goes to AA now, even after all these years. Addict is a harsh word, but it's a reminder that things can just as easily go the other way if you aren't careful.

While today is technically Day 2 of my sobriety I stopped smoking at 1pm 48 hours ago.

I feel much more energized but I also am having a great deal of problems sleeping.

My appetite has taken a hit and I have been very nauseous. 

I still want to smoke bad. I still want to get high. I know that I have to stay strong and continue my pursuit of sobriety.

Yesterday I turned down smoking bud with some friends at a BBQ but I know if I am around my dealer (who is a very close friend) or other friends I will revert back to my old habits. I have chose to ignore these people until the first few weeks of sobriety have passed.

The hardest thing is to get over the habit of doing everything HIGH. I couldn't do even the simplest activity without smoking a bowl or a fat j. From listening to music, watching a tv show, browsing the web, I needed to get high. It is hard to break that habit of always needing to be high. I am very bored and have tried reading, playing video games, hanging out with my sober friends, and exercising. I know its only day 2 but I will continue to update as much as I can.

I want to thank all the people that responded to my last post with helpful advice. This Leaves community is an answer to my prayers for a community of like minded individuals who are going thru the same problems I am. Thanks for providing me with an outlet to discuss my troubles with you guys.

1310069149.0,37,self.leaves,ijcfs,"From romantic involvement to distant friendship, a metaphor of my cannabis use",,45,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ijcfs/from_romantic_involvement_to_distant_friendship_a/,"My cannabis experience parallels that of so many here. In short, I left adolescence with more than one emotional issue and a fragmented identity. Depression and anxiety were never debilitating enough for me to seek treatment, but both were a persistent specter looming over my daily life.

I picked up smoking gradually. It was, to me, remarkable how profoundly I was affected by the drug. I experienced euphoria, intense closed-eye visuals, heightened sense of space and time, and sometimes incredible creativity. Each time I blazed I had a temporary reprieve from the mundane reality of my life.

Slowly I began to smoke more frequently. At first I recognized the problem with smoking more than once or twice a week: I never returned to a clear-headed state. I began living in a perpetual state of brain fog, mild but present enough to hinder some of my cognitive processes.

Eventually things began to turn darker; my highs would spur thought trips, deeply introspective journeys through my mind, memories, and imagination. Some were incredible and generated ideas I would not normally be capable of. Others were negative, exposing perspectives of myself and others that were uncomfortable and painful.

Smoking was now exacerbating my anxiety. While high, being anywhere else but alone or with close friends was an intense experience. This anxiety boiled over into my non-high state of mind. I was having difficulty looking people in the eye, talking fluently, and performing general tasks that required social interaction.

The anxiety progressed into depression, and I fell into a rut. Escapism has always been my antidote to reality and following that, my cannabis use increased to become a daily ritual. I would take forced tolerance breaks of a week or two at a time because I felt it was necessary for my health, but in hindsight it was more about trying to return to that intense, spirit-lifting first high feeling.

The days blurred into weeks and my emotional problems persisted without my attendance. I was detached, distant from my emotions and vacant of personality. I was an observer to my life, not a participant. It took great effort to convince myself of the reality of my situation: cannabis was not helping me out of my rut, it was digging it deeper.

Quitting was easy. And it was easier the second time, and the third time. I would subconsciously form a reservation to use such that there was no emotional pain resulting from taking a cold-turkey tolerance break. Every time I was convinced this would be my last time, and every time subsequent the same attitude appeared. My impaired memory prevented me from feeling guilty about my habitual continuation of use.

Through great effort I realized it was important for me to quit. I knew it would not be enough to go cold turkey and write off my past use as a mistake. To me this felt like running away from a relationship gone sour. Surely I would run back when things got tough.

I began retracing my steps. Multiple joints per day (joint being a normalized unit of cannabis) down to one at night. Once again I began taking more frequent tolerance breaks. I threw away my smoking equipment, went back to how I started: scissors, a shot glass, and some rolling papers. There were relapses where I fell into heavy use patterns again.

At first those relapses caused guilt. That guilt led to a worsening of my emotional condition, and inevitably made it far more challenging to muster the strength to quit. After admitting to myself that what I was trying to do would take persistence, it became easier to take tolerance breaks, to cut down my use, and to properly deal with the feelings of guilt.

I expended a great amount of energy trying to understand the nature of my addiction. The most useful mental tool I discovered was considering my cannabis addiction like a relationship with a partner. Fun at times, destructive at others. Eventually the negatives outweighed the positives, and the urge to leave that relationship grew. I will extend this metaphor a bit.

In my own immature way, I left that relationship by walking away, convincing myself I was now above it. And when I fell on harder times, the comfort of that relationship drew me back. Cannabis is a forgiving mistress: she will always take you back with warm and caring arms.

For me, the only lasting separation would be an amicable one. I would need to be able to smoke again in the future, once or twice, and not feel the current of addiction erode my emotional composure and resolve. To do this required careful analysis of my reaction to boredom and stress. 

The first step was resolving the boredom-induced drive to smoke. I found this was as simple as reminding myself every time I felt like smoking that I was reverting to my default behavior, like a subroutine in a program that gets called when the system goes idle. I reminded myself of the equivalence of most activities in staving off boredom, and slowly replaced smoking with other things.

The difficult part was resolving the stress-related cause of my cannabis use. Quitting for me has three curves, each steeper than the one before. First: habit; second: boredom; third: escapism. The one week mark of my tolerance breaks were usually the breaking point. It was at one week when most of the fog had lifted and the uncomfortable realities of life came back. It was all too easy to jump back into my little plastic bag of comfort anytime my emotions became tumultuous. 

Most of the time I felt like I did not have the strength to quit. When I started viewing strength not as a binary ability but as a trend of overcoming obstacles, it became vastly easier to have the confidence to ride out those initial hurdles of quitting.

When I viewed quitting as a fight against my own desires, I lost that battle every time. When I viewed it as fulfillment of my overarching desire to quit, I started succeeding. It's not about cutting myself off from the drug and walking away. It's about reasoning with myself and carrying a momentum, stubbornly or in an inspired fashion, through the challenges of leaving a previously wondrous relationship.

In the last bag I smoked I left some remaining to flush down the toilet. It's a symbolic act, one I had carried out many times before. It was always easy because I was safe in the comfort of knowing I could always get more. The last time I flushed the bag, it was immensely challenging. I sat there for five minutes and reflected on the history of my use and some of the challenges that lay before me.

It was nearly as painful as breaking up with a long-term partner. I knew that source of comfort was leaving my life. But I also realized after many failed attempts that I could not leave a negative emotional imprint on myself by demonizing that partner. She is still just as attractive, warm, caring, and lovely as ever before. I had to accept this and realize it was me that was incapable of sustaining a healthy relationship.

And I want to revisit this partner sometime in the future. I want to catch up, have some drinks, share a few laughs, and reflect on old times. But I won't be handling the cheque, taking her to bed, or moving in. She will be an old friend, and nothing more.


I hope in writing this that I have provided an alternative perspective through metaphor. If you are quitting, remember that if you walk away altogether, you may not resolve that emotional longing to again smoke and feel as you once did. If you frame it mentally as transforming a failing romantic relationship into a distant friendship, it may be easier to make lasting changes in your life and to take the reins to your future back from cannabis.

I feel WEIIIIRD. Most of the day yesterday, I felt like it was ""good weird"". I found that my head is clearer, and I feel like I'm manifesting more positive personality aspects. I have a lot of anxiety issues, and so I tend to take everything everyone says too seriously and I kind of act like a whipped dog for no reason, or at least that's how I feel. Yesterday, my voice sounded deeper, I felt more confident, I just kind of kicked ass at work.

Then, came the evening. I always toke at night because I get depressed in the evening, and to help me sleep. For the first time in a pretty long time I was forced to confront myself, there was no running. I just kind of lay in bed and stared at the ceiling. I don't really know how to describe it I just feel different. I feel like I woke up in someone else's body. It scares me a little bit. I feel like there's this feeling of impending doom poking at the back of my skull. I feel like a mole who has sworn off the ground and has forced himself into sunlight.

I asked my girlfriend to call me because I figured it might cheer me up a bit. I wasn't feeling the usual deep sadness and desperation I normally feel, it was more like, I dunno, mild confusion and perplexity? I asked her if I seemed anywhere near as weird as I feel and she got kind of upset and said she can't remember specific details about things that happened five minutes ago let alone earlier that night. Not sure what her deal is. I told her if nothing stuck out in her mind that's probably a good thing.

I guess the best way to describe how i'm feeling currently is I feel like I'm in a strange dream. ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1fpzbv,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1fpzbv/who_the_hell_am_i/,
1367084819.0,40,self.leaves,1d84rl,Tips to quitting,nhalwa,45,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1d84rl/tips_to_quitting/,"I'm 28 yr male, been smoking for 16 years, every day for about 12 years...so more than half my life I have been a smoker. At the height of my addiction I have smoked a 1/2 oz every 4 days. I am very happy this sub was created. I've quit several times in my life for different periods of time, and for different motivational reasons. Here is a list of things I found most successful:

1. Find things to do with your time - this doesn't mean quit and then find things to do it means just start doing stuff. One of the reasons pot was so great is it made me OK with doing nothing at all. This could be anything from reading, to writing to going to the gym. The busier you keep yourself, the less you think about smoking and the less you need it to fill in that void time

2. Get some exercise - we've all heard this before, exercise releases endorphins which mimics the effects of the weed. Walking or biking is great for people that might not be very active. Running, or hard cardio especially is fantastic for replacing those feelings of being high. Sports, weights, dance anything where your moving a lot is going to help your cravings. I personally discovered Hot Yoga which is great for mind and body.

3. Surround yourself with people who don't smoke - this is a really tough one. Usually your friend base is people who smoke but more often than that you have nothing else in common with them except smoking. It can be tough to maintain these relationships - they usually don't want to do anything other than smoke, so most other activities you may find enjoyable are out. Also your conversations all seem to center around smoking which puts the idea into your head and gets you thinking about. Seeing friends and others high also desensitizes you to thinking it's bad.  If you work hard at recovery and start doing things to replace your habit new friendships will form automatically form. You will also notice you are not as withdrawn and more outgoing to talking to people since you're not baked and paranoid.

4. Set small goals for yourself - quitting for ""ever"" can be a daunting task, try to break it up into smaller chunks and reward yourself for achieving those goals. If you are a daily smoker try to aim for one day of not smoking, then two days ect. If you do it on weekends go for the whole weekend without smoking and then move onto two weekends. Eventually you'll get through longer periods and be proud of yourself for your hard work. Rewards should be something you normally wouldn't do, and should be equivalent to the money you've saved from not smoking. (Take yourself for dinner, buy a new computer, expensive article of clothing) this will also reaffirm the money you have spent can be used on much better, more useful things.

5. Drink tons of water - the first few days after heavy smoking you will sweat, and be irratiable, I used to change my shirt 3 times a day after a cold turkey quit. It is very important to drink as much water as possible. It helps cleanse your body, regulates your body chemistry and overall helps you with cravings and not feeling as sh*tty as you might drinking pop or other sugar laced beverages.

6. Find something you love to do - for most of use pot has been our ""thing"" we haven't had to take up any other activities because we're ok with sitting around smoking and sitting around some more. The biggest thing for me when I quit was finding something that you absolutely LOVE, this is difficulty so I listed it last, the weed discussion is a two sided chicken and egg theory, were potential pot heads lazy before they smoked and the pot helped them achieve that lifestyle without guilt or did the pot turn them into amotivational monsters? In either case many of use haven't had a chance to discover those past times like our peers, the guy you went to HS with that still plays basketball twice a week, or the painter than comes home and drowns their stress in their mediums. Everyone has their ""thing"" they do, you need to find yours since its no longer pot. It can be literally ANYTHING - start small and keep trying things, try cooking, hiking, get a pet, try as many of those ""Free Session"" classes as you can that most places offer, start drawing, join clubs, sign up for a sport, go swimming,  just keep doing stuff with your time and eventually you'll find something that makes you feel so great! Take that activity and put all your smoking effort into that one thing, do it like your life depended on it!

The last week has been... trying. I thought the first few days of not smoking would be the hardest, and that it would only get easier. I was wrong. 

Once I got over that initial hurdle, I found myself a little lost as to what my next step was. Through some wonderful people that reached out to me from this subreddit, and some people in my personal life, I've been moving forward again. 

I started my old hobbies up again, which I've found deeply satisfying. I started woodworking again. I went for a bike ride for the first time in probably 3 years. I've began exercising daily, which feels fantastic... In high school, I was a full time athlete. Weed killed that, and made me a couch potato... But no more.

I was once an active member of a community outreach program for youth, and for 3 years I worked with children 3 nights a week, which I absolutely loved. I quit because I decided that I couldn't be a role model anymore, if I was smoking everyday. I went back, yesterday, and inquired about more volunteering, and I think I will be re-accepted. 

Yes, I think about smoking all the time, and yes I have strong urges to smoke almost constantly. The hardest part is realizing how much time you actually spent on it- scoring a bag, breaking it up, the hours spent just getting high and vegging out... And the bitter realization that you don't really know how to fill that time anymore. So I have begun to just commit myself to doing almost anything. 

There is a post right now about how to deal with the boredom. Well, my friends, the world is a very large and exciting place. I struggle with the boredom, but I just throw myself into something to curb that feeling. 

Seriously, just DO something, anything. At one point, I felt I was going to go crazy without some smoke, so I just started jumping around, getting my heart pumping, I started dancing for no reason, then I ran over to a rafter on the ceiling and started doing some pull-ups. Did it stop my craving? Not really. Did it distract me in a positive manner, and help me ""keep my cool?"" Very much so.

I'm sorry for the length of this post, I just wanted to share my experience with my first week of non-smoke.

In the interest of honesty and full disclosure, I did in fact relapse on tuesday evening, by way of a single puff from a pipe. The sense of guilt and shame was almost overwhelming. I felt like a failure, like scum. But I'm not a failure, I'm not scum. I'm just human, and humans make mistakes. A relapse can be a serious thing, but it's not the end of your recovery, only a snag in the long road to a healthy lifestyle. 

I'm not ashamed of my relapse anymore, because it merely strengthened my resolve. I will be strong.

Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to all the wonderful members of this community, and a special shout-out to the person who PMed me, you helped me more than you might realize.

Without this support, I could never have accomplished this much  &lt;3

PMs welcome, if anyone would like to chat in private.

Please be respectful of the fact that if it's not useful to you it may still be to someone else, and we're all working together towards the same personal goals, here.

---------------------------------------------------

My road away from smoking weed goes something like this: I started when I was 15, so up until the point where I quit there was a pretty unbroken chain of ten years during which I smoked. Though I would quit every once in a while for periods usually not longer than a month, from 2002 on I would say I was pretty regularly getting stoned every day. This period of my life climaxed a couple years ago, when I started doing wholesale distribution and ""smoking for free"". There are a number of things I could point to about how in those days I started to feel like something wasn't quite right, but the easiest thing for me to say is simply that for many years I had a lingering feeling that *something wasn't quite right*, heh. Specifically, that perhaps marijuana was harming me in some way, and not just that it was making me a lazy, uninteresting fucker. Now, if you haven't experienced that, then I am in no place to tell you whether smoking is or is not harming you. Always go with your gut. What I will say however, is that it took a lot of personal courage and honest self reflection for me to get over all my intellectual justifications for why weed couldn't possibly have been harming me.

I began to notice things about when I smoked while tripping on shrooms or acid. I usually wouldn't do it until I was coming down, and then just take a quick hit to ""reboot"" the trip. But it was interesting... I could definitely sense it as a feminine energy, a separate, heavier influence that was sitting on top of the ""cleaner"" effects of the shrooms. And often times it would bring this strange sense of unease or paranoia. This of course is partly just due to the drug culture and the overall sleaziness that comes from illegal activity and the kind of people you often have to deal with and be around.

The big step for me was when I started looking deeper in to the things I was experiencing while on acid. This coincided with my starting to develop my nature awareness. I started studying ethnobotany (IE medicinal plants, tinctures, etc.), animal tracking, survival skills, and stuff like that. That stuff will change your life... and even if you can't directly understand why, I hope you can just take it on faith that those were big things for me in terms of figuring things out in many areas of my life.

The other big thing for me is that I've always tried to have a running critique of the logic of domination in our society (full disclosure: I am an anti-capitalist). On the one hand, at one point in my teens I had felt like I was basically an awesome rebel for smoking weed, and was really getting access to experiences that ""the man"" didn't want me to have. But slowly my awareness grew that popular culture is totally inundated with Marijuana. Movies, music, everything. It didn't seem to make sense that this would be allowed unless maybe, just maybe, I was being tricked into harming myself. But this is beside the point, and I hope you don't linger on that particular paranoia haha.

So I was studying plants and their various medicinal uses. I had already been vegan for a few years, but started developing an even deeper understanding of the ""spiritual"" aspects of plants and the concentric rings of disturbance caused by our every action and thoughtform. I think it's very possible to explain these concepts in scientific terms through quantum theory and things like The Secret Life of Plants (which is a book), but I won't go into that here. Again, I can thank LSD for opening me up to that. I realized that every plant had a personality. I don't like calling it ""spirit"" but that is the word that seems to stick. It's more helpful for me to see it as like... our perception is usually rooted in the third dimension, but almost everything has a greater existence, so what we think we see and feel and know may only be a relatively insignificant cross-section of the whole (quantum physics and non-locality really is pretty awesome for helping to understand how this is true). This is what I mean when I say that something has a ""spirit"" aspect.

So in developing a relationship with wild plants and respecting them as medicine, I learned a lot about how ""everything is poison, only the dose matters"" (paraphrasing Paracelsus) and in the particular school of plant medicine I was studying, there is a certain belief that some plants (like Yarrow) are so potent that you shouldn't even mess with them until you've reached certain benchmarks in your spiritual development, because otherwise it's highly unlikely that you would respect it like you're supposed to. 

I suddenly realized ""wait a second, the most important plant I use in my life, one that I use every day, I basically just take for granted and pack into a bowl like it's no big thing, even though it is arguably the most powerful of any of the plants I am working with"". This was like a huge ""holy fuck"" realization for me, and kicked me down the road towards figuring out what the hell I was doing.

A lot of my original research centered around trying to figure out what the shamanic perspective was, because at the time I was doing a lot of reading into that kind of practice, and though I was reading all kinds of books on shamanism, I hadn't found a single one that actually talked about this important drug! How could it be, that there was such a vibrant world-wide tradition in spirit and plant medicine across all native cultures, but so little information out there about Marijuana?

Eventually, I found only two really good surviving sources of spiritual information about weed: surviving Mexican shamanism and traditional Chinese medicine. The Mexican shamanic tradition was really interesting because it identifies Cannabis as a female deity (""La Chingada"") who will destroy you if you don't worship her, but will also destroy you if you get too wrapped up in her. I saw a lot of references to this idea that Marijuana can be used very effectively for a short window to open up your perspectives and toss away some of the accumulated baggage of society's expectations, but that before too long it turns on you, like you're on a magic bus ride and then suddenly the bus turns down a street you didn't want to go down and you're stuck for the ride.

Simply put: **We have no existing framework in Western society or allopathic medicine to account for a responsible and respectful relationship between humans and Marijuana; all that wisdom has been lost. Your drug dealer is NOT a reputable shaman whom you can trust with your spiritual development (or degeneration).**

http://www.marijuana-syndromes.com/ - extensive reading here about Marijuana from the perspective of ancient Chinese medicine, and it is some HEAVY shit. The parts about ""the non-physical effects of Marijuana"" are particularly interesting.

Glenn Morris has an interesting chapter about drugs in his ""Path Notes of an American Ninja Master"" book, where he talks about how Marijuana deads your short term memory, but this is actually quite helpful in some meditation practices because it can keep you rooted in the present moment. Just thought that was kinda interesting. At the same time, it stimulates receptors in your brain that are normally only activated when you're having a new or exciting experience, which explains why someone can be ""perfectly happy"" about just sitting on the couch stoned all day. You're just fooling your brain into thinking your life is interesting!

There is also a really thick, amazing book called Healing with Whole Foods by Paul Pitchford that has a pretty extensive footnote about Marijuana and what it does to your kidneys and Jin (vital/sexual energy).

Hope some of that was helpful for you. I'm not trying to say that smoking weed is wrong for anyone other than me, but moving away from it was a fundamental part of my ongoing maturation into the person I'm meant to be.

It is all I do in my free time. My life is totally based around getting high, and now that I have a vape, it's gotten even worse. I'm vaping during school, at home, basically whenever I get the chance. It's horrible. 

When I'm not smoking I get angry. My little brother has started to notice that I have become easily agitated within the last few weeks. Whenever he points it out I get mad at myself for getting high too much. How do I relieve my anger? I go get high. 

I tell myself I'm going to quit. That, at most, lasts approximately 2-3 days tops. That's because when I tell my friends I'm going to go on a tolerance break, they call me a pussy and that t-breaks are bullshit. When I tell my more trustworthy friends about me stopping, they support me, but they never think it will last long. They have seen me try and fail over and over again. ""just one more bowl won't hurt...""

Finals start monday, and I told myself I would stop after friday. Yesterday I got really high, and I smoked a bowl less than an hour ago. Why do I keep doing this? ""There's nothing wroing with a little sesh, right?""

When I first started smoking, I told myself I could stop whenever I wanted. I now realize that this  not true. I think I have actually acheived addiction, which I know *is* possible. Hopefully this sub can help me ease off the bud for a while. 

**TLDR** All I do is smoke. It sucks.


EDIT: Thank you for the responses everyone. Honestly, I don't want to completely quit. Getting high is fun, and I don't want to stop doing it. But I can't just spend my life doing it. It's the constant usage they I want to quit, not the drug. But your responses have still given me plenty of ideas and encouragement to lay off the pipe, even for a short amount of time.

1356738421.0,35,self.leaves,15ljqx,Some advice from a guy thats a few months clean,pabl0sanch3z,38,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/15ljqx/some_advice_from_a_guy_thats_a_few_months_clean/," This is for those that have an overuse problem, have the desire to quit but can’t even stop for a week because that’s the situation I was in for a few years. (specific advice down page)
I used r/leaves for a while at the end of summer under a different name and this subreddit definitely helped me quit. I promised myself I would come back after I successfully quit to give advice because I know that I wanted more specific advice at my time of quitting. First off I smoked for about 5 years, with 2 years of heavy everyday use. I don't frown upon those that still smoke and I still have a lot of stoner friends. However, I do feel sorry for those friends of mine that I can tell don't enjoy the drug anymore but continue to waste their time and money with it because its they know now. Probably like many others of you, I had tried to quit many times before I was actually successful. I never admitted to myself but I was always afraid of not having any friends if I didn't smoke because so much of my self-identity was as a stoner. That's how I had always seen myself.
I’d first like to give some motivation by stating I truly enjoy life way more now that I don’t smoke ever day.  I was never able to keep a girl for very long as a stoner because I would often blow them off to blow trees with my friends. I now have my first serious girlfriend and I love the great connection I’ve made to another human and the sex that I get to have. (I found marijuana really brought down my sex drive). Another benefit is that I can sleep way less and function more properly throughout the day without feeling. I can also study without taking Adderall now. When I first quit over summer (no school or girlfriend) the first life benefit I found was that I actually spent my free time doing things I enjoyed. The best thing about marijuana is it makes everything fun and interesting. However one of the worst things about marijuana is that it makes doing absolutely nothing fun. I realized after I quit that I had been spends days, weeks, and months at a time doing nothing but staying in my room getting high. Without weed, I was able to get out and enjoy life by doing activities with friends that I enjoyed.  
Sorry for rambling on, here’s some specific advice:
-I needed an excuse to tell my stoner friends once I had quit. (For me, it actually did take failing a drug test and my mom threatening (ended up being an empty threat) to stop paying for school.) Your friends will probably try to pressure you into smoking unless you have a real excuse to quit (they wont believe that you don’t enjoy smoking anymore). Tell them you’re getting drug tested for work or by your parents if youre young.
-Sleeping will be terrible the first few weeks after you quit. Especially if youre a night smoker you will feel restless laying in bed for hours, took about 2 weeks for me to get back to sleeping. (The difficulty behind sleeping and the restless feeling is the only reason I think marijuana might be physically addictive.) My advice is turn that negative into a positive and work out your ass off for a couple hours everyday. It will help with the restless feeling while you lay in bed and you’ll have the time to work out since you wont be smoking and you’ll see a physical benefit from not smoking. Also try reading a book in bed, helped to put me to sleep.
-Some music that helped me:
macklemore-otherside
macklemore- inhale deep
macklemore-fallin
j cole- sideline story
Kendrick lamar- hiiipower
Joey bada$$- hardknock
Asher roth- G.R.I.N.D
I recommend not listening to your favorite smoking music because it will really make you want to smoke.
-Smoking cigarettes helped me when I was really craving to smoke something. I was able to later kick my cigarette habit.
-Don’t get too drunk. My greatest urge to get stoned was when I was hungover to make the pain go away 
-Might help to tell yourself you’re just quitting for three weeks.  Because after those the first three weeks you wont have the desire to smoke anymore if you’re like me. But goddamn those first three weeks are tough. Have the mentality through first three weeks that  something this tough has to make you a much stronger person (and trust me it will).

TL;DR: Quitting is tough but life greatly improved for me after I quit and it is definitely worth experiencing life sober for a few weeks if you haven’t in years.

I'm halfway decent on the local circuit, nothing to brag about, but I take it seriously and can hold my own.  Last night was the first time I think I've ever played not high, and I can honestly say, for a typical Monday night weekly, it was the most personally satisfying sense of fulfillment I've felt in years.  My abilities weren't necessarily improved, but the turnout was a little better than usual (Monday nights can be a tough draw) and I had lots of new tunes to play with, and I was definitely feeling the music and getting a positive reaction with every track I dropped.  Can't ask for much more as a DJ, but honestly, I've played better, to bigger crowds, at hotter parties in the past.  And somehow, had less fun.  Playing high, you tend to dwell on the imperfections much more, even the little slips that 95% of people don't notice.  You regret not playing a certain track 10 minutes ago.  You wonder if the crowd could be having a better time if you were doing something different.  You look past all the people giving it up for you on the dancefloor and wonder why the 6 or 7 people off to the side aren't feeling it.  When people congratulate you and thank you for your services at the end of the night, you think in the back of your mind, they're just being nice, and would have said the same thing to any other dude who does what you did.  Last night I was reminded of how simple it all really should be; focus on having FUN. forget about the imperfect transitions that no one even noticed.  and for the love of fuck,  be thankful that a few dozen people came out to see you, on a cold night in the rain, even though they have to wake up early for work tomorrow.  I had a very rough start to this latest attempt at going smoke free, and still feel a bit ""off"" mentally, but last night was the strongest indication ever that this is the right thing for me to do.

jayeffkay, 
  
You are about to embark on something wonderful, something that is guaranteed to change your life for the better.  Everyone that's ever made this decision has done it and never looked back.   Now it's your turn to stop hiding from the world and actualize the potential you know you have.  Your need for achievement, your drive, your happiness is all contingent on this moment and thankfully, you've made the best decision you can possibly make. The only reason you'll ever look back is nostalgia, and I promise hindsight will always be 20/20.  Remember that you're doing this for a reason, you're doing this to get your life back.  No amount of hard work will ever truly pay off as long as your smoking.   Weed will seem harmless at first, but slowly and surely it will ruin whatever you make of yourself.   Weed is not your friend, it's your enemy - it's your crutch.   No matter how much you want to believe otherwise, it will ruin you. 
  
Look, there's no magic words here.  No one is trying to manipulate you and if you decide to smoke, no one is going to stop you.   Just remember this is you looking out for your future self.  Can you really afford to make the same mistake over and over again?  Is not history doomed to repeat itself without a conscious break?  When will you learn your lesson?  If it's not now it's never.  Remember the eternal return; if you sitting around on the couch smoking pot were to repeat itself eternally; would you cringe in horror? 
  
  
Here's just a short list of why you decided to quit: 
  
* To have more energy 
* To be motivated to do things that matter to you 
* To succeed in the business world (and more generally, at life) 
* To prove to yourself you're more than just potential 
* To actually be in shape 
* To be more confident in social situations
* To be satisfied with the effort you put in;  to never look back and wonder 'what if'
* To be happy, naturally - to be INDEPENDENT
* To have self-control and a clear mind  
* To take responsibility for yourself and your actions 
  
Before you smoke, ask yourself if its really worth losing everything you've (hopefully by this point) worked so hard to achieve.  Ask yourself if you can really afford to go down the same road… again. 

  
Remember:  If you accomplish just this one thing, the world is yours.  This is your tipping point and opportunity is knocking - the question is will you heed its call?

  
Love who you are rather than forget why you hate yourself; its the only way to be truly happy in the long run. 

  
Good luck,

1353197897.0,35,self.leaves,13dj26,A Personal Guide for Quitting Habitual Cannabis Use,,45,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/13dj26/a_personal_guide_for_quitting_habitual_cannabis/,"I am writing this guide because there are many great and working ideas on this subreddit that I would like to compile and add to in one post.

First some background. 

I am a honors Psychology Major at my local state University in CT, 20 years old, and I currently have a standard retail job moving and assembling furniture on the weekends. 
I have smoked habitually for 3 years and only recently quit with much success. When I bought the Magic Flight Launch box a little over a year ago, I smoked daily, several times daily. It was the end of my being sober for longer than a 1/3 of the day. I smoked and vaped because I did not see any problems and it helped in some areas in my life where I had anger issues and bouts with moderate depression. However, it wasn't until relatively recently I realized that my emotions were suffering that I was not able to feel as happy as I was when I was not smoking, nor was a I feeling as many needed negative emotions that were beneficial to me. My motivation to be in shape and play paintball had crashed and my only focuses were just doing well in school and keeping my job and that was it. I found this dissatisfying and realized that I would be better off quitting. This is how I have done it and this is how I believe would be the best way to combat withdrawal and gain motivation to quit based on my knowledge of drug abuse, exercise physiology, withdrawal, the Theory of Planned Behavior and Reasoned Action. 

Why marijuana is a silent addiction

While it may be seen as a harmless drug because the negative effects on the body are very mild, and withdrawal is also mild, the brain reasons that since marijuana, given the empirical data supported by numerous journals, is harmless and poses little threat, should be worth the cost of smoking to have a good time. Unlike other drugs, the fact that marijuana has very mild physiological harm makes it more addictive because the brain weighs the cost/benefit differently. If marijuana were as destructive as cocaine or heroin, most people who smoke marijuana would realize this, and quit or simply never start, just like those who choose not to smoke tobacco. The reason why habitual use for marijuana is hard to break is because the neuroreceptors in the brain that help produce the happy chemicals involved in the marijuana high become less sensitized over time. While this is not as dramatic for marijuana as it is for harder drugs, it is significant enough to cause the withdrawal.

Symptoms of Withdrawal and Combating them

Typical Prevalent Symptoms of Withdrawal that make it hard to quit include: Insomnia, Cravings, Anhedonia(Absence of pleasure from typical things you find fun and/or just harder to just feel good during the day. When you don't feel good (as in you feel more neutral), you tend to crave pot because it gets you high, It doesn't just help you feel normal as many hard drug users need, it literally still gets you high; even if you have a high tolerance, you can always just smoke more and not worry about immediate consequence.

Combating the Addiction

Just a quick run down into the how and why to the methods im about to discuss.

Pretense- you have to want to quit and you have to believe that you can. If you do not believe you can quit, you will fail (you can quit, trust me) If you do not want to quit, you wont... Simple, its a planned behavior and wanting to quit is a good method ur brain will reason for quitting (i know that doesnt make sense but your brain processes some things separately from others so wanting to quit reinforces the reasoning behind quitting)

1. Destroy or get rid of all paraphernalia - out of sight; out of mind, its an effective strategy against combating things that trigger cravings. This goes along with removing yourself from social situations that will trigger cravings such as: groups of friends, smoke spots, specific drug stores you buy your wraps from, etc. Get away from all of it.

2. In my opinion, the absolute best way to help combat withdrawal in ALL forms, regardless of the drug you are removing from your life, is to exercise. Taking up an exercise regimen (particularly in the mornings) will in all likelihood disrupt the withdrawal from seeming nearly as bad. Exercising not only releases endorphins that make you feel good, but it can greatly aid in mood improvement for the long term throughout your days. It will also help you in falling asleep (as i have experienced when i had insomnia until i started p90x. Exercise increases brain activity, and in that brain activity lies your pleasure and mood systems. Most of this goes on inside your middle brain, the limbic system. Numerous academic journals have reported these claims and they have been confirmed to pretty much be incontrovertible. Adopting a good hard exercise program WILL help with a bulk of the struggles in quitting cannabis usage and WILL help re-sensitize your neuroreceptors (the ones involved with mood regulation and sleep). It also a profoundly healthy way to live your life. You might even burn off some pounds you gained from the munchies too ;)  **you will**

3. Delete your drug dealers from your phone and forget everything about them. Its a lot easier to scroll through your phone and not be reminded of pot. Make it difficult to contact them and be lazy enough to not try. I find it hard to not smoke pot when its around, however, when I never had it and was trying to quit, I never bought any because it was the biggest step leading into my smoking.

4. Spend less time talking to the friends who smoke and more time talking to the friends that don't. Even if you dont talk about smoking with friends that smoke, inside your unconcious, you are processing information about smoking and it will sit in your brain. This happens because when confronting and individual who smokes, your brain than remembers (even if not conciously aware of it) the things that make up that person. If you can, cut yourself off from these individuals until you feel comfortable with being able to hold off in all situations.

5. (optional and personally based)- Before I start a t break or before I tried to quit (its happened a couple times), I try to smoke literally as much as I can the night before. I want to satiate my craving in a way where I wont feel the need to do it as much in the following days. I found that this worked for me but it may not work for other people. Ive done this with dieting too, where I eat a ton of food before reducing calorie intake. Before fully quitting, i quit one other time, and it was for a period of months before i bought, smoked and got very very high, and then ive stayed sober since without much craving due to my exercise regimen and the other things i do instead (I do a lot of yoga).

Sleeping!!
Okay so basically, since I did not go into this enough, I would say this would be the biggest pain the ass for weeks after I went cold turkey. The reason why falling asleep is so tough is because, as many of you reading have noticed, pot makes you tired and helps you fall asleep when you need to. Melatonin and Adenosine are two key hormone/neurotransmitters that aid in falling asleep. When you smoke weed it increases these two greatly and because of that increase, over time one's brain adjusts sensitivity to these hormones. After a long period of time of using cannabis the neuroreceptor sites that accept these lovely sleep aids become dulled. They become dulled because they no longer need to be as sensitive to the amount of adenosine coming through the synapse so they dull to resolve homeostasis in the synapse. Fixing this takes time but it can be sped up. First of all, and I cannot emphasize this enough, hard exercise was the #1 thing that I consciously noticed helped my falling asleep and regulating my sleep patterns. Exercise works in this way because it allows for more production of neurotransmitters and increased sensitivity of those neuroreceptor sites. Guess what else raises adenosine indirectly?? Caffeine!! caffeine blocks the pathway of adenosine receptor sites and fills them in. This is why caffeine keeps you awake.  If you drink coffee, stop, the caffeine withdrawal will increase the amount of adenosine that reaches the neuroreceptor sites in your brain. That will help in falling asleep. I would say that if you still smoke and plan to quit in the future, start drinking more coffee so that when you quit smoking you can quit coffee at 5-6 cups of coffee a day(approx 650mg caffeine) and the caffeine withdrawal will increase the amount of adenosine that reaches your neuroreceptors in the brain, which was offset by the desensitized receptors. Like i said, havent tried it, but theoretically it should work. As far as sleep aids go, you can try them, maybe using nyquil, zzzquil, sleepytime tea, velarian, melatoning; ive used them all but nothing worked as well as daily vigorous morning exercise. One more note: adenosine and melatonin are not the only chemicals involved in falling asleep. Other neurotransmitters play indirect and direct rolls as well such as levels of dopamines effect on pleasure and levels of seratonins effect on mood and relaxation. Ive tried taking 5htp(l5 hydroxy tryptophan) with vitamin b6 added. Besides being used as an otc mood improver by raising seratonin, I would suspect it could be a beneficial ally in breaking cannabis addiction. 

Wrapping up: 

So instead of summarizing, im going to give you a planned example of a quitting behavior regimen.

Saturday night: Joe tells his friends he is quitting and he would like them to respect that by not hitting him up. Joe then proceeds to smoke 10 grams and then smashes all of his bowls and set them on fire in a reverse pentagram bonfire. Send your addiction to Hell. (dramatization) (now we're ready to quit)

Sunday Day 0: Joe starts his Exercise regimen in the morning, he is determined to quit.

Sunday Day 7: Joe is only feeling moderate cravings but few withdrawal effects due to his new exercise regimen

Sunday Day 14: Joe feels somewhat better and may even feel significantly better (determined by how long usage had occured before quitting)

Sunday Day 30: One month hump has passed. Few cravings. Joe has more motivation to exercise but may feel he has his addiction under control and considers attempting to contact an old dealer to buy some just for the hell of it. Joe then realizes that's an awful decision and does yoga instead.

Sunday Day 60: By now Joe feels pretty good about himself and his new life away from pot. While occasionally having a fleeting notion of smoking and how fun it could be, he knows that by taking that step would be like taking the first step into what got him into the mess of addiction in the first place. He is much better off.

Sunday Day 25,550- Joe Dies of old age. He is surrounded by his happy family with love him very much for the man that he was. A loving, clean, husband, father, and grandfather of 300 children.

You want to stop smoking pot, because it brings out the worst in you. You don’t like your friends. You tell me that everyday. You argue with them, you think that they try too hard to fit in and you think they care too much about what people think of them. You don’t actually like your friends. You like smoking with them. You like them because you can smoke with them and not do anything else, and that’s all you’ve ever done. So far, all the friends that you “like” the most are the ones that you can smoke with and not do anything productive with. If you keep doing this, then one day when you realize how immature smoking is, you will wake up and realize that you have nothing. If you base your whole life around smoking, then you will not have a life. You need friends that will support you and influence you to do the right thing. This is your life. You aren’t in high school anymore. Your friends don’t decide who you are, but they do influence how you act. You are self conscious about people thinking that you’re childish, and you want to prove to yourself that you are growing up. But you know what’s childish? Spending all your time, money, and energy on weed. Childish is staying up late getting stoned the night before a big test. Childish is only making friends that you can smoke with. Childish is lying around in bed depressed instead of making yourself happy. GROW UP. You are a million things inside. Creative, smart, funny, deep, insightful and kind. But do you know what you appear to be? Nothing but a stoner. I can smell it on your clothes; I can smell it in your car and in your dorm. I can feel the weed on your fingertips and taste it on your tongue, and I can see it in the permanent redness in your eyes. This isn’t who you want to be and you know that. Do you really feel so worthless that you think only smoking can make you happy? Is there really nothing else you value that you could put effort into? What about me. What about all the good people out there waiting to meet you. What about your family. What about YOU. You have so much potential, you can do so many amazing things in this world, and you impress me every day. The way you make friends so easily, how good at math you are, how genuine you are…those things impress me. But the money you spend on weed and the things you do when you’re high do NOT impress me. You say that you get high to relax and organize your thought? Well guess what? Smoking is making you lazy and antisocial and there is no good reason for it. You smoke because you’re scared. You’re scared and stressed and life is difficult, but what you think is helping you, is actually hurting you. It’s time to start enjoying life without being high. It’s time to start making yourself happy. You keep saying that you’re going to stop smoking, but yet you keep doing it, and obsessing over it. If you can’t keep promises to yourself, then who can you keep them to? Don’t do this for me, or anyone else. Do it for yourself.

Hours upon hours spent in Photoshop.  Mugshots and maps. That's my thing.  I should be a Photoshop Guru by now... I'm not.  It's your average news station. Great benefits, shitty pay.

So after a year of planning and growing some balls I went to my station manager today and told him I needed a raise. I gave him my list of reasons why I needed a raise. Basically my workload is higher than what I'm getting paid to do. Also the hours are weird, I've been there for 10 years, and I did an awesome job with the Elections last week... and I did it with shitty, broken-down equipment.  He said he would work on it in the next budget but he wouldn't be able to give me a definite answer until March. So sounds hopeful, right? Wrong. He's going to give me the same 3% he gives me every year and I'll suck it up and take it like the little bitch that I am. But at least I asked for a raise and he knows how I feel now.

SO THEN after I ask for a raise he proceeds to beat around the bush for about 5 minutes, suggesting that he thought I was coming to work high. He didn't come right out and say it.  He was like, ""I've noticed your eyes seem to be dilated sometimes"" and ""you seem distant"" and my personal favorite, ""I've noticed you sometimes say things that don't always make sense.""  Yes boss, you are right.  Sometimes I DO say things that don't make sense. I AM distant. I am all those things you said.  But the one thing I am not is high. He says, ""Well I've noticed you seem a little foggy some days. Not every day. For instance you don't seem high right now.""  LOL. Boss, that's because I'm not high right now.  I take a medication for the bipolar called an anti-psychotic that makes me a little foggy right after taking it.  The fogginess goes away after a few hours. The dilated pupils?  I dunno. It could be a side effect. I'll look into it. Yes, boss. I understand you can take me to the drug test place and drug test me any time you want. I understand it's a liability issue. Yes sir. Thank you for your time, boss.  [end scene]

So the truth is I was high as fuck.  I've been getting high damn near every day for the past 10 years on their dime. I smoke right when i wake up, just before I come in to work.  And I smoke again at lunch, while I'm driving back to work. Yes, I said while I'm driving. Sometimes me and my coworkers will pile into another coworkers van and smoke a bowl or two. At other times we do it right out in the open in the parking lot. One of my coworkers is also my dealer. It's been like this for 10 years.

I know it's out of control. I can't smoke weed responsibly. I successfully quit drinking last January but I seriously have no clue how to quit smoking pot.  It's become a part of who I am. That's DeaconBluez and he smokes pot. I feel like such a bad person because of it. Like it's the one thing that's been holding me back from achieving my goals. This is going to be one of the hardest things I've ever done.  Weed makes the anxiety go away.  It's been there for me through some of the darkest times of my life and actually made those times better. I don't know how the fuck I'm going to do this.  I love weed. It makes doing graphics on shitty equipment for shitty pay that much easier. Any advice?  Should I totally quit 100% or should I just quit smoking at work and while I drive and at other inappropriate times?

Hands down the best thing to pick up if you're not already doing it, is exercise, ideally some form of exercise that you actually like. Books are a great replacement if you like reading, especially since (for me anyway) it's something you wouldn't be doing if you were getting high. Anything can work really. I think the best things to do are anything that lets you get into a ""flow"" state of mind, get your mind off of everything else and just focus on what you are doing. For me it mountain biking. It used to be jogging, and still is occasionally. I still hit the gym, but I did that even when I was smoking.

I love it too much, really. Some people can be high all the time and still live a productive life, but I need to accept that I am not one of those people. I am not social or secure enough in my life to throw time away being stoned. It turns into my default activity, unless I have something else I need to do, I just get high. When I'm high, I don't go out or answer calls. I don't do the things I need to do. I stop acting and thinking like myself, and my relationships and quality of life suffer.

I find myself latching on to the 'good times' in order to keep justifying it to myself. I've gone to work high and it's been okay, so forget about all the times I felt like a stupid shithead for doing it. I set rules for myself, I'll only smoke before bed, but I always find a reason to make it okay to smoke sooner.

It's bullshit and I really can't afford to do it anymore. I've been through this so many times - I've gone through outpatient group therapy, NA meetings. I think the problem is that I've never really done much to fill the void. I still have no idea what I'm going to do this time.

Usually I wait until I have hit absolute bottom - smoking *all the time*, having panic attacks when I can't smoke, shirking all responsibilities. This time, I've been *mostly* okay but have seen myself slipping and it scares and depresses me. Last night without thinking much about it, I got rid of my weed and broke my pipe in half. I put the halves in a jar - I intend to keep it around to try and remind myself how I felt the night I did it.

My problem in the past has always been this: I start to do okay. I am happy and confident without weed, and realize I can live without it. With the weight of dependence off my shoulders, I start to miss everything I loved about it. I start to think about how long it's been and how *good* it would feel to get super stoned for the first time in ages. It sneaks up on me and all of a sudden it's like I have no choice and can't stop myself from smoking. I know that sounds unreasonable - it is - but it's still the way I end up feeling.

I want to be done - I don't want to do this for the rest of my life, and it's not going to get any easier if I wait. I've heard of people 'outgrowing it', but I don't think that's me. I am really lost - I am smoking resin from the broken pipe, I need to boil it so I can keep it without being tempted by it. I want to keep gaining momentum, and I don't know how.

Any advice is appreciated, but mostly I just wanted to vent a little bit. ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_gnu34,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gnu34/i_want_to_be_done_playing_this_game/,

Since I'm here I figured I could share my story. I grew up in a ghetto in Albuquerque NM. When I was about ten years of age my parents got into drugs and liquor pretty bad. My father started slanging weed on the side along with my older brother. Well my friend’s families were also not so well. We were kids with no hope, or guidance, that's for sure. Well we saw what our older siblings doing it, so we tried some weed our selves. I was smoking since the age of 10 till I was 18 1/2. I barely graduated high school. I did it for my mother, she got better and she was working hard as a janitor just to support me. I started off working at Wal-Mart after high school. I didn’t have a car and that was the closest job that would hire me. After a few months I bought a car and met a girl that worked at Wal-Mart that would eventually become my wife. When we 1st met she said ""you have to choose between me and the weed"". Well I choose her and with that I had to stop seeing my friends because that's all we did was smoke, drink, and they would do other drugs as well. I still remember when I was counting my days. In middle school and High school we would all put our money together and buy weed. I thank god every day that I met my wife. Since then I found several good jobs one after another. I eventually found my way into the United States Coast Guard. I have worked in Alaska for two years, San Diego for 3 years, and now I work up here in Honolulu Hawaii. Leaves are very bad for a young soul. If weed was use appropriately I see no harm. I would rather people smoke then drink that's for sure, but still think a drug free life is better. If leaves ever become legal I will choose my health and well being over leaves any day. I only have one life and I want to live a long, healthy, positive, life. My father has passed away, my mother still works hard and is coming to visit me soon (I bought her a ticket). 


excuse my bad grammar, I'm very tired.

When I smoked, I used to love business trips.  The thrill of finding ways to get weed to my destination in ways MacGyver would be proud of and the freedom of being away from those that strongly disapproved of my habit made the hassle of business travel exciting. 

Since I quit 222 days ago (but who's counting?), I have not had any reasons to travel for work until last week.  And the destination? Colorado, home of newly legalized weed.   

Well, I made it through unscathed.  I thought about it. And from what a coworker in that area hinted at, I could have had access.  So tempting. 

But knowing that I would be pissed at myself for giving in, and knowing I would disappoint the friends I have made in this group, I stuck to the straight and narrow.   It was so worth it.  And I was highly productive and got done more than I had planned while I was there.

1326739435.0,34,self.leaves,ojl3d,The best defense is a good offense,daveysan,35,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ojl3d/the_best_defense_is_a_good_offense/,"I have been trying to Leave for about a year now, although fairly half-assedly until a few months ago.  Right now I am on what I believe is day 7 or 8, but I am not really keeping track.  I just wanted to share some things that have helped me and hurt me over the last few months :)

The best defense for me against smoking is a solid offense.  By this I mean be aware of my own limitations and plan ahead.

* If you have friends who smoke all the time, but you still want to hang out with them, find a strategy that works for you.  For me, I cannot go hang out with my stoner friends without bringing a sober friend along.  This helps keep me honest about the cravings, because I have a support sitting right next to me.  You could also just have a real conversation with your friends and tell them not to let you smoke, no matter what you say.

* Better yet, don't put yourself around the weed.  If you must hang out with the stoners, get them to do something with you out of the house, and ask them not to bring their bud.  Go for a walk, ride bikes, grab lunch, invite them to your house for a meal.  Do your best to entertain THEM so they dont even realize they arent high.

* Don't count the days.  This site seems obsessed with day counting, and I have actually found it counterproductive.  Like going on diets, you are missing the bigger picture if you do a count.  This is a long term decision that you have to tackle on a daily basis.  For me, just THINKING about weed makes me want to smoke, so it is better to not think about it.  Counting days means I am focusing energy on pot that I could be putting somewhere else.  It doesnt matter what day I am on if I am not smoking anymore.  Everyday is the present, this is my new reality.  I do not need a trail from my bad habits, I need a clean break!  So dont say you are on day 3, or 7, or 35, say ""I don't smoke weed!""  That is a much more powerful message, and makes it harder to justify relapse.  I often say, oh, I am on day 14, I guess its ok if I smoke once.  WRONG!

* Go to bed earlier.  Wake up earlier.  It seems to help me for some reason.

* Realize you are not your mind, and you are not the addiction.  Also, make a pact to better yourself.  You only have one life, live the one you want!  I get the hardest cravings when I am feeling depressed.  I have largely used weed as an anti-depressant for the last 3 years, but  I am becoming convinced that pot, or any anti-depressant is a temporary fix, not a long term solution.  You can use it to get some good feelings going again in your life, and then jump from that back into a reality you want.  Long term use becomes a crutch though, and development not only slows, it stops because you have reached a comfort zone.  So if you are a long term user for depression, realize that this ally is no longer helping you!  And because you crave a healthy body and mind, you need some new approaches to this problem!  So the next time you are feeling depressed and you really wanna call up your dealer, look at yourself.  Look at the craving.  Look at the FEELING.  See it.  Hi!  And then tell it, well, you may be valid, but the answer you have is NOT working, so too bad!  And then find something that works for you.  The emotionally mature will know that we can help these feelings go away by actively doing something else.  It could be something as complex as writing music, or something as simple as going for a walk.  The important thing is to start developing new outlets.  And you know what, if you are at a low enough point that you just need to stay home and let this day pass you by until the bad feelings go away, THAT IS OK TOO.  It is better to lose 1 day of your life than to fall back into smoking, wasting countless more days.  1 is more manageable than many!  Just remember, doing things is better than not, so work towards being more active!

* Make some friends that don't smoke, and hang out with them!

* Identify and avoid the traps you like to put yourself in.  If you cannot hang out with your stoner friends without smoking, it looks like you need to stop hanging out with them.  If you cannot sleep without the weed, try and find activities to do around the day that will make you tired.  Get off that butt and off the internet!  If you have a medical license, cut that shit up!

* Don't falter!  Taking a month off does not earn you a joint!  It earns you a more balanced and happy life.

Lets be honest, any drug alters your brain chemistry.  I really dont know how long it takes to break addiction, but I am guessing it is more than a month or two.  So try and commit yourself to building a life that you can enjoy without weed, and putting in the hard work until you reach it.  Maybe it takes 6 months, maybe it takes a year, but at the end of that time, you will be a new person who is able to evaluate their drug use with a sober mind.  This is something you CANNOT do right now.  So dont worry about when you will start again.  I know you love smoking, we all do, that is why we are here, we just need to Leave so that we can get back to life.  Maybe in a year you will get to a place here you can comfortably smoke once a week/month/rarely.  Maybe you will never smoke again.  Either way, the hard work starts today.  But you know what?  It builds character, and even if no one else cares that you were able to break the habit, you can know that you have gained some control over your life, and that feels good!",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_ojl3d,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ojl3d/the_best_defense_is_a_good_offense/,

It wasn't the plant that made me the dull, uninspired, lazy, and anxious guy that I was for more than 3 years; it was my lack of self-control and my fear of facing lifes ups and downs head on. 

While still abusing the plant, I had lost the ability to enjoy social interaction, I was completely fine with doing absolutely nothing all day, I was planning my day to day life *around* smoking weed when I should have been doing it the other way around, and what I felt was the worst negative aspect of abusing mary jane was when it started taking priority over my life moving forward. 

Now 2 months sober, I have regained my mental clarity, my enjoyment for conversations and being social, and the correct order my priorities always should have been. Also, I'm actually thinking about what I want to do with my life in a serious way. I'm happier in general, as I have a sense of inner peace that is just lovely, and my friends and family have noticed it too. Additionally, my confidence has risen, and my ability to recognize and feel my emotions for what they are has improved. I feel good, guys.

To conclude with an important point, all these positive results did not magically appear just because I quit. You have to be trying to better yourself all the time. That will never automatically happen. Life in general can feel like it's always an uphill climb, but if your attitude is positive and your mind is open, the hill will become a little less steep everyday, and you might find that you are enjoying the view from up there.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1gkm0x,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1gkm0x/2_months_since_i_quit_after_toking_for_3_years/,

http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1a9cvs/just_found_out_that_i_have_a_brain_aneurysm_that/

I was feeling really down at the time and did not really know how severe my condition was. 

After writing that post my condition got worse and I had to spend 13 days in the hospital. Those 13 days were by far the worst of my life. I experienced mind boggling pain for 10 straight days and at one time was on 12 different drugs including morphine, ketamine and stesolid. I got 10mg's of morphine 8 times a day for the first 10 days, I couldn't take a shower or go to the bathroom without help and relied completly on others to take care of me.
After a couple of days in the hospital I overheard a conversation between two neurologists that were overseeing my case, I heard them saying that I probably had a stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.
After that my world shattered, I honestly thought that I would not be able to live a normal life, I refused to see anyone other than my parents and did not really speak for a few days. 
To make a long story short my pain was caused by a mistake made when I had a lumbar puncture a few days earlier. I was leaking spinal fluid at a fast rate and that caused unthinkable pain.
I still have a brain aneurysm and I still can't smoke but finding out that I can live a normal life meant everything to me. I have a new outlook on life and for the first time in quite some time I find that I am really happy.

Ever since being released from the hospital I've been ecstatic. I've started to live in the present and I'm doing better in virtually all aspects of my life. I don't procrastinate anymore, when I see a girl that I fancy I go speak to her, my work has improved and my confidence has seldom been better.

Overall I'm quite thankful for the experience, without it I probably wouldn't have made any drastic changes to my life. I will have a brain scan every 6 months for the next few years but according to my doctors the aneurysm shouldn't hinder me at all if I live a healthy life.

On Saturday night I got together with 10 old college friends for a Halo 1 LAN party.  I predicted there'd be weed there and had intended not to smoke. Unfortunately I gave in when offered.

After being offered my mind instantly recalled a really euphoric instance of playing Halo when high.  I thought about how great it would be to experience that again with these good buddies.  I let in and smoked a couple times out of a pipe.  I went to bed at 3am then woke up at approximately 5am with guilt and anxiety.  I could not get back to sleep.  

Looking back at my recollection of that euphoric instance of playing Halo, it sunk in that it was just that, an instance.  The *vast* majority of highs were dissappointing, fleeting- sometimes they were downright uncomfortable.  This time, even after a three month ""tolerance break"" of sorts, the high was disappointing and nothing like my presmoke moment of nostalgia expected it to be.

I am still discouraged over how powerless I can be around the stuff.  Though I am trying to remember I made it 3 months w/o and have turned down smoking in the past 3 months.  So, I am not absolutely powerless.  

In a strange way, I feel a bit depressed because it wasn't great. I've dealt with depression my adult life, and for the past years weed was how I self medicated.  Like I said, it rarely was satifactory, but each following toke held the hope of feeling good.  It was like scratching an itch, ""maybe I'll feel better if I smoke""??  Often times my tolerance was such I couldn't even get high, but if I scratched that itch there was some relief in just that.  I think why I feel a tinge of depression is in that it really doesn't make me feel good, so I don't know where to turn that will.  I need to remember I am only 3 months into seriously trying something else besides living for that next toke with the hope/illusion I will feel good. I am finally addressing it with talk therapy and a more honest and thorough reflection on my anti-depressants without the muddying factor of weed.

For me quitting takes practice.  It's been a long road and isn't over.  A feeling of powerlessness still remains and maybe is good, Pride Cometh Before the Fall and all that...

My wife never smoked but she always accepted it was my 'thing' (but never encouraged it either). She was also part of the reason i quit, i owe her more than a stoned husband every night. The final straw came on a Saturday afternoon after a friend called round and we shared a smoke on my balcony in the morning, my son of 11 months gave me a confused look as if he didn't know who i was when i came back inside to ask my wife if she wanted a coffee, i remember my words slurring, i remember it being some pretty good weed we smoked.... Although his look probably meant nothing, he was just giving confused looks as a child does sometimes but it one of the first realizations that  helped me see that stoned me isnt the real me. 

I started smoking in the Netherlands after a vacation with a friend there in 1999. I picked it up full time once i returned to the UK, it was great. It helped me in every way possible at that time in my life. It then moved from being a fun activity to one where i needed to smoke just to feel normal again. Like being high was my normal state. I would justify this by assuring myself of the pressure i have in life and the things ive been through require some form of release. Little did i know that my release had become my trap. 

I was a grower and a smoker, never a dealer. I quit the growing when my wife became pregnant because of fear of being caught. My house smells so much better now! 

I always assumed i could just step away from smoking anytime i wanted. I didn't even put the pieces together and see that the vacations with my wife were not enjoyable for the first week was because i was withdrawing from weed. I used to think i could quit anytime i wanted. 

I thought weed helped me get over my brothers death, my best friends death, daily stresses in life and all the turbulence i was faced with. But it didn't really. It just put them on the back shelf of my mind. To be opened later.  2 Months after quitting I am m trying to get to terms with a lot of things i went through in my 20s. I don't even remember my 20s properly. I'm 30 now. Damn that sucks balls.

The first week was hard. No sleep, panic, anxiety, sweating, cravings, cravings, cravings...... 

The second week it got better, i was down to sleep problems and frequent cravings

After a month i was just down to sleep problems and the odd craving

2 months later i still dont sleep properly but its much better. I am actually ok on 5 hours sleep. Much better than i was after 10 hours sleep if i had a smoke the night before. Strange but true. I still get cravings but my mind switches off from them much better

If i can help in anyway let me know. Here are my 'pro tips'

- If you dont exercise, start now. If you do exercise already , step it up to the next level. My lifts and stamina went through the roof after stopping. Focus on cardio activity for tiredness and detox but also try to get involved in something more fun like boxing or dance or whatever. You will need some mental stimulation as well as physical and a new hobby or passion that is truly healthy is always good for mind and body

- If you are like me, the slightest smell of weed brings back the good old days. Stay away from places where you will be exposed to smoke. I have to accept that total abstinence is the only solution for me and temptation never went well with my personality.

- in the first 3 weeks you will find that you have an overwhelming desire to self improve. During this time it is critical you follow up on these thoughts. You need to prove to your new self that he is better than the old self. The old self had thoughts of doing his Masters or taking a new job or helping out at the local charity event but he never followed it up. The new self has much more motivation, prove it to yourself that hes better and make sure you follow up. If you dont make changes then you might feel the need to go back to smoking because you cant see the point in continuing as it is.

- Try not to drink to much. If you need to replace your addiction, replace it with something healthy. I was always a great chef and the family cook for years but im now taking that to the next level. I invest time in making complex and new recipes. It stimulates my mind. Food is my new addiction. Good food thats is. No, Great food. Consider that i exercise a lot too lol to counter act the negatives of enjoying food too much.

- Find a support network if you can, visit /leaves every time you feel an urge and remind yourself you are not alone. There is always another guy out there with the same urge to pick up a joint again. Spur each other on and avoid relapsing in unity, not alone.

- If your friends cant respect that you want to stop then they are not friends. One or two of my friends laughed at me, even tried to discourage me. I gave them a few chances because i thought they are just finding their own justification to continue smoking which is fine by me. Only one friend ended up accepting my decision, the others continued to smoke in my direct company even after i asked them not to do it in my face. They are no longer friends. Surprisingly they never contacted me since. Friendships built on smoking weed are not real friendships.

- if you are finding it hard to deal with issues that resurface from your past take assurance in the fact that time will heal them and at some point you need to address them so why not start now. Many of these problems are old and from years ago so they only hurt in your mind now, not so much your heart. If you know what i mean. If you really cant deal with them, seek professional help but try as many different things as possible before reverting to weed. You will eventually find that weed was never the answer

Finally, take each day as it comes. Don't plan to not smoke forever, just plan to get through TODAY. In the first few days plan by HOUR, yes it seems crazy but it helped me. It does gets easier. Eventually.

Best of luck to you all and thanks again to all the weed vets that shared their stories on quitting.

I am 21 years old and would consider myself a functional smoker. I go to college and work and am successful while still blazing weed. However I have learned quickly never to smoke before going to work or college.. The key is to smoke after your responsibilities are done for the day.

I have always had access to very very high quality marijuana, through certain relationships in my life.. So when I smoke I get STONED.

I have learned there are different highs and levels of being stoned. Some nights I smoke and must not take as deep of a hit or as much, because I will feel high yet clear headed and functional. I will feel good and laugh and have an overall good time. 

Then there are those times where I take a big rip, cough a lot and feel really cloudy and messed up. This is the time when I feel too stoned to drive(yet do anyways due to the pressure of friends claiming to be able to drive no matter how stoned.) When I am like this I feel bugged out, My eyes feel like they go a little wonky and I have trouble making eye contact with people out in public. I think I get paranoid that I will look like I am retarded or something, not even so much that I think they will know I am high.

Powerful eye drops help me feel better with this.. But if I happen to smoke on a whim somewhere that I don't have eyedrops.. Man I end up regretting it.

Along with my eyes feeling weird I also say weird stuff and smoking before a business meeting would be very stressful and awkward for me if I happened to be ""too stoned"". I would feel self conscious about what I am saying and if I am sounding correct.

I also get paranoid when I am this stoned, even if I am at home with nothing to do or nothing happening that day I get a feeling that I am suppose to be doing something or that someone is going to show up and I will be too stoned to be normal towards them. I also get paranoid about health stuff. I have asthma and often I will find myself tripping on my breathing, trippin on my hearbeat, trippin on a bug bite or some other health issue.

All of this combined makes for some unpleasant times when stoned.. and I find myself saying in my head ""You are an idiot! Why did you smoke, why do you ever smoke.. You are tripping now, you are scared and paranoid and should never smoke again!"" 

However whenever I become back to normal or come down I find myself wanting to smoke.. Despite how I felt before, I want the high back. My mind convinces myself I was just stoned and talking crazy when I wanted to quit.. And now that I am sober I want that high, it is appealing.. It will be fun!

it's a viscous cycle.

Now some history.. I am very pro marijuana. I don't consider it a drug or a harmful substance that should be banned or compared to alcohol. A lot of people in my family are functional smoking members of society and I was raised to know that.

However I think it is something that can be abused and shouldn't be used everyday as a crutch. I think it is something best used moderately.

There is a flip side to this.. Tolerance.. As all of you may know if you smoke regularly you develop a tolerance and you can handle getting stoned without being ""too stoned"" (Even though I smoke everyday and I still get ""too stoned"" often). So if one uses it moderately it seems that every time you use it you will get way way too stoned.

Seems the best option would be to stop all together.. But it's hard.. Seems like it's a complex relationship with marijuana. I know people claim there isn't an addiction with marijuana.. But I think there is a psychological addiction to it maybe not a physical one. I think that you become addicted to the act of it. Grinding the weed, packing the bowl, passing it to friends.. You become addicted to the social aspect like sitting in a circle, enjoying the conversations you have while becoming altered.. Making an event out of it. Also it makes activities more fun, you find it fun to smoke a bowl before bowling, before watching a movie, before playing a video game etc.. etc.. Then when you go to do these activities it becomes second nature to reach for the bowl first.


Anyways I just wanted to kind of tell my perception of it and see who else could relate. I would like to stop smoking and depending on it but it seems it always is there and always so easy to come back to.

Up until then I had been smoking daily for years. I thought I'd share some of the changes I've noticed since quitting.

I'll start with my health. For a while now I had had problems with persistent coughs and coughing up mucus. I also had serious problems doing any sort of activities involving running. Since quitting, my lungs have been feeling great. It made me realize how much pressure (damage) I had been doing to them. I am much healthier now, and can play sports with out feeling like I'm suffocating.

I'll keep it brief for changes in finances. My bank account is in back in 4 digits as of Tuesday for the first time in year$. I really dont know what to spend my money on now.

Lets talk sleep. Sleep was tough the first few days, but I didn't have any problems after the first week, nor did I have to substitute any other substance as a sleep aid. Overall I have much more energy in the mornings and getting up is significantly easier. Something else I noticed was that in the first week my dreams were much more vivid than they were when I was smoking. I dreamed at length after quitting.

The last area I want to touch on is the psychological changes I've noticed. In the beginning I was more irritable than usual, but that passed. Additionally, towards the end of my smoking, it made me very paranoid, obviously that doesn't happen anymore. Overall I feel much sharper mentally, and am much more outgoing. Also I have a short term memory again.

While I haven't seen some of my stoner friends as much as I used to, I really cant think of anything negative that came out of quitting. The first 3-4 weeks were tough, but right now I have no cravings for getting high and feel like I've gotten my life moving in the direction I want it to.

My last smoke was on July 1st after 6 years of smoking 2-5 times a day. This last week has been really tough with all of the typical withdrawal symptoms (nausea, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, insane mood swings) but I feel like the biggest thing that has helped me is telling the people who care about me about this decision (family and close friends).

These are the people who warned me years ago that I was abusing the herb but still loved me anyways. I admitted to them this week that, although pot can be enjoyed recreationally by some, I am not one of those people. Their love, support, and encouragement have REALLY helped me this first week, especially with the emotional aspect of the withdrawal.

I just wanted to give up little update.  I'm on my 23rd week of no weed what so ever.  I've been a 10+ year smoker, and 5 of those years were chronic usage.  Also, it's been 26 weeks of no cigarettes!  

It was insanely hard, so if you're reading this and thinking about doing it, or just starting the process of ceasing to smoke up, just know that it is very possible to achieve and stick to.

The first 3-4 weeks were really hard for me because of all the withdrawal symptoms.  I decided to do it cold turkey because I know my personality, I'm an all or none kind of guy.  I can't just stick to weekends or special occasions.

The symptoms included night sweats, insomnia, and if I did some sleep, I would have lucid dreams.  Also the my anxiety went through the roof.  I would have moments of self doubt, anxiousness and paranoia.  But i knew that will pass because of this awesome subreddit.  Reading about what other people were going through and the support that they got was such a tremendous help to me.  

But after some time, things just started to get better.  My memory was on point.  I could recall information without having to concentrate.  I would wake up and goto work without feeling like i was in a haze.  My motivation was improving.  I felt that little voice that would say 'fuck it' wasn't around as much, and it was replaced with 'just do it already!'.  

Most importantly, I felt like I have freed myself from something that held down my full potential.  Not many people understand that feeling.  Its like a personal victory that the people around me don't quite see.  

So, to everyone who's going through the steps of quitting, I wish you the best of luck! Nothing worth having comes easy, so work hard, keep focus and be patient.  Take one step at a time!  I also want to thank this small little community for their constant support and guidance.

1367149742.0,32,self.leaves,1d9noe,16 days...why I quit and some other thoughts,JimNCrik,34,2,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1d9noe/16_dayswhy_i_quit_and_some_other_thoughts/,"I'm 31, started smoking about 17 years ago, have quit a few times in the past, usually because of school obligations (longest clean period was a year and a bit) and otherwise I would smoke usually on weekends or whenever I got a chance. The longer I go without weed, the easier it is to remember how much I love it and the more difficult it is to remember why I'm giving up. I'm writing this to help me remember for future cravings and maybe it will also help some of you. So here are the main reasons I'm quitting.

1. I love being smart and being able to engage more meaningfully with people at work and socially. I hate worrying that I'm not performing at my best, especially because my job is high responsibility and people's lives are at stake. I hate worrying that the people I work with can tell that there's something off about me if I smoked the night (or even 2-3 nights) before and may eventually suspect drug use.

2. I love the initial high, but 2-3 hours down the line I just feel shit and have a compulsion to smoke more. The day usually ends with me feeling fat, slow and a massive headache that I just wish would go away.

3. I hate how unhealthy I am when I smoke. I eat absurd amounts of food, lay around watching tv or playing games, and am much less likely to go to gym. And the damage from smoking itself.

4. I'm damaging my relationship. My fiance who was always fine with my smoking has recently (with my increasing use) realised that I have a problem and thinks I need to quit. I've also managed to intertwine my weed addiction with a porn and fap addiction which ends up replacing actual intimacy with her.

5. I procrastinate and end up not doing properly (or not doing at all) tasks that I know would be constructive and improve my career or me as a person.

6. I take unnecessary risks. Example: the last time I brought weed I was literally parked next to a cop car, I knew I was being a complete moron yet still finished the deal. Blind luck that I didn't get bust.

Those are the main ones I can think of right now. From experience I know that strong cravings can come even a year down the line, and probably for the rest of my life. And when I haven't smoked for a long time it's really tempting to think, it's been so long, just one or two tokes won't kill me, and it will be so nice. But I hope I can remember that I've been there before and have proven time and time again that it's never just one or two tokes- its the beginning of a binge, and while it may not kill me (not short term anyway), it can only make my life worse. After the initial high I'll just feel shit, and I WILL end up regretting it.

tl;dr the longer I stay clean the more I tend to forget why I quit and relapse becomes more likely- these are the six main reasons I am quitting.

I discovered that my laptop would allow me to remove the CD-ROM drive and insert a second battery.   So I got my boss to approve an additional battery. 

I noticed that the battery was smaller than the CD drive, leaving a space inside my laptop.  I got the brilliant idea that I could wrap my stash in foil, mold into a cube and place it behind the battery and the TSA would never notice it.  The foil kept the smell in, and an xray would not show anything odd. 

This worked well and the adrenalin rush going through security was exhilarating.   

One trip, my boss decided to come along and we traveled together. He was slaving away on some spreadsheet on his laptop (different brand than mine) on the plane and his battery was dying.  He says, ""Well your laptop must last for hours with two batteries, let me borrow it.""  

Uh, sure.  I hand it over and he goes to town, and the laptop starts heating up.  I can now smell a familiar skunky odor.  I have the window seat and was ready to do an emergency evacuation.  I see him making a face as the smell wafts around the cabin.  

At this point, we get the announcement that it is time to shut off electronics.  We land and get off the plane and he mentions to me how much he hates flying, especially when the guy in front of him smelled like a woodland animal.  

He mentions that flying must not agree with me either, since I was as pale as a ghost.

I love reading everybody's questions, stories, and support here. 


I got into weed around my sophomore year of high school and have been smoking everyday (I wish I was exaggerating), multiple times a day for about five years. It all started when I met my boyfriend at the time, lets call him Mike. Mike had been a drug user for about two years before me, and was waaaaaay deep into it (hard drugs, people. this boy liked to get f---ed up) and naturally, I was curious. I never got into hard drugs, but weed was different.. Weed let me relax and not think about things that were getting me down. It didn't tie me up in an addiction and gave me a way to meet people I wouldn't have met had I not been a stoner. It was great, until it wasn't.

Mike had got addicted to xanax and oxycontin and didnt want to work out the problems in our relationship. After 3 long, hazy years, I cut all ties with him.. but not our weed dealers. I kept my habit going, introduced my friends to weed, became closer to people who smoked as often as I did.
Fast forward to about a year ago, going to college but not really heading in any particular direction. Taking liberals and failing them because I'd rather be ditching class, smoking weed with my ""friends"". I decided I wanted to stop going to school so I could really start ""focusing on my interests"". What I actually did was smoke a sh-- ton of weed. Which brings us to today.

For me, smoking weed is not the same as when I first started. When I smoke now, I become extremely paranoid and afraid. I can't talk to strangers and I feel that ""everyone knows im high"". I get so tired and lazy.. TOO relaxed. I can't keep interest in things and I feel that my thought processes don't make sense! can't remember anything new anymore, can't make new friends, very self conscious, ashamed of my habit, and now am surrounded by people with the same habit as me: smoke weed whenever we possibly can. I have nothing in common with these people other than they smoke my weed and I smoke theirs.

Well, I'm done. I want to meet people who will help me grow. I want to care about another human without wondering if we're really friends or only close because of our shared ... bad habit. I want to start a book and FINISH IT! I want to hang out without wondering who in the circle has weed today. I want to be able to focus, to learn something new, to sew, to play guitar, to grow up! It's time to stop being the kid that I was and start choosing myself over weed.

I can't even remember the date. I was in a bad state. Overweight, smoking daily, grades failing (college not high school), life looking grime, and even thoughts of what would happen if I ""wasn't"" here. It was a bad state of my life. Since then, I've been hitting the gym daily 4-6 days a week, benching from 120-almost 200 now. I have never been more clear minded. I joined a dating site and now even possibly have a relationship going as i've already had my first third date. The only relationship I've ever had in my life. I even had my first ""intimate"" moment with someone after I stopping smoking, something I never thought would happen after quitting bud. I never knew what was out there that I was missing. My friends, who still smoke, are still ""stuck"" in this haze of bud I see. I gave all my glass and stuff to my friend, who really did appreciate it even though I felt bad contributing to his problem a little. I didn't wanna smash my glass as I did pay upwards of $150-200 for my stuff and am trying to sell it over smashing it. I originally compensated by using alcohol as a replacement, I went 10-15 days straight getting drunk out of my mind, I stopped only cause my right side of my body was hurting, not even cause I wanted to stop. I was able to calm that down and had my first drink in 2 weeks yesterday and feel fine today. I did get attracted to cigarettes as a replacement but that was only cause of finals I was so stressed out and needed a release. Now I'm only on those Blu disposable vape cigarettes, which, yes are still bad but not as bad as smoking the real thing and yes, I will eventually quite those, it's just harder I guess.

I think my life has drastically improved since I was smoking. There's no urge to go back to it and no desire to either. If i'm offered, I even picked up a jar of bud at a friends house, I don't even think about smoking it. It just crosses my mind as ""poison"". Life has so greatly improved. I'm so happy now. I read books daily instead of my constant ""family guy"" marathon or bad movie marathon that weed used to make better. IDK where i'm going with this, i'm just saying everything DOES get better. It improves so much after a short amount of time. I can't believe what I've been missing and I'm much better off now that I know what I can do WITHOUT bud.

Even before that my relationship with the plant wasn't that healthy... hell I was smoking almost every day for another year too now that I think about it (it's such a haze).

It was a week ago today that I smoked my last bowl. It was also a week ago today that my girlfriend told me the spark was gone, beginning the start of our breakup.

I've made a few attempts at quitting... late last year and also earlier this month. Both times I made it maybe 4 days before relapsing. There was always an excuse - ""oh im getting a bag for a friend, might as well smoke a little"". ""Oh i'm going to smoke on the weekend anyway [with friends], might as well smoke Thursday""

Usually if I have a fight with my girlfriend I'll just smoke. Or chances are I'm already high and in need of a top up.

I started to realise I needed to quit when I was smoking a Q in a weekend. I'd wake up Sunday mornings at maybe 8 am, smoke a few bowls then go back to sleep, only to wake up at midday to do the same. By the afternoon, I was bored shitless and just smoking bowls endlessly trying to get the high back.

But it finally took this break up to snap me out of my smokey haze. It wasn't even the weed that caused it - not directly, anyway. But, once we'd broken up and it was just me, I thought, what now? Usually I'd just smoke a bong... but I want more than that.

I started to realise the spark was gone for me too. Not just from my relationship, but from my own life. I'd been so consumed with just enduring the daily grind so I could get home and get high, I hadn't stopped to realise how utterly bored I was with my life. The only thing I looked forward to was weekends with her, and even then I'd happily waste them getting high together, only to regret we didn't actually go out and do something.

The first few nights sober was tough. I won't lie - I wasn't sober, I was drunk. It wasn't so much the quitting as the breakup - my friends all wanted to look after me, which was what I needed.

Then last Friday, it finally sort of started to sink in. I have no plans this weekend. Usually it's either with her, or mary jane. This weekend - nothing. Marijuana let me be completely passive about that - I had a whole weekend off and didn't have to do anything but smoke pot!

But this time, it was different. The haze in my head was clearing and I wanted to just feel ALIVE. So I hopped online and found a cheap place to stay a few hours away. On a beautiful stretch of road I'd always wanted to see. Then I packed a nights worth of stuff into a backpack, and simply drove.

The thing is, that weekend was absolutely the most fun I have had in a long time. Weed had made me so complacent in my life, it was like things simply were the way they are and that was never going to change. I used to love just going on random roadtrips if I had a day free... but with weed, I'd talk myself out of one and just sit home smoking instead.

My only regret is the time I lost to marijuana. I used it when I was bored, I used it when I was stressed. I used it whenever I didn't want to face the real world - which was a lot.

But now, I really can see that I don't need it. Last night I was particularly struggling with the whole breakup, and had a fleeting though ""why not just one bowl?"".

But no. It's time to move on with my life. These are both things I loved for so long - but for all of the wrong reasons. I was just going with the flow. Every time I got to a fork in the road that is my life, I'd take the path of least resistance. Which way is everyone else going?

I am so glad I found this subreddit. If it weren't for the motivation here I would never have realised how many people go through this same thing. I thought I was stupid - ""pots not addictive you idiot"".

I'm an addict.,Enough_ls_Enough,35,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/17wm25/day_3_addiction_is_defined_as_continuing_to_do/,"Hello everyone! If the wall of text is intimidating, please read the bold part - it's the thought that's help me stay clean for the past 3 days.

I've been a daily pot smoker for the past 5 years. During the first two years of daily smoking, I'd always ensure to get whatever I needed to get done before smoking and relaxing. Grades were good, the girlfriend was awesome, life was generally pleasurable. Little did I know that that pleasure I derived from my life, came mostly from an artificial source (not from within me, but from dried plant matter).

The last three years, I've been smoking every day, all day. Neglecting my duties at school (4th year CompSci student), and I've seen my GPA take a massive hit. It took me a while to come to this conclusion, but it's not necessarily one problem (me) or the other (pot). It's both. There are some people with such addictive tendencies (ie, myself, and let's be honest - if you're on /r/leaves, you have that addictive tendency as well), that it overpowers their will to.. do, to be. 

Like the title states, addiction is defined as continuing to do something in the face of mounting consequence. And the consequences have mounted into a fucking mountain. I'm ashamed that I let it get to this point.

Not only did my GPA take a hit, my social life did too. There are people who smoke all day with their friends, and I am not one of those people. I consciously made the decision to shut my self in, smoke pot, and play video games. All for what? Nothing that's going to benefit me. I lost my girlfriend, though it was a rocky relationship, it lasted 6 years. I think the final straw was my absolute decline in attitude. I was not a pleasant person to be around, I was child-like, I nagged when something didn't go my way, and I got pissed when something happened that I didn't want to happen.

Fast forward a little. About two weeks ago, I found 1 (of 3) of my pet snakes (boa constrictors), upside down and dead. The other two were healthy, but this one - she was my first boa, she got me into the herpetology world. Upon further investigation, I found out that she regurgitated her last two meals (I keep them on a steady and slow feeding schedule) and she had essentially starved to death. If I had been paying better attention to animals that I've put into my care, she'd probably still be alive. 

At that moment, right then and there, I packed up all my glass (about 1500 dollars worth of high-end bongs [Roor and an Illadelph]), put it in a garbage bag, and threw it into the big recycling container outside my house. The smashing of the glass, that noise, was fucking liberating. The sound of my glass shackles breaking free. 

I thought that would be the end of it (I'm a bong smoker, I hate joints). But, nevertheless, within 2 hours, I went to the store, bought some paper, and finished my stash. Told myself it would be the last. The next day, I found myself at my dealers doorstep, without even thinking. I grabbed again, and finished it. I was smoking 3.5 grams a day, sometimes up to 5 grams. I would roll 3 massive joints, smoke them back to back, and roll 3 more and continue - my only real break from smoking, was sitting there and rolling the joints.

I neglected everything, everyone, myself, my school, my grades, my family. All in the name of getting high. Fuck it. Fuck it all to hell. I'm so ashamed of what I've done to myself, I know I'm a bright individual capable of achieving good (maybe even great) things, but I threw it all away. There's no way I can salvage my GAP and get into Grad school like I had originally planned, there's not enough time left in my Uni career.

**This past Friday, I shut myself in, neglected studying for my midterms (which are in 2 days!) and smoked pot, and watched all thirteen episodes of House of Cards on Netflix. There was one specific episode - I think maybe the third or the fourth, when they're sitting at an AA meeting, and one guy there said, and I quote (well, paraphrase actually, since I don't remember it in its entirety):**

**""Every day I don't drink, that number gets bigger. I'm sitting at 5000 days now, and the bigger that number gets, the scarier it gets. Cause I know, all it takes is one drink to go back down to zero...
I can't control my fear of it, but I CAN control the zero. FUCK the zero"".**
**At this moment, tears were uncontrollably streaming down my face - such a great opportunity at life, and I shat it away.**

**I flushed my stash (~2 grams that were left), threw away the papers, and here I am.**

This is my third day of not smoking, and while I can say it's tough, and there are cravings, and I don't know how to reward myself (since I used pot as a reward, always) when I've accomplished something. But if there's anything that's stuck with my these past three days, it's the quote from House of Cards: ""I can control the zero. FUCK the zero"". Just thinking about it gets me teary for some reason. It's so easily applicable to marijuana. All it takes is one drag, and I'm back down to zero, and these past three days of seeming HELL would have been for nothing. I will NOT let this happen.

I want to move on with my life, I want to achieve things. Normal people do not smoke all day, every day, skip class, assignments and midterms, then drop all their courses mid way through the semester (this happened to me last semester).

It's hard being in my head, it really is. I've always been a hyper-active,  antsy child, and weed really helped counter-balance that. I'm a deep thinker, and I tend to over analyze everything, panic attacks are no stranger to me, and I've had a few in the past few days. I've been smoking a lot of cigarettes unfortunately, but that's next on my list of bad habbits to kick.

I want to get better guys, cause if I don't, I genuinely fear I'll end up taking my life to end such a pathetic existence. I don't want to do that, I want to live, I want to finish school, I want to get married and have kids and watch them grow up. 
I DO NOT WANT TO RELY ON SOMETHING SO HEAVILY. SOmething that shuts me down for the day, and lets me ignore responsibilities like it's nothing.

What's helping me counter-balance it now, is the sheer thought of how pathetic I would feel if I was not able to accomplish this. I can do this, and I will. 

I CAN CONTROL THE ZERO. FUCK THE ZERO

I don't go to meetings anymore, but I learned a lot from hearing how other people suffered, what they did to fix it and how they're doing now. So here's my story in case it will help you.

I smoked daily for years. Woke up, rolled out of bed and smoked. Came home for lunch to smoke. Puff puff puff passed. When everyone else was passing out on the couch, I was still smoking. I even waited for the SO to go to sleep so I could enjoy giant rips from a bowl all to myself. I prided myself on being able to smoke anyone under the table, and being able to graduate *cum laude* in a challenging music-related program while high every day.

Besides being obviously fully functional (in my eyes, anyways), I also justified my usage on self-medicating my nausea-inducing migraines. It also helped with the debilitating performance anxiety that I had. I didn't call it performance anxiety, that would come much much later. No, at the time I just thought there was something wrong with me, and the only way I had been taught to deal with something wrong was to be angry at it and then ignore it as best I could. Trees were how I manged to ignore it for my entire college education.

A year after graduating, I decided I wanted to become more healthy both physically, mentally, and spiritually. That meant of course, cleaning up my act. I decided that it was time for me to stop smoking. 6 months later and about 3 of those days successfully tree-free, I realized I *might* have a problem. 6 more months were spent trying to drag my ass to some type of meeting, but each time I almost went, I just couldn't do it. They were the worst 6 months. I canceled performances because the trees weren't helping my anxiety anymore, and I would stay at home smoking and crying and hating myself and smoking more so I wouldn't think about it. I couldn't really afford the amount I was smoking daily, but my SO's roomie grew hydro. I would drive by their place during lunch breaks and if no one was home I would let myself in and meticulously gather crumbs from the roomie's stash, hoping he wouldn't notice.

At the end of those six months, I had to go visit family for a couple of weeks. I went without a stash and got clean (seriously, we have it pretty easy when it comes to that....I was pretty grumpy but that's about it). The day I returned I went to an AA meeting. MA was virtually nonexistent where I was, but I obviously needed structure and accountability. I'm half Jewish and half this and half that, have lived in several different cultures so it's pretty easy for me to see the universal truths in things - and there were a lot of pros to going to meetings. Little known fact; a lot of original AA'ers did hallucinogens/entheogens and many are Buddhist. Higher Power is a power greater than yourself and does not have anything to do with some sort of God unless that's what you want it to be.

I was so quiet the first month. I never spoke up, never shared. I was ecstatic about being sober for the first time in years, but I was terrified in those meetings. Turns out that's how most people are when they start, and everyone else is pretty much faking it. For some reason, I finally got a sponsor, who I can honestly say saved my life. They didn't turn me away no matter what I admitted to. One of my favorite speakers at the meetings I went to was a guy named Jim, a real old-timer. One of those guys who'd been around so long he entered AA when only the truly fucked up, end of the line people were admitted. He had crazy stories about his mother sexually assaulting him, and blackouts that lasted for days. He always said each time,""and I only got my 24-hour chip once. Once."" For some reason I went up to that man, and proudly declared, I'm only going to get my chip once too! Literally that next week, Jim had a stroke while sharing his story, lingered in a coma for a few days, and then died. So now I'd made a promise to a dead man that I'd never relapse. Great.

Those next few months were rough. Being sober was difficult enough as it is. Friends were disappearing (it wasn't such much fun having a friend who claimed addiction to trees), life was more real than it had been for, well, ever, and my sponsor was making me work the steps hard. Described by one of their very colorful analogies, to unclog my fucked up plumbing, I had to let everything come to the surface before it got drained. And that's pretty much what happened.

After about a year, I started wondering if maybe the total abstinence wasn't my thing. I knew that trees could never be a part of my life again(although 'forever' is definitely a term I avoid - one day at a time is the best stress-free outlook), but I felt that alcohol and other substances had never been a a problem for me. To thine own self be true right? I mulled it over for about 3 months before remembering that I had had bottles of untouched liquor in my house during the Worst 6 Months. So I started drinking, and haven't had a problem. Naturally this made AA a difficult place for help. At the same time, I'd been traveling with some very dogmatic AA'ers, which really twisted the program for me. I ended up leaving it, fairly remorseful, but I feel that my non-abstinent protocol could be harmful for addicts who need abstinent role models. Just my opinion.

I still gained many things from AA. Their many sayings are cheesy, but oh so useful. Whenever I have serious cravings that last for more than a few days, I start going to meetings again until it passes. It's not the best method, especially for anyone who is more relapse-prone, but so far it has worked for me. It's tough, but going to meetings, saying my clean date and proclaiming I'm an addict reminds that I do have to do work if I want to stay clean and not just drug-free (white knuckling as they call it....a dry alcoholic is not really any better than a drinking alcoholic without changing the way they deal with life). Hearing stories helps. Hearing people in early sobriety share things they'd never shared before, and being that accepting witness for them, also helps a lot. We all do fucked up things, being able to share them without rejection is a powerful tool for an addict.

In the end, asking for and using help has been my best method of improvement. After all, my way of thinking and dealing with life was what got me in the mess. My solution to life's woes was trees, and lots of them. AA gave me a new toolkit for dealing with life's unwanted challenges, and I'll always be grateful for that. I'm grateful that I'm not only tree-free, but I'm also a better and more caring partner, friend, relative and general member of society. I don't need a drug to feel relaxed or productive. I can do it on my own now.

**TLDR;** Trees addict. Tried quitting on my own for a year, couldn't. Used AA instead and got a sponsor. 6 1/2 years clean and counting.

It's awesome!,Cmon_Just_The_Tip,42,11,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/12wcc8/about_2_months_into_a_total_lifestyle_change_its/,"I've been smoking pretty much every day since the age of 15, that makes it almost 10 years. 

My daily consumption averaged 3-4 joints a day in high (indeed!) school, decreasing to about 1 a day over the last 5 years. 

2 months ago I woke up one morning feeling literally like CRAP. This was very unusual. It forced me to have an honest assessment not only of what weed was doing to me, but of me as a person. My life, my objectives....deep stuff. 

The day after, as I was walking to uni, I forgot in which room my class was (after 10 weeks of going there). It took me at least 5 minutes to remember it. That was pretty much it, I decided to call it quits.

My problem was, I needed something to replace weed or else I would fall back into it, guaranteed. I had 2 big breaks during my life (6 and 9 months) that failed because of this reason. I needed a true objective that required my full, lucid attention. Or more than one. I needed a REAL challenge. An ambitious, total lifestyle change.

This is a list describing what I've done to turn my life around. I hope it helps you. I sure did help me, I literally became a different person and I wish I'd done this earlier. Life is fucking amazing right now.

- Quit weed
- Cut off losers from your life, specifically stoners, alcoholics, negative, angry people, lazy people. They will try to bring you down and make you feel bad for doing what they don't have the guts of doing.
- Eat healthy (no junk food, no soda, no sugars)
- Work out HARD (crossfit, kettlebells, olympic lifting...the hard stuff)
- Take up Jiu Jitsu/ MMA
- unsubscribe from r/politics and generally every whinging subreddit whose content comes from depressed weird kids in their 20s that sit on their ass all day
- Quit videogames, porn (very important), tv shows, movies, commercial tv...and reddit (or at least subscribe to things that improve your life ONLY). Replace them with things life this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nasIq4E9nNg
- Spend time outdoors (beach, hiking, riding a bike/motorbike...anything!)

and now the most important ones.

- SOCIALIZE
 
- Get into PUA (pick-up artistry). I was very skeptic initially, seemed like a bunch of sleazes manipulating women into sex. However, after more investigation I realized that there are no magic tricks. PUA requires you to be a FULLY adjusted, fully independent and fully confident man. You have to sort your shit out in order to sleep with really hot women, period.

Furthermore, it's a great way to get rid of social anxiety and awkwardness. Approaching 15-20 hot women a night by yourself when they're often hanging in groups simply will not happen when you're high (at least for me!). It really is one of the hardest, most terrifying but most rewarding things I've ever done. It teaches how to beat those fears that are all in your head. 

I now realize weed was giving me a crippling social anxiety that cost me many lays I could have gotten if I just had the courage to approach more women and had the simple ability of not giving a fuck, being less self-conscious. 

I suspect it also cost me friendships and social life in general. Youtube and videogames are so appetizing when you're baked as fuck, recovering your muscles from a hard training session or after you dealt with cunts the whole day at work, isn't it? But ultimately, my experience taught me that if you abuse it, it becomes a poison that condems you to mediocrity. And no-one will come to rescue you.

Whatever you do, make sure it's something hard, challenging and that offers appetizing rewards. I can promise you it works. Weed is the last thing in my mind right now (i've been offered to toke dozens of time by my housemates, it simply has become indifferent to me.)

I wanted to thank all this subreddit for the inspiration it provided, you guys are great! I hope we can all keep living a life where we feel no attachment to any substance.

Well, I'd been meaning to quit for a while.  I was smoking a copious amount of reefer, approximately a quarter pound of high grade a month.  I had approached my old man 3 weeks ago to tell him I was heavily self-medicating.  2 weeks ago, I was drug tested at a small oil company.  My boss told me he could tell my work was being affected.  Anyways, they let me keep my job if I don't fail any drug tests.

One week in, I experienced no observable withdrawals.  Almost immediately, I started sleeping better.  My lungs feel healthier, and my wallet is a lot heavier.  

I was addicted, but primarily psychologically, as I haven't noticed any physical manifestations of the addiction yet, nor do I expect to.

I suppose I have alot of incentive to keep quit.  My job is good, and it will enable me to migrate to the privatized space program in several years, assuming I maintain my employment and fail no drug tests.  To be honest, working on the space frontier sounds way more exciting that smoking up everyday, groundhogs day, repeat each time.

I'm pretty fucking elated.  My boss, parents, mentor, and close friends are all really supportive.  Fortunately, I introverted heavily whilst medicating, so I don't have a big social circle to pressure me into smoking.  I'm grateful.

This is an awesome subreddit.  I'll update at two weeks, but I don't really expect much news, aside from, ""I'm another week closer to joining the space program!""",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_120fo7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/120fo7/my_first_week_sober_in_6_years_notes_inside/,

I just wanted to encourage everyone saying that the first 3 weeks are definitely the hardest and now its pretty easy not to smoke. I've dealt with loneliness, anger, anxiety, nightmares, and fear head on and I'm alive and sober to tell the tale. 

Once I was able to deal with these issues in a way that wasn't getting high, then I knew I was powerful enough to keep dealing with them sober.

Some tips that have really helped me:

- r/leaves ! dunno i could have made it this far without this community

- drink tea with half a lemon! i know this sounds silly to a stoner because there's no high, but half the addiction is preparing and then sitting with a repetitive action. I've been drinking at least 3 cups of antioxidant green tea a day instead of inhaling smoke into my lungs. 

- work out. The times I've felt the worst, I realized I just needed to do some cardio and burn off the bad energy. I know you might not want to work out, but do you want to sit around hating yourself and wishing you could smoke? I've been taking spin classes and am going to run a 5k in February to motivate myself to keep doing cardio. Feeling the burn in my lungs and throat also reminds me of one of the many reasons it was time to quit. 

- treat it like a breakup and keep yourself busy. Make the breakup FINAL. none of this ""we were on a break"" crap. If you have plans to get back together then you'll never move on. 

- Find an accountabilibuddy. My boyfriend in Ohio quit at the same time as me, and sometimes when I've wanted to smoke I didn't want to disappoint him and tell him I wasn't strong enough to do what I said I wanted to do.

- Tell a lot of your friends that you're quitting and tell them the extent of the problem you had. i even posted to facebook saying I love r/leaves and am not going back. Believe me, you won't want to back track with 20+ people you told you were over weed. 

- Make friends who don't smoke. In college, quitting would have been much harder cause my friends and i would always get high and listen to music, but now I only have 1 friend I would smoke with regularly. I took a week and a half long break from seeing her until I knew I could watch her smoke a joint without joining her :)

Best of luck everyone! If you're here then you're on the right track.

It's easy now. Much easier. Make it through the first 3 weeks with the willpower that got you that far, and the rest should be not nearly as painful. Also, I've been having far fewer nightmares the last few days. Hopefully, it'll stay that way.

A short story and some perspective.,sooibot,34,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/q0qtz/8_months_a_short_story_and_some_perspective/,"On June 19th 2011 I checked into a rehab facility. It wasn't totally my choice, but then again, if I was against the idea I wouldn't have gone in the first place. I was 26 years old, and my life was going nowhere. One of the councellors liked to joke that stoners become the couch, I hated it everytime she said it, because it was true. I was surrounded by alcoholics, meth-heads and heroin-junkies... and they were just like me. For the first time in my life I met people who not only struggled with the same social issues, but understood what I was going through.

Since marijuana takes quite a while to detox from, it took me a while to get my feelings back, but when they came, they came in a flood. I cried, a lot. I was grieving the loss of a friend, a friend who had been there for me whenever I was sad, bored or angry. A friend who I thought would always be there for me. 

Every day I sat in groups where people described events where their powerlessness over their substance lead to damages. At first I had nothing of real value to share, because I didn't hurt anyone, or so  I thought. I was a placcid stoner, who always had access to funds, and since being a stoner is rather cheap, I never did anything horrible to get my drugs. I realised something though, I wasn't living. I was allowing myself to slowly trudge through life, not chasing anything I wanted, just being okay with being. I was destroying myself by wasting my most precious resource, time.

I went to a secondary facility after the first 24 days, and I stayed there for 3 months. Here I learnt how to function as a part of a community. If the first 24 days were about breaking my denial, the next period was about everything I needed to do to stay clean. It was an intensive program, and it involved a lot of work, but I did it with pleasure. For the first time in my life I understood why I did the things I did, what my limitations are, and how to overcome adversity.

I discovered that I'm a one man pity-party. That I'm addicted to anything from gaming to relationships. That I don't stand up for myself, and let people walk over me. That I get into the friendzone with girls because I fear intimacy, and would rather get my intimacy in safe doses. Every day had an epiphany.

To me marijuana became Mary Jane the crazy girlfriend. She loved me very much, and I her, but we were just not good for each other. She isolated me from my friends and family, because she was jealous. She demanded constant attention, because she was needy. We had massive fights, but I always forgave her. She always supported me through my problems, but never gave me a tangible solution, because she needed me to need her. 

A lot has changed in 8 months, but a lot still stays the same. I still struggle with motivation, but at least I'm not depressed anymore. I have dreams again, oh sweet sweet subconscious trickery! I'm not a cynic, because I don't need to justify how shitty the world is to rationalise smoking. I love my life more now than ever.

This is the longest I have voluntarily gone without weed for... years!  Here are 7 benefits I've experienced in the last week alone:

1.  Wake up in the morning feeling refreshed and energized; no more groggy, hazy feeling in the morning that requires a strong cup of coffee to fend off.
2.  Better in control of my diet; I was a health and fitness nut during my stoner days, but prone to excessive binging on candy and other BS.  I don't go through that anymore and the associated regret I would feel the next morning.
3.  The natural ""highs"" of life feel much better than any high that weed ever brought - movies are funnier, good feelings come naturally, and I'm more optimistic about the future in general
4.  Money saved.  My habit cost me ~$60 a week to sustain; now I have extra cash to spend on foods I like, hobbies I enjoy, or just money to save for the future.
5.  Increased social contact with friends and family.  When I was high, voicemails, emails, and texts would pile up in their respective inboxes, often becoming a chore to respond to.  Now, I am actively seeking out the people I care about in my life.
6.  My values and morals are clearer to me and I feel more confident speaking up for them and acting on them.  I don't feel as pressured to be somebody else.
7.  My eye contact is much better!

I hope this provides some inspiration for people questioning whether or not they should quit.  These are things I noticed in just 7 days!  Brighter days ahead.  I couldn't have done it without the support and sense of community I find on this subreddit.

Solo habit gone. This might actually be easier than you think. And this first step alone is a huge accomplishment.

The next step is how you interact with your friends. When you inevitably hang out, they might still try to get you high, or not. Either way is okay. At least you're smoking way less at this stage. Your friends may eventually decide they don't want to keep getting you high if you have no bud, and they'll be less inclined to smoke you up in the future. This solves the problem of influences that might drag you back. By this time, your social drive will be back and other friendships will happen.

The most important thing is: Keep your mindset positive. Always focus on the wonderful improvements related to quitting, not the minor agitations or cravings.
Think about how great it is that you can breathe better, think clearer, remember more easily, chat smoothly, your motivation is back up, life is less of a struggle, things happen more automatically, you're saving money, appearing more attractive to sexual partners, etc.

Do yourself the generous favor, decline the next opportunity to get a bag and stop the solo habit. Life gets so much better, every day.

1)Can't even write anything concrete. I was gonna say ""that feeling of amazement when looking at or thinking about something new/in a new light"" etc. but I honestly haven't had that experience since I started. It got to the stage where I was mindlessly gorging on doritos staring at the TV having trouble formulating a sentence , barely aware of what I was doing.

Gained:
1)Memory.
2)Diet improved. (less munch)
3)Get out of bed more easily in the mornings.
4)Not worried about getting caught.
5)Not dealing with unwashed, zoned out dealers and their terrible time keeping.
6)Energy.
7)Have improved myself in numerous ways, now spend many evenings teaching myself to cook. This is a skill that I enjoy, benefits my wallet and waist and I can share with others. Weed only filled one of these categories (and only just about).



*****8)SHEDS of MONEY!I calculated that I used to spend about 6,500 a year on weed.I had to go buy bonds the other day because my savings account offered too low of an interest rate. I now actually have a problem of having too much money as opposed to not enough. My girlfriend asked if we could go on holiday by ourselves for a week or two this summer. I dont have to think about it.
9)Respect of my aunts and uncles. They knew I smoked, I didn't lie about it. They didn't mind too much but they thought it was a bit juvenile, cliched and a waste of time and money.
10)More comfortable in social situations.
11)Grades have gone up.
12)Don't have to worry about drug tests for internships this summer.
13)Don't have to socialize between the hours of 11-4 to smoke when peoples parents are out or asleep.
14)Dont have a cough (I smoked weed mixed with tobacco, the norm where I'm form).
15)I'm focusing way more on the long term, what I'm gonna do when I'm out of college etc.

I strongly urge all of you other leaves to make out a PRO/CON list on your phone and look at it when you get cravings or excuse yourself to the bathroom and read it if offered in person. I say no without a sense of accomplishment or self regulation, it doesn't even register. It's basically an automatic reflex at this point!

Long Story Short:(...I'm new to reddit!)
Since I look at what I've gained vs. what I've lost I no longer think about it as ""giving something up"" but ""stopping"" because I've gained way more than I've given up. This simple mindset makes all the difference. 

Thanks to everyone on leaves for opening my eyes and removing the ambiguity I felt about stopping.

I am in my mid fifties and have smoked pot daily for most of my adult life, quitting briefly twice before for employment drug tests.  I can't say pot was a huge problem in my life, I have a good job and I have seldom thought of it as having a big negative effect on my life. 

I guess I quit for a number of reasons, initially because of a job opportunity. My family and friends will tell you I was one stressed out person for weeks!  I went through all the usual - couldn't sleep, no appetite, highly irritable, etc.  but all of that has passed. 

When you smoke all the time, you are so unaware of the effects of pot when you aren't really stoned. My head is so much clearer now that I am clean. My energy level is through the roof, I sleep much better but I don't sleep as much. My dreams have returned!  I am just so in awe of the difference it makes in daily life.  I used to smoke everyday because i always felt stressed. I still get stressed, (doesn't everyone) but it passes and I feel better able to deal with the root issues instead of just covering up the feeling. 

I have quit a couple of times before and slowly gone back, but I don't plan to return to my old habits. It is tempting some times, but it does get easier every day and I keep reminding myself what a slippery slope it is when you just choose to ""smoke occasionally"".  I do not want to give up this new clarity that I have found. 

For anyone who is thinking of quitting, I would just encourage you to stick with it and know that it does take time to start feeling the benefits. Take it day by day and you can get through all the crappy withdrawal stuff. There is a whole new world at the end of the journey, at least there has been for me.

This is currently the longest I have gone without smoking since I became a habitual user, and, I gotta say, I am very proud of myself. For the last three months, I've been trying to quit, but I never made it more than two weeks without smoking, so this is a big accomplishment for me.

To anyone who is trying to quit right now, but is afraid that it is too hard, or not worth it, trust me, it makes a world of difference. The beginning sucked, but after about a week and a half, I really started noticing a difference. I have a lot more energy, my depression has gone down, and my brain activity has increased immensely. At the height of my smoking times, I'd say my brain was only working at about 45% or so, but now, it's probably upwards of 80%. Last weekend, my friend complimented my vocabulary, a compliment which haven't received in maybe over a year.

I'm not out of the woods yet, but I'm certainly on the right path. I'm still depressed, but for the first time in a long time, instead of just hating myself, I realize why I'm depressed, and I actually know what I can do to fix it. My social skills aren't great, but they've improved immensely. I've gotten closer to a lot of my classmates, which is a step in the right direction, and I'm actually starting to understand my classes, as opposed to just scraping by in them. I saw my parents this weekend, and the told me that they noticed I seemed much better than the last time they saw me, which was around Christmas time.

It's really amazing to see how much has changed in only one month. my mind is still a bit hazy sometimes, but I'm betting another month without smoking will do wonders. For the first time since probably high school, I feel like I'm in charge of my own life. 

tl;dr I have been clean for a month now, and just about every aspect of my life has improved. Even though it's hard at times, not smoking is worth it.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_17w6b7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/17w6b7/one_month_without_smoking/,

This is a dummy account. I made it to share my story with you in the hopes that it might help even one person. And it's a self-post, so I get no karma from your upvotes.

Until a few months ago, I was a complete marijuana &amp; nicotine addict in every sense of the term. I smoked an eighth to a quarter oz every day, lost friends/jobs/opportunities because of my habit(s), stole from my parents to buy weed, smoked weed and cigarettes all day erryday, and pretty much hated myself because I was unable to quit. I'd even started doing other drugs (Shrooms, LSD) because I could barely get high from weed anymore because I smoked so much.
MINI TL;DR: I was a huge marijuana and nicotine addict for 7 years (ages 12-19).

Then, in one weird afternoon, everything changed. It was weird as shit, and I hope you guys don't think I'm trolling you. Here's what happened: I drank a cup of coffee and listened to Kanye West's song ""Power.""

The coffee made me feel fucking great. And the song made me feel even better. And here's what I realized: *Coffee makes me feel better than weed does.* I smoked another few joints and cigarettes and felt terrible, which confirmed my realization. I tossed the rest of my stash, went home, watched Inglorious Basterds, and have been drug-free and sober (except coffee, which is definitely a drug) for four months.

Instead of obsessing about weed and building my day around my trips to the drug dealer and my smoke breaks, I obsess about coffee and plan my day around my cup. I drink one cup of strong black coffee in the morning, listen to Kanye and the Pulp Fiction Soundtrack, clean my room, work out, and feel great. Weed and cigarettes made me feel terrible and fucking lethargic. Coffee makes me feel quite good. They're both drugs, and I can obsess about the rituals attached to consuming either one, but one makes me feel good and the others make me feel bad. 

It doesn't feel like I've ""broken my addiction"" – I just have a different, and more effective, drug of choice.

TL;DR: I switched to coffee.

Hope I help at least one person with this post – if nothing else, I'd like to impress upon you that tiny, obvious realizations can have far-reaching and profound implications.

Thanks for reading.

So day 10. It's a big milestone for me because I always relapse around day 4 or 5 and I feel like its sticking this time. The desire to call my dealer has greatly decreased and its getting to the point where I don't even think about it anymore. It hasn't been all roses though. For whatever reason, I thought when I quit, a burning desire and un-tapped motivation would surface and take over me. That is not the case. I am still spending far too much time on reddit or watching re-runs and not pursuing all the things I want to be pursuing. That's not to say there havent been huge changes in my attitude. Whereas before doing something as simple as laundry or going to the store was built up in my mind as a huge momentous exertion, now I do those things with ease and without thinking. Its amazing how much more often I do the dishes, keep my room clean, etc...

Just wanted to say that quitting hasn't been a magic pill that cures everything, but it helps a lot in changing your attitude towards living a normal life. Now time to get out there and ROCK IT! I'm looking forward to seeing this paper chain become a dragon throughout my house and it will serve as a daily reminder of how strong I have been.

So happy i didn't.,tokedguy1,34,5,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/zticd/nearly_took_that_1_toke_in_so_happy_i_didnt/,"I lived my teenage life without any motivation left to do anything, emotionless and had ADD type symptoms induced by smoking...

On my 20th birthday back in October, my friends had a ""Godfather Blunt"" ready for me, that was my dream i wanted to smoke it for so long, it had probably 4-7 grams of super lemon haze in it too, my favorite smoke... i thanked my friends, showed my appreciation but let them smoke it, they looked at me in shock and confusion, after a while i was convinced to take just 1 toke...


Before that 1 toke, i was having an amazing conversation with the new friends i met, my speaking skills where so amazing i actually got surprised, before when i smoked weed i was trying to speak and i couldn't really speak without hesitation and anxiety anymore and i had little self esteem left for many reasons but mainly because of smoking weed daily and not socializing with society.

After that 1 long pull from that blunt, a couple of minutes in i was saying something and had 3-4 people paying close attention to what i was saying, it was apparently a very interesting topic about my breakthroughs... Then i had the words scramble, i literally pictured the words scramble as i was trying to say them, it was very upsetting for me because i didn't want to live a life without a clear mind anymore, i missed that clear sense of well being and that was my high...

After that i actually started to zone out and stopped speaking, it was horrible, i was probably fighting the buzz, ufcourse i didn't need to all i needed was to ride it and let go but my mind wen't on full defense mode.

Anyway since then i stopped smoking for a couple of months, everything was great, my life was getting back in order, i was able to sleep without insomnia  (i normally smoked at night to help me sleep but turns out i had a bad sleep cycle because of thaqt as i ended up waking up in the afternoon), I stopped wheezing and coughing, i was more relaxed, calm and more on point with everything, my job became easier and i had more patience when doing everyday tasks. First 2 weeks was soo hard, i couldn't stop thinking, regretting, stressing, I thought soo much in the end i started to think about thinking... i thought i was going crazy i wanted to run to hostpital and admit myself and then i don't remember what happened but all of a sudden i managed to control my thoughts...

Shit i think i went skits for a bit, Anyway after the few months of not smoking, after new years i tried smoking a bit of weed after missing my remembering memories of my old smoking buddys and going to link them... i couldn't speak, i couldn't breath properly i started panicking, i forgot why i stoped smoking in the first place and my mind was set on building my tollerence and controlling myself... This led me to smoking for a couple of more months...

2 weeks ago i wen't on a vacation with my uncle, he is an x ent, He used to smoke half an ounce a day in his time, he noticed oddness in my behaviour, and talked to me, asked me if i smoke weed and i told him i do, he told me why he quit and what hes been through and i managed to remember why i quit last year. Since then i haven't smoked anything.

Anyway Yesterday i met my friend he rolled a nice spiff and lit it up, he passed it to me, i automatically took it while we where having a convo without realizing its in my hand, i looked at it and returned it.

He looked at me suprised said oh shit... and asked me why i didn't smoke it, 

I pointed out to him how he was acting once he lost his stash that day, he couldn't control his anger he was getting paranoid and stressing out over a bit of herb and once he found it he became a different person he became depended on this, spends over £600 per month to feed his habit, he has 2 lovely daughters, a lovely wife, he could be buying them soo many things with that he could be spending time with them right now instead of doing this, he realised it too but couldn't really put it in his mind but i think it got to him. 

He managed to convince me to take 1 toke, it seemed harmless to him i took it my mouth was filled with smoke, lots of things startted to flash through my mind such as how i would regret this after, i am actually going to diapoint myself etc so i breathed it out without pulling it into my lungs and you know what i feel proud about it. 


I will probably never smoke weed again, not even 1 toke, I realised it just takes 1 toke to bring my old mentality back, the one which never ever brought me anything good in life and just pulled me back from everything i wanted to achieve.

In fact I refused to smoke weed up until my sophomore year of college.

Everyone said I wouldn't get high the first time I smoked, but I did. I felt amazing, I laughed like a kid again for the first time in so many years... 

And there was more...

I could once again dream of my future like I could as a kid.
I could accept the hardest parts of my past and learn from them to shape my actions in the future.
And for a year, I had convinced myself it was weed that let me do all of this. That weed was helping me be my true self.

I would look at the city from atop the hill down the street and see not the city before me, but what the city could look like. No brownstones, just glass skyscrapers with wide swaths of green gardens stretching as far as I could 'see'.

Weed helped me say things I had waited a long time to say.
For me, weed got rid of the fear of uncertainty. But truthfully, it made me not care what others had to say. A good trait for certain things in the right dosage, a terrible trait when you lose yourself on a path of self-destruction.

And, unfortunately, there was more...

While high I would write things without fully understanding the purpose or significance of writing them. I would also act without fully understanding why I was doing the things I was doing. I was not in control of my own mind... I was out of it.

I even thought smoking weed saved my life. Up until I lost the best connection I have ever had with anyone else on this planet. I also scared a handful of amazing friends in the process...

I thought I was saying goodbye to someone who had lost their way. I thought that they went off the deep-end, that they were gone forever. But that wasn't the truth. They wanted me to find myself again. And the lesson cut so deep into my mind that it's permanent.

But I went to far in the process. It took me too long to put the pieces together and I lost irreplaceable connections.

Words alone cannot describe how sorry I am to everyone I affected. And the truth is, I slipped up for the very last time.

I can't keep living in the past. And for the very first time, I don't need nor want to live in the future. 

I want the present and everything it has to offer.
I want a clear mind. A strong body. So cigarettes, you're gone too.

When I started smoking, I really enjoyed it. The feeling of complete oneness with everything was my zen. However, I was so internalized when I smoked that it was hard for me to get out and talk to people because I just wanted to be left alone with my thoughts. After smoking for some time, I had started to see that my 'friends' were not good people. I dropped all of them, except one. She stuck by my side through everything, without her, I don't think I'd be here. I went through a rough period of depression where all  I did was smoke. My friends (who were at this point, my enemies) tried to make my life miserable by convincing others to hate me. I had enough, so I applied at a university 6 hours away hoping to get away from everything. 

After settling into a new apartment in a new town, I didn't have any friends. So that meant no hookups or connections, so I was forced to be clean. For about 3 weeks I went without smoking. It was the most productive 3 weeks I'd had in a long time. Eventually, though, I had met a really cool guy, and after a while he told me he dealt weed (ents seek out other ents subconsciously, I swear). I was so excited. I had started smoking more than ever in huge amounts. I had a solid connection and life was good. 

Unfortunately, my academics took a back seat. It became so bad for me that smoking was the only thing that got me out of bed in the morning. My credit card was maxed out, I had no money for food and if I did, I'd buy a bag. I couldn't afford to pay my bills. I had nothing.  **How did I get here?**  Weed used to fill a void, but now it just makes me feel empty. I needed a  *change*  so I decided to leave my new town after 8 months. 

I'm back home now, in the town where, as far as everyone else is concerned, I am nothing more than a ghost. And despite everything, I am more content now than I have ever been. I don't have my stoner friends egging me on to smoke. I can, for the first time in my life, focus on myself and getting back to where I need to be. Now I go for walks everyday, I even go wogging (another redditor coined the term, it means jogging so slow you're practically walking). I've spent time getting to know my mom and grandma. I've lost 5 pounds in 3 days because I don't snack like I did when I smoked. I eat three meals a day and nothing more. I don't cough when I wake up, and instead of smoking a bowl in the morning, the first thing I want to do when I wake up is open the blinds, crack open my window, and breathe.

I don't have any real sob story but my story is that I'm a 22y.o college student. I first starts smoking when I was 18 and it never became a daily thing until recently. I would smoke with my friends once every 2-3 weeks in high school. Even going into college It was still a once in a blue moon thing. Then as time progressed it started turning into a daily thing around may 2012. I smoked more to mask my problems so i didnt have to face them or the drama that came along with it. Now I want to quit because I do notice it making a negative impact on my life. I shouldn't be using weed anymore to mask my problems, i know I need to face them head on now. I don't enjoy or have fun smoking anymore bc it's just become a habit now, like breathing. And now I find myself wanting to smoke alone more than doing it with people bc I find smoking with my stonet friends to be boring now. We don't have fun and laugh like we used to. I also notice it making an impact on my short term memory. Its hard for me to retain information and keep a conversation going now and my head feels foggy all the time too. So a question for people who have quit for awhile now, was this the same for u, and if so, did you short term memory start getting better after you quit? So here's to day 1 of quitting. I smoked the last of my herb I have. Later I plan on throwing away my marijuana card (I live in CA) and my bong. Any advice you guys can bestow upon me? I wish the beat of luck to everyone else!

EDIT: it's day 2 and my relapse urges are really strong. it's especially strong when im not feeling productive like right now. ive already been to class and gymed it and i dont have work today either. what are some other things you guys do to be productive?

I'm irritated that I can't.  I'm anxious, worried about death.  Depressed for what seems like no reason.  My stomach is having ridiculous pain, making noises, and I have sweaty chills that are both hot and cold.

I was at a family gathering today.  Not my family.  But people kind enough to let me eat with them on easter.  I had to lay down.  I pretended that it was something in the food.  The truth was that I am in pain.  Unnecessary pain.  Pain that I caused to myself for no other reason than my own bad choices in life.

I think the lies and propaganda from the anti-marijuana crowd has created a counter culture of pro-marijuana bullshit.  The pro-marijuana crowd has talked about how it's not a real drug.  That it is only psychologically addictive.  Well that may be true for the old weed.  But new weed is 10-100 times as strong.  It should be treated with more respect.  It's like drinking straight moonshine.

Maybe I'm just a corner case.  But I didn't think it'd be hard to quit.  I've tried before, but failed.  Looking back, I had no chance.  If I had known about /r/leaves I would have laughed in yall's face.  Who needs help quitting weed?  It's not even addictive.

I think people need to be informed.  The depression I feel right now could have led me to suicide.  I know what it is.  I know it will pass.  I have people who support me, and I refuse to surrender.

I'm not going anywhere in particular with this post, just trying to serve another incentive to those going through those horrible first few days. Improvements in my concentration, motivation, sleep and general well-being have been so much faster than I was expecting.

To be honest, I am still not totally sure.  Bear with me for a moment, what I am about to say may sound shockingly familiar.

I started smoking in my late teens, pot I mean.  Back in highschool I was always anti drug.  Drugs seemed to be such a waste of time.  If I wanted to relax, all I had to do was crack a book or geek out on a videogame / film.  Life was awesome.  Drugs just seemed like such a drag and the people who used them seemed so unbalanced / immature.

Innocence is funny, when a person has it they want to defile it but once its gone, getting it back takes decades of active forgetting.  Anyway, an older nerd got my lan group into weed.  Pretty soon no one was gaming at lans, everyone would run out to hotbox a car and then they'd come back and look at videos or dick around on the internet.

All of this was annoying, and this older guy would just not stop abbout the benefits of weed. no withdrawal, not possible to be addicted, perfect drug, we have all heard these lines.  my young adult brain starts whirring.  i could just try weed once, then i would immeditaely quit and i could prove how lame this drug is.  

to say i was / am naive is an understatement.  I tried to research things as best I could, but back then no one had done any research on ""cannabis state dependence.""  What my friend didnt know, is that marijuana is almost worse than a pure physical addicion.  A person can have blood levels of some of the metabolites THC breaks down into for months after even a single hit.  These metabolites can result in reality feeling duller than it actually is.  The pothead. mistakenly thinks he is sober just because there is no thc in his blood, instead there are insane levels of 11-OH-THC, 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC, and a hundred others.

I am writing this post well over a decade later.  I am nearly 30 years old.  In between those unsure first steps with cannabis, and now, when I am throwing out over a half ounce, a bong, and a volcano, much has transpired.

This is not my first attempt to quit.  I can think of eight serious attempts and countless less effective tries.  I have quit for women and school and G.  I have quit to get better jobs or prove things to myself or for art.  These 8 attempts all lasted over a month, and the longest two attempts lasted over six months.

My friend was right about one thing - marijuana never ruined my life. I got through school, and now make bundles of money.  I am successful, happy, life is good.

So why am i quitting?

The biggest danger of marijuana use, aside from the false sober, is the longterm result of spending a decade playing dexters lab with one's brain.  I remember being a kid and not needing an excuse to feel good.

I have plenty of reasons to quit:

* Clarity
* Concentration / Focus
* Patience
* I am never sober, just high and less high
* Finances
* It runs out
* Sketchy people
* Disrupts natural ways of being happy and feeling good
* Consistency / Responsibility / accountability / reliability / maturity
* The cycle of high / sober shrinks my world via dependency - too much playing it safe
* Work performance
* Wrist hurt from grinding
* I always want to quit after i toke, its like weed itself is asking me to take things to the next level
* Its a lot of work / time to get high, get the stuff, grind, toke, smoking a couple bowls can easily take 30 mins to an hr
* Getting high is predictable and quite honestly boring.
* Simplicity - I did just fine before weed

I want to learn patience, to be able to work absorbed all day in something without also having to feed the beast.  When bad things happen, I want to meet them head on and wits about me.  When good things happen, I want to savor those feelings just as they are.  When I am lost in the doldrums aka the meat of life, I want to have the grace to smile and deal with the tedium constructively.  Mostly I just want to be myself, lucid, clearheaded, flaws, faults, and all.  Life is illusion enough as it is, no reason to further deceive myself.
 
I have a friend who has never even wanted to try any drug.  I asked him about this, he said ""I have never tried drugs because A) My mom did tons of drugs growing up and she would tell us stories of all the drugs she tried and they all sounded lame, and b) when I was in highschool I used to hangout with the stoners, and they were always bugging me to try. I started asking them ""is it the best thing in life?"" no one ever said it was so what am I missing out on? dry eyes and sore lungs?""

Anyway, time to throw somethings out.  Imma pull up a chair and hang around.

""My peers, lately, have found companionship through means of intoxication - it makes them sociable. I, however, cannot force myself to use drugs to cheat on my loneliness - it is all that I have - and when the drugs and alcohol dissipate, will be all that my peers have as well."" - Franz Kafka

And for the techies - someone asked on y combinator if mj helps with coding.  A few anons said maybe, but the #1 response:

Not me. I'm of the opinion that lighting things on fire and sticking them near your head to breathe just sounds like a bad idea all the way around.

I'm for legalization though. The idea of outlawing a weed that does less harm than alcohol is ludicrous.

I experimented a bit as a teenager. As I recall, it didn't help my analytical skills at all -- unless by analytical skills you mean finding doughnuts at 3am or being able to smile stupidly while listening to Led Zeppelin tunes.

I think intoxication is a natural state of mankind, so if you like toking or drinking or running until endorphins seep out of your ears I can understand that. I just don't think any of that, no matter how good it feels, actually makes you a better coder. If anything, I think good coders learn the natural rhythms of their bodies and minds, then maximize their performance based on that.

Now can it make you think you're a better coder? Sure thing, boss.

I started smoking when I was 16 or so, and smoked on the weekends and during the summer, but in my mid 20's it became a daily thing, until I preferred not to be sober.  During my descent, I was also in college, and maxing out my student loans and blowing it on stupid shit while not putting a great deal of effort into my education or thought as to where exactly I was headed.  

I'm now 60k in debt and have a generalized associates' of science to show for it.

Fortunately, my reality came check when I realized I was running out of student loans.  I certianly wished it would've come sooner, but I suppose for some people it never comes at all.

Anyway, I had to think long  and hard as to what I'm going to do for a living.  I realized none of my options included smoking pot every night.  I finally decided to work towards being a murse, and that's now my major.  I'm working every day now towards being more productive, making the right choices, and working towards the future.  I also quit smoking ciggarettes about a month after I stopped smoking trees.  I've gotten back into working out and I've even been jogging, but that's going to be slow progress as my lungs are going to need time to recover.

I think trees kind of fueled my own personal illusory reality, or what I like to call ""bubble.""  The worse things got in my life the more I'd to to trees and video games and whatever would provide the quick fix for my anxiety, rather than the solution.  I think without  something like trees to fuel my ego and personal unreality, I would've ""woken"" up at least a couple years earlier.

I've broken a lot of bad habits, and am forming some good ones, but the new ones aren't habit yet, so it's still tough going.  I notice without trees I don't overeat nearly as much, either.  It's hard to imagine just how many areas of my life I simply neglected while smoking all the time.

Good to see that there's other people that have has issues with trees!

1375401420.0,28,self.leaves,1jj4gc,40 days of freedom!! Here are some thoughts and feelings I have experienced,imalwaysdreaming,28,0,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1jj4gc/40_days_of_freedom_here_are_some_thoughts_and/,"1) I will be forever indebted to this sub. A big thank you to each and every one of you! If you need any help, advice, support or just some love - please message me.  
  
2) I couldn't have done it alone, and I will still continue to reach out to others about my addiction. When I was at my lowest since quitting (day 17), and wanted to start again I needed to talk out my feelings and confusion with people I love. If they weren't available (ie. 3am), I had you wonderful people to come to. Again, thank you.  
 
3) The biggest change I've noticed that my mind is more clear and I remember everything I need to now. No stopping mid sentence to say...""what was I talking about?!"" or forgetting my due dates at work. I make decisions easier and struggle much less with understanding what I am feeling.    
  
4) I still experience cravings, but it is so much easier to fight them. Almost like I have more ammunition now; the addiction doesn't have the same power it once had over me.  

5) When I started my daily habit 7 years ago I thought it helped me with my anxiety. Now that it is all out of my system my anxiety has reduced significantly. I don't think it was helping me at all with my anxiety (like some people suggest); it was making it worse because I was constantly worried about my consequences of using (getting arrested, hiding my habit from others, etc.).  

6) My worst days were day 15-20 (rather than the usual day 1-5), we all have a unique experience in quitting. For me day 15-20 I couldn't sleep and when I did I had nightmares, I couldn't eat, and overall I just felt off. But I stuck it out and by day 21 on I've felt amazing (more energy, better sleep, etc.).  
  
7) I have so much more time on my hands. I chose now to put my energy into running, yoga, art, cooking, reading, my relationships, and experimenting more with makeup (since I now have a lot more time before work every morning!). I am having so much fun discovering all of these new and exciting hobbies; many of which are making me look and feel better (the compliments from others helps to reinforce my decisions too).  

8) I wasn't addicted to weed, I was addicted to feeling numb. This was one of the hardest realizations I had. As my foggy mind cleared (day 21ish), my emotions were fragile. I see a psychiatrist who was very helpful for me in understanding and coping with the guilt, anger and sadness I have. It will be a process of healing, but I am confident I can do this too.  

9) I will never be rid of my addiction. I have control of it, yes...but I will most likely never be able to use weed or any other drug in a recreational way. I am not saying that is true for everyone, but I believe that it is probably true for the majority of addicts.  

10) I'm more proud of myself for quitting than I have been for anything else in my 30 years of life (more than my bitch of a degree, my wonderful job, my beautiful relationships - everything). I may have lost my relationship with weed, but I gained a lot of self respect out of that loss, and it is so worth it.  

*Here are some of the things that helped me best cope*  
- like I said above, trying out new hobbies  
- taking [melatonin pills](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003FWYY0C) for a short while to help with my sleep (day 17-25)  
- bubble baths and [breathing techniques](http://healthland.time.com/2012/10/08/6-breathing-exercises-to-relax-in-10-minutes-or-less/) to calm myself down if I was upset  
- healthy eating and taking a daily multi vitamin  

Hope this helps convince anyone on the fence :)

I had no idea this ""innocent plant"" had such a grip on me until recently... so many people's stories struck a chord with me that I thought I'd share mine as well.

I'm currently 26 years old but started smoking at 18 right before college. Damn, its been 8 years now. I discovered weed at a pivotal time in life; I came from a fairly sheltered upbringing, never drinking or trying drugs throughout highschool. Always did as I was told and made my parents proud. 

I was accepted to a fairly prestigious engineering college in a state university that also happened to be a famous party school. And party we did... but work always came first, and there was always a defined line between work and play (at first); us engineers would get our work done, pack it up, then crack open a case of beer and roll some J's. We worked hard and played hard and they were separate. At the time, I felt weed was aiding my life; it was a great way to de-stress and decompress, it was a great motivator to finish a project knowing I could smoke a celebratory bowl afterwards. I honestly thought my life had improved due to using marijuana. I told myself that maybe I had minor clinical depression, or ADHD, or anxiety issues, or was just plain naturally lazy, and my self-medication was keeping that all in check better than any prescription drug could ever hope to. 

Fast forward to graduation... I got a good job in my field, moved to a bigger city with some friends, and was starting my life. At age 22, my measure for success was if I could make enough money to pay all my bills and also drink all the booze / smoke all the weed I wanted. Within a year of working in my field, I realized that I hated it and could never see myself doing this my whole life... but it paid well, and it allowed me to reach my goals (pay my bills + drink/smoke all I wanted.) Every day I woke up with a feeling of impending doom to go to work; smoking a bowl took the edge off for the first couple hours, but generally I'd spend 9 miserable hours at the office, then jam as much THC and booze into my body as I could. I had a reputation as the resident party animal, always down for a drink or 10, and always had the hookup if someone needed green. I dated a girl for about a year who I realized I didnt really like, but she had sex with me, actively dating around was too much effort, and so I kept myself in a numbed state through most of our time together. She didn't even partake with me... it had become a defining factor of my being that I was always stoned, it was just a fact. After a very messy breakup, I totally let myself go; I'd smoke my chillum and sip a bottle of whisky on the way home from work, rocking a buzz before even stepping in my door. My musical ambitions turned from a passion into just something to pass the time then into a burden. Playing Xbox with my stoner buddies was just less effort. My friends who didn't smoke and drink alot became boring to me. For about a month and a half I got into cocaine, which made me realize just what an addictive personality I had. My friends still to this day say  that month I was doing blow was the strangest they'd ever seen me, like I was a different person. 

I think the sobriety is making me mushy, but it was somewhere in this timeframe that I met the most amazing girl I could imagine. Although she was younger than me, she had a higher level of maturity... she'd graduated from her party animal phase and knew the definition of the word ""moderation."" She's the first person I've ever met who inspires me to be a better person... it was only after meeting her that I realized there may be more to life than numbing out your brain.

We've been together for 1 and a half years now; I am purely a social drinker, and while I still enjoy partying on the occassional weekend, I no longer drink daily or to excess. I knew that my career was wrong for me for years, but never did anything about it; over the last 2 months I developed a business plan, found a partner who shares my vision, quit my job and am on the road of entrepreneurship. I finally wake up happy and with an ambition for success.

Which brings me to the topic of weed; starting a business is NOT easy, and in the last 3 weeks, I've found myself accomplishing less than I'd planned in a day, or making mistakes, or forgetting things, or letting calls go to voicemail, because I was high. Not going to the office, I'd take a hit or 2 before showering in the morning, maybe a bowl over lunch, then while coming down in the afternoon, hit another bowl and ""take a break"" for TV. By 5:00, I was so exhausted from being lightly stoned all day that all I wanted to do was chill and smoke weed just like when I was working in the office. I went to sleep thinking of all I wanted to accomplish the next day, but the next day repeated similarly to the last, and I was quickly growing discouraged.

It was yesterday that I realized I had to quit RIGHT NOW. I was doing some work across town and planned to meet my girlfriend afterwards... but realizing my house was on the way, I couldnt help but stop at home to get high. I ended up dicking around the house for 45 minutes (as tends to happen) and got to my girl's just as she was going to bed, as she had to work in the morning. I fell asleep realizing I was prioritizing weed over the love of my life and over the career I was building for myself... then got alittle more introspective, and realized I'd been putting my family on the backburner, fell out of my hobbies, and hadnt seen alot of my non-smoker friends in a damn long time. How many times had I used the excuse of being ""too busy"" because I was baked and accidentally watched 4 hours of Star Trek in a row? Or told my parents I wasn't able to visit because I was looking forward to a lazy Sunday of getting baked on the couch all day? 

I hate dwelling on the past and feel its a waste of time to regret... so today is the first day to right the wrongs of my past. Time to get my life on track, and get off this crutch I've been using for the last 8 years; actually the first 8 years of my adult life. I am not quitting FOR my girl; thats what makes her so amazing, being with her just makes me realize how much better I could be without always being under a debilitating influence. I'm really scared of how to handle stress and the realities of our world in the upcoming future, but I'm optimistic as well.... I haven't smoked a cigarette since April 9th, and weed has been a godsend for helping me quit... its actually causing me much more worry to quit weed than cigarettes. But if I could kick the nicotine habit, I can kick this too... although I did not expect the first day to be this difficult!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I, somewhat surprisingly, made it to that day without any real temptation to smoke and was lucky enough that after 10 or so years of multiple smoking per day had little trouble with it at all. I neglected to mention in my various postings here that I had always planned on smoking on May 25th with my best friend the night before his wedding. Its sort of a ritual and a plan we had always had that I didnt want to change, though he said it was no big deal if I opted not to. In the days leading up to it I wasnt sure I was going to join in - not because I was scared it would bring me back to my old ways, but simply because it didnt interest me. In the end I decided I would take a couple of hits off the joint and that is just what I did. When it came around to me I hit it twice and passed it, when it came again I took one hit, and then one more on the next pass. On the fourth pass I passed having had my fill and already starting to feel that familiar, yet now strangely foreign, feeling creep up. 

So, after 40 days of cold turkey what did that ""indulgence"" feel like? Well to be honest, it wasnt anything special. I didn't have any ""wow this feels so good"" or ""I have missed this so much"" feelings at all. I was high and thats it. The first hour or so was just that. Fast forward a little bit and I was dozing off watching the Spurs game when I wish I was able to pay more attention to it. Skip ahead a little and I woke up to my friends laughing and taking pictures of me as the game was going to overtime and I, like a stoner, was unable to stay awake for it. This led me to promptly get up give the middle finger in friendly joking manner and head to my hotel room to pass out for the night...and after browsing reddit in bed on my ipad for a solid hour I did just that. 

In the end I am not upset that I smoked. I actually think the only thing it did for me is remind me not of how much I used to love smoking, but rather how much I love not smoking. I hated being that guy who passed out watching tv. I now know more than ever that quitting was the right thing for me and I dont plan on smoking again any time soon even just for the ""fun"" of it like I thought I would. I'd rather stay awake and be social and get the most out of the time I spend with friends or be productive when I am alone. For those of you who have a  similar idea in mind of when you may try it again just to try it again I can tell you from experience: dont expect much. It aint better on the other side. This is where we belong. 

I know some people may say today is now my new day 3 but for me my count still continues. This is MY day 43. Good to still be here. 

TL;DR - Smoked with buddy night before his wedding, only made me realize I'm happy I quit.

I wanna thank all the people that helped support me in my original post. It did not go to waste. I am more determined than last time only because I can fully see the difference of sober me and high me. I do not like high me even tho sober me so so much more difficult.

After many many months of loneliness I almost had a reprise from it, but no. It didn't happen because I'm a pot smoker. Don't get me wrong, once I move to Washington I will plan to continue smoking, but being an Oklahoma smoker is getting old.

I mean, we all just sit around and smoke pot and watch TV. What the hell is up with that?

I just discovered you last night while looking for ways to successfully stop smoking marijuana. I've been smoking for over 5 years now and no matter how much I've convinced myself that it is not damaging my life and my life's direction, I admitted to myself last night (and multiple times before) that it has.

There have been times this year where I've burnt away an ounce of marijuana to myself in less than a month. That part of the habit doesn't bother me too much, but my desensitized outlook on everything else does. I no longer valued the bonds I had between family and friends. I stopped loving my girlfriend and would numb my mind when worries came up. Before I started smoking, I was the guy everyone was friends with and wanted to hang out with. My friend count has dwindled itself down to pretty much none. I kept telling myself that this is just what happens after college, but I think a sober me would have prevented that. I want to say ""sorry for spacing out for 5 years"" to my friends and family, but would feel ashamed and stupid.

There's a lot more I'd like to say about how (in the long-term of things) marijuana has truly put my life on a path I'd rather not have walked down for this long, but I need to start making changes now to get my mind off getting high. NOW.

The ironic thing is that I was/am a very creative and artistic person, so most people support my marijuana smoking and believe it has added fuel to my work, but to me, I miss what life has to offer.

Thanks for hearing me out, Leaves. Sorry for the erratic post. I really needed to vent and write to commit to my decision. I'm not too sure what I wanted to put here or get back from the thread, but if there are any tips to help me get through the first few days, that'd be awesome.

I couldn't have made it this far without you!

I know I am only two weeks in, but I am feeling much better, much less under the control of weed. The first few days were a bitch. I still live with smokers and that situation won't be changing. They have been semi supportive of me. They smoke around me but don't offer. In the very beginning I wanted to just give in and smoke with them, but I held strong. I have had more alcohol than usual, but not to an extreme. One drink when everyone is smoking so I don't feel completely left out. I plan to cut this out soon. I've never really been a drinker.

What has helped me and may help you if you are contemplating quitting:

- I gave away my smoking stuff. Pinch hitter to one roommate, pipe to the other. 

- I also gave away my stash to my roommates. 

- Picked up a hobby. I learned to shoot a gun for the first time at a gun range. (As a girl, I was really proud of myself for this and would never have done it if I were still smoking.) This is something I hope to do weekly. 

- Decided to knit everyone a Christmas present, so I've kept my mind and my hands busy when the cravings are bad. ( I know this won't help most of the guys out there. Sorry.)

-When cravings hit, I remind myself what day it is and not to give up and lose the time I've already put in. 

-Everyday I make a post it note with the day clean I'm on and put it on my monitor. When I feel weak I look at the number to gain strength. 

-Walking twice a day. Clears my head.

-Music. Listening to music sober is a new experience. Loving it. 

-Reading Leaves. I may not post a lot but just reading and knowing others are out there fighting this fight with me helps a lot. 

-Learning to cope with the anxiety in better ways. I downloaded some relaxation audiobooks and have been listening to them when needed. Not sure if they really help, but they do take my mind of the anxiety. 

If you are contemplating quitting or are struggling, you can do it. I know you can. I didn't think I could and now I am. You can too. I believe in you. 

If anyone wants a sober buddy, or needs someone to sound off to please PM me anytime. Support is a wonderful thing. 

Good luck to everyone, I'm rooting for us all.

From Jan-April I successfully went 90 days sober after good planning and commitment. In May I relapsed, and have been relapsing harder and harder up until now. 

This summer I threw away everything I struggled for during those 90 days. I attended Marijuana Anonymous, Meditated almost daily, Exercised consistently, Ate well, started seeing a therapist, went back to school, got an internship at a big company, started working on my social skills, was fulfilling court required classes, started picking up girls, meeting new people, all while getting over an EX and learning to manage a very destructive anger problem.

I jumped off the mountain I climbed just to fly rolling paper planes over cough syrup lakes, and drown in a stream of porn videos that ejaculated me back to my lonely bedroom. I blacked out the windows and opened a liquid-crystal's view into an endless illuminated world. Reality was just a dream as I rolled up my goals, inhaled pleasure, exhaled ambition, and ashed out any remaining sense of purpose. Wisdom texted me but I didn't feel like responding. 

I pulled out my lighter and sparked an idea that would burn away my self-built prison, and allow me to rise from the ashes. 

The paths of my mind are very worn and it will be painful to change them. Not only from smoking, but also a heavy gaming/porn/anger lifestyle as well. All of the triggers, emotional stuff, memories, anger, anxiety, depression, dullness, make this rough. It's like reprogramming myself to think differently, and that doesn't happen easy.

I need to wake up though and attend to my real dreams. I'm 24 but I've lost some very important years to this lifestyle, and I just keep making things worse. If anyone has tips for making the detox phase calmer that'd be cool. Looking forward to this! Cant be a lazy fuck anymore!

I can smoke everyday, and wake up feeling great. I hold a good job, a wife, and live a good life. Really, even after quitting, I look back and say ""I really didn't need to quit"". I am glad I did though, and I wanted to share how.

First off, I don't think my battle was any easier that anyone else's here. In fact, it may have been a little harder because it was always hard to find a solid reason to quit... So here's the simple, quick and dirty story of my trip with weed.

Smoked everyday...decided I wanted to quit...so I quit. relapse. quit. relapse. quit. relapse. quit. relapse. quit. relapse. QUIT. relapse. quit.

I think that most everyone can relate to this. So how am I clean now? It's actually pretty simple:

**Step 1:** I bought a silicone bracelet that has ""LeavesStrong"" written on it. I never had to explain what it was to anyone, because these things are so common now. Every time I'd think about weed, I'd look at the bracelet and remember that at some point I was so fed up that I bought a bracelet to remind me of how I felt.

(Addiction has a weird way of tricking you into forgetting why you quit...the bracelet is a constant reminder that your brain cannot ignore)

**Step 2:** Told all of my friends I'm not smoking anymore. I got a lot of the typical ""oh for the millionth time"" type of comments, to which I replied ""Yep"" and that was the end of it. They asked me to smoke for a few days after, but I refused and eventually they quit offering me and accepted that I was really quitting.

**Step 3:** Set a goal of not smoking ever again. In the past, I used to say ""I'll smoke again in a year, just on the weekends."" .. I'm sorry, but that is honestly a FAIL GOAL. You are setting up a date to work towards failing. Fuck that shit, don't do that.

**Step 4:** DON'T FUCKING SMOKE! Do not let your 'scumbag self' get in the way of your tiger blooded winning session. Doesnt matter if you have convinced yourself its a good idea, or your celebrating, just dont fucking smoke. 


That's it, follow this guide and you win. I told one of my friends this same advice and he is on day 30, and wears his bracelet everywhere.

It used to be just at night, then maybe once in the afternoon, then every morning, and now I smoke before everything I do.

Smoking has become so heavily engrained into my daily routine that, when I am in a situation where I can't smoke, it has become a problem. 

The main thing is my appetite. I feel like the only time I can eat, is after  I smoke. Leading me to not be able to eat any other time. If I try to eat and I haven't smoked, I can't even do it, all food just tastes wrong and I have to force myself to swallow. 

This summer I went on a weeklong vacation with my parents and I couldn't bring any bud. During the day I felt fine (and didn't eat a thing) but at night time I would get very sad, depressed, and anxious. It was a horrible week, and it showed me how much of a problem I really had.

What makes it even harder is that my parents are totally okay with me smoking. They weren't at first, but now it's gotten to the point where my dad has bought me bongs and regularly gives me money for weed. 

Plus, all my friends are regular smokers too, just not as much as me.

On top of it all, as much as I don't want to say it, it definitely effects my grades, but only because I live in dorms this year and I had constant stress on how I was going to keep up my smoking habit, leading to more smoking and less studying.  

**I want to quit**, or at least lighten up, only because of this strong dependence I have, **but I honestly don't know how.** I want to be able to go places, without thinking about how I'm going to bring weed with me to soothe my habit.

I used to get so stressed when it was time to leave for work. Did I unplug the hair iron? The real iron? Did the door lock behind me? Did I forget something in my bag? What a nut. So stressful. I could never leave and just leave. I'd always turn back to double and triple check things. At one point, I was convinced I might have real OCD. 

I don't. I was just stoned all the time. The combo of a bad memory, heightened paranoia (the apartment is going to burn down!!!), and heightened anxiety from smoking made this all horrible. 

My mornings are nothing like that anymore. I don't have OCD. I don't forget things. I turn back maybe one out of 10 trips out the door, not 10 out of 10. 

I still sometimes worry about leaving something unlocked or plugged in, but so many orders less than I used to.

I'll briefly state my life growing up as a child. I grew up in chaos, my family was extremely emotionally abusive to each other. The fights, in my mind, were always mundane and pointless and seemed to center around 'money' or the lack of mainly. I had a brother and I was the youngest child and only daughter. My family started moving us around when i was nine and we continued to move for years. In the end I have moved over 25 times in my life and have lived in 9 different states. Even though I love moving this has caused some issues in my life. I don't trust easy, I couldn't maintain friendships or relationships over 6 months, I could change who I was in an instant, and once I was gone I was no longer in contact with any one from my past.


We grew up poor, we should have been on food stamps but because of my mother I learned some *'life lessons'. 

1. If you ask for help you are weak.

2. If you accept help you are weak.

3. If you go to a therapist you are insane.

4. If you can't do it on your own, you are weak.*

Now don't get me wrong I love my mother to death, she just instilled in me some very hard things to break out of in the end. My child hood was crazy and chaotic, I love chaos, I jump into fights, I am EXTREMELY angry. That has been my biggest obstacle in my life is learning to get my anger out in a healthy way and not punch holes in walls or black out.


**My Use.**

I started by drinking at 14, it wasn't very much at first but it soon became more and more every day. By 15 I was blacking out and drinking every week around 5 times a week. I wouldn't come home to my family, I hung out with college kids because in my opinion high schoolers couldn't drink properly. My favorite drink was EverClear. I hated beer but still drank it. I loved hard liquor. I soon turned into the partier who would organize every party make sure people were bringing booze and everything else you needed to figure out. Towards the end of my drinking I could drink 13 shots in a night and not black out or throw up, I weighed 93 pounds.


 The last time I truly drank I drank 13 shots of hard liquor, got rouphied, snorted alot of molly, as well as cocaine for the first time in my life. I also drank an entire bottle to myself on top of it all. My lips were a dark blue and my body started to swell, I threw up over 50 times that night, and who knows why I woke up but I did, I'm grateful for that. I couldn't drink for a year because the smell of alcohol made me want to and sometimes vomit. 



When I was 16 my grandmother, who helped raise me as a child, had passed away at the age of 59 suddenly in her sleep. This started my love for smoking weed. I went from the occasional toker ever other week on the weekends. To everyday 5 times a day. This grew more every month to the point at the end of my use I was smoking 50 bowls a day, a couple joints and blunts, and gravity bong hits. As well as hash oil and other variations of that method of smoking. My family grew medical marijuana for 3 years and that didn't help my use much.The 5 years of my use I also used heavily adderal, ecstasy, molly, salvia, LSD, DMT, mushrooms, some designer drugs.



**Why I got sober**
 

 Then one fateful night the Feds came to my rave I was throwing and in the end I was caught with 43 pills of ecstasy. I was facing 5 years in prison and up to $25,000 in fines. I did everything in my power to not have that happen and I hired a $15,000 lawyer and he recommend that I go to rehab. So I did and I flew out to Minnesota to go to Hazelden for 30 days. Those 30 days turned into 3 months in treatment, because I didn't want to go home and become a stripper again. I had done it for a year and was tired of being disrespected because I put myself in that situation. I was afraid to go home because I would be living out of my car or living with people who still use. I stayed in treatment because I was scared shitless.  Then I did another 3 months in out patient treatment, and then living in a sober house. Which is where I still am today.



**Withdrawals**



I had withdrawals from marijuana and honestly they were pretty intense in my opinion. I was irritable, moody, and unpredictable. The littlest things would set me off. I couldn't eat for the first 2-3 weeks with out having horrible stomach pains and just feeling like shit. I had head aches and my sleep patterns were crazy. I was an insomniac because of withdrawals. I would wake up every morning the first month and cough up brown gunk! (I didn't smoke cigs.) My stool was hard but the color had turned bright fucking yellow, honestly, that one scared me alot. Through out my first two months my brain was releasing THC so there was at least one point a day the first month where I was literally high. Then the second month there was one point every week were I was high. I also was extremely sad and depressed and numb... I thought those would never go away


Due to the amount of LSD and DMT I smoked my vision is now changed, I see a black hazy 'flowery pattern' that moves on light surfaces. Lights at night are more blinding then before and I can't drive at night. I still see light trails and now I see in the sky or light and bright surfaces 'particle like movement' of dots that are just continuously there and moving. Its bee an entire year and I still see these things. In treatment I saw balls of light appear and fall from ceilings and then disappear in the floor, multiple times. It was a trip. Floors would move and sometimes they still do. I just have accepted it now.



**Why I stayed Sober**



Its not like I didn't have the opportunity to drink or use drugs even though I lived in a new city. One of the main reasons I stayed sober at the begining was because I had A LOT to lose, I still had 5 years in prison over my head. So at first that is what kept me sober. I was in a.a and went to a meeting everyday for the first 3 months out of treatment. that helped. Even though I had a huge amount of depression, mood swings, and numbness I kept trucking on. Knowing that if I were to smoke again or use again I would be blocking out even the smallest bit of happiness I could get. 


I say and hear people laughing in the meetings around me and in my sober house, I was angry at them because I didn't have that, I couldn't even feel. But the more I stayed the more I changed my behaviors and stepped out of my comfort zone and let people in to help me and learned to accept their help. I learned that it's okay to walk away from situations that make me angry, to ask for help, and to let people in. That it is okay to let someone go and do what you need to for yourself. I learned to say no. But mostly I learned that happiness can and will be reached the longer I am sober.



I still have my bad days and rough spots but over all I'm a happier, easy going person, who values them self. My legal problems went from 5 years in prison and $25,000 to a year and a half on probation and less then $500 in fines. Those will be expunged off my record after probation and I wont be looking at a felony. 



Getting sober is the easy part, staying sober through life when shit gets rough is the hard part. But you learn to deal and it pays off. It paid off for me and I'm so happy today. Even if I am sad I still have a small appreciation because now I know the feeling.. now I know that I can feel every range of emotion instead of blocking out everything. Which means I will be happy soon enough. 



I've been through so much in my past and I'm grateful for everything that has gotten me to where I'm at today.

The day before I smoked what was supposedly my last joint. As I was walking to the place where we would meet (a café) I was telling myself over and over again ""You'll give him the money, chit chat a bit and walk away"". Got in, started drinking lots of white wine. He was already drunk from beer. We then went outside because he wanted to smoke a joint. I went with him. As I was giving him the money a voice that wasn't me asked ""Can I have some more?"". It's almost like if after I asked that I immediately felt like saying ""Wait, no, no, no, no... nevermind! Don't give me more!"" but I didn't say anything. He gave me more 20€ of hash. I didn't have the money so I told him I'll give it later. Went home. Smoked a joint. You know that feeling you get when you're high, you know you shouldn't be but you're too numb to take any action? Out of nowhere, I started crying. I guess the wine helped with the release of emotions. I felt helpless, a prisioner of my incapacity to think long-term. I understood the depths of my addiction in that moment, I realized my convictions are meaningless when faced with tempation. I had to take action. So I broke the hash into little pieces and threw it all to the gutter. Literally to the open sewer. So now I have no hash and I still have to give 20€ to my dealer. Next time, I know what to do. Get in there, say hi, give him the money and fuck off outta there.

I think I'm struggling to quit, but I might just be, I don't know, not even really trying. I hope you don't mind, but I'd like to share part of my life story with you right now. Maybe we can work together on this for a minute, I guess, tell me what you think.

When I was a teenager, I tried every drug that was offered to me. I stopped doing that after I left high school, but while I was there it was like I had a sign on my forehead that said, ""Drugs, please."" or something, because people just wanted to give me free drugs. I moved every year because of my mom's habit of moving every year. I think the lack of friends and an unstable home environment lead to me wanting to fit in and I just went along with whatever anyone suggested. That and I think a lot of the kids that gave me the drugs just wanted someone to get high with. Once they learned I was down for anything, they'd come find me when they wanted a drug-buddy. I was a risk taker, daring, ready for adventure, nothing to lose. 

Well, my mom didn't want me around and put me away when I was 15. I stayed away, living in programs and foster homes until I ran away when I was 17. I've been homeless on and off ever since. Squatting, living with friends, renting apartments when I have a job. 

I dropped out of high school when I was 17. Since dropping out, I've stopped almost all drug use entirely. There were significantly fewer offers and I didn't want to seek it out, plus I recognized how stupid it was. I even stopped drinking alcohol entirely, but I've kept smoking weed. I don't know why I've kept smoking weed, it isn't necessarily a good thing for me and sometimes I feel like it's bad. I'll smoke a hit off any bowl or joint offered to me. I don't usually smoke a lot in one sitting, but I have my own one-hitter and on days off I'll smoke one every two hours or so. I also smoke every day after work.  I don't smoke a lot at once, but I smoke every day. 

I spent all day yesterday hanging out with my awesome boyfriend. He doesn't smoke like I do. He never did drugs and only ever started drinking and smoking weed when he got to college, and he only does it on weekends with his friends. We don't do it together unless we're hanging out in a crowd at a party. I didn't smoke yesterday, didn't even think about it until I realized it this morning, and I felt really good about that fact. However, I've already smoked today and I know I'll end up in the same pattern all day.

I think it's the monotony of that pattern that I'd really like to get away from. It's boring, it's a symptom of being bored, I think. I'm just feeling bored and somewhat depressed in general as a person, even though things are going well for me now, therefore I smoke weed? That's my hypothesis. I have lots of interesting hobbies, but to be honest, I'm bored with my life. I don't have any money, I'm not passionate about my job, I never went to school after I dropped out. I am an artist and musician and I do shows and gigs occasionally and some of the cool kids like my work, but I feel like I'm plateauing. I feel sort of stagnant. Maybe I should read more books, and I wish I never heard of Reddit. 

I think I'll be happier and less bored if I quit smoking weed every day. Perhaps I've got my cause and effect backwards, but that's what I think. Maybe if I wasn't so bored I wouldn't smoke. I hope I'm not settling for being a mediocre character, but sometime I feel like I just don't have it in me anymore. I mean my art and music. I look back at what I've done, especially the last 5 years, and I'm impressed with my work. It just feels like I'm not that person any more. I want to be, because that person is super cool, but I'm just not. I'm more ""mature"", quieter inside, calmer. My new work reflects that. I'm plateauing and I know it and it sort of depresses me. I feel like maybe I shouldn't give up, that I'll get another wind if I just keep sailing, but I don't know. I feel like part of me has already given up trying to be who I was. I guess I just recognize the fact that everything has changed, not just myself. There were a lot of contributing factors that went into the events that happened in the past, and those factors aren't what they used to be. 

*TL;DR:* But I still smoke weed, and I feel like it just contributes to this stagnating feeling I have.

edit: I just want to add that a dime bag will last me almost two weeks, in case you're curious.

First, let me say that I hope this is the right place to post. I went to /r/trees first, but it wasn't particularly enlightening. If this is the wrong place, please feel free to tell me so and I will remove this post. 

So I am giving up weed. I am re-entering the job market and don't want to lose any opportunities due to testing positive in a drug test. I'm currently in consideration for a position in the state government and am waiting to take my competency test, which I assume will be accompanied or followed by a drug a test. I have been a daily smoker for a couple of years, although (un)fortunately the only weed available where I live was usually dirt weed. I still have time to detox as I'm not expecting the competency test for another 2-3 weeks or more.

So my first question. If I quit today, how long until I am detoxed? I am about 5'7 and 160lbs, so a couple of lbs overweight, but not too much. Also, I have heard that detoxing can make you irritable and slows down learning---I don't really want to go in for the job test irate and unable to learn new functions, anyway to counter this, or is it a mind-over-matter situation? 

Does the quality of weed affect my THC levels? Basically, does detox happen quicker since I smoked dirt weed?

I naturally drink lots of fluids and almost always have a glass/bottle of water with me, I have heard that cranberry juice is very detoxifying and I will grab some tomorrow....any advice on managing fluids?

Are there any dietary tips? Any foods that help/hinder with detoxing? Any vitamins or supplements that help?  

Any advice on dealing with withdrawals and cravings? I feel rather anxious and slightly uncomfortable....is that normal? I've also been smoking **a lot** more cigs today, which I hope is only temporary. Any advice from cig smokers?   

I just want to be clear that I am asking you guys this because I want to beat weed, not just a drug test.

I began a few times, but felt a real hesitation when it really came down to it, and I ended up using up most of my remaining brain cells this weekend sorting out why. The result is that I've decided that we will neither now, nor ever, implement badges.

I'll try to make my reasons as clear as I can:

* 
I believe in, and have advocated, counting days as part of quitting, but counting days is only a small part of what should be a *balanced* approach to life change.  It shouldn't be elevated to center stage.

* 
We are an egalitarian community and I want to keep us that way.  I liked, and may have been a bit seduced by the idea of all my posts being tagged Subduction(4923), but people in our community should be judged by their contribution, nothing else. Wisdom can come from people at every point on this road and one poster should not be considered differently from another.

* 
Counting days is something you do *for yourself.* If you ruin that achievement it should be you facing you, not some public humiliation or external motivation.

* 
Maintaining the ""prestige"" of a high badge number is a motivation to lie about a relapse -- lying, to others or ourselves, is a cornerstone of an out-of-control habit.  We don't need more temptations.

So I strongly encourage you to count days. Talk about them -- post and tell us where you are on your road to quitting.  But at the end of the day you should be counting them by yourself, crossing them off on a calendar specifically because this is just a promise between you and yourself, no one else.

Again, I'm sorry for promising something and then changing my mind, and I realize that they would be fun, but I think this is the best decision.

I'm just like every one of you. I've ""quit"". I've kept telling myself that I need to get my act together. I don't have money for this shit. I've been telling myself ""Today is the last day. After you smoke all of your stash, you won't hit up your dealer anymore."" I've been mad at myself while high and when I'm not high, I've reach for my piece over and over again.

This time is different. This time I didn't quit because of any reasons. I didn't quit because I didn't have money. I didn't quit because my life isn't working out. If you have reasons to quit, you tend to find a way around those reasons. Oh I can save up here and there. Oh well I'm in transition so there's nothing I can do to change my life..etc. 

The reason I quit is because dammit. I want to fucking quit. Nothing and nobody has a hold over me than my own free will. I'm strong enough to get past this and I'm strong enough to not be a slave to sativas and indicas. I'm strong enough to decide what I want to do with my life and if that means not smoking, I'm strong enough to do that too. I don't need a reason. I'm quitting because I am quitting. It's no longer fun. It's a coping mechanism. It's a way for me to stay in my own head and create drama for myself. I'm quitting because weed isn't the only good thing in my life. And I've made it just that. I'm quitting because there are bigger and better things out there for me.

I know I'm not quitting forever. I just can't do this daily routine. I have to smoke before I can enjoy any activity. That feels so fucking wrong. It's been 3 days and let me tell you what a relief it's been for me. I'm thinking clearly. I'm sleeping/waking up better and less groggy. I have so much more energy to live life and enjoy life and love life. I couldn't do that with the monkey on my back. I went to my friend's/dealer's house today and I sat and just hung out with my friend. Not because he has bud. Not because he'll smoke me out. Just because he's my friend. This is my journey.

1294526245.0,27,self.leaves,eyo3z,"Addiction, from a Psych Major",Stiffler5336,35,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/eyo3z/addiction_from_a_psych_major/,"I've browsed /r/trees for awhile now, because I am an avid cannabis user. I've seen a lot of different things on addiction, since it seems to be the 'buzzword' and a very strong argument that people against drugs use.
I wanted to come here, while this subreddit is new and put up a good description of what addiction is.
I'd like to state before I start that I am not an expert or a specialist by any means, I am a 4th year Psychology major that specifically studies neuropsychology, so my basis is in the biology of the brain. 

For repition I'll say again that I am not a specialist or anything and this isn't taken from a textbook, this is merely my view of addiction from the point of view of a psychology student.

In my opinion there are two different types of addiction, physical and mental. Here is an example of each: 

Physical can be described as a patient in the hospital on pain medication. Pain medication infiltrates the brain and works on the chemical messengers in the brain, changing the messengers in order to get the desired effect. However, the brain is amazingly adaptive and realizes that this is happening, so when the pain killer is continually prescribed the brain eventually 'depends' on getting the certain neurotransmitter effect, and stops producing it's regular chemical messengers in the brain. So when the patient stops taking the prescribed pain killer their brain is now abnormal in that it isn't producing all the neurotransmitters it needs to be fully functional, resulting in withdrawal. 

Mental is the second method of addiction and is extremeley less dangerous. My best example of mental addiction is World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft doesn't change your brain, it doesn't directly influence any chemicals in your brain, it simply is fun. Yet many people still say WoW is addictive, and I'd have to agree that it is mentally addictive. Playing WoW grants joy, and as such when a person is doing something less fun than the amount of fun they perceive playing WoW will give them they long to play the game, becuase what they are really intereseted in is just having the best time.

If you agree with how I've defined the two types of addiction you can make your own assumption about cannabis, however I'll also explain my thoughts on cannabis and its level of addiction.

Cannabis is both mentally and physically addicting. I'd like to tackle the physical aspect first, becuase I believe a lot of pro-cannabis users will immediately disagree. However, cannabis, as in my example of physical addiction, has a direct effect on the brain and does change the neurotransmitters in the brain. However, the withdrawal symptoms of cannabis are very minor, a small headache, maybe a loss of appetite, but nothing that serious and easily faced and beaten. 
Next is the mental addiction of cannabis, I believe that this is ~90% of the actual addiction to cannabis that causes people to continually do the drug. Just like in World of Warcraft cannabis is extemely fun, and like I stated before anything that is fun and gives joy makes one want to do it again. Our inability to deny pleasure is, in my opinion, the majority reason people become 'addicted' to cannabis.

I have been smoking since my senior year in high school which accumulates to about 8 years of smoking. I have been smoking consistently throughout and since that time buying an 8th every 2-3 days.

So today, I decided to pick up a decent size sack, a half oz., and just live my life like I have been...half assing finding a job, and smoking to forget real life problems. As I was on my way to follow my weekly routine and pick up to smoke, I was in my car looking for my wallet, and of course like the title says..it wasn't there.

I had a total of about $170 in there with all my credit cards including my drivers license. Now, to be honest, I was severely frustrated with losing this much money and my cards, but instead of mere frustration, disappointment and guilt was engulfing my body to the point where I realized this incident is what's going to push me to quit.
Why this particular incident? I have no idea. But, this particular wallet losing incident made me realize how much of a disappointment I have become not only to myself, but to all the important people around me. Ever since I could remember, I was quite the extrovert; making friends wherever I went, and being the ""life of the party"" at most events I attended. I always exuded confidence wherever I was and actually ENJOYED being that guy. Whenever my friends and I participated in sports or games or an type of competition I always had this thirst to be the best. I was so passionate in everything I did regardless of the situation or what we were doing. ..Then... I found weed.

I cruised through my university with a bare minimum GPA and graduated after 4 1/2 years. While attending, I worked for 2 Fortune 500 companies (one being an internship), but nothing excruciating enough to make me want to or need to quit bud. I always told myself that this was just a phase, and I would ween off my smoking, but it came to a point where I couldn't even last one full day without craving that hit..The worst part about this is that all my friends were in the same boat as me, but we were all satisfied with what how we were living our lives.

We would meet up EVERY SINGLE DAY to smoke, and smoke for the WHOLE day. Before class, after class, before a movie, after a movie, before eating, after eating, basically ANY available open time we had. So, fast forward a little bit and now one of my friends moved on to take care of his family business (received his degree), another is waiting tables still trying to complete his degree, another dropped out of college and now works at a best buy, etc. etc.
After college, I realized that by staying with this circle of friends I was constantly hurting myself and my future, so I left my group of friends. I thought this was the best idea in the world for myself, and for 2 weeks I actually quit. But then I went directly back after those 2 weeks, and haven't stopped since...the worst part about this is that in the past I used to smoke all day everyday with my friends, but now I was smoking all day everyday ALONE. I was not going out, I was staying home all day, just smoking and doing nothing at all productive. I was supporting myself with whatever money I had made throughout my previous jobs, including support from my parents, and some financial support from my sister who had just completed grad school, had ALREADY paid off her loans, and got a new 6 FIGURE job....

So pressure was mounting on me because I could never be as successful as my sister had become and I didn't really have anybody to talk to, and smoking would just erase that pressure.. This cycle went on for a long time and I was doing nothing about it. I would tell myself everyday that I was digging myself into a deeper hole and that I need to stop NOW. But, as most if not all of you know, this is so much fucking easier said than done. I just kept smoking and time literally flew by, and now I'm 25, lacking confidence, jobless, and trying to quit weed... god I seriously disgust myself.

While my family was using their hard-earned money to pay for the home mortgage, daily/monthly expenses, here I was being a useless pathetic piece of shit. By losing my wallet today, it reminded me where all my cash was actually going. This was almost a blessing in disguise because I realized how much of my time and money went into this plant. Not only time and money, but my passion had diminished, and my craving to be the best was not there anymore. I used to be proud of who I was, but now I go into the public feeling ashamed of who I am.

I've become the person that I always found most pitiful. I've become the person that I never envisioned myself to be. I genuinely don't know if this post is even comprehensive or if it even has a point. I just wrote this to tell myself this. I don't want to stay this weak loser that I've become.

Again. For the third time. Last time I quit was 6 months.

Every, single, time I start feeling better (no anxiety, irrational thoughts) I think ""well, maybe I cured my anxiety through my own will and weed wasn't the culprit. I'm sane now. I can go back to smoking""


So I start smoking again. At first it's all cool. ""Nice! I knew I could handle weed. No anxiety and I've been smoking for a week. This is great!"" but after a few weeks I start noticing the thoughts come back. The irrational fear that I can't pin down to a particular thought. The constant anxiety of an uncertain future. Worrying about nothing, other than the worry itself.

I tell myself I need to get my head straight and fix it, just like last time. I tell myself it can't be the weed, since I was fine smoking it just last week. This anxiety must be under my control, the weed has nothing to do with it.

The thoughts seem to be real logical paradoxes. I try to tackle one, sometimes I succeed. ""Ah yes! Of course I shouldn't worry about this. Duh!"" Then a second later I find a flaw in the solution. Or another logical paradox pops into my mind. I know they're the source of my anxiety and by giving them the attention I'm fueling their importance. But my brain doesn't seem to understand this.


Then things get so bad (these past few days) where I can't even enjoy the present moment at all. Imagine all the mental energy we use to experience the world. 95% of it is wasted fueling anxiety. 5% I have left to live life. I *know* it's the weed... yet I don't at the same time.


When I'm clean and cured I think ""how stupid I was to be worried all the time! I could've controlled it myself... it's so simple! Just... don't worry!"" When I'm a stoner though, I know it's not true.


Thanks for reading. I appreciate any replies. It feels good to write this down. Communicate it with someone. I can't get myself to tell anyone I know about this. I sound insane.

I can't believe im actually at day 94 of not smoking. After smoking almost every day from age 15 to age 24 this is the biggest change i've ever been thorugh in my life. I still get cravings at least a few times a week but every time I resist I still feel like I've accomplished something. Don't get me wrong, its hard as shit. When I walk into my sisters room and see a bowl packed in her bong, or when I go to a party and everyones lighting up. Holy shit it's difficult to not smoke. 

Even though its hard, I resist. I know it's not what I need right now. I know that i'm better off without it in my life. I know that I am a more productive, motivated, engaging, active person when i'm not high all the time. I know that weed makes me more complacent with where I am and I use it as an escape mechanism. It is okay that i've used it in the past, but not anymore. I'm committed to my change. I'm committed to becoming the person I want to be and weed has no place in my life anymore. That's okay, because I don't need it anymore. I want it, but I don't need it. I can handle anything life throws at me and I dont need to escape it with a bowl. Time heals all wounds.

I use weed to distract myself from the parts of my life I don't like. I hated my job but didn't have motivation to find a new one or change anything because I could always just get stoned and forget about it.

I realized that, as an addict, I am not capable of moderating myself if I have weed around me. It wasn't until now that I understood an extremely fundamental truth for people who suffer from addiction: **you never stop being an addict**; staying clean is a lifelong undertaking. If you're truly addicted, you can never partake in it again, not even once or in a tiny amount. No weaning, no cheating. The moment you give in to that little voice telling you it's been long enough, that you've now got your addiction under control, it'll be too late.

This year I enter Lent without having touched weed in 225 days.  Thanks to all of that have helped me along the way.

My Life Story of Addiction (LONG!).",OneLastChance4,30,5,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/172mo6/two_days_its_a_start_my_life_story_of_addiction/,"I am using a throwaway account as I am disclosing a lot of information here. I am glad I found this subreddit, reading the hardships others are experiencing and their success with continued cessation of smoking is really encouraging. I've been on the fence several times with posting my story, but I think letting it all out would ultimately be good for me.

I grew up in a ""Christian"" home, my parents attended a southern Baptist church, and I was forced to go as well, up until around 16 or 17 when my part-time job got me out of going. I stopped believing in god as a youth because of all the social injustice I witnessed in the world, among many other things. I had a few close friends from the church up until college, but needless to say I was very ""sheltered"" in highschool. 

I didn't attend any parties, I never drank or smoked, I mostly stayed cooped in my room with video games and programming. My freshman year of college was great, I was more of a social butterfly after hitting the gym and getting my body in the best shape of my life. I made more friends, still never drank/smoked/partied. I had a 4.0 GPA going home for summer break after my first year. 

I started hanging out with a girl I had talked to in highschool some, we hung out a lot with another friend at his house and this is where I tried weed for the first time. I thought my experience was simply amazing, and continued to chief a few more times that week.
The girl I mentioned is now my wife, it was a summer of love for us and we became as care-free as the open breeze, driving around late at night, listening to music, and smoking pot. 

When it came time to go back to school in the Fall, we continued dating even though we attended different universities (about 100 miles apart). I would go visit her every weekend, and she was able to secure way better pot than we were used to (shwag). Blue dream, lemon skunk, etc. We would get high as a kite all weekend, and had some truly amazing experiences. We couldn't stand the distance any longer, so I transferred to her school the next Spring and we moved into our first apartment together. 
We started smoking every day, every chance we got. I couldn't go to class unless I took a few bong rips first. I started eating horribly, hadn't worked out since the past summer, and my GPA plummeted. I really didn't give a shit about much else but getting high. 

We got married at a court house during this time also. After the semester was over and we both did horribly, I decided we should move back to my previous school's city and go from there. I was in a position to graduate before her and get a job so she could go back. She agreed and we moved. I worked as a computer lab assistant and continued my education, this was now my Junior year. I found a new connection, and would often leave my job early to go snag pot because it was really lax. It increasingly became apparent that I needed to be high all the time to function, or so I thought. My wife would plead with me to cut back, we have to pay bills, etc. I turned a blind eye.

She was able to quit any time, she could go months, etc. and it didn't phase her one bit. I couldn't understand that. I eventually got fired from my computer lab job for being irresponsible and not there for all of my shifts. I went to a local pizza place to see if they were hiring delivery jobs (of course they were). I filled out an application and I was on the road slingin' pies within a few days. 

This is the juncture of my life were I jumped off the cliff of any remotely responsible resemblance of a mature adult. I met a lot of new people - many who also enjoyed smoking herb. This was the most laid back place I have ever worked. The manager smoked bowls behind the store every few hours, there were beers in the walk-in cooler, lots of guys smoked on every delivery. I delivered late at night in a college town, so every shift seemed like one big party. I should note I NEVER drank up until this point in my life. I started having a few beers here and there, people would offer me shots and bong rips at parties, it hardly felt like ""working"". 

The next few years, sadly, became a blur. I started drinking a four loko for every shift, drink more when I got off, and smoke the whole time as well. I'd wake up hungover and feeling like shit, and I would hit the bong to nurse that. I'm so lucky my wife never left me during all of this, maybe she should have. She has always loved me with all her heart, and she knows I have great potential. 

What should have taken me one more year to finish college took me three. I recently graduated last semester, with a degree in CS. My school work and projects always became second place to booze and weed. There are plenty of alcoholics on both sides of my family, and I never realized I had such an addictive personalty. I could never have one or two beers, I had to have the 12 pack. A few tokes of weed was never enough, I needed to rip huge bong bowls worth. I have tried several times to quit smoking and drinking, but I've always failed.

I am 26 now, my wife and I have a seven month old son, and I still can't get my shit together. My wife is truly fed up with my bad choices, I was very close to having to pack up my shit and find another place to leave until I sort out my life. The thought of losing my son made something snap in my brain, and I've never been so committed to quitting. For the first time ever, I boxed up everything I had (vaporizers, bowls, papers, jars, grinders) and sold it all. I last smoked on Sunday morning (scraped resin) before I cleaned all my stuff and boxed it up. I've also weened myself slowly off alcohol (only had 4 drinks worth last night - an amazing feat for me). I'm ready to give that up completely now as well. 

I've been trying to work out all I can, and be productive. I feel like I don't know who I am anymore. I've hurt so many people in my life along the way, sometimes I just sit and reflect on what I've done and burst into tears. For the longest time I was in denial about being an addict, I didn't want to be labeled that the rest of my life. I constantly thought about the fun times I'd be missing, all the social drinking events, drinking during sports outings, hitting the bong, etc. I know realize the best life for me and my family can not include alcohol and pot. 

I thought for the longest time, nobody can get addicted to pot, it's just a plant that has never killed anyone, and I surrounded myself with musings of those found in r/trees. Denial came easy. I've been smoking for seven years, drinking for five years, and I've wasted so much of my life just being a zombie on the couch. I've never quit for longer than a few days. 

I am now on the job hunt for programming jobs, my senior project involved developing an Android application that I hope to publish to the play store soon. There are so many things I could do right now to better my life, but every now and again my brain goes ""when is the next bowl brah?"". I have crazy mood swings, anxiety, nightmares, sweating. I'm determined to make it over the hump this time and stay strong. Thank you so much for reading my story r/leaves, any encouragement is always appreciated!

I don't know myself not high, with the exception of several 1-week-long vacations. Usually during these vacations, I'm nauseous for the first few days, and by the end I'm happy, clear-headed, and determined to continue not smoking when I return home. But once I have access again.... no willpower and back to waking, baking and staying high all day. With the exception of these vacations, I've smoked trees all day every day for these nine years. i've somehow managed to do this and attend grad school, line up a great job for after graduation next year, and have happy and fulfilling relationships with my boyfriend, friends and family. Other than my boyfriend (who doesn't smoke), best friends, and a couple of my boyfriend's friends, no one in my life knows I smoke. Not sure how I've pulled this off. If anyone I knew found out, they would be shocked, or actually probably just wouldn't believe it.

I keep hearing redditors on r/leaves say they've gotten sick of smoking. I wish I would get sick of it. I love it. I truly do. It makes me happy. It balances me. But it's not sustainable. It's not good for my health. I worry about getting cancer, even though I'm young and healthy (other than the smoking...). I worry I'll have kids in a few years and they'll have defects because of my smoking. I hate planning my social interactions around making sure I get to smoke so I'll WANT to have social interactions. I hate thinking about how much money I'm wasting on two ounces a month.

I've tried quitting. I just can't. Every year, quitting gets harder. I've watched my college friends and stoner friends fade out of the lifestyle, but I hold on. I've researched how to quit trees a lot, and r/leaves. The advice all seems pertinent and helpful. Don't think about quitting. Think about getting through a day. Don't quit; replace it with other activities. Exercise. I like it all. I still don't think I'll be able to quit. I don't have the willpower. 

I feel like I have a good opportunity to quit. My friend/hook is moving out of the country for a year for a job. i have enough to last me for a couple more days, and even though he'll be around for another month, I feel like if I need to try to quit now. This weekend. When my current stash runs out.

I'm not sure how anyone can help. I need willpower I lack. But redditors, you never cease to amaze me, so I've gathered the courage to put this out there and ask for your words of wisdom or success stories from anyone who has quit after being in so damn deep.

This is where I ended up. A year ago Subduction suggested I attend, so I went. Was he right? Did I belong here? I'm 20 years younger than everyone here, they all have far worse problems then myself (homeless, ill, etc), and I hate waking up early. Atleast it's under my parents insurance so I'm not the one paying for it. 

I just smoke weed. Sure I find myself less sharp, but what I lose in preciseness I make up for in creativity and relaxation. 

After a week, one of the nurses told me I was in the 'pre-contemplative' stage, I wasn't ready to quit yet. I knew it wasn't good for me, but I wasn't ready to give it up. What did she know, I can't even remember how long I've wanted to quit. Just add rehab as another place I don't feel welcome. So I smoked that day. And the next.

Fast forward to today, my parents lost their job so I am no longer covered by their insurance. No problem, I have money saved up, I'll apply for my own insurance. 

I'm young, I've never been sick, and I eat healthy. But on the application they ask if you've attended any drug rehabilitation clinics. Not a good place to lie, since I hear health insurance companies are looking for reasons not to pay out if they need to, and I'm sure they have medical records, so I told the truth.

Application one, rejected. 

Second application, rejected. 

I guess I'm 'high risk'?

I resented my whole 1 week I spent in outpatient rehab, but I did learn one thing from one of the doctors. Play the tape through in your mind. If you take one, what's going to happen next? It's different for everyone. For me, I'll come down and want another one. Oh and the next morning after smoking so much, just a little in the morning to get rid of that 'weed hangover'. And another. And a year has passed, and I'm in the same spot I was before.

If I start again, my rational mind will be impaired and I don't know when I'll stop. 

Maybe I am out of shape, uninsurable, unemployed. But no rehab, higher power, or counselor kept me sober today. I kept myself sober today. 

And I'll take that $150/month I'm saving on health insurance to join a gym, eat more vegetables, and buy educational material regarding addiction.

I don't know where I'm going with this, I just felt like getting this off my chest. I hope the greed of the healthcare industry doesn't last.

Weed had been my best buddy for 33 years since I was 15.  My partner of 28 years was highly opposed to it all along and I was always sneaking around behind his back.  I would inevitably get caught and swear it was over and then go right back to it. 

I have lost jobs over weed.  Ironically I was clean for 3 weeks when I had to take a drug screen last week and now I am on a furlough since I flunked.  My manager values me or else I would have been canned outright.  

I don't want to think of how much I have spent directly on pot, plus the indirect costs of driving around to get it and whatever impact it has had on my health.  

I was arrested for hash in college and still was too dumb to quit then.  Oh the trouble I would have saved myself.  

Every other time I have quit, I have always known that I would go back at some point.   This time I feel differently.  Maybe my love affair has run its course.   

Since I have quit, I have gone through much of what others on here have talked about: anxiety, sleep disruption, anxiety, irritability, and oh yeah, did I mention anxiety? 

One of my major high habits was eating like it was going out of style.  I had started to control that a month or so before quitting and so far I have lost 25 lbs since the beginning of June.  I have about another 25 to get back down to where my BMI no longer says ""obese.""   More irony, I think that the weight loss is what caused me to flunk my drug screen.   Since THC metabolites are stored in fat and I am burning that fat, I assume that I have released those chemicals back into my blood stream for elimination.   

I am going to pay for a professional test tomorrow, my 4 week mark, to see if it out of my system yet or not.  I had tried a home test from Rite Aid a week before my work test and it said I was negative. So a big FU to the maker of that test.

For me personally, this means not hanging out with my old friends right now, painful as that is.  I just don't want to lose these hard-won 80 days, you know?

*For me personally*, MA meetings made my sobriety possible, having that support and unconditional love from my new MA friends.  Cause my old friends haven't been calling me, that's for damn sure.  C'est la vie, I'm moving on.

Detoxing from marijuana was really rough for me; I didn't start to feel halfway normal until about day 45 or so.  Hang in there, it's rough as hell, but it gets better.  The rebound anxiety, the sleeplessness, the anger, rage, and irritability--it all gets better with time.  

I'm also really grateful for /r/leaves, reading your experiences and feeling that common bond with y'all has really helped me on this journey.

I don't have too much to say. I feel like I'm starting to settle into life as a non-smoker. However, I'll be facing the most peer pressure to smoke once Summer starts for me in June. This is because I told everyone I took a break to do well in school. Hopefully by June, I'll be able to firmly say no to my friends.

Quitting has had some great benefits. I can really feel the difference in how clear my mind is. I've saved a ton of money. I picked up a new hobby (shoutout to r/homebrewing). I no longer have to watch out for the police, they are only here to help now (except maybe when I'm speeding, haha). My performance in classes has noticeably improved and I have a new found interest in my studies. 

Some things I've learned:

* Cravings are temporary. Understand this implication, because it means you don't have to give into them.

* Keep yourself busy. However, be careful not to overwhelm yourself. I took on too many obligations at the onset. I'm relearning how to balance my life.

* Always think about why you *want* to quit not why you *have* to quit. There is a big difference. Learn that difference and you will find your true motivations.

* It gets easier. I no longer have withdrawal symptoms and cravings are few and far between. Stay strong. It will be worth it, I promise you.

I just want to thank you all again for the support.  I hope to continue offering my own advice when I think I can help.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_rt64t,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rt64t/100_days/,
1332271935.0,27,self.leaves,r5if5,Seven days: a status update,,27,0,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/r5if5/seven_days_a_status_update/,"Hello there, fellow leaves. I just wanted to give a status update on my situation.. hopefully anyone else trying to quit can find common ground and be encouraged by shared experience. For perspective I am coming off of 18 months of daily usage, several times a day via a vaporizer. So my usage was rather heavy.. Actually ""smoking"" hardly produced an effect for me anymore because vapes are so much more efficient at delivering THC. At first this was a ""good"" thing but it ended up increasing my tolerance and overall dosage of THC even higher.

In the past I have tried to end my usage many times, and failed. This time feels different because I finally realize the reasons that caused me to give in so many times in the past. Contrary to all the ""marijuana isn't addictive"" bologna that is thrown about by /r/trees and the like, I have found the withdrawal symptoms to be incredibly challenging to deal with. Maybe it affects some people's brain chemistry differently, but honestly it's easy for an addict to keep deluding themselves that ""it's not addictive"" and ""marijuana doesn't have withdrawal symptoms"" if they never try to abstain from usage. I kept up this game for several years, and it was this perceived zero risk of addiction that first induced me to try marijuana.

First, I'll go over some of the positive aspects of quitting.

In the last seven days I have experienced a flurry of emotion. I feel remarkably clear-headed at times. Just yesterday I took a midterm and was amazed at how quickly I was computing the answers. I was able to hold much more information in my head simultaneously and more accurately, which was a huge confidence boost and motivator for me not to give up. I've also been amazed at the return of dreams, sometimes several per night, which is up from probably 1 dream every 2 months that I remembered whilst using daily. The double-meaning of weed causing you to give up your dreams is not lost on me.

Unfortunately with the good times have come the bad.. I have also felt anxious and irritable, and I've been unusually irritable around my girlfriend at times. Fortunately she understands what I'm going through and is quite supportive of me. In general I seem to be having unusual amounts of mood swings, probably exacerbated by all the stress school is putting me under right now. 

Fortunately it seems that the insomnia is slowly fading away as I'm actually getting tired at night now. Near the end of my usage my tolerance was so high that only primary reason I smoked every day was simply to get to sleep at night. Being restless and sleep-deprived is incredibly torturous and one of the primary reasons I gave up quitting in the past, so it's a great relief to see this start to fade.

Unfortunately since quitting I've also noticed my appetite decline, as many have reported. I seem to be having episodes of nausea off and on, often in response to coffee, which I am also trying to lower my dependence on. This morning I had a bagel and coffee for breakfast after being sleep-deprived and I'm just now getting over the feeling like I'm going to throw up. 

The anxiety is still there at a low level as well, and I'm having difficulty concentrating at times (which motivated me to write this post). Given all these withdrawal symptoms, I can see why I gave up in the past. These symptoms can be highly difficult to go through for anyone, and all the denial in the cannabis community tends to make you feel like a failure. But this experience is different: the symptoms are teaching me how much cannabis messes with my most basic of cycles, sleeping and eating. Overall it is motivating me *not* to give in, because I never want to deal with feeling this crap again.

Have been dealing with a lot of memories of my father's passing through my witnessing of a friend's father dying recently, so thought, 'What the hell?'

It was not what I remembered it to be.  Even as I was high, I realized it wasn't what I wanted any more.  I couldn't think; I never realized how much I cherished my ability to think.  I woke up and spent the next few days in 'the fog' (not high, but not all the way there mentally) and am just coming out of it now.  I coughed, and I couldn't stop thinking, 'What a silly, stupid decision.'

I had some issues with willpower at parties where Ms. Jane was available, but I honestly don't think its ever going to be a problem again.  I thought the second I smoked it would be all downhill - I would relapse back into my old habits/thinking.  Instead, I've only been emboldened: I have made the right decision.  My life has gotten 10x better since letting go of weed.

1376528917.0,24,self.leaves,1ke0t7,LSD &amp; Quitting,lsdftw85,24,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1ke0t7/lsd_quitting/,"This is going to be a long post, short story is I took 2 hits of acid on Saturday after deciding beforehand that I would focus on quitting throughout the trip.  I have had very few withdrawal symptoms (but it has only been 4 days).  I do not recommend this for most people but there may be some people out there who would benefit from this.

Background: I'm 28, I have smoked pretty much every day for the last 9 years.  I don't recall ever taking more than 10 days off during that time.  Recently I have decided that I am addicted due to the fact that I cannot slow down and cannot stop.  Every time I tried to stop I would experience all the most common symptoms.  I have been following this subreddit for a few months on and off and I relate to many many posts.  I smoke about an ounce and a half a month.  There is very little social aspect at this point, I smoke alone at home.  I live by myself.  My background with hallucinogens started in college, and acid was always my favorite drug.  I had not done acid in over a year prior to this weekend.

Over the past month I have really wanted to quit.  When I realized I couldn't, it freaked me out and I was strongly considering MA meetings (something I will still probably do).  I was at a festival the first weekend of August and came across doses.  I was thinking I was taking a step back when I bought them, but as it turns out maybe that was just what I needed.  I had read about hallucinogens being used in treatment of addiction and I decided to go for it.

Normally I would smoke a lot during any kind of trip.  And the thought of taking two hits of acid without any weed was actually really scary.  I had one bowl left on Saturday.  I decided to take the two hits, finish the weed, and then just see what happened.  I knew 4 hours later I would want to smoke.  I know the come down from acid fairly well and it used to suck without weed.  I figured if I could manage the cravings through my acid trip maybe I would discover how to manage my cravings afterwards.  I went into the trip with a strong resolution to stop smoking weed and to dig deep in my psyche to try and get rid of the addiction.  

I took the first hit at about 10:30am and just went outside.  I didn't smoke, there was something very comforting about having that last bowl sitting at home.  Obviously since I bought the acid at a festival I had no idea if it was even real or what the potency was so I figured I would let the first hit set in.  I walked a lot, listened to some music, and started coming up.  Once I knew I was tripping, I started thinking about smoking, why I wanted to stop, how fucked up it was that I couldn't stop, etc.  I just kept walking and thinking about that.  About 4 hours in I came home.  Making it through the first 4 hours without smoking was something of a lesson.  I didn't need weed, I just wanted it really bad.  I COULD make it without it.  When I got home I felt a very weird feeling, I looked at my bong and I could feel my lungs, it was like they were gasping for air but they were clearly gasping for smoke.  That is fucked up.  My lungs are so used to getting smoke that they know as soon as I walk in the door what is going to happen.  They need it.  The only withdrawal symptom I have felt is related to this in that my lungs from time to time feel like they really want to smoke.  I decided to take the other hit of acid (I definitely didn't want it laying around my apartment if I was going to take a hiatus from drugs and I thought it might make things much more challenging but it really didn't).  I then took my last hit of weed.  Thinking about it just now has made me want to smoke more than I have wanted to in a while.  I put my bong under the sink in the kitchen where I had been trying to put it the other times I wanted to stop.  I haven't touched it since.  I went back outside for about another 3 hours, this time I didn't bring music, it was just me walking around, thinking about the last 10 years and how much it has been defined by weed.  When I got home it was dark and I knew I probably wouldn't sleep for 5-6 more hours.  This was going to be the first test.  Surprisingly, it was fine, the cons of smoking far outweighed the benefit of smoking in my mind and I was able to just wait it out until I could fall asleep.  From reading about addiction really it is just a time game, you need to kill time.  The next day, the game just continued, I started a journal and I suppose the first day was the hardest.  I went outside for most of the day.  My appetite wasn't too bad, I didn't feel disgusted by food like I had at other times when I was ""quitting"" for 24-48 hours.  My sleeping has been fine, almost better than when I smoked.  I don't feel like I am having crazy mood swings.  I don't really feel any kind of withdrawal.  I have felt cravings and they have been very real but they have passed quickly.  After a couple passed that inspired much more confidence when I realized they are time based and not based on whether I actually smoke.   

In the past running out of weed for even just a few hours has left me a little bit crazy, scraping resin, doing anything to get more.  This has been the first time in almost 10 years that I haven't had any weed and I have had no intention of getting more.  The first time I have been able to quit voluntarily for more than 48 hours.  Other abstentions had been due to vacations or some other extenuating circumstance, and even on vacation I was usually trying to find some.  

If I had not been well-versed in acid I would never have tried this alone or probably at all, and I do not recommend that people with little experience with hallucinogens try this.  There is also some threat of a bad trip if you are trying to quit because you are depressed about your life, in my case I have accepted the problems in my life and there were many times on Saturday that I was just thinking I have nothing to feel bad about I just want to stop and I am going to stop.  

I guess I just wanted to share my experience because it actually has really surprised me, I did not think after I came down that my withdrawal would magically be easier.  I just thought maybe it would and I decided to give it a shot.  We all know that weed is psychologically addicting and the physical addiction is not the main issue.  Acid (and other hallucinogens) can take your mind to a place that you would never be able to get to otherwise.  

I still have challenges in front of me for sure, my best friend smokes but he is out of town this weekend which gives me a little more time to acclimate.  I am by no means out of the woods.  But I feel 1000 times closer than I have ever felt before and it feels good.

When I was still smoking pot, I did it quite heavily. Roughly 5 fat bowls a day. I had been smoking for atleast 3 years, so weed at this point didn't really affect me. Around the end of my weed escapades I noticed a eerie sense of unreality slowly creeping up on me. The more I smoked, the more pronounced it was. I did some research on it and found it was something called depersonalization, which is basically your body's defense against anxiety (which I am a sufferer of). Nothing felt real to me anymore, I had to convince myself that I was seeing something, or hearing sounds. Nowadays, it's so bad my life is nearly indistinguishable from my dreams. Except my dreams could never be as much of a nightmare as my waking life.

Ever since I quit smoking pot (which started as a tolerance break, later developed into full blown panic attacks whenever I smoked), I have had the worst anxiety of my life. Every single day I feel sick, because apparently (according to my therapist/doctor) the anxiety altered my gastrointestinal system. When I quit, I was still in my first month of college. I had to drop out because I was having panic attacks in class. This horrible wave of anxiety and nausea would hit me and I would be forced to leave the room, and now this happens on a daily basis whenever I leave my house (to varying degrees). I can't get a job, I can't go back to school, and I can't live a proper life. As stupid as it sounds, my life was better when I was still smoking pot, although it's not like I can go back to it. I am completely ruined. A miserable, anxiety/depression/depersonalization ridden wreck, hollow shell of a human being. I have never felt this horrible in my life.

4 days ago I tried taking medication for my problems (citalopram), and I barely made it through a day. Laid in bed having panic attacks, feeling like I have to vomit, and then proceeded to feel awful the following days. So I can't take medication, meditation doesn't help, and the therapy doesn't seem to stick with me.

You may have sleepless nights, over and over. I know I certainly did. If you don't want to deal with it naturally, take an over-the-counter sleeping medication called ""Melatonin"". It will save you hours of torture, trust me. The pills are usually sold in 3mg, 5mg, and 10mg. Warning: Stop using Melatonin after a month (or less), and seek a doctor if you still have sleeping problems. However, your sleep issues should be resolved within the first 2 weeks if you behave healthy.

2. Exercise during the day (read:the day) in order to wear your body out.

3. Don't take caffeine after 2pm. You'll fuck yourself over as it has a half-life of about 5 hours. Just don't do it. You'll thank yourself later.

4. Eat healthy. If your body becomes supplemented with nutrients, it will repair the neurotransmitters (the weed wore out) at a much faster pace.

I believe we're all here for the same reason.  Once you hear that voice say ""enough"" there's really no turning back.  Endless rationalization and relapses take their toll and we've all felt that.

I'll call my parents this weekend.  I'll restring my guitar after this nap.  It's not as though cannabis was destroying my life but I absolutely ~~believe~~ know it was holding me back.  No - I was holding myself back.  I'm the one in charge of my life and nothing is going to happen unless I make it happen.

*This is an aside.  For anyone in college - please pay attention.

Don't take the easy track.  I did that and I regret it every day.  College is a time to mature and enrich your mind.  Don't waste it.*

I work for an incredible small business and was constantly asking myself ""Why don't they involve me more? Why don't they value me?""  It wasn't until a few days of sobriety mixed with several years of serious introspection that things started to click.  I have to value *myself*.

That's as far ahead as I can think and that's as far ahead as I need to think.  I don't expect it to get easier.  I expect it to get more difficult every day and that is a challenge I am ready to face.

I enjoyed my last high and braced my psyche for the withdrawals to come. They didn't.

Since I quit, I've felt a clarity that's been missing from my life for so long. I wondered why I didn't do this earlier. Nausea is minimal, sleep comes easier than expected, food goes down the same way it always did. The shadow of my addiction crept up on me unnoticed. 

A couple nights ago, I realized why I kept to the smoky embrace. I broke down at my place of employment in a fit of tears in some frozen corner of the freezer next to the cake batter ice cream. Why? Feelings of hopelessness brought on by an incorrect order. The wrong size of coffee. I realized that before I smoked, I was a glass flower of emotion, ready to break down at the drop of a hat. My emotional maturity was stunted by the grass, and I was feeling depression that had been absent since my hair was greasy and my voice was still finding a tone to stick to. The next night, I cried over feelings of self-loathing. I was fretting over soup that hadn't been put on and I broke down over breaking down so easily. 

Today, the waterworks made a devastating comeback after my father happened upon me working just fifteen minutes into my shift. I hadn't talked to him, called him, or made any attempt to return his own calls since I picked up the stuff, out of fear that I'd disappoint the man. I tearfully apologized to him for avoiding him for years, while he told me that he loved me and that he was proud of me, as I had just made management two months prior to today. His words strengthened my resolve, and I silently vowed to not disappoint the man whose back would not break, in between bouts of sobbing quietly in the freezer, ignoring caring words from my co-workers.

Even after ending my years-long stint under the haze, I cannot find myself to write concisely and I don't know where I'm going with this. My emotions found themselves flowing onto the screen and I only hope that someone reads this and carries this little bit of light with them in their days of clarity.

You want good grades, good health, better relationships, whatever. So, there is something that you want, and in theory nothing should get between you and what you want. Trees can easily get in your way, for all kinds of reasons, most importantly in that it affects the part of your brain that motivates you, and also makes everything seem ok, almost driving the sense of complacency that many of us enjoy. Smoking up for a bit, but then not getting your homework or whatever done: we’ve all done it, at least once. I dont understand the neuroscience of it, but it does. For the past few days I have been thinking about what I want and what I need to do to get there. I didnt like what I saw in myself. I realized that I can be the best I can be, and the only thing holding me back was the past choices I’ve made and the fear of making them again. I know now that nothing, nothing, can hold me back from what I want except myself.
 I have always been a good friend, and it is relatively easy for me to make new ones. How “good” are my friends right now? Not very, not for me right now. I love them, they have helped me through thick and thin as I have them, they are the people I smile with and laugh with. But: they smoke, and I don’t want to anymore. I’m not saying never talk to your friends ever again, but really take stock of who your “friends” are. What holds you together as a friend group? Is it hanging out or basketball or video games or guns? It might be marijuana. And if thats the case, then you need to get the hell away from them, at least for a little while. So many people come on here and start a post “Oh I messed up big time” or something like that and the reason behind the post is that they really didnt want to quit anyway. If you are a problem drinker, you stay away from your old friends that you used to drink with.
We all need to look at our problems with a little bit of perspective. We are all smart, capable people, well accepted by society, and we contribute to that society and we like to and want to contribute something that we think is the best we can give. We are here because we have addictions, not in the strict sense of the word, but we have habits that drive our behavior and we don’t like the effect of those behaviors on our lives. We might hate ourselves or get down on ourselves for our actions, but the key to doing what you want is not getting down, it is looking forward. Someone that I look up to, someone that smokes lots of weed, is Joe Rogan. And he says we all need to be the heroes of our own stories. Its that easy. Think about each thing that you do as part of a comic book. Do you want to be the graphic novel about the pothead that no one will understand, or the comic book hero that takes on the bad guys and wins? Im being the comic book guy that wins, and I'm 5 days sober

All I have to say is, I’m being the hero of my own story, and I’m looking for some sidekicks. Any takers?

I was smoking up to 4-5 spliffs a day. How did it affect me? Short term memory loss, digging into my head for simple words, heavy breathing, weight gaining, lack of motivation, and increased appetite. I remember it used to affect my bedroom times with past girlfriends. Often times I had to smoke before I had sex to stay erect. It was pathetic. 

It absolutely drained my wallet and willingness to try new things. I'd come home early from a fun night at the bars to get stoned. How lame is that? I remember smoking before class and browsing the web, barely scooting by. I was diagnosed with ADHD as a young kid, pot definitely didn't help.

Sure, I had some fantastic times smoking weed. Me and my friends used to jam in my basement into oblivion. Abbey Road sounded *so* good and food tasted *so* delicious. But when you **have** to smoke before you go out to dinner with you parents, somethings gotta give. 

What it came down to was this- moderation is fine, but when you can't control your urges, it's just... scary. And sad. Don't you want to be in control of everything you do? Don't you want to be able to function and enjoy life without an unhealthy substance like weed? If you can handle it, be legitimately happy not stoned, and control your urges, more power to you. But damn, that's gotta be rare.

I'm just finishing day 8. The first few days were tough. I can't tell you how many bowls I've turned down, and how many times I wanted to pick up a bag and roll a big ol' spliff. But, I didn't. I focused on other things, and read r/leaves. ""you can do it"", ""I don't feel foggy anymore"", and ""I feel great"" made it seem attainable.

What differences do I feel on day 8?

* I'm not absolutely exhausted by the end of every day
* I'm not cutting occasions short to dart home and smoke
* My thoughts are becoming more and more clear
* I'm actually engaging with people that I talk to, rather than dipping in and out of listening
* I'm able to finish things I've started
* My heart rate is steadier
* My appetite is under control

My girlfriend says she loves the ""new"" me. Of course she loved the ""old"" me as well, but the second I'd smoke, I'd stop engaging as much and float off into my headspace. Now, I'm **present** for every moment.

I don't think anyone can know if they are done for good, but I certainly needed to put the control back in my own hands. It feels amazing.

**r/leaves, without you, I don't think I would have found the motivation to quit. I've been telling myself to quit for over 3 years and after reading peoples stories, wisdom, and motivation, I knew I was not alone. From the bottom of my soon to be healthier heart, thank you so much for existing. This is an extremely valuable resource that I'll constantly chime in on to motivate others.

1350008649.0,23,self.leaves,11cfv1,When your day 1 should/should not be,,27,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/11cfv1/when_your_day_1_shouldshould_not_be/,"I'm a bit older and a successful kicker of the habit. Was a daily smoker (more or less) from 17 to 25. College fail-out. Now I'm 28 and in med school, in the US. Quitting was the thing that turned it all around.

But I failed many, many times, and I've been noticing some patterns of failure around here too, so I wanted to introduce what I hope will be helpful tips to maximal success. I'll list them then give my reasoning.

When NOT to quit:

-when you're going on vacation or making any type of short-term temporary relocation

-while or right after you're high

-any day in which you've already blazed


When TO quit:

-during the time of day you would normally smoke

-under the most average/normal conditions possible for you (e.g. not on vacation, while living our boring day-to-day lives)


1. Vacation. This may seem like an easy head start and a good opportunity. You're with family, and/or completely physically disconnected from your stuff and your dealer. But when you get BACK and all those environmental associations come rushing back to you, you're going to smoke and you're going to feel like shit, defeated. The time until you decide to quit once again (usually months) is how long it takes you to get over this sense of defeat and helplessness. Avoid this feeling at all costs. 


2. After you've gotten high. I can't tell you how many times I decided to quit either while I was high or right after I came down. This is useless. Your mind is in complete non-fiend mode after you toke, so it's the easiest time to make this decision but it sets you up for a hard failure. It seems so easy, like you could live without out so so easily, but when the next day comes, it's suddenly VERY difficult and your will is completely demoralized by these contrasting feelings. Again, we're back to defeat and powerlessness over self.

To be clear: it's okay to make the decision whenever, but your day 1 shouldn't BEGIN until you hit the time of day when you'd usually smoke and you're there to say no. 24 hours later, you find yourself in the same time of day and you've completed day 1. 

The idea here is to pull off what is ACTUALLY a strong start. You need to be there to say no to all the fiending compulsions when they are at their strongest, under the most normal conditions possible that would all formerly be telling you to smoke. This does NOT mean to hang out with your pothead friends. It means saying no to hanging out and smoking when that's all you really want to do. This raw display of strength has a perpetuating effect over time on your own mind.

I found r/leaves and put it on my front page about the time I decided to quit; it's helped me know that there are other people who struggle with the same emotions and physical problems I do.


I'm writing today because I feel just terrible. I'm noticing how unfocused my mind is. I thought it would get better by now. I feel like I can't think at all, overwhelmed and underwhelmed, unable to be myself. I get angry very easy and am highly reactive. I get the feeling people don't like being around me. Sober people as well as old friends. I am unable to enjoy the things I was doing while I was using and I'm scared to try anything new. I'm scared that people can tell I'm a burnout and will always judge me as such. 

 My health isn't very good- 50lbs overweight, a car accident 6 years ago has left both my knees in poor condition (running has been out of the question), and high blood pressure is a concern. I've been going for walks every night, they aren't very far, but it's better than nothing. I've spent a lot less time on the computer and my apartment has never been cleaner. But now that I've gotten comfortable with my personal surroundings, I feel lost. 

When I read peoples personal stories here on leaves, I can't help but notice people are running, weight lifting, eating healthy, and getting out and doing new things and generally being successful with their new found freedom. I'm not sure those are things I can do right now. Other peoples ability to make such a drastic change is intimidating and I worry that since I can't do the same thing, I'm doomed.

I have been a smoker of both cannabis and tobacco for 6 and 3 years respectively now, and I can honestly say that the toll it has taken on my life has become too great at this point.
I'm living in a hole, with no job being supported by my parents.  I quit my job one night three weeks ago in a high rage when my boss was being rude to me.  I burned through my money almost as quickly as if I had set fire to it, smoking bowl after bowl, in a state of permadepression.  
It was the about only thing that I ever had on my mind the first two and a half years of college too, and I still have no idea what I'm going to do or where I'm headed.
I believe in the spiritual and healing powers of the cannabis plant, and I have taken it for granted by abusing it day after day for years.
So here is my plan.  I'm dropping everything in a box and locking it away.  I spent about 15-20 dollars on weed daily.  It boggles my mind to think how much money I would have to this day if I didn't buy so much weed.  I'd basically have so much money (for my means) I wouldn't know what to do with it.

So I'm getting a box, and I am going to still behave like an addict.  Anything I can do to get 15 dollars, each day, and I'm going to put it in a box.  What this originally was supposed to be is a test.  A 30 day trial to see how my life changes.  After 30 days, I should have 420 dollars in the box.  I'm going to take it out of the box at the end of the 30 days and buy the things that I have been wanting to buy for the past three years.  (mainly clothing, as I am still rocking the same threads since high school basically)

I quit once when I was 17 after losing my job because I was high, and at that time most of the vices in my life were weed related. I didn't smoke for about 2 years, I may have smoked a few times in the 2nd year but never turned myself back on to weed.

I started smoking again after I sprained my ankle when I was 20. Dancing was what I loved, and what kept me from doing bad things. After I wasn't able to dance, I started gaming, drinking, and smoking heavily. I eventually healed, but kept the substance abuse habits with me.

Years later, as an adult, I was able to lead what seemed to be a stable lifestyle. I had friends, girlfriends, sex partners, money, talent, and a job. However, all of those things have faded away and I'm back at square one with my life at one of the lowest rock bottoms ever.

I stopped doing the things I loved and that inspired me, and started doing things to take the pain I had experienced during my journey, away.

Anger, bitterness, rage, and overall depression is a lot more common in my life than it used to be. I can't blame weed, but I can say that I'm no longer happy unless I'm high. I can literally go from ""I hate the world and tonight I'm gonna get even with society"" to ""LOL thats a funny cat"" in just seconds with a good hit from the blunt.

I remember after quitting weed, I relied on natural highs instead. My way of thinking became so positive I couldn't understand why people smoked weed when there were other ways of acheiving natural highs that make you healthier, happier, more creative, more attractive, and cultivate an even stronger sense of well-being and fulfillment.

My sources of ""natural highs"" were: Dance, yoga, meditation, exercise, lifting weights, writing, praying, doing daring shit, girls, friends, drawing, fashion, raw nutritious fruits and vegetables, eating healthy, exploring, learning, and the success high. 

I haven't felt the success high in ages. When I wake up in the morning I get high and go on the computer. When I go to work I smoke a blunt while driving there. When I get off work I smoke on the way home, just to get on my computer again and smoke some more later. Wherever I go, I smoke. Whatever I do, I do it high.

I think my brain has forgotten how to think in a positively inspired manner. Some people can get high and still get up and go places. I can, but in a limited way. I'll go to work, but not the gym. I'll grab food, but skip out on going to the DMV. I'll browse reddit for hours, but not pay my parking tickets. I'll unlock weapons in battlefield 3 but not finish a single page of studying. Procrastination is a separate problem, but I don't think being high all the time makes it better. Having no initiative, inspiration, or strong-minded determination has made me very ""mentally weak"".

My last girlfriend I was with for about a year. One of the issues we were concerned with was weed turning into the center of our relationship. I promised her it wouldn't, and it really wasnt, but I started becoming so dependent on smoking that I was in a bad mood if I wasn't high, and therefore always had to smoke around her. She smoked a lot too, but I think I definitely outdid her.

I don't want to call it sobriety, because it's such a boring word. I still plan on getting high, just not on mind-altering substances, or sources of over-stimulation like porn or gaming or violence.

There are a lot personal problems I need to work on, but I think having a clear mind first is the best approach. Weed may not always be available, and I need to learn how to cope without it. It's hard to lose weight when you have the munchies, hard to stay disciplined and focused when your mind is in the clouds, hard to be social when you're in your own world, and hard to get the ""get-up-and-go"" when you're stoned off your ass.

I look forward to this joruney. It will be hard as I anticipate a large amount of anxiety, tension, stress, rage, aggression, and aggravation to follow me for the next few weeks, or even months, but fuck, I want my life back. There are better things in life. Maybe I'll smoke again in the summer and be the type to just take 2 hits and pass, maybe I'll never smoke again, but right now I need to take my life back in my control.

I appreciate the supportive posts from people here, and intend on attending Marijuana Anonymous again, regardless of how boring or awkward it is. It's hard as fuck to quit as a college student living in LA where weed is more common than cigarettes, but I can do it! I have to!

**Day 2 UPDATE: Last night I was not able to sleep at all. I worked out late at night and was a little pumped, but was not able to sleep at all through the entire night. I had a lot of psychotic and negative thoughts the whole night. I felt like there was an endless battle going on in my mind but I just chose to stay calm and push through it.**

**I have been a bit more alert socially, listen to people better, give better responses, and find it easier to carry conversation and actually care about what they're saying.

Through all the years of addiction, now coming to an end with this realization, you were the most precise tool I could have wielded in systematically destroying my life. My family, friends, and self are damaged.

It's time to say goodbye. The fun is gone. The magic is gone, all you are is a negative influence, making me shy, locked in my thoughts and paranoid about every social situation that might come my way. And boy am I fucking tired of it.

I've been lurking for a while but finally decided to join in. This community has already helped me so much in understanding my addiction and I want to say thanks.

I'll keep this brief; Started at 15, 25 now. It wasn't a problem until it I used it as a crutch while trying to fight much stronger addictions (narcotics). Kicked the nasty stuff but was left with this beast of burden. In school I smoked everyday all day. Went to almost every class high. Only hung out with people who smoked.  Best friend grew for years so supply was always immediate and plentiful which never helped. When I joined the work force I'd light up at 5:05 in my car on my way home and never get anything done after work. I don't even eat when I'm under the influence (ironic I know) or I'll eat a bunch of shit food at 11pm. Recently moved after a really bad breakup and wanted to start over. The beast followed. 

I've quit for short periods (a week tops) of time over the past 2 years but I always go back. It's like an abusive relationship. It is an abusive relationship.

Thanks to /r/DecidingToBeBetter,/r/getdisciplined, /r/socialskills, and a few others I've been able to get my life to 97% where I want it. I've kicked the majority of my bad habits, achieved goals, and am very proud of who I am. 

Except weed. I just can't seem to let her go. 

I'm on yet another day 4 today. Only because my dealer got arrested and I don't know anyone else. I'd like to think I can keep this going but I know the next time the opportunity arises, or the time after that, etc. I'll slip. It's terribly frustrating and depressing. 

For anyone who read this far I have a good tip for dealing with withdrawal symptoms that I don't see discussed here: L-Theanine. It's an amino acid found in Green Tea that calms me down and lets me sleep and not rip my hair out. It's also great for anxiety. It comes in capsules, make sure to get the 'SunTheanine' kind.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text and best of luck to everyone. May the force be with you.

**TL;DR: Drug addict, bummed on my lack of self control, L-Theanine is a savior for withdrawal symptoms.**

As i sit here, I KNOW i NEED to stop, but I also am cursed with the knowledge of me being ""young"" and I am ""allowed"" to ""enjoy"" my life being so.

Well i must have been a damn infant when i started because i had barely hit double digits [10] when i was first introduced, well actually kidnapped by the seductive Mary Jane. I remember it clear as ever, I was at Vans Warped Tour with my out-of-state older cousin (only 16 then) in beautiful San Diego. I til this day still dont know why she did, but she did. Might have been my parents just had a nasty divorce and I was fucked up. Mentally, emotionally and spiritually. I still blame this on rap music (haha) but I can't rid myself the idea she pitied me, wanting to help subdue my stress.

Worst mistake of my life, completely on my part, I dont blame her. I was in the crowd watching, well hearing The Offspring because i was so little. I remember being afraid to tell my cousin i was interested in trying it because i didn't want her to tell my mother. I knew she smoked regularly and attempted to hide it from me. Attempted. I was too damn smart for my own good. Connected too many dots without being exposed to them prior. Well, to my surprise, when the spiderman pipe came passing along to her hands, for the 3rd time, I finally spoke up and asked if i could. She reluctantly handed it to me, and i dont remember the rest of the day from then on.

I just remember not feeling ""high"" that first time. Feeling so, and my cousin staying for the weekend, I wanted to do it again. We went out with some random ass fucking people (one of them not long after was admitted to a mental institution i found out) that my cousin befriended at the tour. We went out and ate, then proceeded to the beach to smoke again. The only memory i have from then on is being so, so... out of it. I vaguely remember telling my cuzzo that i couldnt feel my legs as we were walking on the sand... then it was all blank. 

She still tells me to this day about it. She regrets it so much, i can see it in her eyes whenever we smoke. I keep telling her that it doesnt affect me, it doesnt affect me like you think. It didnt either. Well it does now have adverse effects on me that I loathe. It takes me to the point of intense discouragement to do every daily activities, takes my drive away to accomplish things. My ambition is suffering, and i know it. I dont let it show to her thought for her sake. but the thing is, she has now graduated from medical school, acquired a great full time job in her field, has her own place and seems to be overall happy. Shes now 24, and still smokes. Im now 18, and still smoke. Makes me feel like complete shit because after i first tried it i couldnt get it out my head. I remember being SO DAMN YOUNG I couldnt even tell my closest of friends what I had done and wish to do more, because i didnt want them to judge me. 

I began fucking up in school, getting arrested so many times i dont even want to know at this point, getting locked up 5 times before i was 16, being on probation for 3.5 years (when it was originally a one year term), being on house arrest 8 times before i turned 16 and so many other things i dont wish to say. I began living life in constant desire to get high. Believe me when i fucking say i did just that. Ive spent no less than $40,000 on marijuana, amongst other narcotics. I wasnt the kid to buy a gram here and then. It was buy as much as my amount of money i had then would allow me, which was always a ridiculous amount because I stole it from my fathers wallet (passive aggresively taking my ""pain"" out on him and his alcoholism) ive longed stop doing so, but i cant help but thinking why he never noticed. Was it because he was drunk so much? Was it because he knew what and why I did it? Ill never know and ill never ask him. Im talking i was buying quarters everyday, IN 7TH GRADE! Gradually moving up to ounces everyday by the time i was a sophomore.  I was every single one of my dealers best goddamn customer. I swear to god, i wish i knew someone like me when i was slanging on and off (age 14-17). i would just get lost in my thoughts when i was high, i have a highly over-analytical thought process, that pisses me the fuck off now whenever i get high. I dont know how weak i am, but even though i hate it, and say so verbally, i continue to do so on a daily basis.

I have now told myself I need to quit for more than two years. I continue to spend handfulls of my NOT hard earned cash on this bitch. Yes, i feel Mary jane is now a bitch. I cannot apply myself to anything for longer than a few minutes, i cannot concentrate worth SHIT and now get relatively anti-social when im high, which is every minute of every day. ive accepted the fact of being ""perma-fried"" because i can literally go 3 weeks (as far as ive made it in 8 years, when i was in rehab for my benzo relapse) without smoking AND STILL BE HIGH. IDK is it because i smoked some of that synethic shit for a little while, or is it the fact that i seemingly have algae made of THC coating my cerebral? I know this is a marijuana thread... but i have no doubt in my mind this WAS a gateway drug. I was into every drug under the sun except for heroin, pcp and crystal. (sadly both ive tried except pcp)
but i became addicted to xanax, basically ended my life, reputation, all that jazz. Lost every single one of my friends, lost respect from my family members, and myself. All this time of hurting others, i was high on this bitch, amongst other things.

Im now about to graduate high school, have no job, have no car (totaled it, along with my mothers on xanax &amp; alcohol, AND that bitch), have no license, and have no drive. I want to stop. I really truly do. I cant. I moved across the country to rid myself of drug influence in my sunshine state, and the whole 3-day fucking car ride with my father to my destination, i reeked like a straight plant. I was sweating so profusely it smelt like bud. THC was literally oozing out of my pores. He kept asking me if i snuck some nugs with em, after he repeatedly told me not to do so. Might have actually been the first time i listened to my father in my life. Anyway, that told me i needed to direly stop, but guess what????? As soon as i got there, i searched shamelessly for a new connect. Oh, I got one. When my grandmother took me to sign up for school, some kid, after their school was let out, asked me if i smoked. What kind of luck is that? the first person who interacts with me halfway across the country asks me if i smoke. I replied, ""Im from Cali"". Guess where we went? right around the corner, and smoked reggy. First time in my life that i had done so i can say. Then i returned to my grandmothers car and acted like nothing happened. Nothing did happen. It was as normal as walking is to me.mI fucking hate it, I honestly hate myself, I hate weed. And im about to pick some up  right NOW to ""enjoy"" this friday with my year-younger cousin (WHOM I INTRODUCED M-J TO) and i cant stop longing and trying to quit. i need help, vitally.

I appreciate anyone who actually read my overly descriptive sob story. I appreciate all support, maybe even some ""constructive"" criticism.

this weekend i made a horrible decision to smoke at one of my best friends birthday parties. i was nothing but paranoid, miserable and hated everything. i hate feeling that way.

today i took the real first steps to getting over my addiction.

My boss (Uncle, i work for family) asked why I had been acting weird the last few weeks, and I explained to him the addiction. He was so understanding and supportive and his brother, my other uncle, had gone through EXACTLY what I am going through now many many years ago.

I also informed my mother (who smokes for medical reasons) and my little brother who is my best friend and has been worried about me for a while.

I gave away my paraphernalia and am starting a new today. I refuse to be dragged down by this substance and not live my life to the fullest.

here's to another attempt and hopefully the most successful!

A couple T-breaks and dry spells here and there, but in general, 7 years of daily smoking.

It used to improve things. It used to give me focus at work, focus in my creative endeavors, and it was just damn nice to relax with a bowl. But now? It's just normal. Smoking is so damn normal, it's like oxygen. It's so normal, sometimes I don't even think about it. I'll be sitting at the computer and suddenly there will be a packed bowl in my hand, and I wasn't even consciously aware that I was packing it.

But it *doesn't* give me focus at work anymore, and it *definitely* doesn't give me inspiration in my creative stuff either. Now when I smoke, I'm just annoyed. Annoyed that I have this shitty habit that doesn't do anything for me anymore. It just pisses me off. But...I can't stop! I've had some half-assed attempts at cutting back, but they don't work. I need to go cold-turkey.

I'm going cold-turkey this Saturday. Why Saturday? That's the day I move into my new house. I'm thinking that being in a new environment will be a good time to establish new habits. I've been planning this for a month so far, and I'm really looking forward to quitting. But I'm also really scared. I'm scared that I've built up this ""I'll quit when I move!"" thing, and that what I'm really doing is just putting off quitting because I have a convenient excuse.

Luckily, I have my SO's support here and he wants to quit as well. It doesn't mess up his life quite as badly as it's messed up mine, but he agrees that it's no longer a special thing. It's just normal, daily habit that isn't doing much for him. We both need to lay off the munchies. Neither of us want to quit forever, but I know that I need to take a very, very long break. I don't know how long it needs to be. Long enough for me to break the habit and stop feeling the need to smoke. I *never* want to be a daily, regular smoker again.

I've already quit getting high for work a long time ago. I'm a baker and I'm up at 4:00 a.m. on work days, and smoking at that hour has always just seemed absurd. So fortunately, I won't need to make any adjustments there. 

I know one of the things people recommend for quitting smoking is getting exercise. That's great, but I already have good, regular exercise habits. And boooooy is that post-workout bowl the bowl I crave *the most* during the day.

My problem is smoking during my free time. I describe free time as any time I'm not working or exercising. Smoking ruins my free time. I used to *do things* during my free time. But now? I just aimlessly wander the internet, continually numbing myself with more weed so I don't feel too bad about not being productive.

I can be so much more than I am now. I am smart. I am talented. I am hard working! But this fucking shit is *fucking me up*. I'm almost 26, and I feel like I should have progressed much further than I have in my career as a baker. I'm not doing anything to improve my skills as a cook/baker at home. I could be doing great things at my job, but I'm simply going through the motions, being ""good enough."" But it's not good enough for me. I know I can be better, and it's killing me.

I'm mostly trying to convey the rationalizing I've done over the years, and maybe a reader will spot that they are doing some of the same rationalizing, too.

I've slowly come to realize over the past few months that almost all of the problems plaguing me lately are directly linked to how much marijuana I smoke. I'm 23 and started smoking when I was 18. For the first few years, I thought it was a great habit. I only smoked about a 1/4 oz per semester, which was far, far cheaper than my alcohol habit. I did it infrequently enough that I always got very high and never spent much money on it, and as a result I became extremely complacent with marijuana. My family has a history of alcoholism, and so I was always very careful with alcohol and it was the only drug I was ever worried about becoming addicted to. But while I am very comfortable with my relationship with alcohol at this point (I was certainly close to alcoholism a couple of years ago), it seems that weed snuck by undetected and has created many problems for me without me even realizing it because I wasn't paying attention.

I smoked mostly in moderation for about 3 years, which is why I think it took me so long to realize it when I had actually become addicted. Addicts can't moderate themselves for 3 years, so clearly I wasn't one, right? But about 2.5 years in, the habit morphed into smoking every weekend, and then during the week, and then every day. And now I've been a daily smoker for about two years - multiple times per day for the past year and a half.

I had other rationales for why I didn't have a problem. I'm lucky enough to have friends/relatives all over the country (US). So I like to visit them over long breaks, and rarely have access to marijuana in those periods, and it has never bothered me in the slightest. I actually looked forward to clearing my head for a few weeks before heading back into the daily smoking haze. So, clearly if my years are peppered with periods of forced sobriety with no withdrawal effects, I'm not addicted, right?

More rationalizing. My smoking habits seemed to be fine in college, by the standard I was using. The one big lesson my parents ingrained into my brain growing up was that ""as long as you do well in school, you're free to do what you like."" I managed to graduate at the top of my class in college. What addict could handle taking more than the maximum number of classes every semester and get straight A's while double majoring in hard sciences? Being raised to think that school is all that matters, the fact that I could outdo everybody I know academic-wise while being stoned 24/7 meant to me that my marijuana habit was completely fine to me. So clearly I don't have a problem, right? However, my grades did start to slip during my final semester, and now I'm in grad school and my grades are the worst they've ever been, and on top of that I failed the entrance examination that everyone is supposed to pass at the start. Thankfully I can take it a couple of more times, but I know why I failed, and its because its hard as hell and spending the summer smoking weed instead of studying led directly to failure!

But after graduating college and moving across the country for grad school, I've come to realize that I literally do nothing other than study and smoke weed. Even then, most of the time I am in class or studying, I am high. And because of this, it makes all of my work take longer, giving me even less free time. Very few of my cohorts blaze either, so I am extremely socially isolated. I've almost forgotten how to make friends with people who don't smoke weed. I tend to leave campus immediately after class so that I can go straight home and blaze, never even giving anybody a chance to talk to me or vice versa.

Now that I've explained the rationalizing, here's the evidence that I have confronted that made me realize that I had a problem.

In the past 6 months, I have spent many weekends sitting in my apartment alone, smoking weed all day, and turning down the invitations from my friends to go do something fun because I'd rather be stoned. This time last year, I had an incredibly fulfilling social life and way more friends than I knew what to do with. Now, moving to the other side of the country, I was totally expecting that I wouldn't have the social life that took me 5 years to develop in college - that makes sense. But because I have been spending all of my time smoking weed alone, my social life has barely even gotten off of the ground. I'm lucky to hang out with friends more than a few times per month. This is not what I want!

I used to have a bunch of hobbies - going to concerts, guitarist/singer in a band, doing improv, juggling, etc. But that has all faded now. Even when I do have the energy for these things, I frequently don't have the money. Just this last Friday, one of my favorite bands of all time was playing in town. I really wanted to go, but I knew I didn't have enough money because I needed to buy weed. So I sat around and smoked weed instead. Then just a couple of hours ago, I randomly remember that I HAD ALREADY BOUGHT A TICKET WEEKS AGO! I was just stoned when I bought it and had forgotten! AHHHH! This is not what I want!

I cursed myself up and down for this. I decided to compute a number I've been terrified of computing ever since my habit became daily: how much do I spend? Thankfully, I live in a MM state, so I buy all of my stuff legally and could just check my credit and debit cards. I was shocked - almost $1000 on weed and paraphenalia since January 1st! This is not what I want!

No wonder I'm so fucking broke all the time. No wonder I have zero free time. No wonder my social life has become nonexistent. No wonder I failed my department's PhD entrance exam (thank god they let you retake it). It all seems so obvious in retrospect. Weed, I'm sick of your shit! And I'm ready to give it up soon.

I don't think I'm totally prepared yet. I'm in the middle of quitting smoking cigarettes right now (3 weeks cigarette free! my record is 3 months though), and trying to make too many drastic changes at once just leads to all of them failing in my personal experience. But lurking in this forum for the past month or so has put all of the pieces into perspective for me, and I hope will give me the strength to finally put this destructive habit to rest (destructive to me - I know that others can keep it in moderation).

Smoking for me was one of the most important things in my life. I would like to believe that it wasn't *the* most important thing in my life but at the end of the day it probably was. I wasn't a completely dysfunctional person; I was still intelligent, I still worked, I still went to school, I still had some friends, I still had some money. I wasn't a soulless person; I had a moral code that guided my choices, I had a vision of myself as a teacher, a father, a cherished friend. I wanted to give back to the world; I didn't steal, I didn't cheat, I didn't lie too much. I paid my taxes, I drove the speed limit. I smiled. 

I was smoking every single day without fail; I was smoking a minimum of three sessions a day and during each session I was smoking whatever amount was required to get me ripped. Sometimes it was just a pinch; sometimes it was a blunt. More than once it was a few blunts. 

I wasn't a happy person before I started blazing. I struggled with insomnia from when I was a young kid, I got depressed during high school, and then I got even more depressed after high school ended. My life seemed shitty and I didn't want to live; it sucked my family was poor, it sucked that a girl I cared about left me, it sucked I was stuck in a small town, and it sucked that I seemed to experience constant physical pain. I felt like there was almost nothing of value that could come out of my existence other than more pain, despair, and an eventual death, complete with a rainy funeral that very few would attend. 

I wasn't really one of these people who was a jolly ""Let's get high!"" kind of person. Smoking was fun but it became a self-medicating act very quickly. The idea of smoking socially was strange; why would anyone want to take medicine with me? I mostly liked to put on some music and walk through a nature preserve near my home with my dog, exploring the natural world and the inner world of my mind. 

Deep down I really wanted to quit. I could see so many pitfalls that I was falling into because of my addiction. I was isolating myself from everyone; I was blowing my disposable income and preventing myself from getting ahead; I was getting older but not growing. On one hand I felt that my usage was actually making me smarter; I was able to grasp spiritual principles for the first time, but I couldn't seem to muster the will to actually apply them to my life. I could understand but I couldn't act. When I wasn't high they didn't seem to actually matter. 

I tried a bunch of times to quit. I could almost always stay clean a week but after awhile I would lose the desire to quit and would revert back to daily smoking after a single puff. I would rationalize and justify getting high as a remedy to my boredom, my fear, my depression, my self-diagnosed medical problems, my self. I really wanted to stop but not as much as I wanted to continue. ""It's not the right time"" became a mantra.

I decided to approach quitting differently. I never half-assed using, so I resolved to pour myself 100% into my recovery. I started going to NA meetings, I started taking the advice of people on these boards, and I started living simply for today. I admitted to myself and to others that I am an addict. I decided not to listen to my own rationalizations anymore; I decided that it's okay to be depressed, it's okay to be afraid, and ultimately that it's okay to *feel*. I don't have to live my life from the high tower in my mind, that's been my choice and as such I can choose differently. 

During the past month I have noticed some changes in myself, some things that haven't changed, and some hope for the future. I feel much more grounded than I did before; I'm not throwing a wrench into my entire perception of reality every couple of hours. I'm being more productive; mostly because it's no longer gratifying to just do nothing. I'm more comfortable around other people; I don't feel like I am hiding anything, walking on eggshells, or avoiding eye-contact. I'm smiling more. 

Some things haven't changed however. I still want to smoke. Sometimes so badly that I have to call someone to prevent myself from slipping back. I'm still afraid of the future. I don't necessarily like my life anymore than I did before I started using; I still have the same complaints. Some days are really easy and peaceful, and some days are chaotic and miserable. Some days my body feels good, other days I feel like I am an old man who is physically failing. Quitting really hasn't been the cure-all that I unrealistically hoped it would be. 

Despite the negatives, the first time in a long time I would say that I have some hope for the future. I feel honest again and I'm actually capable of placing my focus on my spiritual growth. I'm starting to see that by staying clean I will eventually be able to change all those undesirable things about my life that drove me to smoking. I don't need to be miserable forever; smoking made me comfortable with the status quo and fearful of change, even when the status quo was the source of my pain. 

I really don't know what the future holds, and I may smoke again; I still have the desire in my heart. But I didn't smoke today. If you are serious about getting out from under this habit than you are in the right place; follow the advice on this board and reach out for help if you aren't strong enough to do it yourself. I found that when I asked one person for help, I found ten willing. Thanks /r/leaves; what I couldn't do alone we can accomplish together. 

**TLDR:** It hasn't been easy, but so far it's been worth it. I couldn't do it myself, but with the help of you guys and others, I've been able to stay clean for longer than I have in years.

Its week 3.  I havent smoked any bud.  Ive been around it and damn the temptation is strong, but I just walk away and focus on something else.  I wish I could say Ive stayed off drinking, but I havent.  Havent gotten drunk, or even tipsy.  Ill have a beer with friends or a glass of wine but never ever am I drinking alone or drinking when others are not.  I also have smoked a couple cigs but that was after some amazing sex so that I feel is kind of justified, am not really tempted to do any more.  

Physically my lungs are a hell of a lot better.  I am skating longer and harder with less want to be all huff and puff after.  Its more of a slow hard breathing.  Also I am much more in tune with my body as compared even to week 2.  I can feel everything much better (or worse cause my wrist with tendinitis loves to flare up even when writing so I have a brace on it most of the time)  My throat is almost completely 'healed' and It only really hurts if I chug a lot of carbonated liquid (soda/beer) or have acidic/spicy food.  Otherwise I feel great.

Mentally my mind is a shit ton clearer.  I am able to remember much easier, formulate plans much better, read people at a better level, and am really just more awake.  The mental fuzz is practicly gone.  SO THERE IS HOPE OUT THERE TO ALL THOSE WONDERING.  YOUR MIND WILL CLEAR UP!  I cannot say that my paitainence is much better, but hey, thats more or less just me, either i like you or i greatly dislike you.  If its someone I like, I have a much higher tolerance for their stupidity.  Uhmm....what else.  Things that I used to do high or really enjoy high are coming back to their once awesome awesomeness (wtf does that mean?)  Music is just as fun as it was high, so bands like ratatat and pretty lights I am able to listen to again (for the most part) without wanting to light up.

Things I have noticed is.  The classes I am in currently are 3hour long classes (Brutal on the mind leaves me wiped out but content) and we of course get breaks through the classes.  This is when I would normally either ditch the class, run back and smoke, or smoke a cig.  Now the second I get a break I am running outside with my board and skating around for 5-10mins.  This is a great feeling cause I come back with more energy and much happier and I can feel it too.  I am being much more active in general and much happier.  

***TLDR Summary:***

Mental fog lifted

Reflexes, thinking, all that is much quicker and clearer

Happier for longer periods of time as compared to on weed

Paitence still low, but getting better with friends, if I dont like you, i will just walk away

Still tempted if I am around it and smell it but I walk away 

Drinking only socaily but never much (Most Ive had in one sitting is two beers)

During breaks and down time I am skating and keeping my self physically active (unless I am playing games)

Noticing the world around me in a much better clearer cleaner light and am in love with it.  

Life is fucking good.  Loving it.

Uhh thats a very quick summary...I wish I had more time but I legit have 1hr between classes and would love to eat and what not so I may or may not come back and edit this to a more proper more detailed post (leaning on prob not)

Peace and Respect,
J.

***PS.*** to all those just starting, keep it up!  It sucks believe us we know (hope leaves doesnt mind me using us as a collective supportive being), but the feeling even now just a couple of weeks after going clean tops anything weed ever did!  Keep ya chins up and believe in yourself!  And when shit gets you down fucking punch it in the face and use it as a step ladder to get back up. You got this!  If ya ever need support just hit leaves up!  We got your back at any time.  Heres to being clean!

TL;DNR summary at bottom.

   A friend showed me this and I figured this is where I will start my own journey/journal of quitting weed.  Ive been smoking for about 5 years (I've never seen that written and that scares me) and I just don't want to do it anymore.  I smoke constantly and as a result I am constantly high.  I would wake up in the morning and smoke a joint before I got out of bed, and I would, no...I do, smoke every chance I can.  It even got bad enough for me to leave friends and parties to go back to my place to smoke (alone) so I could continue my high.  It is rare for me to be sober and I hate that, it scares me and makes me so disappointed with myself.  It's affecting my school and grades, but worst of all its affecting me physically.  And I always promised myself I would quit the second it began hurt me physically, well...I am spitting bloody mucus in the morning, not every morning, but if I smoke hard (which is what I ususally do) I will wake up in severe pain and then spit blood.  It doesn't last all day usually Ill spit a couple times then drink some water and I am fine but, its scaring me, and this has been going on for a couple weeks.  I couldnt run a block if i wanted to.  I need to quit weed, I am tired of letting it destroy me.  I don't want to use the term addict, but I feel thats what I am.  I don't even notice myself smoking or hitting up my 'friend' when I am low or out of weed (Even when I am trying to quit).  I just, I want to quit.  Ive hidden my stuff from me (because if I find it, I will smoke the resin, I will smoke anything I can), ive dumped all my weed, Ive deleted my 'friend' contacts, im done.  With that being said....I need help advice anything....

   Maybe a little background on why I smoke.  First reason I would give is my anxiety and my PTSD.  Short story, I was the victim of child porn (Helped send the fucker to jail though, payback is sweet). Weed just makes me feel alright, you know.  Another reason I smoke is cause it helps sleep, appitite (I rarely eat without being high), and my add.  Its also become such a part of who I am.  People know me for weed, for my stonerness, for just being high....(that sickens me too, I know they love me for me but the weed is just a huge part) But really I guess I smoke because I just don't want to deal with life. 

   So what helps quit?  What advice is out there??  What helps with the anxiety, or the 'want' to smoke?  How can i deal with the everyday situations I used to do high?  How can I eat?  

   I plan on keeping a journal type deal and posting everyday here till I am clean for at least 2months(ill probably stick around).  And I am going to meet with my therapist (to help myslef control the PTSD without weed).  But what else, Ive never gone cold turkey or quit because I wanted to (I have done brief 'quit stints' to pass drug tests but as soon as i found out i could smoke, you better believe i would smoke a fat bag). 

   Please, I'm out of places to go, my friends can only help me so much, but they dont know weed like stoners do nor what it is doing to me....

   I've read some of the other posts and I am actually crying right now.  I feel like with this place, I may just be able to quit for good. 




TL;DNR summary
Smoking for 5 years.

Smoked for fun, then to control ptsd (from childhood trauma), sleep, but now because I can't stop.

I am scared for my physical health. I spit bloody mucus/chest hurts in the morning, breathing sucks.

I want to quit, I am ready to quit, I just don't know how.

Help....please.

I've always managed to perform well at work/school, and thanks to the constant practice I'm functional socially as well. At the same time, I've been wondering if the pot has been hampering my potential, and wanted to go without for an extended period and see what happens.

The adjustment is going well so far; I'm pretty busy with school/family/pets etc to think about it most of the time. It's during these late nights that I used to smoke the most, though, so I'm thinking about it now. It's pretty strange not being 'subdued', for lack of a better word.

Anyways, the thought occurred to me how odd it is, and will be, not being stoned for most of the day. The thought came out as ""it's weird being sober all the time"", which made me laugh, as I've had a couple beers while working tonight. This is two beers over the past 5 hours, so I'm far from buzzed, but the thought elicited a chuckle nonetheless.

I've been lurking on leaves for a couple weeks now, and realize that many people are having a much rougher go at it then I am, and wish all of you the best. I'm not looking for replies, but feel free if you'd like to commiserate.

1313775138.0,25,self.leaves,jo1wp,Warning: This is long and perhaps familiar.,throwMJaway,30,5,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/jo1wp/warning_this_is_long_and_perhaps_familiar/,"*I wrote this to myself about a year ago. Though I was fairly depressed at the time, I feel worlds better now, and I see this letter as one of the mental  “growth-spurts” that has helped lead me to closer the state of inner balance I’ve been working to achieve. Maybe it will help you. Maybe you’ll take comfort in finding a little bit of yourself in here. Who knows?*

**The Letter:**

Saying I over-think things is an understatement.

Take my happiness, for example. I think about it so much, it makes me unhappy. Such a vicious cycle. 

It goes something like this: 

I know I was happy at some point in high school…and definitely earlier. I remember sitting in my parents’ den, in front of the computer, thinking about how if I died the next day I would die a happy person. Is that one fleeting memory that my currently unhappy self is clinging to? I know I wasn’t happy all the time in high school. I remember crying because I was ugly, because I didn’t have enough friends, because I didn’t do well on a test or in some class. I fought with my mother. But I was comfortable. I didn’t worry about money or politics or my place in the world. 

But now? Now, I don’t know. I’m married. I own a house… well… part of a house anyway. I have a career, one that pays me far more than I deserve. And sometimes I feel like a failure. I feel like I was happier before. When I was in high school, confident in my popularity, top of my class, good at everything I tried. And in the first few years in my first career – again, confident in my abilities, liked by my peers, going somewhere. 

But what happened? 

Is it the world? Becoming an adult and realizing that the world is a terrible, unjust, unfair place? That hard work doesn’t really mean success? That successful people rarely get there because they deserve it? Feeling like everything is broken (the government, healthcare, crime, the economy, real estate, wall street) and that there’s nothing I can do about it. Is it me? Are these just part of the pains of becoming an adult? Realizing I’m not a kid anymore, that my life is essentially meaningless, that I’ll never make history. 

Or, the 25 million dollar question: Can I blame all of this on MJ? Did it make me lazier? Did it make me more cynical, more aware, easier to depress? More… thoughtful? Honestly, I’m not sure.

And there I go, thinking on something that thinking can’t solve. If I’m unhappy, I should figure out what I need to be happy and DO it. Or I should quit whining, go with the flow and remind myself that I have a great life. I’m mostly healthy, I love my family and I’m not poor. That makes me better off than 99% of the planet. Today, I’m opting for the later, less whiny path. But tomorrow or the next day, I’ll go through the same mental marathon again.

Which brings us back to that 25 million dollar question: What about the MJ? How does it fit into this thoughtful picture? This year I will be 30. Though I’ve done a lot of fun things in the past few years, I can’t help but feel like I’ve been clouding those memories with smoke. 

There’s something wonderful about smoking. It’s like I get to hit pause on all my worries… sometimes. Sometimes, instead of sweet release I end up with crippling paranoia, but for the most part, smoking lets me relax, enjoy the sky, the world around me. They say you should stop and smell the roses. Smoking lets me do that. For a price. 

It seems my genes are not those of an addict but an over-indulger. Quitting is physically easy. I’ve done it off an on for the last few years. Then again, all addicts think they can quit at any time. They just need a good enough reason – the famous 'rock bottom.' But I’ll never hit rock bottom smoking. There’s no bottom to hit. Beyond this intense inner monologue – something I’m pretty sure I always had, but smoking enhances – it doesn’t really have any negative effects on my life. Or does it.  

Thinking thinking thinking. Even if it’s not caused by smoking, it’s not made any better by smoking. Perhaps the bigger concern is that it gives me one more thing to think about.

I think about smoking all the time. When I’m relaxed I think, ‘smoking would make this better.’ When I’m bored I think, ‘smoking would make this better.’ When I’m unhappy I think, ‘smoking would make this better.’ But all smoking does is give me an hour or two of mush brain followed by cravings to consume anything within reach. Is that really so great?  

And yet, here I am thinking about how I’d love to leave work and go sit in the hammock for a few hours just looking at the clouds. Sure, that’s not a bad thing. But it is when you do it every day. When you let the house go to pot, you stop hanging out with your friends and forget your sister’s birthday. THEN, it’s a problem. And yet…besides the fact that having a clean house makes me happier to be there, what’s it matter? So what if I have a dirty house? I have nothing to smoke tonight, but I still don’t want to hang out with Claire. And I probably would have forgotten my sister’s birthday anyway. 

The truth lies somewhere between thinking the drug has no effect on me and blaming it for all my problems. But where? Damned if I know. 

I like smoking. There have been high times in the past few years that I would add to my lifetime collection: watching the sunsets, the planes, the moon from my hammock, my oasis. Wandering around my parent’s old yard, reminiscing on my childhood. Walking to the library, watching the sun glint off the ocean. Kayaking back to the cabin house with my husband. Having spacey discussions with him under the stars. 

I’m almost in tears thinking of how wonderful smoking can be… but what a fiend it makes me! I smoke all weekend and end up dangerously depressed on Monday (because I NEVER smoke before or at work). I smoke before visiting friends who may or may not notice that I’m not playing with a full deck. I think about it all the time when I’m trying to cut back. 

And my husband doesn’t like it. I don’t want him to be disappointed in me or angry at me. But, at the same time, I can’t help but feel that smoking makes me more like him. Unconcerned with minor chores, able to just go with the flow and be happy in the moment. But if I’m not the driven one in our relationship… Someone has to be at the theoretical wheel, and I can’t be when I’m high.

So why should I quit? I might not get any real benefit from smoking…but I guess you could say the same about video games. Can I honestly only smoke when I have nothing better to do? I’m not sure. But if the house is dirty? Smoking will make it more fun to clean! If I have things I need to get done? I’ll get them done and reward myself with a little ‘fresh air’! 

Round and round we go. 

One side reminds me that I’m trading tomorrow for today and my future for right now. I won’t get healthy or end the paranoid thinking if I don’t stop. I’ve already proven to myself that I can’t have it and not smoke it. If you’re going to quit, there’s no time like the present.

Then the other side rationalizes that the end is near, that we’ll go grocery shopping tonight and then pay my “friend” a visit, but this will be it; then I’ll take a break. The winter is coming and I hate being out in the cold. So it will be easier. I’m really only smoking until daylight savings, when it’s too dark to go out anyway. Just one more month and then I’m through.

But I said that last time.

Nothing makes me smile more than the smell of a freshly ground-up bud.  It makes movies, music, sex better.  All of this is well-documented.

But I’ve gone from enjoying it a few times a month on the weekends to roasting bowls every night.  I’ve blown off going to lame movies with friends so I could get back home and toke.  I’ve more or less stopped working out in lieu of sitting in front of my computer, watching youtube and destroying munchies by the metric ton.  I’m usually focused on it as soon as the work day is over, and think about that first bowl all the way home until I’m safely toasted again.

My life is going well—my job is awesome and I’m appreciated there for all the hard work I do, my wife loves me very much, and I don’t blow off (many) responsibilities because of pot.  The bills are all paid and the apartment is clean.  But I just feel too cloudy these days, and I’ve gone from very articulate and quick-on-my-feet mentally to sluggish and spacey in my thoughts.  I feel like people can tell my head is clogged with resin, and it makes me less confident when talking to other people, especially higher-ups at work.  And I start to obsess about how I shouldn’t smoke so much as soon as I get high (though I seldom have that feeling when I’m sober, and especially not when smoke time nears).

So, today I’m starting a two week break.  I’m hoping beyond hope that I can get this shit under control, and exercise enough self-restraint and cut my smoking down.  Actually, it’s not self-restraint I want—it’s to just not obsess about weed all the time, to be able to go “oh, hey, I haven’t smoked in awhile and I’ve got nothing going on tonight.  Maybe I’ll have a bit and watch The Big Lebowski before bed.”  The way I think most people who smoke casually do.

Anyway, wish me luck on my two weeks.  Longest I’ve gone in the last year is probably 5 days, and that was only because I was on vacation.  I’m hoping that airing this publicly here and telling my wife my plans will solidify the commitment for me.  I guess if I fail here I know that it's gone past obsession to addiction, and I'll need to look seriously at quitting.  My dad smoked for 35+ years, so to some extent I'm fighting against biology and my genetic predisposition towards addiction.

To do that, though, I should probably start with how I began smoking trees.

To make a long story short, I hang out with a bunch of losers in highschool.  Well, not really losers, just the generally misunderstood, highly intelligent, introverted, but also very geeky people in highschool.  Middle class suburban kids, some of whom were more ""indie.""  

We weren't as a collective, uncool, we just were the ""floaters;"" you know, the people who are quasi-friends with everyone people. Also known as ""don't give a fuck.""  Naturally, smoking weed was the norm.

It took a great amount of time/independent research of my own to conclude that I wanted to smoke weed for the first time.  And smoke I did.  For the many months and years that followed, I toked up daily.

Nothing seemed to happen.  I kept my friends, my job, and my own identity--at least that is how it appeared on the outside.  After many years of doing this, and smoking later in college, I was falling behind in school and so too were my friends.  I became lazy, unmotivated, and desired nothing but what would make me immediately happy, even if there were significant long-term (but largely unnoticeable in the short-term) costs.

Marijuana made me patient for trivial matters, but also those of importance.  As long as I had marijuana, most everything else could be delayed. 

**Fast Forward**

Today, I'm the only one in still in college of the eight of my friends who went to school with me.  I work forty hours a week, and have maintained a 4.0 GPA since I quit smoking.  I have been an absolute success, and will not at all hide my own ego in saying so.  **It has been, for me, a 180-degree reversal.**

My friends however have all fell to low-paying, minimum-wage food preparation jobs in fast food and now (mostly) all live together in a single house, where they all smoke daily.  They drink, as well, though that's a pretty new development.  

Between four people, I believe, there are at least 3 DUIs and numerous possession/paraphernalia charges, and not a *glimmer of hope for any one of them*.  Opportunities abandoned all-around, their impulsivity (a trait none had before smoking) is a deterrent to any real improvement.

**There is one very distinct difference between my friends and I.**  I quit without my friends, my friends continue smoking with my friends.  They are no longer the people they once were, slowly losing their minds, and frankly, I am surprised that one is even still capable of breathing.  

I quit when, after a period of many years, I had enough.  I stopped answering my friends phone calls and I spent many nights by myself.  Pleasurable? No, but it set the stage for a ""new me.""

I ignored those who I considered my best of buds (no pun intended), and today I would consider them nothing more than acquaintances.  **At first it was difficult to separate myself from my friends, but in retrospect, it was a far easier path than to lose all potential.**

In the one year that has followed, they have asked many times what happened to the friendship.  I must confess, albeit only to myself, that I cannot afford such friends.

**Final Thoughts**

I hate to say it, but there is absolutely no way to beat the odds.  You are a product of those with whom you acquaint, and so too is your decision-making process.  To believe any differently is pure naivety.

And I should comment, also, that the biggest danger of marijuana is not its inherent danger.  No, marijuana will not kill you.  It does, however, have a very large impact on your state of mind, your energy levels, and any desire to improve yourself.  **The biggest danger, I believe, is its perceived lack of danger.**

The biggest risk is that you lose dreams,  or ambitions because you kill the time you would normally dedicate to them.

This isn't, however, an actual loss and is easily ignored when you're addicted/engaged in repetition/whatever.  You've only lost what you could have been.  You cannot see this or touch it.  Nor can you know that you have lost it, nor what may have come as a result of taking that first step.

You see, when I quit smoking, I began to see the million-mile journey that would follow the first step, and earned back a very driven state of mind that I  had not seen since my teens.  When I smoked, I saw only the barriers to the first step, ignoring the benefits of the path that followed.

Do not, under any circumstances, think shutting your friends off is the wrong thing to do.  Your friends are your environment.  A toxic environment is a toxic you.  A healthy environment is a healthy you.

If you really want to quit smoking weed, you will have to quit your friends.  That is, unfortunately, the very first step.  However, it does begin the million mile journey that lies ahead.

I don't really think it's that big of a deal.  Lots of dreams is the only real significant change.  I'm bored today, but if I was still getting high I'd just be high and bored.

The reasons I have for staying clean are more important than getting high.  I do sort of wish things were different in life and society, that I had enough money and freedom to get high whenever I wanted to.

But, it's not that big of a deal.  I need to be able to take an honest look at my employment circumstances and get myself out on the market without worrying about cheating on a UA.

I thought maybe we could offer some encouragement to the newcomers.  We keep telling them to ""hang in there,"" but we should give them some evidence to show why it is worth it.  So without further ado:

1. How many days since you have gotten high, if you are keeping count?

2. Do you wonder how you ever had the time to get high?

3. Do you wonder how you ever had the money to get high?

4. How much money are you saving a month by not buying weed?

5. How many miles are you saving on your car not driving around to buy/pickup weed?

6. Do you still see your smoking buds?

7. Has your job performance improved, gotten worse or stayed the same?

8. Have your personal relationships improved or gotten worse or remained the same with your family, your SO, your kids, other friends?

9. Are you generally happier now?

10. How often do you run into temptation?

1. 284

2. Yes.  I rarely have spare time anymore.

3. I have no idea how I kept finding the money.

4. About $160-$200

5. I was driving at least 16 miles a week to hit the atm, drop off money, then come back in a couple days for the weed.  (Went through a friend that had a dealer.)  Then add in about 10 miles a week for burn rides.

6. Yes, but they don't smoke in front of me.  

7. I realize now how much I was slacking off at work. Getting more done, getting more recognition. 

8. Improved on  all fronts.  I am way more present and honest, and less distracted. 

9. Yes.  

10. Couple of times a month I run into a former smoking situation. Other than that, I think of weed a lot. It shows up on TV, the news, movies, morning radio shows, etc.

""I'll only bum cigarettes"" is exactly the same as ""I'll only smoke with my sister-in-law.""

I smoked cigarettes because I loved them. I smoked pot because I loved it. I'll always love them both. But they don't love me back.

Just as it's still work 8 years later to not smoke cigarettes, it will always be work to not smoke pot. I can't cheat, I can't trick myself into thinking once won't hurt. I have to keep being someone who doesn't smoke pot. ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1b6ep1,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1b6ep1/17_weeks_119_days/,

Those were the posts that were so helpful to me in my first few days. 

Remind: 22 year old male. Wake-and-baker for 3 years, literally from the first time I ever touched the stuff. Ten bowls a day, a few blunts, occasional bong hits. I got high more than I was high, I think; constantly re-upping rather than riding it out. 

Got into my dream MFA program and threw away roughly a half (flushed that shit down the toilet) and broke my pieces exactly two weeks ago today. 

The first few days were total hell. Anxiety, restlessness to the point of mania (preexisting manic depressive tendencies rising to the surface), no appetite whatsoever, irritability, headaches, you name it. 

While this is certainly not a catch-all for all tokers, I know I was using marijuana to mask my own mental illness from the beginning, which complicates the detox process. I got back on medication (Prozac for the long term; Xanax as needed for the short term, which I've proudly been using sparingly) ten days ago, and that seems to have helped just a bit. 

But no bones about it: this process sucks. I feel like my head weighs a million pounds and also is light as a feather. Interrupted sleep—waking up in the middle of the night sweating, nightmares, difficulty falling asleep, etc. No cravings for weed still, which is a plus, and indicative of how much I want to be beyond this. 

Things that have helped: exercise, fruit smoothies, cutting back on cigarettes (quitting is preferable, I know, but one thing at a time), two showers a day, herbal tea, incense, journaling when possible. 

I'm also getting acupuncture today; will report back on how that goes. Suspicious of it, but trying to keep an open mind.

My question to those further along in this process than I: how long 'til this fog lifts? That's the most difficult part about the process, at least for me, is feeling like I'm still high without any of the buzz. Foggy head, somewhat drowsy, slothlike. I do my best to fight it, but I really do feel like my head is in the cloud still.

1363703748.0,22,self.leaves,1ale8g,Lurking No More- My Reasons for Quitting,LatKava,27,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1ale8g/lurking_no_more_my_reasons_for_quitting/,"Greetings Leaves, 

First I want to share how excited I was to find r/leaves- as all of you have experienced, finding a support group for quitting that doesn't consist mainly of ridiculous anti-trees propaganda is a tough quest.  I've felt the internal conflict between the two parts of me that are on opposite sides of this issue:  One side knows that trees are great, can be medicinal/therapeutic/just plain fun.  The other side of me recognizes how much difficulty I have in moderating my use, and how even pretty moderate use has come to have effects in my life that I don't appreciate.  This dichotomy is, in my opinion, one thing that makes it so tough to completely quit smoking.  Unlike, say, a heroin user, who (try as he might) can't really justify heroin as a mostly harmless/potentially helpful substance, whenever I get down on myself for smoking when I was trying not to, it's so easy to say, ""eh fuck it, it's medicinal/harmless/non-addictive/etc., one more puff won't hurt!""  I realize this line of thought has the potential to drift towards 1st world problems status, in a ""Marijuana is so harmless and fun and non-addictive that I just can't quit, poor me"" type of way- and I want to avoid that.  My point is to relate to the struggle that all leaves face- weed is mostly good/mostly not that bad, just not for me at this point in my life.  

Having said all of that, I guess I'd like to write about my reasons for feeling like I need to quit smoking.  These reasons have been floating around in my head (in the midst of a marijuana mist, usually) for a long time, and, like many of you have probably experienced, tend to crystalize most strongly in the morning after waking up from a trees-induced coma.  So, I'd like to capture these thoughts while they're still strong, because, as many of you have probably also experienced, those thoughts of quitting seem to shrivel up and fly away by mid-afternoon, and then it's on to the next bowl pack, my feelings of a few hours prior be damned!  

I'll start with the experience of smoking itself:  When I first started smoking about 6 years ago, getting high was *awesome*.  Trees turned my brain on, opened it up, and set it free.  I could think creatively, reason through problems in novel ways, was more talkative, more adventurous, more social.  I wanted to get high and go DO and SEE and EXPERIENCE!  I felt more aware of my emotions, and more in touch with the memories/events/people/interactions that caused them. Sure, I also spent plenty of nights smoking with my buddies and sitting around watching TV, but even that was a positive experience as we would often smoke and have long discussions about our family history or experiences from childhood that we felt were formative in some way, debates about social issues, etc.  Sure, weed made me sleepy sometimes too, but it was rare, and when it happened I welcomed it because the sleep was so. damn. good.  

Fast forward a few years, and I often find myself questioning, within minutes of smoking, why I felt like I needed to smoke in the first place.  These days, from the 1st puff my brain feels foggy and slow, my emotions feel dulled and flat, colors and sounds seem muted, I have trouble maintaining a singular line of thought, and I lose interest in almost every sort of activity.  I don't have the physical energy to want to do the things that I love to do (as an endurance athlete from a young age all the way through college, physical fitness is a central building block of my life, so this is a big deal to me).  I don't have the emotional or mental energy to want to engage on any meaningful level with anyone around me.  I don't have the focus or motivation to get any type of productive task that requires much thinking done (sure I can get high as fuck and clean my room, which is nice and all, but hardly the height of productivity when viewed in comparison with, say, developing or enhancing a set of skills to further my career).  

I've found that these problems manifest themselves almost completely regardless of to what extent I'm able to moderate my smoking.  For years I've gone back and forth through phases of trying to moderate my smoking, saying ""smoking's not bad, it's just that I do it too much"" or ""it's just that I smoke too early in the day"" or ""it's just that I smoke too many days a week.""  I've never really been successful at self-moderation to the point of being able to only smoke on weekends, or only smoke once a week.  There have been times (like the past few weeks), however, when I've been able to only smoke 1-2x/day, or only smoke after a certain point in the afternoon.  I've found that even this level of moderation isn't really helpful to me.  If I plan on not smoking until 4:20 (how cliche, right?) or not smoking until just before dinner, I can usually (sometimes) succeed.  But, the above-mentioned negative effects still take place, only later in the day.  Also, I find that everything that happens before trees'o'clock on any given day is colored by a few brush strokes of ""I'm getting through this until I get to smoke later.""  This is a terrible way to live, and makes all the things that happen before smoke-time much less enjoyable than they should be.  I also find that I will still have no control over the food I put in my body once I'm high.  Now, I realize that eating a piece of candy isn't the end of the world, but a huge part of my self-concept revolves around being an athlete and caring about my body.  You can imagine the cognitive dissonance I've been putting myself through almost daily, then, when I wake up and look back on the 4 bowls of ice cream, 3 butter and sugar sandwiches, 2 packs of sour gummy candy, and large pizza that I ate the night before.  Eating like that does not align with either my self-identity or my goals, but when I smoke, it's basically a foregone conclusion that this is what will happen.  Moderating my smoking to only later in the day also maintains my reliance on trees to sleep well, which is another huge negative for me- I hate NEEDING something to be able to sleep. 

So, now I've gone through the (mostly) physical effects of smoking.  Now I'd like to write a little about what I perceive to be the emotional results.  A lot of you guys and gals have written about using trees as an escape mechanism, a way to avoid dealing with your problems, and that is definitely the case for me.  Not in the sense that I have terrible underlying depression, or severe social anxiety, or anything like that.  On the whole I'm a pretty well-adjusted, healthy, happy individual, so I'm not using pot to hide from the terrible demons lurking in my closet.  What I find instead is that smoking daily has provided a consistent buffer between me as a conscious being, and my emotions.  So whether the emotions are positive, negative, or neutral, they're always viewed from a protected perch, high above (pun intended, I suppose) the emotional hubbub.  As though I'm only approaching my emotions with a riot shield made of trees between us.  The end result of this is that when these emotions occur and I'm not baked, they are scary, overwhelming, unfamiliar, and difficult to interpret and act upon.  This is disconcerting, of course, and leads to a prompt retreat back up to the perch, behind the riot shield, where, aaaah things feel like they have a warm, wet blanket over them, isn't that nice?  

This issue, to me, is one of vastly greater importance than any of the other, perhaps more tangible reasons for quitting.  ""I don't get as much stuff done"" pales in comparison to ""I can't recognize or accurately and effectively process my own emotions.""  This has endless potential ramifications in life, ranging from ""I felt unsatisfied with my life, so I dumped my girlfriend of 5 years.  Oh shit, was I unsatisfied with her, or was I unsatisfied because I get high too much and know that I'm squandering a large percentage of my potential.  Fuck, what have I done?"" to ""I'm frustrated with my poor performance.  I'll get high rather than experience and feel that frustration as I should, which would lead to actual motivation to make changes so I can perform better next time.""  I'm beginning to see the potential that trees have, then, to allow me (I say allow, rather than cause, because I want to emphasize that I recognize that some people don't have this issue) to stagnate in life, whether it's complete stagnation or 5% stagnation doesn't matter- I want to move forward and upwards in life, whatever that may mean to me, rather than sitting still or going backwards.  

I recognize that I have unbelievable potential, and that I'm damn lucky to live in an age and a place where I have all the tools and opportunities at my disposal with which to achieve that potential.  I can be and do so much, for myself and for other people.  Above all, I have the capacity to be as healthy as I want to be, as productive as I want to be, and as happy as I want to be.  As of right now, burning trees is holding me back in all three of those areas, and yet, until now, I haven't been able to say no for any significant period of time.  I just got back from a business trip where I didn't have trees for 6 days.  Those 6 days were pretty crappy in some ways (difficulty falling asleep, night sweats), but pretty great in other ways.  Feeling the fog lifted, having tons of energy without drinking a full pot of coffee in the morning, and having access to my entire vocabulary on demand were all definitive perks.  This 6 days gave me a glimpse into what life without trees can be like, and I liked it.  Of course, when I got back to my house with roommates who all smoke, I fell back into the moderation trap- ""OK a week off, and now I'll only take 1 hit a day, just to chill out and enjoy dinner...""  Suuuure.   3-4 days later and I'm smoking multiple times a day and buying half the candy aisle in the gas station down the street every night. 

These, dear Leaves, are my reasons and reasoning for quitting trees.  I realize that none of them are unique or novel in any way, and they have all been experienced by thousands of former smokers who for one reason or another, decided smoking wasn't for them.  I am now one of those smokers.  If you've made it this far in my manifesto, thanks for reading, and I hope that my sharing will help at least one other person who is struggling with this issue.  I'll try to update soon,

But wtf am I going to do? I'm in the middle of a semester and I can't just leave. I am aware that it ""gets better"" but does it? I have to live with the choices I've made and I don't know if I can do it. And when I get through 4 months what then? I am not strong enough to stay away. I will go running right back, my Stockholm syndrome. Weed made me drop out of a university I love and now I'm living at home going to a decent university but by no means where I was, weed has made me loose jobs and friends, alienate family, spend TONS of money, get out of shape, made my hobbies and interests fade into nothingness.

When I'm high the night before swear to myself I won't crack, and always do.
I don't even want to quit forever, which might be one reason. I just want to live a normal life, be able to go through my day without smoking, and smoke at night sometimes to relax or recreationally. 

Why do I want to cut back? 1. feel like i've wasted my youth, could've accomplished and experienced so much more (university sports, post grad school, more girls) 1. i'm clearly cripplingly addicted 2. i want to start working out again 3. don't want to be blazed out of mind middle of the day, too high to go out and talk to ppl and do activities or even answer the phone for an important call

Additional obstacles: 1. live with extreme potheads that just watch tv all day 2. have a constant supply of green

You folks are inspirational, honest, and deeply human, and those three things are rarely found in a single source.  So, thank you.

I'll save you the autobiography, suffice to say that, like many others, I've been a heavy smoker for a while, but my roommates and my partner of several years smoke and have fewer (existential or practical) problems with it than I feel I do.  My end goal is to quit, but because it's a huge part of my environment, my plan is to phase out gradually by greatly reducing my intake and to be very conscious of and deliberate with any use I do engage in.

So, that being said, let's agree that we all know that weed kills your dreams.  They either literally go away making sleep much less content-rich, or weed makes the recall of dreams almost impossible.  What I've noticed, is that even with a single day of abstinence, my dreams will come back in full force.  The dreams are great, often insightful, and I actually enjoy them quite a bit, but often the next day I'll find myself consumed by emotions evoked by the dreaming experiences.  When I'm smoking, I generally feel like I'm on a pretty even emotional keel with the biggest influence being simple fatigue, but when I'm not smoking I feel like I'm much less consistent emotionally.  This goes especially when the dreams are deeply personally related to my primary relationship, the future, ex-girlfriends, and those kinds of things.

Have any of you had similar experiences?  I'd love to hear about them.  If so, how'd you go about restabilizing yourself?  Any insight as to whether this emotional randomness is just a normal part of the sober human experience or whether it is just, you know, dreams coming back with a vengeance after a long period of neurochemical repression?

My friends and I have always been incredibly close. There's a group of four of us who have been best friends since 3rd grade. We even played our first talent show together in 6th grade and kept a band together all through high school, when we put out an EP. The other guys all started smoking around 9th grade, but I didn't, and that was totally fine. I hung out with them all the time still. People were really surprised all through high school when they found out I didn't smoke, since I was the singer and guitarist in the band of the biggest stoners at school. 

The reason I started smoking was pretty silly, actually, especially when you consider the fact that I'd been hanging around with these guys while they smoked constantly for three years. It was the summer before senior year of high school, and this girl across the street from me was having a party. At the time, all my friends pretty much lived at my house, so once the party across the street was over, my three best friends/bandmates, my girlfriend and I all went back to my house. When we got there, my girlfriend and I were about to go upstairs and my friends said they were gonna stay outside and smoke real quick. Seemingly out of nowhere, my girlfriend said she wanted to smoke, too. I guess being a somewhat jealous and insecure type as well—I wasn't going to pussy out and go inside alone while my girlfriend smoked with my best friends—I decided to partake as well. A lot of people say they don't get high their first time...not me. I had been smoking cigarettes for a year or two, so I certainly knew how to inhale, and I'd been seeing my friends smoke for years. I got so high that night I didn't even know what was going on. When I was hooking up with my girlfriend later, I didn't even know if I had come, I felt so weird. 

I distinctly remember not having that pleasant of a time the first time. Everything seemed to be pulsing. It was so intense. Too intense. But when I said this to my friends, they insisted I had to try it again. And so over the course of a few weeks, I would just get high as all fuck. Remember I said that my friends were the biggest stoners in school? Well, since I already hung around them all the time, I sort of got fast-tracked up to their level within a few weeks. That year was probably the best time of my life. We were the best of friends, I was together with my girlfriend, and well all just hung out, smoked, and played music pretty much all day for a year. School was a joke for me, and I got a 35 on the ACT, National Merit Scholar, and accepted to a good school on a full ride. There really were no worries. We'd all meet up in the morning, smoke before school, then meet up to smoke again at lunch, and then go to our drummer's house everyday and smoke and play music until his parents told us to go home. I was the first to leave for school that summer, and I remember we all smoked so much that we were just laughing and crying hysterically all night, not wanting to leave because that would really be the end. 

I went down to school and knew nobody. I decided that since I'd been smoking a half eighth or so everyday for a year, I would give the whole not smoking thing a shot, which was easy to do since I could not have even found weed if I wanted it. Within a month or so, though, I had made some friends and started smoking wit them again. This was the time when my smoking was at its healthiest. Over the next two years, my smoking went up and down, but it really was never a problem. I went abroad for a year, and for the first three months or so, I only smoked two or three times because I didn't know where to get it. 

I should probably backtrack a bit here. In high school, I had been the wittiest and smartest kid. I got girls like no problem. Teachers and parents and everyone else just loved me. Smoking gave me social anxiety, as I now recognize. At every party I went to starting in college pretty much, I was really just going through the motions until I could get out of there and go smoke weed. Well, when I quit for those three or four months when I first went abroad, it all came back. Depression, anxiety, being fat, lazy and lethargic, all that went away. I was back on top. And it lasted for a long time. Until I found out about the sketchy drug dealers under the bridge. 

I was with a friend and weed came up, and I said I'd be down to smoke. So we went over to this bridge near the train station, approached these sketchy foreigners, and bought hash from them. Once I realized that I could do this anytime I wanted, I started smoking every day again. I got lazy and anxious again, and my wit and charm and all that gradually dissipated. I got back to the states where good weed was once again easy to find, and smoked everyday since I've been back. 

I figure that I'm at around 11-12 months since I went a day without smoking. I certainly haven't slept without weed in that time period. Honestly, it's not even getting high that gets in the way for me. It's the residual effects on my brain, the way it takes the edge off me. It makes me less clever, less witty, less willing to go out and do stuff. Because it's not like I ever got high and didn't go to class, or sat around all day smoking. But I might as well have, because I put my brain in this weed cycle; the best part of every day was around 9 or 10 o'clock at night when I would smoke.  

This week I have some serious shit I need to get done, and I haven't been getting it done. So last night I decided it was it. I took my pipe and cleaned it with alcohol and salt to make it brand new—no resin to pitifully scrape if I gave in. I had enough weed for three fat joints. I rolled them up and went out to my usual smokespot. My plan was to sort of ritualistically smoke these huge fatties—way, way more weed than I usual smoke in a sitting. But I thought that I would smoke all this stuff in a big gesture, and then I'd be done with it. I was driving to my spot, and something came over me...I just threw two of the joints out the window. Which was fine, because given the size of the joint I still had, I probably couldn't have gotten any higher anyway. So I smoked this joint, chilled for a bit, and then drove back. Strangely, being high gives me a bit of clarity, in the sense that when I'm high, I realize that it's not that great; it's only when I'm *not* high that I think being high would be such a wonderful thing. Well, in that moment of ""clarity"" I decided it really was a good thing that I'd thrown that shit out. 

All was going well until earlier tonight when I caught myself looking in the back seat of my car—had I perhaps accidentally failed to throw one of the joints all the way out the window? And that's when I realized that, although I only smoked one bowl or joint a day usually, I really must have an addiction. I'm ashamed to say I even thought about going back to the side of the road where I'd thrown the joints out the window. 

It's 9:20 where I'm at, and my body really wants to smoke weed right now. Like I said, it's been a year probably since I wasn't high at this time of the evening. This post is really just me rambling. It's mostly just for me, but maybe someone else will find something of value in it. Who knows. I'd appreciate any words of encouragement, or if anyone has some tips for me. Thanks guys.

At first is was fun and I made a bunch of new friends, but as I continued to become a daily (and lonely) smoker, I ended up becoming very reclusive and pushing away all my friends. I would spend all day and night in my room, smoking weed to the point where I became very depressed. Nobody wanted to talk to me, and I really had no will to make myself presentable to the world and talk to anyone (even my own family). Everything I did, I needed to smoke beforehand to make it ""enjoyable"" (e.g. doing dishes, buying groceries, even smoking on Christmas when I was hanging out with family). 

Back in October I decided to quit cold turkey. I was depressed, crying every night, and I was through with it. I didn't want to feel that way anymore, so I flushed my stash, threw out my paraphernalia, and erased all drug contacts from my phone. It was pretty easy to quit - easier than I expected, actually. The fact that it wasn't available made it more definite in my mind to stop thinking about it completely, which I did.

Now, it's over 2 months later, and smoking weed is creeping into my thoughts again. I tried to shut out those thoughts, but I find myself looking for contacts and thinking about smoking a lot. And I don't even know why. My life now is much more improved:




* my boyfriend is happier with me
* my day is much fuller (I cook, I read, I'm more likely to get out of the house instead of staying home smoking and killing time)
* my skin looks nicer (and I don't look tired all the time)
* I smile more
* I think clearer and my vocabulary/speech has improved significantly
* I'm friendlier to strangers, my family, and people who live in my building (i.e. I'm more likely to start a conversation or look a stranger in the eye)
* I'm more productive (I always got a lot of ""highdeas"" before but would never really act on them - now I'm actually following through on a lot of them, and getting stuff done!)
* no more anxiety when my stash starts to dwindle (and no more sketchy dealings with dealers  - like getting into vans with a bunch of big dudes to make a transaction)
* lots of $$$ saved
* I smell better and take better care of myself (hygiene-wise)
* no more paranoia, or feeling like I'm being judged

So how is it that we can see the damages that trees does to us, and yet we're still seduced by them? When I smoked, I was depressed and miserable *all the time*, whereas in the past 68 days I don't think I've cried once, and I've been the happiest I've been in years. Why is it so easy to be entranced by the dark side?

I'm currently 62 days sober (a fact I'm proud of) and I no longer have any cravings for weed. Let me start from the beginning. I started out just like everyone else smoking occasionally and with friends then gradually more and more until it was a daily thing. I got in with some pretty big dealers and decided, ""Hey, why not sling it seems like fun."" And it was fun...until I got caught. To summarize, I was caught at school with 1/2 oz bagged out, pipes, a vape, lighters, etc. I was hit with a felony and a misdemeanor. This was the first wake up call for me. At that time my girlfriend had been nagging me to stop slinging and to cut back on smoking as it had become my whole life (which was sadly true) but I didn't listen. I wasn't aware that weed had become a problem for me. I had completely let it take over every aspect of my life. I'd go to school to get high, come home so I could get high, stay up late so I could get high, basically just do everything with the outcome of getting high in mind. So when I got caught and I was put into a JADE program (Juvenile Alcohol Drug Education) where I had to pass a drug test to graduate I was pissed. Finally I decided, I'll just take a T break to pass this and then go back to smoking. They had me go to 2 NA meetings as a homework assignment. I found I actually enjoyed the meetings. They curbed my cravings for a few days every time I went. So I started (of my own accord) going to them weekly. I stayed clean and a few weeks in to my sobriety things got a bit easier. I had devised a routine for myself: School, gym, homework, sleep, repeat. The gym tired me out and gave me the same effect weed had in that I was able to sleep soundly. It also helped me maintain my appetite. The homework was allowing me to pull up my slipping grades and that was actually very satisfying knowing I could do well in school again. The thing that helped me to quit the most was actually my girlfriend. Last summer we had gotten caught by her dad smoking in her room. Needless to say, he hated my guts for it. Since I was sober now I thought he might give me a second chance. How right I was! She informed him I was going to classes and NA meetings to help me stay clean for her and he said he was proud of me for it. We're now having a stable relationship and he has put the past behind me. My life is amazing now without weed. I have good grades in school, I have a great relationship with my girlfriend, and in general I don't seem to run into any problems now that I'm not associated with weed. You guys/girls that are just starting out, stick too it and see what new things life has to offer.

Can't wait.,eastlakebikerider,24,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/13v9w5/4_weeks_sober_i_shudder_to_think_what_the_next_4/,"I used to tell myself as I lit up in the morning before my six figure job that I was in control and I could stop whenever I wanted.  Then, only after I was high, I would feel guilty and promise myself I'd quit - after the next bowl, after this bag, after this month, after this year. 
I now realize that I was never in control and in denial about my relationships with both weed AND booze.  I used to think that an alcoholic was someone who was drunk all the time.  I now realize an alcoholic is someone who loses control when they drink, or someone who drinks to lose control, and I am just plain fortunate that I never got into more trouble than I did before realizing that there ahem... *might*... be a problem.  I used to think that the 12 steps was bullshit Christian propaganda.  I now realize that even atheists can be spiritual, and this 12 step thing has worked for a lot of people and deserves another look - with a fresh perspective.  I used to think smoking or drinking would offer escape from my problems or emotions.  I now realize that no matter how far you run, or where or HOW you hide, your problems will have to be eventually faced and sorted out at some point in time.   I used to think that smoking and drinking only impacted MY life, I now realize how selfish that thought and act really was.  I used to think that smoking raised my consciousness.  I now realize how much I missed living in the present. I've missed a lot I now realize, and it's hard not to feel regret. More guilt, more shame.  I smoked to forget.  I forgot what it was like to have dreams.  I forgot what it was like to have nightmares.  I forgot what it was like to be awake and present.  I'm still trying to wake up.  I hope I will.  I know I will.  

All that said, I also realize that I'm still in the 'early' recovery phase and my path to recovery is a long LONG **LONG** path to travel.  

I still struggle with a LOT of things - words like 'addict', 'alcoholic', 'surrender' (that's a big one), the aforementioned guilt and shame, and poisonous ideas that my mis-wired brain keeps suggesting - things like: how much can you talk about or listen to others talk about NOT doing something?  How can you have a good time/party without booze or weed?  I'm such a funnier/more like-able/more creative/outgoing/better person when I'm drunk or high.  Why is the thought of lifelong sobriety so scary? 

I used to think I was the only person who had these and other thoughts.  After reading many of the posts in this sub (and attending many meetings) I now realize how I'm not alone.  At all.  You're not either.

I have been smoking pot since I was a teenager. In the past two years I stopped smoking a lot of pot because I would cough until it was uncomfortable to continue smoking. I always wanted to quit smoking and felt like it was holding me back in many ways. The longest I quit without being forced (I was on probation as a teen. Can you guess why?) was three weeks! I was quite proud of it!

After one night of boozing @ a local bar a friend drove me home. We stopped at his house first. He was smoking Mr. Nice Guy herbal incense. I rationalized that it was not reefer and would be OK to take a single hit. I was already drunk, but I can recall how quickly the single hit of spice made me feel. I had my girlfriend at the time pick me up a pouch two days later. Thus begins my ~two year addiction to smoking research chemicals/spice/incense. 

Long gone were the days of scoring a bag of weed from a buddy. This was much easier. I simply drove to the store and legally purchased my smoke. Spice didn't make me cough and in my opinion is very powerful compared to MJ. Being addicted to this stuff is worse than pot if you ask me. Incense blends would zombie me to the point where I would fall asleep through out the day. I would wake from my stupor to puff a few hits and continue my stay in dreamland. 

The past few months I would purposely not buy a large amount of spice because ""this is my last sack"". I would try to smoke it up as fast as possible so that I could start my journey without dope. This usually resulted in me waking up as early as 6am and driving to the gas station to score a bag. Did I mention this stuff is easier to acquire than reefer? 

At one point I went as far as ordering ""pure"" JWH-018 powder off the web via a western union transaction! I bought five grams of white powder with the intention of making my own incense blends. My friend and I that purchased the powder ended up smoking it all before we made any herbal blends. Yes, we smoked five grams of powder. WTF!!?? I wonder how much damage I have caused my human body at times. 

I am 27 and have a son that is almost nine years old. I feel like I have been a poor parent a majority of the time. I am involved in his life and see him quite often, but I don't feel like I was really there 100% if that makes sense. I feel that my selfish habit is interfering with the raising of my boy. 

This morning I attempted to smoke the last little bit of ashes left over from a 10g ""WTF"" pouch. After I was done I threw away my glass pipe and cleaned all the ashes and empty spice containers from my room. I have not smoked anything since this morning. 

I was under the impression that spice like synthetic MJ products were banned state wide in FL as of July 1st, but a friend of mine called and said they already had new legal versions on the shelves! Hrmph...I wish he would have never told me. Now my scumbag brain will attempt to rationalize buying a bag in the future. 

I am sick and tired of feeling helpless to addiction. I have told a lot of my friends how I feel about smoking and my addiction. My mother is aware also. She usually attacks my addiction which immediately makes me defensive about my use. 

I plan on not buying or smoking any herbal blends tomorrow. Day one is over. I look forward to updating a successful no spice day two tomorrow!

I also have been having flashbacks again, going into strange childhood memories or thinking about unimportant things. Just allowing my thoughts to wander for the mere enjoyment of having them wander and not commiting to the concepts of mental self-discipline I have built during my sobriety.


I also feel less engaged with people, with work, with doing other things. I care a bit less. I feel like I'm wanting cheap pleasure through food and video games and porn, and am less motivated to seek more hard-gained fulfilment.

Im going on a vacation and needing to be sober for these 2 weeks is a good start, before i left i discarded of any and everything tree related. Thanks for being here leaves i know ill get your support.

EDIT(Day10): So for my first update, I'm going to be completely honest, I kinda feel like i've let a few of you down, I relapsed once, on an island that was a stop on the cruise I was just on. I got drunk, searched for a bag of weed, which was really easy the second guy i asked with a rasta hat hooked me up easily. I justified this by saying to myself ""fuck it your on vacation let loose"" that and the fact that my cousin and I never really did get to smoke up together much. Not exactly good excuses but none the less I smoked up and felt shitty about it. As for how im feeling being sober the other 9 days, its great. The first few days I was a bit sensitive to everything, but being really honest with my family they gave me some support and acknowledged the fact that I was having slight withdrawal. I feel great right now, my head is clear, I've got some goals set for when I get back home and I don't intend to smoke again. Cravings are coming and going, but I can feel they are getting less and less. Thanks for reading and the great support so far. Leaves are beautiful ^_^

tl;dr I relapsed once, got irritable the first few days, but feel great now.

EDIT(Day 14): Dreams are extremely frequent and very vivid! I did not expect that to happen! I finally can lay down and sleep without trouble, took about 2 weeks of sobriety to achieve that. Also my natural appetite has finally came back and I'm eating 3 healthy squares a day, with less ""munchies"" towards the end of the night, actually I dont think I've cracked a bag of chips since I quit, yay less sodium. Cravings are getting few and far between. The ""haze"" thats been clouding my mind is slowly dwindling, I can already think more clearly and more quickly. Needless to say I'm excited to regain my short-term memory and such.

tl;dr Dreams, un-aided appetite and I can sleep way easier now.

EDIT(Day 21): This update will be short as I dont really have much to say, I no longer have mood swings, my appetite is 100% back. I'm eating healthy again, I'm not lazy anymore and I have little to no cravings to want to smoke herbs anymore. Infact I've inspired two friends of mine to take what they are calling ""tollerance breaks"". Hopefully they'll see the light too that lifes not just about smoking herbs. I don't tend to go back to toking ever, and too anyone reading this, if you've ever thought about quitting, just do it. Give it a whirl, you will be irritable, you will have trouble sleeping and you won't have much of an appetite(This is my exp). But in the long run(2 weeks for most ""withdrawal symptoms to wear off, for me anyway) it feels effing great to not be burnt out all the time, thinking about things way different, and I plan on enrolling into university. Thanks trees for the good times, but bigger thanks to leaves, for helpin me dive into being sober :].

At first, it was hard getting out of the fog of unusual vivid dreams. The brain fog lasted for a bit, but was quickly cured by a trip to Starbucks to meet with a family friend who's helping with personal support. 

What really made me happy was going to the gym afterwards. I've fallen really out of shape and really want to lose weight so my clothes fit again. Now, without weed to keep me lazy and perpetually hungry, I have a chance at achieving my goal. Still, it's not going to be easy. I was sweating profusely, got my heart rate insanely high (180. The elliptical told me to slow down. I didn't. Fuck you, robot) and am definitely sore and uncomfortable. Then again, that's probably how it should be. If personal fitness were easy, it wouldn't be as valued.

I think that the same thing is true for weed: I'm uncomfortable to be doing without it, but maybe that's a good thing. The fact that there is discomfort shows that this is a serious decision that will be ultimately beneficial in the long run. I don't want to be dependent on something that makes me comfortable with things that I shouldn't be comfortable with. That's been a moral issue for me. 

IMO, the best and worst part of weed is that it makes you comfortable with where you are in life. This is great when you have a successful, stable life, but lack satisfaction in your personal life. The problem is that most of us as users, especially young users, SHOULDN'T be comfortable with everything. Being unemployed or living with your parents past a certain age should be uncomfortable, because that discomfort makes us strive for more. 

I've decided it's time to stop being complacent with underachievement. I've got a full-time job in my ideal career path and an apartment lined up within a matter of weeks, but both are dependent on living clean.

This is the longest period of time I've gone without smoking since 2008 (the year I started smoking daily).

I had a dream last week that I decided to give in and smoke once more. I convinced myself by saying I'd have no tolerance and it would be like the first time I smoked. Well, in my dream I made that decision and it sucked. I felt shitty and paranoid and couldn't wait to get back to Day 1. Even in my dreams I don't really want to be smoking weed anymore.

I've had my share of temptation. Not as much lately, but in the early days I used to smoke Primetime cigars occasionally when I felt like I needed to smoke at the end of the night. I liked that moment of going outside and taking a drag, but I knew it would be bad to replace one addiction with another. I still take that moment outside, but I'll take a cup of tea or coffee instead. 

Overall, my life is improved. My quality of sleep is great and I feel more prepared to start my day when I wake up in the morning. I can remember words more easily. I've cut back on my late night snacks. I read more books. I find I'm more open to social situations than I ever have been. 

Folks who are just starting to attempt to quit, don't give up! Things get easier after two weeks. Once you get to three weeks you'll feel like you have more control over your life and if you're like me, you'll never want to go back.

As I said in my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1g21us/day_30/), I got a job at starbucks recently. I absolutely love it! When I was smoking a lot, being a morning person sounded like one of the most horrible things I could imagine. I'd smoke, stay up playing video games or watching tv and eating, go to bed at 3am, wake up at noon, rinse and repeat. However, ever since I quit smoking and started going to the gym, waking up at 5 in the morning for work isn't such a bad thing. Since I'm not spending money on weed nearly every day anymore, I'm finally able to save without changing nearly any other aspect of my life. 

It may be because I've been eating healthier and exercising, but my laziness has seemingly disappeared since I quit smoking. My mind is clearer. I'm regaining my sense of smell (don't blow smoke out your nose, mkay). Life is just all around more beautiful when you're sober. What more could you ask for than to just enjoy life with a sense of clarity as your body is intended to enjoy it?

I got a fortune cookie when I went to Pei Wei the other day that said something that's made this whole process a whole lot easier. I know it's a little cliche, but it's helped nonetheless. It said, ""Success is a journey, not a destination."" It made me realize that no matter how I end up, as long as I'm making improvements on myself little by little consistently, I'm perfectly successful. That's all I really want out of life. And I must say that quitting smoking has definitely lead me in that direction.

I've been smoking everyday for 7 years (at least 5 joints a day, but often more, and sometimes laced with tobacco). I made myself a promise to quit while I was still 30...so it was time.  

I came up with a plan to ease my anxiety about quitting (cold turkey isn't my thing).  
**Beginning June 1st** I bought cheap weed (the dry stuff with barely any THC), and allowed myself to smoke 3 times/day   
**June 7th - June 14th** I kept with the cheap stuff and cut down to once a day  
**June 20 - 22nd** I had one very small bowl per day with a pipe (I loved the joint part, so this was a big deal for me)
**June 23** ...I quit!   

I think this works best for people who really want to quit but have a lot of anxiety about withdrawal...it took a lot of willpower to stay with my plan! The only possible symptoms I've noticed is a bit of insomnia - but I have insomnia as it is, so it could just be me.

Before I got pregnant I was an everyday, every free minute, why would I not want to be high type of smoker. It was a huge part of my identity, my friends new I was the biggest pothead out of all of them, I did stand up comedy and the stoned chic was kind of my angle. I was prpud of myself, I could smoke anyone under the table, and no one had as good a stash as me. 

I got pregnant and quit smoking for a while, but was so sick I started looking fpr articles telling me it would be ok to smoke while pregnant. After i found enough ""evodence"" I smoked, not near as often, to help cope with nausea and the fear of what was to come with my new life. I stopped smoking 3 months before my kid was born. She came put perfect, so so so perfect. For about 4 months I didnt smoke, I was so sleepy from staying up with her I didnt even want to. I thought it was out of my head and my life.

I struggled though, I was such a busy person before my kid, full time student, full time job, great friends, happy relationship, and did stand up fairly often. Going from being really social to being a stay at home mom was crazy hard. Working did not logically make sense for the family, my fiance and I beleive me not working and staying with her is absolutely in her best interest, maybe not mine, but hers, thats what counts. Life at home with her was lonely, and I suffered from a bit of depression, and struggled with thw guilt of not financially helping to support my family, a feeling that my fiance has tried very hard to rid me of, he tells me how important my job is, but I still cant bring myself to see myself as anything but a lazy moocher. 

To get more to the point on 4/20 my fiance and I had my parents babysit our girl and spent the day with our best friend and got high. It was awesome and while we were syoned my fiance agreed to buy a bag. This started our lives as smokers again. I would smoke with him after our girl went to bed every night. Some days I would smoke during the day and go for a long walk with our daughter, she would nap and I would walk her around for about an hour.  I would tell myself what I was doing was ok, but the fear of getting caught was always in my head. I only let a few friends know, and for the most part only smoked at night when she was asleep. 

A couple days ago my fiance told me he wanted to quit, to get rid of everything, and we would close that chapter of our lives. He told me I didnt have to quit if I didnt want to, but I couldnt do that to him, it would make it so hard for him, not to mention I think would lead to a bit of resentment. 

So here I am, i feel depressed, nauseated, drowsy, and I miss it so much. I think its hard not just because I loved smoking so so much, but also because i felt like it was my only connection to the life I had before I became a mom. It was nice to have time to clear my head, have an hour or two to do something for myself that made me feel human.

I've been browsing through this subreddit for almost 5 days now and the first thing I want to say is just: ""Thank you!""
All the people here are so supportive and it really helps me a lot from staying abstinent. So I decided to share my story with you:

I'm 21 and I've been smoking pot every day for almost a year now.
My last weekend turned out to be the most sad and fucked up weekend in my life, so I decided to stop smoking.
I have a girlfriend and we are in a relationship for nearly 6 years now and I can't put it in words how much I love this girl. Though I never had an other girl in my life I can tell that she is ""the one"" for me.
So back to my last weekend, I spent friday all alone in my room, drinkin beer and smoking pot. Saturday too. My girlfriend was out with friends of mine and because I'm a fucking jealous person the wildest thoughts ran through my head.
On Sunday my girlfriend finally decided to be honest with me and she told me how much I changed by smoking weed. We were both crying and I was so upset (not with her, but with myself) that I was like: ""Fuck everything. I have to get out of here. I will flee to a foreign country where noone knows me and live a shitty life."" (Luckily those thoughts disappeared on Monday)
We we're arguing about our future, our lives and our feelings.
As you can read above, I was a daily toker for one year and because of that, I spent most of my time with a friend of mine doing nothing else than getting high.
I neglected other friends, especially my girlfriend, but I never really cared about it (cause getting high was of course the best thing to do to flee from reality and my feelings).
She told me that her feelings for me have lessened (that's the point where I start crying, while writing this) and that we need a pause to find back together.
Smoking weed every day was annoying me before, but as you probably all know it's hard to get out of this habit (as it was nothing else than a fucking habit for me). I just needed a serious reason to stop and that's where I'm now.
For me it's just not worth smoking a plant and loosing the girl I love for this.
So the last 5 days I didn't smoke any weed (though several times I had the opportunities) and it isn't hard for me at all, because my future depends on it. And do I want to spend my future being alone, smoking all day long, or live a wonderful life together with the girl I love? Unquestionable!
I've talked to many friends (even to those I neglected) and I can't say how thankful I am for every single one of them as they were totally honest and understanding with me. (Which I never thought, when I was high)

I don't know what to write anymore as I'm still an emotional wreck and just want to share my thoughts with some people who maybe experienced the same.

Reading through this subreddit the last days I also realized that I'm not the only one struggling with his life at the moment and I can just repeat myself by saying thanks to every single one of you. Together we will stay strong and win this fight! You are such an inspiration for me ... it's truly awesome!

So I've been following this awesome community for a while now, and 42 days ago decided I would quit. I went from smoking 5-6 bowls a day, everyday for years, and could barely remember being sober or dreaming.

It was messing up everything, my workouts used to be consistent and strong, my sleep early, and healthy, and my motivation to do work excellent.

Quitting made everything better. Except for the cravings. They got worse and worse every single day, because weed was my reward system - good workout? Smoke. Good job on work? Smoke Good job on exams? Smoke. Etc.

Suddenly it wasn't there anymore and after 42 days, I just had to try it, and I took one puff, and regretted it instantly. When I was sober I was desperate to be high, but the second I got high I was desperate to be sober again, and being high sucked. But now that I'm sober again all my mind can think of is being high again.

Have any of you troubled with this? 

Any good ways to keep the motivation going on past a few days? I've been trying to find a good way to reward myself for being sober, a day, a week, a month but can't seem to find a consistent idea?

If any of you have any ideas that would be awesome!

I haven't smoked pot in 3 weeks guys.  Aside from two slip ups to cure some terrible insomnia on nights when I worked early the next morning.

This is my 7th or 8th attempt at quitting and all of the other times I had made it 2 days max. I just want you guys to know that it gets significantly easier as time goes on, and honestly, I feel fucking great.

I've struggled with depression for the last two years, and now I've got myself on an awesome diet, I'm exercising, I'm spending time on my hobbies, I'm sober, and I'm the most leveled out and happy I have been in years and it's great. This was the best decision I have ever made. It get's better guys, it honestly does. I'm on the other side now, and you all can be too. 

You have the willpower to do this, and it may suck for the first little bit, but address it head-on. You are ultimately in control. Just remember, when you slip-up, don't get upset with yourself. You need to remain equally as forgiving of yourself, as you are dedicated to quitting. Maintain a positive attitude about it, and trust me, before you know it, everytime you get high you will start to realize you wish you were sober. It doesn't take long for sobriety to become appealing once your leveled out and able to think without your head in the clouds.

I run my own business mainly working from home making it real easy for me to smoke weed whenever i wanted to. 
I make pretty good money working from home so getting weed and getting high whenever i wanted to was never a problem (really bad combo if you want to quit) recently reflecting on my business I thought over the last 5 years weed never really affected my work but it really did, potheads can easily convince themselves otherwise to continue the habit. a few big projects failed and that was due to me not being proactive, not taking the extra time and learning more about the project/scope,  I would rather get high now and forgot my problems and worry about it the next day, but then the next day you get high and keep pushing those problems back ...its a bad cycle. 
 So I tried to only smoke after work hrs, but really that doesn't help . So now im trying to just quit, Im fed up and angry that this shit has a hold of me like it does. I would drive really fast after meetings just so i can get home and get high asap, I've been in a few accidents already because of this urgency to get high.  I was hit with a pretty bad cold last week and thought this would be a good time to stop.smoking.  when your really sick with a cough/headache/ dry throat it makes it a bit easier i think to start to stop as the urge to smoke is not as strong.  Its now been a week and Im no longer sick and now feeling the need to light up again, but I'm also feeling good and almost getting that crisp feeling back again /feeling and thinking sharper/ - i want to continue this and I want to be done with this habit. I don't like to talk about myself or my problems so writing this was hard, but after reading allot of positive posts here i feel its giving me the strength to quit and maybe sharing my story will help someone. Most of my peers have families, houses and a good life, I want that now and I'm hungry for it,  so that's going to be my drive to quit, I rather be successful than high

*Preface: I'm on day 4 of not smoking. I did quit last week as well, but only made it to the weekend before smoking again. Definitely a setback, but if anything, I have even more desire to quit this week because I can see how little smoking did for me this past weekend. Through all of these quitting attempts, I'm really learning a lot about myself, and why I started smoking so much in the first place.*

As most people here know, heavy pot smokers lose the ability to dream at night, myself included. Well, especially this week, my dreaming has come back full-force. And those dreams have not been particularly pleasant. The reason they have not been pleasant is because the last 2 nights I've woken up from dreams about my ex-girlfriend. I won't go into detail about our relationship, but it's important to know that we had an on-again/off-again relationship for several years, and it was very emotionally damaging to me when she left me for another guy, and I still had strong feelings for her.

Last night, I woke up from my dream sweating, filled with anger and regret about the way I acted with her, thinking of what I could have done differently, and if things would have turned out differently if I did. It also made me upset that some of the good times I had with her were replayed in my dream, bringing back old feelings of affection that I had for her. Honestly at that that moment, I would have smoked weed if I had it, not because I wanted to be high, but because I wanted those terrible thoughts to just GO AWAY.

From the fact that I'm still dreaming about her (which I don't like one bit), and my strong emotional reaction to these dreams, I'm learning that I never really got over our relationship. Instead, I just numbed myself with weed and buried the emotions deep down without dealing with them.

While it might be painful for all of these old memories be resurfacing now, I know it's important that they do so that I can properly deal with them. Writing this post right now is already helping me deal with them. It would be easy to just start blazing and ""forget"" about her again, but I know that the problem wouldn't be solved, but only covered up.

**My Advice:**

Which brings me to the point of my post; a word of advice to others about what quitting weed will do for you, and what it won't.

We've all read the inspirational stories on /r/leaves about how people quit smoking and how much it has improved their lives, and I don't deny that quitting can seriously improve people's lives. But in reading these stories, it's easy to just see the outcome of a better life without seeing the journey that someone took to get there. 

What I'm getting at is that quitting weed **won't** automatically solve all of your problems. In fact, as you're quitting, they might actually seem worse. But quitting **will** enable YOU to solve all of your problems, with a bit of effort. Quitting will lift the hazy cloud of smoke in your brain and allow you to clearly see and attack all of your life's problems. 

Many of my own past quitting attempts have failed because after I quit, I looked around at my life and said: ""Well, this still sucks!"" - and back to smoking I went. So please, be aware that despite the new outlook and fresh energy you will get from quitting, you still need to be prepared to tackle the rest of your problems as well, or you'll likely end up right back in your old smoking habits.

It just got me thinking, why am I still doing it?

I'm past the point where it gave me life altering mental ideas and notions of myself.

I smoke weed when I'm bored... which is whenever I'm not working...

I have an amazing girlfriend who doesn't do any drugs, but she doesn't necessarily see the weed being an issue.

I just... feel dull.

I feel like the sharpness I used to have has faded.

I used to be so much angrier... but it was kind of good.

It made me more present, more honest and more myself.

I feel like the trees changed that but it's also hard to stop. 

Sigh.

I don't even know what I'm looking for here on leaves.


I feel so ashamed of myself because of this crutch. this fucking crutch that has dictated my emotional state since I was seventeen.

Grandma died?
fuck it, smoke a bowl, not saving her!

Lost job? 
Better buy some weed to celebrate

Not enough money for probation?
Oh yeah, I bought a half!

It sucks. My biggest heroes are guys who don't really use drugs either
Sam Roberts, Henry Rollins, CM Punk (WWE is a great stage show, fuck you), Ian Mackaye, Jim Norton, Louie and others.

I was a little blogger bitching about the older kids I knew smoking weed in my little home town and three years later I'd be there with them.

It's all about wanting to right?

I think I want to, but I constantly say to myself ""Yeah but you can always quit after this bag"" and I think that has at least something to do with the (in)ability to acquire marijuana. I keep thinking, yeah but so and so probably won't deal forever, why not keep getting it while you can.

I don't know.
I'm just making excuses.
I don't know what I want for myself, what I should do, anything.

Quick backstory... I posted here 24 days ago explaining my situation. TL;DR is I lost a 6 year relationship, and weed probably played a part in that (I was complacent).

I managed to go about 10 days before a relapse... I dropped her things off finally, and finally accepted this was really happening. Not ready to process it, I ended up smoking a Q over the next week (my usual routine).

Following that, I once again went 10 days sober... doing even better this time I'd say, I deleted my dealers number and worked how much $$ I'd wasted on weed (~$1200 in 3 months, :-( ).

Last night I ran into an old friend at a bar. He invited me to his place to smoke. I was already pretty drunk, and I had also told myself I was OK with smoking socially still (I don't do it socially often, so I figured it was OK to allow that).

Well, I now regret it. A lot. At the time, it was good... but today I just feel like shit (hangover doesn't help, but it's more than that). I was doing really well with the breakup, hadn't cried in some time and was accepting that it was for the best for both of us.

Now my emotions are just scattered and fucked, I miss her so much and just want to smoke to numb the pain. Or fight to get her back. Even though it's way too fucking late.

Not sure what the point of my post is. Just need to vent. Stay strong people... it was literally half a dozen bowls. So glad I deleted my dealers number, because there's no way I'm letting this relapse go on.

Thoreau was one kickass dude and is one of my favourite writers of all time. I love this quote, especially in light of what we are all gathered here to do - to take back our lives and becomes masters of our own destinies using the power of our minds, hearts and will. If you work hard at making your life better, you can and will succeed! Keep going and stay strong! You do have to power :D 

Full quote ""We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids but by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep.I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by conscious endeavor. It is something to be to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a few objects beautiful, but it is more glorious to carve and paint the very atmosphere and medium through which we look, which we morally can do. To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.""

Even my reddit account name holds some faith to that lifestyle. About 2 years ago i moved back home from school after my first year of school, the change left me lost and really depressed. I comforted myself with marijuana and food, and was seemly drifting through life with no real direction. Luckily one of my friends also moved back home so my time wasn't entirely consumed with self loathing and self destruction. This isn't to say that we didnt smoke, we did, alot. However we would smoke and hang out, talk about life and we actually started designing t-shirts as a creative outlet. Soon the tshirt idea didnt pan out and it became a redundant routine of smoking and chilling without any true fulfilling accomplishments. I gained close to 25 pounds in this downward spiral of depression and self destruction, and subsequently became even more depressed. My sisters, who i love more than anything in the world, began to look at my not as an older brother, but as a disappointment. I don't know if you ever had someone that you love, TRULY be disappointed in you as a person, but for me this was my lowest point.

I started taking biology at my community college i enrolled in after my return home, and it may have been the greatest decision of my life. I never found something that I actually wanted to learn until i took this course. After taking this course and receiving a 92, I felt good, ACTUALLY good. Not high, not baked, but happy. I felt that if i could accomplish this, I could accomplish anything. I started working out alot more and smoking less. My grades had always been good, but they improved significantly.

But anyway, its been almost a year since my sisters gave me the wake up call, and i enrolled in that class. I made the decision to quit entirely on my 21st birthday and thinks are lookin up. Now I'm 21 years old, 35 pounds lighter and on my way to a University in the fall. From my experience I can say that quitting and finding the right path comes not from hitting rock bottom, but love. The love i have for my family meant too much to me to let them down any longer.

I hope this helps those of you trying to quit, you don't need it and it really makes a difference.

Over the years my wife had always ""not approved"" of my smoking yet every now and then she would smoke too and of course enjoy it.

Well finally at the start of this year I just had an enough is enough moment smoked my last bud and haven't looked back since. No withdrawal no more ""just once"" done. And boy do I feel good. 

The moment I realized that I had kicked the habit was after an interesting family visit we had..

very long story cut short...my brother in law was staying with us, did a runner from the cops and hid his weed here, it sat in my drawer for at least a month and I didn't think about touching it. Finally disposed of it (in the rubbish bin) after the cops didn't want it.

Once I knocked weed on the head next came COD and just in the last 3 weeks I have finally stopped cigarettes (a big reason I failed that so much was I still smoked weed).

Sure I see the ""benefits"" to weed and for a long time my favourite defensive line was ""What if cannabis cured cancer?"" until my dad said...""who cares, you don't have cancer.""

I've just hit a month without smoking.  My current mind state compared to when I first quit is night and day.  For probably the first two weeks I was completely miserable.  Everything reminded me of smoking.  All I wanted to do was give in and smoke.  I felt like I needed to smoke every time I was challenged with something that was even mildly difficult.  Anxiety and depression set in.  Every excuse possible went through my head about why it would be ok for me to just smoke 'a bit'.  In the past when I quit I would always cave in but this time I tried to pay attention to my thoughts and use them as reason of why I needed to stop.  They were all thoughts of an addict and I can't get by casually smoking.  It always turns into full out dependency.  

Time heals.  I started trying to keep myself busy.  I've been meditating for two weeks now and I really think that this has helped.  I started keeping track of not smoking in chains.cc and then I added a meditation chain.  What I really think it comes down to is building my discipline.  Sticking it out.  Being proud of keeping the chain going.  It might seem trivial but it felt great being able to get through the day and add another day of being clean to the chain.

I also can't say enough about how important /r/leaves was to me when I first quit.  I didn't think I needed a support group because ""it's just weed"" but that was my ego talking.  Being able to read about other people going through the same struggles as me and then being able to have an outlet to vent and hopefully help others was so helpful for me.

If you are thinking about quitting, please read through my posts and others here.  You shouldn't feel ashamed about wanting to quit or struggling to quit.  Nothing you are thinking or going through is new.  We all have weaknesses but we also have the ability to acknowledge them and then work to get past these hurdles.

I quit smoking weed a day over 2 weeks ago because I was becoming increasingly antisocial; I would smoke, play video games, and go to school without doing much of anything else.  I have also recently lost my seasonal job (no income = no bud).

Since quitting my life has been a living hell.  Last Thursday someone slashed one of my girlfriend's tires, we replaced it on Saturday, and besides the $200 we had to pull from our limited savings, everything was fine.  Then, on Monday morning, someone slashed one of my tires.  I didn't have the time to immediately swap it out for my spare due to a test I had not prepared for (too busy replacing a tire and working my 1-day-every-2-weeks job).  

On Tuesday I received a job interview offer, and took it up.  I cancelled my plan of swapping out my tire, got dressed up nice and fancy, and went to the interview.  It was fucking cutco.  Motherfucking Vector Marketing is a subunit of Cutco Knives, which, if you don't know, is a pyramid scheme.  The interview and application process was a waste of 2 hours, and my car still sat on a flat.

I took the test on Wednesday and did reasonably well on it; everything was looking better.

I was supposed to be paid on Wednesday from some work I did two Sundays ago.  The money never came.  I called my employer (a major merchandising company) and they said they'd look into it.

On Thursday I went to class like normal, got home, and swapped out the flat tire on my car.  Everything was going fine up until the final tightening of the lugnuts.  I was finishing the final nut, giving everything I had into the torquing of the tire iron, when the bolt coming from the axle sheared off.  Now my car has no spare and one of the rear tires runs on 4/5 lugnuts.

Yesterday I got a call back from my employer.  They said that someone on the corporate level had messed up inputting my worker ID number and thereby payroll had skipped me.  I can expect my money *next Thursday*. 8 whole days after I am supposed to be paid.  It should be mentioned that I have been working for this company for 4 months without any hitches in pay, but now there's a problem and I have to wait more than a week to get the money they owe me.  If this was my food money, I'd be starving, if it was rent, I'd be in debt.

Now it's Saturday and I just finished my 10th application since Monday.  Today was for Subway, McDonalds, and Muvico- I will undoubtedly continue applying and calling throughout the day, even though I have 2 tests on Monday.

Somewhere in there I managed to rub open a dime-sized wound on the back tendon of my right foot.  I don't have any first aid kits nor money to buy one, so I'm improvising with tape and paper towel until it heals.

I'm not really sure what I was thinking. It was purely addiction that lead me on. After the experience, I am against the illegal use of marijuana. Regulations should be in place to prevent harmful process making. I never knew what I was getting and it drove me completely mad.

I guess I just need to vent a little, sorry if this is a little long and jumbled.

I've been smoking with my boyfriend every evening for about 4-5 years now. Poverty, anxiety, stress, boredom - they all played their part, and we chose the easy route.

I used to be one of those people who begged the people I loved to not smoke and become dead inside when I was younger (everyone in my life smoked it as I was growing up). Now look at me, I am a full out junkie pothead who seems to be slipping in psychosis. 

It started with one joint a night, to help me sleep. Slowly progressed to to about 7 joints a night, and now smoking in the day too. What initially was started for anxiety and sleep, has now turned against me and I feel like I have hit rock bottom. In the beginning I used it to shut my chaotic brain down, but it now gives me all the ability to think about everything that is wrong with me, and not change any of it. I lie all the time to the people I love and do not recognize myself anymore. 

I started antidepressants properly about 2 months ago. It had finally gotten to the stage of staying on them, dying, or worse, becoming my father (alcoholic type of sociopath who phones up his kids drunk by accident and comes out with little gems like 'which one is this?').

I have finally decided a date to quit, just after my boyfriends birthday. I have not told him yet, and I'm concerned that he will freak. If he loves me, surely he should understand. 

He is also falling apart, and has also started on antidepressants. It has gotten to the point where we are both constantly worried about the other doing something stupid. 

Its not just the weed, its poverty, lack of hope and the fact that we are both so tired of fighting (its been a **hell** of a few years). 

I have known I have to quit for years now, and I accept that I have made huge mistakes. I see this point in my life as a sort of sliding doors scenario, I continue on this path, I lose everything. I'm a stronger person then that, and I know the anxiety attacks are going to be severe, but i know i need to go through it.

Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you to this community for being here. I guess I am writing this so I can hold myself accountable in the coming shit storm. I think it will help me to stay on track a lot in the coming weeks.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_znpps,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/znpps/i_need_to_quit_now_or_dissapear/,

There were a few occasions where pot was being smoked right in front of me and I thought my will would break, but I declined and felt great about it. 

I was given a ticket to appear in court on June 18th and went to my arraignment today. Since this was my first drug offense as an adult I was given the option of taking a drug diversion. After I successfully complete it the charges are dropped!

Two days after I stopped smoking I decided to stop masturbating and viewing pornography. I have also stopped smoking tobacco three days ago as well. I stopped using tobacco for almost a full year, but relapsed the night I was ticketed for the weed. 

I noticed I was drinking alcohol too often after I quit smoking. I have started a Joe's Goals tracker for alcohol. Terms of my drug diversion program are no alcohol and I will be randomly breathalyzed. I imagine I could get around this, but I plan on making this negative a positive and will go completely sober while I am completing the program. 

This is the first time in many years where three days have passed and absolutely no smoke entered my body! It feels good. I have started exercising again also. I re-joined the power lifting team at a bad ass gym in my area and will be training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu / mixed martial arts as well. I believe physical fitness is the missing piece of the puzzle in my healing process. 

I have been spending more quality time with my son. I have been reading more books. I have been playing guitar. I have been playing less video games (hardly any). I go on walks to collect my thoughts and plan my day first thing in the morning (Tony Robbins, hour of power). I feel good about myself and my life. I look forward to this new chapter of my adult life. I wish I would have started it much sooner.

1342336636.0,22,self.leaves,wl39y,I can't seem to kick weed despite trying numerous times. ,Blackfish007,22,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/wl39y/i_cant_seem_to_kick_weed_despite_trying_numerous/,"Hi Leaves, I've been a lurker on the subreddit for a while, but I've really gotten to a point where I just need to post something like this, at least to just get it off my chest. 

I haven't been able to quit smoking weed on a daily basis, despite numerous attempts and the intellectual understanding that quitting would drastically improve many aspects of my life. I'm 24 years old, a year out of college, out of work and looking for a new job. 

Although I started smoking with friends in social situations (I didn't even buy for myself alone until probably my sophomore year of college), I eventually went on to use it to self-medicate, becoming a daily wake-and-bake smoker. My grades suffered, even though I could skate by with B's and C's with minimal effort (my college experience was punctuated with countless frantic all-nighters). 

Before I say anything else, I feel like I need to explain a little about my family and how it relates to my feelings about this whole issue. I grew up mainly around my Dad and his side of the family (which features my grandma, my four aunts, and my one uncle). To just come out and say it, they're all depressed, kind of sad individuals (I love every one of them, but these are just my honest thoughts about them). My dad is even the best one out of them, but even he is generally joyless, not excitable, and anxious. He's a doctor, and he's incredibly smart. Ever since I was a kid, though, I just felt like he was always on this grind that he wished he could get off. He was always exhausted. He worked all the time, and he seemed miserable all the time. He was rarely home, and when he was he would generally just go into his room to read (I really understand that a lot more now that I've grown up, because I love reading now, but as a kid this baffled me). He's not very good at small talk and communicating and has never seemed to really have any close friends. As a young kid and through high school, I noticed all these things more and more, and it especially had an impact on me when I first started smoking. 

You see, I see a lot of my family in myself. Although I'm not morbid, I've definitely always been a nervous, awkward, low-level depressed guy. So when I first started smoking weed my junior year of high school, it was one of the greatest times of my life. I finally broke into a genuinely nice, funny group of friends who shared a lot of common interests. In weed, I found this lovely, refreshing new vision of what life could be, what life could feel like, and it didn't involve this thick, lacquered layer of familial guilt and shame that I had felt like I had been plodding along under my entire life. There was such a liberating innocence to it, and I loved it. 

The problem is, I know I need to quit and move on, but I've tried over, and over, and over again, and it just always fails. I'm going to keep trying, but it's honestly getting a little scary. I've probably been telling myself I want to quit for about two years now. Whenever I quit for a day, or two or three, or however far I get on that attempts, emotionally I just can't stand it. I get bored, I get anxious, I get depressed, I feel hopeless, whatever it is, and I just feel the need to smoke again. 

I guess I don't really have any specific questions. This was more of a cathartic experience, but if anyone has any thoughts or similar experiences, I'd love to hear your story or how you overcame the negative emotions of trying to quit. Thanks to anyone who read this thing. ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_wl39y,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/wl39y/i_cant_seem_to_kick_weed_despite_trying_numerous/,
1340321117.0,20,self.leaves,veoqb,Feeding Shadows,beachtimeafterthis,25,5,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/veoqb/feeding_shadows/,"Hi Leaves. I'm Kate.

I had planned to write this on Day 1. It's really day 3 right now, and I put it off because each day that goes by lets me think a little clearer about who I am and how I ended up here. My original first day clean post was going to be......angrier than how this one will be. Not only because of whatever withdrawals I had then and am still continuing to get, but because I was really angry with myself.  This post is more for me, to get the days and weeks of thinking I've done down on paper and cemented before life comes along and I forget the details. But I've read almost every post a couple of pages deep when I was stoned out of my mind, and seeing people going through what i was struggling with helped more than they will ever know. And maybe this will help someone else in turn. So here goes. I'm Katelyn, I'm 22, and I'm addicted to Marijuana.

Addiction is really a loaded word though. I've seen Pills destroy people, just kill the light in their eyes until you know it's not really them looking back, it's whatever they are swallowing or snorting hiding behind their eyes. So I don't think that's a right description. Weed doesn't hop on your back and hook it's claws in you like the harder drugs do. It's your friend, it wraps it arm around your shoulder and tells you what you want to hear while it leads you down a side road of life. Until one day you look up and have no idea how you got to where you are. It doesn't take your life, it takes you out of life. And I let it lead me down that side road and even thanked it for the directions.

It really did boil down to me though, about how I work inside my mind I guess. When I was growing up I had the nickname 'Sunshine', something that I still relish having people call me. I was always talking to people, always out picking random strangers and striking up a conversation where I was. It wasn't an attention seeking thing I think, I just really like meeting new and interesting people. I carry that idea over into my non-people related life too. When I went to a restaurant I'd order the weirdest thing on the menu, just to try it. A lot of people say they are music freaks, but I lived and breathed it. French R &amp; B? Got some. German rock? Love it. English singer songwriters? Yeap! I tried as many new things as I possibly could, everything was worth at least one shot right? I wanted to experience EVERYTHING I could from life. From the crazy chefs in hibachi restaurants doing tricks while they cook my sushi to seeing every sunset. And I was happy.

So when I tried weed at 18 it was love at first sight. To someone thriving on experiences it was heaven sent, it made music better. Sex was amazing stoned. Food......oh god even meh food became awesome. From reading here a lot of people started off slow, but I jumped in with both feet and went straight to everyday decently heavy use. I got a job that paid way too much for someone that charmed their way in under the door and the degree requirement. I came in, I did my job. I always dressed well, even as the years went on and I fell deeper into it. I ran everyday. I was the ultimate closet stoner I guess, to the point that a ton of people didn't have a clue that I even smoked much less went straight home and smoked until I forgot I was supposed to be smoking. It was easy to justify, I had a job, friends, and an apt. It was just to relax right?

When I was 20ish my dad knocked on the door to my apt and sat me down for a talk. Not about me, but him. Part of his program required him to make amends for the damage he caused, he said, he had started up with Alcoholics Anonymous. It was a shock, more than a shock, since neither me nor my Mom had any idea that he even drank. I'll come back to this later, it's important.

But it didn't stay just to relax, or make experiences different and interesting. I tried to think about where it changed to a routine, but I honestly have no clue. Eventually I smoked...because I smoke. That's what I did, like it was a profession or a government mandate. I got off work, I did whatever errands I HAD to get done before rushing home and smoking. Smoking alone, naturally. Having a smoking buddy didn't last long after I first started, since my mind usually went too quick and in different directions that someone talking to me was annoying. As time went on I started to see my family and friends less and less to get in just a little more smoking time, pushing people away until they eventually did stay away. I had my own little bubble, just me and the baggies on my table. Alone. Going from 'Sunshine' to alone took shorter than I would have wanted it to looking back. Eventually the compliments on my clothes or hair turned into about how I looked tired, or if I was feeling okay. Sleep sucked anyway, my brain just felt like it *worked* when I was stoned, I had better things to do like stare at the ceiling and think.

A couple things worked together to open my eyes, but the biggest was something my friend said. He asked if I wanted to hang out, since it really had been a long time. I made up an excuse, something about going home and going straight to bed. But he looked at me and was like ""You are cool as fuck Kate. But I'm worried about you. I never see you anymore and I know you're not going to go to bed. What are you hiding that you can't let anyone near?""

It was like a knife in my chest. I've heard it before, somewhere else. My dad, talking about the stupid lengths he want to hide his drinking. Just....insane lengths. And for all of that, I was on that same path without even knowing it. All behind a mask of 'it's just something I do' I had changed my entire life to center around going home and getting high.  A friend of a friend had come up to me a couple weeks earlier than that. He said his (both of our friend) was crazy about me. My first though was 'No way, I can't let him in'. I just smiled said 'okay'. TBH I don't even remember what non stoned sex is like.  I traded my soul and everything I believed in for a chance to be bored, home alone. 

I found this place from the side of GetMotivated and started reading. I even set a goal to stop smoking, when I ran my last baggie out. But something happened I guess. I was smoking even harder than I did normally, just trying to run the bag down, when I saw what I had become. I wasn't Sunshine anymore. I was boring. From enjoying life to avoiding it. I don't know why I did it, I was high as a kite and not really thinking at all, but I grabbed my bong and baggie and ran into the kitchen.  I threw whatever weed I had leftover into the sink before throwing my bong in after it. Crying like a baby I grabbed a skillet and smashed it.

So my Day 1 came a lot quicker than I expected it to. I have a box of Melatonin that I bought to prepare for what I read was coming. And it still sucks, even with that I've been waking up like 4-5 times a night. But something changed this morning, my day 3. Before I would be foggy and moody for like a couple hours after I went to work, until 11am ish. Today at around 8 in the morning I walked by a coworker with a stereo playing, and started to sing 'Living on a Prayer' for like 15 coworkers. At the end of it people were laughing and smiling when someone came up to me. She said 'You are really chipper this morning. You usually don't really wake up until later. I like this you better, whatever you did keep it up'.

Has my opinion on things like legalization changed? I don't think so, at least right now.  Carl Sagan and Michael Phelps are tossed around a lot on the stoner community. But for every one of them how many dumb people just kind of fade away? Some people can handle it I guess, other people have little dark spots in the corner of their minds waiting for that something to feed off of and grow bigger. I had one of those. I chose to feed it. But I'm not feeding it anymore.

Some people let life happen. Some people make it happen. I lost something when I was living out of a bong. An appreciation for life maybe. And I want it back. Some I'm going to proofread this a little then I'm going to the beach and watch the sunset sober for once. Love starts with yourself Leaves, find what makes you happy then ignore everything else. I hope I help someone as much as this subreddit helped me. You aren't in this alone.

I think it helped me through that period, but I continued smoking basically every night once university started again. I found myself utterly unable to get motivated for anything related to my studies. I was just not handing in assignments, attending none of my lectures and missing labs that were worth 10-15% of my grade. The courses I was doing were not particularly hard and were actually really interesting once I found myself forced to study them.

At the end of semester I had about two weeks to study for three exams and did absolutely nothing until 10pm the night before each one. Two of them I pulled all nighters for. The night/morning before my last one I actually ended up smoking and trying to study high, something I had never done before (I don't know if it helped or not TBH). It's not like I spent those two weeks in the gym, reading, socialising or even playing video games, I would just sit at home thinking about how I needed to study, whilst aimlessly browsing the internet. I felt shit and knew exactly what I had to do to feel better but just could not do it.

I managed to pass all my courses (two of them barely) and continued to smoke through the holidays. I tried to quit once or twice but never lasted long. Once the semester started however I decided it was time to stop and threw out the rest of my weed and all my smoking stuff.

It was actually incredibly easy and I definitely felt an improvement in my motivation and energy level for my studies. I was far from perfect though and did start to miss lectures and actually missed one 10% assignment.

I gradually improved however and up until a couple of weeks ago I was really getting on top of the work and enjoying it too!

Then one night, my dealer msged me (I had deleted his number) saying he had picked up some weed. I thought, ""I've been working really hard, I'll just do it tonight as a once off and then maybe on weekends"". It took me a while to convince myself that it was a good idea, but I think I knew deep down once I got the message that I was going to be smoking that night.

I think I have smoked all but one night since then, and I now feel exactly as I did last semester. I absolutely have no motivation to do any work whatsoever, I will procrastinate doing absolutely useless stuff (I don't know where my time goes) and am getting really far behind again.

The thing is, I do really enjoy smoking and I feel it could be a positive part of my life rather than just a nasty addiction. However I don't seem to be able to do anything productive during the day when I am smoking at night.

Does anyone have any similar experiences? Is it time to just give it up altogether? Or maybe try cutting down to weekends only?

1329858865.0,20,self.leaves,pzumd,Some words of support,yahallo,24,4,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pzumd/some_words_of_support/,"I used to ""pride"" myself in my drugs of choice that expanded my perception and brought on a means for spiritual awakenings, AKA psychedelics. For example, I didn't like alcohol as I felt it had no spiritual basis and was just something to get drunk with. It's not as if it's imperative to even use an exogenous substance to bring about states of higher consciousness. Still, I'm sure y'all can agree that THC, LSD, MDMA can be used as a tool for widening the mind, if used properly and not abused.

There's a quote by Tom Wolfe in ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"" that has stayed with me:

""They're just beginning to open the doors in their minds-"" ""But once you've been through that door, you can't just keep going through it over and over again-""

What I saw in this quote was, after a while, there's only so much you can learn from, or ""get out of"", using these tools. The revelations, epiphanies, and insights you get, or going though the door, would be a redundant process. Once you've milked everything out of it, and seen everything it has to offer, you won't be learning anything new.

My continued usage was, in my mind, having the same effect as alcohol would: just a sensational effect devoid of any true meaning. Eventually, I felt as if it was just slowing me down, a source of my brain's chemical imbalance and bringing on anxiety and depression. I knew it was a problem when other aspects of my life were really adversely affected, my academics and relationships with other people, and I knew I couldn’t keep making excuses why I could/should continue using.

Think of your body as an infrastructure, a building, a house, for your mind. There are things you would rather not bring from the outside into your house that would dirty it. In the same way, there are things from the outside that you wouldn’t want put into your body.

We all have an ideal vision of ourselves in our mind, be it of what we see ourselves accomplishing for the day, or for a future goal. We know exactly what needs to be done in order to make that vision a reality, we know exactly the steps needed to be taken to reach that goal. All that's left is for us to carry it out. There will be times of ""one step forward, two steps back"", and cravings may seem like a self perpetuating cycle, but as with anything worthwhile, our persistence and drive will keep us on top to maintain a net result of stepping forward.  What's stopping you from attaining that exact vision, that exact goal? Don't let yourself keep you from your most ideal. 

**TL;DR:** I’d say if you have an understanding of why it is you don’t want to continue with things you know aren’t in your best interest, you’ll be successful away from it. You’ll know what you’re not missing. You’ll instead be taking on better things that’ll help you grow. Spend every day improving yourself on how you were yesterday.

So I, like it seems a lot of you have, picked up smoking the wonderful herb in college. It was my freshman year and I was just coming off a bad breakup. Weed helped me when I thought I needed it most. Fast forward 5 years and here I am. Still smoking the same herb.

Now I must say, I was always one to say smoking has never hindered me in the long or short term. I graduated college with honors and work a great job in my major. I'm very lucky to be where I am. However I am feeling a serious shift in my life. Smoking isn't for me now what it used to be. It used to be fun. Extremely eye opening and I felt allowed me to do a lot of self discovery. I used to feel like weed helped me sort though problems in my life. It was an escape at the end of the week. I had finished all of my school work, taken care of all my responsibilities and could toke up guilt free. I enjoyed it immensly and at that moment knew I would always be able to turn to weed. We all know its safer than most drugs and doesn't create an addiction or a dependency problem, right? Wrong. Not for everyone. And I, like many of you, are one of those people. 

I went from smoking on the weekends in college to gradually increasing my use. Its gotten to the point now where I would smoke on my way to work, during my lunch break, and immediatily afterwords on the way home. Its been a long time in denial but I know now it's time to grow up. Discovering this subreddit made me understand that other people feel exactly like me. I always thought I was alone in thinking weed was becoming a problem. I had a hard time coming to the realization that I cannot control myself anymore. I can't be the person that can buy a slice and make it last weeks on end only using when the time was ""right"" That will never be me and I need to grow up and face facts I have a problem.

So here I am again. High at night. A time I used to look forward to. A time that used to be our escape. The one place we could all retreat to in order to work through our problems. Now it haunts me. I don't want to be high anymore. I don't want to live life in a constant fog and haze of worrying about when my next toke will come. 

So here I am. I'm nearing the end of my bag now. (Oh and by the way, now for me, a bag is a half ounce. I need an entire half of an ounce of weed just so I know I have enough to get me through.)  And just like I have been feeling for the last year or so, this is it. This is my last bag. No more after this. This time I WILL turn my life around. Yeah right. You've said that before, whats different this time? I don't really have a good answer for that. Is this the last bag I will ever need to pick up. Can I finally kick this cyclical nightmare that has become my life. Maybe its not so bad. I have my job, a home to call my own, and am able to maintain a terrible addiction. I just feel like I can achieve more. Before I began the herb, I remember a different person. Someone I could always count on. Now I'm question who I am. What I'm capable of. Thats not me. Its what I've turned into. I've lost many friends, girlfriends, and I feel like I'm isolating my awesome loving family. Im so private I don't ever want anyone to find out this affliction i suffer with. I feel like people would just tell me to man up. People don't understand. Not like you guys.

So thats the reason for this long this long ranting venting session (And to all of those still with me, I thank you so much for hearing me out) I want your help, leaves. When this bag is empty and I realize I need to grow up, I need to know people have overcome this. And that its been worth it. I want to know it will get better and I can leave this vicious cycle. When this high fades and this bag is gone I want be free from the herb.

Any support, success stories, helpful advice, cruel truths, are so welcomed. The reading will give me motivation and keep me busy. I discovered this subreddit and it was a big reason I wanted to start my sober journey. So much positivity and support. You guys are my only support group. I feel like I need to finish this journey on my own. No help from family or friends. I will beat this. I encourage anyone and everyone to rise above this now. Take a stand and we will overcome our sadness and regret. 

Thank you all so much for reading. I will update with progress if people are so inclined. I welcome you all to share your stories here too. I want to help this community and be rock for anyone else going through this. Together we cannot fail.

**TL;DR - I've smoked for 6 years. This viscous cycle needs to end. I need to be free and get my life back. I feel like this subreddit is the only place my feelings will be understood. I ask for your support and stories.

Here's my story",throwaway87374,22,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1i1f62/day_0_first_try_quitting_with_rleaves_heres_my/,"So I'm sure my story is similar to many others here. I'm 22 years old and ready to quit for the foreseeable future. I started when I was 16 as a weekend smoker and loved it. This gradually lead to everyday use after school which lead to wake and baking before school. By the time I was 18 I was a daily smoker and thought nothing of it. 

I turned 19 and moved out with one of my friends deciding not to go to college after graduating high school. ""Ill go back in a year"" I told myself and I have been telling myself that for the last 5 years. Me and my friend started selling weed and things really just took off from there. We were selling a lot and had more weed than we know what to do with. So I got accustomed to smoking 3 to 7 blunts a day. 

All good things come to and end and we got robbed. Long story short I ended up having to move back in with my parents when I was almost 21. I cut down a bit but still was smoking about 3 blunts a day to myself. But hey, I had the money for it and everything was fine in my book. 

Since I turned 22 (6 months ago) I have been having more and more doubts about weed and my usage. I always told myself ""I can stop anytime I want to"". But so many times I found myself not doing something so I would have money for another bag. Im always thinking about how much I have left, and when I need to get more. Prioritizing weed over other more important things. Which leads me to feeling guilty about how much money I spend on weed and how frequently I need to re-up. I have more bills now and just never seem to have much extra cash b/c anywhere from 300-450 a month is going to weed. 

I also have just been feeling like an idiot since I don't have much to show for my life since I left high school. I see everyone I graduated with now graduation college and getting good paying jobs. I have been working the same landscaping job for 5 years scraping by with nowhere up to go in the company. I feel like I NEED to go back to school. I think weed will get in the way of that on top of needing that extra cash for school. (any tips for getting back into/enrolling in college would also be greatly appreciated.)

And lastly I fee like I haven't been as physically fit as  I was 5 years ago. I went to the beach the other day and couldn't hold my breath for long at all. I have had a bad cough for the last few weeks and I haven't had a sober mind in years. I always told myself I could do it no problem if I wanted.  But even yesterday I wanted to quit but convinced myself ""one more 20 sack"" since I had already smoked that day. I want to actually accomplish that goal of quitting and feel good about myself again. To be honest with myself I haven't been really happy in a few years and have been using weed as a crutch. I want to feel like a productive person with an actual social life.

There are other reasons why I'm quitting but I feel like I'm already rambling. Any tips will be greatly appreciated, I know I can do this but it's really great to a place like r/trees to talk about it and see others are going through the same thing. 

Once again, thanks for listening guys.

Then i get a huge amount of anxiety. So much so i end up picking up before 10pm. It's the fear that i may change my mind at a time later that night when it's too late to pick up. It's stupid and i have an addiction. 

I have no real pieces, only plastic because i cant bring myself to buy anything glass or permanent. Because I've been trying to quit for 2 years.. I use to have an mflb. Today i threw out everything anyways. 

My depression is definitely a factor as well. In high school i saw a therapist regularly and took zolaf*. I haven't done either in about 3 years. Today i plan to call my doctor and get back on antidepressants. I stopped taking them my freshman year of college and that's also when i started smoking. 

I knew and have been told to stay away from drugs/ alcohol because my family has a history of abuse on both sides. So genetics are against me. In college i bought into the whole weed isn't addictive thing and ran with it. Huge mistake. A long distance break up sent me to the smoking every day and being high all the time phase. I haven't been able to stop since. 

I'm in my 4th year of a 5 year chemical engineering program and an about to flunk out.. My decline in grades directly reflects my smoking habits. I suck for throwing away such an awesome opportunity and i dont have time to feel bad for myself. I need to end this addiction and i need help.. From anyone.. 

If anyone has read this and is willing to message me / encourage me, it'd be greatly appreciated.. Id give out my number. I've lurked here for a while and will be following a lot of the tips of read. 

I plan to eat better, exercise again, go for more walks, find a hobby that isn't in front of a monitor, delete all dealer contacts, throw all away shitty pieces, make a visual reminder for days past, and probably start drinking heavily... 

The first 3 days are the hardest. After that im golden until i trick myself into thinking I'm doing great and i can afford to buy a gram. Lol addict. But I've never made it longer than 2-3 weeks. 

But to get past the first 3 days i abuse alcohol and sleeping pills. Not at the same time. The first day my anxiety is to high so i drink until i can comfortably pass out. The other Two days a pill or 2 at night will help me to fall asleep. As a disclaimer, i dont consider myself drinker. I don't drink alone and have always been careful to watch how friendly i become with alcohol. 

I'm writing this asking for help and as reminder that I'd like be somebody and not a zombie. 

My biggest dilemma is whether or not to tell my parents. I don't think i can do this by myself and i crave there help so much. I wish i had the courage to tell my mom. But i dont want to break her heart and I'm unsure how/ if she'd accept me after wasting away at college.. My biggest regret is not telling her when i couldnt quit 2 years ago, and i wonder if not getting her note will be a regret another year or so from today :(

Every night I looked forward to getting high so I could listen to music, masturbate, play video games, and laugh.  I honestly enjoy about 10% of the duration of the effects of cannabis.  The other 90% gives me extreme depression and anxiety (which I already have somewhat bad without being high.)  Marijuana makes me scared, sad, and the opposite of relaxed... Yet I did it.  I did it every night.  Not to sound... crude but a big part of the reason I smoked was because I felt it increased my sexuality.  It made everything ""feel better"" during masturbation.  I know it sounds silly but today is the first day I haven't smoked and the biggest temptation to smoke up it to enhance my masturbation.

I feel that I can overcome this but some of the things I enjoyed before smoking seem to be... lessened now.  Its like every time I do something that I enjoy that I say to my self ""Yeah, this is okay I guess.. But imagine how much better this would feel if you smoked two joints and then did this?""

",JesusExists777,24,6,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/17uqde/after_being_sober_for_4_months_i_smoked_a_dime/,"Last Tuesday, after craving weed for over 3 weeks, I decided on having a little fun during a school break. I purchased a small sack of what I thought was golden-green happiness. I couldn't have been so wrong. 

I'm going to explain what happened as simply as possible, because I know while THC is in my system, I can elaborate on things too much and trail off into a topic that doesn't matter. Like I'm doing now. 

Anyway, I honestly thought it wouldn't be much of a big deal. I shouldn't have been so foolish, because after being addicted to the dumb plant for over 3 years, at such a young age I might add, the only thing that could come out of this experiment would be devastation. And I knew this. I wanted to prove ""myself"" wrong though- I lusted for the opportunity to say ""See? That wasn't too difficult. Weed is just like alcohol and caffeine now, I'll smoke once every so often and not be an addict.""

Well I was right in that regard, except for the fact that it wasn't enjoyable at all. 

For one, my memory has suddenly become a tiny specimen of its former self. Every time I wake up- since that fiasco five days ago- it's like I'm seeing everything new again. My room isn't recognizable. Sure I remember where everything is, but it's like, visiting a dream I had when I was young. It's weird. Everything is new. You might say, oh isn't that kind of fun? Well, no, it's scary. Imagine walking into your home and thinking ""I haven't been here in a long time"" when you just left for a cig. It's just, you know something's wrong.

Also, my skin hurts. You know how sometimes the entire half of your body becomes numb whilst high? The feeling has barely gone away, and it's the opposite of content. I wish I could explain it.. like a flaming sort of burning sensation. Like my skin has sensory cells but they're being destroyed as I speak. Maybe it has something to do with my nerves. It's gotten better since Wednesday, but it's like I'm wearing a layer of melted plastic. My pain tolerance has gone up way too high, too- I can withstand sticking my hand in a toaster oven. Man, I suck at english too lol.

You know when you take a huge hit, hold it for 5 seconds, then release it, just to feel that rush of THC running up your spine? Yeah, well, that was also painful. It felt like cold acid burning through my head, or someone stabbing me repeatedly in that certain motion. 

After two joints. This all happened after less than one gram of weed. 

Not to mention I didn't even enjoy the high. I'm actually happier sober than while under the influence. I can tell now why doctors call it a depressant. that's exactly what it was. After three hits I realized I shouldn't have continued smoking. Before all the pain and torment, I wished the experience to be over already. 

All in all, this taught me a valuable lesson. Life is better without drugs. (I guess some of you could say DUH at this point, but I've always thought they could embellish the good and what not) It took almost half a year to recover from them.. but with exercise, (some) healthy relationships, and a steady diet, (not to mention I'm straight with God) I'm actually more euphoric than when I'm inhaling cannabis! It's amazing, I never thought that was even possible!

I can now look forward to the future without constantly thinking about something I don't even like anymore, blocking my view. The craving is gone! It's brilliant! 

Hey, I guess I'm trying to turn this lemon of a situation into lemonade. Even if I am still in pain. 

So, yeah. I just thought I'd share. It's really not worth it. *If you've been sober for a day or two- it get's so much better. Much, much, much better.*

I know these effects will wear off slowly, so it's why I'm not freaking out. 

tl;dr : Smoked less than a gram, didn't feel good, wanted to be sober after the third hit, and four days later I'm in pain for some reason. Life is better without drugs as a means of entertainment.

My own high standards and inability to live according to them is a constant thorn in my side. When I discovered trees almost 3 years ago I knew all of this, and I knew that I had a so called ""addictive personality"". I'd consistently overindulge, grow tired of something, then stop doing it altogether.

The stop doing it part never came however. It's been a while since I sincerely stopped enjoying being high and it became nothing more than a habit. Realizing and admitting all of this hasn't helped me at all, I still smoke, much to my own frustration and annoyance. 

I do stop now and then, but by now every time I light up I feel no better than your average junkie. I gave in again. I feel weak, and in defeat I wish to forget my problems, so I smoke some more. Same viscous circle.

Quitting all together seems like admitting defeat as well. I know myself, I know how I am keen to become addicted. I want to rise above this by developing and maintaining a ""casual"" relationship with trees. I'd see that as the ultimate victory. Being unable to do this in the past however has left me with little hope in actually doing this.

Edit: Thanks for all the responses everybody! I feel that I needed to hear a lot of the things said, although I was unable to do so on my own.

One I've noticed over the last few days is that I will answer the phone now.

I used to dread receiving calls to my phone. ""Did I wake you up?"" people would ask when they heard my voice. ""Were you sleeping? Are you ok?"" I'd feign having been woken up from a nap, even at stupid times, like 8pm. Often I wouldn't answer it at all, even when I knew the call would have to be returned, and I wouldn't probably be any more sober then than when I was getting the call in the first place. I was a woman over 30 hiding from her own sweet parents.

But now the phone rings, and I answer it. We have a chat, info is exchanged, and next steps happen faster than when I'd dismiss the call, not listen to the voicemail, and often forget to call back altogether, making simple things take days instead of moments.

I decided to take a break: for the last three weeks, I've been completely clean. Melatonin remedied the sleep loss, but the depression I developed lingers, to some extent. Most encouraging, though, was the improvement I saw in my mental clarity, in my articulation, my thirst for knowledge, and my desire to work hard and succeed. It was the feeling comparable to a fog that sat in my mind disappating, and being awake for the first time in a long time.

At the same time, my desire to smoke has never left, for all the advantages I have seen to living clean. Is there any specific activity that anyone else has found to distract them from that want? Does it ever go away? How have others filled the time?

http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/sner8/on_the_verge_of_losing_my_job_here_are_the/

So I did indeed get fired from that job. 5 other people also got fired that day, so I called it getting laid off, but in reality I was fired for my performance.

This turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to me.

So after I was fired, I had some time to think about a few things. I pledged to stop smoking weed. I used all the time off to go to the gym and get a tan. I lost 25 pounds over the summer, enjoyed myself, picked up some girls, and smoked no weed.

After two months 'laid off' I ended up landing a dream job at a super cool ad agency in a large city. Moved away (to a city where I knew a lot of people from a nearby college) and started anew. I've continued to work out and not smoke. It's been truly great.

Now that I've been in my current job for 4 months I feel safe in saying that I am a fundamentally different person. Not really in terms of my personality, but in how I conduct myself. I have confidence in my work and continue to amaze myself when I remember something that needs done, and then get it done. I'm super well liked here and my new clients really like me.

About my smoking habits now-
I actually moved in with a guy who sells weed. Funny enough, he actually quit smoking because he saw how well I'm doing. I would casually mention the positive effects it's having on me (it's nearly impossible not for me to talk about this with my close friends because it's been such a drastic change) to him and my other friends and many have also quit.

I do smoke on occasion, I would say about once every two months. The next day I usually wake up and my throat hurts and my brain feels foggy, and I'm like 'that was fucking stupid' but then go on with my day. Never have weed cravings.

Not sure how this will be taken, but for me I would consider quitting weed to be relatively easy. I didn't advertise that I was not smoking weed to friends. I kept it my own little secret until I was a few weeks in and my friends noticed. Even then I felt stupid trying to tell them why I was quitting, so I didn't. They didn't need to know.

If I could summarize the change it's had on me into one word, it would be 'easy.' It's made everything so much easier. A couple examples-
Memory- 'Oh you want to hang out on Tuesday? Actually I'm supposed to x, so let's do it on Thursday.' Potentially frustrating future situation averted.
Small talk- 'God I'm so quick and witty, I genuinely think I could spark a conversation with anyone.' I've said this to myself before and believed it.
Free time- As I said above I use my time at the gym now, but you could use it to do whatever with. I no longer have that shitty feeling of missing out on smoking weed.
Longer term thinking- That fuzziness would cloud my thinking so much I could never achieve long term goals because it was too hard to figure out the steps in between. This applies to large projects at work too. No way would I have been able to move to a large city with fog brain.
Mo' Money- Speaks for itself.

I can remember the very first time I saw the Leaves subreddit and realized what it was. My stomach hurt, I was knocked back that a group of people would treat smoking weed with this kind of seriousness. 'Do I have a problem?' I asked myself. And I definitely did.

I guess a quick footnote- I've found out that past job was toxic. I didn't realize it at the time because it was my first job, but the company has some real issues. I have friends still there that are being treated the same as I was and they don't smoke weed. Not sure I could have ever been successful there, but damn glad that it all happened the way it did.

Just wanted to thank everyone in the community. You guys were and have been great in helping me figure things out, and what I read continues to make me think.

But there's hope, r/leaves family. After a decade of smoking, it's only taken til day 3 to already feel a little better. And dammit, I feel PROUD of myself.

If you guys haven't checked out this youtube channel by HockeyAdvice, I highly recommend it. He's spot on with everything he says, even if he's a rambler! He said one thing in his part 5 video (or was it video 6?) that really hit home for me: Humans only need water, food, air, and sleep to survive. Habits add onto those 4 things. Alcoholics need alcohol, water, food, air and sleep. We've adjusted our bodies to need trees, water, food, air, and sleep. And our bodies will continue to crave trees until we stick it out and show it that it doesn't actually need it. Anyways, writing it out doesn't come off as inspiring as when HockeyAdvice said it, but the point is that there is no secret to quitting. It really is just a matter of time, as long as you give your body that opportunity to experience time without trees. The hard part is giving your body that opportunity, but after that, your body will readjust on its own.

I want out of the rat race. It's time for me to be employed, clear headed and an adult. Even though I am one by many years, I feel as though I have regressed with the weed in many ways. Most noticeable is my short term memory. I work in the medical field so I need to be clean from here on out. For prescreening employment and randoms after that.

I made it through ONE stupid day. ONE. This afternoon the anxiety was out of control and I just gave in and smoked. I knew I shouldn't have, but I made up every excuse in the book. I feel so low and like such a failure. I used to be a positive, upbeat person. I want that back.

Then Monday came. The night prior, I slept for one hour. Night sweats and a super painful headache/neckache prevented any attempts at sleep until 5 in the morning. Then, I had ridiculous nightmares during my one hour of sleep before I had to get up for early law class.

Rage. I wanted to punch an infant. Everyone on the road was a ""fucking moron that needs to pull their head out of their fucking ass"" or a ""stupid fucking cuntplug."" The TV was too loud. My wife needed to stop asking me questions. Everyone shut the fuck up! No professor, your jokes are not funny, you stupid chode.

Oh, you want to go for a jog with me Mr. Classmate? Fuck you!

You get the idea. Today has been a little better. I slept okay last night and I'm feeling so much better than before. I'm posting today because it's actually hard to bring myself to even post on /leaves when I'm in such a dark place. I think you guys know that feel.

I've had anxiety for a long time. Back in '08 I had stopped smoking up as part of making several healthier lifestyle choices. Then something pretty devastating in my life happened, and I started again.

Since then I had been smoking multiple joints a day nearly every day for four years. The longest self imposed break I had was for about four weeks earlier this year. At that point I thought I could smoke ""just occasionally"" again, but it only took a few days for me to fall back into bad habits. After reading some really great posts on leaves this July, I realized that others had the same issues as me, and seemed to only get away from the psychological addiction after deciding to quit for good. So, August 1, I started counting days with the resolution of never picking up the habit again for the rest of my life. Admitting that I had an addiction, and that absolute abstention was the only way to end it, really helped.

It wasn't easy. I kept a journal for the first two weeks or so, which helped keep me in check. About three weeks in I truly felt free of the habit. I've had temptations since then but always reminded myself of the slippery slope I fell down before.

I'm on anti-anxiety meds, and now that I've stopped smoking up, they actually seem to be working. While I've had plenty of stress, I haven't had any general anxiety for prolonged periods of time. This is the longest I've been anxiety free since I can remember.

When I was smoking up, it was hard to be motivated at work. I would spend my day just counting the hours until I could get home and light up a joint. I have a great job, but weed was making me unmotivated to enjoy it. Work has been much more fulfilling in the last several weeks.

What I am happiest about is regaining my memory. Smoking so much, I could barely remember what I did on the preceding day. I found I could manage in social situations by faking my way through it, but now I'm really able to relate to others again based on recent experiences that I remember.

If you suffer from anxiety and are thinking about quitting, do it. Resolve to yourself that this is forever. Find a way to motivate yourself through the first couple of weeks - they are the roughest. Once you regain a sober lifestyle you'll find that it brings both positives and negatives, and you may need to work more on some of the negatives in your life, instead of dulling them with pot. Just remember that those negatives were already there - the pot was just your escape from them. Really addressing your issues head on will resolve them in the long term.

You can do it. One day at a time.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_10ck05,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/10ck05/54_days_later/,

At least once per day. I've been smoking for the last 4 years or so. Sometimes it gets in the way of what I want to do, sometimes I feel like my mental state becomes pretty fast and loose and it's not good for my relationship with my girlfriend. I have gone through periods where I don't smoke very much or very often but I keep coming back to it.

I just moved to a new city and it's been a difficult adjustment for me. Also some other factors put even more stress on me and my usage has escalated. Things seem to be calming down for me now but this last period of my life has made think that smoking pot is not a good way for me to cope with stress. However I have struggled with anxiety and depression (which are exacerbated by stress) for the last few years and I feel like pot has really helped me take a step back from all that stuff.

Now I want to take a step back from smoking pot but I feel like I don't know how to cope with stress (especially strong stress) in a progressive way. When I am stressed I find myself falling back into old habits of self-criticism combined with emotional sensitivity and clinging to extreme points of view. Pot helps me because I find myself so immersed in my experience that I can see thoughts and feelings as just another part of me, rather than constantly trying to figure out what they mean.

But the more often I smoke, the less I experience beneficial results from smoking. In fact, pot also can have the opposite effect of what I was describing above. Pot can encourage certain thoughts or feelings to reinforce themselves until the become completely overwhelming.

Pot also inhibits good communication as I mentioned in the first paragraph. If I am feeling upset and I can only communicate in stream-of-consciousness fashion, with various ideas popping up and fading away before they can be explored fully, that's not going to be a good conversation and that's not going to encourage growth in my relationship with my girlfriend. Also I am much worse at hearing my girlfriend out when I'm using pot, but instead getting emotional about some small part of what she is trying to tell me.

I got into meditation in the past and I feel like I could really benefit from continuing that work, but over time I started to expect certain results each time I would sit down for a session, which over time eroded away my intention / motivation. Meditation became more of an emotional commitment and a source of stress than a mental laboratory. So I mostly don't do that anymore, but I am still interested. I feel like I am in a rut in that sense and I don't know how to get out.

I know it's a rambling post so let me just say that I would appreciate any thoughts on stress and pot and anything else you want to bring up. ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_105jm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/105jm2/stress_and_coping_and_pot/,

I'm a 21 year old guy, who has pissed away his university experience, to sit at home and smoke by himself 75% of the time. The fact that I've just realized this depresses me. I'm going to start off by saying, that this is in no way a post against marijuana, I love it, and probably always will - but my personality is an addictive one, and I need to learn how to control that before I ever begin to occasionally enjoy a joint or so.

**A little back story:**
My first joint was my 13th Halloween on this Earth. I remember it like it was yesterday, I had myself a blast - even lost my virginity that night, but that's besides the point. At this point, I would smoke every 6 months to a year, nothing major. Fast forward 2 or 3 years, and it becomes a regular weekly thing. Fast forward one more year, and it becomes daily. My last 2 years, or year and a half of highschool was getting stoned daily after school with my friends. This didn't hinder my social life whatsoever, I had my close group of friends, my girlfriend-at-the-time, life was good. I had graduated highschool with good grades (35/45 in [IB](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Baccalaureate)), and was accepted into a prestigious Canadian univeristy.

I picked the university that I did because my family already had an apartment there, and my brother was living there attending a different school in the same city. So I graduated high school, moved to Canada, and decided to opt out of living in dorms and save some extra money. I didn't go to Frosh Week, cause I wasn't given a ""house"" cause I wasn't living on campus. I didn't meet anyone, and honestly, after a long day of classes, I was excited to commute the hour long trip it took to return home, toke a few, and play some video games.


The aformentioned girlfriend (high school) was a year younger than me, so after she graduated, I had finished my first year, and she moved to my same university. We started dating almost instantly, smoking and drinking freely - it was a dream come true for us, away from the constant gaze of our parents, or a *very* strict Islamic country (where we attended high school together), where EVERYTHING was under the radar (public affection, hash, drinks). Eventually, she moved into my house for a good 2 years or so, but after seeing each other every day for 2 years, at such a young age, we decided to call off the relationship. I've been sitting at home, alone, smoking pot, seeing the very few friends I have here and there.

At first I made it a point not to smoke before class, but that didn't last long. I thought, fuck it, I'm in University, this will last forever, 4 years is a long time. I blinked my eye, and now I'm in my 4th year. I literally haven't spent a minute with anyone from my school outside of class. After breaking up with my ex, I really only have about 2 or 3 good friends, that I can call and spend time with. I want to change me for me, but I also want to change, because I don't want to be the guy who plunges into depression after a break-up. I want to reinvent myself. 

I would smoke all day every day. 2 grams a day to MYSELF was very normal. 3.5 grams a day to my face (the way I've been smoking this past week) is usually the most I can do. Even if I come home at 9pm, I'll stay up till 6am smoking bowl after bowl after bowl, and before I know it, that's 1/8th gone, or 2 grams. I'm reiterating the fact that my social life is non existent. I prefer spending time alone, even though I'm a very sociable person. I know it's the pot.

I'm a decent looking guy, and I know that I'm intelligent (not to sound cocky). When I'm put in social situations, I thrive. But that ""when"" factor, is SEVERELY limited by how much I smoke, I never want to do anything. I prefer sitting at home, smoking pot, than going to a club/bar with friends.. Now it's too late, it's the fourth year of my university experience, and everyone has created their social circles and cliques. I go to classes, and everyone is talking to each other, and there I am, sitting alone, not talking to anyone, excited to get home and smoke weed.

I'm absolutely stupid for wasting so much of my time, and money, when I could have put my focus towards better things. To think of all the courses I've dropped simply because I was too lazy to go to classes, and got scared before a midterm.. Fucking pathetic.. People think of me as ""the guy who just sits at home all day"", and it's true. I need to grow up, I need to meet people, I need to get defeat this demon. If I can't control my urges, then I'm a weak person. I've been feeling this way cause I've been wanting to stop for about a year now, but I keep putting it off, and falling victim to my urges for a morning bowl.

Wish me luck, /r/leaves, I will need it. Sorry for the long read.


**TL;DR** I need to grow up.

**EDIT1:** I told myself that today (Monday 17th September) was going to be my first day sober in a long time, I have a lot of work to do for my classes, so hopefully that will keep me occupied today, as well as BF3 later on at night. I've been doing some bike riding, but I'd like to do a serious hourly ride per night, I think that would be really helpful.

**EDIT2:** I didn't smoke before class! I got home, and didn't hit a bowl! My roommate had a bong in his hand though as soon as I came home, that's usually the pusher for me. I just got changed, and I'm about to take a bike ride for an hour (hopefully two). Still sober! :O

Mary Jane has been awesome yet detrimental to me, personally. There are people out there that  smoke on a daily basis and get all their shit together and be successful, but it doesn't work that way for me. I got a doctors recommendation which is valid for a year and expires on October 2nd next month. I live at home with my parents and commute to college so I've got a lot of down time which has been filled with smoking weed. However, I've blown it out of proportion and have been smoking all day almost everyday. I want to stop but I don't want to stop at the same time but I know that if I want to be a successful individual I need to cut this shit out. I don't mind smoking on the weekends with my friends and being responsible about it, but I've taken it to a whole new level and been letting it get in the way of my school and everything else. 

My grades dropped over the last year, I'm not as outgoing as I should be, and I'm just not happy. All around me are successful people my age who have their shit together and are going places while I feel left behind. The sad thing is, I'm a smart individual and outgoing but that has been masked by Mary Jane. I love her, but I must quit if I want to be happy in the future.

I've come to the difficult decision not to renew my recommendation and try and smoke on the weekends with my friends or whenever I know I can relax and take time off. It's going to be tough but I know I have to do it. Typing this out makes me feel so much better. I have not talked to anyone about my problem and wouldn't even dare talking to my parents about it. 

I'm not looking to completely cut it out of my life, but I need to severely control it. I want to be a hard working and self motivated young man which I should be, but I'm just not at this point in my life. I've got all the ingredients to be a successful person which a lot of people around the world would die for. I've got a great family, money isn't a problem, good friends, I live in a good and safe community. It would make no sense for me to become a loser coming from my environment. 

Do you guys have any tips? I don't want to go cold turkey and quit altogether, but I need to severely control my intake. Maybe smoking only at night on the weekends when I know I've got nothing to do the next day so it won't effect my work. I want to smoke less and less until I'm not reliant on weed. I've been so unhappy with my life the last couple of weeks I just don't know what to do. My problems aren't 100% related to mary jane, but a big portion of it is. I feel I have motivational issues too (but that could be marijuana related). I want to stop smoking everyday, exercise more so I'm not so fucking lethargic all the time, and just be a better and more upbeat person.

How should I occupy my time when I stop smoking? Excercise? Reading? I think the biggest reason why i smoking is because I'm bored all the time and weed makes boring fun. When I went on a 5 week vacation, (3 of those weeks studying abroad) I stopped smoking and couldn't care less because my time was occupied with class, traveling, and hanging out with friends. But now all that is gone and I'm at home more often than not. 

And for those of you guys that read the entire thing, thanks, I really mean it. I've not talked to anyone about my problems and I've just kept it bottled up.

I started smoking when I was 15 and have been a chronic smoker ever since then.  When I was 22 I learned the art of 'home gardening' and for the past 10 years I've had more or less a constant supply.  During times where I'd use heavily, I would smoke upwards of 3-5 grams a day.  It has never drastically affected my work, my social habits or any activity.  If anything, I'm a very motivated and active stoner.  

Over the past year or so I've been attempting to start a family.  I've always had low T and it's never been a huge issue until now.  My little boys just aren't as powerful as they should be.  This is really whats driving me to stop.  

So, here we are.  Day 1, 16 hours in.  I've been putting this off for a good couple of months.  Every day I think about it, every day I say ""Tomorrow will be the day!""  Tomorrow comes and just as normal, the wake and bake occurs.  I've been through the withdrawal a few times.  I lose my appetite, get nauseous, suffer from anxiety and loss of sleep.  One of my biggest concerns is my significant other doesn't  know I smoke as frequent as I currently do.  She's seen me go through the withdrawals before on vacations, so she knows at least what can happen.

As far as the anxiety goes, I have a decent amount of lorazapam that I plan on using when it gets really bad.  The appetite and nausea, I'm just going to try and deal with it.  I'm definitely not looking forward to the withdrawal, this is really what's been keeping me from not stopping, more than not knowing what to do once I'm sober.

One of my biggest problems is I am a very addictive person.  I can get addicted to anything from hobbies, to drugs, to just normal things.  Building habits are way too easy for me.  Pot became a habit.  A habit that I abuse way to frequently.  If I could smoke once a week or even on weekends I'd be happy!  I am just not sure if I'll ever be just a recreational user.

The first two years were casual weed smoking, with friends, at home a few times a day.

As the stress of graduate school and other life stressors started piling up I started to smoke more and more weed.

I am a type A personality, I have to do everything to the extreme. I was drinking heavily then went to  pill popping for a bit then to weed as my main choice of drug.

I am smoking a pack to a pack and half of cigs a day, my parents and family have abadoned me (no financial support), my friends are all moved on to bigger and better things, and most significantly I was kicked out the graduate school I was attending and now am forced to leave the state to attend another school.

I used pot as a way to escape my problems but they only would get worse as I did less and less to remedy the problem at hand (my lack of studying/lack of ways to deal with stress)

In the weeks leading up to this post I have been smoking 2-5 grams of tree PER DAY!

Everytime I try to quit, I cant quit for more than 1-2 days and I succumb to the stress in my life I revert back to tree as my crutch.

I am tired of smoking (both cigs and weed but focusing on weed now) bc of its effect on my breathing and I am tired of constantly being high all the time.

I want to prove to myself and my family that I am not a drug user but a normal person that fell on some tough times.

I am so glad I found leaves and have started to read a book i found on Amazon called ""Secret Addiction"" or something like that.

If anyone has any words of advice or suggestions I am listening with all ears.

I smoked only one joint today at 3pm and I will wake up tomorrow and mark it as DAY ONE OF SOBRIETY!

I was tempted to get a fat sack tonight but chose not to. I am not going to let this drug control my life. It was fun, I thought I had a grip on it, but it took over my life and now it is up to me to get it back.

I'm afraid of losing part of who I am if I quit.  Losing a part of me that I love.  I love being a stoner and I love who I am when I'm high and if I could just leave it at that then this wouldn't be a problem.  It is a problem though.  I have things I want to do when I get home from work, but every night, without fail, I just end up getting high and getting nothing done.  I'll be out with friends that don't smoke and I find myself getting anxious at the thought of not smoking that night.  

Went through this exact fucking thing 10 years ago.  Couldn't stop on my own so I enrolled at a religious university as sort of a forced rehab.  I feel like I became so lame during those 4 years of sobriety though. I definitely missed out on the typical college experience and it makes me sad to think of all the fun things I missed out on.  I suppose I'm afraid of becoming boring again.

I guess part of the problem is that a very close relative of mine is a fairly well known artist.  Most of our bonding is over the drugs we do together and I'm so afraid of becoming boring and not fitting with that crowd anymore.  It's like drugs are the only thing that make me feel 'edgy' or cool.

Maybe I just need to accept that I'm not cool and artistic like that crowd.  I'm just an average person in a boring office job and a weed problem.

Tried getting hobbies over the years, but I suck at motivation.  Sometimes I don't even want to smoke per se, but I'm just so fucking bored and weed is the only thing that takes up the time.

I know what I need to do, I'm just scared.  Fucking terrified to be honest.

EDIT:  K, fuck it.  I've decided to go cold turkey. Starting today. And see if I can go three weeks without.  Been having panic attacks at the mere thought of it - which I'm taking as an indication that I need to do this.

I went back on the only meds that ever seemed to help me a little without turning me into a zombie.

Thank You For Listening.,InnerWill,22,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/n99wu/my_story_thank_you_for_listening/,"So, I have never put into words whats going on in my head, but it seems like a lot of you can relate to my story and I think it will just help to tell people about it.

First off. I am a guy in my mid 20's, and besides my vice (weed) I actually really have my shit together. I have a house, a great job that I constantly am trying to better myself at, I'm married to a beautiful women and have a great dog that I love. Honestly, I wake up feeling like I am living a dream on a daily basis, with the exception of 1 thing....I wake up every morning, regretting that I smoke weed, and telling myself ""Today, I'm done, I'm not going to smoke anymore. Its not me."" 

This happens literally every day, and every day when I get home from work I bust my dugout out and have a couple....Honestly, the way that I describe it is that it feels like a mini vacation every day. It transports me to a place that is unmatched. I feel extra compelled to do sweet things for my wife, make special dinners that I literally pour my soul into. Really, its hard to find the down side to smoking for me.

In fact, one of my favorite memories involves weed. I want to tell it to you because I think it has some significance:  

I recall waking up extra early on a gentle winter Sunday morning. The snow was falling lightly outside, and being dragged out of bed by the smell of the freshly brewed coffee that I had setup to auto brew the night before. Sitting down on the couch after plugging in my beautifully decorated Christmas tree that my wife and I had spent hours perfecting only 10-12 hours before. I sat there silently for a good 10-15 minutes petting my dog and drinking coffee.  After the fog was out of my eyes, I got up and went outside to shiver my way through a small bowl. When I came back inside the way I felt was indescribable. I felt like there was nothing wrong in the world, and all that mattered was living and being in that moment. Honestly, I feel like what I experienced that day was pure ecstasy...pure happiness.

--

The reason I find that story to be important is I am terrified that if I quit smoking weed, that I will never be able to experience it again.

--

I don't really know where I am going with this, but all I know is that deep down I want to quit, but I have never been able to do it. I feel like I try to quit every day, and by the time I get home I forget that I'm quitting and repeat the cycle.

I want to quit.

**Edit: Day 1**

Thank you to everyone for the responses. I have been looking forward to reading them all day, and I have finally got a moment to do just that.

This is the first time I have written down how I feel...I wrote my post when I was high, and honestly this has really blown the whole thing open for me.....I have not even craved smoking once today, but it is only day 1 and I expect it wont be this easy in the coming days.

After writing this post last night, I had trouble sleeping. I think its because this is the first time I have legitimately reached out for help. 

So thank you guys again, you have strengthened me greatly.

I finally made the leap to quit after reading a post on /r/leaves, reddit's marijuana quitting community. I can't find it anymore, but the poster said the following: Marijuana had treated him very well. It had brought him into a much more social and friendly community, where he had many adventures and great conversations with friends. He'd smoke socially on the weekends and have a great time. Then, slowly as he continued, he began to smoke during the week, still having great conversations and fun experiences socially. Then later, he began to smoke alone. As he smoked more frequently, he began to smoke to feel normal after a day, rather than getting high. It would put him in a comforting haze. The very act of smoking became something to look forward to. Worse, he found it difficult to be productive after he smoked, and stopped dreaming at night.

I related very strongly to that. I had spent two nights at home the week before and had remembered my bizarre dreams both nights. I enjoyed waking up with a fresh dream. I rarely got high anymore, the way I used to. So I decided to stop.

I talked to a bunch of my friends about it. My 3 roommates who had 3 weeks prior gone in on an ounce with me had run through their supplies, and were in no rush to reup. Rob had stopped as soon as I had stopped dealing, so he hadn't smoked in 2 months. Nick came to our house Thursday, and told me he had stopped too. With their support and commitment to stopping, I decided it was for the best. I decided I would only smoke on special occasions that truly called for it.

I quit on Wednesday. From /r/leaves advice, I told everyone I had quit the day before, as saying ""I quit yesterday"" is more powerful than saying, ""I'm quitting today"". On Thursday, we had a get together at our house and a few people wanted to smoke. I invited them to my room to use my bong but told them I wouldn't join them. We moved upstairs and they took over the conversation, challenging each other to a smoke off. Carl, a fairly straightedge kid who had smoked more in the last month than in the rest of his life, challenged his former coworker, an experienced smoker who was close with local rap artists, and the two went at it. Another guy joined in. They were having so much fun and dominating the scene that I felt compelled to join them, but Nick pointed out that there were just 3 of them, and everyone else was fine just drinking. And I didn't smoke.

After that, it became pretty easy. Tonight, Monday, I felt inspired to smoke while watching Bored to Death. I always wanted to be high when any character on the show was high. But I think it's better to relate to the sober, more active characters than the high, foolish ones. It took so long to buffer the episode that my roommate left, and without him smoking, I felt no desire to break my break.

I still have an eighth in my room that I haven't finished. The rest of my house is out, so I'll keep it tucked away for the right moment. But for now, being sober feels right.

My number one reason for quitting is that if I quit, I won't have to keep having this fucking debate with myself every day, every time I smoke. I will be able to work on something else, other than just keeping myself together. I will have the opportunity to thrive, rather than just function. I will be able to think and feel and experience without second-guessing myself and my perceptions. I've been high all the time for at least three years now - including at work. I really have lost touch with reality in some important ways. I've lost touch with what I want to do with my life and my time, I've lost touch with personal values. 


Pot is not evil - lots of people use it and experience it as a net positive in their lives. But I am not one of those people. It makes me anxious, paranoid, lazy, and then, depressed that I've done it to myself again. For a while, I claimed it was helping me be creative... but what good is being creative if you can't actually produce anything? I've tried to cut down and quit countless times over the past several years, but I have not been successful for more than a few days at a time, usually starting back at the very next opportunity. 

My pot use makes me feel out of control, and that is no longer tolerable.

1375148000.0,17,self.leaves,1jbhaq,3 week check-in; many repressed issues finally starting to surface,koolscrub003,19,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1jbhaq/3_week_checkin_many_repressed_issues_finally/,"Hey guys, its been exactly 21 days since I decided to move on from weed, and ... it's really been something. Before I jump into all the details of my current state of being, I'd like to preface it with the notion that I am infinitely more satisfied with my life on a day-to-day basis, and for the first time in longer than I can remember, I actually have aspirations for the future. With that said, this has been an emotionally eventful few weeks, yet I am truly optimistic that there is more ground to gain.

I believe that the majority of us here have been striving to end our habit because we feel that our life has stagnated in some respect. Our dependencies may have developed for varying reasons, but ultimately, they started to interfere with what we really wanted in our lives; thus, the problems ensued. Some of us were able to manage our weed usage and still maintain the progress society expects of us. Others fell into such a destructive cycle that eventually nothing seemed of any importance unless it involved getting high. I unfortunately fell into the latter group.

It was only near the end of my love affair with weed (3+ years of daily use) that I realized I was using solely to self-medicate my depression. A depression I never addressed nor acknowledged, for to the outside world, I seemed to be somewhat well-put together. As soon as I realized this revelation, I understood that I was never going to get out of this hole unless I stopped. So I did, but to be honest, stopping was the easy part. (FTR, I had tried and failed countless times prior to this attempt) As soon as I focused my energy on moving forward and not simply ""abstaining"", the idea of falling back down this hole seemed like the scariest thing in the world. Yet, I now realize that there is just so so much I have to address. And that is the terrifying part.

I am attempting to repair the relationships I had passed by during this journey, both friends and family. When I was a regular user, although I had enjoyed the camaraderie with my pothead crew, I could never shake the feeling that essentially everything that was discussed and referenced was simply ""fluff"". Now don't get me wrong, these experiences were undeniably enjoyable, but I eventually reached a place where the millions of thoughts racing through my head were enough to appease any feelings of loneliness or irrelevance that regularly emerged. Amidst this period, I broke up with an amazing girlfriend of multiple years, partly so I could smoke obligation-free, and partly because I felt like I was just dragging her down. She has a new boyfriend now, and although I realize that I may miss the feelings of comfort and companionship more than qualities specific to her, it still hurts and pangs, seeing that, people can always learn to love and open their hearts to another person. In some ways, I guess I strived to be a non-entity, so that I could be free from judgement and perceived insecurity, and not be a burden on anyone, yet when I finally reached that place, I realized that I had never been in such a dark place.

My depression and lack of self-worth stems from the fact that I feel like I have not met any of the expectations ever placed on me, both from myself and from others. If anything, my insistence on deflecting any feelings of self-pity have precipitated this influx of overwhelming guilt. Yet, my life, for all intents and purposes, has not been particularly difficult or trying. I am 22, about to graduate college this coming spring. My dad passed away from pancreatic cancer when I was 16 and I have ruptured both of my Achilles Tendons on separate occasions (Kobe's injury, for any basketball fans). My dad's death was a struggle, partly because I felt a responsibility to stay alongside my widowed mother (our household income has annually been under $20,000), but the Achilles injuries may have hurt my personal ideals more, for my whole life, I patterned my dreams and goals around achieving athletic success. Yet, despite these hurdles, I always look to maintain perspective because these issues are nothing compared to those who are less privileged (let alone warranting of any depression) Since I have quit weed, the clarity I have received in my head has helped me to zone in on exactly what I want in life.

Yet, I'm here now. No longer comforting myself to sleep with night after night of romanticized suicides. It hasn't been easy, but I do see now that putting the bong down may have been the most important decision I have ever made. Because I decided to stop giving up. Although I realize that I may have to adjust my expectations from this point on, I am no longer resigning myself to solely dwelling on the regrets of the past. And as for the future, I am now putting in the work TODAY to quell those anxieties and breed hope and optimism. And most importantly, I am trying my hardest to enjoy the current moment, to be appreciative for all the blessings I have been given. I could not have gained the perspective I needed had I continued to smoke. I guess I felt inclined to make this post because I wanted you guys to see that although there is a definite satisfaction from finally gaining some traction towards the life we want, it can still be a bumpy road. That those of you dealing with depression have to realize that just abstaining, is simply the initial step. If any of you guys are like me, depression often results in inactivity and apathy (I retreat back into my head, and although it may provide articulate and passionate thoughts, it is often not the most well-intentioned) so trying to get back on the horse is paramount. I hope that all you guys can find the motivation to take initiative and seize the life that you want. Despite the somewhat somber tone of this post, I want to assure you that I am in a better place than I have been in years; it is simply an emotionally trying ordeal attempting to address issues that I have repeatedly escaped time after time. Yet, there is such a rewarding quality in not taking the easy way out anymore. I have accepted that things are going to be hard, but I am not going to succumb anymore.

I've been smoking trees weekly to daily since I was 15, now I'm 18. It was always readily available to me and I never had to pay for it. I've always really liked weed, but lately it's just seem to make me fuzzy minded and panicky. I can't take these strait up panic attacks anymore. Last night i told my boyfriend of a year (who I primarily smoke with) that I don't like smoking anymore because it gives me panic attacks. He said I wasn't head strong, and I let my feelings dictate me. I told him feeling like I was going to die felt very real to me, and asked why would I want to do that to myself. He then went on about how he had a panic attack ONCE and it taught him that he has full power over his mind, and I don't . :( he flat out said my feelings were wrong, and if I had any self control I wouldn't have panic attacks. He then put the bowl he was smoking (I wasn't) in my face and tried to make me smoke it, I resisted. I really don't want to smoke anymore and I can't bring myself to do it. After 4 years I'm done, I feel like I've done permanent damage that I can only barely undo by reading books, educating myself, and excersize. I'm fucking done being a floormat, and smoking just because other people are. I'm done.

I have smoked it pretty consistently (16/17-24) and pretty heavily (1/2g-7g per week) with very few stoppages. I stopped once for 11 months and once for a month I was only smoking at the weekends. Out with that, I always have weed, and if I don't, I'm round at a friends house who does. 

I actually came onto leaves just over a week ago asking for advice on how to moderate my smoking. I had said I wanted to stop smoking as much weed. I said I had stopped for about 10 days and was planning on having a joint on Friday (which was now the Friday before last), in an attempt to be objective to what cannabis was doing to me and how it made me feel. Anyway, I did it. I know most of you will probably count that as a relapse, and possibly it was, but in my mind I genuinely wanted to do this not to get really high, but to rationally assess what cannabis does to me. So I did it. I rolled a joint and I smoked it. I didn't like it. All my anxieties I had been battling before and during cannabis abstinence were back, and they were INTENSE. Don't get me wrong. Initially I was high. I was laughing out loud at the TV. I was marvelling at my thoughts the way I used to, but then BAM, anxiety. I'm worrying. Ruminating. I can't really control my anxiety. I'm just going round in circles. I should add I'm quite an anxious dude at the best of times, and I actually stopped weed because of my anxiety, but this was intense. (Since stopping I have experienced pretty extreme anxiety - worse than the general anxiety I experience when smoking weed - Nausea, sweating, metallic taste in my mouth, short term memory loss, but nothing REALLY bad or verging on an actual panic attack.)

Anyway, during my high, I managed to get back to assessing what weed was doing to me, and I became very rational. My only answers were : making me anxious, and making me satisfied with being bored...and then it hit me...this is fucking stupid. For the next 25-30 minutes I pretty much convinced myself that weed just wasn't for me. It's not that I think it's a bad thing, I don't, but I just don't think it agrees with me anymore. I even rolled a one skinned and smoked that just to see if I got worse or better. It just made me sleepy and a little worse. I went to bed and woke up feeling really foggy and tired and in a bit of a 'stone over'. But I felt great. I felt empowered.

Previously when I had quite weed it had always because I felt I should, and not because I wanted to. And to an extent, even this time I felt this way. I was stopping because of my anxiety, not because I wanted to stop. But after my reflection I feel as though I have actually made a decision to stop because weed is not right for me. I convoked myself weed is bad for me so now I actually WANT to stop. I'm not really sure if this makes complete sense to everyone, but I guess what I am trying to say is that I feel I combatted my addiction to cannabis by convincing myself it was not good for me (whilst under the influence of it). Before I had convinced myself whilst sober, which meant I knew it wasn't right for me but I still craved it. Now the thought of smoking weed actually makes me feel anxious as opposed to before when the thought of not smoking it did. 

Also, since that day I have not smoked a single cigarette either. I actually didn't even realise I hadn't had a cigarette for about 3 days after... I think I closely related both cigarettes and weed in my reflections that I convinced myself they were both bad for me. I have had nicotine withdrawals however, but my positive frame of mind at the moment has meant that I'm not really tempted to relapse into cigarette smoking. I have the kind of rationale that I might as well deal with the withdrawals of nicotine just now when I'm dealing with cannabis withdrawal, and hit two birds with one stone. It's still pretty rough, but I'm getting there.

I also haven't really been keeping a solid count of how long I have been smoke free. I know that this weekend was my third weekend without smoking, but I'm not really sure of the exact date I stopped. This works well for me because I feel I can't fixate too much on my sobriety because actually haven't got a date say I stopped from, and thus haven't got a potential landmark date I can relapse on (eg. 100 days / 6 months etc). 

Now I'm not sure my method will work for others, but I just wanted to share it because I have tried stopping via different methods previously. I also wanted to share this with people because as I said I came over here a few weeks ago and explained my plans but I was told to go over to /r/petioles... I feel if I had taken this advice and embraced this alternate community I wouldn't have stopped and I'd have been back to my old ways in no time. 

Now I'm not saying this kind of method will work for everyone, but I just wanted to put out my story because I genuinely feel they way I have done this has been the easiest for me so far.

Today, I'm 3+ish weeks weed free (excluding last Friday) and 1+week tobacco free. I still feel anxious, but it's getting better. I feel far more awake, far more motivated and far more functional, and even though the withdrawals aren't great, they're receding, and every other aspect of my life has improved.

I've decided to quit.,CatCoveredToes,23,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1eprbt/pot_is_my_connection_and_disconnection_ive/,"Pot is my connection to family - both alive and dead; a way to have fun; a coping mechanism; reward; and what I said was a healthier way of dealing with intense/messed up/insane life experiences growing up.

I came from an interesting mish-mash of family. I have/had two older half brothers who shared the same mother as me but had a different father. I have an older sister who shares the same father but has a different mother. All that being said, we all were and are family. 

I was really close to my older brothers - sadly, the eldest one was incarcerated when I was 8 or so for a violent crime never to be released. I was about 20, the other brother also was incarcerated with minimal possibility of release. When I was about 21 or so, my eldest brother committed suicide in jail. 

There was more stuff growing up and I have had off and on times in therapy, read a bunch of Kubler-Ross, but really never felt relief.

Pot was my way to connect to both brothers, disconnect and make my brain stop working as hard. As I've grown older, I've stated it helps my creativity, does x or y.... but the reality is it's really tied to the family connection. Both brothers smoked. For me, though, the real pot + brother connection was with the younger of the two, M. I took to smoking as a way to think of him, be like him but better, and to be disconnected - which was sometimes the only way we could cope growing up with the pain we had.

He was the first one to get me high, we've shared a lot of intense life experiences, and I know that I think of him every time I smoke. 

15 years later and the longest break that I've ever taken is a month and that was years ago. Now in most recent years, I've done at most a week -- but it was a ""break"" or I will slow to once a day or every few days. 

I know it needs to stop. I have no ill will towards trees. I just need to stop to really move forward with life. I'm finally getting on a fast track towards my goals and am starting to see it as a confusing crutch that I don't need.

I know that the only thing that can truly bring me closer to him is to write him and visit him. Smoking slows the achievement of my goals and makes me tolerate substandard situations/people.  

Today, on my day off, I started my day with smoking a large bowl, felt odd, and when spelunking for a reddit that handled well.... quitting pot... and had never been more grateful for a subreddit.

I'm kinda at a loss as to where to start other than to say I've decided I want to stop smoking pot.

I feel weak. I've had a few severe panic attacks. But dammit I'm sober and because of that I feel good. I know I will continue to feel better physically as time goes on.

I couldn't have done it without r/leaves. You told me I could do it. You told me what to expect from withdrawals so I wasn't blindsided. You were here during the hardest time telling me ""it will end. You will feel better.""

The other thing I have to thank is AA. They are a community who understands me when no one else does. They know how to get sober because they have been there. No matter what the substance, the illness of addiction is the same. Sometimes I feel the weight of the world crushing down on my shoulders. That is literally what it feels like. And I go to a meeting and when I leave I can breathe. It doesn't fix my problems.  It doesn't take away the pain. But it eases the burden. It shows me the light at the end of the tunnel. 

I encourage anyone struggling with addiction to attend a meeting. It doesn't matter what it is: AA, NA, CA. It's the same program and they take your addiction seriously. No one says ""it's just weed"". No one says ""can't you just cut back?"" They get it. 

If you're skeptical because you're not religious, that's ok. Your higher power can be nature. It can be the universe. It does not have to be God or Jesus. I'm not a Christian and no one is trying to convert me. If I end up at a meeting that is super Jesus-y, I just don't go back to that meeting and I try another one next time.

As bad as this withdrawal is, I don't WANT to smoke anymore. If it makes me feel like this to quit, it's fucking bad for me. And I never dreamed that after a week I wouldn't even want it.

I don't know about you, my friends, but I don't want to end up like John. 50 years old, no family, no kids, no nothing. I don't think I've ever been so rattled in my life. Its never too late to make a change. Sadly I think for John, it just might be too late to start a family and what not. 

So I guess what I'm saying is, I highly recommend finding a meeting if you just can't seem to quit on your own, because I couldn't.

PS. i've even rolled a joint and gave it to my buddies and walked away for like 10 min, that's how close i was to relapse. for me relapse = death. honestly.

At the time, I was going to be leaving my job imminently (long story of its own; no, I wasn't fired), and I knew I wanted to clean up for any potential drug tests I might face in job searching. In my field, it's hit or miss: If I go to work for a large company, there could very likely be a drug test; there are plenty of smaller companies that will never test. But I don't want to take a chance. I have so many other things to worry about that I didn't want passing a drug test to be one of them. $

In the time since, I've accepted that I need to quit for good, but I didn't sweat that at the beginning.

It's taken some time to ramp up my job search. I was a bit depressed in January, so I didn't get too far. In February, I got myself in gear. I started to apply for a lot more jobs, and I was reaching out to a lot more people. 

Today, I have been scrambling to keep up with all of the messages I'm getting from friends and old colleagues. It's awesome! I feel like all of the work I've been putting in is starting to yield results: people sending me job postings, people making introductions at companies I'm interested in.

What does any of this have to do with smoking or not smoking?

I could not be doing any of this nearly so well if I was high.

Something I notice about my behavior is that I am replying to messages ASAP. I am organized and can pull together a resume or cover letter quickly. I can respond to an introduction or offer within minutes. 

When I was high, I would get emails and say, ""I'll get to it later,"" put a Gmail star on it and maybe looked at my starred messages next week. Maybe.

When I was high, I was numbing my dissatisfaction with my job. I got high before work and immediately after work, leaving no room to be doing real job searching with any kind of focus. 

Now, I am engaged and motivated and working hard. I am becoming the kind of person you'd want to hire. I always felt I had good skills and background that would make me someone you'd want to work with. But this new sharpness, quickness, alertness, and focus are all things a hiring manager would want on their team, in addition to my background and relevant skills.

I look forward to the day I can tell you Leaves that I have gotten a job. It will come.

I'm very open about my use, and I do not hide it from anyone. I don't smoke a lot. I can buy a quarter and have it last me two months. But I do smoke every day. Usually just enough to feel something, but every day nonetheless.

So I decided to try giving it up. Not as a temporary thing, but permanently. I recently returned from a week long trip on which I was not able to smoke. On the night that I got back, I smoked as I usually do, and I just didn't enjoy it. I had these overwhelming feelings of guilt for being high. I was ready right then and there to flush my stash and start a life of sobriety. But as I got to the bathroom, the paranoia set in. Why am I doing this? I'm not hurting anyone. I mean, I smoke less than a gram a week. I've got this under control. I even remember trying to rationalize not flushing it by convincing myself that it might clog the toilet. Defeated by my own high thoughts, I returned to my computer and proceeded to waste the rest of the night. The next morning, I logged onto my computer to find an open text file with three words typed out: ""Give it up.""

So the next morning, I actually did take my remaining stash and I flushed it. It took me almost half an hour to do, which further illustrated to myself that this needs to go. I stood over the toilet, open bag in hand, and just stared at the water. Not actually doing anything. It was at that point that I realized just how strong a grip it has on me. I mean, there was only a gram or two left in the bag, and where I come from that's only about $15-20 worth. It would be trivial to replace. But I remember the panic in holding the bag above the toilet. How long am I going to be able to last without it? Am I just going to go buy some more in a few days, or a week, or even a month or more? Should I just try quitting and keeping my stash out of sight? But in the end, down the crapper it went.

And now I'm here on day three. This is the time of day that I would usually smoke. The first couple nights were tough, but I'm having an especially hard time tonight. As we speak, I have a text message typed and ready to send to my dealer. I remember the feelings of guilt and shame that I had just three nights ago. But right now I just don't care. 

Until now, I've never really felt like an addict. I just thought I liked to smoke a little bit in the evening to take the edge off the day. Even when I was on my week long trip, it didn't bother me to be without pot. But having flushed my stash, and having made the decision to stop, now I feel panicked. It is so easy to rationalize smoking, especially because I don't feel that I smoke a lot. 

I haven't told anyone that I know that I am trying to quit. I really don't want any of the ""Good for you!"" bullshit. I'm not doing this for anyone else, I'm doing this for me. I'd rather tell people when I am convinced that I've quit.

I'm not sure what I was hoping to get out of this post. But it has kept me from sending the text message to my dealer. Even if this is just a cathartic exercise for me, if it helps, it helps.

It's been about 36 hours.  Stressful day today.  I'm home alone with some trees and a Volcano.

Long story:

I've had several affairs with trees over my life.  I thought it was the best thing when I was in high school, but my supply was far from steady and I got in to more dangerous drugs.

I actually barely used in college at all.

In my late 20's, for a year, I used almost every night, fresh hydroponic stuff with a Volcano.

There were a few other times, but I went for long periods of not using (I was a moderate drinker instead), mostly because the laws suck.

So now I'm back in a very tree-friendly environment: it's practically legal here, I have my own place, I have trees, and I have a Volcano.  I've been using every night for the past month, mostly by myself.

It was cool for a while, but now I know it's causing some negative side-effects.  In the day time, I notice increased fogginess, laziness, and impaired memory.  And when I'm high at night, it sometimes feels kind of like a bad trip.

I'm 32, and a successful entrepreneur.  My life and work are entirely in my hands.  I'm leading a big new project which is hard and requires me to be at full functioning every day.  Further, I'm single and need to improve my social life: staying home stoned every night and then being foggy-brained every day just doesn't work.

I didn't use at all yesterday -- the first time in a month -- and I managed to sleep decently anyway even though I was feeling more antsy than usual. So I'm proud of that.  But today is a new day, and there are many stressful issues at work.

I don't think I'll relapse today, but it feels good posting my little struggle here.

I have to say, I think this might be about the longest I've ever gone without since I started smoking heavily about 8 years ago. It was a bit rough at first, but it's slowly getting easier. My wallet is much fatter, my dreams are back, and I no longer feel the constant nagging urge to get back to a safe location where I can burn one down. My girlfriend says I've changed a lot for the better, even though I don't always feel that way.

My mood has been pretty spotty lately, as I no longer have my favorite chemical to dull my emotions and wrap me in that comfortable apathy I grew to rely on so well. I've been noticing a lot more fucked up things going on in the world lately, and it's been a bit of a process relearning how to live on this planet. It's been a roller coaster ride so far, but I'm hoping that it's my brain readjusting and it will improve over time.

I've been spending some time meditating, which does seem to help a bit. One awesome benefit is that I can actually read again! When I was  smoking it would take me weeks or longer to finish a book, but lately I've been tearing through them in a way that I haven't done in a long time.. I thought I was self-medicating for my ADD, but I actually find I can focus much better when I'm not stoned.

I'm a musician, and for a long time one of the main things that kept me from stopping was a sense of dread that I wouldn't be able to play well without it. At first, I did lose my motivation to pick up my guitar.. after a couple weeks I started playing again, and to my surprise, I am just as good as before, if not better! My fingers react faster, my mind just intuitively knows what to do, and it just seems to take less effort. It's much easier for me to pick out the key of a song now. I used to get so stoned that it actually made jamming more difficult believe it or not. Too much weed really did make me dull and slow, way more than I realized even in the depths of my suffering.

I still have cravings now and then, especially with the Pacific Northwest rainy season starting up. But I notice that these always pass, and once they do smoking really loses its appeal. I just remember all the times I've relapsed in the past, and how shitty I felt afterwards, and it becomes much easier to get past them. I think the hardest part so far is the loneliness. It really sucks that none of my ""friends"" have hit me up at all this past month.. Oh well, I was/am just as addicted as they are, and I know what it's like to be in their situation. Still hurts a bit, but I have compassion for them.

I am successful, married and no one but me put the pressure on to quit. My wife knew when she married me and has *never* put any kind of pressure on me to quit.

When I first started smoking, it was like a wave a relief. I have had social anxiety forever and I never did anything about it. I never went to a therapist or took medication, I just accepted that I will be like that forever. When I was 24, I decided to try weed and everything changed. I felt no anxiety for the first time, and I was so happy. I used weed as medication for my anxiety for a while. Then after a year or so, I became very depressed. I was not happy with my job, myself or my life. I used weed to escape from reality, very successfully. 

For 3 years I lived alone, smoke every day, watched hundred of tv shows and movies and became more depressed. Weed no longer helped my anxiety or depression, but it did work for forgetting about everything. I began taking xanax as a supplement to weed for anxiety. That worked even better for blocking out my problems and postponing my priorities. Whenever I would go anywhere, I would have to smoke and take xanax. My anxiety was worse than ever. 

Within the past year I have stopped taking xanax, started working out, NoFapping, and the last obstacle is stopping smoking. I already feel so much better, but I know in order to really get where I want to be I have to stop smoking. I still smoke every night, it is a ritual, and I have to smoke in order to sleep. I have stopped for a week a couple of times, but each time I smoke again, I go right back to the routine. The thing is, I don't want to quit completely and never smoke again. I just feel like I am doing it for all the wrong reasons, and I need to take a long break to reassess for feelings towards marijuana.

So here I am. I found this sub today and I see these people just like me. As with NoFap, it is very motivating to see people in the same position as you. Thank you, and good luck.

This video made all the difference for me. I was struggling my first two days. Bad appetite, puking when trying to eat, felt miserable and depressed. But this morning I watched this video my brother showed me. And I think it can directly relate to a lot of us.

Some things I just want to point out in the video and elaborate on:

""Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate, our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure"" - This spoke to me because I had lost my motivation. I was scared I was missing out on the potential I could achieve. 

""This kids gonna be the best kid in the world.
This kids gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew."" - Spoke to me strongly as well because that was something I would've said before I started smoking a shit ton. I wanted to be president of the US, and become a doctor. I am now more driven to do those things than I have been in the past year as well.

""But somewhere along the line, you changed. You stopped being you. You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you youre no good, and when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame, like a big shadow."" - For this, and I think many of us, we noticed we lost ourselves somewhere along the way of our excessive use of marijuana. For me, I knew I lost myself. I didn't care as much about the people I loved. If I couldn't quit for me, then I damn well had to quit for the people I cared about. My mom was so happy to hear I was going to stop, it almost drove me to tears. I didn't truly realize how bad I was affecting my future, family and friends and was trying to escape using weed.


I really hope this helps somebody here who is going through a hard time. Stay strong my friend, you'll get through this. And you'll see the joys of life once again soon.

If you really want to quit then understand it takes a lot of change. For me I had to turn off my phone for awhile. I DESTROYED all my smoking utensils. I didnt give them away to my friends because I had to destroy the things that destroyed me and did not want future access to them. I had to cut a few ties of friendships. Had to express to people they needed to be supportive and not try to bring me back into the party lifestyle. 

I planned out my first three days of the change. I go to therapy and planned to have my third day, be the day of my appointment. That helped me but you can arrange these days how you want. Understand that stress comes around but only in PASSING moments and you can defiantly handle them with exercise (thats what i chose). 

Music is absurdly helpful. Drink tons of water also! I switched from coffee to Green Tea because of the anti-oxidents and metabolism. Bananas help me as well. Re-embrace activities you did as a child. You werent born addicted or high and im sure you were a lovely happy child. I swam a lot as a child and thats what I love to do a few times a week as well as daily walks with my headphones, exploring my town. 

Do some research on withdrawal to a lot of stress is common but theres ways to overcome it. 

I know your views might seem bleak and have low-patience for the world. But sobriety opens up new ways to look at life. Just stay strong you can do this! ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_x37we,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/x37we/day_24_of_overall_sobriety_no_booze_either/,

I'm an 18 year old male, in between my freshman and sophomore year of school at a large public university. Its been exactly six months since the last time I smoked weed (7 January 2012). 


I grew up a lot after I quit. I began to realize that I was wasting my life messing around and getting high with my friends. After quitting, I lost most of my old friends (at school and at home) and began to spend much of the winter by myself. This led me back to my lifelong paranoia/anxiety, causing me to fail one of my major classes (Its hard to go to class when you're afraid to leave your room) and switching from a math/philosophy double major to business. As spring rolled around, my anxiety eased off because I started drinking more, as well as finding god (a strange mix, I know). Eventually, drinking won out. I stopped going to my church on campus and began to drink heavily through the end of the school year. This lead me to do things I never really pictured myself doing (random sex, showing up to work/class drunk, etc.), most of which I regret. I made it through the year, mostly because my easy business classes allowed me to blow off schoolwork and still get decent grades.


Now, I'm spending my summer taking a few classes while working full time in fast food. I don't have a car, and I commute to college with my mother, who works on campus. I haven't seen any of the friends I have left in almost two months. I don't leave my house except for work and school. I brought a few bottles of liquor home from school and drink to fall asleep most nights.


I was in a similar situation last summer, but I smoked and had a car. I spent a lot of time by myself but was much happier, spending most of my days stoned drawing, making music, going on adventures or smoking with my girlfriend (at the time). There were times when I got scared, lonely, or depressed, but I felt like I could deal with it and the weed helped.


 I don't really have that now though. I'm really struggling to adjust to life without weed, even after six months. Weed made me feel happy and numb, kept me motivated and satisfied. I can't deal with things now; I'm not easy-going any more and the smallest things can just ruin me for a few days. 


I'm proud that I made it 6 months without weed, but my life went to shit after I quit: I lost a lot of my friends, my GPA dropped from a 3.67 to a 2.55 and I stopped working out (I used to make myself go to the gym once for every bowl I smoked and I got in great shape really quickly). I quit two majors, found and lost my faith in god, started having anxiety attacks again, missed out on a chance with a girl I'd liked for months (she smokes, I don't), and got sick 3 separate times (not weed related, but that shit sucked). On the bright side, I spent less money, met a few new friends and have a different outlook on life.


I've made it six months without weed though, and that feels pretty good. The past six months have been the hardest of my life. I don't think I wasted them, but I lost most of the things I was working on, and I've had to start from scratch. I wake up most days just wanting to give up; not just weed, but life in general. I don't think I'm going to smoke tomorrow, I'm going to wake up and keep going.


Tl;Dr: No weed changed my life drastically, and having to start over is really taking its toll on me.

1340948125.0,18,self.leaves,vs6ym,31 years old.  Been a daily smoker for over a decade. Gone a little over a month without.,BindOnClick,22,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/vs6ym/31_years_old_been_a_daily_smoker_for_over_a/,"I really like getting high.  My daily routine was to smoke a bowl when I got up, smoke a bowl after walking the dog.  Sometimes bring weed to work and smoke at lunch, and then come home to smoke bowls throughout the evening.

I prided myself on how functional I was when I was high.  I felt like I could accomplish any task well.  I taught myself to be a web developer, largely while high, and could get into some really great zones while coding high.

I contemplated quitting for a long time, but whenever the sack ran out, I'd panic, and would always get more within a day.  Or, if I had to wait, I'd scrape and smoke resin until I could get more.  I knew from previous breaks that the panic would subside within a day or a couple days, but I always gave in.

It became exhausting to keep up that routine.  I felt like a slave to weed in a way, and would plan my life around being able to smoke.  I always had to have visine on me and would get paranoid if I forgot it.  I would forgo eating properly or saving money in order to spend money on weed.  And I let relationships dwindle in favor of keeping my relationship with weed.

When I reached the end of the sack a month ago, I decided not to get more.  On top of just being exhausted with it, I landed a great job at that time, and that added to my motivation.  I haven't had any major cravings really, except a few nights when I've been drunk.  I drink a couple beers when I get home, which provide a similar relaxation that the bowls used to.

The dreams have been intense.  For the most part I'd just stopped dreaming when I smoked, but they've come back in full force.  I like it, but sometimes they're really powerful, and it feels like I'm battling my demons.

All in all I feel a lot more on point.  I feel like I'll be able to tie up the loose ends in my life and keep my shit straight.  I've smoked once, on a weekend since quitting, and I'm okay with that.  I think I might be able to smoke occasionally as long as I don't purchase or own it myself.  Hopefully my friends will be content with me repaying them in beers.  I quit smoking cigarettes 5 years ago and know that I can never have another one, but I think weed might be different.  I'm hoping I can find a balance with it.  All I can say though, is that after a decade of smoking almost daily, it feels good to be going through life with a clearer head.

All of my best friends the past 3 years were a year above me, and are now attending the local community college. In this last year, they started smoking a lot, getting up to 4-5 times daily. We had always been a steady unit together, but in the last year a lot of that has changed.

Slowly, I stopped hearing from them. It wasn't that they were ignoring me in any means, but their constant smoking pushed me to the side. To compensate for this, I would hang out with them as much as I could on the weekends and would pretty much smoke constantly. By the time Sunday night would roll around, I would be a wreck, dreading the coming week.

The weekdays had a weird feeling to them, as if I was floating through a haze and not really taking in everything that was happening. I felt almost no emotions and couldn't enjoy simple things the same as before. I lost interest in a lot of the things that I had previously loved. In a way I almost felt as if I had lost my best friends, because I wouldn't see or hear from them at all during the week. 

I refused to smoke alone, and I wasn't allowed to hangout during the week, so that meant a grind to get to the weekend every week. Some of the weeks were harder than others. I remember one particular week was the most depression/anxiety I had ever felt in my life. Waking up and going through the motions was seemingly impossible, I couldn't talk to anyone. I was entirely trapped in my thoughts and felt incredibly lonely in the world. 

Things have gotten better since then, and my friends have been starting to cut down on their use. Lately, I haven't been able to enjoy smoking as much as before, it only causes me to examine myself from a negative perspective and have existential breakdowns. I realized that smoking has become way too big a part of my life and I can't enjoy responsible use anymore.

It's time to quit.

Today is Day 8!,,21,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/rpkh6/i_made_it_a_week_today_is_day_8/,"I don't think I could have done this without this community. I've read and upvoted every post, and everyone's story has resonated with me in some way. I am sure this is essentially the same experience I could have gotten going to NA/MA, though I am still tempted to seek out an NA/MA meeting so that I can meet new people, and I am so grateful that there is such a nurturing and understanding community on reddit---especially when so many other parts of reddit seem weighed down with people who just seem to want to be mean for no reason.

Yesterday was fairly uneventful. My only real emotional 'trouble' yesterday was when I gave someone advice on /r/ukulele to not give up on their ability to sing, and to believe in themselves. I guess my kindness learned from this subreddit bled over. Little did I know, the reaction to me encouraging this guy to not give up would be responded to with scorn. I was told that ""being encouraging is not relevant or productive"" by two other people, and I was downvoted each time I responded. I didn't understand.

I said this in response:

&gt; When I hear someone being unnecessarily critical of themselves and giving up on something I try to encourage them to not give up. It's just how I am, and it's what I would want people to do for me. To me, ""don't give up on yourself"" is relevant advice. I guess the ""golden rule"" has no place on reddit.

I got downvoted for that. Can you believe that? It's so upsetting. Apparently ""being nice"" isn't the appropriate reaction to have to someone who is selling themselves short. Even this morning, I'm still completely baffled, and pretty hurt about it. ([If you're curious, here's the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukulele//comments/rngyw/playing_fully_instrumental_melody_and_harmony/).) I guess people just assume when someone says ""I'm terrible at something"" you should just let them believe that they are terrible and reinforce that opinion, but I know from experience that anyone can do basically anything as long as you tackle it with the right mindset.

So that only confirmed my belief that reddit is not a very nice place to 'hang out' on the internet, especially not for my 'mental health'. I don't particularly want to learn to NOT be kind and encouraging to people, so... whatever. This is why I don't subscribe to any subreddits anymore but this one and the two that I created. I thought I could add /r/ukulele to that list but I guess I was wrong. I got kind of depressed about this and ended up taking a nap for a couple hours, but of course when I woke up there were more negative comments about how I should just shut up or whatever.

Since I've started to feel pretty much normal most of the time---I am regularly drinking water without much trouble; the gnawing feeling in my stomach has finally gone away; any sort of residual high or cloudiness has mostly passed entirely---I've turned my attention to a friend I knew from high school who recently lost his job, and just like me, because of his own actions. He seems to be in the same position I was in ten months ago, depressed about the state he got his life into, smoking tons of weed and trying to distract himself from his depression.

I'm trying to encourage him to quit smoking, and pursue his artistic aspirations. It's sad listening to him try to give up: He'd like to be a photographer, but 'any moron with a camera can do that so why bother'; he'd like to make movies, and says he has original ideas, but 'meh'. I'm going to try to be a positive influence in his life and see if I can affect some real change, because he's clearly unhappy with the way he is right now. Similar to me, he's started exercising frequently so he's already on the right track, it shouldn't be too hard to nudge him 'toward the light' as it were.

A guy on Twitter is trying to expose me to hip-hop because he's decided that only listening to all the indie rock shit I listen to isn't cool enough. He kept asking me questions and sending me youtube videos of hip-hop songs until he landed on this one: [Language Arts Crew - The Eye](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDWN49FDiyo&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player) which I actually like a lot. So much in fact, it's made me wonder if I should try to learn to rap so I can make similar music. I tried yesterday to record a cover of a song on my ukulele, and after an hour and take after take after take I couldn't manage to sing it right... so maybe rapping is the answer, I definitely have the vocabulary for it. Something for me to ponder and experiment with. I told my buddy mentioned above that I was thinking about this and he said ""you being a rapper? I have as much of a chance of being President"" to which I said: Dude, there's no reason you couldn't be President, if you tried, and there's no reason I couldn't be a rapper. No reason to kill a dream before it's even been attempted...

I'm a late bloomer when it comes to trees, and I really only started about two years ago when I was 24. I was initially drawn to try trees for the advertised health benefits: better sleep, more appetite, mediating ADHD…etc. And it delivered; I could fall asleep blissfully, I put an additional 20 pounds on my skinny frame, and I found that during the day I had better focus on my projects at work.


But that wasn't what drove me to quit.


Lately things have been piling up, despite my attempts to control my intake and simplify my life. I tried limiting myself to smoking on Friday and Saturday nights, but inevitably I would justify the use during the week, rationalizing that I had accomplished X amount of work today, and that I was rewarding myself. I resigned myself to the fact that I would smoke almost every day and I tried to control what time I was allowed to smoke as a reward (usually 9:00 pm). But eventually that failed too: I'd come home, make a list of goals and chores to do and reward myself at the end with some trees, but that failed too. I would rationalize why something on my list could be put off to the next day, or the weekend, or later and later and later.


Essentially, weed became the driving force behind my procrastination.


I've fallen behind at work, at home, with friends, with my family, with my hobbies, with my fitness, and with sleep. I was never a big user either. I'd take maybe one or two hits from my MFLB at the end of the day and play some video games. My original goal of going to sleep at 11:00 pm was compounded by weed and games, and it turned into 12:00 am, 1:00 am and sometimes even 2:00 am. I'd go to work with dark bags under my eyes because of lack of sleep, and explain to my boss and co-workers that I was stressed because of excuse X. Weeks sped by when I smoked daily, and I became a hermit. I lost my mental acuity, my joie de vie. I became depressed, I tried to hide it from my roommates and my partner.


But I discovered you, /r/leaves. And your stories allowed me to discover the cause of it all: marijuana.


So I did a trial run. I quit over spring break and managed 10 straight days without trees. I felt fantastic. I accomplished my weekly goals, from fitness to finances to friends. Things were balancing out. But I slumped, and fell back into daily use. The slump lasted an entire month where I slowly watched all my progress spiral back down the drain. So that brings us to last weekend. Disgusted by the fact that I was throwing my life away, I packed everything up, all my toys, my stash, everything. I cleaned my room and I'm working on my house. In fact, I've decided to put in notice to my landlord this month and find somewhere new to live.


I'm starting fresh.


I'm going to step up in almost every aspect of my life. I'm cutting away the fat and giving myself more free time. I'm setting clear goals about how I use that free time, and it's all towards personal and professional improvement. For the past three days, I've been tearing my old life apart and throwing out the rot. Today feels like I've broken through, and I'm reaping the rewards. I'm full of energy, excitement and life. Despite being ""sober"" everything seems clearer, more colorful, more intense.


I feel like a beginner again.

It made me remember something a counselor said to me when I was in rehab -- she was an older woman who was an alcoholic, clean for forty years.

Her point was that it's not enough to say that alcohol/drugs are a way of dealing with stress or relaxing after a hard day.  It's more accurate to say that they are a way of *quickly* dealing with stress or relaxing after a hard day.

Rather than use a natural way to change your emotions, or letting them change on their own, you are using a substance to ***order*** them to change ***right now.***

She called it ""playing Napoleon with your emotions"" -- acting like a little general and instructing your feelings on how they should be.  Her opinion was that eventually your feelings react like anything constantly being ordered around.  They rebel and try to screw you back.

Its not quite going how I expected, so I'm hoping there are some people out there that might be able to relate to what I'm going through.

A brief history, I was smoking for about 10 years before I quit back in September. I had an MMJ card, and was a daily user. I ended up quitting because I couldn't help thinking it'd be good for me and I'd be more outgoing, active, have better memory, etc by quitting. I quit once my MMJ card expired. 

The first month was certainly the worst. Two weeks in I had terribly bad sleeping problems, mostly affected by very disturbing, vivid dreams that would ruin a night's sleep. I kept feeling incredibly bored and was still quite unmotivated to do things. As expected I was also fairly moody and was pretty grumpy most of the time. 

About the second month in, the problems with dreaming went away. I still felt bored all the time but at least got out to the gym more often. I actually gained 10 lbs since I've quit which I think is because I'm eating meals more consistently and also have been drinking a lot more to fill in the gap of not smoking. Its really not a great habit, but I honestly drink a hell of a lot more when I'm not smoking. 

I was really hoping I'd be more motivated by now and would be turning more outgoing, but the last month has been pretty hard. I feel like I've slipped into a depression and not much as really changed for the better now that I've stopped smoking aside from normal sleep. I still sit around a lot, drink more, and am incredibly unmotivated to do things. I almost feel like I was more motivated when I was smoking because I wanted to go do things during the day, and reward myself with a smoke at the end. I'm not sure if this newfound depression I'm in is because I don't have the drug, or the drug was covering up the fact I'm depressed, or it was actually helping me be less depressed.

Part of the reason I wanted to touch base here was to see if anyone after taking a lot of time off I feel like I'm in even more of a funk and still very unmotivated after quitting smoking. It sounds almost stupid, I know, but that's the situation I've found myself in. In the last week or so I've felt like I want to smoke more now than I ever did during the first month of quitting. Its basically getting harder for me not to relapse because I find myself thinking I miss it and was actually helping me more than it was hurting. Am I crazy?

I don't know if I need to stay clean longer and this will pass, or that I was incorrectly associating weed for causing depression and lack of motivation since it seems to be worse now quite a while after quitting. Anyway, I've written a nice wall of text and I wanted to see what the community thought. Any advice/help is appreciated. Thanks!

**tldr:** After 75 days I'm still pretty unmotivated, a bit depressed, and drinking a lot. Having a lot of thoughts about smoking again

It's not that I haven't met anyone I like but rather that I haven't met anyone similar to myself. Applying to my school was an afterthought, but as the letters came in the mail, it was clear it would be where I would be spending the next few years.


I don't want to say I'm unhappy, because I'm not. Every day I'll make sure to include a fun activity, whether it be walking, going on bike rides,  smoking, or playing guitar. But I still feel genuinely out of place. Frankly, I feel like I haven't aged at all since August. It's as if everyday is a dream, and that one day I'll wake up and I'll get to start school over. Time passes way to quickly. It's the sort of thing where you'll try to remember what you did yesterday and you won't remember. I'm set on transferring schools at the end of the year but it doesn't really give me any relief. I've had a few awful experiences before and I convinced that it's become a problem again. However I'll put it this way: I've never been more depressed, and life has never been more beautiful. I spend more time now than ever simply thinking about how improbable my life is, going out into the woods and absorbing the amazing world in which we live in. Which brings me to my final point:

Last night I met up with 5 friends from my high school for dinner and coffee. I had smoked about 3 hours earlier and although the depth of my high was in the walk into town to meet them I was still a bit detached from them, and I kept quiet for most of our meet-up, which lasted for a few hours, except for an occasional comment which they would find humorous. Hearing about all of their crazy college adventures, meeting tons of cool people and going to parties (I can't drink this year because of tuberculosis medication), made me genuinely envious but I didn't really show it. In fact I didn't really show them anything. However I could see how off they thought I was. Even we were hanging out in my dorm room I didn't participate that much in the conversation. At about 9 they left and I must have cried for about half an hour, something I don't do very often, before falling asleep for almost 12 hours.

I honestly have no idea what I think about marijuana. On the one hand, I feel that if it didn't help me find life beautiful, I probably would have dropped out of school or become suicidal. However, I also feel it only perpetuates my social isolation. I've tried to make it into a social activity but I go to an Ivy league school where very few people smoke and many are super judgmental about smoking and will get mad if you stink up the hallways. Even most of my high school friends have stopped smoking, just because it's not a big scene at their respective schools, and they all now drink a ton.

On the bright side my short-term memory has DRASTICALLY improved. My ability to do logical thinking and math has improved (important in my line of work). I thought I needed weed to think deeply, but I have had many deep, profound thoughts while sober.

I Essentially failed out of college while still being enrolled. I have taken time off. When I did , I took pot along for the ride and it as possibly the most unmotivated time in my life. I started caring more when I ran out. I found more and fell back into my old pattern, even buying more devices and such.

 Having stopped smoking voluntarily ( cigarettes and pot) and exercising, I have noticed I care more. It's still a chore to leave bed in the morning, but it's not in a pot haze. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, and medicate with alcohol in social situations. ( figure its the same as benzodiazepines which I half-want my therapist to prescribe but I still want to be me') alcohol ftw I guess. I'm not an alcoholic, but it sure helps me talk to people, it removes my anxiety filter that makes me think forever about everything.

Anyway 

I'm returning to school, and I finally have an ideas about who I want to be when I am my parents age. I feel like I grew up. I hope this feeling lasts. It has to; I want it to; I need it to.

I really need to stop because at this point, I smoke bowl after bowl, joint after joint, and barely feel anything anymore. I don't get high, I get ""normal"". It's horrible. My wife is getting fed up of me smoking like Snoop Dogg, but my mind keeps justifying picking up another bag. It's seriously hard to go more then a few hours without trying to figure out how im going to pickup. If I have it, I'll smoke it. If I have none, I'll find it. If I don't, I feel irritated, anxious, and just horrible.

I realize I just need to man up and stop being a pussy, that after a week or so I'd be feeling great, but I'm not in a good place right now. My father passed away suddenly over christmas (he was 55, it was a huge shock) and I've been having a hard time getting back on the horse, so to speak. Three weeks ago, my doctor took me off work indefinably, and I might be starting medication next week, so while this is in the process of being taken care of, I'm kind of a mess right now.

edit: I smoked a bowl wednesday morning, and thats it. I'm out and I'm constantly fighting the urge to go pick some up. I think it's kind of a blessing (to me) that my main, uber reliable (in the two years i was calling him 4+ times a week I can count on one hand the times he couldnt help me) hookup got busted last month, so now i need to rely on buddies to score for me with their hookups. I'm just trying to take a few days off to see how I feel afterwards. I do an hour of stationary biking in the morning, and I think its helping, a bit. Thankfully I have some Trazodone perscribed by my doctor (trouble sleeping related to anxiety), and that puts me out, but I wake up in the middle of the night without any possiblity of getting back to sleep.

Bleh, I'm going to be okay, I just hope I can hold on a few more days. I havnt taken a break of more then 2-3 days in the past 3-4 years, so this is rough. But I can do it. Thanks for all the good advice, Leaves!

I dont know if I can control myself anymore, I dont want to smoke but I want to...

Today I just got paid, my dealer called me and said he would give me 3 grams for 10 dollars (usually they sell for 5 a gram). I knew I shouldn't have bought it but it was a really good deal. After work I went to buy ingredients for spaghetti carbonara because I wanted to treat myself after a hard week of work. I just drank a 2 cup of mango juice and ate half a mango. I know I shouldn't smoke. 

This whole week for me, I just wake up, go to work, go home sleep. Tomorrow classes begins for me so i would go to school monday to thursday then work the weekend. I feel so trapped and stressed. I guess I'm really an addict. Trying to find reasons so I can smoke.

I feel like there are two part of me. One that doesn't want to smoke while the other wants to. I have my vaporizer ready, grinded up the weed, about to cook something good, and have a manga ready to read. I dont know what to do. It would be so relaxing just to smoke and relax and not to worry about life...

* Using more marijuana than was intended;

Had a pretty depressed days after my birthday when everybody tried to make me feel special and happy with their fake affection, and it doesn't help lying in bed all day and the only two things I can think about are weed and suicide.

Things were actually starting to improve in the past couple of days, but I just never see the positives in life, it's all just negative bullshit and that shit has been tearing me up long before I started smoking. I always think other shit has to change first before I can stop relying on drugs to deal with stress, and that's probably wrong, but life sucked even when I didn't smoke weed or did drugs. 

Fortunately, I hated it from the beginning I lit up, and now I try not to hate myself for being so weak and not in control of myself. Luckily I didn't start thinking that I could manage smoking everyday and still get my life back on track like all the other times I relapsed. It's not going to happen, and this time was different because it was a very negative experience. I wish I could just forget about yesterday and today would be day 22.

So why do I have to torture myself with this self improvement shit? I stopped smoking cigarettes, started lifting weights, running, all of that while smoking every day, but it never seems enough. Sobriety isn't good enough, and drugs are the devil. I'm tired of settings all these goals for myself and failing at every one of them. I'm still bored by everything I do.

It is pretty much a sub category of chronic depression which puts me at risk for major depressive episodes.  
Now lets get to the good part.  He prescribes me a medication called Lexapro that is supposed to aid my moods/emotions and anxiety.  I was obviously entirely honest with him about my habits and told him that I get a lot of pleasure from smoking weed multiple times a day, and that sadly it has turned into one of the few things I still find pleasurable in life.  He told me that I need to cut out weed completely, because it is very counterproductive to the medication.  Simply put he pretty much said, ""stop smoking weed or I cannot treat you.""  When he first said it i swear my heart skipped a beat and my world came crashing down.  ""My only outlet to a better mindset is now gone, I am officially one of those boring everyday people who live to work and then die.""

I can feel it restricting me in life, but I'm having difficulty finding motivation to stop.


I feel like I'm a lot different than most who are trying to quit. The biggest thing is that my life is pretty much going where I want it to.


I've been successfully involved in bodybuilding for a few years now. I just had my first paid modeling gig. I just got promoted to server at work. I recently started going steady with a pretty, intelligent blonde girl. I finally quit smoking cigarettes a couple months ago. I even got off zoloft in the past couple weeks (best thing I have done, was on it for 2.5 years). I just signed a lease to a dream apartment. I'm going to an awesome university majoring in something I love, which is dietetics. I'm a very motivated person (get my workouts in everyday, get my meals in, and I'm a neatfreak.) 


But I smoke weed everyday. About 2-3 blunts. Probably the worst part is the cost. Prices in Baton Rouge are steep ($380 an ounce,) but I make good money waiting tables so it isn't too bad. I fucked up in school last semester, but that was more because of a really rough breakup - though not smoking I could probably do better.


I have pretty bad anxiety and depression, which is why I was on the zoloft. I don't think I could have gotten off that terrible drug if it wasn't for marijuana. But now, if I don't smoke for a few days, and have too much time to think, the anxiety comes in full force, along with suicidal thoughts, not just depression.


Basically, I'm confused. I know I should quit, but I don't have much reason to except that nagging in the back of my head. My relationships with others would probably also be better if I wasn't stoned so frequently.


The biggest factor is probably that I pride myself in the fact that I'm a disciplined bodybuilder, but I smoke weed. Which is very rare. Between the laziness and munchies, most people can't do it. 


I never had a rebellious phase, so maybe this is my way of doing it. I'm not really sure. I don't even know what I really want.


I've never posted anything on reddit, except maybe a nutrition post or two. But it feels good to vent, as I never have on here or trees. I appreciate your reading of my wall of text.

From best friend to ball and chain

your devious, addicting ways were hidden in every blaze

It's no wonder your name is Mary

from you moment you entered my life you became my wife




I admit there were Absolute affairs 

Jameson almost gave me a son 

and when I didn't come first, turned to Southern Comfort

never saw I was a mess, more like your highness

hanging with Crown Royal just to feel restored

I couldn't help but go Captain Morgan overboard




I'm only 15, too young for these relationships

so I jump ship to Alice and Wonderland trips

there is where I'd sneer at my fears, yet when I awake

back in my own bed, back in my own head

I'm wishing I'd roll over dead

I roll over and roll you instead

I thank you, my green sticky goddess, for you replace the painfullness

the only hurt I feel is when I speak, in my cheeks

my smile goes for miles



I solemnly swear you're the key but with more feelings to flee

it's no shock I sin out of wedlock

it wasn't 'til the sex on X had me bouncing checks

that I heard a voice tell me to stop

it wasn't loud like an alarm clock, more like small talk

so I minimize my use, think of every excuse

to keep you by my side, keep you as my bride




you lifted me high

together we floated by the bullshit, the fits and the fights

a bright light in the night making everything alright




then true tragedy and turmoil struck, you were no longer enough

went on a hunt for a partner stronger than a blunt

still taking puffs but I'm leaving residue on foil

this stuff is rough, I don't feel so blue, just like I have the flu

I'm not down for the brown, I need a new routine




return back to the green, my one true queen

but giggles soon turn to gripes

it doesn't take long 'til I'm switching ice in a bong for ice in a pipe

why introduce me to meth? Are you wishing me death?

just wanted to chill like Cheech and Chong




putting the blame on you is wrong

my infidelity is infinite

I won't go into detail but as I inhale

I'm eye-fucking these lines I'm about to rail

I know this has to end

we can't be lovers and we can't be friends

look at the paths we traveled, the relationships we unraveled

it's time for me to mend



I admit it's scary without you, Mary

I don't know anything else, let alone myself

but I'm breaking my vows

trying not to reminisce on our last kiss

because you're truly part of my past now

I'm almost 23 and the past six years of my life have been spent in a blurry haze. It's ironic, before my sister offered me my first bowl I was ""never going to do drugs.""  Amazing how someone can dramatically change. Within the first year I slowly ramped up my weed usage. I started off taking a small toke every so often. It changed the way I perceived the world. Music became engrossing. I would put on my headphones and get swept away in epic soundscapes the vibrations sending waves of euphoria down throughout my body. Weed was fun, a new experience. 
I wasn't exactly fitting in with all the kids at school. All my friends at the time were jocks who only seemed interested in sports and basketball, something I never cared for or was any good at. Drugs were so taboo and I reveled I the rebellion. High school came, I had changed. I was no longer the quick witted intelligent jokester. I had become quiet and withdrawn. My friends abandoned me and I was left to fend off the world by myself. 
Bring on the crippling depression. Weed became my escape from reality. I was alone and weed had become my only friend. Always there, ever forgiving. Weed had become my crutch. Before school, during school, after school. I started doodling pot leaves, I began frequenting marijuana forums. I found a few friends (all of whom smoked, none of whom I would spend a great deal of time with.) I didn't need friends. I had withdrawn into my own world. The depression got deeper and darker, but never once would i consider putting down the pipe or stop smoking for any extended period of time. Fuck weed was my only comfort.
Bring on college. Still a stoner, my lack of socialization has crippled my social skills. My memory is shot. Unhealthy, thin, and pale. Depression, insomnia, social anxiety. All I wanted was to be happy, to find a girlfriend, to be comfortable in my own skin. My depression just kept building upon itself. I went to a psych doctor. This shrink pumped me full of drugs most notably adderall. The adderall launched me out of depression and into psychosis. It's tough to find a solid base for reality when you live your life alone in a drugged up dreamland. I was a decent student but the rigors of reality most notably on the social front deemed to much for me and I dropped out before I was to focus on a major.
Out of my cozy dark resenated apartment, back into my parents house. I'm going to change my life. I'm going to quit this life stealing plant and get back on track I tell myself.  I tell myself over and over again as I watch myself get pulled back under it's grasp again and again. Maybe I'll make it a week before the memories come flooding back, the realities of my situation come to fruitation. I know that I must quit this plant if I'm ever going to advance and improve myself. I continue to smoke when I know that I should not. I am addicted. With every bag that I have bought this week I have told myself that it will be my last. I then find myself picking up another later that very day. 
After writing all of this, the only thing that I want to do is go pick up another bag and get high. This shit is ruining my life. I'll never be the person that I want to be as long as I'm using. God I need help, I feel powerless to stop using something that stunts me.
 Anyways I'm going to give it another go. I need to know what it feels like to be sober again. Hopefully I won't trick myself into using again. I want to progress in my life but for me this addiction is tough to shake.

Looking back I realize that I started smoking because I was looking for an escape from anxiety and intrusive thoughts related to abuse I experienced as a child.  From the moment I took my first hit, I knew that weed was for me.  I walked home feeling as if I was riding on an escalator the entire time.  I got home, munched out and took the best nap ever.  I have been using daily ever since.  

Flash forward ten years to 23 years old.  That year I got busted with a small amount of weed in my car and plead guilty to a DWI in exchange for the DA dropping the pot charges.  I was on my way to law school and would not have been able to obtain Fed Financial Aid had I been convicted of a drug crime.  The DA felt bad and gave me a ""break"".  Now for most people this would be the moment where they realize that getting stoned is not worth jeopardizing their future.  But not me.  I stayed clean for 3 months and then went right back at it.  

I smoked all through law school (I'm two weeks from graduation) and by all accounts, I have done well for myself.  So why should I quit?  Unfortunately I'm compelled to quit for a killer job opportunity.  Should it matter why I'm quitting?  I don't think so.  The point is that I HAVE to quit and I realize its going to be a shitty experience.  I smoke weed when I'm celebrating, wallowing in pity, relaxing, or for whatever fucking reason I feel fit.  It will be tough experiencing life ""not-high"".  I've tried it and it's fucking boring.  But I guess that feeling will fade with time.  I write this as a form of accountability.  In hopes that somehow reducing my will to text will increase my chances of ""success"".  For the sake of my future, I ask for your support.  Quitting weed shouldn't be this hard...but it is.  FML.

I felt the need to post again today, and then decided if I'm going to be THIS open on reddit, I needed to create a username that's not so tied to my real identity. So what follows is today's post, and I'll tack yesterday's on at the end just so you'll remember it's me if you remember me. Sorry for any confusion!

 Something's been on my mind quite a bit today, and that's that I really don't have any, for lack of a better term, reward system for myself outside getting high. I've worked 8 days in a row, and it's really hitting me how strange it feels to not tell myself ""you really plugged through that, now you've earned a few bowls!"" Ordinarily after doing something unpleasant getting high's the reward, or it's how I ""prepare"" myself to do the unpleasant thing to begin with. Almost everything I use to reward myself or relax I've associated with being high. Get high and write. Get high and play video games. Get high and embroider. Get high and go camping. I think it's going to be quite a process to disentangle leisure activities from being high, but I can see how it's possible. But what about simple ordinary self-care? What do y'all do to reward yourselves? I'm thinking a long bath and a good book for tonight, but I think a big part of this for me is going to be discovering multiple sources of self-care, and any ideas would be welcome. I'm feeling sort of silly and ashamed typing this, I mean, I'm 30 years old and I don't know how to tell myself I've done well or I can relax now, but weed's been the way I've done that since high school.

yesterday's post:

Just wanted to talk to some people going through the same experience as I am. I'm a 14-year smoker, probably about 9-10 years of it daily/constantly. Last night my girlfriend very tentatively asked if I'd quit. I told her I would, but was anxious about it. She backpedaled a bit after that, I imagine because she didn't want me to feel resentful or ""make"" me quit. I told her that I've known for a long time it's pretty problematic and escapist, and one of the ways I've always rationalized it to myself is that nobody's ever told me it's a problem, and if someone I cared about ever asked me to quit, I would. I acknowledged that I was feeling pretty terrified, but told her that wasn't a reason I SHOULDN'T do it, but another indicator that I've got a pretty unhealthy relationship with it. So I'm resolved to do this, but my emotions are all over the place. It's almost funny, too, because I've actually been a few months without, at first because I was job hunting, and then because my longtime dealer stole 120 bucks from me, so I was looking for someone else. I was doing just fine without it thinking it would be back eventually, but the idea of not having it again is so frightening. I know I've self medicated my anxiety/PTSD with it, but to be honest my anxiety has been pretty managable the past couple of months. I've told myself I need it to deal with people, but I was so surprised to hear recordings of myself selling hotel rooms and I sounded pleasant and confident, completely unlike my internal image of myself. I've told myself it makes me more creative, but I've recently joined an artists's group and am creating. Even though I can sort of see through all the reasons I've told myself I Need It, I still feel on an emotional level that I do. I feel like I'm losing a support system, a dear friend. I know this is something I need to do, for my relationship and myself, but it seems like such a long road.

I remember Last time i partaked was wednesday night. 

I live in a house with a few other people. Some smoke, others don't, we all don't really mind it. I'm on day 4 since I last smoked and it's been getting hard. Last night after coming back from downtown my roomate lit up while we were all watching tv. I had a few drinks so my scumbag brain kept making almost want to take a hit. When my roomates all went to their rooms to pass out, I was still up for a little (cause I didn't smoke I think I wasn't tired). 

So here's what happened. I was cleaning up the mess before I was going sleep and I had the bowl my roomate just smoked in my hand (EDIT: CLARIFICATION,I didn't want a bowl with bud out in the open in case something happened. It was a stupid move on my part to pick it up. Next time, i'm gonna just cover it) when I noticed he only finished half of it. Now, we all used to share bud and stuff and support each other so I know he wasn't gonna give a crap about that last hit or two he left when he woke up, he probably would even forget about it even happening. The thing was, I had it, in my hand and I almost lit it up. My brain kept trying to think of excuses one after another. After 20 or so minutes of dilberation, I scooped the bowl out into the sink without hitting it, washing what was left down the drain. It was a tough moment but I'm so happy I was able to do that and not take the hit.

Today is my 11th day without hitting the green and I am just now starting to feel better. I haven't smoked as long as some of you guys (every day for 3 years smoker), but I was starting to think that it was time for a change. My reasons for quitting:

1. All I have done over the past few years other than going to work and school was watch netflix and play video games. Before I started smoking every day, I wrote music non-stop and read numerous books (I would generally be on multiple books at one time). Since I started smoking regularly I haven't written one song nor have I finished a single freaking book.

2. I'll be graduating soon and although I don't anticipate having to be drug tested for a job, I wouldn't have been able to piss clean in the past three to four years. That bothers me.

3. If I was ever sober, I was in a haze. I hated that feeling, so I would smoke, wait for it to start coming back, then smoke some more to keep it repressed.

4. I became boring as fuck. IMO I have a substantial vocabulary and I was not utilizing any of it when I was stoned. My ability to ""think on the fly"" was completely shot and, unless I planned it out beforehand, any conversation I had would boil down to me just agreeing and saying ""Yeah"" a lot without ever slipping in my own input.

Over the last 11 days I have felt incredible and terrible all at the same time. This feeling is difficult to describe unless you have quit weed, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. before. I quit cigarettes about a year ago (a year in march!!!) and I can tell you that it was one of the most difficult things I have ever done. What helped me get over those first few shitty weeks was that a friend that had recently quit gave me some advice: The first few weeks are going to be shitty. It is going to suck really bad, but you know what? Let it suck. Enjoy how terrible it makes you feel because at some point in time you will get over the shittiness and you will need that memory to keep you on track.

These past 11 days have been weird. Up until yesterday, I felt hazy and I am just starting to come out of it. I can tell I am doing the right thing because all of my friends smoke and they are encouraging me to stick with it. Each one of them has secretly confided in me that they hope to give it up, but that they just can't for various reasons. This task is difficult. I'd say that it will probably be more difficult than quitting cigarettes was for me, but I am going to do it.

tl;dr **The first few weeks are going to be shitty. It is going to suck really bad, but you know what? Let it suck. Enjoy how terrible it makes you feel because at some point in time you will get over the shittiness and you will need that memory to keep you on track.**",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_18z12e,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/18z12e/i_am_now_11_days_sober_heres_what_i_have_gathered/,

I was recently diagnosed with depression and anxiety and have decided that quitting marijuana is in my best interest. I look forward to the return of revitalizing REM sleep, a clearer sense of focus and direction, and spending more time living life instead of stoned on the couch. I imagine my reasons for quitting are much like everyone else's.


I smoked the last of my tree on the weekend, and I am on my third day of sobriety (the new SSRI notwithstanding).


I didn't sleep a wink the first night after abstaining; sweating bullets and tossing and turning until sunrise; but fatigue has thankfully since returned. I had a truly restful sleep last night, if lacking in length.


My problem is that now I am at home and craving pot. I would just love to vape a bowl, curl up with tea and a blanket on the couch, and catch up on How I Met Your Mother watching the snow fall.


The physical symptoms I can deal with. I've gone through the insomnia, the voluminous sweat, and the dreams straight out of Fear and Loathing before. I have the willpower to abstain through the physical withdrawal, but I'm not sure beyond that. However, as you might have been able to surmise, I didn't manage to stay off the sticky icky before.


How long will I crave the high? Is this an indefinite commitment to constant vigilance because of the leafy green devil on my shoulder, or will I soon be able to 'forget' about pot?

To which I replied, ""of course I can, I'll stop for one month starting today."" I figured it would be good to save some money and I needed a tolerance break anyways.

I quit entirely, and I've been clean for a solid 2 and a half months. However, since then I've used LSD six times, and I feel inclined to do it more. I also drink more heavily then I did beforehand.

In total, I've done acid something like twelve times, and it's starting to get old. Drinking is dead to me, I have a bad time almost every time but I do it anyway, mainly because I'm bored, or around my friends who are also drinking. This is mainly a rant to get all my feelings out on the table, but I feel like I'm headed in a worse direction after stopping smoking, and I'm not sure if I should ever do drugs again, since I'm so worried about it.

I took a good look at myself and realized that if I'm going to be able to build on the moderate success I've already accomplished, I'm going to have to change with myself. I'm going to have to break out of the pattern of smoking that once defined my days and nights. I'm gonna hafta not-smoke, or else give-in to the stagnation instead of building a new tower of awesome on top of that plateau I've reached. I **can't** be mediocre! I just CAN'T be. No! Not I! I'm too awesome for that!

I went to bed an hour early last night, because I just didn't want to be awake any more. I felt emotional, drained, under-stimulated. Then I woke up 2 hours early this morning, 4:30 am, though I didn't get out of bed until regular time. I figure these things are caused by the change of routine and smoke-habit. Cool, changes accepted. 

Guess what? I've signed myself up for some free online courses through Coursera.org! I'm super-excited about it. This morning I started participating in a course on informal logic offered by Duke university and though I'm not exactly a super-genius, it feels really good to be challenged like this. I've got myself signed up for a bunch of courses, one beginning as soon as the previous one is ending, for from now on until June of next year! I've spent the morning so far listening to lectures while I paint, stopping to do the exercises and take the quizzes. This is how I'm going to spend my days off from now on, and I feel really frickin good about that. 

Oh my gosh you guyz, I'm going to be so improved by the time I'm 26.

Right now I'm 29 y/o, smoked daily from 15-23.  I never wanted to stop but developed a serious mental illness due to use (did some other stuff too, here and there) and eventually, years later after hitting bottom time and time again, did stop.  Since then I finished my B.S., started a career, moved on.  
I really lost a big part of my life due to the lifestyle/addiction; due to the mental illness I really can't piece together what happened for a long period of time.  I did time in jail for failing a drug test for the courts over a paraphenalia charge.  I was admitted to mental hospital numerous times over psychotic breaks, which also caused a couple more misdemeanor charges later.  
9 out of 10 of those ""friends"" I had are completely meaningless in the long run.  The amount of money spent is laughable.
I had a brief relapse in 2008, which brought about a brief psychotic episode.  It was completely necessary in my recovery, because I know I'll never be able to smoke ""like a normal person"".  I'm sure I'm in a small minority of people here for their reason to quit, but I'll tell you same thing you've probably heard before... there's a lot of stuff out there to entertain you, way too much, you have to pick and choose.  Pot isn't necessary to have a good time.  When you do quit remember you have an addictive personality, don't just substitute alcohol, gambling, food, or abundance of sex.  Running, weight-lifting, yoga, etc. are good.

It's been interesting to go through the process of sobering up. You see things in a different light.

This morning I was driven home early by an adult leader. Last night, one of the adults smelled weed after a friend and I snuck away from the group to smoke before bed. I guess they isolated me as the source of the odor before anyone else, and so I was the only one who got busted. Two of the the adults confronted me this morning after breakfast, and I came clean without hesitation. I knew there was no denying my guilt, I mean obviously they already knew. I wasn't about to rat out my buddy either. I owned my actions, which I knew was the right thing to do.

Before they confronted me about that though, they discussed with me how, as the eldest of the youth, I am looked up to by pretty much everyone else as a role model. I came to this group under a year ago, during my senior year, and already I've established such a secure and trusted bond with nearly every other kid. I will be graduating high school as soon as I finish my second senior year within the month. After that I will be allowed to attend youth group sessions only until the end of the semester. When I shared this last bit with the group last night (before I got high) there were reactions of devastation from other group members. I'm including this part of the story to help illustrate how much I mean to the rest of my group, and therefore how important it was that I set a good example.

Before I was taken home by the adult leader, I had to explain to the others why I was leaving the camping trip early. I told them I broke a rule, and the trust of the adult leaders in doing so. I explained it was my responsibility to own my actions. I asked them for their forgiveness, and I reassured them I would attend sessions in the future. I did not tell them what I did that got me kicked out of camp.

I got home and torched a bowl. Almost immediately I was plagued with feelings of shame and remorse. To see the looks on their faces when I told them I did something wrong, wrong enough to get me ""suspended"". I feel like I let them down. I feel guilty for betraying the trust of the adult leaders. Then I realized I also let myself down. I've let my habit interrupt the safe comfort and sanctity of my youth group, a place I went to get high on life. Not only that, but for YEARS I've been making excuses for everything to the people in my life and to myself. I'll twist my mind until I've justified my mistakes with weak, sorry excuses just to avoid facing the fact that I fucked up. I'm sick of living this way. It's time to get over myself.

Tonight I'm giving away my stash and tomorrow I'm giving away all my paraphernalia. I'm gonna lay off for a while. Since 10th grade I've used weed as a crutch. I've blown all my earnings since then on drugs. I've dropped out of high school and gotten lucky enough to have another shot at graduating.

My one roommate is a old friend that goes pretty far back and we used to smoke alot of pot together.  This friend of mine recently became unemployed and started dating this girl, so he gets on this big kick about how he is going to stop smoking so he can pass a piss test and get a ""legit"" career going and just basically grow up a little.  He talks a pretty big game about it saying he's getting rid of all his weed and some of his pieces.  He leaves to go see his family for a week so he can quit cold turkey easier.  I kid you not 15 minutes after I brought him back from the airport he started smoking with my other roommate and tonight when he got home he said he was going to get his medical card.
  And you know how can I judge him?  I have been in that exact position so many times in my life.  But I still have judgement deep down in my heart and maybe jealousy too.  Jealousy that I cant relax my vigilance for a second because I really need to not do this and I've already invested so much in it.  And its not the temptation that gets me, because I think that I'm at a pretty good place in my life right now where I actually dont feel tempted by it very much.  I think that I am just really lonely in being sober.  And disappointed that he rolled over so easily.  He really tries to rationalize it too, saying that he's ""going to be really moderate about it"" and ""I was really productive today and I still got high.""  That all sounds hauntingly familiar to me, like an old tape recording of me saying the exact same things.  I'm not going to tell him these things because I told him that I'm going to support him no matter what and I mean that.  Live and let live is the way I usually operate.  And I also have to respect the fact that pot does different things to different people.  I'm writing about this because as you can see I'm filled to the brim with conflicting views and emotions.  Anyone had (having) similar experiences with loved ones who smoke?  Thanks for listening.

I can't even recall how i stumbled upon leaves, but it’s been like staring into a still pool. I recognize myself so much in everyone's story, the same self sabotage, the same irrational fears and insecurities, the same isolation and loneliness. It took sitting at work all day and building up the gumption to finally act, but today marks day 1. I came home tonight and gathered all my glass, and gear, and gadgets; some of the best friends I've had in the past few years.  Tucked them away safely out of site and sat down to make this final. 

   
   I would guess that it’s been 6 years, 4 of which were almost every day. Longest break probably didn't exceed 30 days, just enough to pass a employment screening (although there were a few I didn't).  Weed has slowly become the best friend I’ve got, no, more than that. She’s the comforting arm when I come home. She puts me to bed, and often wakes me up. Not 3 months ago, I was sure I would smoke until the day I died, I was resigned to it, I had convinced myself that I was so broken and the only way to survive was to stay numb, to hide, to shield myself. I was content with that.
 

   Shortly after this realization, I got in some trouble while on vacation in NC,  possession of course.  Luckily NC is decriminalized and I ended up getting a slap on the wrist for the cost of a good lawyer. While waiting for my court date back home in Florida, I told myself it was time for a break “I don’t know what kind of trouble I’m in, i should stay clean until I’m out of the woods.” “I just lost all that money to a lawyer, it would be irresponsible to buy more weed!” I had so many good reasons. Over the last few months, I’ve taken about 3 breaks, each last between 6-13 days, which always ended in me throwing caution to the wind and picking up where I left off. Finally I got the good news that I had dodge any real legal trouble, and I promptly picked up. Instead of being happy about smoking weed again, I felt…. Defeated. I wasn’t able to stop for even a month! I slowly started realizing how much of my life was defined by pot. The company I kept, the hobbies I chose, I was a pot head through and through, and proud!
   
   
   I just moved into a new place with a roommate after living at my dad’s house since high school, (I’m 24). Living with someone else makes it a lot harder to isolate, I found myself out of my element. This culminated one weekend where I sat and watched basic cable and smoked my bong for 3 days straight, feeling like a corpse the whole time, just dead. I realized that this was what I did back at home, but with my roommate around as a point of contrast, I was so ashamed. He is so active, and social, and well adjusted. Plays in a band, talks to girls, takes risks, and goes on adventures. I felt like I was crippled next to him, and I was, I am, I have been. Weed has  been a short leash, an excuse to avoid anything that made me uncomfortable. Around this time, I found R/nofap, I watched the entire “Your brain on porn” series in one sitting, and realized that if fappin was fucking up my head this much, what was weed doing? From there it’s been a gradual progression, researching, reading, finding this community, and above all understanding that this is an issue for many people. Maybe I’m not quite as broken as I thought; maybe I’m just addicted to my highs.

   
   I see now that since I can remember, I’ve been a pleasure seeker, never finding happiness. Getting fixes off drugs and drink and quick fucks; over consumption of just about anything I enjoyed. How shallow I’ve been, sucking my environment dry to get my kicks. I want more, I’ve always wanted more, but I’ve been paralyzed. So I’m taking a step, I don’t know if it’s the right one, and I’m scared shitless.  But action is never easy, and it’s time for a change, any kind. I want to get to know myself when I’m not chasing a high. For better or worse.

   
   So I’m sitting here heartbroken for giving it up, trying to understand that pain is just an indication of how little control I’ve had. I’ve slowly been making progress in taking a break from drinking; I think it’s been a week. I also started to get some running in around my complex. These little things have helped affirm that there is hope there, it is small, and there are many obstacles, but I have to reach for something or my life is going to pass me by. 

   
   I wrote out some goals today, I realized that 6 weeks seems to be the appropriate time frame for detox, that’s 42 days, the irony was not lost on me. My goal then is September 1st. I don’t know what will happen after, but I know I have to get there; I have to prove to myself that I can preserver. Prove to myself for once in my life that I can achieve a goal, that I’m not doomed to cowardly dodging my life. I want control. It is time!


**TL;DR** I’ve been tokin my way through life but now I’m ready to see what I can make of myself.

(Day 5),fatmiles,19,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/vghwy/the_first_few_days_are_easy_dont_let_that_fool/,"I actually stopped smoking weed for five months last year. That's the longest I've abstained, EVER, since I was 15 years old. Then I started smoking occasionally, thinking I had mastered self-discipline. It was a short, surreal, slippery slope back to my ""all day every day"" habit. I still don't quite know how or why I let myself go, but I did.

I've tried quitting several times in the last few months, for the usual reasons. I made it three weeks at first, felt great, and smoked to reward myself. Bad idea. The fog instantly came back over me, and I fell back into my old ways. Smoking all day. Every day.

Last week, I made it five days, had a productive week, and couldn't see the harm in smoking a blunt with my friend and seeing Prometheus. I spend $80 on weed the following three days, smoking myself into oblivion.

Now I'm five days in once again. These last five days haven't been that difficult, to be honest. I've felt good, more alert, and have certainly been productive. I've thought about weed, but it hasn't been an overwhelming urge. Just a thought. 

But now it's friday, and it just crossed my mind that it wouldn't hurt to smoke a bowl or two this weekend to reward myself for a productive week.

But I know better this time. THC is still in my mind, clouding my judgement. It makes me think ""it's no big deal"" to smoke. It's a tricky devil.

Just as a word of advice to everyone on here... PLEASE be careful. You WILL think at some point that it will be no big deal to smoke. It always seems realistic, in theory, to smoke JUST THIS ONCE and then go back to sobriety. But we all know it's not that simple. You'll get sucked back in, just like I have way too many times. 

I've learned, through my multiple attempts (and one semi-success) at sobriety, that I just can't even fuck with it. AT ALL. It's too bad. I wish I could smoke on occasion. I wish I could light up once a month or so. But I can't. It will just bring me back into the same fog and before I know it three months have passed and I've smoked blunt after blunt and run out of paper clips from all the resin I've scraped and my life is in shambles and I'm filled with regret.

Five days in. My brain knows something is wrong. There isn't enough THC in my system. And I'm starting to get ancy. I REALLY want to smoke now. It's hard to concentrate. But I will persevere. I have to, for my own sake.

And remember, if you're trying to quit, you're doing it FOR A REASON. You've probably hit rock bottom in some capacity, which is why you're trying to pull yourself out. This alone is enough to provide you with a gung-ho attitude for a while, that makes quitting not seem all that hard. Just remember that this is only the beginning of the race. You need to keep it up. Don't let your mind play tricks on you. Don't allow yourself to be convinced that weed isn't a big deal, or that you can smoke ""just this once"". It is OBVIOUSLY a big deal or you wouldn't have quit in the first place.

Ran out of 'proper bud' yesterday, and the fact that I have to do this to even possibly enjoy a few hours of sleep should make me feel like a fiend. But it doesn't. And I've come to think that is a problem.

I've been VERY regular for a little over 6 years now. Over that stretch, perhaps the absolute longest dry spell I have had was MAYBE a week. Consumption peaks around a 1/2 per week.

 Have to have a bong rip or two before breakfast, might as well take another before that shower. Gotta go to class? Better get high. Gotta go to work? Better get high. Want to exercise? It'll be more fun high. Hey man these videogames aren't as enjoyable unless you go get high. About to eat dinner, need to burn some. Hey what better way to wash down that meal than with more bud? Such is my life, and I think I am finally fucking tired of it.

I didn't really intend to end up here, who does I guess. I got railroaded into stoner-dom at an accelerated rate at 18 when I found out both my parents were daily smokers, so were my brother and sister, so was my uncle and his family, and even most of the in laws. None of my sister, brothers, or uncles younger children have any idea this whole family gets high every day, some all day, most with other hard drugs thrown in the mix. Surrounded by all this, I came to think it was perfectly normal for an adult to be high as a kite, whenever, wherever. To an 18 year old, it felt like winning the family lottery in some ways. You're considered a light smoker if you are only putting away a 1/4 a week with this group.

Only with some more years under my belt did I start realizing how not normal all of this was, and that everybody and increasingly myself had a problem. I'd think ""what the hell were they doing taking a straight laced nerdy kid who played eq and wow all day and throwing all this weed in front of him"". I'd get mad that my brother took me around to different grow ops in town and tried to talk me into selling to my friends so I could get more free smoke (really taking care of me there bro). Remembering all the family gatherings of my childhood, now realizing everybody was slipping away to get high. I've been bitter about that for a while now. I've blamed the situation around me for making me what I am today, and that blame has rendered me helpless. I'm ready to own the fact that nobody tied me down and made me smoke a fuckton of weed all this time. I've made this bed.

I'm tired of the forgetfulness, tired of not being able to properly articulate my thoughts in a conversation, tired of being complacent all the damn time. Tired of thinking where I'd be if my chief concern over the last half decade wasn't getting lit. Plain-old tired of being high. I don't know if I could ever get tired of GETTING high, that first magical 15-20 minutes after you burn some good weed combined with choice music... I'm prepared for that to haunt my dreams forever. Everything that comes with and after that enlightened 15 minutes can go right to hell though.

I'm not even gonna think about the money spent. Too painful.


I sincerely think I could go without ever buying weed again. Of course, this is all being typed up at 4am after burning down a tar ball, so maybe I'm full of shit. I really wanna think I've lived out/outlived this lifestyle and can move on though. The thought of losing another year to the haze... Family gatherings are going to be hard, and I'm going to try and avoid all the non-essential ones. I hope I'm ready for this...

Of course, on the same day that I had an orientation for a temp agency so I could find more work, he pulled me aside and said he really appreciated and valued the effort I've been putting in, and that I've been a great help in ""straightening out some people"" (remember the racism thing, the guy who threatened me, plus I helped stop this girl from having a bunch of attitude at everyone) and offered me an additional job (to the tune of a mere extra 6 hours a week to add to my existing 12, but still) that I have been wanting. I kind of groaned at him: right after you told me to look for other work! But he told me that I had a week to decide whether I wanted the job or not, and that he'd hold onto it for me until then. I figured I wasn't going to be able to take it, but after the orientation at the temp agency---which seems kind of ghetto and the other 5 people who were there with me were approximately 10% as smart as I am, not to be rude or mean to them, but I am clearly severely overqualified for the kind of work they are staffing people for--I think I am now.

My stoner buddy, who I have been kind of down on in the last few days, has been trying to get me to come work for his company. When faced with starving to death working at my current job, or taking yet another job that is far below my qualifications, I realized that now that I'm not smoking pot I have no reason to act like an anti-social douche who doesn't want to work with his friend at his friend's company (who I am already programming for on the side anyway) and it seems like it may be a sure thing that I can go work with him, and still work at my current job since I like the people so much... I'll just have to have them adjust my schedule a bit. The idea of working from 4am to 5pm seems scary, since I've always been a lazy ass, but on the other hand maybe it'll be good for me...

I guess my buddy didn't understand what I've been going through. I told him today was the first day that I didn't really feel like I want to die for any part of it, and he acted surprised and asked me if that was really how I felt a lot without marijuana and I told him yes. I explained to him that when I used to say ""I have to smoke to stay sane,"" I wasn't just joking, that it was the truth. And that when I would panic when I would run out of marijuana, it wasn't just me exaggerating a minor annoyance, I would actually be panicking. I guess I just never told him how severe my emotional problems really are. He said he had no idea, and he can't imagine feeling that way. In truth, it's weird for me to think that most people *don't* feel like crawling into a dark corner and dying on a daily basis. It's always been a part of my life experience, the wishing it would all just fucking end, you know? I can write about it so casually because it's always been there like a warm blanket to wrap myself in. (I think I'm aping DFW a bit there.)

The woman I mentioned in other posts, who I can't possibly get in a relationship with, seems like she likes me and wants to spend time with me prior to her moving away. We sort of laid our cards out on the table today, and we seem to be on the same page: we don't want to get totally serious, but we enjoy each other's company and might as well enjoy each other until we can't anymore. I'm kind of thrilled. I just like to be around her, and I'm not in any danger of falling madly in love with her and going crazy when she eventually leaves whenever that may be. Sure, I feel kind of like I would totally marry her and put babies in her, but I know that's not an option---she is such an independent spirit and that is part of what makes her so alluring. Anyway.

In the end... I've been happy all day. I haven't let my parents get me down. The idea of working full time at a nice job again is the light at the end of the tunnel: I'll be able to move out, it won't matter if I'm kind of poor. The idea of spending time with a smart, beautiful woman who challenges me and keeps me on my toes is thrilling, even if it's only temporary---temporary is probably what I need right now.

It's kind of... amazing. Today has been amazing. Oh! And I learned another song on my ukulele, just need to get the words down.

1323315293.0,19,self.leaves,n4bgx,GOD DAMMIT! I've been trying to post this to you guys all day. ,,21,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/n4bgx/god_dammit_ive_been_trying_to_post_this_to_you/,"I'm out. At least until Jan 10. I just need a fucking break. Yesterday i smoked all i had left and now we play the waiting game. Weed became an everyday occurance. It was really getting in the way of my life. I was even wake-n-bakin before i went to school or my job. The time has come to stop. 


edit: After feeling the support and finally actually reading other peoples stories I decided to open up a bit and get real as well. I really love this sub-reddit. 

I have always gotten by pretty decently with weed, good grades and such, but I always felt like I was being held back. I never felt like I really reached my true potential and that weed was the cause. But I couldn't help smoking because like I said, I was doing alright.

It took a close brush up with the law to really help me understand that weed is still ILLEGAL. I was on my roof, like I have been a thousand times before, smoking a spliff with my roommate and enjoying a fucking a great sunset over the George Washington bridge. 

When we went back downstairs to our apartment, we were met by two cops who immediately accused us of smoking weed on the roof and demanded to see our identification. My roommate was too stoned and scared to talk, so I said ""we were not on the roof and we live here. What can we help you with?"" I realized that I was able to talk to the police completely normally because I always use to get high before important shit like a complete dumb ass. 

They tried to play good cop bad cop to get me to admit that I was stoned at the time but I saw right through it. Sorry, but no cop, while on duty, is my friend. Also, I pulled out my iphone, turned on the video camera and put it back in my pocket. Just trying to protect myself :)

Soon after, a third cop came downstairs from the roof (I assume he went directly to the top floor by elevator and somehow, just missed seeing my roommate and I). He said that we were the suspects and that a police officer FROM STREET LEVEL (this is a 6 story building) positively identified us by the color of our shirts! I said ""sorry officer we were not on the roof."" Frustrated they said they were going to write us up trespassing anyways. I repeated to him that we were not on the roof. They didn't care, they were going to write us up. 

My roommate did not have his ID on him. The cop told my roommate to go into the apartment and get his ID. When my roommate went in one of them tried to gain access (walk in) into my apartment. I immediately asked him what he was doing and why he felt the need or had the right to enter my apartment. To my surprise he apologized but then he gave a BS excuse that he was concerned that my roommate was getting a weapon. I asked him if he was serious and if we looked or acted hostile in anyway. He said no and shut the door. 

Then we got our court summons but they fucked up. They wrote that we had to appear in court by 2/1/11 and not 2/1/12. I can't go back in time?! So hopefully we'll get the whole thing thrown out. If it does go to court I will plead guilty to trespassing but will argue that the roof door has no posted signs that say we are not allowed to go on the roof. Also, I will say that I repeatedly said no to the officers about smoking weed on the roof and misunderstood them if they were asking about only being on the roof. Is this a good strategy? 

The point is that it was too close. If I didn't immediately deny everything they would have asked to search me and I would have been fucked. If I didn't speak up right away about the officer entering my apartment I would have been fucked (shit was on the table). Thank god all i got was a summons for trespassing that they fucked up on.

I can't contribute anything really useful, because pot has never been a part of my life, but I'm glad I've read all these posts because it's given me a broader view of reality than I normally get.

(Remember that all of this is from the perspective of a non-smoking outsider, so take it with a huge grain of whatever.) All my life, I've had friends who were regular smokers. Some of them were good students, good co-workers, solid friends. Some of them were complete and total flakes, who could not be counted on for anything, either in work, in school, or in friendship. Most were somewhere in between, or more specifically, had good periods or bad periods. For a couple of them, smoking was in fact a gateway which led them to really self-destructive things. For a couple others, it was something they went through and abandoned, preferring a pot-free life after trying it for a while. 

I have noticed something, however, about my friends who are ex-smokers which differentiates them from both my smoker and never-a-smoker friends: the ex-smokers (who stopped because they wanted to, not because they got caught and can't wait to start up again) are very much more other-oriented and generous with their time and attention than they were before. My voluntary ex-smoker friends used to spend a lot of their energy on stuff that ultimately concerned only themselves. Now they seem to be unsatisfied with only pleasing themselves and instead are noticeably more directed towards their relationships and friendships.

Again, as an outsider, I have no idea whether this is a real phenomenon or just my limited and self-selected perception. I also have not the faintest clue whether 

1) there's a cause-and-effect in either direction

2) it's just a limited, biased, and irrelevant correlation (i.e. the plural of anecdote is anecdotes, NOT data)

3) there's something larger going on for which both of these characteristics (ex-smoker and more other-oriented) are both side-effects",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_l0hqv,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/l0hqv/from_an_outsider/,

Normally this would call for me to get wicked baked, but I have refrained. I took the money and completely paid off my credit card bill.

I would be lying if I said I didn't still have urges to smoke (being stuck in traffic on the way home makes me want to light up a joint like no other), but it is far more manageable. Part of it may be that I am taking my Klonopin more often (as recommended by my psychiatrist, I am taking .5mil two or three times a week to get better rest). Originally we tried upping my seroquel but that did nothing to help my sleep and made me an unstoppable eating machine. The Klonopin keeps me calmer and allows me to sleep through the night.

I am seeing a drug counselor who claims that it takes about 10-12 weeks to break the addiction cycle, so I plan to stay clean for at least 84 days. Hopefully by then I will be able to close my current account, move out and then make my own choices. But for now, I am 45 days clean from weed, completely out of credit card debt and no one can take that away from me.

I'm not doing NA/MA/AA because I personally don't agree with some of their methods, but I see a counselor and a drug counselor.

About 6 months ago, I decided to leave my job (long story; doesn't matter). I also decided to quit smoking because I wanted to clean up for any drug tests I might face in my job search. In reality, I had other reasons to quit, but this was the most pressing, and I chose my career over my smoking habit for the first time in a decade.

All this time, I had this nice external motivator to stay clean, the threat of a drug test. Job searching is stressful enough that I didn't want to worry about passing a test on top of everything else I had my mind on. (Coincidentally, for the same reason, I got myself a new computer. A Mac. I didn't want an unreliable computer to fret about when I'm trying to get in the zone of looking for work.)

I am happy to report that I have accepted a job offer! I am excited! It is in my field, it's for a recognized and respected company, and I got a big raise from my last position. 

There is no initial drug test. And I'll have to find out somehow without being weird about it, but I don't think they do random testing either. They do have a policy that people not be intoxicated during work hours.

So, my external motivator is gone.

I think I am entering a new phase of all this. If I am not going to get tested from work, what will stop me from smoking? I used to be a wake-and-baker and shamefully smoked before work. I cannot go back to that. I don't want to. I am sure I was doing it because I was unhappy at my last job.

Without that threat over my head, I am worried for myself. Like others have posted here, it's going to be so tempting to think I can do it occasionally.

I do have other reasons to quit. I am 35 and been smoking for 15 years. I don't really want to be a stoner for the rest of my life. I've had plenty of high experiences. Smoking more won't show me anything new about life at this point. I don't like worrying that my neighbors will smell it, or hiding from my family. I have an infant nephew now, and I don't want to worry about whether I'm straight enough to care for him. I live in the suburbs now, and I don't want to worry about whether I am straight enough to drive. I save money when I am not smoking.

Any thoughts?

The recap of the time I have been sober.
********************
It is roughly Day 38.  I have not smoked anything in this time.  It has been a roller coaster.  It took me about two weeks before I was feeling up to eating real meals again.  I avoided the problems caused by that by making sure I was taking a daily vitamin as well as a meal supplement in the morning and attempting to eat fruits/veggies throughout the day.  The being able to sleep came back within a couple of days of quitting.  To help that I started working out as hard as I could.  I am talking 1hr+ work outs in my room (Sit-ups, push-ups, shadow boxing, lifting whatever heavy shit I had lying around).  I have stopped working out for the most part.  I have lost interest in a lot of the things I used to like.  Video games are boring, skating is just a pain in the ass, I don't draw or do my stupid freestyle anymore.   I have been happy, and I have been sad.  My emotions are everywhere.  But hey if I can do it, I know everyone that is thinking about it can.  Believe in yourself.  Know that every time you say no you are stronger.  Be yourself, and if there is anyone of your 'friends' that don't like you cause you cleaned up.  Two words.  FUCK 'EM.  Drop those chumps.  If they are good friends they will understand you need your space and will be more than willing to get back together once you get your act sorted.    


********************

TLDR: Below is just a rant it doesn't have to be read.  This summarizes it quite well.  I am not happy after quitting for a month.  Quite the opposite, I am depressed, sad and tired of the place I live in. Thought I would have mental clarity, and I do, I just see all the ill will that this world brings forth.  

**************************************

It has been a little over a month since I quit.  After months of saying 'Oh I will quit, this is my last time' etc etc, I finally just stopped smoking.  I got tired of the coughing, I got tired of the failing grades, I got tired of it all.  Missing friends, bailing on family, spending money out the ass.  I got tired of using it as a crutch for my fucked up head.  I wanted peace, weed used to do that but no more, so I stopped just clean and clear.  And honestly the first week or so was GREAT.  I loved it being clean being in control of my self, learning how to take control of my mind and finally deal with the PTSD, the depression, all of it.  Now it has been a little over a month, it has been an incredibly long month.  I have had so much going on from school to social life to personal life.  I have quit cigs, I am trying to be healthy.  All that great stuff.

But I am not happy.  I am not happy at all.  This isn't a oh I am not happy today. I haven't been happy for fucking weeks.  I knew that quitting wouldn't end any of the shit I am dealing with.  I knew that.  But I thought it would at least provide me a mental clarity that would help me find happiness.  All I have found is how much I dislike this place I am living in, how inhuman we all are, how FUCKED UP this world is.  I hate it.  Sobriety has shown me that people are all just rotten.  Sure not everyone is, I got my friends and my family.  But still.  What the hell is wrong with this world.  We preach peace and love and understanding while holding a gun to every ones head.  'Follow the rules, it will keep you safe. Look out for your fellow brother/sister.'  only to be yelled at and threatened when you do exactly that.  I mean ffs, I tried to help this kid who was pickpocket only to have the dad want to beat my face in because he assumed I was the one who did it.  Please think about that.  I am going to pickpocket you and then walk up and tell you that I just did that, yeah makes PERFECT sense.  That hurt me a lot.  I know I am what some consider sketchy but damn...do I look that bad?  Do I act that fucked up!?

Makes me wish I never quit.  At least then I could live in ignorant bliss.  But I won't smoke again FUCK THAT NOISE. Sure I get cravings every now and then, who doesn't?  Its an old friend calling me back, giving me an option just to say FUCK IT, and block out all this shit.  I don't want it though, I really don't.  I want to face everything head on. 

But I honestly thought I would be happy.  Instead I am constantly putting on a fake smile, being happy for friends and family alike.  No one knows the nightmares I have.  And I am not saying that to be poetic.  How disturbing it all is. How tired I am because I am constantly battling my own mind when I am awake.  Trying desperately to stay grounded in reality and remember that I must live NOW in the present.  I thought being clean would help me.  I guess it has helped me gain an upper hand in that battle.  I am able to do what I need to do instead of just get high and say FTW.  I have tried talking to my friends but it is hard to have them understand this, I don't blame them at all for not understanding, I appreciate everything they do!  I really do.  It's a small moment of light knowing there are some out there willing to help.  I have tried talking to my school therapists but all they ever want to do is medicate me.  Give me sleeping meds and shit.  I hate meds, I already take them for ADD and I see the huge difference it makes in me. Why the fuck would I want meds that would keep me asleep or 'mellow' me out.  If I wanted that I would just go rip a god damn bong.  At least that works.  One person who helps though is my own personal therapist and that has cost me more money then I have.  I am constantly broke. 
It is like nothing has changed.
All the same crap, just a new fucking angle. 
Instead of being high and ignoring my friends, I am now stuck in the library attempting to pull my grades back up so I can graduate.
Instead of spending my money on weed it is spent on doctors and fucking school projects.
Instead of being blissfully unaware, I am completely aware and all I see is hate and ill will.
Instead of feeling like the bare minimum is good enough, I can never seem to do enough despite trying my hardest. 
Instead of blah blah blah fucking blah.  I constantly feel like I am bitching, just complaining and whining about NOTHING.  Dude, I say to myself, ""Look around you.  You got a computer, and a good school, and a car, and family, and friends.  Why are you complaining?""  Because none of it makes me fucking happy.  I say I want to go home, but I don't even have a home.  My own mom thinks I am kidding when I tell her I have PTSD, that it is just something that can just go away with time.  Fuck.  I am just bitching.  I am sorry Reddit.

I played basketball last night and was still wide awake at midnight from it. I play a lot and usually I would vape a couple bags and have no trouble sleeping but last night I was still up until 130 (after a chamomile tea) and then decided to take a OTC sleeping pill which put me out. Big mistake. Could hardly get up this morning and therefore missed my morning routine but I learned my lesson and now I'm good to go for Day 3. 

Last night a buddy of mine asked if I wanted to ""chill"" and I told him I couldn't because I'm on a hiatus right now and he respected it. It felt pretty great turning it down; like I've actually made a change. Up until then it was just me turning myself down and last night I was able to to turn it down from an external force.

1365358309.0,17,self.leaves,1bv3vb,ProTip- MAKE A LIST!!!,oguinn,20,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1bv3vb/protip_make_a_list/,"Sup guys. I'm currently on day 4 after smoking everyday for 2 years, and god damn do I feel like a new person. It is so worth it. Definitely one of my best decisions.

I went out to a party last night and was able to 100% let go and have fun! I barely had any mind consuming thoughts. I was social. And I brought a girl home for the first time in a while.

Its so worth it guys.

So far on day 4 my dreams are crazyyy, I'm still getting a lil hot and sweaty when I sleep but its less each night, my appetite is a little better, my focus is a lot better with my mind feeling less cloudy, my energy is slowly increasing everyday (most important to me), I'm loving the clear sober feel unlike day 1-2, and lastly I feel happier.

But back to the title, i found the best way to not smoke trees again was to MAKE A LIST! Make a list of the reasons you need to quit and order them by how important they are to you. Put this list somewhere you can see, preferably at your old rolling station just incase you crack. 

Making a list to me is the best way to remind myself AND if my brain starts trying to trick myself into smoking and somehow making me forget why I'm quitting, the list is there to remind me.

A few other tips that personally helped me are giving every pipe + paraphernalia away to your stoner buddies, but in order for them to have them they have to PROMISE not to ask you to smoke ever again.

Another one is stopping on a Thursday or Friday. To me the weekend is the best time to handle the withdrawals. You can go out and distract yourself. You don't have to sit at work and handle the withdrawals + think about how sweet being high would be. Personally, I bought a 12 pack of Oberon beer and drank one anytime I was looking for a fix (but if you have a drinking problem don't do this).
I also used half a melatonin pill each night to help ko myself.
One downside to the weekend strategy is you might be at a party with weed, but I would try to avoid those parties or let everyone know how important NOT smoking is to you.

The hardest day for me was day -1 and day 0 and truly committing. Once I honestly 10000% wanted to stop, it kinda was easy no offense. 

If you start thinking about weed smack yourself for Pavlov negative reinforcement, and then go look at your list.

If anything, you go buy a bag of weed after caving, at least wait 1 hour before smoking it and think it over.

You guys can ask me anything if you want! You won't regret quitting :) good luck

We as human beings have the ability to see; we can observe beautiful colors that are absolutely and truly beautiful without weed. We have ears to hear glorious music and a sense of touch to reach out and embrace those close to us. We have a heart that allows us to love others and ourselves, and we have a mind that gives us the ability to think and reason. Most importantly, with our capacity for self awareness, we have the ability to transcend the ego or 'self' and realize our true place in this world.

We can come to a place of understanding of the fact that we are interdependent with everything and everyone around us, that we are the universe and the universe is us, that we are as much a part of nature as the trees we see and the wind we feel, and that there is no reason to be afraid, to EVER be afraid. All those cliche sayings that we are made of stardust and that it is all 'one' however cliche they sound are TRUE. Those that are not ready to embrace those truths beat them down and label them as new age; they discredit them because they are afraid of what it would be like to drop all the illusory bullshit and realize truth. But I believe, truly believe through experience, that we are the stars and everything is one. If we put positive energy out into the world, if we love unconditionally and stay grateful, the universe will take care of us. That force is God, or Buddha, or whatever you want to call it, it's all the same thing.

Its not that weed is making my life bad, I just feel like its not making it much better. Also, I hope this doesn't violate the rules, but I do not see myself NEVER smoking again, and would like to at some point be able to smoke with friends or on my own, and have it still be a special and unique time, without weed being something that I need to have fun; is this possible, or recommended?

You can't handle it.  No amount of rationalization can change that.

You are uncomfortable because you smoked too much.

-Your Past Self.

Now.  Allow me to preface this series of events that lead to the re-confirmation of my addiction.  September 10, 2012 was my first day sober in a long while.  I had a deal with myself that I wasn't going to smoke until 4/20/2013.  I kept all of my paraphernalia and an ""emergency nug"" in my MFLB tin and wrapped it in electrical tape with a note inside stating that it was packed on 09/09/2012.  

Between day 6-11 of sobriety I was having massive amounts of depression, anxiety, and general mental unrest.  I was lashing out at my girlfriend for no good reason and having a hard time even living day to day being comfortable with myself.  The urge to smoke was growing along with the justification in my head that I should just have one puff to take the edge off and be able to be civil to my girlfriend.  It was that night on day 11 that I threw my tin in the dumpster and never looked back.  I acknowledged that it couldn't be a break.  It needed to be quitting or nothing.  The excitement of knowing that I 'could' smoke again was eating me and subliminally making me put myself in situations where I could get stressed out or make things bad enough for myself to justify smoking(God, I love addiction. Don't you?)  It was a struggle from a monetary standpoint to throw out an MFLB and even *gasp* weed but it was the smartest decision I felt that I had made in a while.  My mental and physical health were worth more than any sum of money and that was that.

Friday:  Four months and eight days sober and it brings us to Friday night.  It's my girlfriends birthday weekend.  She has been eating a Ketogenic diet and decided that Friday was a cheat day after losing 10 lbs.  We went down to Marble Slab and I treated us to an XL ice cream each.  As soon as we pulled into our parking stall at home she says ""It's too bad that...Never mind.""  

Me-""I know exactly what you were going to say.  Do you think that's a good idea?""

Her-""I don't know.  I've really been craving it lately. How do you feel about it?""

Me-""Well I can honestly say I haven't craved it in 2 and a half months.  I think that it would be fine this once.""

And the hunt began.  I drove up to my brother to meet him at a friends house 40 minutes away on the other side of the city just to buy a 5 bag.  I had a nagging at the back of my head telling me that I would regret it but I ignored it.  

I got home and asked her to prepare a bowl.  I had one hoot, waited 5 minutes, and I was comfortable.  At this point a normal person would leave it at one and proceed to enjoy the experience.  I am not a normal person.  I am addicted to marijuana.  I couldn't leave it at just one hoot.  This was my chance to get stoned and I was going to get as much THC into my system as possible.  We didn't even finish the bowl.  There was still a little bit of green left at the very bottom and I was uncomfortably high.

Saturday:  I woke up with a weed hangover.  The type you get where you can't wake up.  Your eyes are still dry.  You can't shake the fogginess in your head no matter how hard you try.  You have heartburn from eating a mountain of food the night before.  You all know what I'm talking about.  At this point I still had weed left(about 0.3)and I had this plan that I was going to bring it back to my brother but I didn't really have the motivation to leave the house for some reason.  As the day wore on my mind went from 'This needs to be gotten rid of. I'm never smoking again.' to 'This needs to be gotten rid of.  I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to smoke again.  I miss joints.  I should roll a joint.  I'll wait for the perfect moment to bring it up to my girlfriend.'

I brought it up that we should roll a joint and go for a walk so it's gone, she very reluctantly agreed.  I rolled a joint, we got halfway down the block and decided it was too cold.  We then smoked in our room and another night of boring ensued.  She left to get ready for bed at one point and that's when I wrote that note to myself after thinking about how pathetic this is.  I still have the roach and I'm having a hard time flushing it.  My mind keeps going to a place where I start planning for a time when I can smoke it alone and have no one find out.

I am, and always will be an addict.  I can't ever let myself forget that again.

Update: I just flushed the roach after my girlfriend came out and asked what happened to it.  I thought about just flushing the toilet and faking it but I didn't.  It's swimming with the poopies now.

Tl;dr:  Don't challenge your addiction and think that it's just a matter of time before you're cured.  It will always be there.  It's your choice whether you want to be a smoker.

Congratulations, you’ve made the decision to smoke pot. You are entering a new chapter of your life. You might feel excitement for rebelling from societal norms. You may feel accepted by a new group of people or reintroduced to an old one. You may have found a way to cope with your situation. You may not have anything to escape from, but you enjoy feeling different and experiencing life as you never have before. You might even think this is a phase that you must go through in order to grow up. You just want to have some fun. Your reason to start may not be here, but these resemble the things which I have seen in myself and in those close to me. We all had our first high, our first time ripped, our first time alone, our first joint, our first bong rip, our first vape hit. Some even went on to break the ice with large purchases, first sales, first robberies, even choosing dollars over friends and morals on a regular basis. I’m telling you all this because these things happened to me and I desperately don’t want them to happen to you.


Don’t get me wrong, I love smoking cannabis. I absolutely fucking love it. I know all the different smells and what they mean. I can name strains, identify effects, roll blunts and jays, pack and corner bowls, and get twisted. I think it should be legalized and regulated as it is certainly far less destructive than alcohol and cigarettes. It’s 1:39 AM and in my 15.5 waking hours today I have thought about getting high almost 50 times, yet I haven’t seen,  smelled, or used weed in over FOUR months. Each of my 124 days sober has involved some mental contact with this wonderful plant. Yet I don’t even remember the last time I smoked it. Before the end I smoked marijuana for a total of almost two years, with several months of all-day every-day, a short period of monthly use, and most recently use of the drug several times a week. Pot is expensive where I live compared to you lucky dogs in the South and West, and I lost almost everything I had trying to pay for nugs until I started getting it for free by dealing it. I tell you all this because it is a part of my story of escalation with pot and other drugs, a story which began in a basement on January 7, 2011.


I bent down on the floor over a bucket half-filled with water. I wasn’t heaving up my dinner, I was about to take my first hit of marijuana from a gravity bong. I did not know who I was or how I wanted to achieve my goals in life, but at the time I knew I wanted to explore the world fast and thoroughly.  A plastic bottle with the bottom cut off and a metal bowl melted into the cap made an adjustable sealed chamber over the water. When the substance was lit and the bottle slowly pulled out of the water, suction filled the expanding chamber with smoke. When lifted to the fringes of being sealed, the top was unscrewed and replaced by a mouth. The owner of the mouth simultaneously sucked in and pushed down on the bottle, forcing thick smoke deep into his lungs. That’s how my friends had done it. It was my turn, and as a newbie, it was important for me to be careful not to mess up and lose this valuable smoke.


I managed to clear the chamber and felt the smoke tickling at my lungs. It tasted surprisingly good in my mouth, and as I exhaled I began coughing violently, which didn’t feel all that bad, almost right. I had never smoked a cigarette or even taken a pull of alcohol in my life. I was a senior in high school, already admitted and committed to the college of my dreams, and I had decided that trying pot with some respectable and intelligent friends of mine would be a good idea to help avoid any surprises at school. Or something like that. There isn’t actually any one solid reason I would have given at the time for why I had the sudden change of heart to get intoxicated. Perhaps a deep underlying curiosity could be realized now that I knew that people I respected and admired smoked pot. They were responsible about it and it didn’t seem to outwardly affect their lives in any way at all. So I picked up this new hobby of smoking weed on the weekends. I got out of the house way more than I used to and somehow I was more connected to the world around me than ever before.
The morning of December 8, 2011 is very telling. I awoke still a bit hazy, but definitely giddy due to the previous night’s experiences. I heard music on a whole new level, acted young and unashamed with friends, and consumed food from a different universe. The problem was that I had never actually made a plan for my usage and experimentation. I had only thought as far as “smoke pot this Friday” instead of “why am I doing this and how and when can I achieve that goal?” I began to reconcile with this question on Saturday morning, setting up barriers to future use. I would only smoke with other people, I would never buy it, I wouldn’t tell my parents, I wouldn’t do it alone, and I would avoid driving after using it. School on Monday was absolutely filled with discussion about Friday’s events and how I felt about smoking weed. People I didn’t previously connect with began opening up to me about their experiences and I quickly began to think “everyone’s doing it.”
As I got more and more immersed into this thriving subculture, my barriers became more and more out of touch with my new reality. I wasn’t completely sober when I constructed these walls to keep me in the courtyard of moderation. They were quickly broken down or modified to accommodate the changing needs of my life. I came to understand that it was rude to mooch off others, and compensating them with cash often wasn’t enough. In order to take part, one needed to bring his own bag. I bought my first from one of those respectable, responsible, and smart gents who got me into it all. But even he showed signs of being out of control with his new dealing self. He even cautioned that dealing was a bad idea, a unique warning in a culture enchanted by the positive effects of pot.


I can’t stress enough that you need to be absolutely self-aware in order to make the decision to smoke weed. You need to make yourself as conscious as possible about the consequences and rewards of your actions, as this substance is powerful. It doesn’t kick you in the face afterward as much as alcohol does. This means the come down and ensuing hours are more likely to make you feel like you want another smoke in the future than the ‘never again’ mentality of the hangover. Weed still alters your reality and deep respect for it is the only way to thrive. Weed affects everyone differently, and what you see on the outside might not reflect the internal reservations and worries of a cannabis user. I must emphasize greatly the importance of a healthy dialogue with your fellow cannabis users for this reason. A higher consciousness can be reached more easily with the support of friends. If the group is a “hey just hit this” group rather than a “we agreed to a limit, let’s take a break” there is much higher potential for abuse. Use of cannabis can be a part of a thriving dynamic life, but abuse and silence can lead to intense and discomforting experiences surrounding marijuana. 


Speaking of thriving with weed, I absolutely wish I was capable of doing it. Like I said, I really like getting high. I dream of those evenings in that basement. I had fulfilled my responsibilities and spent the weekend with friends seeking new experiences. Recognize that pot affects everyone differently and I can’t tell you specifically how to use it to avoid abusing it. All I can say is that those days of low tolerance and moderate use are the best. I now feel as if I was chasing that first high in a way throughout the rest of my use of the drug. When my habits stopped yielding new results, I altered the method of my experimentation. One of the most profound of these alterations, later on in my use, was the multi-day binge. I would get high upon waking, and try to maintain that high throughout the day. This was markedly different than my parties-only weekend smokes from before. I was delighted at my perceived ability to continue to excel at things even while really stoned. I realized later that it actually made me worse at things I wasn’t good at. I’m not trying to scare you away from smoking pot. I’ll still recommend that people try it and use it, but I want people to go in with the tools to enjoy marijuana and not allow it to detract from their lives through abuse.


Dealing drugs was the absolute epitome of a drastic identity shift which was the result of my abuse of the ganja. With my amorphous self limits and rules, a budget was completely out of the question. And just like that, I ran out of money, but I did not want to stop smoking. It was college, after all. I started making firecrackers with my ABV. Business was working out, but people didn’t always want firecrackers and I didn’t always want to make them. I felt like I had to though, I might not be able to take this cash off their hands later on. With this inconsistency between what people wanted and what I wanted, I felt out of control. Instead of stopping everything and assessing where I had taken myself, I pressed ever onward. I started dealing mushrooms because I wasn’t interested in using them frequently. I had a connect and needed cash for bud, so it worked out real nice. I bought a ton of bud that way, but the ‘shrooms ran out and so did my control over my situation. I was tired of paying for weed, had lost sight of the guy who took that first hit in January 2011, and I wanted to keep experiencing new things.


I made a ton of money legally in the summer of 2012. I thought I should invest some of it and front someone, therefore keeping myself out of some of the risk and in the hunt for free bud. As it turned out, I was a better drug dealer than my front. I ended up fronting one ounce to him and keeping one to distribute on my own. I actually took pride in being a good drug dealer. I strove for customer service and honesty. But I also didn’t like shoddy competition or late payments from my front. I’d probably make an insanely good businessman. But I knew these were not things I wanted for myself. Then, on a run to pick up a half pound, I was robbed of every dollar I had coagulated. The gun flashed in the driver side window, with a long black knife not far away. Phones, cash, a tire, all gone. I was stranded, owed some money, and thought there was a good chance of an investigation. This was a smack in the face. I had messed up big time. By sheer luck I faced no negative legal or health consequences for my actions. My plea to you is to be very clear with yourself. Dealing drugs is absolutely and thoroughly bad. Sure, you are providing a service to others and are reducing the cost to partake in your hobby. But, there are immense hidden costs. Dealing takes over your life subtly and quickly branches out to grasp the fiber of your being. Try to wake up before you are awakened.


Legalize. Moderate. Use, don’t abuse. Pot really isn’t bad at all if you approach it in the right way. I just want you to see what the consequences of nearsighted goals and clouded judgment can be. I had the opportunity to make changes several times in my smoking career. Unfortunately, it took me a hell of an event to wake up. I’ll never be the same after that day. I don’t want that to happen to you. Go through your rebellious stage, sure that’s fine. Just don’t lose sight of who you were, who you are, and who you want to be. And tighten up that joint while you’re at it, no one likes a canoe. 

tl;dr: A lot of us should have quit before we even started. From chilling to billing, I went fast. Maybe you can see some of yourself in here, that's the best part of r/leaves for me.

She's been a daily smoker for about 3 or 4 years, I've been a daily smoker for 1 and a half years. I've taken extended breaks occasionally and have decided I can't handle the paranoia, the general depression, and the complacency that I've developed.

I used to be a straight A student and started grad school about the same time I started smoking. Became a heavy user when I was starting my thesis and can't find the motivation or the understanding to finish said thesis. 

New Years Eve we had our last smoke. This is also one step in my mind to saving our relationship. I found out last night that she's been smoking with our roommate pretty regularly. In reality she said only twice. But I know she's lying. She's told me that the only friends of hers that are successful in truly quitting had to change their people, places and things. I told her I wasn't mad and I expected it from her, which I find sad, but it felt like she lied to me. I've not been so disappointed. I feel like the support and this thing we would tackle together has been ripped away. I was depressed before about our relationship, and now I feel it's doomed. 

I didn't think I'd need this group as much as I do right now. I'm afraid of who this journey is going to take away from me. I don't think she realizes how serious I am when I say that when the lease is up I'm going to be changing my people and places drastically.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBPBcJlZlsA

It's really long, so I'll boil it down for y'all. One of the biggest points the guy made (an ex drug-addict) is that when you're addicted, resisting the urge to do or think about drugs uses a lot of brain power. So self-inhibition is taxing. And eventually it wears your brain down so that you do not have full cognitive functioning, and become more prone to give in to your addiction. But also, the inhibition wears down your mind so that your brain can't devote as much attention to other things either (like life in general). 

An example of this would be seeing a pipe, or someone referencing 420 in a conversation, or having a dream about smoking. Your mind starts thinking about those things and continues wanting to. Resisting that uses a lot of energy. Therefore, staying away from things that remind you of your addiction is very important. So leaving the house where you know your weed is watching you and joining a rock-climbing group will distract you which means it won't exhaust you and break down your resistance into smoking.

Personal example: Last night, my roommate (who smokes every day) and I were talking about weed/drugs. At the beginning of the conversation, if he would have asked me if I wanted to smoke, I would have said no. After we were done talking, he went in his room to smoke a bit. I asked him if I could take a hit. He said it was just resin so I said never mind. I'm happy I didn't smoke. But I realize that if anything marijuana-related dances around in my head, I'll be more likely to give in than if it was out of the blue offered to me.

This is a supportive community and I can't tell you how much a support group helps.  
  
I attended AA/NA meetings for a while at my local Masonic lodge and those people are a huge help. It's nothing like Half-Baked makes it out to be. They see weed as an addition just like everything else and it's not the substance that creates addiction but the individual. Marijuana is no exception. I was addicted and AA/NA helped immensely. Find a local group and go to a meeting.     
  
I have been clean for over a year now. I first quit because of legal issues and then found out that its much easier to stop using when I realized that the UA's were just an excuse and the real reasons I quit were far more important. A good way to stay off is to look at the reason you smoked in the first place. I used it to avoid my personal problems (lack of direction, school stress, women troubles) and to ignore the things I found disturbing in the world (war, politics, money). Drugs don't make the problem go away, they just make you not care. It seems like life gets harder when you quit but really its just as difficult as before, but you're dealing with your problems instead of putting them off/ignoring them.  
  
Marijuana is a waste of money and a de-motivator. Don't get me wrong, plenty of people can use it responsibly but there are just as many people out there that are addicted to it like I was.

This is crazy. I've been smoking for about 13 years in total. From 2008 to 2012, I completely forgot what it was like to be sober. I've tried to kick it a few times. Maybe once every few years. This year I've been much more consistent with trying to stop tho. I'd usually try to stop, fail, then forget about it for a couple years.

At first I tapered off, and I made it a month sober. I forget what exactly the reason was, but the basic jest of it was I thought I could control it. Since I tapered off, ending in a week between sessions, I figured I could buy some and be a casual smoker. Only every now and then with friends, for movies, blah blah blah. So I relapsed and that lasted for about 3 months. I was right back to waking and baking, and high all day from then on. 

Then I managed to stop again. This time it was much harder. I could not taper off. Had almost no self control it seemed. So I went cold turkey. No sleep, wasn't hungry, drenching nights, and a shitty mood for about a week. It was really pretty hard, all of my friends noticed that I wasn't myself. I'd say after about 3 weeks I was completely back to normal. I made it 6 months on that try. Probably the longest I've EVER made it in 13 years. 

I fucking slacked it again. Smoked to celebrate a really good poker night, and surely I came back. I smoked, then made it like A DAY, and was like just not everyday. Then I smoked with some friends 2 days in a row, just be moderate I said. Wake and baked, fuck it...the worlds gonna end. That was about 2 months ago...I've been trying to moderate throughout with little to no success. I come up with very convincing excuses to deviate. Best I could do was 2 hours. More if I was busy, but if I'm at home, I'm stoned.

And here we are. The world didn't end. The bowl is cashed, I'm broke and the jar is empty. This is the only way I can really quit it seems.

I've been smoking everyday for the past 4 years, primarily hits from a bong from morning until night. I always thought it was something I could just quit with a blink of an eye, well, four years later I'm STILL struggling. Its only gotten worse these past couple months. I recently lost my mom, which has been the toughest thing I think I'll ever experience. On top of that, I live alone, I barely have any friends, and I don't have any family to visit on holidays. This drug has now become my everything. It's become my friend, my family, my life. And it ends now. 
Every day is a struggle, a constant game of ""Oh - I'll start tomorrow and just have this last full day of smoking"". I'm so sick of it. Sometimes I'll skip paying bills get so I can afford to get my fix, then I'm overwhelmed with bills so I just smoke more which costs more money which causes more stress. It's a sick cycle. 
Today I'm vowing to make a change, but I'm asking for some help. I'm ready to stop. I've wanted to for so long, every time I smoke I think ""soon, soon.."" but it's not soon anymore, it's NOW!!!

I have been reading leaves every once in a while for some time and I've always admired everyone on here who is able to quit.  Before I went to college (22 now) I didn't smoke and I actually was anti-trees quite heavily which is hilarious now that I look back on it seeing what it has done for me.

I've have an amazing girlfriend of a year and I have a lot of big dreams about my life.  I feel like trees are starting to come between both of those in a very big way.  I've been spending all my money on weed and having my girlfriend pay for almost everything, and I feel like the biggest dick in the world for that.  I have been putting off getting a job for almost five years because I've never been able to pass a drug test.  My grades have been slipping and I don't wanna fail out of school being so close to being done.  

I threw out all my stuff: six bowls, a grinder, one resin covered paperclip, and a guitar pick with some kief stuck to it.  I did it right after I smoked my last bowl (with kief, it was awesome).  But as I burnt I found myself drifting off thinking about how happy I used to be and how happy everyone on here seems after they stop.  I had to think really really hard to what I used to be like four years ago and it nearly brought me to tears.  After I threw my stuff out back I went out front and smoked a cig and I finally felt like there was hope for me to stop this time.  Maybe being high and making the decision to throw my paraphernalia away wasn't the best decision but the trash comes tomorrow morning before I wake up so the tiny, non-tree obsessed, rational side of leavin yelled at the top of his tiny lungs and I did it.

I was furloughed from work a month ago for failing a drug test, and thought I was going back next week.  Now my boss is telling me that it may be longer due to a lack of work.  

I had been diagnosed with low testosterone and was taking a supplement, but now without income or insurance, I can no longer afford that.  I am not sure if that is contributing to my mental state.

I am still suffering guilt trips from lying to my family about why I was furloughed.  

I have tried meditating, but it always seems to turn into rumination.  I just keep thinking over and over how bad I have screwed up and how my actions have cost me my livelihood and how that affects those that depend on me. 

I have used my time off to get my house in order (literally) and I put together a garage sale.  Yesterday was day one and it sucked.  I felt devastated that I went through all that work and reaped a whopping $30.

I've smoked weed heavily since I was 15 - I'm 28 now and stopped smoking the stuff a few weeks ago and finally don't want to ""ent"" around anymore. It's not been easy - one way or another I would always justify why it's fine for me to keep smoking, and I do mean smoking a lot. ""Work hard, play hard"", ""I don't spend much money on other things"", ""it takes the edge off when I come home from a hard day at work"", ""it's better than drinking every night"", ""I've managed to build a successful life over the last 13 years, so it's obviously ok""...

I'm not saying, nor have I said to myself ""I'll never smoke weed again"" because that actually always seemed to make it harder to stop. Instead I'll play it by ear and see how it goes. I've had one sneaky bowl since making the conscious decision to stop, and of course it felt really good but the sheer worry of falling back into regular old habits again has made me think about it differently. Now, in my head, the negatives balance out or outweigh the positives. 

I have set up new routines for my evenings and found other ways of spending my time than getting really high - mainly playing badminton twice a week and a fair bit of pc gaming (loved the last steam sales...). Those distractions, coupled with some beers and recently maybe the odd cigarette after a few drinks (when I crave a smoke) have made stopping weed smoking surprisingly easier. Also, I feel much more productive and in control at work now - I used to think there would be no difference but it really has surprised me.

Anyway. Those were some of the things I've thought about and realised, I am kinda just thinking aloud so apologies if you've read this far and thought... ""what message are you trying to get across..."" - I really don't have one, but hey - maybe you can relate to some of what I have gone through.

I know that this is a rough idea and there are many things that could go wrong with it. I just had the idea and wanted to throw it out there, and if it is a bad idea or could not work because of a laundry list of reasons, I am fine with it.

I have been trying to quit for a while now, going a few days and then breaking down and hitting the pipe once or twice, then going clean a few more days. To help me from relapsing I got a dry erase board with a calendar and marked the days I smoked and kept the days I went clean white. This helped me out having a visual. I even made a throwaway acct and made a post here thinking that would force me to not smoke, it didnt.

I know that having some flare by my acct name doesn't mean I will be clean forever, but I do know it will help, and it could potentially help others. Seeing a flare that means that they went a week or even a month clean and that everyone else could see it, might help someone stay in check.

For example I woke up convinced that I had spent a semester in college in japan, it was so real from having memories about using google to finding the school to having transferred the credits back to my current school.  I really did wake up convinced about this fact and trying to fit it into my memory timeline, and then realized it was all just a dream due to the fact that I don't have a passport.  The sad part is that as I type this I am loosing my grasp of last night dreams and soon they will be gone.

I didn't think I'd need to write here but, as with all things challenging, the difficult bit is consistency. I haven't smoked in three weeks and those three weeks were the easiest because it was something still leaving me whereas now I'm adjusting to life without weed and it's more difficult - all the benefits I got from weed I have to replace - and all the benefits from quitting I haven't fully realized I'm experiencing. 

I'm a stand up comedian, and getting high was my source of inspiration and what got me into that ""zone"" where I could flow without worry and rely on simply losing self-consciousness - I could slip into a safe place and talk and feel comfortable, not worrying about ""making people laugh,"" just trusting in my talent and watching it flow from me. But I knew this was only a short-term solution because long-term, I saw myself forgetting things and becoming lazier and not doing as much as I thought I could. My biggest challenge now is making things fun again and becoming a social creature again without being too self-conscious. I haven't been writing, I haven't been having fun performing, even when I do well. This post is is the most I've written in three weeks, really - or at least the only concerted effort I've made at sitting down without reflecting and just writing. 

I'm starting a mindfulness meditation practice and go to the gym 6 days a week (weight training + physiotherapy). I suppose I should mention I was hit by a car (hit and run, no compensation) just after moving to London, UK and fractured a bone in my knee, tore two ligaments and had to have major surgery. This has been a bit hellish. I don't have a job because I saved for two years in Canada to move here and do this, and needless to say, didn't plan on getting hit by a car and have to recover from that so it's been challenging. A lot of the momentum and positive loop cycle I created in Canada has dissipated. Weed became a reward for being injured and my daily intake went way up - it helped with pain, and once I started performing again I came to rely even more heavily on it for having fun performances. But now that I've stopped, I have difficult staying in a positive mood - much more doubt, and my self-esteem I feel has dropped. I know what I have to do, get out and have fun, meet people, start talking to women, generate positive emotions and build the positive loop cycle up again, but I'm finding it difficult just to DO IT. Weed really helped me NOT THINK and just HAVE FUN. I think I'm just missing a social circle and I'm in a more challenging situation than I've been in for awhile (moving for a dream, no job, recovering from serious major surgery, just quit marijuana, feeling like a ""victim"" and the subsequent effects on the ego), so it's understandable, but I'm just beginning to understand the life change is the biggest challenge. Quitting is easy. Going through withdrawal wasn't bad. The worst part is learning how to do things in a way to make them as fun as when you were high. It shouldn't be easy; that's why we get high, it's so easy and the sober answer is hard. So I guess I'm asking: What do you folks do instead? I find socializing and talking to strangers gives me the same rush but I'm much more self-conscious now and my self-esteem is much lower. I guess I just have to do it. Anyway looking for help from people that have successfully REPLACED weed with something else. I'm already really active and physical, but not social enough, I have to work on that. How do you make things fun again? Can you reach the same states of consciousness without drugs? Do you feel more self-conscious? Has anyone replaced weed with something else, like meditation, and had great results? Have you been more creative or less creative since quitting? I know I'm killing this part of me and it takes time; thank Humanity we have places like this to share and comfort each other because some days are hard and often you don't want to complain in person, but anonymously ;)

My best friend and I quit together cold turkey. The first few days were hell, but by the time I made it a week I started to feel better. My appetite is starting to normalize, but it's still a bit out of whack. I can breathe so much easier, and I'm starting to have dreams again! Although they're mostly nightmares, but still... it's nice to have dreams of any sort. My sleep cycle is still pretty fucked, however. I'll sleep as much as I can through the night, but it takes me forever to fall asleep, and oftentimes I'll wake up after only 5 or so hours and be unable to fall back asleep, and then I'll take naps during the day that last 5 hours, sometimes more. Thankfully my class schedule can accommodate that.

So I'm 2/3s of the way towards breaking the habit, and my goal is to stay completely dry for 30 days at least. I'm going to Bonnaroo, and I plan to smoke there, but probably not until then. After 'Roo, I want to make smoking a very occasional treat when I have no immediate commitments. I believe I can do that, but if I can't, then I just won't smoke anymore.

I've talked about weed, seen it, smelled it, had it smoked around me, hell, a buddy was downing a blunt right in front of me, offered me a hit, and I politely turned it down. My habitual desire to smoke is just gone! I feel like I could adopt the occasional policy right now, but I want more of a break for good measure, and to let my tolerance go down even more.

I quickly developed a pretty ridiculous habit due to being able to smoke for free (1-2 grams of kush a day, for the last 5 years), but I assumed when I stopped selling I'd stop smoking. Well, I stopped selling about two years ago and here I am. Sometimes I feel like I'm chained to it. Every time I feel the slightest hint or inclination of boredom, which is basically all the time since I live a fairly lonely life and have always been pretty depressed all the time, I smoke weed. I smoke so often that a lot of the time I don't even feel like I'm getting high, but I smoke anyway.

I feel like it's a horrendous loop. I feel bored, so I smoke weed in the hopes I'll want to do something productive, but instead I just watch Netflix or surf imgur or reddit until I stop being high, then I'm bored again, so I smoke some more. I seem to waste all but a few hours of the day doing absolutely nothing and that's even more depressing. I'll try to quit at the end of a sack but I panic after a few hours and buy more, though one time I made it about a day. Even if I run out of money, I still have ABV left over from my launchbox that I can grind up and re-smoke even though it's kind of a lousy high. I feel like I need to get high so I can eat these days, most of the time.

What's worse, what I didn't even realize until I found this subreddit, is that I've felt totally alone in this. All my other stoner friends don't seem to have a problem, or at least they don't communicate they do, but maybe I don't either. I try to treat it like a joke, like ha ha I can't help but smoke weed. My ex-girlfriend was a major enabler, saying that I was obviously happier when I smoked weed but she'd never really seen me fully adjusted to being sober in the 3 years we were together, so she didn't know. I don't know. I don't really remember what not smoking weed all the time is like. The idea of not having my crutch is terrifying.

The longest break I've had is 10 days and that was just once because I was out of country.

I'm a programmer and have been able to fake it essentially all this time but I'm tired of feeling lethargic, slow and the feeling of always needing something.

I've tried in the past but have never told anyone or made a post, basically never verbalized it for myself.

I'm at a point in my life right now where failure isn't really an option anymore, I'm starting to slip in my work life. I don't eve have fun anymore honestly.

So I guess I'm just posting here today so that I have a goal, to come back tomorrow night and not have smoked. Right now a day would truly be a major achievement.

I should also note before I started smoking I always had unbelievably terrible insomnia. I think a big part of the problem is I basically fear the night without weed. Just the thought of laying in bed for 5 or 6 hours like the old days before mj is enough to keep me from missing a night unfortunately. Mind you it's been 6 years so who knows what I'm like normally these days. I know I need to stop overanalyzing it and just do it. 

Sorry for the ramble...

EDIT: Thanks a bunch to all of you who have commented. Got up with unbelievable cravings and the feeling of ""I'll just get some today and start quitting tomorrow,"" but after reading the comments I held it together and am just going to go for a drive down the coast instead. Waste of gas and no real goal but it's not smoking which is all that matters. Thanks again.

P.S. to furbowski: Thanks for the heads up on the horrible emotional rambling part, already felt that coming up around a friend this morning. Virtually no one knows I have this problem though so I've been keeping it bottled up.

Having some support here is great 

EDIT 2:

FUCK, well day 1 was a failure. It's odd because every other failure has happened almost instantly, like just an hour or two after waking up. But this time I actually went through the whole day without it, forced myself to go to the gym and do other things. Really felt like it was changing for once but I got home, and it got dark, and once I ran out of things to do and finally sat at my computer the cravings came and now at 9pm I have ended up having a bowl. The worst part about it is I'm sitting here now after hitting it and I honestly don't even feel like I needed it. The worst part is feeling like I could have really made it through this day 1 for once cuz it really did feel different from my other attempts.

I'm not giving up though, for the amount I smoke just going through the day time without smoking is a huge accomplishment (I know it may not seem like it but with my use it really is). Also when I was doing things today I wasn't constantly thinking about how I would rather be smoking, I was actually focused on the activities which is also a first. So tomorrow begins day 1, again.

I've been struggling a lot in life over the last year, financially, with my education, with work, and at points even with friends, family, and other relationships.  Now, granted, marijuana has not, nor ever was, been part of the problem, this needs to be noted.  As time went on I had become increasingly less and less satisfied by my current life path, mostly I was starting to stagnant, not go forward, and did not want to end up living a life that does not amount to much of anything. So I decided to make a change.

Since high school I had mildly contemplated a military lifestyle for myself but as I neared graduation I stopped giving two shits and just wanted to live life and have fun. Fast forward four years to now, I have nothing to show for that other than a lot of wasted money and time.  Time for change. I went and took an ASVAB test, excelled on it, and was given the opportunity to take any job I wanted in the military (Evidently I scored well enough that doors that weren't open could be opened for me). I got those results back the week before Christmas. That night I smoked with friends, we piled all our kief together, and I still had most of an ounce of shwag. We rolled a bunch of joints, made a kief puck, smoked the ever loving shit out of everything. I gave away all the green I had left, my grinder, roller, pipe, dug out, papers, all of it. Haven't touched it in the two weeks since.

I pissed clean on my home drug test today, next week I'll walk back into the recruiters office and enlist. Hopefully this is the start of something new and amazing in my life. It will be sad to leave this old part of me behind. It was wonderful fun, I made some amazing friends, had experiences I never would have dreamed of, went places, saw and did things, met people that I never would have done without it. 99% of those were all good, too.

But marijuana will now become that ex that you deeply loved but just have to walk away from because you need to go a different direction in life. I loved her, and she loved me, however it's time to part ways. So I have, and maybe one day I can take her back in my arms and love her again. But for now, it's time to be responsible and make something of my life; and I can't do that with her.

But some of the stories about not going anywhere with your lives and being lazy have hit the mark with me because I had a similar realization a number of years back.

I was a young buck in a law school near the beach. I had a beach condo that I shared with two other roommates. After living in this condo for about 2 months and watching another endless Seinfeld marathon I looked out the huge floor-to-ceiling windows at the surfers and looked at my guitar in the corner of the room. Then I turned back to Seinfeld and realized that I knew every line of every episode that I had seen and could nearly quote verbatim the upcoming episodes just by looking at their titles.

It made me sad. Here I am, young, living on a beach, and I'm wasting it away watching Seinfeld. How boring could I be?

So, the next day I bought a surfboard and turned off the cable (still kept internet :-)

As time went on, that surfboard turned into two surfboards. I added a wakeboard to the collection and when I moved to snowier climes I've now got two snowboards as well. I'm much more social and when people ask me what I did over the weekend I generally have a fun travel or adventure story instead of a usual ""it was good"" or ""I relaxed"" response.

Clearly weed wasn't my laziness trigger, but if you're in here it might be (probably is) yours.

Good luck to all of you trying to make more out of your life. All the best to you, and if you're near Columbus, Ohio and you are trying to figure out what in gods name to do with your time now that you aren't high, feel free to hit me up.

In December of '09, my boyfriend and I got into a car accident and he passed away. After that I sort of turned to pot to keep myself happy and distracted.
Over the time I've been smoking, which I have gotten to the point of doing several times a day, I've developed really horrible anxiety. I don't blame it entirely on the weed but I feel that it plays a role.

My blood pressure has been ridiculously high. Everytime I have a small symptom of illness, I break down in fear of dying. And in the past, every time I turned to smoking to make me feel better. Now I see that I have bigger demons to deal with and smoking my prime years away has only been pushing all of it deeper inside. 
So I've decide to stop self-medicating and relying on a plant to function. I want to be myself. Today is day two and I've already had two separate panic attacks. But I will not cave in and smoke, I am determined to work through my problems without abusing any substance.

For the first time ever, I didn't smoke before work, I didn't smoke during my lunch break, and I didn't smoke before sleeping. In the past 2 weeks I've cut down from 6-7 bowls a day to 1-2. And none of those times now are during a time that could be detrimental(like work, with parents, etc). I enjoy smoking weed now and can finally enjoy it responsibly for the first time in years. So thanks r/leaves for helping me through this!

1375573322.0,16,self.leaves,1jnhs6,"After 3 years of addiction to synthetics, I've been clean for two months",kaflowsinall,17,1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1jnhs6/after_3_years_of_addiction_to_synthetics_ive_been/,"This is going to be a wall of text, and I apologize in advance, but I would like to tell a story of how I had been addicted to synthetic marijuana.

In May 2009, I was introduced to synthetic marijuana at a party.  I took two hits of a synthetic that my friend had bought, and later real marijuana, combined with copious amounts of alcohol and I had a good time.  I noted that after I had used the synthetic and before anything else that night that it was an okay high, pretty mellow but short-lived, nothing special.  I was only a social user at parties and small get-togethers, but after that night I stayed away from marijuana and synthetics, because I was going to school for criminal justice and wanted to get a job in the field (law-enforcement officer).

In summer 2010, I was relatively stressed out (if that's not a cliche rationalization, I don't know what is) and decided to look for synthetics online.  I made a couple of purchases over a couple of months, $20 here, $20 there.  I was generally responsible with my usage - I would only use after work or a few hours before work (food-service industry) so I'd be sober, and I wouldn't carry it with me in my car.  (I'd like to say that I tried not to drive high, but that was only true for about a week.)  My use was probably 1.5g a week.

In late 2010, for problems that I've always told myself were unrelated to my synthetic use but *might* be related (I guess I was getting pretty irritable), my boss let me go because ""the company was trying to move forward and it seems you're not trying to move with it"".  My job was my life and this hit me pretty hard.  I had been going through a little depression before-hand, coupled with my synthetic use, and this drove it deeper.  I continued to use synthetics but since I was unemployed, my use went up.  Not quite to the addiction phase, but maybe 2-3g a week.

Around early 2011, I discovered you can buy the research chemicals online and make your own synthetics cheaply and easily.  I bought a few different variations of JWH and some damiana and started making my own batches.  The shit was so ridiculously cheap that my use went up dramatically, because even though I was unemployed, seriously, it was ridiculously cheap.  This was also the period that I noticed that I had to ""redose"" constantly due to the short-lived effects of synthetics.

At this point, I still didn't feel that I was addicted.  Even though my use was pretty constant (I lived alone and used from the time I woke up to the time I fell asleep), I didn't feel that I ""had to have it"".  My grandmother died in April and I was clean for the three days I was out-of-town with my family, and I didn't feel withdrawals or anything.  Of course, the first thing I did when I got back was hit the bong, so your judgment may vary.

This went on until May 2011.  While concocting my own batches, I stuck strictly to the JWH line of research chemicals.  The vendor I purchased it from online had just started to stock AM-2201, which was supposed to be relatively similar, so I tried some of that.  On my first use, I had a major panic attack in which I started contemplating my eternal soul and the fact that I was a complete and utter waste of a husk of a human.  I tried to calm myself down by sitting in front of a mirror and saying ""It's just a chemical, it will pass, it will only take time"".  I eventually called my brother (who knew nothing of what was going on with me) and told him I was having a bad trip and needed him to come get me.  By the time he and his wife came over (at 1 am), the effects had worn off, but during my panic attack I took all of the chemicals and batches I had and thrown them away.

After that, I was sober for six months.  In August 2011 I graduated with a psychology degree and in December I graduated with my criminology degree.  In November, however, I decided once again to start using synthetics.  Of course I remembered my bad trip, but I rationalized it as best as I could.  This time I didn't purchase packs or research chemicals online and instead turned to head shops.  About once a week I would go for a long drive, stop at a head shop, buy a couple week's worth of synthetics ($150), and go home.

In April 2012, I got a job as a security officer.  I again tried to be as responsible as I could, never smoking before work.  This time, however, I would keep it in my car and immediately dose on my 40 minute drive home.

In late July, Operation Log Jam shut down 2 of the 3 head shops that I visited, and the third one stopped carrying synthetics.  I was forced to quit cold turkey, and I felt a little bit of withdrawal (irritability, ""butterflies"" in my stomach), but it wasn't as bad as I expected.  I was sober for another 3 months.  It was also around this time that I got promoted to a different post for my job, so I figured it was probably a good idea to make sure my mind was clear as it was a supervisor position.

In November 2012, for the third time, I decided to pick synthetics back up for the same reasons as before (""I just wanted to unwind"").  This time I tried online vendors again, and this is where I really started to feel the effects of addiction.  I would order one pack and it would satiate my need.  I would try another one and if it turned out to be crap (eg it didn't have any synthetic chemicals that worked for me), I would start to feel heavy withdrawals while waiting for the next shipment.  Again, I would be irritable, get butterflies in my stomach, dry-heave, and sleeping was very difficult.  Once I got a batch that worked for me, it seemed like all of my issues would melt away within seconds of the first hit.

In January of this year, I stuck primarily with one specific brand from a specific vendor.  I used the vendor because they had free 2-day shipping, so when I got low, I could place an order on Wednesday morning and have the product in my mailbox when I got off work on Friday.  Again, I noticed a problem when I would have heavy withdrawal symptoms if I ran out early or the shipment was late.

During this time, I would dose as often as possible while I was not at work, including on the way there.  I worked 6a-2p, and I would be hitting the pipe as I was pulling into the parking lot at 5:55.  It was easy to get away with it because I would just sit in my office for an hour and read the news while the effects wore off.  As I mentioned, I worked security, and there was almost nothing to do.

I quit my job in April because it was an absolute clusterfuck and I found out that I hate being bored out of my mind at work.

On Memorial Day of this year, while watching the music video for [Macklemore - Otherside](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvDQy53eldY), I kinda had a small breakdown.  The music video deals with addictions and it just seemed to hit me right in the feels.  I started crying and decided that enough was enough.  I got in my car and drove to my parents' house.  On the way there, I called my brother and told him that I needed someone to talk to.  When I got to my parents', I told them that I wanted to sell my house and move back in with them because I was tired of being alone.  I didn't mention to either of them that I had a problem with synthetics, but I don't think that matters - I think what matters most is that I haven't used anything since that day.

It took some time to get used to, but I feel a lot better now.  I went through some withdrawals but it only lasted a week or two (trouble sleeping, but that may have been due to changing environments from my house to my parents' house).  I have started running twice a week and plan to run a half-marathon with my friend in October.

My addiction seems to be under control, but I'm afraid that if the synthetic industry gets to be popular again, I may be tempted to buy some.  If that happens, I'll just try to remember how terrible it felt when I would run out of product and how pissed I'd be that I'd have to go a weekend without anything, and how I never want to have to feel that way again.

(A bit lengthy),ehngage,16,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1iozrd/finally_gonna_do_it_a_bit_lengthy/,"Well, I've been lurking here for a few weeks and been trying to quit for a while now and I decided maybe posting here will help.

I'll start from the beginning which was about 3-4 (i don't quite remember) years ago in grade 11. One of my best friends knew I was interested in trying pot, and he'd smoked once before so he managed to find us some. Needless to say, I had an amazing time. I smoked about 5 times that whole year and then quit for my grade 12 year. Met a girl it got pretty serious and here's where I made the first mistake, we got married right after highschool. We started smoking together, daily. This was fun for the first few weeks until it started just masking problems her and I were having, never actually fixing them, just getting angry, smoking a bowl or two and forgetting about it, repeat next day. So that went on for about a year until she ended up cheating on me with 1. A guy online who she (never met) ""Fell in love"" with and broke up with a week later 2. My ex best friend (Not the one who introduced me to weed).

So after that year of daily weed smoking and a horrible relationship, I kinda fell off the train, and got pretty heavy in to Methylone (If you don't know what it is its a ""safer"" version of MDMA, that is legal. I abused this stuff pretty hard for the next 6-8 months only going 2-4 days max without taking a little bit. Picked up drinking and cigarettes while I was at it too. It took me until Jan 2013 to quit Methylone and Drinking, and until about april 2013 to quit cigarettes. Yet through all of those substances, weed has stayed, all day every day. Its the only substance I feel I can't give up. So now its July 2013 a year after my break up, and I wanna get on my feet, go to school, get a job, get my motivation back, stop being lazy and generally just feel happy towards life again. I am scheduled to see a counsellor in August for weed, but I didn't want to wait that long to tell somebody. 

 I believe I'm over my ex and that whole situation (I had therapy for that many months ago), but now I've found a new thing to be depressed about, which is the state of where my life is headed, if I don't quit smoking I see myself homeless within a year, and without friends. 

Sorry for the long rant, but I dunno, I guess I just had to let it out.

How many of you are going to/ been to a therapist?  How did it help?  I'm also curious what the first visit is like.  Do you just puke your story out in one session, or is it more of a slow release?

Dear __, 

You tried pot for the first time in Grade 11. You smoked more at school, and became a 'stoner' when you started dating LR. When he was on the scene you started smoking more, more turned into daily, and daily turned into several times a day- a lot of the times alone. The only thing you wanted to do was be high, be high at the gym, be high doing art, be high doing math, be high around him. 

Weed numbs your emotions, you were very depressed and anxious, smoking helped. Smoking also masked what was an extremely violent and abusive relationship as healthy, and after you figured out it was unhealthy it allowed you to stay in it for much longer than you should have been. Being high allowed you to compromise your mind, your emotions, and your body to your ex-boyfriend and kept you there. You knew he will filling your baggie up, even if he did it when you were gone and even if he didn't tell you. You knew that not wanting to be around him sober was a problem. You knew that being high stopped you from looking around at the mess you were in. You kept making excuses, and you knew, deep down, that what was going on was wrong, but you kept making excuses. As much as people are telling you what happened 'is not your fault', it is your fault because you knowingly numbed your brain so that you could ignore what was going on around you. I suspect part of you did it because you wanted to keep smoking weed. 

The last two years of your life have been a wreck. I know it's not just because of smoking, I know that you had real, tangible problems and that wanting to feel numb instead of panic or sadness is completely justified. 

But I pose the question, what would your life be like if you weren't smoking weed? Would all of those bad things have happened? Would you have allowed the past to dictate your future so strongly? Would you have been able to socialize and take pleasure in school and everyday activities? I suspect the answer is yes. 

Remember who you were before all of this started? Remember what you used to get accomplished? People are telling you are depressed, and eventually you will return to normal BUT YOU WON'T IF YOU KEEP SMOKING. 

Today you have to stop. Today is the first day of a new era, and there can't be any compromises because a compromise to smoke is putting your future and you at risk. 

Good luck, don't give up, and please be strong.

Anyway, so I get that that's bad, which is why I've decided to stop (for the millionth time), but because I'm just so used to using weed to distract myself going without it SUUUUUUCKS.

I made the decision to quit smoking 25 days ago.  I have been smoking quite a bit for around 5 years.  Someday 3 joints and day, sometimes only one a week.  I tried stopping a few times, but always fell back to it.  

I decided to quit because it was getting back to the state I always hated, where I wanted to smoke, and could think of nothing else.  I was at a friend’s house, having some drinks, having fun, but wanted to smoke.  Ended up leaving the party, just to find my friend and burn one.  I realised how many times I had done this.  Leaving entertaining events, just because I wanted to smoke.  How often I had said I was going to cut down or quit, only to slowly start up again.  Just once a week became every other day, became every day, became buying a quarter, became 3 a day again.  And I was sick of it.  

Smoking friends told me now to worry so much, I didn’t smoke as much as they did, so why the issue, weed is non-addictive so there’s no issue, and all the other reasons smokers give.

But I know the truth, ANYTHING is addictive.  It’s the habits you get into.  It’s not how much physically I smoked, but the fact that each time, it became the only thing I wanted to do.  If I was drinking the way I smoke, where I couldn't have alcohol in the house without drinking it, where I was going out of my way to have a drink.  Couldn't concentrate if I knew I could have a drink after work, then I’d be an alcoholic.

Mainly I’ve been okay.  The first few days were difficult, as they always are.  Knowing that I wanted to not smoke made me want to even more.  But I realised I was at 3 weeks into it, and doing well.  I was okay.

But the last 2 days, I’ve just felt really bad.  I’ve read what others have said, about feeling more motivated, less anxious, happier.  But I’ve been feeling the opposite.  I have zero motivation to do anything.  Nothing is interesting me, enthralling me, I can’t concentrate on anything.  I’ve not felt like going out since quitting, not in a ‘if I can’t smoke there’s no point’, I just plain did not feel like it.  And I’ve felt incredibly low.  I’ve felt more tired each morning.  I didn’t smoke before sleeping (I realised a long time ago that weed did nothing for my sleeping patterns, it was just one of the lies smokers tell themselves ‘I can only sleep if I’m stoned’).

Right now, I just want to smoke one, put on some good music and think some amazing thoughts.
For ages that was always my issue.  I wanted to quit.  But only when I smoked.  Until I got high, all I could think of was getting high.  Then once I had, I realised I needed to stop.  It took the buzz to wake my mind up to what it was doing.

I hope I carry on.  I don’t want to smoke, because I know that getting high won’t suddenly make it all okay.  But right now it’s just hard.

Any words of wisdom, of advise on how to get through the tougher days?

So I'm now going on 4 days without smoking after a month or two of indulgence. I've had to quit before after getting tested a work, did good, then started again. Same cycle after new years, but after my birthday and 420 (same weekend), I promised myself I'd detox. But fuuuuuuck this was not a good one.

I've seen some postings here from people who get the shakes or DT, who get insomnia or mood swings. Last time I detoxed it wasn't so bad, but it was over the weekdays, so I had work to distract me and a routine that would ensure I still ate and took care of myself.

Not this weekend. I felt like shit. No motivation and no appetite, which made the fact that I already have depression even worst (when I don't eat I get moody, low blood sugar and all. Not serious, but a factor). To top it off I went to my folks house and misinterpreted something my Dad said as a dig at me and was sick last night over the emotional fallout from it. I wanted a smoke so bad, and it didn't help the temptation when I found a small stash my mom left out (Side-note, she was just diagnosed with cancer again and we know from experience smoking helps her mood, her pain, and her appetite.) 

Thankfully I didn't, I resisted, but I was so hurt inside I was desperate to numb myself. But the past few days have not been fun, and I have to say this detox experience was so bad I don't want to start smoking again in case I need to get clean again. it sucks and it's just not worth the moment of pleasure pot gives you.

Now I'm ok. I'm at work (breaking stuff, that helps), and my dad and I talked about what set me off. I see a doctor regularly and will see him this afternoon to talk about things. 

But for those of you looking to quit, know that your body is going to respond to the detox, sometimes very strongly. Keep busy, avoid temptation, and stay strong brothers.

I am really grateful for everything this subreddit has taught me, even if it has just been as little as a few words of support. 

As a college student living alone, I've been smoking everyday for a little over a year now during my school semester. I came to realize that my whole life revolved around smoking. I'd plan my day around getting high which meant ignoring my responsibilities and even lying to those close to me just for a chance at getting high. I would always focus on getting high and then immediately feel guilty for blowing off everything else just for 1 or 2 hours of pleasure. Eventually I saw that this had become a problem. It came to the point where I decided to quit.

Since my school semester was about to end when I decided to stop smoking, I figured I'd stop at the end of my 2012 school semester, when I'd finally go back to stay with my parents and become completely disconnected with my normal routine. Ever since I've found this thread and have gone back home its been 40 days since I've stopped smoking. Even though I'm really proud of myself, I think I've been able to abstain from smoking mostly because of the advice given in this subreddit and because I've been spending my vacation back at home with my parents. 

Back home I rarely go out, I don't know any dealers and I don't really have any friends that smoke so, even though its been rough the last weeks, it has been a LITTLE bit easier just because I haven't really been tempted nor have I had it easily accessible to me. I feel as if being back home has brought me to a safe haven where I am disconnected with my old habits of meeting with my friends and smoking. Though I admit that I have relapsed twice since I decided to quit I felt awful afterwards and continued to remain clean after my moments of weakness. I have come to realize that I CAN live without this drug when I'm not tempted.

/r/leaves, I ask one more favor of you: I am about to return to school for my final semester and I want to prove to myself that I can undo my old ways. How can I go back to having weed easily accessible and STILL say no? I think I will be able to say no most of the times but I am afraid that, in a moment of weakness, I will give in and smoke again. 


TL;DR: I stopped smoking partially because I completely isolated myself from weed. Now that I will have drugs readily available to me, how can I say no and not give in?",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_16qgws,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/16qgws/thanks_for_everything_rleaves_but_i_need_more/,

I used to be totally addicted to the stuff (age 17-4 months ago). I would spend $75 a week or more on it (I live on SSI so that's everything I have to live on pretty much, not including rent) but I was so HAPPY. I could still do just fine in school, and I actually had friends. The reason I quit though- was because it made me hear voices. I'm bipolar, and legally insane. I've been to 5 hospitals in the past 3 years because of the drug, so you can imagine why I'm staying away from it. Without moderation, I start thinking and obsessing over death and evil things I'd otherwise avoid. I wish I could just smoke once a week and live normally, except for the fact that I can't control myself. Once I start, I can't enjoy life unless I'm high. Whenever I'm sober I just count down the days or minutes until that first inhale. I'm sorry, I've been fighting this addiction with the help of my internet friends, but it's so hard to be a loner in real life. I had to stop talking to all my friends- that's right, ALL of them, because they all smoked, and I'm way too anxious sober to talk to anyone without freaking the ef out. 

I've tried taking medications for my depression since I was 14 (I'm 20 now). 17 different kinds, and they've all made me worse. The only thing that's ever helped was weed.. until it made me crazy 

My happiness is also relative to the amount of friends I have. Mostly everyone my age has at-least one friend, and knows how to act normally socially, and those that don't are hidden like me somewhere unobtainable. 

I'm stuck. I almost rode my bike into a city looking for dealers a few hours ago. I.. want to get freakin' high, and forget everything. My responsibilities, my pain, my horrible life. 

As you can see with my username, I am very religious. I don't really think God would mind if I smoked, as long as I used the stuff medicinally and it were helpful for my life overall. Unfortunately it's more of a set-back than anything, for all the reasons I've given. *sigh*

It was making me dumb, and I was incredibly depressed. I went a couple weeks without smoking and felt better, but shamefully slipped a couple times along the way. Then I went home for Christmas break, and met up with all of my old friends, who are all smokers. My brother is also a huge stoner, and my parents let him smoke in the house (they don't really let him, he just does it anyways). I told myself to be strong, but I ended up smoking. A lot. And every time I did it, I felt more ashamed of myself, and more antisocial. But a weird thing happened around Christmas: I stopped wanting to smoke. And not like how I wanted to quit before, but was still tempted; I mean I don't have the urge to smoke anymore. I know what it does to me every time I do, and I don't like that me. I don't like bring paranoid, or waking up with a headache the next day, or having my brain fried so I sound stupid for the next couple days. It's oddly liberating, but I now have to come to terms with what I've done to my life ever since I started smoking. I blew off making friends to get high, I dropped out of classes because I was always too tired to go to them in the morning, and wasted dozens of opportunities to better myself, just because I wanted to smoke. Smoking wasn't the problem, it was that I chose smoking over doing the right thing, and because of that reason, I fucked up my life. Now it's time to begin trying to rebuild my life, which is way harder than just quitting smoking.

I need to find some non-smoking friends, maybe a girlfriend, just something to boost my confidence and remind me that there are actual benefits to being clean.

I can admit now that I messed things up and wasn't careful because I was high.

Ever since, I get very anxious about flying, which I do several times per year. I smoked while packing and as I headed out the door. 

I see now that smoking probably made my anxiety worse, not better. 

If I think carefully, I can see that some return flights from a few (sober) days with my family, I did not feel anxious. I blamed that on other things -- such as, the small regional airport near them is less scary than the large international one near where I live.

I'm still unemployed and even though I can fill my time, everyday when the sun sets I get intense cravings to call up a dealer and buy just a gram, but I know that once I start with that I'll be buying eights then q's again and be smoking all day everyday.

It's so strange, each day I have to talk myself out of it.  It's like two contending forces, one that says ""Hey, you're unemployed, got nothign better to do.  Why not just buy a gram and have some fun?""  Where the other force is saying ""Don't do it!  You've made it this far and you might get called in for an interview.  Do you really want to worry about failing a test now?""

Gosh, it's such a struggle, but luckily the no part has been winning out.  I don't even know why I struggle with it.  Weed was making me super anxious and paranoid and even though I keep telling myself it's really not that great and I'm not missing anything, there's still that little voice saying ""come on, just a gram.""

I'm an 11 year pot smoker who recently has gone from a Q/O a week habit down to less than an eighth and I see myself continuing to lessen. 

I have kept this schedule up for 2 weeks and am entering my 3rd week. I never thought it would be possible to reduce the amount I smoke, but because of breathing issues, I have no choice.

I am one of the ""rare"" or at least uncommon individuals that feel intense withdrawals from pot, and my cold turkey experiences in the past have always left with some PTSD, and I feel I can't just quit without going insane.

I decided that I had to do something different, even if it wasn't the ideal thing, so I just started using less pot each day, even though I know smoking = bad for my lungs, I couldn't stop it, so I went with smoke less &gt; smoking more. The least of all evils, would this decision pay off? ..... YES!

So each day the goal is simply to not smoke more than the previous day, and ideally smoke a tiny bit less, and never have my withdrawal symptoms go beyond minor.

I've learned a few ground rules:

-----------------
My willpower dramatically lessens after that first toke, so try and delay the first toke as long as possible without inducing moderate or severe withdrawals. 

Cognitive Behavior Therapy to deal with the mental shit that comes up while you have perpetual transient withdrawals during the tapering. 

Enough product to allow you to consistently use without interrupting your tapering routine.

Use Pavlovian conditioning to program myself when it's ok to smoke, i.e. have your first smoke under the same conditions each day. (same song(looping), same lighting, same room, same time or a little later).

-----------------

The first day I made it to 11:00. I repeated this a few times, then made it to 12:00, 1:00, ... and now I'm up to 4:20 pm. 

So I wake up around 8:00 am and can delay my first toke to 4:20is pm. This is unheard of for me, I used to wake and bake till my eyes bled. 

The cognitive behavior therapy is extremely useful in helping plan out my day and dynamically handle the typical bullshit humans have to experience on the daily. 

The CBT isn't enough to help me quit by itself, but when I combine with this tapering schedule, I feel incredibly powerful. 

So far in just 2 weeks, my energy is way better, I don't feel lost in my thoughts as much, I'm more present, and I've cut amount of weed intake by 50%, from a Q/O to an eighth a week.

I was, until yesterday, a day in, day out smoker of around two years. I'd wake up, pack a bowl and then start the day. If I wasn't working, I'd be smoking. If I was working, as soon as I get home I'd be smoking again.

One of my major problems with quitting will be the fact that I would mix the cannabis with tobacco. While it may not have been a huge amount, I know it has attributed to my addiction.

I've been off pot for almost a year now, was really easy at first because the consequences of it really freaked me out. Lately I've been getting urges again though..

After I started, I didn't stop for a long time. I started at the end of the 10th grade, kept going til the middle of 12th grade. Might not seem that long, but everyday of half my high school career was long for me. But as I kept going I realized that my memory and other skills that usually came easy to me were starting to suffer. So I stopped. I'm currently in my 2nd year at university.

This caused riffs between a best friend and I, she didn't respect my decision to stop and in response went totally overboard in demonstrating how pro-pot she was. I didn't take it well and made rude comments back to her whenever she called me a straight-edge..it was a tough time, I felt like no one really thought I was making a good decision no matter what it was. I stopped talking to her and have been really productive in my life so far, but I think she's regretting her decisions and started messaging me again.

She always invites me to eat brownies, or smoke a spliff knowing full well that I'd have to reject because I'm just not into that anymore. Truthfully I wouldn't mind reuniting but I just can't, I feel like her intentions are not good at all and that she just wants me to cave. I'm not sure how to explain this though without sounding condescending (or her interpreting it as condescending). How can I explain what exactly it is I'm going through?

I was first introduced to it as a junior in high school at age 17.  I remember being completely scrambled the first few times I got high, and I remember the first time I actually enjoyed the feeling, maybe the 5th or 6th time in.  Well from there, that was pretty much it.  In my senior year of high school I was smoking daily- before school, after school, before dinner, after dinner, before bed- you get the idea.  I lived for the next time I was going to smoke.  When I couldn't find it, I would call up everyone in my phonebook that I knew smoked, even if just a little, bugging them to ask if anyone could score me some bud.  I was a fucking fiend for the plant.  I got into college and one my first day I was just looking for another stoner friend (which I found plenty of) I'm sure this all sounds familiar to most of ya.  Well anyway, fast forward a bit.  I'm in my 5th year of school (could have been done in 4, no thanks to weed)  and I've been smoking daily since age 18- I'm 23 now, so 5 years of daily smoking has definitely taken it's toll on my developing brain.  And when I say daily I mean morning noon and night and any time in between.  At age 20 I experienced my first panic attack after getting high, which led to me almost fainting and a slew of other issues.  This was so unexpected and new that I didnt know what was happening to me.  I continued to smoke, and every time I would have a panic-like reaction.  I started having terrible anxiety which manifested into a ton of physical symptoms, heart palpitations, hot flashes, insomnia, depression- the whole shebang.  I reluctantly stopped smoking for as long as I could tolerate, a few weeks at most.  I went onto the SSRI Lexapro and after 4 weeks or so I felt ""normal"" again and kept smoking like I always have.  Around this time a friend of mine was pushing a lot of weight, and offered to front me some bud to sell.  I was stoked on the idea of free weed + profiting off of what I love to do.  We ended up in a very successful business endeavor selling to friends and other college kids and never had any issues with the law or getting robbed or anything like that.  So it's definitely fair to say the past 2 years I've been smoking a *fucking ton*.  I was able to quit both of my jobs and live off of the money I was making selling bud.  At the beginning of the summer I decided my anxiety was gone and I no longer needed to take Lexapro.  I weaned off over the summer and  to make a long story short, that was a bad. fucking. idea.  I was smoking just as much as ever still with no issues, but about 4 weeks after my last dose of Lexapro I got high and had a terrible rebounding anxiety attack.  I felt faint, had to lie down, and got these terrible body/muscle tremors.  The anxiety lasted into the next few days.  I tried smoking again and it just made it worse.  One night it was so bad that I took myself to the ER to get a script for some benzos to dull my nerves, thinking that was the only thing that would help me and I was right.  After 6 hours in the ER getting all kind of assessments, I got a month long benzo script and was told to get back on the Lexapro.  During the first 6 weeks of weaning onto Lexapro it makes your anxiety much worse, which the benzos help with.  I'm currently about 3 weeks into taking the Lexapro again and I feel like its just starting to take effect.  I made the mistake of trying to smoke again last night and had terrible anxiety (who would have fucking guessed?)  I wasnt home and didnt have my benzo bottle on me so I drove home a nervous wreck to take one, and I finally decided this is fucking it with the weed.  The effects are no longer desirable and I just want to feel that clarity of not being in a marijuana induced haze every day.  I still sell bud and have absolutely no desire to smoke any of it.  It feels good to get all of this off my chest to a group of people who know exactly where I'm coming from.  I want to hear from some of you who have been suffering some marijuana-induced anxiety and hear how you learned to cope with it.  I just want to share my opinion, I am living proof that marijuana has a lasting effect on your developing mind and alters your brain chemistry.  I just hope that things can go back to normal for me, I want to feel like my energetic, happy self again without having to use marijuana for that instant euphoria.  I'm still suffering from some mild anxiety while the Lexapro kicks in again, which will hopefully subside with time.  I think it would be ideal to use marijuana on only the special-est of occasions, max twice a month.  Sorry to blast you all with this wall of text, but it feels great to get these feelings out to everyone here.  Phew.

I know this is important to you guys, just like it was to me. I know the feeling of weakness, helplessness, and desperation. But you can take control of this beast. I thought it would never happen to me, but pot no longer has ANY control over me. It CAN happen. Read on if you've got some minutes.

From about age 17 to 25, I was a heavy smoker. Started smoking daily very quickly. I was straight edge up until that point and I remember when I was first introduced to it at a party and absolutely fell in love with the feeling. Eventually it got worse. I would LOVE smoking alone and just doing absolutely nothing productive. When I didn't have it, I would fiend like crazy. Driving an hour one way to score some pot was NOT beyond me in any sense. Every morning, I would wake up from being stoned the night before feeling so goddamn HEAVY. You know what I mean? Just like weighed down both mentally and physically. Every morning, I'd wrestle with myself on my drives to work, saying that I needed to stop. But every night there I was rolling a spliff and loving it. I tried to stop s many times but couldn't.

At that time, I wasn't doing anything with myself. I was in a band that I was trying to take seriously but it wasn't going anywhere. I had a day job but had no college degree. I was living on my own after my folks kicked me out of the house and sold it, so I legit had no recourse. My girlfriend ended up leaving me because she got fed up with me always smoking. This was the start of it all.

The change didn't happen right away. In many ways, after the gf left I went even deeper in. I started hanging out with old friends and we'd smoke and drink a lot. I don't know if you could call it ""getting my fill"" but one night I decided I was unsatisfied. I was going to get my girlfriend back and make some big moves to turn everything around. The first thing I knew I had to take care of was the pot.

I went to Marijuana Anonymous, but only for a couple of meetings. It had a huge effect. The full weight of my addiction fell right on me. I was no longer on the other side of the fence, looking at all the afflicted. I was one of them. And I had to admit that I was powerless to stop it. It's important to make this admission in the right context, and MA is one of those contexts where admitting your weakness ends up making you strong.

I still didn't stop smoking right away, even after the meetings. I had ti LINK the quitting to something else. I think this is the secret. You need to construct that link to other things in life that you hope to achieve. For me, I had two links, that I absolutely KNEW I had to quit to make happen: getting my gf back, and getting into med school.

This is already getting too detailed, so I'll skip ahead. I quit cold turkey for a year and a half. I avoided it like the plague. I would even ask my roommate to not smoke anywhere near me. After that I felt empowered in my success, I allowed myself to partake. Remember, this was a full year and a half later. Not 9 months, not 10 months. A year and a half. And I made the realization that I had successfully filled the hole that pot left with OTHER things. Yes, I got my gf back, and yes I was making my way toward med school with great undergraduate grades and worthy extracurricular activities. In essence, I did all the things that being a pothead would make impossible, for me. So these new things that were generating happiness in my life: school, gf, a sense of purpose were all DEPENDENT on my not smoking.

And the craziest thing is that this has changed my actual brain chemistry. How do I know? For pot, I could take it or leave it now. This is TRUE success. Now I'm not TRYING to avoid it, and I never even think about it! You know how they say that hating your ex doesn't mean you're over them, that you're only over them when you are completely indifferent? That's what this is. It even has a different effect on me now. I don't even like the feeling anymore! So I have additional protection against this addiction. 

Just a word of warning against being too cavalier with success: if you slip -and I almost did many times- into not just doing it once or twice here and there, but in getting back to a PATTERN, then YOU MUST STOP. You must stop while you still have the power. Your reason for stopping? BECAUSE YOU CAN. You need to tell yourself on a Friday night when you've got nothing to do and everyone is smoking up that you're not going to smoke simply because you want to exercise the ability to say no. This is a bit of an advanced tactic for people already on their way, but it will protect against relapse. Flaunt your power to deny it, and flaunt it frequently.

Thank you for reading this far. I know that not many people understand this struggle or how important it is to some of us. If anyone has questions, please ask and I'll be happy to help.

And by the way, I just started my first year of med school. My MCAT score (medical college admissions test) was in the 95th percentile.

I have attempted many times to discontinue my pot smoking. I have been to many AA meetings, and a few NA meetings off and on since I was 16. I have never been able to stay clean.

Unfortunately, throughout all these years, I have never gone more than 2 weeks without a drink or smoke. This summer I lived with my parents and quit smoking weed everyday. Now I have moved back to school, and the old habit is right back. I am now smoking everyday.

Today I bombed a test. Tomorrow I have another test. Tomorrow's will be more difficult, and I am really worried that I'm going to fail it. 

I feel like I have lost the ability to complete school work. I am constantly behind. Alcohol and weed are definitely contributing factors. I am currently a 6th year senior attempting to complete my undergrad, but I am on the verge of failing this semester.

If I were to leave college with no degree, 3/4 of the way done, after 6 years... it just seems like it would be too much to handle. My life would be over...

If I fail out of college, I feel like I will have ruined my life completely. Just thinking about this right now is making it close to impossible to focus on my studies. I feel like I might need to go to rehab... but I'm in the middle of a semester. 

I'm very lost and confused. I'm almost in pain. Maybe college just isn't for some people? Maybe I do need to go to rehab? The things holding me back are the humiliation and expense. Not to mention the expense of a semester thats already paid for that would go to waste.

I don't know how to feel. I am paralyzed by stress at the moment (and need to be studying hard!). I almost feel like throwing up.

And it was amazing. I laughed, I made friends, I was happy, it helped me to cope. 

At first. Now, 12 years later, it doesn't do this. Instead it makes me want to do nothing but sit in my room and watch films. I lose the ability to talk to people, I have no motivation, I'm tired all the time. All of the things that weed first helped with are now being compounded by it. I know this because there have been times when I've stopped smoking for a while and my energy goes up and I'm suddenly a social butterfly. Then I have a spliff and, bang, I'm back in my room not wanting to talk to anyone. I've tried cutting down. I've tried just having some around so that I can have the odd spliff on a sunday or after a night out, which I'd like to do, but it doesn't work. If I have it, I smoke it continually until it's all gone. I meet all the criteria for a full on addiction, which I think I've known for years but have only just admitted to myself. It's strange because I've always told myself that I could just stop anytime and I believe I can stop any time. It's just that, despite all the negative consequences, I don't **want** to stop. 

I recently lost my job and for the last two weeks I have sat in my room and smooooooooooooooooooooooked. Nothing else. Two whole weeks and I've barely moved from my room. So I've decided that I'm going to stop. Permanently. I have a massive amount of changes happening in my life over the next few months and I'm going to take advantage of this to change lots of things that I don't like. I always used to try to introduce new activities into my life but failed because none of them were as fun as sitting with my laptop and a bag of weed for days on end. So now I'm going to try **not** to do some simple things that I hope will make it easier for more positive changes to happen:

1) I'm going to stop smoking full stop, not just weed.

2) I'm going to stop fapping.

3) I'm going to cut down on my internet use.

I think that these changes will hopefully remove the crutches that I've been using to make my dull life bearable, in the hope that it will give me the motivation to make my life full and interesting.

1343028884.0,16,self.leaves,x08tq,Almost 7 months in. No real difference noted. Thinking of going back?,martensen713,18,2,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/x08tq/almost_7_months_in_no_real_difference_noted/,"So the last time I smoked was January 1st, 2012. I had been thinking of quitting for the 2(ish) months leading up to that. After the 1st, my buddies went back to school, and I spent the next few days getting ready to do the same. I had no one to smoke with during those few days, and when I got back to school I was preoccupied with being a student-athlete (practicing, working out, etc.) so it kind of happened naturally and I didn't have to force it.

Let me note that the main reason I wanted to quit is that I am a student-athlete, and I have not been progressing in my athletics the way I had hoped when I first arrived at university two and a half years earlier. I decided last fall that something had to give. A lifestyle change was needed, and I needed to reorganize my priorities.

I had been smoking for 7 years at the time, since age 14, and a regular (multiple times daily) smoker for the last 5/6 years. I found that this was the most obvious thing I needed to change. I typically felt lazy and unmotivated. I would sleep in, slack on my to-do list, and basically get by doing the minimum. Obviously I felt there was a strong possibility that this was a by-product of getting baked all day.

So I cut down for a few weeks during November/December and tried cold turkey but it never lasted for more than a week. Finally, the aforementioned circumstances arose, which made it easy to follow through with my plan. After about two weeks I noticed I hadn't smoked in, well... two weeks. At that point it was all about keeping the streak alive.

Chances to smoke didn't go away, I have a few smoking buddies at school, but I found it was fairly easy to turn down those opportunities, given that I was fully committed to this change, and in sports you do what it takes to keep the streak alive. I found that relating it to a ""streak"" really helped.

I didn't notice a change after 1 month, which I heard is a typical length of time for a full flush of the system. I thought, ""well, maybe the fact that I've been such a heavy smoker means it could take a little while longer."" However, here I am, almost 7 full months into this, and I have yet to notice a day-to-day change in attitude. I have been performing well in my sport, but I would not say I have noticed a drastic change of any sort that can be related to smoking, or not smoking. I am still lazy, sleep in, put off menial tasks, etc.

I have been thinking about smoking more and more lately. I am quite sure I can prevent smoking from taking over as a priority, I would keep sessions to the end of the day when it wouldn't interfere with daily activities. I wouldn't be smoking before practices or workouts.

At the start of July I moved into an apartment with a friend who smokes about as much as I used to, and I know these temptations might be a result of being around it frequently again. However, I have never had anything against weed, I always enjoyed blazing, and quitting was essentially to find out what difference it would make.

As of right now, the only difference I have noticed is that I am not spending time searching for/buying/smoking weed. I still spend as much money, and eat just as much food on a weekly basis being a student-athlete, having to buy food on the road, and everything else that comes with that. Being an introvert, I am still as anti-social as I have always been.

My athletic career is top of my priority list right now, but I feel the positive strides I have made are as a result of spending more time at the field and at the gym. I feel I could maintain this level of play if I started smoking again, and I feel that a nice session at the end of the day could help keep me relaxed and focussed.

So that's my story. I feel that I would be able to start smoking again without changing my lifestyle, it doesn't seem to have changed at all anyway.

I am just looking for some input from some outsiders. 

I also would really like to know if there is anyone else who has quit for a similar duration, or longer, and noticed little to no effect in attitude with regards to daily life. 

Or, is there anyone who only noticed a change after a similar, or longer, period of time? I want to know if I should hold out hope for a change, or if there is essentially zero chance of change after the first month has passed.

Sorry for the long post, but any contributions and advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

**EDIT: TL;DR Quit to focus on athletics, smoking was too high on priority list. 7 months later, no day-to-day difference noticed. Temptation to smoke coming back, would like to start smoking again at the end of the day to unwind. Looking for others who may have noticed a longer duration before change, want to know if I should hold out.**

EDIT 2: Thanks for the replies, everyone. This discussion has been beneficial. 

Sorry it took me so long to reply... typical me, putting it off. 

Right now, for the record, I still have not smoked, the streak is alive. The plan is still to avoid smoking until, at the very least, my athletic career comes to an end. Whether that is a year from now, or 20 years from now, and whether or not I go back to smoking remains to be seen.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,1343624502.0,,,True,t3_x08tq,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/x08tq/almost_7_months_in_no_real_difference_noted/,

I don't really have emotions anymore. It's not that I'm sad, really. I just never feel any strong emotion. It freaks me out a little sometimes. can weed cause this?

I feel like a better person when I don't smoke for a while. In every regard, smarter, more energy, better socially.

Another reason is that... well as I said in the title I kind of hate the feeling of being high. My friends talk about what an amazing experience getting high is for them, but for me it feels good for 20-ish minutes, and then this feeling, I guess some people call it being ""burnt"" comes on, but I think it's worse for me than most. It feels like fog over my senses and in my head, it dulls every experience and makes it hard to think...

I started reading this book today and I can already see it's going to be very helpful to me, and I thought of you as well:
http://www.amazon.com/Attention-Revolution-Unlocking-Power-Focused/dp/0861712765

I got the recommendation from /r/meditation; there's a link to Meddit Book Recommendations on the side panel that I'm sure contains a treasure trove of gems. I thought I would share with you something I learned today.

Pretty early on, Wallace talks about the concept of *conation.* 

&gt; The term *conation* refers to our faculty of desire and volition. Conative balance, a crucial element of mental health, is expressed when our desires are conducive to our own and others' genuine happiness. Conative imbalances, on the other hand, are ways that our desires lead us away from mental health and into psychological distress. Such imbalances are threefold: conative deficit, conative hyperactivity, and conative dysfunction.

&gt; A conative deficit occurs when we experience apathy toward greater happiness and its causes. This apathy is normally accompanied by a lack of imagination and a kind of stagnation: we can't imagine feeling better than we do now, so we don't try to do anything about it. This robs us of the incentive to achieve greater mental wellbeing. 

&gt; Conative hyperactivity occurs when obsessive desires obscure the reality of the present. Fantasies about the future - unfulfilled desires - blind us to what is happening here and now. 

&gt; Finally, conative dysfunction is when we *do* desire things that are destructive to our own or others' well-being, and we *don't* desire the things that lead to genuine happiness for both ourselves and others. I include ""others"" here because we cannot cultivate optimal mental balance in isolation from others. We do not exist independently from others, so our well-being cannot arise independently of others either. To flourish individually, we must consider the well-being of those around us. As Buddha declared, ""One who loves himself will never harm another.""

&gt; The Indian Buddhist contemplative Shantideva comments on conative dysfunction this way: ""Those seeking to escape from suffering hasten right toward their own misery. And with the very desire for happiness, out of delusion they destroy their own well-being as if it were their enemy."" In Buddhism, misguided desires are called *craving*, which here means an attraction for something whose desirable qualities we exaggerate while ignoring any undesirable qualities. If our craving is strong, we see the very possibility of our own happiness as inherent to the object on which our mind is bent. This disempowers ourselves and empowers the object of our attraction. When reality breaks through our fantasies, disillusionment sets in. This in turn may lead to hostility and aversion, causing us to now project negative qualities upon the object we once craved.

This perspective really struck a chord with me. I think persistent use creates all of these imbalances. The key for me in quitting was adopting a completely different outlook on my life by reassessing my motivation to act the way I do. No longer do I see my life as misery to be merely endured. Instead, I see life is an interactive mystery, and it can always get better and better if we keep trying and learn to focus our attention!

Constantly turning to marijuana:

- Creates apathy by preventing us from imagining a better future or encouraging us to construct false logic for why things can't get better (or why things are just fine the way they are).

- Convinces us that we can be happy *alone*. This just isn't true. All of us need a highly social environment in which to test out our creations, and other people's reactions matter to us. We are inherently social creatures who experience enormous health benefits when we work for each other's well-being in conjunction with our own.

- Makes us prone to flights of fancy that never blossom with real work. We imagine utopia while failing to take any concrete steps to actualize it. We may blame others for the state of the world instead of asking how we can reasonably engage with it.

- Robs us of attention to the present. It hazes out what is happening in the present in our own lives in favor of focusing on all kinds of transitory and unimportant things that have no bearing on us: movies, memes, etc. We fail to notice the good things in our lives. 

- Shortens our overall attention span. It becomes impossible or at least torturous to do anything that requires persistence. It doesn't have to be that way. Masters of attentional focus can easily hold their attention on a single object for hours without their mind wavering or becoming discouraged. If we can work to achieve even a fraction of that, our lives will be markedly improved.

- Disempowers us from pursuing our dreams. When we think of an activity we would like to do, we immediately assess whether we would be able to smoke during or before the activity. If it seems impossible to do the activity high, then we convince ourselves we cannot do it at all. ""If I can't even go a day without smoking, how could I get that job? or how could I date that person? I can't, so it's not even worth trying."" This disempowering attitude helps no one! It's a self-fulfilling prophecy that leads to an incredibly unfulfilled life - filled only with *what if*s.

- Manifests consistent bodily tension. When it's been a while since the last hit, or when someone says or does something disagreeable, our body gets tense and our breathing becomes labored. We only end up completely relaxing and actually healing ourselves when we sleep. We must admit that consistently smoking makes us tense more often than at peace. It only seems peaceful because our mind becomes detached from the physical reality of our bodies. It is possible to use mindfulness alone to relax the body to the point of healing itself as though asleep throughout our waking hours. It just takes practice.

- Makes us lash out at people who try to guide us to the right path. We feel hostile and irritable whenever someone suggests we might do better for ourselves.

It doesn't do us any good to love or hate the things we crave. We must learn to love ourselves without condemning any emotion. We must open up to others and the ways that we all have a shared fate. We must learn to desire meaningful action for the reward of the pursuit, rather than acting out of fear or materialistic ambition. We must be clear with ourselves about why we take the action we do - and always focus on the fact that it can get better if we continue to practice nonjudgemental awareness of ourselves and the world around us. If you'd like more advice on focusing your attention in healthy and beneficial ways, I would definitely recommend this book.

Meaningful action should be easy. It only becomes hard when we sabotage our own progress by telling ourselves there's no need to try. When you try as hard as you can every day, and consciously give yourself permission and time to relax when you feel tense, every day will get better and better. Life is about learning to balance give and take. Keep experimenting and your progress will soon be evident! Never give up on love and gentle kindness, toward yourself and others.

When I first started smoking I had no problems with it. I would only do it once in a while, and never during the week when I had work to do. But since coming to college I have been constantly exposed to it and I've made most of my friends using it. Once me and all of my stoner friends started living together 2 years ago, weed has been what we are all about. We've had some great times and I don't think I'll look back at the times with a negative perception because I think life is too short to regret it, even some of the stupider things I've done.

I'm now about to graduate with a good degree from a good school, I have a job lined up, things in my life are seemingly in order. The only problem is... I have this lingering weed addiction. I have been able to quit over the course of 4 years, sometimes for a couple months at a time. A couple times I challenged myself to do it, and a couple times I needed to stop for other reasons. At the end of the day I always have come back to weed. I pretty much know that I need to quit, not necessarilly right now, but definitely by the time I start working this summer. I'll be moving to California so I know it will be easy to find, but I can't let my bad habit follow me into the real world. The part I'm struggling the most with: a lot of people want to quit so they can get back to their previous self and restore how they used to function before weed. My problem is I just don't really remember that phase/want it back. The last time I was really completely sober (no weed, alcohol, anything) was senior year of high school. Honestly, I wasn't very happy with my life then. I was too quiet, reserved, and serious for my age. I made it a point to branch out and chill out when I came to college, which led to smoking and partying in the first place. Now I'm conflicted because it has become such a big part of my life that I don't really have anything to fall back on. It seems like I might need to start from scratch, but I always run into roadblocks because I don't really know who I am without weed.

Towards the end I started not really taking care of myself, spending a lot of time zoning out, smoking weed, watching people play Super Smash Brothers. Anyway, at the end of April I felt an extreme sense of paranoia set in, and I didn't sleep for four or five nights. I took provigil (which keeps you awake), drank alcohol, and did whippets in close succession and that was it. I lost my mind. I stopped understanding what was happening, and I had to be hospitalized. In the hospital, I started hearing voices. They put me on heavy meds and I'm still being weaned off of them. I was hospitalized for three weeks and then my family took me home.

It started recreational, and turned habitual pretty fast. For the last 10 years I've been smoking daily and the longest break I've taken has been about a month.

I'm now 29 and feel like my social life has suffered the most from smoking. I've done a good job maintain my career and doing very well with it, but I hardly ever go out and find myself at my computer smoking pretty much all the time. 

I also live in CO and got myself a MMJ card and have been smoking the best shit around from dispensaries for the last two years. This past Saturday, my card expired and I have no intentions of renewing.

I guess I wanted to post here because I've tried several times to quit before, and always end up relapsing. Usually its either a friend getting me to smoke and that drives the habit back up again, or I just break down, get a joint, then a eighth, then all the sudden I'm right back where I started.

Obviously I'm not the only one with this problem, and wanted to post to hopefully get some positive encouragement to keep moving forward with it. Anyway, I'm very glad this subreddit exists and am hoping this time I can seriously quit for long enough for me to really evaluate my life and determine if pot really has been my problem all along or not. I'm fairly certain it is :) But, since the last time I wasn't smoking was when I was 19, I really have no idea what life is going to be like without smoking again at my adult age.

Anyway, I feel like with my source going away and by telling my friends that I'm quitting, I really think I can make it this time. The hardest part so far has been just filling the time that used to be filled with smoking. Every time I'm sitting at my computer doing my normal stuff, the though of smoking always comes to mind. I've dealt with the sleep problems and withdrawls before when trying to quit, but what always gets me back smoking is the comforting thought of relaxing and getting lost in whatever I'm doing. I'm basically never bored when I'm stoned, and now I'm nothing but. Ugh. Any advice on coping with this?

Mom and Dad met in AA meetings, though they both worked the GA/NA trifecta before all was said and done. Mom hooked up with a sadistic fuck of a human being, and from ages 6-10 I lived in what Family Services called ""torturous conditions"". Got placed with Dad, who stayed sober but still didn't know how to raise a kid. Lasted about three years there before he knocked my skull in and I ran away. Shuttled between homeless shelters and foster programs, ended up getting placed BACK with my Dad because no one really wanted to deal with me for long. (As you can imagine, I'd internalized a pretty strong dislike for authority and penchant for violence.)

Squeaked out of my teen years alive, despite persistent suicidal feelings. Decided all would be better once I managed to transition to living as a woman. (Oh, I'm transgendered. Did I mention that? Prolly should.) Realized that the money needed for transition and the likelihood of finding a job as a 6'+ woman with a five o'clock shadow didn't mesh, so spent about five years meandering from job to job and home to homelessness. In the process, fell off a roof and royally fucked my back, which was compounded by scoliosis the school docs had never caught and a cyst the size of a fist behind my abdominal wall that I had removed once, and grew back.

My best friend, who quite possibly had a life even more fucked up than my own, started smoking trees... all of a sudden, it was like he had come back alive. He didn't cry all the time, he actually wanted to do things, he LAUGHED again. I tried it, found the first relief I'd had since my back pain started. (With my family history, I always opted for ""deal with it"" rather than risk opioid dependency.)

I started working out again, got into the best shape of my life, and came to the realization that living as a freak happy in my own body probably beat hating the coward I saw in the mirror and wanting to kill myself, so I started transitioning anyway.

In the meantime, my best friend headed downhill - he'd sought psychiatric help and they told him that trees were the reason he was depressed, and he needed to stop smoking them and start taking their drugs. He went through a few hospital stays, and cycled through something like 18 medications over the course of three years. He decided to get a fresh start in a new state, and I went with him.

My hormones were off the charts (remember when puberty hit full swing? Yeah, something like that) and he was on and off so many meds that his side effects were nearly as bad as his symptoms. We argued, he kicked me out, I let him and cut ties. I built a new life from nothing. Again. Lost my car, found a partner, talked my way into a retail job and consistently outperformed anyone's expectations. All while smoking.

Got suicidally depressed earlier this year when I realized there probably wasn't going to be a time when my life became a ""normal"" woman's, and I'd probably always wonder if the people laughing when I went out were laughing at me. Spent some time in the hospital, quit smoking, started the doc's drugs. Ended up smoking after a month anyway, and back to business as usual.

Two weeks ago, my best friend (who had moved back home) drove to my state, bought a gun, and blew his head off in a park. Went home to find out he'd told everyone how ashamed he was of how things ended with us, and how he wished we could reconnect. I was one of his last friends that he pushed away, and to avoid portraying myself as a saint I said my own share of fucking hurtful things when I was feeling hurt myself. Since it happened, I alternate between autopilot, sleeping too much, smoking myself out of the reality of the situation, and uncontrollable sobbing/screaming. My whole life has been chaos, and the 15 years I knew him was longer than I'd had contact with anyone in my life including my own parents. We spent most of that 15 years seeing each other every day.

So now I haven't smoked for a week, because I'm out and I don't have the money for more anyway. I also don't have the money to see my doctor about my med levels, or my shrink about how fucked up I feel. I work 40 hours a week in a retail hell that makes me want to scream, and pay 20% of everything I make into an insurance policy that, with my shitty retail wage, I still can't afford to use. My back is agony, my cyst randomly abscesses and bleeds, and I'm still a 6'+ woman who questions every look people give me. I don't want to overstate my case for the Oppression Olympics, but the job market doesn't get any easier when you're an unprotected minority. I still want to kill myself.

I am so incredibly scared of following the same path he did, pushing people away and riding the pharmaceutical merry-go-round til I look for the fastest way out. I also don't like feeling like I'm carrying on the proud family tradition of addiction - but the ""haze"" is the only time I feel beautiful, the only time I feel worthwhile, the only time I stop thinking about why the fuck I should bother long enough to bother and do something.

Had been smoking daily for ~9 months. Girlfriend had no idea it was a daily thing for me. I avoided the truth and was in denial it was an issue until she brought it up as my smoking was becoming an issue, I told her how often I smoke and for the first time, admitted I have a problem. 

------------------------------------------------------

Hey guys,

I'm glad this subreddit exsist so I can get this off my chest I guess. 


I've been with my girl for a year and a half, I'm 22, been smoking since about 19, steadily increasing. About 9 months ago I secured my first fulltime job, so I was making rad bank so money to buy stopped becoming an issue and I always had it. 
Becuase I loved it and always had it, I'd smoke alot. It progressivly got worse up until a few months ago, I was almost preputally high, but not the high I loved, just a relaxed feeling, not necisarily a happy or fun feeling as my tolerance increased. I wasn't enjoying it like I should have been. 
My girlfriend mentioned she was worried that I was smoking more, and I was. I managed to cut out all morning and day tokes and kept it for when I got home of a night. I told her I had been cutting down. 


I recently revealed, kind of by accident that I smoke daily. This was news to my girl and she was very shocked to hear this, especially after me saying I had cut down. I hadn't told her how much I smoked. I avoided it, and only about close pals knew. My best mate doesn't even know the extent of it, he isn't a fan of it so I don't mention weed to him at all.  


She would sometimes have a smoke with me and I'd be great.. movies, awesome food and love making while high. Marvelous. She has no problem with it, but I always felt awkward smoking in front of her. Sometimes I'd try and sneak cones while she was in the shower or something and drink coffee/ clean teeth to cover it up. She knew, she could smell it but didn't want to make a deal out of it. It was pretty akward and embarrasing hearing this.


Most of out social events are parties or gigs. Over the last year I'd been smoking more  but I'd go out to my car in the street with my mates and hang out for a smoke, leaving her at the party by herself. 
With gigs, I'd do the same. Duck outside for a quick smoke in an alley or in the toilets.


I knew it was becoming a issue with my increased tolerance with my smoking every day, feeling guilty with my girlfriend even if she didn't say anything about it, my short term memory going to shit and my inability to stop voluntarily. 


I've wanted to bring it up with her, tell her I smoke daily and get some support. I didn't want to seem weak and thought it was a phase I could kick. Every bag I bought, I'd think ""this is the last one for a few weeks, i need a break"". 


Every week, I'd plan to have a few days off smoking, for my tolerance, health and to be able to say I don't smoke every day if I was asked (without lying).
And everytime I'd convince myself It's ok, I'll do it another day, or stop buying for a while after this one last bag. I'd tell myself things like ""ahh fuck it, I've been at work all day, I deserve a bit of a smoke to unwind and relax""


I've really wanted to take breaks but can't stay commited after a day at most and just fall back into it. I kept convincing myself it's something I could deal with myself and I didn't need to get anyone involved but at the same time I wanted to tell her about it but I was ashamed and afraid of being judged. 


My mate and I buy together, so he'd always let me know when he was getting some and If I wanted it. I kept saying yes, it was just effortless for me to acquire with my mate buying for me and having enough money to easily support my habit.



I have been smoking  a quarter a fortnight. to some that's not much.. just a few cones a day. 


So my girlfriend brought it up this week, mentioning a whole bunch of examples when I'd ditched her at parties etc, it was a somewhat supportive but rough email. It's what I needed. I read this with her over the phone, she was in tears. I ended up breaking down too and admiting I have a problem with it and needed help as I have poor self control with it. 
She was mostly hurt that I had kept this from her for so long. I could totally understand and felt terrible. I never meant for it to get out of hand like it has. I just wanted to enjoy my rise in income for a while but it ended up becoming a habit. 


Now that it's off my chest, I feel alot better that she knows now. I'm still in trouble for keeping from her, from a trust perspective but we'll work through that. Since that's the only thing I've kept hidden, I feel I can be more honest now and open.
I went through my room, found shitloads of empty baggies, home made paraphenalia, my bongs etc. threw it all out keeping just my remaining bud and dugout in a locked box. also now that she knows, I've said I'll definatly cut out daily smoking. I can't lie to her, I
m not a liar. This means I have no choice but to oblidge with myself and take it seriously. Alot of her friends and even some family have come close to  destroying relationships caused by our sweet leaf. I'm not going to be one of them, I would never forgive myself.


I'm not quitting, I just need a serious tolerance break, my mind needs a breathe of fresh air and clarity, from there I can see in hindsight how it was effecting me. Once I've let it out from my system I will smoke again, but with self discpline. Of course not every day or for the sake of it. I want it to be special to me again.


This is day 2. My sleep has been shit and I'm slightly irratable but it's something I can deal with. Although I would love a smoke, even just before bed, I'm going to hold off as much as I can and be strong. Knowingg that it will be there for me when I've got my shit sorted helps, gives me something to look forward to.. like that first time. It would be alot harder to deal with if I was straight up quitting.


Hey, thanks for reading. 

Best wishes to the rest of you.

1375946097.0,16,self.leaves,1jxxym,My Relationship With Cannabis,monetarydread,16,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1jxxym/my_relationship_with_cannabis/,"

I just had my fourth PM about my new relationship with Cannabis.  Yes, after thirteen-plus years of smoking daily, I have decided to quit.  Currently I am a month and a bit into my abstinence and the experience is more difficult than any day before . This has been something that I have been constantly thinking about for the last few months of my life because the relationship with the plant has changed from judicious use to being a hindrance.  I think that putting down my current thoughts on the subject could help both me and the other people who messaged about the why’s and how's of the subject.

The only way I know how to talk about my relationship with weed is to start from the beginning.  I am on the autism spectrum with a disorder called Aspergers syndrome.  I don’t want to focus on it too much, but basically you can sum it up as a social impairment disorder.  I am always awkward around other people, this lead me to feel nervous and self-conscious around others, that nervousness led me to being shy, and this combination of shyness and social impairment leads to others thinking that I am either awkward or creepy.  So think back to when you were in school, how would you have treated the kid who was akward or creepy?  I am fairly certain almost everyone would have treated me like every kid I actually went to school with.  I had few real friends, and the ones I did have tended to abandon me during school because they were embarrassed to be seen with me.  I was never invited to parties, and the only attention I ever received was negative. This all changed near the end of high school for me.  

I remember I was in grade 11 and I finally started to adapt to socializing.  I was still awkward as shit, but I met a group of friends that genuinely cared for me.  For the first time in my life I felt like I was a part of something, like I was a normal kid (Note: I did not know what I had until I was 24 because Aspergers was not recognised by doctors whenever I was tested for Autism).  I was happier than ever before, so I was accepting of the fact that they smoked Cannabis.  When I finally tried the stuff, I fell in love immediately. Despite all the down sides of smoking pot, the positives it brought to my life were immense for the time.  All of a sudden, I was able to make people laugh, my terrifying social anxiety had almost disappeared, and I was able to maintain a rapport with another human for the first time in my life.  To me, this has been one of the most important moments of my life, Cannabis has been a genuine help for me, and something that I will always be grateful for.  

Because the positive effects on Cannabis for me were so pronounced, my usage went from the weekends to every day.  By now, I was out of high school and working for a living.  So I could afford to make it a part of my life.  For years there was no problem with this approach; I would just buy a bag, smoke a pinch, and be done with it.  Yet my relationship with the herb was changing.  It was a slow change, at first I just didn’t get as high anymore; this was not a bad thing per-se, I actually prefer being baked to being stoned, but it was a change.  This led to me smoking more pot to the point where I was consuming around ten joints a day. 

 Eventually this abuse caught up with me and it started to affect the thing that made me voluntarily accept this drug in the first place.  I was becoming self-conscious about my ability to interact with others.  You see, when I am too stoned, I become fairly mute.  It is more difficult than normal to express my feelings, or share personal experiences with others.  At first I thought that was just my Aspergers getting in the way of my life, yet looking back with my current experience, I now know it was the weed interfering with my life because I think back to the times I was sober and there were no difficulties.  I was trapped in a vicious cycle though, the cannabis was making me more awkward than normal, then because I felt awkward, I rolled and smoked another joint whenever there was a pause in conversation.  Because of this, my use skyrocketed to never before seen levels.  I had to fight to make an ounce last two weeks, and when money was no concern I would smoke a bag in ten days or less.  
Somewhere along the way, socializing became too difficult, so I just abstained altogether.  I felt happier when I was alone, smoking pot, and playing video-games until the wee-hours of the morning.  I was content to continue down this path because, though I was not happy, I was content.  It was something that gave me a reason to get up in the morning, it gave me a reason to rush home with excitement, it gave me a reason to avoid all the difficulties I should have been fighting to fix. 

 This was the main reason why I quit, but really it wasn’t the only reason though.  There was the absurd cost of smoking as much weed as I was; $150 every payday equals $3600 a year.  That is a major amount of money to spend for someone who is constantly broke.  I felt slower than I should be, my focus was absent, I was struggling with my short-term memory, and integrating new experiences into my life were sacrificed because of my new character trait of extreme apathy. 

Now that I have quit, I am noticing just how much of a drug Cannabis really can be.  What I think is so dangerous about it is that it makes you okay with being bored, while at the same time feeling so insignificant in its effects that you are oblivious to what it is doing to you.  The first few days actually went by fairly easy, all things considered.  My brain was constantly asking me to refuel my exogenous cannabinoid stores (exogenous mean outside, I will get to why that is relevant in a minute).  This desire was all-encompassing, but workable.  I just gave away all my pot (almost a full ounce of the stuff) and paraphernalia (including my $300 vapourizer) to my friend Troy, then just removed myself from the world for a week.  I slept a total of eight hours that week, and I felt like shit because of it. Yet, that was the easy part of quitting.  


Warning, technical detail in the next paragraph (Correct me if I am wrong, I am going off of zero real research, just my memory from an intro psych class I took almost a decade ago)

You see, Cannabis works by flooding your brain with its own version of cannabinoids. The chemicals in pot are almost identical to ones that are produced in the brain.  They attach themselves to receptors called CBD 1 and CBD 2 then take over the receptors in a way that block the endogenous cannabinoids (the natural, or interior).  After a while the brain realizes that there is no need to produce the original chemicals anymore because there is an excess already present.  The purpose of the endogenous cannabinoids is to facilitate brain function by signaling specific parts of the brain to do its job properly, or they work to do the exact opposite and retard brain function when needed to make life becomes more tolerable.  They tell your body to release dopamine (important in the brain's reward system), they tell your body to release serotonin (the happy chemical), melatonin (the sleep chemical), or tryptophan (an amino acid that helps regulate hunger).  Cannabinoids allows you to stop thinking when trying to go to bed at night.  It allows to you stop obsessing over that girl that turned you down last Friday.  It allows you to sit down and enjoy a movie / TV show / game, etc.  

So after reading this, you see why quitting cannabis is tough for potheads.  Really, it is easy to quit in comparison to a drug like alcohol, which has physical addiction (makes  the act of abstaining for a week more difficult), but the tough part of quitting smoking weed is that the more you smoked, the longer it takes to get back to normal.  After six weeks my brain has not gone back to normal yet.  I cannot sleep properly.  I have these intense dreams that I have never experienced before (note: I have not had a dream that I remember in over a decade) I still feel emotionally weak in comparison to before I quit, and that weakness has been difficult to adjust to.  I am in a constant state of anxiety that makes all my worst fears unbearable to deal with.  My brain feels like it is operating at full speed at all times, and no matter how much I attempt meditation, I cannot obtain a clear state of mind.  Really, this is the hardest part of quitting.  Its the thoughts that come through.  I am not depressed, but the feeling of being overwhelmed by the emotions and past mistakes are crippling to me.  

You see, my biggest fear in life is that, despite me intense effort, that I will never be able to have a genuine connection with another human being.  That my thousands of hours of practice socializing will be for nothing, and I will be left to live life alone until I die.  It’s been thirty years of not having a girlfriend, and the people that I can truly call friend are so few that I can count them on one hand.  I know that these thoughts are not true, that I am just imagining the worst possible scenarios, and I really have progressed in these areas.  Hell, in the past couple of months I have shown myself that I can go into a bar, strike up a conversation with a group of people that I have never met before and hold a conversation for more than five minutes (something that I could not have done before).  I have met someone that I feel like I have a genuine rapport with, and although it is a woman who I am attracted to, she only sees me as a friend and I couldn’t care less about it because of that rapport (something that would have been impossible for me a few years ago). Despite this recognition in my abilities, I still have to deal with my brain sabotaging my thoughts, and this aspect is frustrating to me.  I know that my brain will recover in due time, and that science has shown that Cannabis causes no permanent brain damage, but the time of arrival cannot come fast enough.  I guess I just have to wait.

Day 2,Oatquit,19,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1jd2fa/quitting_day_2/,"In the last 10 years of my life, I have probably smoked weed on 95% of days.  Daily smoking started once I got my own room in second year of university and has mostly continued until now.  I rarely went to class, preferring to smoke and play WoW.  I failed out of engineering school twice, and barely managed to finish.  I know I missed out on lots of educational and social opportunities because of it.

In every job I've had, weed has held me back.  I've always found some way to do some 'work' from home or leave early and smoke.  I've often gone to work tired or groggy from staying up late and smoking.  My performance has always been 'acceptable' but I've never lived up to my potential.

A few months ago, I agreed with my wife that I would only smoke on weekends.  She has no problem with it but isn't really a smoker, and this was triggered by me asking her for help.  I feel weak and embarrassed that I need my wife to do this for me.  But I have not been honest with her, and I have been sneaking it.  I sneak by coming home early, or when she goes to the gym, or after she goes to bed.  It's very stressful, lying to the woman I love and hoping that the Visene's been doing its job and that my dry mouth isn't too obvious.  She deserves much better than that.

I recently found myself downsized and out of a job.  It's possible I would have avoided it by working harder and smarter (but maybe not).  Being at home all day has made things much worse.  I've smoked every day for over a month, usually wake and bake.   I've lied to just about everyone in my life about things I've done to further my job search.

I got rid of my stuff on Sunday.  I'm scared about how my brain is going to adjust after being constantly exposed for 10 years.  But I'm even more scared that with the weed gone, nothing is going to change.

No more worrying about getting a job opportunity that I would not be able to take at a moments notice, at least in theory.

Today also has brought me my first craving. It's a rainy sunday, and I was up early to get a work assignment done. After, I enjoyed a nice cup of coffee and cleaned up my apartment and got myself organized for the week. Now, this would be my absolutely favorite time to smoke. My works all done, my place is clean, and with it pouring outside there is nowhere I would be going. Today would be a day that I could, completely guilt free, smoke steadily throughout the day while catching up on Netflix, video games, a book, really anything. I know that I can do all of these things without weed, and it is still enjoyable. I just can't help but feel like something is missing. 

I deleted all of my contacts from the city I am currently living in so I am not really worried about me giving in. Even if i had a contact, I don't think that I would want to jeopardize the future goals of mine that require me to be weed free. Just more of a longing than anything else.

Leaves is a *support* group, and even if you disagree with someone you need to find a way to express it in a constructive and respectful fashion or not respond at all.

Last year, I struggled for months with a very unhealthy addiction to the legal marijuana/spice/incense/whatever. I got some good advice from here. Between that and a few weeks at my parents' house, I was able to quit.

In February or March,  I decided that I was doing so well (quit smoking cigarettes, too) I could handle a small bag of the legal. Famous last words, right?  Long story short, it took about a week to get back to my old, ridiculous smoking levels of 5+ grams a day, staying up or waking up at crazy hours to smoke one more spliff or bowl.

I've been hooked on this shit since then.  Almost all of my money goes to it. That won't be a problem, seeing as I'm currently dead broke.  I had to sell the ticket to the Black Sabbath concert I was going to see tonight so I can eat for the week.

Tough as it is, I'm going to try again. I flushed my last 2 bags today and have been reading /r/leaves for hours now.

And I'd also love feedback, really, of any kind.).

I don't get this shit.  Thinking about it now for some reason it's making me laugh, but I know in even just a few minutes I'll be depressed about it (I'm about 2/3's drunk and 1/3's high as I write this by the way...).  What the fuck is wrong with me?  I started smoking weed rough 2.5 years ago and it was great.  I'd get all my work done beforehand and all that.  Then I'd only smoke 1-2 hist *per week*.  I look back on those days with nostalgia thinking something along the lines of ""Man I really had my shit together then.""  

I'm not gonna pretend I'm *really* bad off.  I've lurked here a bit and know I've actually got a decently mild addiction.  I smoke an 8th every 1 or 2 weeks.  I know that's not a lot, and maybe even trivial compared to some here, but I dunno... I still know I'm addicted.  (Also I have a vape which helps cut down on consumption).  

But like I said, I still know I'm addicted.  I haven't had a sober day in probably 2 or 3 months except a few brief (2-3 day) stretches  here and there when I couldn't re-up.  And when I don't have weed I have a nasty habit of leaning on hard alcohol to stay not-sober.  I have better self control about alcohol (usually) but even now I'm drunk...  I've stolen my mom's vodka just so I don't have to be sober (and this isn't the first time). I rationalize this in two ways: 1) because my mom probably drinks a *little* too much anyway and I'm helping her out and, 2) because what-the-fuck-ever I told myself to get drunk at 6:30 PM.  

But it's so fucking stupid.  It's some ridiculous feedback loop that I don't understand.  Pretty much every time I'm high (either drunk, weed, LSD, whatev) I have this vision of myself.  This ideal person I want to be.  I can see myself as this great person who's accomplished so much through sheer determination and effort and who is proud of who he is and what his accomplishments are. A person who isn't necessarily sober, but who has absolute control over himself   and gets high from time-to-time as an 'added bonus' to life, not as ...whatever the fuck I do it for.  I can clearly see this person, and I say to myself ""God I want to be him.""  And when I'm high, nearly every time in fact, I resolve to become *him*,  to be  that man I want to be.  But it seems like I always make up some excuse (""Oh, I'm already high... I'll start later"", ""Oh, I'm already doing this thing, I'll start later"", etc).  And then when I'm sober... I dunno.  It seems like I want to be that person, but I also *really* want to be high for some reason.

Take two days ago for example.  I've had a really weird/messed up sleep schedule for the past month or two, partially due to the fact that I mostly smoke very late at night.  But in the past week or so I've managed to get back to a normal schedule.  So two days ago I wake up at 8:30 AM (which is really good for me) and think to myself (after I'd already resolved the night before to take a 2 week tolerance break for about the 10th time) and I think ""This is great!  I'm up early, I'm well rested, and I got high last night.  Time to do actual work.""  ...But of course 30 minutes later I was high.  And I can't even tell you why.  I think that's the worst part.  I had just gotten out of bed. I was having, by all accounts so far a very good day, and yet for some reason I said ""Fuck it, let's get high.""  Usually it's at least ""Oh it's 2AM and there's nothing to do.  May as well."".  But this was different.  

And I've experienced this weird feeling before.  This kind of 'being-high-is-nice-and-I-have-no-real-reason-not-to' feeling.  This, I think, is the feeling that let's me know I'm addicted.  This is that nagging voice in the back of my head when I'm sober and doing things that always says, ""If only you were high...then it'd be better"". This is the urge I know I need to fight but for whatever reason it seems like it's not gonna happen. Either because it's futile, because I convince myself it's pointless, or because I get high and forget about it.  

Anyway this kind of brings me back to my point:  It's fucking stupid.  Every time I 'try' to quit and fail I either convince myself that I didn't 'actually' try or that weed just isn't as bad for me as I make it out to be.  But I know I am addicted.  I feel like life is somehow 'less' without it.  And I feel like I have a pretty good grip on the world. I'm a scientist, I know how precious and amazing life is, I know how amazing being an intelligent, sentient being is, and I know life itself should be plenty reward for being alive.  But for some reason I just don't want to stop being not-sober.  And that's why I've run out of weed and resorted to stealing my mom's vodka.

Anyway, thanks for listening.  Like I said this is pretty much just a rant for myself but I thought maybe some people here might benefit and/or provide some nice feedback.

I stopped counting my days of sobriety.

Instead of focusing on racking up as many days of sobriety as I could, I completely let go of the strenuous effort of remaining weed free and weed in general by keeping busy the first week or so and completely placing weed outside of my life - mentally - all together. 

The more I harped on going longer without weed, the more I harped on how badly I wanted to smoke. I'd tally the days and find myself just staring at the tally marks with building urges. I basically needed an out of mind, out of sight approach. I just displaced any thought of weed all together whether it be smoking or avoiding it and before I knew it, my pothead friends had little to NO influence on me. I'd look up and realize that I hadn't smoked in 'several weeks' until I looked up and realized those several weeks had turned into a couple of months. 

It may not work for everyone, but hell - after 3 constant years of saying no and constantly giving in I can't believe I'm finally sober. 

The kicker is that I dabble in the distribution of mary as well. 
I saw it ONLY through the perspective of it being a ""job"" and not a damn thing otherwise. Now my friends come over and knock out rillos and bowls and I do nothing but think of how fucking difficult it was to finally be where I am now and never get an ounce of urges to partake further.

I hope this can help anyone else that was in mine and many others situation.

I tried to keep this concise, however it's still a long post.  Sorry.

I smoked for the first time at age 16.  I was a nerdy misfit who sought out cannabis after a friend showed me The Union.  I grew up in a home with 2 parents that have chronic OCD.  I was living in a state of constant anxiety and depression my entire life.  From my first hit, I was in love.  The calm and pure happiness the drug brought me nearly brought me to tears.  I started smoking with friends twice a week throughout most of my Junior and Senior year.  It was never enough.  My senior year, my girlfriend bought me my mflb.  

The little wooden box quickly started to destroy my life.  A quick toke before school was fun.  But then the box came with me in my pocket everywhere; rehearsals, school, etc.  I was extremely excited about having any reputation whatsoever.  I was the token stoner kid.  My life wasn't a joke to people.  I made new friends through pot (a big deal since I had crippling social anxiety).  The summer after my senior year was the best summer of my life, cruising around with my buddies and hotboxing cars.  I was part of a group and completely comfortable in my own skin.  It was a weird feeling at first, but I grew to realize that this feeling was confidence.

I went on to start my freshman year of college and all of my progress vanished.  I was afraid of meeting new people and sat in my room vaping the days away.  I stuck to a small group of some guys I knew from high school.  Leaving my dorm room to smoke with them was what I considered a social life.  I don't even want to think about the money I blew just in the first semester.  I decided to rush a fraternity in the spring to branch out my social circle and not have to smoke off my loneliness.  I didn't get in.  From there my anxiety and depression were back in full swing, complete with suicidal thoughts I hadn't encountered since I was 11/12.  I even started to fuck up at the one thing about school I liked, my job.

I got home for the summer two weeks ago.  I kept smoking.  I didn't hit up any of my old friends.  I was afraid to talk to people.  I held myself prisoner in my own house, basically.  I vaped through a half ounce and just ran out Saturday.  I decided not to reup and get my life back in order.  My first day was tough.  I spent the day angry and randomly crying.  I would look in the mirror and hear myself saying aloud ""I want to fucking kill myself"" ""Just fucking die"" etc.  I caved into my emotions and ate a gram of AVB before bed.  I wasn't happy about it but I didn't feel to guilty about it either.  The next two days of actual quitting went somewhat better.  I was very jittery and irate, however I pushed myself to go to the gym and work through it.  

Day 3 started about an hour ago. I'm starting to feel better than I have been.  But I realize that now I must push myself to deal with the issues that I have been masking with weed for the past 3 years. Not sure how to go about that.  I find myself to be a very introspective person and can usually talk myself through my issues, yet it is definitely time to find a therapist to talk to.  I'm not sure about how exactly to go down that path, however I will ask around for recommendations on a good therapist.  In the meantime, I fear that I may not like what I learn about myself while having a clear head.

My mother also is a heavy smoker. I go over to her place usually once or twice a week, and we'll smoke and hang out for a while. I work full time at a pizza place and EVERY single person I work with smokes. When the boss leaves, people start rolling blunts and break out their pipes. I work with some very nice people, who offer to smoke me out all the time. Everywhere I go, weed is around me.

I'm going to try and quit for 3 months, but it'll be hard when everybody I hang out with constantly smokes. I think I can do it, but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

I know this is coming at the right time. As a young college student, I needed a punch from reality so I could realize I'm not invincible. Nobody gets caught, ha. Gamble the dice thousands of times, and many possibilities of fate will occur. It was bound to happen. 

Weed had taken over every facet of my life. I was smoking everyday I was smoking to avoid sobriety. Getting high took priority over schoolwork, watching my old favorite shows, and my social life. Girls texted me and I pushed them away. 

Is the law fair in my mind? Not necessarily, but it was needed. I'm taking this as a terrible wake-up call. Handcuffs, mugshots, and a jail cell are fucking hard punches thrown by reality.

Used it at first for fun, then realized it made me a calm individual and felt free of anxiety.  I wasn't a heavy user by any means.  Only in the evenings and used a vape most of the time (really helps reduce consumption).  All in all I probably averaged 1/8-1/4oz on a monthly basis, so it's nowhere near what most consume.  However I've always felt sensitive to this stuff.  It was strange because it would sometimes bring out anxiety in me when I would vape, but the benefit was I was much more calm when sober.  It just worked.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago.  I started getting panic attacks when vaping/smoking.  I had to stop.  For what it's worth, I was (and have been) under a good amount of stress, so that was probably part of the problem.  Regardless I knew it was time to stop as I had been masking an underlying problem for awhile now and needed to cope with the stress in a natural way.

The first week was absolute hell.  I wasn't prepared for it because I didn't even think about withdrawal symptoms.  I figured I was a light user, didn't think of the fact that daily use (regardless of the amount) will rewire the brain to some extent.  Symptoms I've experienced:

* Anxiety and anxiety attacks
* Tinnitus (most frustrating at times)
* Insomnia 
* Loss of appetite
* Depression, but mostly a feeling of unease, what you experience when going through a big change in life

At this point (11-12 days since last consumed) the anxiety is somewhat under control.  Dealing with random anxiety spikes that can come out of nowhere and have no relation to the current situation.  The insomnia now is only in effect when the tinnitus gets bad (hard to sleep with that constant noise).  Appetite is back fortunately and I'm starting to feel normal.

Felt the need to share because I'm sure we can all agree, seeing a similarity in symptoms helps keep our minds at ease so we don't feel we're going crazy.  Drinking a lot of tea (caffeine-free), getting proper rest (going to bed early, not staying up late), good food, and overall mindfulness has kept me sane.  

Just wanted to share, but does anyone have tips on the tinnitus aspect of symptoms?  It's the one thing that has been driving me crazy.  With that aside I can sleep peacefully throughout the night.

I've had zero cravings since I stopped, that's the positive in all of this mess.  I just hope to be back to normal soon and continue the detox.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1ct8h0,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1ct8h0/daily_consumer_now_nearly_2_weeks_clean/,

It still feels cool to talk about it even though it's dangerous and stupid. 


I'm really proud of myself today because i've been really tempted to smoke recently. I hung out with a new friend who asked me where to get some weed yesterday (I used to hook him up) and i said that i couldnt help him. Today after a work meeting about 6 guys were gonna go back to a friends house and smoke and while i really wanted to spend time with them, but i knew that i would be tempted so i decided not to go. While its a bummer to not spend time with them, it's a success in my book. i was able to resist the urge and the peer pressure and show resilience in the face of a STRONG desire to go and smoke.


for all of you trying to leave weed, commit to it. you are a person who does not need weed to relax at the end of the day, to blow off steam after a hard day, or socialize with friends. We need those unhappy moments to grow and to help identify what needs to change. If those moments are just numbed with weed we will be complacent in our unhappy lives.


good luck to all my fellow leaves - like i said, i never EVER imagined I would be sober for 60 days.

I am an ent of r/trees, and i recently got caught by my dad. He wasn't pissed like i though he would be, he was primarily disappointed. I could tell that he was really sincere in what he was saying, but i can't help but to call bs on certain things... Idk. 

I go to college, i work out, i work, i have a girlfriend, i have awesome friends (those who do and do not smoke), and i have my head on straight for the most part. I just can't help thinking that the only reason for his disappointment was that its illegal. I didn't wanna disrespect him by arguing and saying what he would think if it was legal, but i really wanted to ask him that. His main concerns were that it is a roadblock for future opportunity. I could get drug-tested, or i could get caught by the police. Which would be bad, considering i want to be a state trooper. 

Everyone gives me shit about that last thing. I smoke weed, i wanna be a cop. In my view, weed provides me to examine everything and anything in the highest degree. I see myself and my actions more clearly, as well as the affects it has on myself and other people. I truly think that it has helped me with my relationship with my girlfriend, with my family, and with God. It helps me relax after a rough day, and i love socializing with fellow ents! 

And yet i am considering stopping, just because everyone says i should. But how can i stop something i truly believe to be good? Should i not follow my heart and do what right? Or should i take this advice and stop because i can't see the big picture? Life is hard. And i didn't want too much bias on the side of weed so that why i didn't post this on r/trees.

Been smoking weed since I was a High School freshman. I am now 22, so that's about 7 years of getting high. In my Sophomore/Junior year of HS, I really started getting down, getting stoned before classes, stoned before everything, really. It didn't feel limiting academically or socially. When I went to a University, I studied Physics for a few years and did fairly well, as a regular smoker of copious amounts of marijuana. Eventually, I started to feel shitty in college. Some things hadn't gone my way, and I continued to smoke copious amounts of pot, yet the peripheral negatives started to make an appearance. I feel I have drifted from countless friends, I am forgetful, I miss classes, I fall asleep intermittently at inopportune moments – I make STUPID MISTAKES. 

Essentially, at age 22, although I am passionate about what I do with my work, and things aren't 'terrible,' I feel my youth and vivacity is slipping away, and getting high is accelerating this process. I want a lovely girlfriend, this feels more difficult now than it ever did. I never had problems getting girls. I want to read more, do more, learn more. I feel I am at a plateau, I am stagnating. I'm becoming a loser to that wide-eyed inner-child sitting in the back of my mind, whom is bearing witness to the decrepitude of his host. I want to be a better man, a better son, a better denizen of the planet, and right now I feel like a total shithead.

But I just can't. Do this anymore. I just can't. I have other things I want to be spending my time on. It doesn't mean that I want to stop forever, but... like I want to put it to the side for now. Let me take some time to get my shit back together, to get my life in order. I've grown up, I have a job that I need to focus on, I want to have kids soon... There are things I have to get back on track with and things I want to learn and enjoy before I settle down and start this new life I'm working so hard to prepare for. 

There is an imbalance, and I need to balance it for my own sake, because I deserve it. I deserve that from myself. I've given myself 9 awesome years of stonerrific fun times, but now it's time to get real, grow up, and be honest with myself, and admit that I need sober time. I need time to THINK. To Plan. To work hard on bettering myself. 

If and when I feel my life is balanced a bit more equally, maybe I will make the decision to allow myself to enjoy a small smoke on a nice hike, or when out on a stroll. But I never want to be where I am now, ever again. And I hope that knowing that, will help me make the right decision at that time. 

It's only rational when you think about it. How many years have I spent doing this one thing? Now how about putting that to the side and devoting some time to something more positive? When you think of it like that, it really seems quite the right thing to do. I mean, why not? I want to be better. Why am I holding myself back? I think it's because I'm scared, and being immature/dishonest with myself.

I don't really know why I'm writing this. I guess I just wanted to share with people who may understand. I *want* to stop.

I figured since there's probably a bunch of people here having troubles finding something to do in lieu of trees, we should talk about some of our favourite alternative ways to spend time, particularly online.

I've been interested in the 'science' of mnemonics for a while, so my project has been trying to further develop that skill set; not only is it a distraction from trees, but it's also a good way to exercise those recovering brain cells :) There's a really good book out there for anyone whose interested called ""Moonwalking with Einstein"" and an online community at http://www.mnemotechnics.org.

",PrettyPleaseMe,15,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/167si4/time_for_me_to_grow_up/,"I just turned 18, and that is truly terrifying for me. It just recently hit me I am an adult now and need to start acting more like one. I have been smoking semi-consistently for about 2 and a half years now and I think it's time for me to stop. I love(d) weed but it's not for me anymore. Three years ago I was totally against weed, and even stopped associating with my best friends because they had started smoking. I was brainwashed by our culture and know now that weed is not inherently evil. When I finally did overcome my ignorance and tried smoking weed I always said, ""It will be something I do, not something I am."" I held true to this for awhile, and didn't even own a piece for about a year.

But slowly I started using more and more, and talking about it more and more until weed became a part of who I was. It is/was a large majority of what my friends and I talk about. One day I remembered when I used to say ""Man, I hate those people that only talk about weed. If I ever start smoking I'm not going to be one of them."" When I remembered this I brushed it aside and came up with some excuse like ""well, I said that back before I tried weed so I didn't know what I was saying"" or some bullshit like that. But now I've become someone I've never wanted to be, a ""pothead."" Now don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with smoking weed a lot, it's just not who I want to be. People associate me with weed, even people I hardly talk to, if at all. I can't blame them though as I smoked weed all the time. I've been working at a new job as a busboy and I have made over $1000 working  for only a few months while still attending highschool. More than half, if not two thirds, of that money has been spent on weed alone. This past month I spent $160 in one week on weed. While that may seem trivial to a lot people, it's about a tenth of all the money I've earned. 

Weed has also made me less smart. I'm still clever and quick on my feet, but I have a harder time remembering things when I used to be able to read things once and almost be able to recite it word for word. I used to be able to remember things in striking detail and could bring up pages of books in my head to remember what was written on them. I'm not saying I had photographic memory or anything close to it, but my memory was most definitely better. I was definitely smarter before weed. I also used to be a better athlete, captain of the lacrosse team freshman year, ran track, and did judo. Now, I do none of those things. I'm not saying weed has ruined me, I'm saying that I allowed myself to become a lesser of a person and I was using weed as an excuse. Why go out and run when I can get high and watch netflix? 

Weed is just like anything else, in moderation it may be fine but in excess it is detrimental. However, I can not do moderation, I've tried and it doesn't work. So last week when I was dry and my dealer let me know he was good, I decided that I wasn't going to buy anymore and I was quitting cold turkey. With that, it's been 5 days since the last time I've smoked. Do I feel any different? No. Do I think I will? Not really. But I am proud of myself. Last night I found one of my pieces that I had misplaced, and it was still full. My god was that tempting. I was about to light it up, thinking okay one last bowl, then I'm done for good. Finish with a bang. That was until I saw this post on /r/trees http://imgur.com/a/mNDXo I read that post six times. Dumped out my bowl and smiled. 

I'm done with weed. Forever? Who knows but definitely for a long time. Thanks for reading my story. Sorry it's so long, didn't realize I had so much to say until I started writing.

Been flirting hardcore with the idea of having a smoke because, who gives a damn.  I'm doing what I'd do stoned anyway, without the fun of being stoned.  

But a quiet part of me knows I've made progress.  That I'm an addict and I can't just smoke once, or for a week.  And that I've made real social gains that I can forget about if I'm not careful.  I get on with the few friends a little better, I interact on reddit, I have a real relationship with my dad now, I hang out with my 3 year old nephew and I'm not stoned.

THis is my first time stumbling upon this subreddit. I've been pretty much an everyday smoker for 4 years-ish now. Basically since Sophmore year of college (graduated this past may). Trees have made such a huge impact on my life. It really started with all my best friends from high school, whom I am all still really close with even though we live 3 hours away. It also is ingrained deeply in my life. I'm a huge music/ live concert person and I go to tons of festivals and shows. What happens here the most? obviously people smoke. ALL my friends pretty much smoke. It has no negative effect that I can see on any of them, nor me. I now have moved out, have my own apt, and have a really good job for just having graduated recently. ALL while smoking, (stopping for drug tests for jobs). Then I starting dating this girl last year who is really really conservative. Her roomates were all friends with us and both her roomates smoked all the time with us, but she never did. NEver seemed to be a problem. Then one of her roomates when crazy/ lost her mind (literally hospitalized, couldnt remember her name) and the gf attributed it to smoking.  (maybe, but I  dont think so. fyi the girl is pretty normal now and in grad school) This pretty much alienated her to trees forever. ANYWAY. WHen we started dating I knew she hated smoking, and she still has the mentality that it is a really bad drug, like cocaine. She doesn't understand, never will. And she would never smoke. She KNEW i smoked before though. yet this was all fine. We had an agreement 't that I wouldnt smoke ever when around her. which is FINE. we pretty much dont talk about it. I still smoke a lot, but I dont see her very often now that we graduated and she is in school far away and I have a job. we still see each other usually once a week or once every 2 weeks. Anyway... yeah so idk. I told her I didnt smoke really at all anymore, although I do, but didnt tell her that I stopped completely. because I didnt want to stop completely, and she wanted me to, but I know its almost impossible. all my best friends do. my brothers and sisters do occasionally. How can I just be the only one not to smoke when everyone in social situations is? So the gf would ask sometimes if I smoked x day or tell me not to smoke if I was going away with friends for a weekend to a show or something. but I have little willpower, and would cave, but I would let her know. Yeah i smoked. so then all of a sudden she calls me the other day bawling and just saying she needs to find herself, and her morals, and that we need to break up. im just so lost at this point in my life. i am totally in love with this girl and I really was thinking long term. she said she still loves me too and knows I would do anything for her but this has to happen. trees is not the only reason she is feeling lost and confused but I know its a big part even if she doesn't admit it. so I am at a crossroads. what do I do. I've convinced her to stop by tomorrow to talk (like I said she lives 3 hrs away). I know what I need to do. I need to fully commit to quitting for good, and letting her know that I can really do it. Its just so hard because I can't change my beliefs. I will never be able to THINK its a bad drug, and thats how she sees it. I think after the election tuesday and I was talking about Colorado leaglizing and how its such a good thing for America, i think that really scared her too. idk. i dont know what I am looking to get out of this post but I guess I just needed somewhere to vent. These past 2 days have been fucking horrible. I am miserable, can barely hold back the tears, and dont even know wha to do with myself. I feel completely isolated, living by myself in a city with really not many close friends I can talk to. but then I feel like shit and smoke a vape or a bowl and I feel a lot better. its fucking tormenting me. sorry for this long and probably unreadable post. im not in the best place right now. idk. somebody please help me.

Normally I would eat a brownie right before the ceremony started, so by the time the wedding and most of the group shots are done I'm blazed.  

I gave away all my herb and hardware last Monday so I was feeling really proud of myself showing up sober.  It was a really small ceremony and at the last minute the bride asked if I could shoot video.  Normally I don't do video, but the request was simple enough so I thought I could make some extra money by adding on a DVD to the package.  

BAD IDEA.  Long story short, there is no video.  I think my assistant turned the recording off thinking that the video wasn't already going.  It was a miscommunication, and I was pretty stressed going in because I didn't have as much time with the bride as I would normally like, so it doesn't surprise me that something like this would happen.  I usually have a lot of anxiety that something like this will happen leading up to a wedding, so I smoke to calm my nerves.  It's funny that my first big fuck up at a job like this happened when I was sober.  

The photos turned out fine, so it wasn't a total disaster but the weekend was one long panic attack. I just left a message for the father of the bride, and the anticipation of his returned call is killing me.  Not much I can do about it now except to vent here.  

Wouldn't it be funny if I told him that normally I show up to these jobs stoned, and since this was my first sober job I wasn't in the right state of mind???  Do you think he'd understand?:)

My sobriety came unwanted, I was busted by a random at work decided to come clean and change my ways. Since the pay is good and losing my job is not something I would want to do during this economy. I was forced to go through an 8 week IOP in order to prove that I was sober. The program was a breeze and honestly i felt that life was getting better, but recently I've felt more miserable. I would be lying to say that I haven't considered changing jobs just so I can be reunited with my precious, but I have too much riding on me at work and it would affect too many people. Work was nice enough to let me retain my position, but i feel that I am slowly dying inside. 

Everyday I walk into work I despise being there, but the fact that my family depends on me working keeps me there. I've stayed away from concerts and other social events where smoking is around because the scent of the sweet cheeba drives me fucking insane.

Usually, I'd just take 1 big hit out of a bowl several times a day to keep me flying.

I've tried numerous times to quit, and the last time was 14 days clean but then I was bored and feeling low that I gave in and bought a quarter and I really regret that.  I could be 2 months clean by now but I guess it was a slip up.  This time I really can't smoke because of money issues.



I've been unemployed for months now, and I have to get a job.  Knowing that the field I'm in I will be drug tested, this has been my main motivation to stop smoking weed.  During the first week or so it was rough.  I was really depressed and could not get out of bed.  For some odd reason, weed gave me motivation because I could do mundane tasks because my mind would be somewhere else drifting while my body sort of operated on autopilot.

The second week, I still feel down pretty down and I'm oversleeping and in my dreams I'm with friends and it's always some party situation where everyone is smoking weed and I'm just part of the crowd smoking with them, but I always regret it and kick myself asking why I just smoked.  This is in the dreams, not real life.  I'm still pretty depressed each day, I try to exercise and ride my bike and slowly try to do things I used to do high but now do them sober.  It's not easy.

So, now I'm on my third week, and lately I'm still having weird vivid dreams and sometimes I smoke in them but now it doesn't carry the same regret.  I honestly do not have a strong urge to smoke when I'm awake, I just wish I didn't feel so depressed and isolated because my social circle and weed were basically the same thing.  Essentially, I am by myself almost everyday, which leads to boredom, which leads to you know what.

I'm 5'11 and weigh about 140lbs, so I'm a skinny guy and I exercise mainly to try to get the weed out of my system for a drug test.  I'm still unsure if after 23 days its ok to start applying for jobs since I don't know if I'll pass or fail a drug test.

I don't really have much of a desire to smoke weed, but I will admit the hardest thing is trying to figure out what to do with myself and how I go about making new friends because my whole previous group of friends are all major stoners.  I started volunteering at a food bank so that's something, but I really just have difficulty dealing with the isolation and depression, which in the past weed used to be my medicine but it can't be that anymore.  Now, I look forward mostly to sleeping because my dreams are awesome, sleep itself is almost like a drug because the dreams are so intense and powerful, as opposed to my real life which has become dreary and lacking direction.

I hope each day that I can get out of this depressed state and try to get a job soon and get on the right track because weed really just makes your head swirl around with thoughts that don't make much sense, but it seems like entertainment when you are high in a way.

The first time I ever smoke was Summer 2003, right before I started high school. I was 14. I smoked quite a bit until I move to where I currently live. I live here for about a year before I ever smoked again. When I was 17 is when it became an every day habit. I smoked just about every day for six years. I was constantly around it so I figured, 'why not?' Well, years past and I grew up and got married and became a mom and it just didn't seem worth it anymore. I've always had a love/hate relationship with smoking but after three days of not having it (because I couldn't find any) I said enough is enough. I recently lost my job and wanted to find a decent one making over minimum wage and quitting smoking would play a big role in that. But it wasn't until two weeks after losing my job that I finally quit. I've never felt so relieved. I really feel like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I don't feel like I have a crutch anymore. I always made excuses for why I should smoke (had a bad day a work, bored, I'm annoyed and have anxious, and so on) but now I'm finding other ways to deal with these problems. It's been easy so far but I know it will get hard. But I'm happy knowing I have support for people that care and are going through the same things I am when it comes to quitting. I know in the end it's going to make things better and that's what matters most.

Every time I have the opportunity to smoke now (which has been three times since I quit) I just remind myself that I've come this far. Why fuck it up now. It's just not worth it anymore.

Strangely enough, I don't really feel any different. I had been smoking so much for so long that it I think it was hard for any amount to really make an impact. My wallet noticed though. It's also motivated me to stop smoking cigarettes, which is my next goal.

This is a familiar feeling... like I'll never have fun again, like I have been robbed of all enjoyment in the world.  I keep thinking ""I can never smoke again... oh... god..."".  I had the same kind of feeling when I quit smoking cigarettes and the last time I quit smoking pot (lasted two weeks).  But the last two times I quit smoking pot, the idea was to reduce to weekends after my hiatus.  Never happened though, always came back smoking twice as much.

Well, here goes.  I have no motivation to do anything productive today, knowing that I won't be able to simply push a happy-button to reward myself.  It took me about a week last time before I could start enjoying being productive like I could with the weed.

Thanks for listening.

**Day 2** I feel a little bit crisper waking up this morning.  I'm halfway out of the fog.  There's a little sensation of excitement growing inside of me, like the suppression of a giggle.  At the same time, I feel a little pressure, kind of like a hangover... external sensations are sharper and attack a bit more... probably just an effect of coming out of the fog, losing my numbness. 

**Day 3** Today's not so great.  I keep having that compulsion to light one up.  I'm currently working on a publishing a paper, and I keep imagining how nice it would be to sit down, roast one up, and work on it.  Then I completely lose motivation to do it once I remember quitting.  I'm not even considering giving in, but I don't feel motivated or creative anymore.  I just want to sit in front of the TV and be spoon-fed faulty information.

**Day 4** still kind of the same as day 3.  My cannabinoid system is re-establishing itself, I suppose.  I haven't been very productive at all today... just not into it, don't have my motivation-in-a-bag.  Staying on the wagon; I know this part usually takes a couple days to get through.

**Day 6** I went and jammed with some friends tonight, as I do every night.  One of them smokes pot every time, I usually partake.  Not this time.  Wasn't even really tempted.  But I still have this sharp feeling that started on Day 2.  Everything's a little more intense, in an annoying way.

**Day 7** Woke up to my first dream in a long time today.  More like nightmare.  This tall skinny dude with an orange Hellboy-like face (and his two friends) were trying to beat me down.  They were just some thugs squatting in a house that was being fumigated near my hometown house, but this crazy coke-head that I happened to be with (no idea where he came from, he was just always there) acted all weird and crazy and freaked them out and they kind of receded back into the darkness.

I've told myself for the last year now im going to ""stop smoking"" only to resume within a week easy, each time. It gets to the point where im scraping the black shit out of my bong to get a hit and i just feel terrible about myself. /r/leaves, what are some tips on really plucking weed from the thought patterns, as this seems to be the central cause of the relapse(even thinking about quitting weed is still thinking about weed, and thats all ive done all day). When i dont have money i get that i cant smoke and im at least content passing the time normally, but as soon as i get paid, you better believe within a day or 2 im buying.

I just want to stress the importance of diet when trying to quit. Many people that seem to be addicted to weed are covering up the bad effects/feelings of a terrible diet.  We are not meant to be going on blood sugar rollercoasters every day. Sugar/simple carbohydrates digest too rapidly and send you up and down. Simple carbs are mainly in processed foods, like white bread, white rice, etc.  We aren't adapted to always consuming fast digesting foods, but when you eat them all the time your body gets so used to them that you can also have withdrawals when you switch to non processed, slow digesting foods. Same with caffeine.  If you seem to have crazy emotional swings when you quit smoking and feel like you need weed to be normal then look at your diet. Start a log at least, write down everything you eat, the time, and the mood you are in.  Look at the relation.

This worked for me. I got my own blood sugar monitor and figured out that my blood sugar was going up rapidly to 180-190 after a typical meal that I ate and then dropping to around 60 very quickly. Some will say 60 is nothing to worry about, but I continously linked feeling horrible to the rapid drop in blood sugar with my blood sugar monitor.  I eliminated all sugar and simple carbs from my diet and switched from drinking coffee to green tea and now I feel great. I also got a whole food multivitamin that I take every day.  

You might have been raised on a similar diet. I was. It's hard to make the link when you don't know what it feels like to eat a good unprocessed delicious diet.  You may also have a problem with milk or wheat and not be aware. I didn't buy into it for a long time after I eliminated simple carbs but I decided to eliminate whole wheat as well and I felt even better. When I reintroduced wheat I broke out in hives. I tried reintroducing wheat 3 times with the same results.  I don't think wheat is bad. I think the way it's grown now is.

Anyways, it's difficult, but please try it. The typical diet now promotes metabolic disorders like Insulin Resistance or Reactive Hypoglycemia.... or diabetes. I was actually diagnosed with Reactive Hypoglycemia. I don't think it's really a ""disorder"" or a problem, but it's usually caused by too many simple sugars, carbs, caffeine, and possibly too much tobacco. All of these things raise your blood sugar rapidly causing it to crash back down again and again. Your brain suffers the most from this.   

Eliminate processed foods and caffeine from your diet, eat meats, veggies, complex carbs like brown rice, potatoes. Exercise 20 minutes twice a week, take a whole food multivitamin and get 20 minutes of sun a day on most of your body. I made these changes and now I can go without smoking for any length of time without losing function, without having wild mood swings, etc. 

Here are the symptoms of food-induced reactive hypoglycemia from wikipedia.

* I've found that as the last week or so has gone by, I've been less occupied with the idea of quitting. It's become a more natural path, without a conscious effort every moment of every day.

* I'm no longer finding myself tempted to text a mate to 'catch up'. On the way home from work I don't find myself considering heading out to a friends house to hopefully sit in on a smoke session. Needless to say, one of my most toxic friendships has taken a beating, but I know full well it's for the better.

* Clarity is becoming the norm, and the days of trying to function through a haze are gone. Waking up with a clear head is damn good, and I'm even finding it easier to get out of bed, although I still love sleeping in. Conversely, its a bit harder to sleep deeply - I wake up once or twice during the night, but it's not an issue. 

* Dreams.
Dreams dreams dreams. Enough said.

Hope everyone out there is doing well, and as I've found, it's only getting easier as days roll by.

The loneliness and shame we feel seems to a consequence of this struggle and yet, clearly we are not alone and this battle does not define our character.  I have no advice on the subject outside of what has already been written (exercise, self-compassion, distraction) but I do know that is much easier to do it with support.  

I thought I would include the STORY OF THE LOTUS EATERS as it is printed in the front of the Marijuana Anonymous text.  Even if the 12-step tradition doesn't fit for you, I hope some part of this may be helpful:

""About 3000 years ago, the poet Homer told a story about a man called Odysseus and his voyage home to Greece following the Trojan Wars.  Odysseus and his men met up with many exciting adventures along the way, but the most relevant to us is the story of his landing on the Island of the Lotus Eaters.

""The island was so beautiful that Odysseus wanted to stay there awhile and rest up.  So he sent out some scouts to determine if the natives were friendly.  Odysseus waited and waited, but the scouts never returned.

""What had happened was this: the scouts had indeed met up with the locals, the Lotus Eaters, who turned out to be very friendly.  The Lotus Eaters even shared their food with the scouts.  But the food - the lotus - was a kind of dope, and the scouts got wasted from it and forgot all about Odysseus, their mission, getting back to Greece...everything.  All they wanted to do was to hand out, eat lotus, and get high.

""Lucky for them Odysseus came and dragged them kicking and screaming back to the ship.  He tied them to their seats and ordered the crew to row like hell, in case anyone else might eat the lotus and forget the way home.  

""The story of Odysseus is about more than just a Greek guy in the boat.  It's about the journey people take through life and the obstacles they meet along the way.  The story of the Lotus Eaters speak particularly to us dopeheads.  As addicts, we are stuck in a Lotus Land; we forgot our mission; we forgot the other adventures that awaited us; we forgot about going home.

""Luckily, we had within us our own Odysseus, our own Higher Power, which grabbed us by the collar and threw us back into the boat.  So now we're rowing like hell.  We may not know what's going to come next, but we're on our way through life again.""

im scared of sober. i cant function sober. i cant eat or think or do anything sober. i cant be around people sober or else im just an irriatable ass hole. once im sober for to long, i start looking for ways to become inoxicating. sometimes scouring the floor for dropped weed, throwing the contents of the medicine cabinet on the floor cause nothing in there will get me high.

its gotten worse latley. in the last year, I have lost all my friends.

i just quit going to school. both semesters this year. i made it less than halfway through, then just quit. why? i dont know.

i see the cycle Im in and cant break it. How do i go compleley sober when i cant go a day sober? being sober is so fucking scary you dont even know. what will i havev to look forward to. what will i do? how do i make friends again? ive always been pretty socially akward, finding friends sober at 22 years old is scary an impossible.. i just want a normal life.

At first, it was after I got home from work, then I started getting high all day on my days off.  Before long I started going to work high and since then its been damn near a 24/7 cycle.  I wanted a new job but wouldn't go to places that required testing.  Once I made that realization, I started a pattern of self-loathing and blaming others for my problems.  

Last year, my uncle offered me lucrative work as a paralegal working right under him.  He's a part of some catholic cult, very nosy and a bit of a sociopath, so when my parents told him that I smoked a lot (which he had no idea of), he immediately began treating me differently and started a pattern of verbal abuse.  Unfortunately, I wasn't going to get the same pay as I was making with him anywhere else.  I knew I had to quit but didn't want to. 

My buddy told me about a head shop that sells synthetics so I figured I'd give that a shot.  The brand I got was ok.  It made me more paranoid and also wore me down a lot more.  I pissed clean for a job but I was still getting high all the time, and not even knowing what the synthetic crap was doing to me.  

Yesterday, I took a hit and went to take a shower.  I felt really funny, and felt a little but like I was going to die but managed to keep my mind under control.  I told myself ""calm down, you're on drugs and this will be over soon.""

After about a half hour, I wrapped myself in a towel without bothering to get dressed and went to talk to my girlfriend (who is very much the love of my life).  I gave her my pipe, my bong slider and all of my stash and told her to hide it.  She said we've been through this before and its not gonna work.  But I told her that last time, I had control and now I was passing it to her.  I told her I really needed her help to stop and she said I better be sure because I'm not getting it back.

This morning, I woke up telling myself that this is the first day of a new chapter.  I've been wanting so bad to smoke all day but I went and got myself some gum and just kinda will-powering myself through cravings.  It's now after lunch and I'm feeling ok.

I'm 22, male, and ready to move on with my life. I started smoking at 19 and I've attempted to quit many times but didn't make it for more than a month or so.  I have reactive hypoglycemia and have been using trees to balance out/cover up my emotions.  I have to stay on a no sugar/no simple carb diet in order to balance my blood sugar but I'm not used to it yet.. It's not easy.  When I stop smoking all of my anxiety and bad emotions return but they're extremely overpowering since I'm not used to handling them anymore. I decided that I won't be smoking today and I couldn't make it to work. I work in a call center and I just couldn't face up to talking to strangers all day. I called out sick. I'm worried about my job now, but it was either smoke resin so I can face work or call out. 


I already feel like I want to run off to a friends and smoke some trees  ""for the last time"", but I know that I'll have that urge the next time I try to quit anyways, so if I give in then I'll be right back at the beginning again anyways.  


I don't know what to do with my day. I'm alone. The only friend that I have to hang out with today smokes trees all day. I feel like a wimp who can't even control his emotions and urges.  My finances are wrecked. I barely skim by from paycheck to paycheck because of how much I've spent on weed.

I guess this is it. I'm going to put out into public (moreso) something I've been working on admitting to myself for a while. I've got to quit, or at least take a good long break. I do have a slightly different than usual reason though.

I am definitely habitually addicted. Lately, I've been smoking in small amounts tons of times a day. This has been varying for a while, between once or twice, and a shitload, but it's something that doesn't want to stop. I'm not very good at moderation, and that's an issue.

However, there is a bit of a bigger piece to this puzzle, and another thing I'm dealing with. Right now, I'm less than a year post an operation on my brain to remove (partially) a tumor. This has done some damage to one of my memory lobes, and the performance of my short term memory. With the amount of evidence of the effect of weed on both the performance, as well as the growth and adaptation of this part of the brain, it's gotta go at least while my brain heals it seems.

I had to do this right away, as soon as I found out a bit over a year ago about the tumor, with alcohol. Somehow it wasn't so bad. The alcohol was proven to have direct risk of seizure. That's an easy motivator. At first, and for months after, I quit dope too. Probably from November until late march really. It was good, I was more organized, motivated, recovered extremely well. But then it came back, with a vengeance. When I compromised and let myself smoke again, almost immediately it raced back worse than ever. It's been bugging me now for a couple months. I've taken short breaks. I've told myself I'd be moderate. etc etc. But I keep falling back to it, and it's holding me back. And then, beyond that, at least right now, I don't think even moderation is really okay.

I have to quit. It's going to be hard, but I've got to do it. I don't know if I want to just draw some black line like ITS GONE, then throw away my bong, get rid of my little vape, get rid of the rest of my bag... I'm going to miss smoking. It's fun. I've had good times, good thoughts. I've lost myself in movies and video games. I've met people, laughed, and had good memories. Maybe gained a couple pounds, lost a couple marks, forgotten a couple things, but dope has been a great part of my life while I've been young. I struggled with moderation the whole time, and its definitely not helped me in some ways, but I'm certain it did in others.

Sadly though, I think the sun is setting for dope in my life. I'm gonna finish the little bit I've got,  then my first goal is going to be to not buy  any more to smoke alone. I'm going to let myself say goodbye to it over christmas break with some old friends, a couple little social moments. I'm going to give my smoking supplies to friends for christmas. I've already been working on new goals, new hobbies, new outputs to take place of this. They're starting already. I'm going to go skiing more, I'm now more focused on the gym, I have some work I do, and I'll be in neuropsych appointments, retraining my memory. I'm going to travel, and have fun, and work hard. Maybe in a couple years when I've made results with my recovery, and developed a new habitual pattern I'm comfortable with and confident about, I'll let it back in for a fun, moderate outlet. Some weekends, smoke a doob and watch a movie with friends. Or go fishing and roll one up sometimes in the summer. But I can never be a real ent again.

I'll be one of those hobbits, riding on the shoulders, fascinated, but separate from the trees. And on a glorious mission.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_ncjsn,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/ncjsn/a_bit_of_special_motivation_to_quit/,

As a relatively infrequent user of Marijuana, I've recently done some long overdue introspection and determined that THC is just not my kind of drug. It degrades every aspect of my personality, from my social skills and internal thought process. The highest I've ever been, I became truly ""selfless"", in the sense that I couldn't think or do anything, a body without an ego (in the good sense of the word). 

Looking back, every good time or meaningful conversation I've had on weed has been in spite of the high, not because of it. Apparently it works for some people, just not me.

I never smoked all day, every day, or anything like that, but I feel weed has been in general more negative than positive for me. I don't feel like I need any kind of community support, either, but I just wanted to put this out there to formalize it for myself and to add my own small contribution to the most excellent ""quitting culture"" I've observed in this subreddit.

First time poster. Long time lurker. Fantastic subreddit. 

Been smoking now for 4 years - infrequently. Possibly a gram a week. 

I've been wanting to stop so I can wake up without the cravings, get a job that requires a d-test; and get on with my life.

I stopped from Jan-April of this year - it was hard but I started working out instead, I could finally run a mile without wheezing and coughing. I felt great. 

I relapsed for a day afterwards sometime this month and I feel I cannot go down this path again. 

My friends are coming back from college this summer (I am a recent graduate roughly 1.5 years out) and I feel I would relapse hard. They all smoke, all my friends do. I know, I know - get new friends? Don't hang out with them. I've known them my whole life, and they live across the street. *The kicker is* - they want to stop too. But we are both waiting who brings it up first, caves first, and the other ones with follow. 

Every year we'd sit outside on our porch, burning purple flowers led by having great conversation, opening up under a topical level, making food and hanging out.

I went into credit card debt buying 1/8-1/4 a week for myself. It's been untenable for a while now; I wasn't even really getting high anymore. I would try to make it last longer and fail over and over. If I have it, I smoke it, constantly.

I'd like to get to a point where I can enjoy it once in a while. Like one day a month. Actually get stoned and enjoy it, instead of it just being what I do, a total habit. I am in an educational program that ends in mid-April. I'm going to completely abstain until then, and have a graduation smoke. But never start smoking like I have been.

The first few nights of detox (I've tried to quit before too) I always sweat like a pig, especially at night, and get very poor sleep. I have a few days of heightened emotions and anxiety and feel like I can't deal. I feel nauseated and averse to food. I develop brainfog and can't remember shit.

I got through that and now I'm feeling good. It was less than a week of shitty symptoms and now I feel normal. I think about it occasionally throughout the day but I do not feel driven to go pick up and start again.

I'm overweight, trying to lose weight, and it's amazing how I just plowed through food without a thought. When I was high I couldn't limit myself even if I knew it was technically a bad idea. I'm continually shocked how I am leaving half of my food on my plate, feeling totally full. I've lost a nearly 10 pounds already. How easy it is to control my portions is what is keeping me from wanting weed. I'm associating pot use with me being a fatass and if I want one to change, I have to change the other.

In short, if you haven't quit yet but know that you're spending too much $ and not even getting high anymore... do it. Get through that first week or less. It is miserable but worth it. It does get better and once you see a single benefit (better respiration, weight loss, more motivation) you can cling to it as the main reason to stay clean.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_g2njd,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/g2njd/i_quit_and_after_a_few_days_of_hell_im_feeling/,

I've found my home in NA meetings, and was surprised to see lots of others struggling with Marijuana addiction. I know my experience has been that I can't seem to use any drugs or alcohol without things getting massively out of control. 

My addiction experience involves other drugs as well, primarily abusing anxiety medication, and alcohol abuse. Pot was always my favorite, dependable friend. I relied on it for years to deal with any and all feelings, to celebrate &amp; mourn, etc. 

In the last 2 or 3 years, I had lost my job, my friends, my family had lost faith in me, and I had lost myself entirely. Every day was constant fear, as I had developed paralyzing fears of going out in public (agoraphobia). I was a social person trapped in horrible obsessive fear. My life was hell. As they say, when I was beaten, I became willing. . 

Went to my first meeting and was terrified. I was greeted by some incredible women, one whom ended up being my first sponsor. Slowly but surely, things got better. Taking little risks (the right kinds, like making healthy friends and participating in meetings by making coffee or doing readings) and feeling a sense of pride for those victories. Baby steps, self compassion, patience, and taking things moment by moment. 

I've made some incredible friendships in recovery so far. I love NA, always feel welcome in meetings. It's what worked for me - I needed a healthy support system that has 'been there'. I also began working with a counselor and started to work through some of my baggage. 

It seems daunting at first. **Every day that you stay clean is a success.** Be kind to yourselves, keep coming back and don't feel alone in the journey. It gets better!

I feel like my body is falling apart, and I need to stop.",withoutlogicorreason,23,8,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1j9o4x/ive_smoked_every_single_day_for_over_four_years_i/,"Jesus Christ, where do I even start? I started smoking pot when I was a kid, like twelve or thirteen. A friend of mine asked me if I would smoke some weed with him if he got some, and I said I would. The next weekend he came over and we smoked shit brown ditch weed out of an aluminum can with matches in the bushes outside my parent's house. I did not get high, although I did not know this. The weekend after that, my friend came back with some sticky bud and a glass pipe. My sister had a doll house out back, so we smoked in there. My mind was not prepared for what was about to happen.

By the time we got back inside the actual house, I was baked. I had a little panic attack right in my kitchen, overwhelmed by what I was experiencing. It was the most intense experience in my life up until that point, and I was basically hooked right then and there. I immediately fell in love with weed. Head over heels.

I started smoking every chance I could get. All the money I could obtain went to buying weed. My mom and dad were both very successful in their professions, so getting money wasn't difficult. My father died about five years ago, and my parents got divorced before that. My sister and I split his money, so that's how I pay for my habit now. If my situation was different, I wouldn't be able to afford this lifestyle without growing.

Shortly after high school I joined the military. I had been kicked out of my mom's home and had no way to make money. I suspect I knew there was something wrong with my relationship with pot, and subconsciously hoped that the military would ""fix"" me. I spend 4 years in the military, essentially hating life and drinking every chance possible. I got in trouble several times for drinking, and was known as a drunk. I was told to attend AA meetings. This was my first encounter with 12 step programs.

I got out, and immediately started smoking again. Big time. Bigger than ever, because I had money now due to my dad's death. I'm in college now, and it's very difficult to consistently perform because I'm constantly baked. I basically have no real friends, only vague associates. I live in CA, so I have a medical card. There's really nothing unusual or special about what I'm doing, except for the quantity and consistency.

I've started to go to NA meetings, but it's difficult for me because I don't believe their bullshit. I'm an atheist, and I feel like too much of the ""program"" revolves around a theistic religion. The only reason I go is because they're really the only people I have to socialize with right now. I'm not honest in the meetings about my ""clean date"", and go to fairly dramatic lengths to mask the fact that I'm baked, with dubious success. I suspect there are a few people I'm not fooling. I also tell everyone that I'm addicted to Oxycontin. I'm embarrassed that my ""drug of choice"" is a fucking plant when all of those people are hooked on crack, speed, or dope. I feel like they look down on me as not having a real problem, and now I'm sticking with my lie because I don't want to have to explain any of this shit. I'm been going to these meeting for over three years. The longest I've managed to stay clean was 8 months, and then I just couldn't go on. I was losing my fucking mind.

These days, I wake up and smoke, and smoke all day unless there's something that I absolutely have to go do. Then I air myself out for a bit, put some eyedrops in, take care of it, and start smoking again. I watch TV, Netflix, or occasionally play a video game. I pick up a guitar from time to time, but not as much as I should. I know I can make my life something more than this endless cycle of obsession and compulsion. 

I sometimes think that all of this could be fixed with a relationship, but I don't have any real friends. I've thought about this for a while now, and I think the smartest thing I could possibly do is to stop smoking weed. I cough up some fucked up looking black shit every other day, I can't run... I'm generally terrified to know of the extent of the damage I've done to my body. I haven't informed a doctor about my behavior because I'm embarrassed. Isn't that human? How quintessentially human. I might have some sort of terrible cancer, and I'm not getting any kind of medical attention because of a fear of diminishing a doctor's positive perception of me. God damn it, that's just plain irrational.

I've tried to quit recently, and can make it about a day. I start to feel pretty bad pretty fast. My sleeping habits are completely fucked as they are, and the insomnia from the withdrawal isn't fun. Other symptoms of acute marijuana withdrawal that I experience are diminished appetite, nausea, and irritability. These kick in after a few hours, and the most difficult one is the eating thing. Food is completely unappealing unless I've literally just got done smoking a bowl. 

I can't go on like this. I'm going to be 30 in a few years, and I need to figure out how to live my life without constantly smoking this plant. I keep telling myself I'll quit tomorrow, just one more day, but I've been telling myself that for years now. I'm going out of the country on a vacation next month. I'll be forced to stop for two weeks, and my intention is to make my stand when I get back.

Well, I'm just about baked enough to go to sleep. It's 3 in the morning. I picked up earlier today and didn't have anything else to do, so I've been smoking all day. My chest hurts, but I'm going to smoke probably three or four more bowls before going to sleep. I'm kind of not feeling it so much anymore since I sat down to write this.

Sometimes, I think about how different my life would of been if my friend had never asked me to smoke weed with him. I'm sure that it would of happened eventually, though. There's just something about this feeling that makes being baked seem worth the consequences, but, ultimately, I feel like I've been chasing something that was never really there to begin with. I feel like I can change things, though. I believe that people can change, but how that happens is largely mysterious, and the path forward is unclear.

I used to need it to fit in, not anymore.

So, at a festival no less, I stopped smoking. Gave all my supplies to my best friend, asking her not to return them to me. It's been five days now. I still have smoking stuff at home but I haven't touched it.

I was a daily smoker for 10 years and have finally made it over a month. There have been a lot of ups and downs over the past month but I feel like I am really starting to balance out. The thing I miss the most is basically tranquilizing myself before going to sleep. But even that has faded drastically and overall my quality of sleep has gotten much better. My confidence and clarity has improved and I am able to see things more clearly. Over the first couple of weeks I was faced with very strong urges and thought processes of, “do I really want to do this?” “I love weed, why would I want to give it up?” Now that the haze has passed, it has become clear that these messages were just my brain trying to play tricks on me. If you are on leaves, there is obviously a reason and you know that weed is hindering you in one way or another. Initially the thought of never smoking again was terrifying and felt like saying goodbye to an old friend forever. I was finally able to convince myself that there is no harm in quitting for a short period (in the grand scheme of things). Something like a year or at least enough time to get disciplined and closer to my goals. Knowing that I wasn’t saying goodbye forever and having that hope in the back of my mind has made it easier to make it through the first month. Now that I have made it this far, my urges are gone for the most part. Of course, there are difficult times and moments of weakness and there always will be. But I am happier than I have been in a long time and am starting to comfortably embrace the idea that I might be done for good. I have no problem with weed, I think it is great and should be legalized and don’t judge others who choose to use it. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people. I abused it and if I smoke again I will abuse it again. So I’m done. We had a good run but now it’s time for me to grow up and truly reach my potential. Which is something I am sure would never be possible while living in a constant haze. On a side note, a turning point that finally let me know that I was in a good spot was when I was truly able to watch and enjoy television while sober. It sounds dumb, but I wasn’t able to enjoy TV or movies unless I was high. I had associated them for so many years that I wasn’t able to enjoy them for the first 3 weeks. Every time I would turn the TV on, my brain would say, “ok here we go, the TV is on, let’s get high!” So I stopped watching TV for a while and started reading. Now I am at the point where I can truly enjoy quality television and actually remember it the next day. This was a huge turning point for me and a reminder of how addicted I was. Some things that really helped me get to this point: Isolation from my smoking friends. It was tough but I pretty much became a hermit for a month. I locked myself in my house and started focusing on my health, hobbies and passions. I took it easy on drinking for a month as well. Not good to trade one for another but for me the biggest part of this was avoiding hangovers. When I am hungover, all I can think about is smoking weed. In times of weakness, give yourself 10 minutes and browse leaves and see what other people have to say. Don’t forget that it is not going to be easy and your brain will try to play tricks on you. Remember that your brain is constantly seeking comfort. He is a scumbag after all. So he will tell you things like, “Hey one more night, what does it matter if you start tomorrow?”  Or, “Hey, let’s just smoke on the weekends. That shouldn’t be too hard right?” Next thing you know, it’s monday night and you are high and still have a half a sack left. If you are thinking about quitting, do it. If it’s not for you, then you can start again in 6 months or whatever. But what harm is there in giving yourself some true clarity and making sure that you are truly doing what is best for your well being. If you are hazy and caught up in addiction, you are not yourself and you are not necessarily making the decision that is best for you, regardless of what your brain might be telling you at the time.

It sounds a lot like yours, I'm guessing. I'm a young guy with a lot of potential who started smoking weed in high school, and whose quality of life steadily deteriorated in the months and years after. I had my fair share of problems before my relationship with weed began, just like any other teenager. But I was working on my issues, and I was on my way to becoming a better person. And then, when I was a junior, I smoked my first joint. Within months I was hanging out with the druggies and hot boxing my car at lunch. All of my other interests, all the things I cared about, took a backseat to weed. I'm not gonna lie: it was awesome for a while. But nothing is fun for forever, and there is no ""miracle"" drug. There are downsides to all of them. Well, things got shitty fast after it became a daily indulgence, and they stayed that way. Now, two years and hundreds of grams later, disgusted by the person I've become, I am putting an end to this awful cycle of self destruction and self loathing.  

Because of weed I nearly dropped out of high school. Because of weed I have lost more friends than I care to admit; good people who I was no longer willing to hang out with because they didn't smoke. Because of weed, I lost all motivation to better myself. I grew content with my idleness, lulled into submission by nightly dopamine rushes and fast food binges, and endless hours staring like an idiot at youtube videos and shitty netflix movies. I stopped working out and eating healthy, and now I have permanent bags under my eyes and pockets of fat where there was only skin and bone before. And I stopped making music and writing stories, preferring to consume the work of others and applaud myself for my good taste rather than acting on my own creative impulses, which would have required actual effort. 

Now I'm 19, and I'm trying my hardest to destroy this habit before it eats up the rest of my youth. I hate being a deadbeat. There is nothing romantic or charming about the stoner lifestyle in my eyes. I recognize that clearly now in sobriety. I want to be the best version of myself possible, and I can't do that when I'm stoned silly every afternoon. So I'm giving up the herb for good. I know it will be difficult, and I know relapse is always waiting around the corner, but I'm confident that I can do this. Just yesterday I sold the rest of my weed, took a hammer to my glass collection, and erased the numbers of everyone who's ever sold me a dime bag. 

When the going gets especially hard, I'm just going to try to remind myself how good it feels to be healthy and free of addiction, to be the sole master of my own mind. I want to be proud again, to be confident about my looks and my social skills. I want to be happy, genuinely happy, not artificially, and that's just not possible when I'm smoking weed.

Got the job, been green-free for over a year now. The first few weeks were horrendous, seeing as most the ppl I knew smoked and still do. 

I'm used to smoking many bowls a day, and now nothing. Has it been better for me? I don't particularly think so. Weed used to help me out so much mentally. And now I don't have that.

I started smoking towards the end of my senior year of college. Right from the first hit, it was AWESOME. Within a few months I was smoking all day, every day.  Wake and bake, smoke before (and during) work, smoke before going out, smoke before practicing music, smoke at rehearsals, smoke before gigs, etc. 

The problems didn't seem so obvious at first, because I kept moving along in my career, and some of my bands were (and still are) truly excellent.  But the problems were there, and have only gotten bigger as the years have passed.  When I smoke, I get quiet, introverted, lazy, stupid, uninspired and useless. I stop calling my friends, I rebuff invitations to go out and have fun, I stop trying new things. I sit at home and smoke and smoke and smoke, and before I know it another day has gone completely to waste.  

Things have come to a head in recent months. I'll spare you the details and just say that every day became the same. Wake up, smoke, go to work, come home, smoke and smoke and smoke until I pass out. I'm alone all the time and depressed as a motherfucker. Some of my friends have kept smoking and found awesome partners on the same wavelength; others have given up the weed altogether or cut way back.  Either way, they are all moving forward with their lives, starting families and buying homes and accomplishing great things in their careers.  And all the while, I'm doing ok in my career but I'm still sitting here blazing every day, alone, letting myself fall apart in various ways and feeling like a fucking loser. 

I skimmed through /r/leaves a few months ago and made a mental note to come back if I ever felt ready. And in recent weeks I have been thinking about making some changes. It started to feel like I only had two options - quit smoking, or curl up in a ball and die from sadness and loneliness. About two weeks ago I cut the ol' wake and bake out of my routine.  Going to work sober-ish was kind of nice, but I was still miserable and running home every day to light up as soon as work was done.  So last week I took another step and cut tobacco out of my diet (I was smoking a lot of joints with tobacco in 'em, which seemed to make my mood swings much more volatile).  That helped a little bit, but it still was not enough. 

Then last night I came back here and read your posts and comments for hours (even though I was blazing the whole time).  [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1gh0mr/quitting_tomorrow_after_smoking_daily_for_20/calmhtp) in particular really struck a chord. I saw myself in that comment, and something clicked when I read it - I believe the alcoholics call it a ""moment of clarity."" I smoked a couple of more bowls and kept reading for a while ... and then around 11pm I gathered up everything I had - my stash, pipes, rolling papers, lighters, ash trays, etc. - threw it all in a plastic bag and went for a walk, with the intention of throwing it all in a dumpster. But as I was walking I had a better idea and hopped on the subway. 

Not too long after that, I was at a drawbridge over one of the dirtiest, nastiest, foulest, most polluted waterways in the world.  I waited till the coast was clear, and then last night right around midnight, with my heart pounding so hard I thought my chest would explode, I threw all my smoking-related items into the Gowanus Canal and walked away. 

Today was my first day of truly voluntary sobriety in 16 years. Thank you /r/leaves. I don't know how long this will last, but I know I would not have taken this step without you.  ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1h0mv8,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1h0mv8/too_many_wasted_years/,

1369749931.0,15,self.leaves,1f76g9,6 Months. It's still hard work.,fresh__start,15,0,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1f76g9/6_months_its_still_hard_work/,"The time has really flown by. Today is 180 days; in two days it'll be 6 months by the calendar. I stopped on November 30. I smoked for 15 years, 10 daily, 6 waking and baking. 

Sorry for the wall. I have a lot on my mind about this lately. Thanks to anyone who reads it all. Feel free to read any one part. 

* It's still hard, but not in the same ways it was at the beginning. It's a deeper kind of hard. The work of finding new ways to cope with stress and anxiety. But it's rewarding work. I think I am going to have to stay vigilant about this for a very long time (as in, years). I know if I smoked now, I would be very vulnerable to going back to my old ways. 6 months really isn't a long time when a lifetime is considered. It's still nice to celebrate the achievement, but I have a long way to go.

* I've gained weight. I would have thought I'd lose weight because munchies, but it's been the opposite. I've seen several posts here recently about how to replace the reward of smoking that a lot of us fell into the habit of, and I replied that there really isn't such a thing. I think I've unconsciously been eating to soothe an uncomfortable feeling or stress; and eating to treat myself when I've had a good day. My partner and I were talking about this last night. He's overweight, and he was saying he can see how he thinks of food as a reward, but that pretty much every day he can come up with some reason to overeat (last day of school, I'm on the road, someone is in town, it's the weekend). I said I can identify completely, and he knew just what I was talking about. This is something I have to work on. I want to lose the weight and stop looking to reward or soothe myself on a daily basis.

* My partner been wonderfully supportive, by the way. He was always great about letting me be with my habit, not making judgements in either direction -- that I should or shouldn't smoke. I was scared to ask him how I'm different now, but I did ask. He says I'm more fun and spontaneous now. He said I was always fun, but now it's a different kind of fun. I don't have to smoke before everything, so it's easier to make snap decisions to do something cool. More adventurous. I like that too. 

* I am a lady, and I have noticed a strong correlation between my desire to smoke and my cycle. I think pot was easing my PMS symptoms way more than I realized. I miss that. It made the moodiness easier to deal with, eased cramps. Now, when I reach those emotional moments before my period, I find my mind wishing I could smoke to just calm me down and put it aside, especially because it's only hormonal -- it's not like I'm upset because I have some real problem I need to solve. My body is just letting that stuff out, and it's uncomfortable and inconvenient. But, the awareness helps. ""It's PMS. It'll pass. I don't need to smoke.""

* Sober life is not boring. I definitely had to do some mental adjusting at the beginning to realize this, but it's true. I feel more free; I'm not chained to my habit like I was. Movies are still funny and visually interesting. Nature is still a beauty to behold. There's a trade, and when you're high it's hard to see it. Even though it seems like you're gaining something by smoking (movies are funnier, you have more creative ideas, nature blows your mind), you're also giving up something. The movie might be funnier, but you can barely remember it afterward. You might have an amazing idea, but you don't do anything with the idea.

* I'm going to keep hanging around /r/leaves. I'd thought about taking space from it, to move on, but I need to stay. You're all so helpful. I'm sure this is why AA tells people to go to meetings daily, even when they've been sober a long time. This is hard work, and the daily support keeps me mindful of what I'm doing and way. I've also made a nice handful of anonymous friends here, so thank you to those buddies, especially /u/JoshTay. And thanks to /u/Subduction. You have created a wonderful space, and I'm sure I owe a lot to my achievements so far to the support I have found here. Newbs, be sure to read this post from Subduction, which describes the long-term benefits of being quit in a very moving way. http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1dv0vq/my_sister_died_last_wednesday_after_a_battle_with/",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1f76g9,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1f76g9/6_months_its_still_hard_work/,

That, of course, increased, and it seems like I needed to smoke more to get through my days of high stress and frustration. 

I am now at a point where I want to learn how to start on phasing mj out of my life. I knew cold turkey wouldn't work, so my first step was to break all of my glass pieces (primary form of consumption), only leaving me with my vaporizer and nothing else. I am hoping that will curb the urge when I literally can't get that hit I want and am forced to go something more productive. 

I am not quitting out of any urgent reason or external forces, by all appearances I am doing well and succeeding in life. (just got my master's degree last week!)

 It's just that when I started smoking I was young, shy, and always over thinking things, and it helped me be the social person I was always afraid of being. 

However over the last 7 years I KNOW I've grown as a person and now I just kind of want to see who that person is now while sober. I have a feeling he's a really freaking cool guy who'se just been masked down by my other habits. I'm really looking foreword to meeting him someday soon.

So my question, am I doing the right thing to start the process? Not all at once, but start taking responsible small steps to slowly adjust (hopefully forever)?

I've been academically dismissed from my university with a 1.26 GPA (I held a 4.0 throughout high school). I started smoking when I was 19 in January of 2012 and it quickly escalated from every Friday to twice a week, to every night, to all day everyday within about 2 months. Like anybody, I never thought I was addicted... until I failed all of my classes at university this past fall '12 (literally 4 F's 0.0 GPA). I smoked anywhere from 1-3 grams (guesstimate) a day varying on who I hung out with (some people smoked me out). I also gave rides to my dealer buddy who would smoke me out a lot. The same dealer buddy would also come over to my apartment everyday at around 11 am to smoke, he kept his $500 bong there since he lived in the dorms nearby. I only smoked for a year but I bought at least a quarter a week, sometimes more. I never really kept track of my consumption and that is the scariest part. I just know that I numbed myself because I didn't want to deal with life and all of the anxieties it brings. The worst part is I lied about my grades and addiction to myself and my parents for this whole past year and now they have trouble trusting me. I initially got into weed because I wanted to try it for its relaxation purposes, I had always been an anxious and nervous kid so I figured it would help quell some of my racing thoughts. It did, but far too much, to the point of no thoughts. I loved weed and it really helped me sometimes, but I ultimately couldn't handle it. Its time to say goodbye to it. 

Background: I was a very straight edge kid (no alcohol or any mind altering substances) until I was 19, which was when I went off to college. I first smoked in January 2012 with a few college friends I had met, I never had felt more connected to friends than that night. I thought weed was the best thing for my social life, and for awhile it was, I made a lot of friends through smoking. It made me relax, and I have always had trouble sleeping and not dwelling on my mistakes. I obsess over things very easily and one might even say I have an addictive personality. I was addicted to WoW (world of warcraft) and have probably 2 years of logged playtime into that game ( played from 8th grade-12th grade). I played that game for about 4-12 hours a day for probably a solid two or three years. So, I can easily become obsessed with things, and smoking was no exception. 

But this past spring semester I took a class that truly inspired me to do something with my life and stop rotting away in a hazy apartment. I took an intro to math and science education course that involved teaching real lessons to real local 3rd-5th grade classes. I loved it, I never felt more satisfied with something in my life, and I could truly pursue something meaningful. I have a meeting with the dean on Friday to try and convince him that I have the capability to do pull my GPA up and never falter academically again. The reason why I failed is pretty stupid, I didn't go to class, instead I got high and played video games with my friends. Sometimes I would miss because I slept in (pretty much any class before 11 am falls into this category, which was 2 of my fall '12 classes). What I'm getting at is this- I have to present a narrative of how my addiction to smoking caused me to fail so miserably to the dean of my university so that he will reinstate me for one more semester. I already have met with him once where he told me that if I do well enough when he readmits me, he can erase a couple of F's to bring my GPA to the 2.0 required. I'm supposed to have a compelling reason for why I failed and some proof that I've turned around, that I'm ready for school now. I feel like I've thrown away a lot of love, trust, money, and time. I need this second chance to redeem myself, I realize now that my education is everything to me and that I really want to be a chemistry teacher. I know this isn't very well organized and I'm sorry for the wall of text but I just need to write something down to solidify some of my thoughts. I know that substance abuse has been seen as a compelling enough reason before, I only hope mine is compelling enough. Thanks for reading.

Things change, however.

I've never had this mindset about anything in my life before and it is simultaneously the scariest and most stressful period, but it's also the time when I feel like I'm actually doing that ""follow your dreams"" thing that you hear so much about.

Weed is great. It's better than alcohol and man it's fucking amazing to smoke after a stressful day or even a non-stressful day. This isn't about weed. It's about facing life without a crutch that makes you tolerate where you're at. It's about setting your own course and being the master of your own destiny.

1365873661.0,14,self.leaves,1c9zik,Well its been a week and i promised an update! (long),Laugh_Together,15,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1c9zik/well_its_been_a_week_and_i_promised_an_update_long/,"I can honestly say this has been the longest week of my life. It started off as rocky as the grand canyon then smoothed out like the great plains then BACK to the grand canyon i went, and here i am now.

The first weekend was tough, i would have usually listened to music and just chilled for the duration of my Saturday. I had been doing that for about 4 years so this was a big wake up call. I made it through by still listening to music but finding new bands and hitting the 'Random' button on reddit many times. That random button is a godsend, it took me to places like /r/LucidDreaming, /r/gardening and /r/DIY. These places all helped me forget about my past habit. I've made plans to build my own mini garden in whatever space i have and to also start a bit of woodworking. I'll be growing things like Calendula, Ginger, Basil, Yarrow, Lavender, Sage and Nettle. These herbs all have their own  specific healing properties and are great ailments. I plan on harvesting lots of them and making salves (can't forget to label them, that would be a travesty!) and the such. And with woodworking, well really its been something i've always wanted to do but have been too deep into a drug induced haze to go through with it. I plan on crafting things like  a lock box, storage boxes, an Altar (/r/occult), a mortar and pestle and even some of my own dice. Unfortunately where i live its too cold and rainy to follow through with much of these plans but there is always time to prepare. Another big thing i have noticed is that there is so much more time in the day to do what you wish when you aren't sitting around getting high all the time. 

It hasn't been all dandelions and roses though. Yesterday was a really shit day. I have relationship problems, school anxiety and work anxiety. I came home yesterday ready to bawl my eyes out and i did. It felt great! I just kept yelling and yelling about whatever it was that was bothering me and by the end of it turned on the kettle and listened to some music. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19imxFvT5bQ) It was the darkest episode i have had in a while, i just felt like curling up into a ball and falling asleep for years. But i took myself to the local flea market and bought myself this cool chinese porcelain tea cup that has its own built in strainer and everything. I came home and begrudgingly made myself a strong cup of early grey and listened to some music and just sort of stared at my wall a bit. I forced myself outside through a forest near a lake where i sat and listened to some more music until it was dark. I took myself home and woke up this morning feeling more awake and loving than i have ever felt in a while. 

This is all relevant because with my past habits i would have just skinned a spliff and kept all those emotions bottled up and leave myself feeling like an emotional blank. 

I think the real point here is that in order to succeed, you need to have a big lifestyle change. If you find yourself doing the same things you were doing while smoking then you inevitability relapse.

All in all, i still have a very long way to go and think that there will be even deeper lows and higher highs in the future. You just have to accept that and  be ready for it because it will come. 

One note about one of the symptoms of withdrawal; vivid dreams. Take advantage of it, really! There are plenty of folks over at /r/luciddreaming who would kill for dreams of that caliber. I have come very close to being conscious in my own dreams but have not achieved it yet. Start a dream journal, it is really an awesome experience and can be quite frightening at first but very rewarding at the end.

I've been wanting to quit for a while for various reasons.. I've been a smoker for almost 6 years now, and have been smoking almost daily for the last 2 of those 6.  I'm out of shape, not eating well, and feel as though my life has been stagnating for quite a while.  I feel generally unhealthy and unhappy with myself.

Recently I've traced most of it back to the weed.

I quit for 31 days from February-March, and it was the best feeling.  I was sleeping better, I could remember my dreams for the first time in years and I was dreaming *every night*, I lost a decent amount of weight and I felt really productive and excited.

But I made the mistake of thinking I could have a few bowls as a celebratory ""end of vacation"" sort of deal in late March. It was a terrible idea. I've smoked almost every day since then, gained back the 5 lbs I lost during the 31 days, and basically I just feel like a lazy sack of shit. 

I'm going to stop smoking again as of today. I'm partnering stopping smoking with trying to cook more so that I have something to occupy my time and energy instead of getting high, and also for the delicious payoff that a healthy, homemade meal offers. Once I get that under my belt I'm going to try and walk at least 15 minutes outside everyday to enjoy the beautiful springtime that has finally arrived here on the east coast. Eventually when I move in June and have more time I'm going to join the YMCA and work out.  I'm going to spend more time with my little brother before he leaves for college, and I'm going to try and be more sociable.  All the money I'm going to be saving from not buying and from not spending a shit ton of money on my munchies is going to be put into a savings account.

I think I can do it this time if I make form small, good habits one at a time. Now that I know that I have no self control and can't have a bowl here or there I am in a much better frame of mind to do this. As dear old Bilbo said, I've put this off for far too long.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1bxavm,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1bxavm/day_1_round_2_if_at_first_you_dont_succeed/,
1365429190.0,15,self.leaves,1bx0n0,Day 1 - I feel good about it this time! Trying some new strategies.,WinterHill,15,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1bx0n0/day_1_i_feel_good_about_it_this_time_trying_some/,"I've ""quit"" or cut back many times before, but inevitably end up back in the same place: smoking everyday, to the point where it seriously impacts both my work and personal life, as most of my free time is spent sitting around, high as a kite. Here's what I'm doing new this time around:

1. I threw all my shit down the drain last night. On previous quitting attempts, I kept a bowl pack or two around to help me through the first week and wean myself off of it. I think that is the wrong state of mind. Now I won't have anything to get me back in the smoking habit.

2. In addition to throwing my stash away, I cleaned the crap out of my bowls. Another downfall for quitting used to be scraping my bowl for resin. Smoking resin is disgusting and even more unhealthy than smoking bud, and  I really don't want to fall back on it. *Protip: boil your pieces in isopropyl rubbing alcohol for 5 min to get rid of all the resin. (use the microwave if you have a stove with an open flame - alcohol is highly flammable).*

3. I'm going to switch to decaf coffee for at least the first week or two. Previously, caffeine really magnified the anxiety I was feeling from quitting, and that's not helpful.

4. I set 2 reminders on my phone to go off everyday. The first is right after lunch for when I'm at work and feeling the anxiety/stress from quitting. It says: *""You will feel stressed out for awhile, and that's ok. Just do your best, even if that's nothing, and everything will work out alright.""* The second is set to go off right when I get out of work, when I'd normally be thinking about blazing. It says: *""Don't smoke [roommate]'s or anyone else's weed! It's the first step to improving your life!""* I feel that these reminders will help keep me motivated.

5. I'm going to tell my smoking buddies that I'm sorry, but I won't be smoking for a while. I might still hang out with them and have a couple beers, but I won't be smoking. Before when I quit, I just ended up calling them and mooching off them for weed because I didn't have any. This might be difficult with my roommate who I smoke with all the time, but I think she will be understanding.

6. Exercising always helps quitting, but it can be difficult in the winter. Spring is upon us, and now it will be easier to get outside and go for a run. Exercise will give me something to do other than smoking, and it will make my body and mind feel better.

I think the turning point for me was last night. I was just sitting in bed totally baked, feeling like shit after a whole weekend of hiding in my bedroom, playing video games and eating junk food. I was thinking about all the things I'd wanted to do in my life by now, and how I haven't done any of them. Being high isn't really even fun anymore. I've become an antisocial and boring person, and my smoking habit is mostly to blame. I really want to get clean, get back in shape, and embrace life instead of watching it float by in a haze.

Wish me luck /r/leaves, I hope I pull it off this time. And if I don't, I hope I have the strength to pick myself back up and try again.

JoshTay: I am a huge fan of your posts. Once again, you make some really good points. I saw a few posts on here the other day where people were genuinely trying their best to taper off and outlining their plans. One person even was making progress but was downvoted to hell. That's analogous to one of us posting in /r/trees saying I'm going to quit cold turkey because i have a problem and this is my plan. And the post gets buried with replies like, ""what? you can't quit weed anytime you want? seriously? Weed is not an addictive... blah blah blah"".

That's why I thought that maybe having a subreddit that accommodates people that are trying to taper off would be a good idea. Maybe once they've tapered off, they could come back to this subreddit. But I did not know that these subreddits already existed. I'm glad to hear that.

One week of smoking, two weeks off. Two weeks of smoking, one week off. Every time I'd smoke after some time off, I would almost instantly regret it. Going back and forth lately, I feel like I have a better perspective on what weed can do to someone than say someone who smokes everyday. See, I have been sober, then high, then sober, then high, unlike most of my friends who just live life in the smokey haze. Last night, after a week of sobriety, I relapsed... again. I tell myself every time that it would be the last relapse, and I'm saying it again now.

When I'm high, I get so into my head and become extremely observant and aware of my surroundings. I become a silent fly on the wall and observe everything that happens in the group I'm with. I really wish I wasn't like this, but when I'm high, I can't control my thoughts. Because I can't do that, I can't control my words or my actions. Why do people like this feeling so much? Anyway, some of my findings about weed over the past couple months include the following:

* weed affects everybody different psychologically, but the physical/mental drawbacks are all pretty similar
* as an introvert, smoking with extroverted stoners was a real difficulty. My thought process is much different than their's. In sobriety, I have to think through everything I say before I say it. It's no problem when I'm sober, as my mind has adapted to the speed of conversation. When I'm in the haze however, not only when I'm high, but during a period in which I smoke semi-regularly, that process becomes very slow, with much self doubt and lack of confidence in the words that do come out. My usual responses when high include ""yeah,"" ""that's cool, man,"" or some other half-assed communication. It's no way to form relationships with others.
* stoners have little friends because they block out everybody in their life that doesn't smoke. The social dynamics within a stoner group is highly complex, without them even knowing it. Because they are basically friends with each other through smoking weed, they are all friends by circumstance, so many of them have different opinions on each person within the group. Because of the stoner mentality of avoiding conflict, the reason someone might become slowly outcasted by the group never gets brought up. I feel like people who smoke one on one and then are in a group environment, want to block out everyone else but their individual stoner buddy. Group discussions within a stoner group (for my case at least) are always pretty slow, unproductive, and a little awkward. I leave those sessions feeling totally stupid and like I wasted a bunch of time.
* for me, my depression/anxiety is directly linked to my marijuana use. I'm so happy and have such zest for life when sober.
* weed stunts emotional growth. My stoner friends hardly ever smile, crack a laugh, get upset, or any show any other emotion other than ""chill."" Living like this, day after day, for months and sometimes years, must have detrimental setbacks on emotional development in a person, and is no way to live a life.

So anyway, the one drawback of being sober is the loneliness, which is usually why I relapse. However, the loneliness is still present when I'm high with friends, in fact it's almost worse because I realize I'm feeling lonely among my friends, making me feel like there's something wrong with me. Then I want to be sober again. It's a vicious cycle, but now that I know why I go back to weed, I can work on not being so lonely (make other friends and such).  Non-stoners are so much more interesting than potheads, too. I hope my findings are relatable for my fellow leave-users, and support your decision to quit.

1363168387.0,14,self.leaves,1a7hg3,A success story about my old roommate. ,regon,17,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1a7hg3/a_success_story_about_my_old_roommate/,"Hello everyone. I just stumbled across this subreddit and it made me instantly think of my freshman roommate. I know that success stories can be motivating, so i thought i'd share this one: 

The summer before my freshman year of college (2010) i was looking for a roommate. Our school provided a roommate finder online. Basically a survey that found the most compatible results. As i was scrolling through my list of potential roommates, i noticed a name of a guy that went to my high school. Let's call this guy Rick. Rick and I were acquaintances. I had a few classes with him and I thought he was a pretty nice, laid back guy. I didn't know him very well but we had some mutual friends so i ran into him at parties and the like. I messaged Rick and from there we decided to room together for our freshman year. 

Now, in high school, i smoked maybe once or twice a week. Usually on the weekends. I was never a habitual user and never smoked alone. It was purely social for me. I knew that Rick also smoked. The guy i bought most of my weed from in high school was a long time friend of mine, and Rick was good friends with this guy. Whenever i picked up from my dealer i would see Rick there, so i had a general idea about the level of his marijuana use. Plus i smoked with Rick a few times in high school. 

The first week at the dorms, Rick noticed a few guys he had played football with back in the days. He started smoking with them and I would tag along occasionally. They were nice guys. They all played for the football team at this college. They mentioned to Rick that they were having a hard time finding weed. Rick, being the intelligent person he was, noticed a business opportunity. He decided to start selling to these guys and their friends (who were pretty much all on the football team). I was fine with it. He smoked me out a lot as a result, and he was pretty smart about it. Slowly, over the course of months, he built up his clientele, and as a result, the amount he was selling. It started at ounces and increased to quarter lbs, half lbs, etc. Fast forward to march, and Rick was pushing about a half pound a week. 

All the while, Rick started smoking a lot more. It went from just smoking with the people he sold to, to smoking multiple times a day. By  march, Rick was smoking many times a day. He was going to class high, he was smoking before he ate, he was smoking before he slept. It got to the point where he couldn't function unless he had smoked. I try not to be a judgmental person, so i didn't say anything about it. But I knew it was pretty fucked up how this guy wasn't hungry unless he was high, and couldn't fall asleep unless he had smoked. And while he was pushing a good amount of weed, he wasn't making any profit because he was smoking it away.

It came to a climax one day in spring when he got caught with a large amount. It sucked because it was just a routine traffic stop. Rick had around a pound or so in his car as well as baggies. The cops smelled weed and Rick got busted. Needless to say, he got fucked. He was lucky this happened over spring break because he ended up serving 5 or so days in jail. 

I was surprised as to how Rick handled it. He basically saw it as a sign that he needed to stop smoking for good.  It was rough for him for the first month or so. He lost weight as his appetite decreases, and he had to get a prescription for sleep medication. But he carried on. 

Now, we both hated the college we were going to. Around January or so i decided that i was going to transfer by next year. He ended up following suit. We transferred to the same school but decided to not room together. We remained good friends though. His grades dramatically improved. He was always a smart guy, but really wasn't motivated. He went from being a C student to an A student. He also got a girlfriend who he is still with, he improved his diet dramatically, got a job, and started working out more. 

He remained sober for about a year and a half. He smokes occasionally now, but it's nothing like it was before. He kept up his grades, his relationship, diet, etc. I really believe getting busted was a good experience for him. 

I know for a lot of you guys you aren't going to have a dramatic experience like this. But i wanted to let you know that you really can improve your life by not smoking, or at least, smoking less. Personally, ever since Rick got busted, i've decreased my pot usage by a lot. I was smoking about once a day back then, and now i smoke maybe once a month. A lot of that has to do with money (i still can't understand how self titled ""poor college students"" afford so much weed) but it also has to do with what i saw in Rick. I go to the gym a lot now (i've gained around 25 lbs of muscle in the last two years) and i'm generally pretty happy. 

Anyway.. sorry if that was a long read. I wish you guys success on your journey. Personally, i'm trying to abstain from jacking off right now (it's only been like 3 days though.. ha) so i understand the temptation  involved",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1a7hg3,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1a7hg3/a_success_story_about_my_old_roommate/,

But now I feel like if I were to get caught, it could be devastating to my future career before it even gets going. 

Pot HAS also made me a lazier person, and I need to take responsibility for that. I've talked about quitting in the past, but have never actually done it.

I'm a 22 year old male, and started smoking *literally* the first day of college, and never stopped. Blunts, bongs, joints, bowls, spliffs, what have you. I managed it pretty well the first three years, even graduated college a year early, but since I moved back home in the interim before grad school, it got much much worse. I'd roll out of bed every morning and start the day with a bowl and a cigarette. I'd go on to smoke eight or nine bowls throughout the day. Just totally zonked for the last year. 

Yesterday, I got into the most selective MFA program in the country. I figured: time to give this shit up. Gonna smoke one more bowl, and flush the rest. So I did. I packed the bowl, smoked it clean, threw out all my bowls, bongs, pieces, etc and flushed the weed.

I then had the second worst panic attack of my life. I thought I was dying though, of course, I knew I wasn't. Couldn't sit still. Felt like I had to keep moving or else I was going to slip into a coma or something. Highly dramatic, but I couldn't control my thoughts at all. 

Suffice it to say that once it wore off, I was so glad that I'd flushed the rest of my stash and made this pact.

And then today: I had the worst panic attack of my life. For full disclosure, I am a person who suffers from mental illness entirely unrelated to weed, predating my first joint by many years. I think I convinced myself that weed was helping this whole time-- even though it surely was canceling out the SSRIs I've been off and on throughout the last few years. 

The attack was total hell. I was at dinner with my dad, and then, for no reason whatsoever, everything changed. My heart was going off like an untethered jackhammer, my hands were like ice, I was sweating, all color was gone from my face. I chalked it up as just a strange panic attack until I realized (perhaps a bit later than I should have): this is withdrawal. This is what it's like when you alter your already-fragile body chemistry every day, all day, for four years, and then stop on a whim.

I have *zero* desire to ever smoke weed again; I am just hoping that these grand-scale panic attacks will not persist. Because they're frightening as hell. ",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_19trli,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/19trli/day_one/,

It's really good to be here. I've been lurking for a few months, but I felt like I had to wait until I was ready to commit to start posting. Well, three days ago, I finished the weed I had in my house, I told myself I was done, and I'm not looking back.

My backstory: 33 yo, been toking since I was 18, very heavily for about a decade. I've stopped for a week a few times when I was travelling, and for a few months once when I was on the road for work, but every time I would toke up as soon as the opportunity was there. These were more forced quits rather than something that I wanted.

This time, quitting is what I want. I reached this point because I came to the realization that stopping smoking weed was the #1 best thing I could do to improve the quality of my life.

I already have a good job, a beautiful wife, an awesome son, two cars, one house (and a second on the way), and pretty much anything I wanted in life (including as much weed as I could handle). I don't make tons of money, but I'm very good at managing the money that I do make. From outward appearances, most people would probably think that I'm making more than I actually do.

That being said, I've been spending over $6000/year on weed for the past few years. THAT IS INSANE! Even though my bank account could handle it, I began to realize all the other nice things or experiences I could spend that money on.

I'm also so sick and tired of coughing up endless tar balls. More than anything else, I cannot wait for that to stop.

The crazy thing is that I'm a pretty avid runner. It just doesn't jive well with the smoking. I hated finishing up a 10 mile run, only to hack up the nastiest looking stuff.

When I was younger, most of my friends smoked. Now, most of those people have moved on to other things, and I was left with a few die-hards who basically told me that they have no intention to ever stop. It made me think: is that what I want? The answer is a solid NO!

I've tried to moderate my use many times, but it never worked. I'd always come up with an excuse why NOW was an okay time to smoke, and I could skip the next time. I've always believed in the mantra, ""There is a time and place for almost everything."" The problem was that I was often using marijuana in an inappropriate time and place. I wasn't living up to my own mantra.

My wife has never smoked as much as me, but over the past year, she has started smoking even less. I would smoke more in an evening than she would smoke in a week. I was envious of her and her ability to moderate when I was around her with it all the time. The problem was that I couldn't figure out how to do it too.

So, now I'm done, and it seems easier already than trying to moderate ever was. There is no longer the question: is this an appropriate time to smoke? For me, the only appropriate times to smoke are now in the past. The future holds none. Having this definitive clarity in my mind is helping me. There is no ambiguity.

The #1 thing that I feared about quitting was the insomnia. I've experienced it hardcore every other time I've stopped. But recently, I've been having a lot of insomnia even while smoking. I realized that it couldn't really get worse. And this is what I told myself when I was wide awake at 3am this morning. ""You'd be here anyway even if you were smoking.""

So here I am on day two. I've barely begun, but I feel this inner strength of a resolve to quit. I'm not quitting because anybody told me to. I'm not quitting because I have to. I'm not quitting because I can't find any.

This is 100% because I want to. I know it won't all be easy, but I feel different. I know that what I'm doing is the best thing I can do for my body, my mind, my wallet, and my relationships.

They don't randomly drug test and my position is vital to their success.  I am almost 30 years old.  My dealer moved out of the state to grow legally after the recent laws were passed.

My real challenge is just dealing with life.  Literally everything that I enjoy is something that I do while stoned.  TV, movies, video games, sex, I would even vape up before doing yoga.

* I can relate to the suggestion for night time showers.  They help, but with the aforementioned sweating, I think I am going to need a morning shower as well.

* I was already working out in my daily life routine.

* I rarely slept past 8am because of work.  However even if I woke up at 6am I would vape up and browse reddit until I was late for work.  Being late has no consequences, which further enabled the bad habit

* I have always ate like a horse.  Can't start my day without a 2 scoop whey protein shake, and can't skip lunch or dinner.  After quitting my appetite has decreased.

* I have stopped heavy intake of caffeine.  A triple shot latte was my joint, I've been trying black/green tea instead, and I think it helps.

* I am basically a text book drug addict.  I can't get drunk without later getting high.  As a result I've had to stop drinking all together, which is irritating when going to restaurants or being with my family that drinks.

* My SO does not use, and all of my friends have either quit or are trying to quit.

I would like some tips on meditation.  I understand the principles of controlled breathing, but I don't know when I should meditate and for how long.

I would like any other tips anyone might offer.  I am cautious about trying any sort of over the counter or prescription medication because I feel like it might have the alcohol affect on me and increase my craving by 100x and decrease my willpower by 100x.

Last night I had a few dreams, one that I remember I am suddenly holding onto a wall.  A wall made up of large bricks, with sloppy mortar that allows for holding on.  As soon as I am there, there is a girl next to me, who I know always scales the wall, horizontally.  She says I'm too far out to let go.  I realize this, I'm so high up that falling is certain death.  I worked my way back horizontally on the wall until the ground was closer to my feet.  As I was moving across the wall I noticed some of the bricks were coming loose, and I wondered how the girl could always climb on them, when it was obvious that her climbing is what was making the bricks come loose.

Being an inexperienced leaver, I did not, and still do not know what to expect.

I had been smoking for four years, and my habits slowly got heavier over time, starting with once a month, progressing to every day.

Honestly, up until now it has been much easier than I have anticipated, but there is still a lot to come. It has not all been a walk through the park though. Several times in the last week I have experienced uncomfortable anxiety, and I have never been one to suffer from such a thing. It has also been relatively hard for me to hang out with friends who are smoking, as I feel very left out. I guess its my own fault though...

It hasn't been all bad; I already feel much more clear headed, and I have been focusing more on personal goals that I just didn't seem to have time for before.

Well I am 27 years old and have been using pot Daily for 4 years , before that it was numerous antidepressants for 4 prior years until I fell in love with toking, I honestly feel like I havent been truly sober since my teens and I dont know if I can start now.

The difference between toking and antidepressants was huge for me, I got my medical card in Canada, grabbed a volcano, mflb. started going to the gym, lost 40 pounds. Didnt feel as lethargic, sick, so many things, I felt like I found the wonder drug. Problem is I have no self control, if I buy a bag I smoke it as quick as possible.

I struggle with social anxiety and depression and felt like it was helping me but is no longer now. Problem is that it is something I always turn to when Im mad, sad, hurt. I feel like I have been negating building character. I just smoked the last of my stash. I am not buying more, I am not accepting any from anyone.  I am scared as hell right now of the night sweats, and mental anguish that's coming but It will be worth it.

I'm young, too young for this shit. I'm only 17. I spent the last two years smoking weed in a shit basement with my friends. I began to hate them and all their bullshit. I grew to become a very introverted and self conscious person, which I wasn't before. I was a confident and outgoing kid, didn't really give a fuck what I did. Now I can't do anything without immediately thinking that I was a retard for doing or saying whatever it was. It's led to very bad anxiety.

So two weeks ago I quit smoking weed. I was done for at least the next year, and only then I would return to smoking a few times a month. I was never much of a drinker, but here is how I've progressed since attending parties more often since the beginning of this school year. I started small; a few beers, a shot - a shit ton of weed. It was good, still stand by the idea the weed + alcohol is one the of greatest feelings ever. I then slowly started to drop the weed from my life then suddenly alcohol by itself wasn't the same anymore. I started to get absolutely hammered every weekend. I've been in the hospital more times than I care to admit. Then I started stealing booze from my parents. Drinking by myself. Didn't think much of it, it seemed like I was just smoking a joint by myself. Nothing too out of the ordinary. But then I started feeling dependent on it. Like if I didn't get a drink today it wouldn't be the same.

I'm scared, reddit, I don't have much willpower. I'm going to live with my grandparents for a while in a place where I can't get weed. I will finish up my highschool in which I'm almost an entire grade behind. I need to get my life on track, because weed does NOT make me happy, and that's the bottom line.

I am unemployed, and have only been submitting applications for about 2 weeks. I'm already feeling so defeated. I quit smoking so I could be better prepared for passing any potential drug tests. I did not expect an ethics assessment that asked about past drug use. I answered the questions honestly (including whether I had used shortly before reporting for work). It made me feel so terrible about myself. 

I applied for a job I'd really like this morning. It's a place that I'm sure doesn't care about drug use. I can't get too hung up on any one opportunity, though. This is a numbers game; I have to send out a lot of stuff. (It's reminding me too much of dating, especially online dating, which I did and I hated... but many of us date for the purpose of finding one match. Just one. I can count my blessings that I have found my match.)

I am also wresting with my sate's unemployment office to sort out my benefits, which is also feeling really annoying.

This would all be worse if I was smoking. If I was smoking, I'd have a really hard time getting any applications out, and I'm finding it hard enough as it is. The administrative crap with UI is also so tedious and stressful to me. Why can't it just be right without me having to do anything, making phone calls where I'm on hold for 45 minutes?

I had an open conversation with my partner last night about why this stuff bothers me so much. I always want to put it off. When I was younger, I wouldn't pay my bills on time, until the cable cut off (consequences), and then I'd make the call to get it paid. More recently, before my partner and I lived together, I would put off doing dishes for weeks, until they got really disgusting. Why would I do this? One more day of not doing them didn't have immediate consequences, and I ate out out a lot so I could keep ignoring the mess. *Smoke smoke smoke, watch tv. What dishes? What bills? They can wait. Smoke smoke smoke.*

(Now that we do live together, we made a deal that dishes are his chore, and I do some others that bother me less.)

But our conversation seemed to be circling around these every day administrative stuff we all have to do to get by: chores, bills, following up on stupid crap. It makes me feel really immature that I can't just do it like an adult, like everyone else does. We talked it through, and he said that it's just stuff you have to do, and most of it doesn't take long, so just do it to get out of the way to get to the stuff I would rather spend my time doing. 

That's good advice (though it also sounded like saying to a depressed person to just snap out of it, which I know doesn't help). We tried but really didn't get to the bottom of why this stuff bothers me so much -- but I do know that my smoking made it all easier to ignore, and I can't ignore it anymore, not especially now that the stakes are so high with me being unemployed.

I've been exercising and meditating, and that's been helping. But I still have days like I'm having now where it all feels like too much and I'd rather just go to sleep (an escape replacement from smoking) and pretend it's not there.

TL;DR Coping with life's minutia without being high is really hard. I can't ignore or put off things anymore. I still have urges to escape, but I can't afford to do so right now since I'm currently unemployed.

I've made alot of bad decisions because of weed, including; rifts with family, getting kicked out of high school and treating my girlfriend like shit. I feel like I have a lot of wasted potential, that I could have achieved great things if i'd have stayed clear headed all these years. I'm currently working a reasonably well paid job, but it's so mindnumbingly repetative and boring I'm sure I can achieve better. I've become quiet and introverted and somewhat paranoid, and I know this isn't me deep down. I'm on day 2 right now, experiencing the usual insomnia and lack of appetite, but I'm focused to quit this time. It's just worrying wondering what will fill the void? What am I going to do with all this time i previously spent smoking, and how I'm going to socialze with friends who are mostly ALL smokers (having drifted apart from ones who didn't).

1355817065.0,13,self.leaves,151k22,Almost a year hooked on herbal incense/spice. Can't do it anymore.,spiceburnout,18,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/151k22/almost_a_year_hooked_on_herbal_incensespice_cant/,"I've been wanting to make this post for a long time, but something would always get in the way - usually a spliff to take my mind off why I considered it in the first place.  First off, I know this subreddit is about weed, but I couldn't think of a better place to post it.  I've gotten to a point tonight that I was honestly too frustrated and disgusted with myself to go buy more.  I'm not sure if I'll get any responses here, but I just need to get it out.

For people who don't know, spice/herbal ""incense"" is a legal smokable that you can find in some gas stations or smoke shops.  In my case, there is a smoke shop 15 minutes from my apartment that almost specializes in the stuff.  It gives a 15-30 minute high and then wears off almost as quickly as it came on.

I'm a guy in my early twenties.  Around March of this year, I found myself in a situation where I was being randomly drug tested, so I dropped the weed and started smoking spice.  It wasn't the first time - I had a stint with it in college that lasted a few months.  It became a problem then, too.  At first, it was just a little 1 gram bag.  I took a couple of puffs, felt kind of light and euphoric, and then I would go do something else. I guess we know how this story ends.  It only got worse after that.  The small gram bags turned into 3 gram bags.  Then I saw how I could be saving money by buying lager sizes (""Thirty bucks for ten grams. Hellz yeah! Now I won't have to stock up for a looong time!"" (yeah, right)).

My tolerance went up extremely fast.  I was able to keep it exciting for a while by switching between different brands whenever a certain one wasn't doing it for me anymore.  Within a month or so, I was never feeling the strong euphoric high I did before.  I would just get to a point where I would feel either a light buzz or just get so tired that I would crawl into bed.  The bed was the worst part.  There were days that I would smoke, get tired, lay in bed for 15 minutes, get up, smoke, get tired, lay in bed or 15 minutes, accidentally fall asleep for 2 hours, get up, smoke, etc.  For hours and hours - it's just such an empty way to live.

I've lost god knows how many hours of sleep because I try to stay up and smoke.  I wake up 3 or 4 times during the night, and smoke myself back to sleep.  I've called in sick to work on more than one occasion because ""How sweet would it be to just chill and smoke all day?""  I would feel like a piece of shit or doing it, but that voice would always seem really strong on Monday mornings when I would need to get back into a semi-responsible routine.  I smoke two or three spliffs in the morning, and I always have to fight myself to quit and start getting ready for work.  To everyone at work, I seem totally fine, but when I get home and my work self turns into my burnout self.  It's like I have two totally different personalities, and one comes out promptly at six every day.

Right now, I'm averaging about 3 or so grams per day.  Every time I start almost reaching the bottom of another bag, I start thinking about how badly I want to quit and have a normal life again.  Then, when I officially run out I immediately feel bored and almost panicked, because I'm not sure what to do, or I feel like anything I do to pass the time would be boring compared to smoking, even if I knew that the smoking would only make me tired.

I don't hang out with friends nearly as much as I used to. I have no real serious hobbies to speak of.  I've always been quick to take things too far with spice or weed, and can never find a happy moderation, like everyone else seems to be able to.  I guess I'm hoping that typing this out will give me the motivation that I've been lacking to actually quit for good.  It was hard enough finding the motivation to start.  I ran out earlier today, and was on my way to buy more at about 12:30 am.  Seeing the darkened windows in people's apartments, knowing that they seem to have a normal sleep cycle, and knowing that I was on my way to a seedy porno shop to buy more because it's the only place still open at this hour was enough to make me really feel like a piece of shit and turn around.  This has been my life for almost 9 months now.  I've forgotten what I used to do with my time, and how I used to feel day-to-day without being high.  I want to try to get through this week on my own, then I'll be visiting family until New Year's, so I won't be able to smoke then.  That's how I've been defending my smoking this month - ""After I can't smoke around family for a few days, it'll be easy to stick with it and stop altogether, so I might as well enjoy it for now.""

I'm just god damn sick of it.  I actually had to stop typing this post a few times because I started feeling sick to my stomach reflecting on it.  It's so stupid to be hooked on something like spice.  The fact that I let things get to this point doesn't speak anything great about me, and it's time to start getting my life back.

I'm basically a completely different person than I was three weeks ago as a result of this regime. My memory is better than it was before weed and my cognitive abilities are much, much sharper than they've been for a long time. I would feel like a really terrible person if I didn't at least let you guys know what worked. I'm not trying to push anything on anyone, this is just passing on information.

1) Cardio exercise. I'm on week 3 of a Couch to 10K program, which I do three times a week. I try to get a bunch of walking in on my days off. I plan to slowly build up to exercising a lot more.

2) A nootropic stack. Basically I fixed my nutrition first by using a shake powder called Vega, though I'd imagine there's a bunch of similar stuff on the market, and I try to get in more fruit and veggies, eggs, etc and a multivitamin/multimineral. B vitamins and all the minerals are really important in particular.

But here's the stuff that made the biggest difference:

Piracetam: this is available without a prescription in most supplement stores in the US and is legal for import (for personal use) in Canada, it can easily be ordered in bulk powder form online and is pretty cheap. I'm very responsive to it but some people get better results from the other racetams. I started with 900 mg in the mornings and I now do that amount twice a day with...

Choline: this stuff you need to play with as everyone is different. Some people don't need it at all, some people need just a bit with each piracetam dose and some people need a fuck ton. I take 600 mg with each piracetam dose.

Creatine: 5g in the mornings. Make sure you drink enough water. I'm currently also experimenting with glutamine but as I'm only on day two I can't speak for it yet.

Omega 3 fish oil capsules: I take one with each piracetam dose

L-theanine &amp; Caffeine: right now I just drink two cups of green tea a day which has good ratios of this but most people actually use supplements. L-theanine is spectacular at keeping anxiety at bay and this combo is a good motivator for actually getting shit done. You need more l-theanine than caffeine.

For more nootropic info: /r/Nootropics 

3) Actively working on memory. I recommend www.memrise.com

It's still in beta phase so it can be buggy, but it's the best tool I've ever used. At this point it doesn't matter what you study, just study something. Regular practice is essential to make and keep you sharp. Right now I'm working on a couple of geography courses (capitals, flags, maps, etc) and Swedish vocabulary. This takes me roughly twenty minutes a day in two ten minute blocks. Not that much effort for the drastic improvements I've noticed.

I'm not an active poster, in fact this is my first with this account. If I hadn't experienced such a dramatic improvement, I wouldn't bother. I'm really just trying to share what worked for me. Do your own research and then decide. Nootropics are a VERY experimental field and results very a lot. Piracetam is pretty much as safe as it gets so it's a good place to experiment. Cycling usage works well for some people while others take them all the time.

I'm using my main account because at this point I don't care what my irl friends think. For the rest of you, I go to UCSC which has a very pro-pot mindset. In that pot is used as a social closer as it's an easy way to bridge the gap between stranger to friend. I've been smoking since freshmen year, and it has only ramped up with several months at a time both freshmen,sophomore, and now this year (junior) which I've smoked multiple times a day, everyday. 

I want to quit, or more specifically, I am quitting. Smoking has caused hiccups in my life, some of these hiccups being more serious then others, but what scares me is the change in my life course continuing this habit will cause. It's not a course I want. 

I prided myself in being a functional stoner, getting the grades, the girl, and keeping friends. This is starting to unravel along with control over myself as the habit is creeping up my back like a cloak revealing more and more that it has a life of its own. 

I've tried only doing once a week, only twice a week, only a little every other day (a baby toke), but I (read- not me/myself, but ""I"") would want more. 

I'm scared of this week to come, I'm not physically addicted (I can eat and sleep just fine) but I lack any self motivation/push to do something with myself and this new chance at freedom (read coming to terms with adulthood). I am definitely mentally addicted as beautiful location (and there are many on this campus) evokes the thought of ""this would be a great place to smoke"" and at night I get the urge/itch/desire to just take -one- hit to relax. To ease the fiend that eat me away. 

I'm scared I'll fail. That I wont get my act together. Not ""succeed"" (whatever that is).

So as most of you know, not only do we have a happy, active community here on Reddit, but we also have a growing base over on a website called [Chains](https://chains.cc/groups/jq9BZc3wI7pg3vx). If you've not heard of it, read on. If you *have* heard of it, read on anyway, because this post is for everyone!

Chains is a pretty simple tool for keeping track of your progress day-by-day. You set up a Chain, and for every day that you don't partake you add a link to your chain. You then see a really nice visual representation of how long you've gone without pot, so not only is it a great way to keep track of your progress but it's also quite a powerful psychological tool - it's hard to explain, but you begin to feel accountable to your personal 'chain' in a very tangible way.

Sound good? Head on over to [Chains](https://chains.cc) and get that shit set up. Once you've done that, feel free to join the r/leaves group where there are already over 30 members. A quick glance at everyone's 'chains' reveals that many people are making great progress.

**However...** the problem is, it's not obvious that everyone is updating their chain. If you miss a day, then nobody else knows whether it's because you've smoked a bowl or simply not got round to filling it in. Hence the need for this ""Chains Tuesday"" post, which will hopefully become a regular thing (JoshTay started things off last week, so if there's any volunteers who want to do an update next week please leave a comment).

Don't get me wrong - if you've smoked up, then obviously don't just fill in the days regardless. That's the whole point. You get to see your longest 'run' and will hopefully feel the need to better yourself. And don't for a second think that this Chains Tuesday is for calling people out who've slipped up. Everyone knows that's not what r/leaves is about.

This post is simply a reminder to check your chain and update if necessary, so that there's an accurate picture of everyone's progress.
 
Does that sound good to everyone?

EDIT: Sorry, forgot to mention. If you've just signed up for Chains but have stopped smoking before today, you can retroactively update your chain.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,1349211365.0,,,True,t3_10tgqc,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/10tgqc/chains_tuesday/,
1349076987.0,14,self.leaves,10r2yx,Made a big move last weekend. Burned my bridge to Kush Mountain.,Bledrosoft,14,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/10r2yx/made_a_big_move_last_weekend_burned_my_bridge_to/,"This is more a journal entry to myself, but I thought it might be motivational for some here.

I'm 21, have been a pot smoker for the last 2-3 years (college), and have always been fairly moderate with my usage. Sometimes smoking only the weekends, sometimes vaping every day--I'd say I vaped every other day of this year. I went through a half-eighth a week at most. I have always given myself reassurance that I'm not ""one of them,"" since I have friends who smoke much larger amounts than me. But the fact that these thoughts occurred on a DAILY basis, especially when I was high, was always something that I refused to be bothered by. I certainly felt like stopping many, many mornings that I woke up, only to vape again night after night.

Last Sunday night, after two WHOLE days of not smoking weed, I watched this youtube video out of vague interest: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2J0t39_IpAE&amp;feature=watch-vrec

Towards the end of the video, I had an intense desire to go flush my weed. Get rid of it all. Finally. Once and for all, make a final ""goodbye"" to my stuff. Well, I did. I pulled my ""stash box"" out of the back of my closet, and put EVERYTHING in my room that was related to weed in my box--mason jars, grinder, papers, vaporizer, and put my bowl in my back pocket. I flushed a full eighth of weed down the toilet. It occurred to me how ""legit"" of a stoner I had become as far as my ""gear"" looked. A large box full of paraphernalia goodies.

I walked a few minutes to the interstate, stash box in hand, and chucked it deep into a bush. It was a weird feeling--after releasing the box, it was like the recoil of a powerful shotgun. ""OH. I just did that."" Then, I walked over to the bridge of the interstate. I took my bowl out of my pocket, and chucked it against the wall. A satisfying shattering sound. It was really beautiful.

I have now been sober and feeling clearer for a week now. It's quite a different feeling than my other 'breaks' in the past. I don't have my tools waiting for me when I feel 'ready' in 1-3 weeks. This is for real. I am not smoking weed for a long time, not until I have overcome the hole I feel from its long presence. I have finally acknowledged that I owe no allegiance to pot, and that my pieces and stuff are not a part of my identity. This is why I did not keep any of it. That was the very thing holding me back.

Some regrets flashed through my mind over the next few days, such as:

-Why didn't I sell some of that stuff?
-What if I never smoked again? Weed has opened my mind! I need it on some basis.
-WHY did I flush my weed?! I love weed!

To the first point: I consider it the best $200 I've ever thrown away. I don't have to deal with someone else having my burden, I just ridded it from myself completely.

To the second point: I will surely smoke again in my life, but it will not be the same thing that it is now. It won't be something that I take ownership of. And I think I need about a year to move on from this. Sort of like the girlfriend rule (half the time you dated, remain single).

To the third point: Just the weed talking. I love life, not weed. Though, I still get this thought and am tempted by its logic. Weed isn't bad, but I have made it into a crutch in my life. So I keep reassuring myself that I do need to stay away from it.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_10r2yx,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/10r2yx/made_a_big_move_last_weekend_burned_my_bridge_to/,
1348770276.0,15,self.leaves,10kpgt,I could use some support.  Today will be Day 1.,Petra-Arkanian,18,3,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/10kpgt/i_could_use_some_support_today_will_be_day_1/,"For quite a while now, I have not enjoyed cannabis.  Somewhere around six months ago, something snapped.  Every time I get high, I get incredibly anxious, irritable, and start doubting everything in my life.  Every time I get high, I think to myself, ""I hate this and I'm never doing it again.""  Two hours later when the high starts to wear off, I'm packing another trench.

Many times I've said that I want to stop.  As many of you know, this is easier said than done.  Even though cannabis makes me miserable, I can't stop toking.  It's practically a reflex.  Get home from a long day of work/school?  Vape.  Lazy Sunday afternoon with my boyfriend?  Vape.  Bored?  Vape.  Not bored, but feeling incomplete?  Vape.  Anxious and upset?  Vape to make myself feel better and end up feeling even worse.

I can't keep living my life like this.  I work full-time (obviously my job isn't that demanding as I'm on reddit right now, but it has some busy days) and go to school in the evenings.  Rather than studying on my days off, as soon as I get home from work I pack up a trench.  Instead of exercising or spending quality time with my boyfriend, I get high.

I feel absolutely pathetic.  I always figured that if I got addicted to something, it would be something serious like heroin.  Not something generally innocuous like cannabis.  I feel weak for not just being able to stop.

Obviously quitting cannabis will entail some life changes.  I'll have to ask my boyfriend to change his smoking habits (I know that his using cannabis around me would be a trigger), which makes me feel incredibly selfish.  I know I'll have to avoid certain acquaintances.  Change scares everyone, but I am particularly terrified by it.

Despite all of the negative qualities of my experience with cannabis, I keep justifying it.  Now is the time.  I need to stop.  Any words of advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated.

Actually I'm feeling pretty exhausted. But I feel good about working through this without smoking. I got home late tonight and realized there wasn't much in the way of food so I was really worried about what I was going to eat. I expected my lady to have made plans for dinner, but it turned out she had a really hard day as well. I was pretty disappointed at first but eventually I listened to her and I started to understand.

If I had smoked and drank beer when I got home like I would have done any other day for the last several years, I probably would not have listened to my lady, gotten very upset with her and not eaten much for dinner. Then I would have gone to bed in some twisted up position and woken up feeling like shit. But tonight I did my best to be there for my lady and then I got up and went back out of the house and bought something for us to eat and we cooked it together and it was really really good.

When I feel the urge to smoke, or just feel upset in general (closely related with the urge to smoke), I try to rephrase the feeling as a question.

When I think, ""Man I really wish I could smoke"" I catch myself and say ""Do you really wish you could smoke?"" By listening to the question with some sincerity I can answer the question with sincerity instead of having a more automatic reaction, ""No, I don't really wish I could smoke. It's not going to make me feel good about myself. It's not going to give me what I want and it's not going to help me grow in the ways I care most deeply about."" 

When I think, ""Man, I posted that stupid link on facebook. That comment was so cruel. But they were right it was a fucking stupid link. And that reminds me of about 1000 other stupid things I've done. Number 1..."" I try to catch it before it goes on too long, ""Do you really believe you are stupid, dull, boring, run of the mill, worthless, incomplete...?"" No!! I cannot accept this!! I cannot commit to this!! I may have gotten wrapped up in feeling that way for a while but let's consider some other feelings. What about complete, whole, fulfilled, serene, balanced, caring, natural, helpful, courageous, intelligent, curious, attentive...

Somehow reformulating the feelings as questions helps me from getting too wrapped up with them. Well, I have been getting wrapped up with them many times today, but the feelings by themselves do not have the power to spiral out of control. My willingness to grow and progress is not balanced on the head of a pin. It is something very natural and deeply part of me. The urge to smoke and the upset feelings just keep coming up but they don't necessarily have anything to do with who I really am.

I have been taking time whenever possible to be aware of the richness that comes continuously and for free with being alive. I try to have some humility and put my self-centered thoughts aside and I try to watch, listen, observe, and after a little while or sometimes a long while I am struck by something very inspiring. I can't say what it is because it is different every time...

Ran across this sub last night while looking for quitting tobacco resources (more on this in a moment) and I thought I'd share my story with you all. It may help.

I've been a quarter-a-week smoker for almost 17 years and I've recently lost my job. At first, I whined, I begged, I borrowed and I managed to keep myself stoned (I even considered selling it)...but eventually, money ran out, friends stopped coming by and, after last Tuesday, the supply (and my finances for said supply) ran out entirely. It is admittedly difficult to spend $300 a month on pot when you don't have $300 a month that isn't spoken for already.

I was pretty scared at first - I was actually going to have to deal with myself and my boredom. Terrifying stuff, honestly. My girlfriend would leave me, I thought, because she wouldn't want to deal with the intensity. I'm a pretty book-smart guy and lengthy dissertations on the efficiency of coffee pot placement in relation to the kitchen sink, for example, tend to put people off.

But that isn't at all what happened.

Yes, my circadian clock about wound itself down the street and out the door. Last Tuesday, after getting back from my friend's house, I was pretty trashed...but I didn't just fall asleep like I usually do. I was up all night and into the next day. Usually, I'll smoke a bowl before bed, but in the absence of a bowl to smoke my brain sort of fed back on itself and I just spent the next day sort of half in bed and half not. When I finally did sleep, I slept for about three hours. This continued on until today, when I managed to get a solid 8 hours of sleep in and woke up at 4 this afternoon. Of course, it's now 5am and I'm sitting on Reddit, but that will balance out in time, I'm sure.

One of the things I noticed starting around Day 3 or so was that I was more aware of the state my life has been in and painfully aware of how I smoked so I didn't have to look at it. I always thought I was ""The Enhancement Smoker,"" but these last few days have shown me something a lot more insidious: I smoked to avoid dealing with my problems.

The problems are still there, of course -- they don't magically go away when you quit something. But I am now able to clearly see what steps I need to take to resolve them and move on with my life. College, a haircut, a clean apartment - these were things that seemed out of reach or undesirable before. I want these things badly now. Very badly.

College is the big one...I'm in my 30's and I decided after high school that I would rather get a shitty job and lay around smoking pot and playing games than actually point my brain at something useful and helpful for others. Who needs college when you already have a job? What a mistake that was! 

My girlfriend and I had a long talk about everything last night (she doesn't smoke), and she told me that all of the changes she's seen in the last few days have been positive. All of them. I actually want to leave the house now once in a while. I feel like I **can** find a part-time job to help her out with the bills until I get to college (Winter Quarter, baby, yeah!), and I can probably even keep that job while I'm there (or find one that will work with me and my schedule). Passing that first drug test on my own merits is going to be freaking awesome. I'm generally more motivated and actually want things more than I can ever remember. It feels good.

I love gaming and I was really afraid that I wouldn't even want to bother with it anymore...but I've been hammering away just as though I were knee-deep in a bag of grass, except without the bag of grass. Quitting didn't change who I was at all - in fact, my reaction time has improved by about a third! No bullshit!

And smoking cigarettes...before, I didn't give a shit if I smoked or not. She'll keep buying them for me, no questions asked - they're cheap enough. Last night, I decided that this would be the first monkey I strangled and sent to the Zoo of Shame. I [have a plan now](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/10c9lb/lets_do_this/) and I am taking steps to eliminate tobacco from my life completely. Unfortunately, the ashtray I use is an antique - but that is no reason to keep it. I'm sure someone else could use it; I won't want to see it again after I quit. And I will be keeping a non-Bic lighter around for lighting incense (can't smoke pot with it - makes me sick as hell). Maybe a Zippo. Try smoking a bowl with one of those! :p

I haven't had a funeral for my weed stuff yet...I have two extremely beautiful glass pieces and a glass graveyard for all of those fallen brothers of yore. I will probably gift the glass pieces to friends who still smoke and toss the glass graveyard in the dumpster. The graveyard is in a really nice oak chest and I know I can find something else to use it for.

Will I lose the few friends I have left? They all smoke...but a real friend won't judge me on the basis of whether or not I smoke pot. I don't *hate* pot...it's just not right for me...and I promised myself that I wouldn't judge them for their choices. I will ask them to respect mine, however, and not smoke in front of me or offer it to me (or come around blazed out of their minds). I haven't told anyone but my girlfriend and now you guys, and I imagine it will come as quite a shock. I've always been the biggest stoner of the group. If someone doesn't respect my decision...I'll say it here and now and in bold: **FUCK EM**. Of course, this will be after I ask myself whether I even want to be friends with them anymore, or why I was even friends with them in the first place. Maybe I can make some new friends.

I guess what I'm saying here is that I did it and I know you can do it, too. I was in a bad freaking place with pot and only by putting the pipe down was I able to objectively see it for what it was. It was a crutch to help me deal with the fear of being a person...and that is bullshit.

I sincerely hope this post helps someone else. If you have any questions for me at all, please feel free to ask them.

Occasional use, 2-6 times a month. In a year or so I began smoking daily. Not long after that, I misguidedly made the switch first to pure JWH-073 (which was fine) and then to gas-station Spice. I felt an addiction building (I'd sneak my girlfriend's stash when she wasn't home), but I never got it bad like several of my friends (3g/day habits, seizures, constant nausea, panic attacks). Switched back to weed, the whole episode being about six months.  

Three years later, I've never had a sobriety break longer than 3-4 days at most and I've decided my girlfriend and I need to save some money and go out more, so we're taking a 30-day break and seeing where it goes. I was your typical stoner, shitty short term memory, lazy, antisocial. Smoked about a quarter a month to myself.  

It's day 12, and I feel completely normal. The only things I've noticed since quitting are that I get bored again, and my stomach actually has a reasonable capacity now. No longer compelled to eat and snack constantly. I never gained any weight from it, but it wasn't healthy.

But the title says it all, pretty much. I've been a near-daily smoker for roughly 5 years, and I say near-daily because the longest break in that span was about 3 weeks. I've decided to take a break from toking until I'm more on my own two feet, so to speak. 

A little backstory: in high school I was very success-oriented, worked my ass off at a few part time jobs, building a respectable savings account for someone my age. School was always on the back burner for me, I was smart enough to get good grades without applying myself fully. Had I done that, I probably would have had *great* grades and gotten more in scholarship money, but I digress. 

Anyway, about halfway through senior year I smoked up with some friends for my first time. It was great, *""how had I never tried this?!""* I thought. So I did it again a couple weeks later. And then again a few days later. And before I knew it I was in college and could smoke daily-- so why shouldn't I? I had convinced myself that weed was such a non-issue for me, when in reality it has likely been a crutch for me since it was a subconscious way to escape responsibility (school still wasn't difficult, but if I hadn't been smoking the entire time I would have a lot more to show from my college career).

I haven't had a job since high school, being too afraid to interview for anything in case they drug tested. But a job hasn't been a necessity for me yet; my college was paid for (grants, scholarships, and a little help from family). Thankfully I've been able to sustain my living situation off my savings and my housing was paid for by my grandparents as their way of saying they were happy I'd chosen the school they had in mind. 

I've recently started working again (self-employed) and I'm in my final semester of college, and I know I can't afford to waste any time smoking weed until I'm responsible enough to do so without taking money from my grocery budget. The hard part for me is the fact that the majority of my friends still smoke, and I don't want to be the person that severs all ties over the use (or non-use) of a plant. I also don't want to think that smoking has defined our friendship, but I guess I'll know the truth in the coming weeks. 

I feel like proving to myself that I can quit would go a long way for me; I want it to be a first step in bettering myself and getting back to my old, motivated, driven, self again. So I guess this is goodbye ""smokebowls420"", hello senorbluesky.

I apologize for the wall of text, but I needed to get a lot of that off my chest and if I can't do it here then I'll never do it at all. Thanks for reading, I look forward to any advice or pointers for someone who's new to quitting. 

**TL;DR** Quitting until I do a little growing up. Work and school are my main priorities right now and I could use a clear head as I move forward with both.

I'll keep the post short and simple: This is my 2nd time quitting and my first reason for going back was my lack of sleep. I find myself up to ridiculous hours without any way of passing out on time. Last night, I went to bed at 12:30 AM and didn't pass out until 4:00 AM. 

So basically (as ridiculous as it sounds), does anyone have any sleeping tips for sleeping sober? And does it get better?

EDIT: So last night I attempted to go to sleep at 12:45 AM. I spent the first two hours trying to sleep normally (to no avail), then I tried reading, then tried showering, then tried counting, then tried going for a walk. By 6:15 AM, I still had zero hours of sleep.

I wanted to avoid doing this, but CVS opens at 7 AM; I'll be getting melatonin then.

I have had a lot of fun and great experiences while being high with friends and never thought it would hamper my life. I started smoking my first year of college. Since then my life has changed. Looking back on my decision making in the past, I can see how weed didn't ruin my life but just put it on pause. I had to leave the university I was attending because I never went to class, or did my homework, and it is because I felt like hanging out and playing video games and getting high was the most important thing to do at the time. I then had to go back home and live with mom and dad and go to a community college. I now live on my own with my brother and still trying to finish my college career. The only problem is trying to be a responsible student and at the same time, have a good time being high with friends. Juggling these two has always been hard, and I thought that if it was hard to do, then it was worth it ( like quit smoking weed lol ). Well I was wrong. I was making my life harder than it should be. I could not remember easy simple stuff because my memory was shot. School wasn't the only thing. 
I have always been a person who hated addiction. I use to smoke cigarettes and it always got to me that I felt compelled to go out and waste money on something that kept me at a normal baseline level, but at the same time was hindering my body. Keeping that in mind helped me quit, it was rough, but I got though it. Weed is similar but different. I don't like the fact that if I don't smoke I become on edge and little irritated. That mixed in with that I don't feel comfortable when high anymore. I feel like I have lost focus and that I am dumb. When I get high I get nothing really done in real life. Some times I find myself pacing back and forth, trying to do 3 things at once and not getting any of them done. 
So for the last couple of days I have tried to just quit for a day. Start small I thought and work your way up. Well let's just say that I have failed everyday this last week. I have smoked less, meaning everytime I did smoke I hit the bowl once or twice and that was it, thinking I was weening myself down. But before I go to bed I get lost in a storm of regret. Then I start telling myself. tomorrow you are going to actually do it. HA! wrong I was ( sry for the yoda talk). Well leaves I will do it today. Consider it done. I was going to say I was going to try, but trying never really works, so I am just going to do it. Reading others post on here has helped, and I know me typing this and submitting it, doesn't mean I am go to go, and I will never smoke again, but it does help to get all the stuff going on in my mind out, and having a chance to discuss these with others going through the same thing.

6am - woke up, fuck this...too tired, mentally and physically drained.  No motivation, no will to do anything.  Anxiety is at a DGAF level.  Was nice to wake up without a burning throat or burning taste in my mouth and instead just have stinky morning breath.  Noticed my teeth are getting brighter and less yellow....not so much whiter, just brighter.  Cleaner.

6:30am - drink a pot of coffee, take my meds, head out the door to meet with some friends before the exam. anxiety low, mind foggy from being tired and drained from the 4.5hour exam last night.  Moving slow.  Skating feels sluggish, feel mad sore all over.  

8am - take exam, exhausted, so tired, hard to think, but at least I can think.  Feel alright about the exam, cant say I will do great, but I wont fail at the very least.

9pm - got back to my apt...I want to nap, but this is my first free 'me' time ive had in about a month and a half.  Im scared that I may relapse, using the excuse, oh you just did all that hard work, you deserve it. I don't deserve shit.  Don't have the energy to move.

9:30am - itching to smoke, but too tired, too drained to work out.  Feel slightly sick to my stomach but that could just be the 4 cups of coffee and donut i had this morning.  Lights feel really bright...I want to nap....want to sleep....ADD meds wont allow a good rest though.  Need to wake up before I drive tonight.  Will be the first time driving without smoking something, usually will have a joint or a cig while driving, no, I always have something while driving.  Guess Ill just have to jam out to ska or something.

10am - still no energy, havent moved from my chair....trying to find the energy to either run myself into the ground or wake the hell up.  Want to smoke...got nothing else to do.  &lt;----cant let that happen.  going to run myself into the ground.

10:15 - little things are pissing me off.  Cant get a book to stand up on its own. about 5 mins away from throwing shit across the room and breaking stuff.  Need to move. patience getting low.  

11:25am - lots of anger, lots of emotion behind this work out.  Felt a lot of power coming to me as I pushed myself as hard and as fast as I could.  Every craving, every want, every thought I pushed out of my mind and out of my body.  Energy is back to normal level.  

11:30am - showered feel much much much better.  Anger and paitence back to normal levels.  can think clearly and calmly.  Focusing on keeping my day slow, I do not have as much to occupy myself now that classes are done for a bit.  Making sure every craving or want is properly dealt with and not just pushed aside.  Breaking it down into why I would want to and why I shouldn't.  The reason 'you were spitting blood and you need to breath' is whats keeping me on track so far.  

11:45am - Updated.  Hungry. Mellow mood.  Would play some video games, but its the day that my game updates. (10pts to whoever can guess what game im talking about...I know there are gamers out there who hate tuesday mornings as much as I do! :P)

1pm - throat bothering me a bit, dont know why.  Drank some water and it still hurts...almost sore.   

1:24pm - throat stopped bothering me.  

2pm - finally eating breakfast or lunch whatever.  Feeling good, minds clear.  Noticing a lot of little things in my room.  And am a lot more in touch with my body.  Playing video games sober is interesting, but I do have to say already the stuff I found difficult high is pretty damn easy now.  Figuring out what to do a lot quicker.  Lot less uhhhhh and ummms in my head.  

4pm - craving a joint bad.  Video games are easy as hell, no problem avoiding damage or dishing it out.  Want to smoke something anything. Pushing it off a little longer....sweating a bit, but the apt is warm and I am running all my electronics hard.  So I disregard the warmth as being nothing other than that.  Tired, but its a mellow tired. Mind is feeling slow, like the type of mellow I used to look for high.  My mind is usually racing with thoughts and images (ADD) so this is weird...haven't meditated just relaxing.  

5:30pm - aside from almost getting hit by someone not paying attention to the stop signs (yeah, their excuse I DIDNT KNOW YOU WERE A CAR?  what...how...how does that change anything?)  I ran into a buddy who I used to blaze with.  They are the exact person I need to avoid.  Told them my deal and how I was spitting blood and they merely said oh you should just vape.  I got out of that situation as quickly as possible making up some excuse like having to pack.  *shrugs* Oh well.  Moral of this update.  JUST SAY NO!  I know it sounds lame, but really, thats all it takes. Simple no and walk away.  May be hard, may seem like an asshole but i got people who arent supporting me. Fuck THEM.  Ill take my health over a stoney friendship.  I am starting a drive down to see a close friend.  will update as soon as possible.

Too much to time it so a summary of yesterday after 5pm

Driving was so much better sober without anything.  I was able to really drive and not just coast along.  Was my driving more reckless because I felt more sure of my actions. YES. Got to my friends place late. They smoked while I drove us to Subway.  First time smelling or being in the presence of weed since I quit....Can't say I didn't Itch for a toke, but I rolled down the window and turned up the music drowning out my senses instead.


Day 3 complete.  


On a side note.  Last night I was able to pass off my pipe, papers, roller, etc etc to a couple friends who I know will take good care of it, and respect it as their own (which I guess it is now).  I did hold onto one device, but it cannot be used in its current sate (missing a key part) and I am going to save it so that I can give it to my close close friend who I know will appreciate it and take care of it and at the very least get some good use out of it.  I know I know Im enabling others, but really they don't have a problem, they arent spitting blood or spending every hour of every day blazed.  Im sad to see it go, but its time for it to happen anyway.    

Side note 2.  I realized I have no smelled, or sensed any bud being smoked...this is very rare.  I can smell bud from a mile away and I haven't even gotten a trace.  I live in a college town with a couple frat type deals nearby.  Bud is usually in the air.  Maybe i have just blocked myself from smelling it?  Who knows....wonder what it will be like to smell it and know I can't have it.

Unless my performance significantly improves I will be fired.

I'm a very well-liked person within the agency. My clients love me. I have contributed ideas that have led to significant successes.

I, however, cannot effectively manage ""the details."" I'll send out reports with the wrong dates, I'll capture notes incorrectly, or I'll forget to follow up on something.

While I don't think I'm a ""details oriented"" person to start with, I can't help but think that smoking weed has hurt me.

I'm 24 now and have been smoking since I was 18, and fairly regularly for the last 4 years. I don't have any deep-seeded issues that I try to cover up with weed, but I always thought of smoking weed as my challenge-
I always have tried to see if I can be successful in challenging environments while smoking weed. In college I would toke up before some of my most difficult classes and do really well. Now obviously I don't smoke before I go to work anymore, but I still smoke 3-5 times a week at night and pretty heavily over the weekend.

It's apparent that I cannot continue with this idea that that I love- being a successful, fully-functional stoner. It's a contradiction, and a retarded idea at that.

So I'm going to try and regain some of my cognitive abilities by not smoking. It will be somewhat of a challenge because a portion of my friends smoke (and now that I think about it, all of them are burnouts), but they are good friends and won't give me any issues. I'm a pretty dedicated individual as well.

So I think I was just looking to get this in writing, and I'm not sure what kind of feedback I'm looking for, but I'd love to hear any thoughts (or confidence-boosters).

Time for an update I guess,

So I began my journey this January, My catalyst was getting myself on Academic Probation last quarter. I fucked up real bad by failing two classes. So I decided that I would take a break this entire quarter.

The results: I ended up with a 3.67 this quarter. I would be on the Dean's List if I hadn't been accepted into a combined Bachelors/Masters program this quarter. I'm starting to feel really great. I still don't know if I'll quit forever since it still feels like a huge decision.  However, I feel like I'm close to quitting for good. 

A few problems remain. My marijuana use lead to my use of harder drugs such as Cocaine and Adderall (Amphetamine). I've never had a really consistent problem with these harder drugs, but I do use them occasionally. I hope to stop using these drugs soon as well.  

Like I said earlier, its really hard to make the decision to quit for good. I live with 6 other guys that smoke regularly. So far I haven't had a problem quitting temporarily, however, I'm not sure how quitting forever will go. I really don't see myself not being around marijuana constantly, as I'm still in college with several friends that still smoke. Does anyone have experience with a situation like this?

Anyway, 3 months in feels great.  I'm about close to the longest time I've spent not smoking (I took 3 months of last Spring). My goal is to go at least 6 months then see how I feel. Keep it up fellow r/leaves subscribers. You guys give me motivation every day to keep going. I love hearing your struggles. It makes me feel human and it gives me something to relate to.

My therapist told me about [SMART recovery](http://www.smartrecovery.org/). I really appreciated their emphasis on self-motivation and self-reliance, in addition to their science based approach. Has anyone else been through this program that could give a review or two?

I am also noticing that I have a lot of trouble staying focused on things, even when not smoking. I'll be saying something and I'll just lose my train of thought mid-sentence.

So I think I'm going to have to quit trees for the first time in well over a year of smoking every night. But it seems to be a hobby now, I go home from work and just spark up. How can I overcome this mental dependence on it?
Should I give it all away or try to ease off of it? Trees helps me sleep since I have really bad anxiety and it just calms me down. But my ""professional"" life has to come first so I can keep a roof over my head.

I'm not even sure what's going to be in this box by the time I'm done, I just have so much shit bouncing around in my head right now... I've started suffering panic attacks daily almost a week ago.  I didn't know what they were at first.  I'm asthmatic, but smokinig weed has never really bothered me...smoking cigarettes was a different story, but I was just lying there and I suddenly just couldn't get enough oxygen.  No matter how hard I tried.  That sent me into a spiral literally thinking I was dying.  My pulse was fast and then slow, my lungs were freaking out, I was hyperventilating while feeling like I was slowly suffocating. 

I've had ""I dun smoked too much of this really good weed and my heart and brain are freaking out"" moments before.  I'm always able to breathe my way out of it, but this was different.  I almost went to the hospital, but I'm in like the bottom 1% so the fear of how I'd fucking pay for it won out in the end and I just tried to go to sleep...

I didn't know what the cause was.  I'm still getting over a wicked cold so I thought maybe that was affecting my respiratory abilities somehow.  I managed to fall asleep and felt fine the next day, so I sort of dismissed it.  But then it happened again that day.  And the next, and so on.  

A little background. I smoked/drank/snorted/popped everything I could get my hands on between the ages of 18 and 24.  Coke, opiates, booze, weed...everything and anything.  I ended up homeless and in rehab.  Fast forward 3 years.  All of the depression and anxiety I'd been fighting against with all of that ""medicine"" started to creep in little by little after I sobered up.  April of this year I spent alone in my apartment.  I didn't leave unless I absolutely had to.  I didn't have to work, so I didn't.  I didn't do anything but cower alone.  Then a co-worker started smoking a little here and there for the first time in a long time.  I joined him and quickly noticed a change.  I almost immediately went back to being a daily smoker.  Practically overnight, I changed.  I started riding my bike to work instead of taking the bus.  (Lost 20 pounds)  I started hanging out with people I hadn't seen in years.  I, a *chronic* nail biter (I'm talking until my fingers bled, then I'd bite them more) stopped biting my nails completely.  Everything got better, instantly.

That was 9 months ago and here I am now.  Even without the panic attacks, I know weed was starting to not work anymore... my anxiety (obviously) has started returning and my miracle drug has run it's course.  I haven't smoked for 24 hours and intend to keep it that way... 

I don't know that I have anything to ask.  Or tell.  Or say.  I just needed to get this in writing somewhere and I appreciate anyone taking the time to read it.  Any advise you have, I'm listening.  In the meantime I'm just looking for a friend to help in this time of great uncertainty...

A couple weeks before I quit I went to an MA meeting (somewhat unrelated). The people there seemed to all be NA people with larger problems than mine ([Case in point, clip from 'Half-Baked'](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWQM6sOsd5k)). I didn't give my story as I was still in the mind that I could control what I'm doing. For the last year or so I've smoked about .5 gram a day, but I've smoked on and off for 15+ years. I guess I am quitting because I don't want to need anything. Tonight is very difficult. I could easily go get some herb and feel a lot happier and actually be interested in something. I feel isolated and depressed. Perhaps I was depressed when I was smoking, but at least that seemed to make me happy. I didn't leave to fill my jar because my SO said some very conflicting things that made it clear she wanted me to quit.


I live in a state where I could easily get a MJ card and it is really cheap. So money isn't really an issue. I don't owe anyone money. I don't treat anyone badly and I don't have social anxiety issues. My 'provider' is a nice lady that trades her chicken eggs for it and then sells it to me. I actually miss going to see her.


I noticed after I stopped that I have a lot more back pain than I have ever realized so I went to get acupuncture and the practicitioner gave me Ardisia 16 (jin niu cao ton shen pian) a chinese patent medicine that she said would help with cravings. I am now just super depressed and dread the idea of slogging through another day at work. I feel I don't really have anything in the short term to look forward to (although today I made a great connection to start volunteering at a place I am very interested in).

I telecommute to a job very far away from my home and I really only have one night a week where I'm out doing something (in a big band). It's not effected my performance at my job, except that I seem to be more interested in things when I am smoking. 

I really don't know what to say, but I had to say something. I want to smoke. It would make me immediately happy. I might enjoy doing something for the rest of the evening, instead I'm watching hulu with a scowl on my face until it is 10pm so I don't wake up ridiculously early.

**TL;DR   I want to smoke the herb and feel better. I don't owe money or hurt anyone or have horrible negative consequences due to my habit. I'm just depressed.**

[ edit 11.05.11 still clean. I stopped taking the Ardisia 16 because I felt it was making me more depressed in a way. I can't tell you how or why, but I felt a lot better not taking it.

I was in high school, then college, and then a year out of college before I got promoted to a point to where it was no longer worth it to risk getting tested and losing my job. So 6 weeks ago I intentionally smoked myself into a [10]+ freakout and then gave my stash and supplies to a couple of my good friends.

I've approached quitting with a non-permanent attitude; I know I'm eventually going to have a job where I don't get tested, or even where I'm working for myself, and I have such a fond appreciation for cannabis that I could never swear it off forever. As it is, I am simply prioritizing my life in order to make the soundest decisions *that will set me up the best in the future*. I'm saving money, working incredibly hard in order to get promoted out of the testing pool, and improving my life in other areas so when I finally get back to smoking I'll appreciate it more than I ever did.

Not only that, but I am slowly and methodically collecting the coolest cannabis-related items ever. I bought a standing ash-tray at a thrift store last week, a vintage ash tray that looks like a spiky orange Death Star, and am on the look out for the ultimate designer piece. That way I don't disconnect from the culture and am prepared for when I finally come back. :)

I know some of you want to quit forever -- if that's the case, then this post probably isn't for you. But for those of you who want to quit for a while to prove something to yourself, or to somebody else, or just to save some money, just create a future worth working towards.

I think it's awesome what you're doing, and I want to apologise for my behaviour in the past.  I was the dude who made fun of the idea of cannabis addiction, because I didn't think it was a real thing.  I changed, though, and you can help more people like me change too.

It happened about 10 or 11 years ago, at a party in high school.  I had rolled up a big ol' blunt, and was asking around to make sure I didn't leave anyone out.  Someone said something like ""Hey, you should ask Chad, I think he smokes.""  So I did, and he said no thanks, he was trying to quit.  I incredulously asked him why, and he said his grades had dropped.  Instead of just leaving it at that, I got into a debate with him about whether cannabis could be addictive, and basically tried to cajole him into smoking with us (""well, do you have an exam tomorrow? then what difference does it make?"").

He called me out on my bullshit.  I don't recall the exact words, but the gist of it was, ""Look, you don't know what my personal experience is, and right now you're being an asshole.  Would you be hassling someone who was trying to lose weight to eat cheesecake?""

Of course, he was dead right.  The fact that he was right hit me like a ton of bricks, and I couldn't believe how I had been acting.  But for some reason, it took a person like him calling me out on my shit bring me to that realization.  

So please, don't put up with bullshit like that if someone tries to pull it on you.  Assert your right to your own experiences.  I'm still a happy toker, but I respect anyone who isn't happy with their toking, and I make an effort not to try to involve them or offer them pot.

I know there are others who say they are one week in and struggling, but I thought that because I'm not a full time smoker I'd be one of the ones feeling positive. But right now I feel pretty crap. 

Honestly, the only reason why I made it through the week is because my hook ups have been dry. I've been finding excuses as to why it would be alright to smoke. Get this: my latest was that because the first episode of the new season of Breaking Bad was out, it would probably be fun to get high and watch it because it'll be so much better than if i watched it sober.

It never works. 

I also had decided to quit smoking darts. That has come to an end also after about 5 days. I feel so disappointed in myself, because my failure to quit has made me feel like I have 0 self control. Even my best mate said I was pathetic when I told him I was going out to buy a pack of ciggs. 

I was looking at photos of myself that were taken only about a year ago, and I looked great. Seriously, I was in great shape, high grades, happy life.

I will update you by the week on how it goes, this is my very first and very last attempt to quit everything and start life basically again.  If i will not fail, I believe i will succeed in life and in this journey!

I am forever quitting and leaving behind:
Marijuana,
Alcohol,
Masterbaiting,
Computer, (1 hour max / day)
Phone, (15 mintues total max / day)
Caffeine, (energy drinks, pepsi, coffee)
Tobacco, Chewing and Smokin

I don't believe this has been done before, or at least, very regularly.  I know it's going to be difficult but hey, why not give it a try, right?  My main motive for all of this is to live in the moment, this generation of kids, youths, even adults, are growing up in a state where their heads are down on there phone, where time spent with the family, well, their really is no time for the family when we are usually too focused on our computers, where we numb our pain with alcohol, and drugs, and feel we it to enjoy life.  I am only 19 years old, very confident in myself and in everything i do, and optimistic about life, and very dedicated in what i'm about to do.  So wish me the best of luck ladies and gentleman!

I've been struggling to quit for probably a year. Each time I will go about one to two weeks before going right back to smoking every night. I always rationalize my reason for smoking again, then I just get a ""fuck it"" attitude before I realize why I need to quit. 

The thing is, I only smoke at night, and not even very much. I will take two or three hits and that is all, but I have to do it every night. When I started smoking 5 years ago, it was such a great anxiety relief and boredom killer. I thought it was the greatest thing ever. Now after 5 years of smoking everyday, I feel stuck. I have a terrible memory, my anxiety is worse, and I can't get motivated to do anything. 

I think I am just scared to face reality without weed. Weed has always been a support system, I can just smoke and forget everything that bothers me, but in reality I am just avoiding everything.

I rationalize smoking because I know it benefits me as well as hinders me. I feel like I have two personalities, one high and one not high. When I am high I am more compassionate, thoughtful, and happy. But there is always an underlying worry. I can have a headache or back ache and weed will fix it when other medications do nothing. So much more.

But...

I use weed to avoid life, my real self. I was an avoidant person before I started smoking, but now it is so much more amplified. I don't call my parents, if I'm fighting with my wife I will walk away, smoke and forget about it, I have not progressed in my career at all. I'm stuck. 

I know it is time to face reality. I don't have any friends that smoke anymore, in fact I don't have any friends other than my wife. My wife hasn't smoked in more than a year. So it's all on me. I don't know who I am without weed, all I know that I am scared to find out.

I was all alone when I was a serial quitter and now I realize it was because I was so frustrated to not get support.  No one knew what I was going through, but you guys definitely do and it has surprised me how much that helped.

You might be wondering why I am salty.  Today I had a defining moment.  I work in a warehouse and brought my kindle to read on the breaks.  At the end of the day, it was gone.  We just hired a few new people and one of them stole it.  I have not felt so irate in a very long time.  It felt like a piece of me was stolen.  All the books I have read, and all the books I was going to read, gone.  During the rage I went through on the drive home, I realized the old me would have loaded a bowl and pushed down those feelings, because damn was it unpleasant.  Oh the fury; pure, unadulterated fury.  But the new me decided to channel that rage into an extremely passionate workout.  I ran on a treadmill with rage in my heart and did push-ups as if I was trying to push the earth down.  I feel so much better.  The fury passed, and now I am ready to talk with my managers and see what I can do about this situation in a calm, collected manner.  Also, I will be really sore tomorrow, which I am looking forward to.

Thanks again, guys.  Never give in.

UPDATE:

Did not get my kindle back.  I pretty much expected that though of course I held onto a glimmer of hope.  A funny part of this whole thing is that there are only 8 people in the warehouse, and we all know who did it.  The new girl who works with us is definitely responsible.  I am a good judge of character, and she is the only one there that I do not trust.  Everyone but her was so nice and supportive of me.  I knew everyone had my back, and it felt great.  They said they would do whatever they can to help me and were impressed by how calm I was through this shittiness.  One of them actually confronted her for me (though I did not ask him to).  He took her aside and said he wanted to go 50/50 on the kindle.  Hilarious.  Of course she denied it.  Whatever.  It is so nice to realize I am becoming the person I want to be again and the people around me are responding positively to it.  My life is filling back up with the real love it was severely lacking.  The silver lining here is her stealing my possession showed how little it really meant to my happiness and showed me what is most important.  That bitch can have my kindle and continue her terrible life full of drugs and horrible tattoo decisions.

If you've seen my previous posts, you know that I've been having a really hard time with my moods, particularly because that's what I've been smoking to avoid. Now that I've been eating better, taking Leave-suggested supplements, and exercising, I've been doing a lot better! Been hanging out with stoner and non-stoner friends alike, and strangely, I haven't been getting any urges while my close friends toke up. I've dropped a lot of people who were only in my life because of bud. My close friends (who I think also have problems with weed dependency) have even seen my progress and have set a quit date to prepare for school! I'm so proud of them (and myself? can I say I'm proud of myself? I am!) I've been looking into yoga and meditation and I think I'm gonna give it a shot. Just gotta push myself a little harder, a concept that was foreign to me in my stoner days.

My short term memory (""What was I going to look up? Where did I put my glasses?"") is still crap, but I can tell it's getting better. My vocabulary is improving and I'm way more focused when reading books.

Nothin' really happening. Although I have enjoyed smoking weed because i think it always calmed me down as a hyper young guy, it's been less good side effects than bad in recent years. So I have an addiction and i'm really just tired of being stoned a lot. I've been growing that way for a few years, although i obviously went back to it.

Recently though, my friends and I started a film group that we've always wanted to do and I think this is the time to really stop. I look at this and I think it's really something i want to pursue right now. My friends (mostly non-smokers) are all working together and I can tell I could be contributing better quality (Not that I don't contribute good quality) things to the team as me and a couple others would be considered the leaders. It's just not my best. 

I honestly always saw myself as alone because for some reason i just had a hard time quitting, right from the get-go and no one else really had that. I smoked majority of the time every single day since the first time. If you added up the time without, the sporadic ""first"" days or rare month without, it would be like 6-8 months not smoking total.

Early usage was about an oz every 2.5 weeks, tapering to about .07 to 1.2 grams a day in my later years*

Just to clarify, the title should say its getting EASIER. It still inst easy. And I don't feel 'out of the woods' by any means.

Hey guys,and gals, Day 32. Ive tried to post once a week, and I'm a little late on this one. I think its mainly because I'm distancing myself from the drug, however I still follow leaves, and have read every post in the last 32 days.

Feels great for the most part. I still feel a lot of regret (regret all the damage ive done to my brain, time wasted, friendships lost) but at least I am now dealing with it and looking forward. Rather than smoking all those feelings in to the abyss.

For myself, being happy is everything. All I ever wanted was to be was in a good mood, happy, all the time, and thats all that mattered to me... And weed did that... I was productive in school, I could make a to-do list and stroke everything off the list with the help of Mary J. It made me do less thinking, and more doing (I realize for some it does the opposite). After the first year of heavy use, I just realized it wasn't doing its job anymore. It was making me anxious, making me withdraw from others, and leaving me out of tune with the world. And the worst part was it seemed impossible for me to quit for more than 2 days.

Until 1 month ago, I decided I was going to give it a shot when my supply ran out. I knew all I had to do was be willing to 'pay the price' so to speak. I had to endure withdrawal, sadness, depression, and irritability for a couple weeks and there would be a wonderful life on the other side. Leaves helped me sooo much through this part.

I feel much better, my head is clearer, relationships are 1,000,000 times better. My motivation for some things has suffered and I still have trouble being productive through the mundane tasks. Like honestly, cleaning can sometimes suck but when i was high it was a piece of cake. But hey, now I just enjoy having clean surroundings and view it less as something I 'have to do'.

It hasn't solved all my problems. As I mentioned, I have regret, and I still am bored a lot of the time. But boredom is really just telling myself to get my ass up. So if I'm bored, its usually because I'm trying to go through life without doing anything. I'm glad my body is telling me to get the fuck up and do something instead of being okay as a complacent vegetable.

Looking at my post from day one, [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1ga9qh/thoughts/), I was a confused little boy. My thoughts were scattered, I was scared, confused, and didn't know what to expect. When I read it now it is evident I was a different person (which just adds to my will to quit). I had one joint in my pocession the day I quit, and I flushed it down the shitter. At that point I was empowered and I knew I was in for the long haul. Thanks leaves, I just spilled my shit to you, and you accepted everything I threw at ya.

My first smoke was back in my junior year of high school, and at the time it was the most perfect, eye opening thing I could have ever imagined. All my troubles (terrible acne, stress about college, tension with my parents) seemed to disappear in exchange for a wonderful appreciation of music, profound philosophical musings and increased enthusiasm for life around me.

Fast-forward to the present and I am now exhibit A of the unfortunate specimen called ‘functioning daily stoner’. When at school I will smoke before I go to class, to the library, to my job at the student newspaper; at home this summer I will smoke before my internship, my other job, and family dinner. Up until now I had an arsenal of excuses to justify my habit: I go to one of the best schools in the country and have a GPA that has me on track to graduate with high honors, my teetotaling roommate is continually depressed and makes worse grades than I do, I have plenty of disposable income and what else am I going to spend it on, and on and on. 

After a few powerful experiences on Magic Mushrooms and LSD (I am not advocating for or against the use of psychedelics, this is just my story) I really began to question the role marijuana plays in my life. During one of my trips I returned in memory to my high school self that began to smoke weed and I saw a depressed and angsty teenager eager to find an escape for life’s many problems. And then I saw that I no longer dealt with many of those issues anymore: I’m comfortable being an atheist when my parents are religious, I’m OK not having a girlfriend because I know at some point in my life a woman will find me interesting and love me for who I am, I no longer wake up and stare at my many zits in anguish and despair. 

And yet I continued smoking in ever-increasing amounts. I felt drained all the time, and was only ever thinking about that next bowl, which wouldn’t even get me high anymore because of my ridiculous tolerance. A few weeks ago I started to read more about marijuana dependence, and decided I needed to get my life back in order. I finished my stash last night and am already feeling irritable, restless and anxious, but I’m ready to plow on through because I no longer want to be a slave to a stinky plant that leaves me sluggish and unfeeling. 

I blame only myself for getting to this place. I still believe marijuana is a wonderful thing that our world needs, but I abused its special powers and now I am paying the consequences. One day I hope to be able to get high again and limit use to a few times a month, but for the moment I am cutting it out one hundred percent because I know as soon as I score that next bag of sticky green, I’ll be constantly stoned until the bag runs out.

Seeing a counselor every week was a great help but I had to stop going to that because I had to move back home.

Show up for the first day on the job(after a whole semester of searching) and surprise surprise I had to take a drug test. By some ""cheating"", and a lot of luck I passed after three days sober. 

That was last thursday when i found out my drug test results. That night I smoked and it made me feel better temporarily sure. The next night I took the last of my stash and my bowl in my bag to go to a Ultimate frisbee tournament with my team. On my way to my apartment, I got pulled over suspiciously, and long story short, I fessed up to what I had on me. Now I have to go to court to try to and erase the charges of possession(only .2/.3) and paraphenialia(little bowl). I never thought something like this would happen to me.

But in the long, it'll be for the best. I will fix my problems and focus on bettering myself and not blazing up. I'm going to quit and I'm going to fucking like it! Sure I will have to jump through a lot of hoops because I wasn't careful enough, but I accept it as part of my journey and finally leaving those deceptive trees behind.

It seems now that i have extra energy also because i'm more alert and i wake up not feeling tired. I also feel happier and my senses seem sharper. But I'am definitely more hyper and my friends have been noticing since I can't stand still for a second haha.

I have been hanging out with my friends which still smoke and they do it in front of me. They are very surprised how i can handle not smoking while they are. I'm not really surprised because i know i have a good amount of discipline. I've always had discipline ever since i was young because of sports like boxing and wrestling and that(discipline) my friends is the ultimate key! You gotta be mentally strong and not give in, no matter what!

Also i suggest to do some other hobby to take up the hobby of smoking, something physical is what i like(jogging,basketball). Anyway I will come back here in about 10 more days to post some more. But for sure I'am confident that this will be successful for me and like i said discipline is what determines everything at the end of the day.

On Saturday, I had a lot of temptation to smoke because the body aches were getting so bad, but I went for a long walk and had some wine instead and I got through it. That was the only night that I drank.

Yesterday, I had a good friend of mine from back in high school (we're both 26 now) over and he taught me how to paint models. We ended up hanging out for a good 10 hours or so, and I had a lot of fun. Last time I saw him was a month or so ago and I didn't really have fun and went home after like 3 hours, so this is definitely an improvement. I still was sort of achey but it didn't bother me much.

Today, I feel fine. I really do. My stomach is normal, I don't feel any more achey than I would on any other normal Monday morning, and I slept well. I have not given in to temptation once, no joint, pipe or vape has touched my lips since exactly 7 days ago.

I'm not going to edit it and it will just be what flows. You don't have to read it. I just want to get it off my chest. Thanks. =)

I have been smoking daily for almost 8 years. I've taken breaks (a month in 2011 and a couple days here and there when I was sick), but I've been high for almost half my life. It started out of boredom and curiosity, but then at the end of 2005, I had the ""brilliant"" idea that my New Years resolution was to smoke every day of 2006. What can I say, I was 18 and an idiot. I did some really stupid shit too (like taking bong rips...at 4:20am...while driving...on the freeway). I am very lucky that nothing bad happened.

It was the ""cool"" thing to do. Though I struggled with depression and self confidence for most of my life, it really got bad when I was 15. Weed was my savior. It made me more mellow (I also had crazy anger issues...let's face it, I was (still am) bipolar), made life more enjoyable, and got me some friends.

I met my current boyfriend (6 years in October) because of weed. We were friends for a couple years, then finally ""took the plunge"" (sorry for the overuse of quotes). 

I've been trying to quit for 2-3 years now. It's been at the ""I know I should, but I am totally functional, so it's ok"" stage for the majority of that time. I worked on an off. Had a steady job as a pizza delivery driver for 2 years until I totally fucked that up (ranted about work on Facebook). After that I went into a severe depression where I was smoking from morning until night, just trying to escape my thoughts and life. Oh, I should mention that I was suicidal from when I was 15 to about 2 years ago, when I started therapy...I'm 25 now). 

My entire relationship with my bf has been high. He smokes too. We love each other a lot, but I'm afraid that weed is all we have in common. I think that's part of the reason I've been so scared to smoke. I'd rather keep smoking than lose him (I know, I know). Also in Feburary he was able to quit smoking for 2 weeks without any issue. I ended smoking even more while he wasn't. He's been trying to be good (only doing on the weekends, not when he's on-call for work, etc), but I feel like I'm the little devil on his shoulder, though I've never explicitly made/asked him to smoke. I suppose smoking while he's sitting right next to me doesn't help.

Flash forward to now. (This is really jumbled, I'm sorry). I went back to school in Janurary 2012, in a field that I love and feel like I've really found my calling. I got a job in June (not working there anymore, but for reasons I'll get to). Things have definitely been looking up. And I've done it with a constant haze. And I've done it well. Of course I could have put more effort into it, but even before I started smoking I was a procrastinator and super lazy.

But it's gotten to the point that I don't even really like being high. I like the act of smoking and that it gives me an excuse to be lazy. But sitting on the couch watching TV for 6-8 hours every night (not even an exaggeration), smoking is getting really old. So it's not so much that I want to stop smoking, I just want to not feel like I have to. And I want to do other things.

Right now I'm visiting my family in another country. I don't get to see them often, so I'll be here for 2 months. The plan was to sober up while I was here. I didn't think I'd be able to get anything here, but it's readily available. All I have to do is ask.

I'm almost at my 2 week mark. The first week wasn't bad. I only really craved it at night, when I missed my bf. Now the cravings are getting worse. The clincher was today. My dad has been have back spasms, so I suggested he should smoke or eat something (we're not a doctor-seeing, pill-popping family). My sister brought over some used stuff from her vape and I made him some butter (ok, I dipped my finger in the butter to try it, but I didn't get high, so I'm not counting it as breaking my sobriety). He also smoked out of the vape a little bit. And then the vape was just sitting there, next to me, just begging to be smoked. I knew I just had to ask and I would be able to, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. There wasn't much bud, so A. I didn't want to smoke all of it and not have any for my dad, and B. I didn't want to just take a hit and not feel anything and have it be wasted (my 2 weeks and the weed). I am proud of myself for not smoking, as I am very bad at saying ""no"". There's also a container of butter in the fridge that I keep thinking about, but can't bring myself to eat any. He's getting a bigger supply tomorrow, though and all I can think about it smoking it. 

I don't even know if I want to quit anymore. I've felt myself be more irritable lately, but my sleep and appetite have been fine (my sweet tooth went away for a week or so, but it's back). I haven't found a way to spend my time yet. I know lots of people say exercise and I know that's what I should do, but as I've said before, I've always been lazy. I have work I need to do too, but all I've been doing is browsing Reddit and playing that horrible Candy Crush game on my phone. Like literally, that's ALL I've been doing. 

This has become a horrible rant and I don't even want to post it anymore, but I've seen how supportive you guys are and I'm hoping someone will say something that will make me really want to quit. I haven't had that defining moment or reason to quit yet. With cigarettes and alchol, I basically over-did it with both, they betrayed me (involved lots of vomiting) and I never wanted to touch them again (I do drink beer now, but no hard liquor). So I've pretty much been waiting for that to happen.

That's what we're here to talk about. The activity of NOT doing something. It's a strange orientation for a body that is so used to going forward. Our most ancient ancestors had that impulse, and it was all they had: do.

So ""don't"" is hard for people. Especially when it involves a habit that has been so entrenched in the mind.

Luckily, the mind is not concrete.

It's a mysterious organ, its functioning not completely understood by science nor explained by spirituality. It can do things like the placebo effect, hallucinations, hypnosis, madness, and obviously a lot more.

However, one does not have to be a zen master, a psychologist, or a shaman to have a strong mind, or to change one's self through the use of that mind.

I will always recommend meditation for people. I won't go into it much here, I just want to put it out there. It may be the most important practice you'll ever take on.

Now, the meat of the post:

There are a few stages to quitting, really quitting. The process may involve one step, or it may involve stepping between these stages, fluctuating until balance is achieved. It can, of course, be done by anybody.

When one decides to quit, one is taking a vow of abstinence. If a person is used to taking and obeying vows, it may be easier for them. For everybody else, it's an art.

You can't ""not smoke."" That's not an activity. It's not something you can do, or participate in, or practice. It's a lifestyle choice. Your lifestyle must change. It must change for the positive. Quitting smoking means two things:

1: Accounting for the inevitable gaps in time left by abstinence. If you're here, you probably smoke way too much, to the point where it's interfering with your life. It's probably stealing a lot more time than you think. And what are you going to do with this time? Sit and think about not smoking?

So you have to decide how you're going to spend all your time. All of it. Get a planner or calendar. I use the All-Powerful Google's. Account for meals, activities with friends, work, legitimate hobbies, and reading. You should be reading books.

The point is that free time is the enemy. Idle hands and all that. It's not your fault that you want to smoke when you're not thinking about anything else (or even when you are!). Your brain has just been conditioned. It needs to be re-conditioned, with a new pattern of activity.

2: You need to destroy your triggers. Sure, there are obvious physical steps you can take: I've thrown away countless pipes, had desperate binging ""I'll finish it all now so I can quit tomorrow"" sessions (they don't work btw), hidden shit at friends' house, gave it away...

Some of those are all good steps to take. The mental environment of the smoker must be broken down. The things that remind you of smoking draw you to the activity itself. Removing things from one's living space (anywhere, not just home) is a crucial step in disassociation.

But there's a deeper severance you must make. Manipulating the material world to avoid temptation - is that really what you want to do? Look at burkas, and Islam. There's a point where it becomes unrealistic to keep removing yourself from weed icons, smells, smokers, and the like. Do you *want* to join a church? Become a puritan?

Those mental triggers that drive one to smoke must be destroyed. There's a set of actions that you participate in every day: the ritual of smoking. It doesn't start with inhaling, it starts with getting out the jar, the pipe, the papers, the bong, the grinder. From there it's an automatic process. You know it's an automatic process.

Isolate this ritual. Explore the mind, understand the thoughts that draw you to it. Then, you must nullify them. When those thoughts crop up, don't become angry or fearful or lustful. Don't focus on them: focus on the task at hand. You allocated all your time, didn't you?


With daily repetition of your new routine, your body and mind will become used to your new lifestyle as a musician becomes used to playing a song. It becomes easier and less conscious of a process with practice. Not to say you shouldn't be conscious... but your current unconscious activities have brought you here, have they not? It is good to change them.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,1370325764.0,,,True,t3_1fmwmv,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1fmwmv/more_mind_tricks_for_leaves/,

The last time I made it any length of time was over Xmas, and I was out of state so I was dry and visiting family. The rush of emotions and endorphins that accompanied seeing family helped mask any physiological issues. I didn't notice anything physically disabling about it that time.

This time however I am re-encountering the main issue that's tripped me up in previous attempts. The problem is when I'm not high, I have no appetite. Like fucking NONE. I know my body is telling me I'm hungry but I cannot force down food without getting nauseous. I have only consumed a couple hundred calories in the last 72 hours and I can feel my blood sugar dropping by the hour but I still can't eat more than a bite or two.

In years past, I would just go back to smoking and be able to eat just fine. I don't want to do that anymore. I know that the years of smoking has screwed with my brain chemistry and what not, but if any of you have encountered the same issue, how did you get around it without smoking? 


EDIT: So I talked with some friends who had good suggestions. A fruit smoothie, like a Jamba Juice is pretty easy to get down, and a fast source of blood sugar. Exercise could also help bring back a natural caloric demand, but I'll have to wait for my blood sugar to rise before attempting anything strenuous.

I hope you won't mind if I throw in a big chunk of history and explain my situation.  Don't feel obliged to read it, I think it might help me to write it though.

I had a bad childhood.  It might not seem so from an outside perspective as it was pretty much clear of specific bad incidents.  My parents are great and always supported me.  However I have social and emotional problems.  I never engaged with people my age (I can remember clearly fewer than 5 friends up to the age of at least 17).  I've tried to forget that part of my life but it probably affected me more than I'd like.  By this point I'd only tried weed a few times.

I'd always liked the idea of pot.  I believed it facilitated philosophical thinking, introspection and a sort of secular spiritualism.  I hadn't been exposed to any negative affects, only second hand stories from people I didn't trust on the issue of drugs (authority figures).

I was always very intelligent as well.  With stacks of good grades and oodles of confidence I went to a good university.  I'd intended to smoke weed at university, and hadn't put any thought into how much.  I was confident in my own academic abilities.

I had moved out of my parent's house to live on campus and found a few friends who helped turn me from ""someone who had smoked"" to ""a smoker"".  I didn't eat well or keep my place clean, but I thought that was just normal for a student.

But things seemed good because, for the first time EVER, I was happily, comfortably socialising and other people actually wanted to talk to me!  We had a guy in our group who had also had social problems.  He hung around with us but nobody ever called him to go out, or asked for his input unless they were doing it to be nice.  None of us disliked him and we all tried to make him welcome, but we struggled to enjoy conversation with him.  I knew that I had been like this and I was proud of how far I'd come (I still am).  I came to realise that weed was treating my social problems!  I was also happier than I had ever been and I thought the pot was helping to treat depression.

At the end of my first year, I failed some exams.  At the time I didn't consider it a huge deal.  I took re-sits and passed them, but decided anyway to change my course slightly and sit first year again.  I also decided, with my parents, that I couldn't afford to continue staying on campus, and I could look after myself better at home.  So I moved home.

Then (3-4 years ago) the problems really started.  My parents had great difficulty adjusting to me smoking pot.  I was subtle as a rule but we are a close family and things don't go unnoticed.  Living at home, I had to travel over 4 hours a day to school and back.  The travel expenses were close to what I was paying at uni anyway, so I didn't really have more money.

I sat and completed the first year (since I'd learned most of it before) but after that my work dropped.  I had never learned independent study.  I had never needed to, but now that I did I just didn't have the self control skills in place.  I wasn't really aware of falling behind until my first set of exams halfway through the year.  3/4 exams came up F.  I passed the resits but then, at the end of the year, got 3 Fs in my end-of-year exams.  I dropped out.

For the later part of my university life my smoking rose massively.  I can't remember any point between smoking maybe 3g a week and smoking more like 15g a week, but it happened.  There were warning signs I should have seen, but I excell at manipulation and without realising I had begun to rationalise my own irrational behaviour.  For example, I began to take fits of anger and misery when I didn't have smoke, but I blamed it not having money, or being let down by a friend, or whatever circumstance stopped me having weed.  

Cue 3 years of unemployment, diagnosed depression, failed course of antidepressants, possibly the worst job in Scotland and more and more unemployment and depression.  Smoking throughout.  Couple of attempts to quit ended in huge (irrelevant) arguments or inability to be around people, which gave me an excuse to go and buy more.

Then. about 6 months ago, I got a good job.  I say ""good"", what I mean is stable.  But the work is hard, it pays minimum wage and I get up at 3.30am to go there.  And I hope you'll forgive this bit of arrogance when I say that the job is below me.  I'm quite capable of handling pages of schematics and calculations (or I was, and could be again) but I'm packing food for rich folks with no chance to advance.

And that's where I am, really.  Living at home, barely employed with no future and a stack of debt.  Not what I expected when I left for uni 5 years ago.

The problem is I still don't feel able to function properly without weed.  I can now handle days or weeks at a time (which is a helluva step up from where I have been) but only knowing that I can/will get weed gets me through.  

When I stop smoking, I'm no longer the person I want to be.  I'm spiteful, unpleasant, frustrated and worried.  I don't like people and they don't like me.  When I am smoking I am who I should be.  I'm calm, pleasant, abiding and, frankly, happy.

I want to believe in a future where I can be happy, or at least NOT unhappy, without weed.  But I don't know how.  I was never happy before weed, and I still feel I'm treating depression and social anxiety with it.

Right now I'm day 1 clean and I don't plan to pick up soon, but knowing me there will be a reason and it will be perfectly justified at the time.  

I'm literally searching for reasons to smoke all the time.  ""My parents will be out for a few days."",""My dad is on holiday."" (I smoke with my dad), ""I'm seeing an old friend."", ""Work is too hard."", ""Work is too easy."", ""I have extra money."", ""There's a new film/TV show I want to see."" (I struggle to keep my eyes on the TV without becoming uncomfortable around people, or frustrated with the show, or myself, or something).

I don't know if I'm ready to ask for help, I'm so scared.  I have so little in my life other than smoking, and it's such an important part of my identity.  So I'm not asking.  I'm absolutely open to anything anyone wants to offer, I'm just not *asking* because the only way I could make up for your kindness would be to quit, and I just can't promise that.

**TL:DR:**  On top of the world starting my life.  5 years later I'm no further forward.  Smoking is a problem but I also use it as a solution to other problems.

So I guess that's it.  I hope it's ok to leave an introduction post like this.  Hello all.  :)

I'm a 35/f, almost daily smoker for about 20 years. My father and brother were daily smokers and it was always around. I developed quite a habit. Recently I was struggling to make a 1/4 last through the week. That money really adds up.

I quit because I had a massive panic attack that sent me into a bad place emotionally. I used to say that the trees was my only salvation from the years of anxiety and depression. But I could be wrong. It hasn't been long enough yet to tell. I was emotionally addicted for sure. When I'd run out, I was a wreck. Bitchy, emotional and always trying to figure out how to get more. I never thought I'd be able to come this far. 

Of course I still think about it. There's an 1/8 sitting in the next room that I have no desire to touch. Although some would say that after 20 years, a month sober is an accomplishment ... I sometimes feel guilty for being proud that I've been sober for a month. Well, because I was scared into it. But now that the anxiety is slowly decreasing, I still don't want to go back.

Two nights ago I was hanging out with some friends, one of which wass my ""guy"" for picking up. They all smoked a J while I sat alone on the couch. It was not tempting really at all and their joking at my expense about how ""non heterosexual"" I was being for not smoking didnt bother me either. They also tried to get me to sell them my volcano which I have no plans of doing at the moment. I dont think I will never smoke again and if I do I want it to be with the Volc. I know keeping it around is kind of taboo on this sub but I also have a bunch of weed left over and plenty of other stuff locked away in my closet. I like knowing its there and I am strong enough to not use it. 

Anyway, just thought I'd share and maybe give a little hope to those who are considering quitting. Its not all that tough for everyone (I smoked everyday for the last 7/8 years) so jump on this bandwagon and get ready to live your life. Oh and last thought: my friend asked me how I think I am better off now when they were all smoking and here are some of the things which came to mind. I feel more healthy, confident, energetic, optimistic, less frustrated, less anxious, better memory, working out more, eating better, spending more and higher quality time on my hobbies/using my free time more efficiently...and many more.

I used to be a heavy smoker when I was younger. Recently I started smoking again - it seemed OK at first but soon escalated to a level which was not compatible with my life. 

I spoke with my therapist about it and she recommended I begin to make notes about my psychological state around smoking. How did I feel before smoking each day? During? What was my attitude towards it? Was it as pleasant as I thought?

This, mixed with active discussion (in therapy but also with friends if you can't afford/access therapy) about what I thought I was getting out of smoking helped me to isolate the *reasons* I was smoking again. Once I started to see how it was affecting me more clearly, and understand why I was doing it - it became easier to stop. I'm a week in now and while it's been tough (no sleep, night sweats and more) I also genuinely don't feel tempted to smoke. 

tl;dr: understanding the reasons why I smoked by writing down my feelings regularly for a couple of weeks helped me to cut out cravings.

 This is probably stemming from some sort of psychological problem, but like, fuckin a.  I just have trouble imaging that I'll never smoke again since its my drug of choice, and I love drugs too much.  Being addicted to something just gives me one main objective in life (to get high) and it simplifies everything.  I don't have to worry about anything else, as getting high is the only thing that matters. And I LOVE that.  Maybe that's my problem(well obviously it is).

Here's another update.

Even with minor withdrawals from how much I was smoking, it's pretty easy to refrain from smoking before noon, and to go at least 5 hours between bowls, which is the stage of the weaning process I've been on for the past few days.  I was taking an AVB pill before bed, but I recently cut that out, and I definitely feel it in that I'm jonesing for my noon bowl a lot more.  Tomorrow, I won't smoke before 5PM, so this may be where things get challenging.  Other than that, this has been a pretty smooth process.

Here are some reflections about my relationship with weed that this process has given me:

* Previously, smoking was a compulsion.  I wasn't toking to get high.  It was just an automatic behavior I was doing because I was used to getting a neurological reward for doing so, but the end result was just burnout and wasted weed.

* As well as I thought I focused on weed, I'm way sharper sober.  People tolerated me on weed because they just assumed that ""weird"" was part of my personality, but focused and engaged is a much better presentation to the world.

* My tolerance is already adjusted.  Instead of maintaining a constant haze, I feel contrast between when I toke and when I don't.  The highs feel less mundane and more ""special occasion"" than when I was waking and baking, and during the sober times I feel much more present and engaged.

* Boredom is the enemy.  Over the weekend I had a bit more downtime than I've previously had since I started weaning, and those were the times when it was hard to convince myself not to smoke.  I can see how the cycle starts.  ""There's nothing to do so why not get high"" turns into ""clear your schedule so you can get high"", and you just disconnect from everything that's not related to getting high.

* I'm down from about 6-10 bowls per day to 2 bowls per day without any significant withdrawals or tests to my willpower.  In that time, I had a home repair, a car repair, hosted a dinner party with my wife, set up 2 separate jam sessions with some different musicians I know, and never really hit a breaking point (rare for me because I'm a high strung guy).  Knowing I'd be able to unwind with a bowl in X hours always made it ok for me compared to those times when I've pushed myself to the brink going cold turkey and broke down over little things like traffic.  

I think willpower is like a muscle, and you have to train it like a muscle.  If you were going to run a marathon, you wouldn't show up having not trained.  You would run a little bit every day, building up your miles until you can run the 26 miles or whatever distance a marathon is.  I think going cold turkey is like trying to run that marathon without training, and weaning is like coming up with a training program to get you to your goal.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1b11wl,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1b11wl/another_weaning_update/,

I ruin relationships because I get high and retreat into my mind. 
I smoke to forget about my problems. I am ruining my back sitting here in front of the computer all day. When I am bored with playing video games, instead of finding something 
else to do, I just smoke and continue playing video games. I even get worse at those video games when I am high. I find myself making poor decisions constantly and I am 
completely unaware of my surroundings. I can only imagine how this is affecting my life, and I know it is, but I just smoke those worries away too. I am 24 years old, turning 
25 in a week. I have smoked everyday for probably 8 years, and although I have taken breaks from smoking many times in there, it has never been for a significant amount of time
I am emotionally stunted and I know it. While I can't blame that part on the weed, it is probably a factor, and it has most definitely stopped me from coping with my problems.
I think about my life, how sad it really is, and it makes me sick. I spend all day alone, working from home. Then, for fun, I sit at home alone on my computer, doing a lot of 
the same things I do while working, such as reddit. I want to make things, but I lack motivation. I want to meet people, but I feel so worthless. I want to find a girlfriend, 
but I am too insecure. I want to make something of myself, but I am not good at anything. I want to be normal. I want to be happy. I find myself scared to go out into public.
Sometimes I feel like I am stuck at 16. My body is growing, everything around me is changing, but my mind is the same. I haven't grown in years. I have no marketable skills to 
speak of, and while everyone else was educating themselves and becoming a useful member of society, I ditched class to smoke my days away. I have always had self esteem issues,
I can remember being extremely uncomfortable in social situations since I was a kid. As I've grown up, I never came to terms with this anxiety, instead I avoided it. The recent 
tipping point was a girl I was going out with. We were having fun until she kissed me, then I turned into the 14 year old, self-conscious, clingy loser that I realized I am.
I feel like life is passing me by, the world is turning, people are growing. Friends that I knew from school that I smoked with have real jobs, wives and houses. A lot of them
have kids. I can't even imagine subjecting a new human to my life.


There are a lot of changes I need to make in my life, but I am going to start with smoking. Hopefully this way, I won't be ok with all the time I am wasting.

Why am I posting this? Because I wandered here with only a vague notion of quitting. Then I read a few posts that highlighted a lot of my own problems and it helped me realize, I NEED to quit.

I'm thinking about quitting smoking pot for many reasons.  Some of the advice I've been given (and it's good advice) is to find a hobby or something that I enjoy that will occupy my time.

I'm struggling with that.  I don't have any real interests or hobbies outside of the computer, and that's not going to work, because I'm too used to getting high and being on the computer.  Playing games or derping around on the 'net isn't as much fun when I'm sober.

But I have no real desire to do *anything*.  Any hobbies that spark a remote interest in me are either too expensive or too time-consuming.  People say they want to quit smoking weed because it's holding them back from something, or keeping them from being able to do something that they want to do.

Well, I just took a nap to avoid my friend's smoking offer and I could not be happier. I ended up having a lucid dream. If someone doesn't know, it's just the ability to consciously do whatever you want while still unconscious.

Funny thing is that the dream started with me smoking a fat blunt that I somehow got for free in my hall bathroom. I return to my room where me and my friend continue to smoke it. Next thing I know, I'm on steps outside an apartment complex still smoking with my pal. (I think the steps symbolize the rise to soberness) Then, I enter a deeper dream within that dream that I don't remember too well. After that I could feel myself on the verge of waking up and it was then I realized the *first* dream with the fat blunt was actually a dream. So I get another dose from the sandman and miraculously re-enter the first dream. At this point I know I'm dreaming. I get handed the blunt and take one final, extremely long drag. I then hand it back to my friend, turn around (turning my back on the weed), run at the apartment buildings, and start flying. It was the greatest sober/non-sober, conscious/unconscious moment I have ever had. I made it to the top of the building and was overcome with so much excitement that I then woke up. (I was gonna fly to this chick's house and bang the crap out of her)

So if you can master lucid dreaming, just smoke in your dreams! My unconscious clearly still wants to, but I can tell it's conflicted since I am trying my hardest ever to stop, and it has been going great. I just wanted to use this story as some sort of motive for people to stop and really take note of your dreams because they are a vital part of our psyche.

I still had to say ""No"" to a craving tonight and refocus, but I hope eventually the craving will go away completely. What's strange is I've noticed that when I say no to the urge to smoke, then following it I have the urge to drink coffee. It's like I'm really just craving some sort of chemical stimulation. Saying no to one suggestion just causes my mind to suggest another. I don't really have to fight the urge to drink coffee at night, it's not a part of my regular routine so it's easy to just give it a weird look and it just sees itself out.

edit: I've noticed something else worth mentioning, though I almost forgot to tell you. Tonight, as with last night, I feel very tired. Usually I don't feel like this until about 10 pm. Right now it's 7:35 and I just want to go to bed. It's like my mind has accepted the fact that I'm not feeding it weed or coffee like it asked, and in response to that fact it's decided to just shut down and now I'm craving sleep instead of those things. 

I'm wondering why that is and whether or not I should just give in and go to bed. Perhaps the lack of stimulation is making me want sleep? Am I depressed or something? I don't feel sad, and I don't even feel sleepy, just heavy, tired, craving my bed. I really want to get stuff done tonight, but I don't want night-coffee or super-early bedtime to be my new routine. What if I just went to bed early tonight, maybe things would be better tomorrow and I won't feel this way?

edit 2: It's nearly 8:30 pm now, about 2 hours after I'd normally have started smoking after getting out of work.

The more research I do on the use of hemp and the effects of different cannabinoids and all the old political rhetoric being proved wrong I find I've become a champion for weed even though its the vampire in my life sucking me dry of funds that I could be using to garnish life experiences

I look back and I wonder where the last two years went.

I dropped out of college summer of 2010. Its winter 2012 now and all I've been doing every day for the last two years is working, lifting weights, and driving around aimlessly high to places just being bored

I entertain thoughts of quitting and saving up for something but my families financial situation has got me hopelessly trying to run from the reality that we live paycheck to paycheck and I failed to get a good enough job to support my family

Now its like I'm in total denial of the fact that the fuse is burning out and all I'm doing is wasting gas and burning trees

I don't know what I want to do with my life

I like to tell myself that with my addictive personality if I can get into something I'll get really good at it

Lifting has kept me sane. I've dropped a lot of fat and put on a lot of muscle and I've been getting a lot of positive feedback from my loved ones

I spend most of my time alone. Relationships feel like a burden to me... always having to manage other peoples emotions when I can barely manage my own.

Much more simple to burn a bowl, turn on some tunes, chat with like minded individuals on reddit and then burn a few more bowls before heading off to bed to work the next day

I get lonely and horny from time to time. Porn helps a lot. I spend a lot of nights wondering ""why""... I find myself having the same thoughts as I've had months or weeks ago repeating themselves like beating a dead horse

It's all coming to a crash and burn. When I'm not high I entertain suicide... but if my psychedelic experiences have taught me anything its that life throws curveballs at you to keep things interesting but I can't help but not give a shit about planning for the future or really more than two weeks in advance...

It's strange to feel a plant take over your life to feed off of your life force by being incinerated and inhaled

But weed tends to keep me in the present able to enjoy the little things and hide from the tremendous stress of being a pothead dropout with no financial backings to support his waitress mom and highschool kid brother

I guess I'm just in denial. About everything. About being human and human needs like companionship and community and hard work and success. In denial of even being real sometimes.

I always hope to the universe before I go to bed at night that I won't wake up.

Or that I will wake up in a permanent lucid dream where I control my life and experiences and get to enjoy the best reality that could possibly happen...

But I always wake up, right on track, same plot, same storyline as usual... and go to work. The weeks keep going by. The paychecks keep coming. The bowls keep burning and the bank account stays empty.

Cold-turkey.  I gave away my grinder, and my pipes and papers.  I didn't think it was even a big deal at the time, but now I've only smoked maybe 2 times in the last 3 years.

First off, let me clear up a misconception.  Marijuana is addicting.  You can call it mental, physical, or whatever, but when I quit, I had real symptoms - anxiety, restlessness, irritability, etc.

What I hadn't counted on when I quit is that I got my ambition back.  I had been working in the film industry, and sort of treading water.  After quitting, I decided to take the LSAT and go to law school.  I took the LSAT two years in a row to improve my score, and landed a near-full scholarship - something I wasn't sure was even a possibility.  

When I quit, I wasn't sure if it was the right thing to do.  But with the benefit of hindsight, I can see how much better my life became once I decided to give up pot.  

Like the rules in this subreddit say, I have no problem with people smoking pot.  I have friends who smoke every day, and it's fine for them.  But for me - no way.

In high school, I was president of my school, captain of two varsity sports teams and voted most likely to succeed (and first to make $1 million). I was outgoing, and literally knew everyone in the school. I was always the friend in my group who organized and made plans and was always up for new experiences. 
The night I got in to an ivy league school was the first night I ever took a hit. All of my friends had been smoking almost daily for years. Within six months, I was smoking every day. Thanks to a bat-shit crazy roommate, this coincided with a period of severe anxiety and depression. At first it was beneficial because the weed numbed me to all the symptoms of the depression. However, the depressive episode soon passed, but bud has me stuck in an anxious-nervous place that I need to escape. 
Aside from taking two weeks off, i have not had a serious break in smoking at all. I have wanted to stop the entire time. I have been seriously trying to quit for the past six months now. In past two weeks I have really contemplated it. Yet here I sit, faced with the choice of smoking with my friends after class or going to the library to prepare for an exam I have on thursday. Here are just a few reasons for why I should quit I have made while sitting here reading r/leaves. 

* Health - During my depression during my freshman spring-sophomore fall, I gained just about 70 lbs. I went from being &lt;230 to my current weight of 295. Whenever I feel as if my smoking is under control, I lose weight drastically. But when i'm smoking my usual amount, the weed contributes to a lethargic and sedentary lifestyle which causes severe changes in weight (both loss and gain).   

* Personal Finances - I used to be frugal and had the ability to budget my expenses so that I had money to enjoy the weekend with my friends. Now if I have 60 dollars, the bulk is going to an eighth and thats my weekend. 

* friendships - As I stated earlier, I used to be extremely extroverted and outgoing. I knew everyone and would go out of my way to see multiple groups. Now I have like 3-4 friends who all blaze and we never end up doing things. I frequently blow off good friends who keep giving me chances and I always let them down and I feel like such an ass for doing it. 

* Love Life - When I was in high school I had two long term relationships with girls I still adore. My freshman year of college I did very well (as I was not smoking all that heavily). Since then, however, my relationships and hook ups have been few and far between. At first i thought this was just due to the weight gain, but after a few occasions where I did put myself out there, i've found it was still easy as hell to get laid, I was just a paranoid, anxious stoner. 

* Cognition - As I said earlier, I was (and still am) one of the smartest kids from my home environment. I was always sharp and quick witted and had a ridiculous memory. My claim to fame was creating and memorizing 1700 flashcards for an AP US History exam. Now however, I often stutter and slip up punch lines or comebacks. My friends will sit and make jokes from tv shows we've watched together and I can't even remember where i've heard them from. The worst part is, when i'm really fucked up, like 4th time i've smoked in the past two hours fucked up, I just trail off mid sentence. 

**MOST IMPORTANT**
* Reputation - Everyone knows me now as a stoner. The other day I was discussing with a friend how I found this girl attractive. The girl in question has a reputation as being a massive bitch, but has always been nice to me. The friend's response was ""yeah i could see how someone who smokes weed all the time like you could find a girl like that interesting."" Typing this out it sounds much more condescending now then at the time, but it had a really lasting impact. I just want to return to a place where I'm known for being outgoing and a good guy and not just a stoner. 

I know things won't go back to the way they were. But I don't want them to be where they are. I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this. I don't expect much feedback but honestly I haven't told anyone close to me that I feel this way and just needed a place to express myself.

All is well. No real cravings to speak of. Still think about weed sometimes but not in the want to smoke way, its just kind of there. Definitely getting cool dreams although they do seem to be getting less vivid. People in my house still smoke and iv'e found that the smell is awful. Doesn't tempt me at all.

Ummmmmm yeah ive gained some weight which was an unezpected side effect but once it stops raining and i get back on the track bike it will go away. 

Advice: Do something physical once a day. For most of my thirty days i ride my track bike to and from work (about ten miles), SF hills. That was enough to really take my mind off of smoking. Get into some video games. Put a little distance between you and your stoner friends, at least for a bit. Melatonin and Valerian root help on the nights where sleep seems impossible. 

Yeah and post to leaves. It helps a lot. Great community.

I started smoking 2 yrs ago and it helped to save my life and get me out of a cycle of depression and suicidal thoughts. However I noticed I had become surrounded with bad people as a result of my habit, and lost my drive to get myself out of largely self perpetuating cycle of smoking everyday to escape from my shitty job while never able to apply for a better job because of the incessant smoking. I found out after i quit toking that my ""friends"" of the last two years were actually just people I did drugs with, and as soon as I stopped packing bowls and buying booze they turned on me. 
I'm very proud of my progress thus far--i haven't re-upped, haven't smoked or even contacted my old dealer, and my SO is very supportive. The first couple weeks I was irritable and subject to mood swings. After that I started having the most vivid nightmares for a period of 2-3 weeks. I almost started smoking just to stop dreaming: in retrospect it is funny that I used to look forward to dreaming prior to using cannabis and now afterwards dreams occur with such frequency that I just want them to stop. The nightmares largely stopped after 45 days and i associate them/their intensity with my body getting rid of the thc still in my system. Since then, I've started smoking in my dreams: for a long time (45days) I couldn't even allow myself to get high in my dreams: I would pass the j or bong. Yesterday I woke up with my hand lifting in the process of pulling the bowl so I could clear the bong I had dreamt of that night. I still obviously want to smoke and my subconscious clearly hasn't stopped toking, but for me if i have weed I will smoke it every day until its gone. It's difficult if not impossible for me to smoke in moderation and conversely I don't want to stretch out my stash BC I know I will slip back into my old lifestyle of smoking everyday. That contradictory mentality doesn't help so the only solution I have found is total abstinence. In addition while the city I live in has decrim'd possession of &gt;35g, the state law here is rough and truly not worth the risk. I'm planning on moving next year to a friendly state (fingers crossed for Nov. Elections) and will update accordingly. Until then its a long road and I am tempted everyday.

(LONG)",dailybean2012,16,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/114qys/i_really_do_want_to_quit_but_i_cant_stop/,"I posted my story here in some comments not too long ago and since then I've really been focused on making some critical life changes.  Plus I could really use the outlet to vent. 

To sum up my situation...

I'm 28 years old.  I've been smoking since I was 16, both cigarettes and cannabis.  I was a great student up until then.  Once I started smoking my school life went up in smoke.  I was eventually expelled from high school for getting into a bad situation with pot that wasn't even mine.  On my 18th birthday I got pulled over and caught with a roach.  I was put on probation but I was a cocky teenager, and eventually violated my probation. This gave me a month of jail time and it ruined my plea bargain, putting the incident on my criminal record. 

I spent the next few years partying with my friends and not really thinking about my education.  I finally got around to getting my GED once I turned 19 and I didn't really think about my future after that.  I had a great time, but after a few years everything just sort of...hazed together. 

I started falling out with my pothead friends.  Around this time is when I started hiding the fact that I smoked from a lot of people that I recently met.  Then I came across my now ex fiancee.  Things between us where great for a while, but I still hid the truth behind how much I really smoked from her.  After a while my highs started getting much different.  Partially due to the fact that a medical bill was passed for my state, so all of my friends rushed to their cards and suddenly the best of the best started cropping up all over town.  

The highs started to make me depressed, anxious and paranoid.  I got so paranoid that it ruined the relationship I had with my ex.  The depression that followed me after that situation was a big motivator to turn my life around. I couldn't smoke. It just made me even more upset.  I started working out and I noticed how much more social and better I felt about myself after being clean for a few months.  Life really was great.  I had ladies frequently flirting with me and I didn't go braindead, I wasn't anxiously texting my ex waiting for a response, I wasn't wasting 12 hours a day playing video games, hoping for some magical thing to come around and change my life.  I was able to finally talk and connect with my family again.  When I was a heavy smoker I often went out of my way to avoid them since we had very different views on my habits. I also started to worry about my future and I started gaining some interest in furthering my education. 

That was 2 years ago.  After about 6 months of being clean I started hanging out with my old crew again. I thought I had developed the will power to say no.   Unfortunately that wasn't the case. I started smoking shortly after we started hanging out again.  It started out as a social thing when we were out at the bar, then it turned into a sleep aid, and then a few weeks later it spun out of control.  

Since then I've spent the past 2 years as a hermit, smoking more pot by myself than I ever have in the past.  I'm in a depressed slump, I have no motivation to do anything, I feel like working my dead end job for 9 bucks an hour is acceptable for someone my age.  I spend my days off sleeping for 12-16 hours more often than not. I haven't hung out with anyone aside from swinging by my best friend/dealers house to grab a bag for a few minutes. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. I keep telling myself that tomorrow will be the day, and then without even thinking about it I take a toke from my one-hitter as soon as I wake up, or I take that after work smoke without a second thought and then the cycle continues.  I keep digging myself into a hole and I feel like there is no way out.  I'm too embarrassed to come out and admit these things to most of my friends.  They have the mentality that marijuana isn't addictive and it's easy to quit, when most of them haven't tried or were never heavy smokers to begin with.  

I'm sorry if this is a bit long.  I don't really have any support. I keep telling myself that tomorrow will be the day I call the doctor and get myself back on my prescription meds, since they helped immensely back when I was first able to quit.  But then I end up getting high until 6 am and sleeping in until 1:30 when I have to work at 2.  I've tried throwing away my stash, but my dealer is my best friend.  Even if I wanted to forget his number I can contact him online if I need to.  Plus remembering his number doesn't help the situation much either. 




TL;DR:
Smoking pot ruined nearly every aspect of my life.  I was able to quit for 6 months but I relapsed and now I'm even worse than I was before I quit and I can't stop procrastinating.

I was in college and smoked a ton my last 2 years and it had dramatically negative affects on my grades because I had no self control.  I was constantly around people who smoked and could never say no.  All of my friends smoked, and always talked about smoking and even if a part of me didn't want to smoke, I could never pass up a free packed bowl.  I have since graduated college with a decent GPA (no where near what I was aiming for when i started college). 

I have now moved back home, but found a way to still smoke every day without getting caught.  After not having a job for a month now (after I completed my project at my last job), I have been sitting on my ass smoking every day and play video games and I have realized that I need to stop and move forward with my life.  So, that is why I quit.  The first few days were hard, like...fuck me i cant take a step without thinking about wanting to text my dealers.  So I did text my dealers, and guess what they were all out of town (A blessing in disguise).  Now on day 4 I am finally getting over the feeling of NEEDING to get high and it feels really damn good.  Here is where my problem is...I still have all of these friends back at school (My house is only a half hour away from campus) and they are always calling me to chill and I know that will always lead to smoking.  I really want to hang out with my friends but I know if I do, I will not be able to control myself and I will start this cycle all over again.  I also want to know if anyone has found a way to make themselves only smoke only once or twice a month because I would be completely ok with that.  Right now, weed is making me lazy and making me overlook the responsibilities I have, and I want that to stop.  Any advice on how to stay clean/how to force yourself to smoke occasionally would be greatly appreciated.

I'm a long time lurker, and by the end of this long long post, I realized that I pretty much made my introduction to /r/leaves unintentionally. I love what you guys do here, and nothing compares to the feeling of realizing that people have gone through exactly what you're going through. So here's my contribution I guess:

I'm 21 years old right now, but I remember loving high school; everything came pretty easily, whether it was friends, girlfriends, classes, errands, commitments, etc. I hit my first bong rip at 16, but I only smoked occasionally in high school. I think at most, I was smoking biweekly or so? Anyway, my junior year of high school, I was taking all AP classes (Calc BC, Physics C, Econ Macro/Micro, APUSH. Wow, I can't believe I remember that). I remember it being pretty demanding at the time... but I was motivated for the most part. I got all 4's and 5's, got into a Top 5 university and am planning to graduate with an engineering degree this year.

When I got into college, I started smoking a lot. It's been a pretty solid 1/8-1/4 weekly consumption since my first semester. The funny thing is that school never seemed too hard, but I just started getting bad grades. What I realized had happened-- my workload is at least twice as large now as it was in high school. Maybe three times. I know it's hard to believe, but it's true. To cope, I'd just smoke a little more, chill out. I'd still get most of my homework done, but it started getting harder to go to class. I'd miss a few due dates, fudge a few problems on some sets, but for the most part everything seemed fine. Then the midterm would come, I would study my ass off to make up for smoking all the time, and I'd do mediocre/okay.  But what it comes down to is that I don't have goals right now. I'm very uneasy about it right now... but I didn't even realize I didn't have goals until I stopped smoking this *Tuesday*. This is so huge, man. I've smoked so much that going home and toking was pretty much my only goal for the last three years. I don't know what I'm doing when I graduate; with my grades and the knowledge I have, it's gonna be really really hard to find a job. I probably won't get a great job, which I've come to terms with. I hope that if I do get an engineering job, that I won't hate it. I'm lost right now, not going to lie. This is the first time I've been *here* enough to be scared about how unmotivated I've been. And it's not that I chose the wrong major-- I was super passionate about engineering when I got into college-- but weed changes your priorites, subtly but surely. Years of mediocrity and general less-than-happiness has made it so I really don't know if I like what I'm learning.

The happiest people I know at school are those who are on top of their shit, and this is what smoking comes down to. They know what they want in life, they are fulfilled through pursuing these desires, and become confident when this results in success. I haven't been focused, fulfilled, or confident for the last three years. I can't truly describe myself as happy anymore, although that was probably what I was most known for being before college. I thought MJ made me happy, but if you're here you probably know that it's not true happiness. 

I wish you all the best of luck in your leaves endeavors, and hope that I get through mine! I'm on day 3 of quitting, and this is the 4th time I've actively quit weed (mostly t-breaks), with the average length of weed sobriety lasting like two months. These posts are all helping me get through this, and I hope I've contributed a little bit too :). 

**tl,dr: I went to college, and started smoking daily. I was on track to graduate with a great degree from a great school, and I now am finally clearheaded enough to realize I have absolutely no idea what the fuck I've been doing and have wasted the last three years. I've never wanted to help people make this decision as much as I do now, so please quit/moderate smoking if you really want to be happy and take advantage of being alive :)**",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_10yvbf,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/10yvbf/my_leaves_introduction_slightly_geared_towards/,

I had my surgery on Thursday, it went according to plan. The first night and next day the pain was pretty terrible, so my mother gave me a dilaudid so I could sleep through the night. (It's stronger than the Lortab I've been prescribed.)

They left for a weeklong vacation today, and them being out of the house is normally a huge trigger for me, but I talked about it with my therapist and I'm certain I'll stay strong.

I've been sleeping a lot, taking lots of baths and icing the area regularly.

Even with all the laxatives and stool softeners I was pretty stuffed up. Today I put on a glove, lubed it up with lidocaine jelly and manually removed a lot of fecal matter. I can poop regularly now, which is good, although it is bleeding more due to me poking around in there. I think it was necessary, though.

Yesterday I vomited due to the painkillers. I know that weed would help me right now, help me with the pain, the nausea and even relax my colon/sphincter enough to help with bowel movements, but I'm not as tempted as I thought I would be. My motivation is to not be a disappointment. I know how a lot of people would be disappointed in me if I fucked up, so I just keep reminding myself that.

I feel foggy, nauseous and all around gross. I have a headache. I've been binge-watching Orange is the New Black and trying not to think about the fact that my long distance lover is thinking about dating again. Our relationship is complicated and strange.

So here is your update.

If you're having trouble staying strong, remember that I had to stick my fingers up my asshole and pull poop out.

At least you don't have to do that.",,False,self,t5_2s9i3,False,,,True,t3_1kke0x,http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/1kke0x/day_94_had_anal_surgery_on_thursday/,
